No
If Trump would have just stopped fucking tweeting, he could have won this.

I don‚Äôt think he wants to win this.
What's stopping people from becoming volunteer counters and just not counting the votes they don't agree with? I imagine if you're a volunteer your kink is probably politics so your likely not neutral. I can't imagine there's not some people that have bad intentions volunteering.

So are mail in ballots really mostly pro-Biden or is that fake news? How do people even know? Polling?
Idk man. I am just a gambler
Even if 100% dem not moving the needle. So far Trump has the highest gap vs contender in Florida in the last 3 elections

why are retards here saying trump is winning, he‚Äôs got way less electoral votes than biden (118 vs 209), am i missing sumsing?

Wait so what do I do
r/politics closed their daily thread. What a bunch of cucks.
Makes sense thank you!
Both- it's called a strangle.  Or a straddle if you don't like a bunch of numbers.
I think in 2016 maybe? Again, that‚Äôs so hard to say because as unfair as it is to label him an outright socialist (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen him call for literal seizure of companies, anyway), it‚Äôs a moniker that doesn‚Äôt fly with older voters that lived through the Cold War, Dems included.

From there, sorry boys
1.6 million mail in ballots for Dems. 580,000 for repubs. 260,000 NPA. So like split that last one.

1.7 million votes for Biden vs the 700,000+500,000 current lead Trump has, probably will stay at that level.

64% of uncounted ballots are in counties Clinton won.

Biden wins in this not improbable scenario.

Do you even electoral college
The process to break a 269-269 tie is incredible.

Goes to house where each state gets one vote (not per rep, 1 per state)

Currently 26-24 GOP advantage but I believe it goes on newly elected congress. If one state flips to 25-25. They must stay locked in the room like they are voting on the Pope.

Some state would have to flip.

How far out and avg premium cost does everyone look for on these calls?
I'm in California in a high col area. Collective bargaining got us a 20% raise bringing us up closer, but still under, our peers in other states if you do it by cost of living. Sometimes you got to play the game and get involved to make sure things will go your way. A lot of people are spineless, but I'm fine with speaking out and don't really care if anyone is mad at me making me perfect in my leadership position.
Probably some Dec and Jan, gonna have to free up some money first but fuck it

True.
I always felt like he was sort of the dem counterpoint to trump.

Snarky, aggressive, says what he thinks, scrappy, etc etc. I always felt like he would do better against Trump than these moderate dems.

The fact that we never got to see that debate is a crime.
I actually think this proves the blame is on the pollsters. Models are only as good as their data

House of Representatives something something trump wins
 If neither candidate gets a majority of the 538 electoral votes, the election for President is decided in the House of Representatives, with each state delegation having one vote. A majority of states (26) is needed to win. Senators would elect the Vice-President, with each Senator having a vote. A majority of Senators (51) is needed to win.

Alabama voting in a fucking football coach as a senator. Jesus Christ my state lol talk about a puppet.
I'm not a big fan of Unions. The heart of the union is to milk money. Luckily I don't have to pay dues. But the extent of the support offered to me is limited to being a bargaining chip. Suffice to say I haven't had a pay raise in years.

So it's an all or nothing with them. If I felt they were more concerned with the actual employee than the coffers I would be singing a different tune. But money breeds corruption.

There is a whole lot more people that hated Hilary personally than Biden.
HEXO has a reverse split planned FYI
All the votes that have been counted so far are in red counties. The cities and other blue areas have very little counted
I don‚Äôt think anyone is ever ready to ‚Äúeat dick.‚Äù
Same. Annoying as fuck.
Either way I think anyone who includes 2020 polling research in the morning resume should be blacklisted.
Florida is still not being called because the Postmaster General defied a judge‚Äôs order to locate 300,000 missing ballots from 12 postal districts. Miami and Tampa are two of those districts.

We're not.
NIO gonna tank anyway, momentum has been leaking out that bitch for a couple weeks now.
Nevada polls still open bc they stayed out at the strip clubs last night
Nah
BREAKING: nothing has changed since 5 minutes ago
Markets just want a clear winner you dimwits. They don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs Joe or Orange man. It‚Äôs a narrow Joe win and a contested election that will fuck us
That Cathie lady added more BABA today to her funds. Maybe I should still diamond-hand my BABA Jan/Feb calls?
This is the way.
Sure! Make sure they‚Äôre all at a loss, though.

FOX is calling it for Trump. Not sure if that's what you're looking for.
Nope

Market don't care. Market wants clear result, and it's less clear now.
I got about 10 text messages today from different numbers to tell me to go vote Democrat today. Not to mention the thirty Ive got the last two weeks. Who would think this is a good idea??? I told them to lose my number but then another number would just text me.  It was infuriating.
I see a civil war brewing on WSB

Everyone was too busy betting on the election to actually vote.
lmao MSM propping up liberal hopes by not calling TX, FL, OH, MI, and so on. it's sad, really. but i guess they need the liberal eyeballs for a few hours or days
People are embarrassed to be voting for Trump so they lie in polls lol. They want a republican in power but Trump is their only choice so they fall in line

Just wait for -4% and then you‚Äôll be begging for 2%
They‚Äôre callin shit all over the place and way ahead of anyone else tonight. They called Arizona for joe...

As bad as Mitch is, I can respect him for being a consistent asshole.  He knows what he wants and he goes after it even if it fucks everyone else. Lindsey on the other hand flip flops and sucks anyone's dick he can. He is a spineless turd
Which one is that?
‚≠êÔ∏è
Yep
2.2M mail in ballots in PA... has to go Bidens way. Would be big surprise if it didn't.
Ones that insist we show up. Not that we do much.
Trump is orange which is closer to black and brown than white. Simple science.
Bernie's party pulled the rug on him both times.  I'm still not really sure how he fell off this time around.
I guess saying our main focus is to TRY to make money is more accurate.

This is the way. We don't do politics here.

Shit‚Äôs over commies. Try again in 4 years
Nevada's been smoking that blue sky and forgot about the election all together.
well I just don't understand how it would make stocks go down, no matter who wins we get a stimulus and we are already recovering from that panic sell off last week so idk why investors wouldn't buy back in now before the stimulus
Florida fuckin rules. Always fuck with the election. Did they check the local Hummer dealership?
Definitely, Biden is like a regurgitation feed for whatever opinions poll the best, same as Hilary and most national politicians before
I‚Äôll save one for you

risky comment. U know his followers believe he‚Äôs done nothing wrong right?
I can‚Äôt find this news anywhere. Are you trolling or are you ahead of my google? 
If so calls or puts tomorrow
They‚Äôre assuming the Dems regulation efforts will fall flat if GOP retains Senate control.
Ahh okay. I mean basically at this point we dont know and wont know.
If all goes as usual bellwethers tell, trump has it. Valencia, NM; Vigo, IN and Ohio all republican
The only way to ensure the people have to decided is to count all the votes. Now, if the state doesn‚Äôt meet its own deadline, that‚Äôs a discussion to be had in 3 days. 

Something to really consider is the logistics of what a nationwide election entail. It‚Äôs an absolutely massive undertaking managed by a contingent of citizens that are partially volunteers. It amazes me some states start counting today and will report numbers as well. And that‚Äôs with shit a turnout; not the case this year.
is there a term for it?

i always thought odds are ratios, like 1:10, or 1:40, etc.

lmfao accurate
Idk jd up huge in hk. At ath
Bruh quit saying he won those states that‚Äôs literally not how this works. PA and MI won‚Äôt finish counting until later this week, and they‚Äôll probably singlehandedly decide the election

1.6 Million dem ballots compared to 580,000 republicans and then 260,000 NPA. Mail-ins probably haven‚Äôt even been reported yet. With a 500,000 vote lead currently, that still is destroyed by the 1.6 million.

"So I was just walking down the street and there was this chap selling his automobile for 100$. I thought about it for a while and then it occured to me why not invest the same 100$ in buying naked Calls? This guy just writes on the board that he lost all his money on the stock market and needs it in cash and gives me the best idea of my life. So I put the 100$ in options that day and my life takes a major turn over. Now I'm living the American Dream."

Weird how FOX has. But 200,000 votes is a sizable lead with 76% reporting
Ok but for real a cramer/powell ticket would be unreal for markets
lol even if he gives it all to joe he still loses it
I was just thinking if there was no clear winner tonight +2% to -2%?
Great outlet, I thought it was gonna be a bad idea but letting loose was a terrific way to blow off some steam.
Don't think I wiped completely but I'm too addicted to watching results come in to go to the bathroom.
Lmao fox called that 3 hours ago haha hahah
Wtf is happening in Nevada lol
On the plus side, maybe predictit will actually be useable tomorrow but I‚Äôm not optimistic
Nope you can't
It was always going to be contested anyways. He‚Äôs a classic sore loser, always has been. He would contest this even if it was a blowout for Joe
Only thing that matters is whether we're getting that big ass stimulus or not

Pricing in Biden squeak out victory.
I think if nasdaq futures are above 3% -> pricing Trump win. 
Between 1 and 3 -> Biden win
So far I‚Äôve only seen Fox call it
He is down by over 1Mil pop votes now.
Seriously who wins?
I think because our main focus is making money.
Vix gonna rocket!
If Biden fails in PA, He will really gab it.

This is why we can‚Äôt discuss politics on this sub, because of people like this.

Why can‚Äôt it just be about the data analysis and not about our own bias?

I'm not just a union guy, but local leadership. Libertarian believe it or not. I'm not super into unions, but as I'm a union worker I aim to be able to influence my own fate by being locally elected leadership.

Trump victory fading
Ohio going pump üòé
Futes are like a war zone!
Wisconsin is in trumps favor by 5.1% with 78.88% of the vote in. I think trump wins Wisconsin and Michigan. If he does that and wins Iowa(which he‚Äôs leading in), assuming North Carolina is a given win for trump, he doesn‚Äôt even need Pennsylvania to win.
How do they know that? Pretty sure votes are still being tallied.

yeah but u don‚Äôt have absentee ballots counted in Michigan that‚Äôs expected to be 55% of the total votes and there‚Äôs only 15% of them counted, same for Pensylvania, they won‚Äôt be ready till atleast tmrw or the day after, shits not even close to being over, expect it to take a couple days
Someone find the drill team and tell them to stop the circle jerk
Damn beat me to it.
boycott arizona, never step foot there, never drive there. they wont earn a penny off of us after what they have just cost us
Its a byproduct of how the electoral college is designed. Because the flyover states (the empty place i call home) get 3 electors no matter what it doesn't matter if california has 80 times the population of Wyoming. They only get 20 times the electors.

OHIO let‚Äôs goooo
Mail in ballots and big cities still have votes to count. That's going to be the x-factor.
They gotta get the meth residue off the ballots
Mail in ballots.
A lot of mail in ballots for PA, MI, and WI. Going to make this a stressful week for the market haha. With AZ for Biden, these are the states it will come down to.

1.6 million for Dems vs 580,000 for Repubs in PA alone. With 260,000 NPA. Based on mail in voting data available through electproject.GitHub.io
why contested?
# THANK YOU ARIZONA FOR SAVING MY PUTS

# ALSO THANK YOU TO RUPERT MURDOCH FOR GIVING AZ TO BIDEN
Map guy 2024
Fox News could taste the Trump landslide and then Arizona happened.  They are getting pissy just like CNN.
How is it bullshit?  Pennsylvania has 1.6 million Democrat ballots and 500,000 Republican ballots to process.  You don‚Äôt think that might change the results slightly?

If Trump is the worst politician in modern history... acting like a complete buffoon...  allowing 200k people to die during a pandemic... and you LOSE to him.. what does that make you?
Yea but if you only have X amount out and the difference doesn‚Äôt cover it you can assume there is a 0% chance. You just need the majority of them to run the numbers
Tell me about it, all I did was call them idiots, and I lost so much karma

My dead great grandpa who lived in Hungary just mailed in for Biden in PA. Looking like a Biden landslide there. #BlueWave

He's said Senate, several times
You won.
Not based on his performance amongst the demographics in this state and avg nationwide performance vs. Polling. V bullish for Biden rn.
Maybe like 8 points?
Melania in shambles that mango has a chance.
red probably
Wisconsin 69%
This is definitely going to get contested 100%, We can all agree on AT LEAST that

Contested election still might be in play. Gonna be a wild week and I can‚Äôt wait to lose money

He will have to win NV, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania but by then biden will already be at 270. Going to steal iy from under his feet. Stopped counting for the night in several states. Never saw that before. Trump won TX but not calling. Not calling any states he is winning. Ask yourself why? THEY ARE CRIMINALS..
Bruh why can‚Äôt we have live feature anymore in mobile üò£

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt blame me I voted for JC2020‚Äù
Biden will take the lead in MI and WI with mail in vote later tonight. Biden will be declared President-elect at 6am tomorrow morning. Then this will head to the courts
[deleted]
I dunno about you guys but if you bought puts hoping for worst case scenario it sure looks like you‚Äôre gonna get it. Some states counting votes for as long as 10 more days, unclear winner, if the late votes swing expect lawsuits and unrest, split house / senate, etc. I ain‚Äôt buying this futures pump until I see it closed tomorrow at 4pm.
Regardless of outcome, Trump does not care about the stock market anymore. Either 4 more years and no more terms, or Dems are coming to power-
Blue M&M MABA!
PA is going to be the lifeline for either at this point

My karma got nuked for shit posting in r/politics for saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôd jerk Biden off just to be able to unload another vote into trumps mouth‚Äù
Because they're almost to a point where the democrats can't win even with mail ins.
I analyze this stuff for hours a day. Not saying this as a partisan stance. Biden now the strong favourite IMO.

Even at a 269-269 tie which is now a real possibility Biden becomes president due to house.
might dip one last time tm before that shit shoots up again
More of a soggy waffle imo
[removed]
Looking like we might not have a clear decision tonight. Markets don‚Äôt like that
Good point. Actually haven‚Äôt seen anyone bring that up yet
-145/+110
If futures are up, say 100 points. What do we expect SPY to open at?
Trump is leading in every single swing state he won in 2016 (except for Arizona) with a much higher margin than last time. He obviously won.

Last time he won in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania by less than 0.5%, now he's leading each state by more than 5%. This shit is over. Biden is finished.
Short memory guys: we‚Äôre going into contested elections mode, a few key states will only have final results by EOW and it will be tight. Hang on.

( only got 1 thread is moving too quick )
Terrible play. His wang couldn't possibly go down any more.
Start campaigning for a third term probably
If vix actually measuree volatility it would literally be over 100% up right about now
trumpers disappeared real quick lmao
At least twice recently he's asked for your vote for his run for Senate.  And [today](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8909537/Joe-Biden-starts-election-day-attending-morning-mass-visiting-son-Beaus-grave-Delaware.html) he called his granddaughter the name of his late son.   So maybe not.   I think it's sad really, he has obvious dementia and no one steps in.
So why isn‚Äôt everyone throwing their life savings at TQQQ calls then
bruh wtf we were up 2% and now barely up .7%, what the fuck
lol idk
I was playing with the map and that‚Äôs where I settled as well
Sorry I‚Äôm an idiot, can someone hypothesize why tech futures are ripping so bigly?
Puts on pton
Thinking Michigan will go Trump and Wisconsin breaks for Biden after more % reports. Will see.

Penn is going to be the war zone.
Boys they're gonna stretch the fuck out of this aren't they? So what SPY puts if its still contested by open tomorrow?

Nah, chill im still holding calls üòÇ
I don‚Äôt know what the fuck the market wants lol
I'm showing 287 electoral votes for Trump, not including Iowa or Virginia. He can afford to lose any one of PA/MI/WI/OH and still win (can lose PA only if pick up IA).

Now imagine how 6 will feel

Nice fence sitting there son
Tommorow Trump is going to try to shutdown the absentee counting in Pennsylvania. SPY 325 EOW.
What were the betting odds prior to the election?
Biden most likely for Nevada
My union is gonna be sending out some wild emails this week
The worst part of all this is the at&t in the upper left
Somebody is projecting
You didnt hold?
Checked my iTunes playlist and only saw Kanye on there.  Kanye‚Äôs always been there in my iTunes.  Fucker got my vote
You don't think it's weird that so many votes somehow vanished? Or are you going to ignore it because your candidate is winning?

Guessing you're going to ignore it, and you'll probably ignore the fact that Trump instantly called fraud too
ü•≠ win means. RIP MSM, dem campaign, pollsters. 

Nobody's gonna ever trust pollsters ever again. I think degenerates like us do better DD than pollsters.

Wtf happened to futures?
Daughter is a successful business owner and mother of 3 children. Multi millionaire from her personal business before entering politics. His other two sons are not on video smoking drugs and getting paid by China and Russia. 

Bidens son is a literal meth addict who fucks hookers and gets foot jobs from skanks he gets high with. He's also getting paid by China and Russia. His daughter is a recovering drug addict. 

Real class that Biden family is. Seethe more.
Happy Cake Day!
if market is red by open. republicans = red = win?
Babe, stop
But today morning we were told market is bullish on Biden‚Äôs win. I think futures are looking at contested case. Both the candidates are coming close.
No lie, that‚Äôs what my sister and brother in law walked into their wedding reception to.
If Donnie wins NIO is going to tank tomorrow
It‚Äôs a clown market rn. All a fugazi
Donald Trump -170 Joe Biden +130

62% / 43%

(Doesn't total 100% because the house always wins)
Wouldn‚Äôt be fun without a little volatility
That‚Äôs a lot....
Trump is up by 600k I suspect it's going to get to a point where even the mail ins would make it impossible to win.
Right - Biden was a heavy favorite going into tonight and now Trump is the favorite
Fuck Pennsylvania - they quit counting for the night
No body thought trump would win. Every poll pointed to landslide Biden.
I almost panic sold my puts today, but then i remembered that I was ALWAYS counting on post election insanity and so far everything is going perfectly according to plan üçª
Jyeap
So is Nevada just like not voting?
What are you smoking ?
I'm sorry brother.
It's not going to be decided tonight most likely. Maybe not till Friday
I hope this lady turns up, if Trump wins that is:

I‚Äôm preparing myself for when somehow all of the absentee votes go to Biden lol. 

The market has got me conditioned to believe that all systems are rigged.
Voting in person during a pandemic should count for two votes because you need bigger balls.
Abacus is hard üßÆ
Seriously. What is mango gonna do for the next four years? His only goal was to get re-elected. Lmao
All that matters is path to Victory even if you have 260 electoral votes and are winning if you can't win any more States then you lost.

Question to you isn't whether Biden is ahead it's how many more states do you think he can win and is that enough to put him over 270
My late father had a picture of Ronald Reagan in his office. On this all nighter I'm ordering one of Donald John Trump for mine. What an absolutely amazing, honorable, and inspirational Man.

If only they would create a separate branch of government that proposes and creates laws, we could split it into two houses to give everyone an equal representation and then another one based on population.
They started later on those, so yes, current counts don‚Äôt mean much. AZ is honestly massively bullish for Biden, it became the most important state in the election after Biden lost NC, FL and GA.

Wrong song bot
Hey, where do you see the odds? Wanna track them live
AZ looks good for him
Or just start counting ballots early.... there was no reason to wait to the last minute other than to just cause drama. And only a few state did it so that way they could get all the attention because they are attention whores

why?
Euro poors always dump
Lmao I have VXX, SQQQ and ICLN calls RIP me
it surged insanely, like 6%, when futures started mooning, and now they just reversed, suggesting investors are fleeing into bonds. it doesn't look good for equities based on that
Softbank wins
It's second smallest after yours she said
This has been a really fun night to be alive, if anything
Dump eeeet
Gamestop probably still has a lot of those old Madden and Call of Duty games they gave you a quarter for on the shelves somewhere, just take them back.
Man, if it actually ends up being massive popular vote win for Biden but electoral college win for Trump once more there will be some fucking crazy shit going down, lmao.
Futures traders
I think bears are going to have a field day for the next 3 days while PA decides to get its shit together and learn how to count.
Im pretty neutral but ü•≠ shitting on McCain while him being a draft dodger done it for me. But democracy at play so amen to that. It just plagues me that most of murica don't care about character, values, morale, principles etc. Just scary.
Market knows all.
I'm edging just thinking about it...
PA, its all up to ya'll 

Good luck üëç
Because they aren‚Äôt blow outs that can be called quickly
Fuck mail in ballots. Have everyone vote in person over the course of the week with a Nov 3 deadline. This is ridiculous.
They were asking for things to literally help you!
Its not just 3 states biden needs to turn....it looks like its coming down to 3 states now. 

I don't want him to win, but if I was a betting man and I am, right now at this moment, I'd put my money on ü•≠. Hope I'm wrong...
Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of simps
Hmm, the news keep showing Biden is ahead.  So wtf.. who's up?

Nio is Chinese... it doesn't need an American Presidents help are you stupid

It will be hilarious to see both side completely flip their position. Dems defending the electoral, and Repubs screaming it should be the popular.
We are the monkeys
These betting odds make no sense. Biden at +190 with this map?

Biden can still definitely lose, easily, but those seem like good-ass odds for a Biden Yolo right now.
r/politics won't even let you say the word riot
We are not going to know tonight.
If it wasn't for covid and Dems doing everything they can try tank the economy it would've been a red landslide
You‚Äôre a fucking legend mods flair this man
oh ok i see what you mean now.
Nate Silver is going to hold on to Trump losing longer than he's holding onto that fucked up hairline. Bro get a razor your entire hair situation, head and facial is a disgrace.
Mail in votes tend to lean dem though
I like Biden. He seems honest genuine and not creepy
Don't like the man, but gotta hand it to him. He's grabbing this as hard as he can üçë
Fcking call FL already omg
nah there is 2 mil mail in ballot to count
looks like a clear winner won‚Äôt be decided today. means uncertainty means high vix
Shiii... maybe one day we will have a black president. Peace and Love

Just realized we‚Äôre all looking at maps of people voting, it literally doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre all retarded. Electoral college can still vote for whichever side they want in the swing states
Idk. I saw a few posts a couple weeks back that said don't believe the election week drop hype and to buy the dip the week before.  Had crayon charts and everything. I just kept my Nio shares and said fuck the rest just in case though.
PA needs to figure out how many votes to find
[deleted]
I‚Äôm looking at googles live results and trump definitely gonna win Florida
Vix back on the menu
We seriously may not know until Friday or Monday lol
Agreed. And i feel like people are missing the signs that this is kamalas election. Biden wont last for 4 years. They are using bidens name to get kamala in
Donnie didnt even try, and he is still winning? üòÇüòÇ
The suspense makes money
Biden might as well be a vote for theta gang.

Fuck you theta gang. My straddles do not like you.
Imagine not understanding how timelines work.  Imagine not understanding the obscenely simple fact that the Yuan started tanking from a stable level at the exact same time Trump started winning.  Imagine thinking the two are uncorrelated.  Imagine not realizing China has wanted Biden from day 1.
Lol idiot
VIX pumps and we have a fun ride
Man, you demos are always so aggressive. Good luck with that hate dude.
not knowing is not good
I think u just got banned
Closer than I expected
##DD: Knife edge election not decided for weeks, election lawsuits, civil unrest and Corona cases smashing through 120k is going to make the market absolutely tank over the next week.
At this point I don‚Äôt know who the market wants to wjn
100% agree!!!

I guess I was coming on it from the angle of that‚Äôs what republicans hide behind

Separation of church and state fuck!

Bears down but not out Hahha wtf is happening
Wtf does it take so long to count things - that‚Äôs what we should be upset about as Americans
What the fuck is a 32x long derivative?
Lol, Fox News is the only one that called AZ for Biden.
Because this is all a show. Every single time there‚Äôs an election it‚Äôs gotta be a big show. Can‚Äôt just be clean or we wouldn‚Äôt be dealing with doubt
Don't count Jo Jorgensen out. If she wins, all weed companies up, government contractors down, awesome up.
No, just fucking no
Still pretty close race, Biden has a good chance of winning PA after they finish counting all the mail-in votes, he just needs to get lucky on one of the other swing states.
It's a troll. They are common here. You just paid your toll.
Futures are looking beautiful. It‚Äôs pretty close on the polls rn.
Florida man stories.
Yeah volume was fucking TRASH!! I was gonna get back into too, but it just won‚Äôt budge!!!
update?
This is going to be close with Az going to Biden. Then if the mail in ballots lean heavily to Biden you bet your ass Trump is taking this to court
[deleted]
And Michigan and Ohio

WSB always follows the trend. If Trump is up, that's what WSB will upvote.

Although I have not seen a negative trend towards Biden/Democrat posts.
But you can't win if you don't play.
CNN trying to act like they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt thrilled they have 4 more years of trump shenanigans to cover
Will they finalize realize it‚Äôs an echo chamber on not representative of everybody else? Probably not

Isnt it like a million ballots
Arizona win is absolutely massive for Biden. He doesn't even need PA now if he takes WI, MI & MN
You're welcome, man!
Again? Lol
The way they counted the votes so unevenly is how you start chaos
Ah yes the Trump family isn‚Äôt a gang of degenerates.
We, in PA don't work at night bruh. We will start counting tomorrow. Lol
We green as fuck. You have puts or what?
Was Arizona called early?
They really thoughtü§£ clowns
That probably true. I think either would cause wall street to shower them with success in the market. And you don‚Äôt forget an early win.

Why would we buy puts? We know tromp will push us into the next 4 year bull run
I can't wait for Biden to get on air and send his congratulations to George Bush for his win today.
Can I have it
Because he hasn‚Äôt won until WI and PA count all their votes
Hell no market needs Biden
Probably unmade a lot more millionaires on that tech jump lol

Yes that is why annually more people move to the US from Canada than the other way around.

China is raping us via asymmetric tariffs. Trump is the only politician from both parties who brought that forward. Now fuck off and quit expecting everything to be spoon fed. Maybe go talk to someone who makes a living farming or ranching.
calls on weed and puts on china. one gotta hit right after the elections?
The US is meant to be a federal alliance of states, the purpose of the electoral college is to protect the more rural states from being completely pushed around by the more densely populated states. Without the electoral college the California would effectively rule the US. I can't see the rural states ever agreeing to eliminate the electoral college.

Qcom: the tsla of 99 baby.
The reporting on AP shows Trump pulling 280 without Nevada and Alaska and the popular vote
As far as hispanics go, maybe the Cubans? I honestly dunno myself. And with the black voters, it's probably cause of Biden's flimsy history regarding his views on race.

Here comes joeeeeee
Surprised futes are still green.  It looks like we are going to get exactly the nightmare scenario.  The states that decide the election are the ones that told us it would take days to finish counting the votes, and we likely go to bed tonight not knowing who the winner is.

The fact that anyone would vote for Biden who shows clear signs of early onset dementia is mind blowing.

They really think this guy would be a force for the US and fight for this countries interest against the rest of the world? Guys whole family is a gang of degenerates and he's the best we can get for the US. 

Can't believe it's this close.
Futures def made a few millionaires tonight, not here, but somewhere.
im serious bro why the fuk u laughin at me
People saying futures mooning must‚Äôve not had their phones two hours ago, after AZ, we need a definitive MI or WI for futes to moon again. PA no chance is figured out tonight
Yo mama
Nobody knows shit. The most we know are scenarios.
Most of early votes are not yet in
Ya, the inner city trash school districts are a mess, hence the voting.
Bro. It's hilarious this is your first time voting. Go fuck yourself kid
We're all too exhausted
Nowhere in the Bible does it say anything about abortions, or weed for that matter - repubs would get so much support if they caught up with the times

No party is against this. 

I'm tired of Americans fighting over shit we fucking agree on, that's idiotic. It only benefits our enemies.
what's the SPCE earning play?
lmao
Unfortunately,  I'm at work for 30 more minutes. Give me an hour or so.
so market was pricing in a blue wave, then futures started pricing in a red wave, I think this will be too close and courts will be tasked to work it out, might be biased with my uvxy calls
Ew. She‚Äôs a fuckin idiot lol
I wouldnt be surprised. Yuan is tanking rn
How the fuck are futures up when this clearly go on longer.  Of course I got ü¶ÉüçÜ on puts already this week.  Maybe these 11/30 p will print.

Trump down to -185 on the odds - things have tightened up. Was at -800 at one point. Arizona changed things
Mail in ballots for PA:

1.6 **million** for democrats.
586,000 Republican
260,000 NPA.
 
So his 500,000 he‚Äôs ahead by right now (most likely all in person votes) still puts him behind even if he takes all the NPA and Republican mail in ballots.
Yeah like 2 hours ago. I actually made a difference today with my vote fckn hype
Tomorrow night
Just look at the math and the projections and the remaining vote % based on population.
He gained Cuban voters with the socialism fear thing.

He lost other Latino voters though, big time, which is why Arizona just flipped blue.
No riots. I think Sleepy wins
Expect it. Election won‚Äôt be resolved for several days minimum
*Exhales in covered calls*
Yeah, it's like the "If everyone's talking about it, you've already missed it" kinda deal. See: Pokimane asking about options right before the March crash
It's because the bulk of blue votes in PA, WI and MI are not in yet
Did you expect anything else?

Trump raw dogging bears tonight üá∫üá∏
So whats the deal with PA? are we not gonna know who won before friday?
Who's winning the elections?
Biden is up 10% in the most populated AZ county and polls just closed in El Paso where Biden should receive a large chunk of votes. Texas shouldn‚Äôt flip but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot closer than AZ.
NC could be the savior
That's what I'm thinking...  It's could take days to count the Millions of Mail-in ballots to determine this election, and Mango would probably declare himself the winner and the lawsuits will start....  My UVXY Calls better print.
Probably down
Fuck that dumb bitch
Fuck the presidential race who‚Äôs winning senate majority?
why
Some of those lines are straight, one is clearly üåàüêª.
They should probably figure it the fuck out
WI, MI still only like 60% votes counted. Pennsylvania will be counting mail in votes well after the election too
Reported 60-1 in favor?

Did the media open up all the mail in ballots, tally the votes and reseal them or something?
Was just there. Lotsa youngsters want free shit. Clinton ‚Äò96 all over again. BTW good for them.
Lol all the people going ‚Äúhaha Trump won again. Feasting on lib tears for days!‚Äù....these are the same people who brag that their puts will print overnight only for them to open at .01.

Regardless of the outcome, how the heck did Trump GAIN black and hispanic voters?
Several states legalizing it.

How can you vote for corrupt Biden and think you're the good guy?

Tbf, I lose money often betting against the fomo train... sometimes it prints tho.
Arizona blue?

This election is weird af.


Guess Trump's socialism thing worked for the Cubans in Florida, but his "bad hombres/rapists/shithole countries" shtick didn't work for Mexican Americans.

Whoops.
CNN is Robinhood of political maps.
What are you talking about?

I'm just saying there's no way that's not retarded to say Republicans are the majority
This is all gonna be close. Good time to be a lawyer in play lol
That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm leaving the US and going to Puerto Rico!
Let's go back an hour and look at the euphoria that was proclaiming trump as the winner
r/news is awfully quiet tonight
whichever state is taking that long to report should be fired

sleepy wouldve won if he chose AOC as vp
But seriously, we can‚Äôt let him get his hands on the nuclear codes
Qualcomm?
Contested because Wisconsin and Penn won‚Äôt be done counting votes at least until Friday. Many states aren‚Äôt used to mail in votes.
OH, PA, MI, WI, TX are the most important states to capture.
What are you following right now?  I have Reuters and NYT open but I‚Äôm leaning more towards Reuters
I heard it may tank, Yuen has dropped. I think it will only be temporarily

All 3 states delayed their mail in ballot counting.  It‚Äôs gonna be a shitshow

Biden is gonna win PA with all the mail in votes coming in (reported 60-1 in favor of Biden), putting him at about 260 electoral votes (after winning AZ and NH), he just needs one more swing state and he wins.

PA has until Friday to count mail in ballots. Regardless of what the president says, the respective Secretaries of State decide their process, not the president.
I actually shorted nq at 11400 so I‚Äôm hoping for a quick crash then lengthy uptrend
Looks the same to me
i think the pollsters just straight up lied to make money on these betting sites. heheh! That's one way to recoup all the money they lost in 2016
Go for it brother; I‚Äôm banned already
If futures flip to red I‚Äôm gonna shit my pants
Yeah ik, read my edit lol
AZ clutched up
[deleted]
Reminds me of some breaking bad shit
hoes mad
Dems are gonna tank the market with this ‚Äúno counting until tomorrow‚Äù in PA even though they have the votes there. What a joke.
No verdict
If you feel the urge to comment about futures, look at what time the rally started and look at what time it is now.

Your ‚ÄúHoLy FuCk FUtUrES‚Äù and shit is just wasted fucking time. 

Post some DD instead you fucking morons. 

We fucking KNOW what futures look like, we don‚Äôt fucking care about your surprised feeling of seeing futures.
Weekly OTM QQQ calls isnt a portoflio? Who knew
Kanye got 10,000 votes in Tennessee
I‚Äôve blocked so many people on that sub I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be any to post on anything that‚Äôll aim veiws
Meaningless with only half the votes counted, with likely heavy democratic bias on the mail ins they‚Äôve barely opened yet
A Pennsylvania tie breaker holding shit up til Friday
If this ends 269/269 I'll come out looking like Quagmire after his weeklong binge.
Yes, trapfactory has it backward
If you have calls, SELL at open tomorrow. Delayed mail in ballots could change everything. Market is gonna be volatile af either way
Someone call the lawyers and hail the elevator
Won't that sell off if Trump wins? Lol
This is gonna drag on

Mail in votes need to come in first.
I just got 40+ downvotes there lol
Yup
Can we put the theory that stuff is priced in and  accept that the market is controlled by the major players
Bold prediction: NIO will tank tomorrow and next few days. (Temporarily)
I'd take Biden on heroin, riding a pony wearing assless chaps carrying a picture of him in a 3 way with Epstein and Micheal Jackson over that moron Trudeau
Yup, and this fake ass pump is gonna crash so fucking hard.
Oo TGT er in 2 weeks also. I think they both crush tbh.
Silver lining. Good shit man.
Zero mail in ballots so far
So... Business as usual?
[deleted]
I like Biden's chances more now than i did an hour ago
Uber wants prop 22 to pass. It let's them keep their drivers as contractors...
So are we really not going to know the results tonight? I mean I knew we might not but this fuckin sucks
Considering they refuse to call Florida, it's odd.
He bought in at about 40:60 odds so around 12.5 million
[deleted]
[deleted]
Just following the news!
it is
Ill admit when I'm wrong. This shit is going to get contested and shits about to get dramatic af
Every time a polling company called me I said Biden just to fuck with the numbers.
I need answers!

PA sus
Joe Biden
I have small dick
AZ is a traitor to our portfolios
from -350 to -200 now on bodog
Or because they hit limit up
Dumb.  People can't just up and move to Canada
Different states different rules for counting votes
ü•≠ should have respected war hero John McCain.
PTON needs some of that love
Looking at nyt and what votes are left likely trump wins Wisconsin + Michigan
[deleted]
USA has 0 to little effect on them. No sales in the us, production in the us, etc. maybe a pullback but its grown as much as it has this year with trump in office. I think ill be fine
[deleted]
What would it take for Futes to flip back to red?
They were only battlegrounds cuz he was on the defensive. Pa is the true decider and they have counted zero mail in ballots so far
He is rich, so we make fuck.
Feel like a pass out on the couch is imminent. Hit the bottle a little too hard. Unsure of whether I will check election results or futes first upon waking up
Covfefe
LOL
Bad for the market = everything goes up
[The Chinese Yuan tonight.](https://kekpe.pe/i/5fa21dac39748.PNG)

You've been brainwashed.
Why
Technically Biden is way ahead on electoral college votes, but a ton of red states are not finished yet, so that gap will close a lot, very quickly.
That's electoral counts dummy

As in states that are called
Trashy ass Arizona
ü§î
They were asking for too much extra stuff.
AZ Flipped.
Trump looks so much better bald.
id nut
Mangos a moon
And still finds time to slam hookers
Na lockdowns and mask mandates
Thank you! Are you a fellow Oregonian or just following the news?
TTD seems like it‚Äôs going to explode tomorrow
Doesn't he still have a chance? He took AZ.
Turns out being pretty good in the looks department and able to read a teleprompter is harder than it seems.
Pen still too early, less than 50% reporting.
Oddly, I think we'd get way more done that way.  Trump is not that hard to manipulate into being decent, it's just a matter of who he's talking to.
Cgc calls gonna print tomorrow
Dude Trump has 0 impact on cannabis stocks. It‚Äôs the states voting on legalization.
Arizona just fucked everything up
I don't feel as bad when my poor decisions lead me to losing money as opposed to jumping on some FOMO train and losing money because everyone else was doing it
Rip your heart
is there actual legit news that calls states anymore?!?! this is a sitcom/reality show tease.. im neutral and its over. downvote at will dont care

Sleepy Joe is sleepy
I‚Äôm up on futures for the evening so I‚Äôm going to let Jesus take the wheel and wait this out into open
Now he‚Äôs driving
Nah if you look at futures it looks like we are crashing hard af tomorrow
Florida can count like 11,000,0000 votes in 5 hours. What the fuck are MI, WI and PA doing
So is NIO going to 41 or not?
Im extremely bullish on it but it doesn‚Äôt move as freely as TGT, it should be at 150 already

I have equally boomer BA calls
Bro look at the futes
If Kanye doesn‚Äôt squeeze out a win, I‚Äôll be disappointed
Guess what. It's still super possible for 269-269. HOW FUCKING FUN WOULD THAT BE! VIX would look like jizzed-out Randy marsh
da bulls
Can i hope nio goes up too... i know biden woulda helped more
Aaaay! Just lemme see a big green dildo before my calls expire. Then you can tank my stocks or protest or whatever the fuck.
Hahah - 100% ü§£
What if he loses
Expect all brokers to crash tomorrow at open

why? Ik you guys aren‚Äôt my personal financial advisors but I‚Äôm just tryna learn.
wow, calling AZ for Biden changes it.    Futures are following.
Mango will win and we will crash
100 shares at 9.50 30 dollar stock in no time
I think because the total vote number is a prediction, they aren't sure exactly how many total votes there are until they're counted. Maybe? idk
Including prescription drugs?  Prescription drugs or no balls
Orange man good
Same :/ bought a shit ton of calls on the lows of last week. Bittersweet
Wow i haven‚Äôt seen Nasdaq this green in awhile
Futures already coming down, I wonder if that's because its looking more and more like a contested election.
We legalized in NJ, letsgoo
Didn‚Äôt Brian Williams flame out few years ago? How is he .... somewhat respectable again on MSNBC?
Regardless of what polls say. It doesn't look like he will flip enough needed states. If we're are waiting on 3 states to finish counting tomorrow and trump is up by 300k in those its unlikely biden wins if head needs more than one.
Lol probably 350 at this point
AZ flipping blue for Biden has straight spooked Fox News
Do you think Biden already went to bed tonight?
They will tie at 269 a piece and theta will fuck us all
ngl, thought it would be closer
I think Melania got it last time. This time i think it goes to Ivanka
Shoulda took Biden  +400
Thats fine but literally you said something factually incorrect like it was historical record. We literally would have had a 2nd check in our pockets if republicans passed the bill the democrats literally passed. No one took your money than republicans which is literally what they always do unless you are super rich.
House already went blue so no
They‚Äôve been expanding since the 70‚Äôs and like 50 years before that
Melanie gonna have to lick ass if he wins. Donnie gets his stimulation before she gets the package
There‚Äôs always been a disconnect between the electorates. You‚Äôve obviously got outliers but the biggest correlation is actually highest education achieved, not income.
Shannon Bream is such a Milf
Quadruple witched!
Trump 420 Biden 269 ;)
HK is pro USD smart boi. Jina is who is going to get clapped.
Uhhh I got these TQQQ calls sooooo fuck yeah bro the Trump train gonna take us to tendie town
What would mother say
He's had the therapy bro, not happening anymore
Biden is winning the states that matter, northeast and West coast
We're not gonna know who wins tonight, either way that's bad for the market
Might as well make it interesting and break the markets with a single tweet.
Dana Perino has those nice DSL.
Lol do you seriously even need to ask that question?

Oh, of course. Liberals can't think right. Either that or they sniff the same cocaine that Biden is on.
What these 3 states are so significant?
LOL. his betting chances are popping with the Arizona win
Don't get me wrong, I agree with what you're saying in regards to economy. But the data show significantly higher death rates than flu and common cold, and that attitude makes everyone lax. If people would just wear a mask effectively, the problem is almost entirely solved

What people don't realize is that deaths are surpressed as long as hospital capacity is not overloaded. When that happens, deaths will increase substantially. Literally just wear a mask. Hospitalization is not very fun for these people, and its very costly
Interesting
AZ checking in, looking like March is when we can start buying, and we will need it if mango wins
All three appear to be postponing results until Friday.
BANNED ONE TOO MANY TIMES MODS ARE GAYER THAN FREDDIE MERCURY ON A FRIDAY IN 1979
Biden got Az and PA mail in ballots have barely been counted 88% dem leaning. This isn't over. Markets won't like that by morning
True, but Trump‚Äôs actions has made it easier for them. Alienation of our allies, putting tariffs on chinese exports so they have satellite countries ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù their products so they aren‚Äôt exported as chinese products. Vietnam was heavily anti-china, but since chinese exports have heavy tariffs, china will have their products 99% complete, ship them to vietnam to be finished, and then exported. Now vietnamese jobs rely on China, growing their influence. So many people don‚Äôt understand geopolitics and it will be the death of America as the lead superpower in the world.

Pollsters as about a good at election as I am at stonks. Pick the fastest pony and ignore everything else
can they just fucking call Florida already.
If not, I‚Äôll give her some stimulus package myself
wtf nevada forgot there was an election?
Whatever happens, it was already priced in
Same man same and tendies
bruh .... the most "reliable" news source

Fox News - Biden 218, Trump 148

Biden leads popular vote 

So fuk u morons
Media wanting to keep it close to maintain viewers.
You know numbers aren't final until at least Friday or even next week.
Its 2020.....watch it be a tie.

Wow this is all gonna come down to mail-in ballots in PA, NC,MI & WI
they have a strong heroin addict union there
Pa def could not have been called. They have counted zero mail in ballots
Nbcnews pretty fast in update. Let‚Äôs see
Boomer af, but I kind of like it. I'll scope out some Sht for mid December tmrw
damn i just wanted weed legalized :(
So many votes left brother. Have to wait for the mail in votes.
It's not. 300c EOY
The market has been a barometer of how likely Trump is to win for months now
How can you vote mcdnonald trump and not have small pp
Arizona makes the margin smaller, but still a Trump victory.
Are trolls trying to recreate the r/politics chaos in here? Jokes on you fucks it was already chaotic here
Hey stfu the man is tired and wants to go to sleep
My VXXX calls won't.
PA, WI
Donald Trump -200
Joe Biden +150
Exactly, they call AZ quick for Biden. However they won‚Äôt call TX for Trump. 

Wtf?
Actor from home alone 2
I'm in danger chuckles
Whats the payout gonna be
good point
69
Married too huh
I am not from US
That's because they're right. Many thousands of mail-in votes won't be counted until Friday probably.
Lmfao the comments üòÇ
Up until just a few minutes ago, trump has by far led with popular vote but lagged big time in electoral. The system is fucked no matter what side you are on

Donald Trump Live Betting odds -303

Implied probability 69.3%

Nice
Of estimated vote count. Estimates on total votes could be wrong, especially with how big of a shit show everything is right now. Way more mail-in ballots than ever.
*Looking at the Blue Wall, or it was a Blue Wall until 2016 when Trump smashed it*

Is Melania gonna let Donnie give her his stimulus package if he wins?
So... Buyden or Selltrump?
HOLY FUCKING NAS FUTURES!
Oh I'm sorry, who was the one who lead countless lawsuits on Trump?

Who was the one who focused their entire 4 years on impeaching trump?

All the media does is put this guy down. But you're making him stronger. Nothing can defeat him now.
They loved McCain so Trump self inflicted that pain there.
Let‚Äôs hope not.
When does the looting start I‚Äôm asking for a friend who wants a new Xbox and ps5
this is much closer than anyone anticipated, regardless of who you support. we wont be getting the winner tonight

Hope you got puts with AZ flipping blue
Fine, but don't Alabama my United States
Lol well I‚Äôm fucked with mine then
Well shit, now I don‚Äôt believe it üòÇ
good thing we don't count votes by feelings.
Holding out for the best. I feel like it‚Äôs ready to crumble. Volume was weak as hell today and it struggled. So hopefully it falls soon.
gotta hit the reddit libs with the lmaos

the media is just giving them false hope, TX, FL, PA, OH, AND MI could have been called an hour ago.

guess this is what happens when you call everyone who disagrees with you a nazi and/or racist lmao. thought ya'll learned in 2016!
Congrats to that guy that bet 5 million for trump to win. Mod him

Hopefully. But yuan is tanking rn so maybe notüò§

Oregon is pretty lenient on drug charges even before this. 1st time possession charges is a misdemeanor already (specific amount). I wasn‚Äôt aware that measure 110 was passed tho. Link?
If Biden loses its because of the riots
PA is counting into Friday and WI isn‚Äôt reporting everything until 5am tomorrow
Fox has it called but not MSNBC which  is interesting. But Fox hasn't called NM and MSNBC has

Huh, I know 3 people personally who tested positive, and two of them are dead, and the third was hospitalized for 2 weeks.

Weird, it's almost like anecdotes aren't representative of the whole sample or something.
Keep going. Texas ain't going to flip. But it might next time. The only way to not be a forgone conclusion is to keep it up.  Also fuck electoral system. Both sides hate that shit.
We won‚Äôt know for 10 days

Red sweep?
Puts on Nate Silver too
Thanks dawg. I got asthma but my bmi is like 23 so that seems to be a plus against this.

where do u guys check the polls result? all i seeing sleepy leading, why u guys keep saying orange winning?

I will never understand who decided this was a attack line. It's like trump trying to make fun of biden's hair. I mean yeah, he obviously had some transplants or something but you're in no position to talk.

I‚Äôm a virgin
Fuck
Will TSLA moon tomorrow on a mango man win?
Wonder if he‚Äôs still concerned about fraudulent mail in voting?  What a fucking ü§° President and weak-dick man...
?? No, not really? AZ gives him 11 EVs which means he would HAVE to pick up PA, MI, and WI to win which isn‚Äôt that easy
Dont worry you'll lose the rest before then
Always a good choice.
If I have to wait 2 weeks to know who wins imma be highly annoyed
He‚Äôs winning in states by so much more than he did against Hillary.
[deleted]
I like to imagine a scenario where she was the democratic candidate. She'd win by a comical margin. She doesn't want to give people free shit and she's pro school-choice so it would never happen, but I still like to think about it.
I'm gonna join your dog
Hell yea!! Trump 2020!!!

Common sense? In this sub?? MODS
[deleted]
Go laugh at R/politics they said 2020 can‚Äôt get any worse, once they load that gun it will
AZ going for Biden means 46 other electoral votes in play. PA, MI, WI. 

Unfortunately we won‚Äôt know who won on election night. But AZ going for Biden means 79-83% chance he wins even with Trump winning all the other sunbelt states tonight. 

Literally going to go down to PA, MI, and WI just for the lols. PA way too early to call especially with all the mail in votes.
2016 repeats itself, the democrats learned nothing haha
Half is wsb will reeeeeeee

holy fuck all the big battlegrounds look like a clean sweep for trump
**DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN.. ONE THING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON HERE IS WSBs MODS GAY**

50/50?  Don‚Äôt do drugs bro, it‚Äôll fry your brain then you start talkin‚Äô LikE tHat
This election is Crazy!
Yeah right when people started hyping up that odds were going in trumps favor. I just couldn‚Äôt find a way to bet besides my CGC calls
fox news
They‚Äôre all showing trump leading by 4 or more percent which is literally his states meaning he won already.
You really are clueless.
but im not that retarded only a little bit
Donald Trump -180
Joe Biden +135
Betting odds have it almost a toss up at this point. If trump would have picked off AZ it‚Äôd be an easy win
cringe
And beer
[deleted]
/r/politics says no one will win by today and Biden is statistically in the lead.

no one could answer who's leading in VA (?)
Nice. That means uber stays?
You guys got hit hard from the beginning and were good about wearing masks during protests.  There was quite a spike in many other stats in the weeks following the protests.  Yes the media blamed it on covid parties and other shit since they were the ones stirring up protests to being with.
AZ called for Biden. The Dems do alot better out west.
Keep ya butthole tight

C‚Äômon man
This race is gonna be tighter than gnat booty
Lot of whining about PA, but most of the big metro areas haven‚Äôt reported much.
Not having to pay for so many ads on Reddit that were obviously not effective lol.
No bad news is good news
we can only hope
Boys I might‚Äôve just made 100k from trump. Haven‚Äôt been watching what swing states he‚Äôs won but so far it sounds like all the ones I picked. So if he does win it‚Äôll be bitter sweet lol
PA 44% in, Donnie 54.5%, joe 43.6%
WI 53% in, 51-47
Only 3 states matter, PA, WI, MI. Whoever wins 2/3 will most likely win. Right now mango is winning in all 3
Surprised they didn‚Äôt burn down their polling stations in June
Idk if Jyna is included

I live in Wisconsin and there‚Äôs a ton of hicks, so def going trump
You‚Äôre retarded if you think Canada is a shithole. Top 5 country on the planet
Honk Kong is flat bc they know Daddy Trump gonna kick their ass for another 4 years
69 obv
Arizona hurts but def Trump‚Äôs race to lose now.
No PA is red if you look at votes so far Trump did better now than 2016.
If Biden wins after this shift of odds that‚Äôs legendary
Just like the betting companies, it does not matter who has a presence in NJ, the state will be flooded with weed soon.
But msnbc hasn‚Äôt yet. Weird!

There is nothing worse than the sinking pit of fear that forms in your soul when **WSB starts overwhelmingly hyping your plays**

WSB always calls the top on a play. Always.
Trump 270, Biden 268
Wisconsin has some good cheese
Watching news anchors speak on data and do mental math is fucking great
Lots of hopes last I checked
Bruh they have to actually count the votes first lmao no channel has called any of those states
4 MORE YEARS üï∫
I think a plummet tonight when all the futures traders go to bed and we‚Äôre still contested
I never said they did a good job copying him, I just want BABA to bounce back this week like TSLA does.
Let me know if you find the arbitrage
Update: Instead of Trump I said "I voted for Jo Jorgensen" and I'm already -30 in that comment.

Bruh you whack! Trump already won all the major states to seal it. They just aren‚Äôt added yet
FOX just called the election for Biden
It's not even real money it's that funny E money.

On a serious note. Trump wins let's say, which sectors/tickers are a buy and hold tomorrow into the Christmas rally? Currently holding a stupid amount of WORK calls/PLTR
I think you‚Äôre mistaken
Ok Im completely wrong on my DD just like stonks. ü•≠ did it again. All the pollsters should quit their job and become degenerates like us. Well they already are If they are biased and caught up in their liberal bubble. I dont care ü•≠ wins because its good for stonks but the whole world sees murica as a form of ü•≠  man now.

As ü•≠ once said he wont lose a single vote even if he shoots somebody. He is absolutely right. Also ü•≠ is a hard worker. He campaigned 30 times in PA just in the last few months. That will get you the votes. 

ü•≠ did it. Lets be happy for another 4 more bull years and more jobs.
God, I love seeing Nielsen tanking in the after hours. Pollsters are being proven to be big retards.
That‚Äôs what they said 4 years ago
The current vote is not an accurate representation of the whole. Trump looks to have locked down many key states, but didn't get the vote yet (it will come soon)
Do you only watch CNN? Lol
thank you
Donald Trump -180
Joe Biden +135
Would BABA participate in this Nasdaq rally?

Why?
KENOSHHHAAAA
We good. Arizona and NJ legal
As someone not from America I find it funny Biden wins pretty much every large city yet all the hick towns vote for Trump. Puts on US Education and America
Prop 22 is winning 61% vs. 39%
The apprentice dude
It's not worth shutting down the economy and ruining people's livelihoods over 200k deaths from a flu.  That's just a bad flu season.  Multiples more than that will die from second order effects of the economic shutdown.
Red states that are highly likely to remain red aren‚Äôt officially tallied yet

Yes but choosing which way the market will go is the gamble...

Not over at all. This goes into next week
Red Sweep.
We should thank our fake news media and anti national leftists
You smell like elderberries.
Isn‚Äôt nio gonna fall cuz trump & China relationship? Good luck retard
Idk where you can bet but I would‚Äôve placed a bet on Biden when Trump flipped the odds. This shit is going to Biden. Like someone said earlier, always inverse WSB.
Puts on firearm companies. Look back to post Election Day in 2016 with a surprise trump win.

I voted Gold
If it was Bernie, this would of been a different story
My 100 330 puts expiring this Friday need support
If trump wins I‚Äôm saying. CLZ0 future also up 2.58%
Yes ma‚Äôam. I mean sir. I mean ma‚Äôam.
I don‚Äôt think so, not until fuckin Pelosi gets arm wrestled by aoc
That seems silly because i know you're not arguing that the west coast is contested after all the crazy shit that went down this summer. 

Grab a drink. Cry less. Enjoy the pretty colors and the "experts."

I wonder if it's too late to FOMO into tech calls tomorrow.
penn still hasnt counted mail in votes along with michigan
I guess votes ?
He can bet on Nevada, Minnesota, Maine, and Hawaii which puts him around 229. He‚Äôd need any three of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. It‚Äôs not looking great for him.
is it just me or did trump pretty much clinch it at this point? biden looking to end up around 250 electoral votes total.

Tonight's futures have been more exciting than my sex life the past 6 months

Historically speaking this is a return to a previous world order. Not too surprising the world's largest and longest continuous empire is rising again.

Mail ins, fucking dipshit. Why do you think states haven‚Äôt been called
Stop celebrating. We wont know the results tonight.

Honestly Im trying to see if I can play both sides on different betting websites
Yea, bend down, I‚Äôll stimulate your anus
Idk what channel you‚Äôre looking at but trump won already. Texas Michigan Ohio and pa are enough for 270
Yup
This is objectively reasonable tbh
Just google hunter biden footjob or some shit lol
I have 362, wbu?
Best futures trading night of the year! Volatility is off the chain!

I‚Äôm new to this so this question is stupid but wouldn‚Äôt it be a good idea to invest heavily in options based on who you think is going to win because there is almost guaranteed to be large jumps/dips when the market opens tomorrow?

Well if youre going to say that, it's especially retarded to compare it to the common cold. The common cold doesnt usually warrant worrying about infectivity and spread. Under 45 age group definitely looks ok in the short term (no idea on long term effects) but when they spread it, it's pretty dangerous.

C'mon, man. I know we're on WSB, but dont do a disservice to something thats actually dangerous to a significant portion of our population. It's bad to spread misinformation, even to other retards.

Funny how quick you were to respond to this but not my other comment. And if you won‚Äôt provide your insight then I won‚Äôt change my opinion. Thus the divide between college-educated liberals and rural conservatives widens.
So bullish, like a rock baby!
That needs to be done federally
Trump isn‚Äôt able to contest pa
So guys... any news on stimulus?
Gonna take back the country from these idiot doctors.  /s
You do realize sleepy joe can‚Äôt put together a sentence
How? What states does he win where Trump is currently ahead? Feel like he needs NC
are you retarded
No, he‚Äôs a big trump fan.
Are... You trolling?
Yeah thats not coming with much certainty tonight. But its looking like itll lean rep.
Trump winning
Bruh literally every channel has one dude controlling the large tv screen like he‚Äôs Vanna White
John King sound BIG nervous
You‚Äôre always welcome here. Our Democrats love guns, our crime is through the roof if you live in the hood, and the food is fuckin top notch. This is the Land of Ma√±ana.

I look a lot like Ricky, and I tweeted at him once. He retweeted and I got a TON of Canadian Trailer Park Girls DMing me.
check again retard
Nvm then.
Lol for real
He can count on Nevada, Maine, Hawaii, and Minnesota so he‚Äôd need any three of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Not looking great for him.
As long as their not 11/4 you‚Äôll be fine
Yes
Nice
NC mostly go in trumps pocket. PA is the last hope for Biden.
Suckin votes away
Ill do it
Ahh that makes sense
Realized how retarded this sounds. Patients test themselves in the drive thru. I just put them in the fridge. Not horking these people's noses with a fake mask.
Shithole country
I don't understand
Yuppppp
The people have spoken, and they've said "we're fucking retarded"
Already banned with two posts in high negatives. I could use some love
Same. My puts are going to 0.
because it becomes more contested not because he picked up votes.
What‚Äôs the most likely way Biden wins?

How likely is that?
How's Jorgensen doing tonight?
##market finally starting to realize
Yo this is fucking close as FUCK

biden might squeeze it out honestly
Ugh, fine... I‚Äôll bite. Who the fuck is this Trump guy?
13% gap...

They die
Democrats are in the delusion phase right now
Biden claimed AZ.
Barely any of the dem counties reporting even a third of the votes yet.
he didn't have enough space on two monitors
Not a liberal, but what the fuck are you talking about

Then when you scroll down the reporting figures you go like wtf how is mango looking like he's gonna win the rest.

Electoral college and vote gap based on remaining reporting votes.

Trump winning with a projected 10% chance is the reason why we have gain porn posts on the stupidest fucking positions.
Numbers don‚Äôt look good for Biden there. Let‚Äôs see Pennsylvania
Networks are working overtime to show every possible way Biden can still win. 

I honestly don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore who wins. But I can see how republicans can get pissed at the media.
Thanks homie üòö
Can someone smarter than me tell me why Florida hasn‚Äôt been called even though the margin is less than the remaining sample?
Oh he's definitely not. The Trump vote is an FU to the absolute insanity and corruption of the DNC (and old guard RNC).
china is on an upwards trajectory since a few centuries now. dont know how you want to change that short of a war. its more about making small changes around technology and competition.
Don‚Äôt California my United States!
chinavirus giftwrapped the election to dems and they still couldnt win

fucking retards

they should all be fired permanently
If Trump gets the states leaning in his favor he will win. The 209 Biden has are states that were called early on.
No clue. Could plummet at anytime if they announce no winner tonight or could remain constant
Congress has enough lawyers already.  Not that many football coaches.  It's all about diversity.
Probably a better place than most of reddit. Much better than r/politics
trumpers will say those are the rules and always have been so deal with it can't be that bad

But do you really want a system that leaves literally the majority of the country feeling like they get fucked every time? Aren't effective political systems ones that keep most people happy with the system
Won‚Äôt be me, i‚Äôm straight chillin until that old dementiated fuck tries to come take our guns :)

Put on an FB call spread on the close. Fingers crossed
Too late bud. Should have bought today.
well consensus seems like it will be too close to call tonight, how would market react to this uncertainty?
Too late retard. Don‚Äôt chase
Because the areas that have reported are those that lean more dem but Trump is predicted to win much more of the rest as they are heavily republican and more numerous.
North carolina and pennsylvania. Whoever takes those will win imo
Nominate anybody except a walking corpse
Classy. And very demo of you. Bravo.
Come on Trump pull this through!!!! This race is far from over.

The hard data shows CFR's less than the common cold for people under 45-ish, actually.  Higher for old farts. Maybe you should read the data.
Right. Which are based on what bets are being placed against the house.
No, you're an idiot if you think that. You are literally voting for people who want to give you less money if you have less than 10 million and vote republican
"Biden will probably win the popular vote but it doesn't mean you're president". This is one of the biggest flaws in our system
The keys are Arizona, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. If they split those, look out.
But losing in states he needs to win

11pm: spy is up because trump is going to win!
nah CCP is big boy
Oh calls gonna print tomorrow. That‚Äôs for sure!
F

They got my ass earlier too. -100 in a minute
Dude no one wants to call Florida until 99% after 2000
Now this is what I like to see
You can‚Äôt see the PA and WI mail in and early votes that could swing it
Check back on this one
4 more years of that ugly, stupid motherfucker lol. Oh well
Huh, I saw a bunch who tested positive and would have died if not in the ICU. Maybe look up some hard data before comparing it to the common cold?
Says the guy asking for what calls to seriously buy tomorrow...
Is it because it's too close to call it? Why are blue states being counted so much faster?

Hahahahaha yes but they also sway so your bookie can balance their lines. So if a ton of new bets come in on one side they crank up the payout fir the other side to incentive people and balance their book

It‚Äôs just people voting with their money
What bullshit you looking at
Truer words have never been typed on reddit before
it‚Äôs been blue homie
I heard Wendy's is doing well, might be hiring.
Next idea for the Dems. Maybe nominate a cute puppy for the next Presidential election. A golden doodle, or a Pomeranian. I think that will get more votes next time
bought spy puts at close today AND  bet $300 on biden, so u know.. i'm doing great!
[deleted]
Mail in ballots not counted til Friday and we know lots of Dems are voting at home. I'm buying OTM puts on Friday. Calls on VIX when Trump calls out the mail-in ballots are rigged.
Ur looking for r/politics
Fucking right! Boutta quit my job
Butthurt redneck piece of shit
So why the fuck do they call blue states right away? They gave sleepy joe the whole west coast .0004 seconds after it opened but STILL won‚Äôt give trump states he‚Äôs obviously going to win?
The state isnt being called tonight
don‚Äôt really care either way as long as my calls print
reaction was what we saw today. People don‚Äôt realize that they didn‚Äôt drop 8 percent consistently between 2 days lmfao
Brainbow Sherbert orange man
I just realized I‚Äôm hanging out with teenagers not even old enough to vote.
So what? What are you thinking?
If republicans bar a Supreme Court nominee for an election year, would they do the same if it‚Äôs in their favor?? Oh wait...
Not a single tweet from ü•≠ in over 5 hours. Setting all kinds of records tonight
Wait for the Vix to go to normal levels so you don‚Äôt overpay for options

American's once again tell the coastal elites who control the media that they don't pick the president. The people do.
Fair and equal, like the liberals want.
They already said on CNN PA hasn‚Äôt counted mail in votes yet and they tend to sway blue and WI isn‚Äôt reporting everything until 5am.. it could be a toss up but if Biden gets those two it may be over
JPM just raised the price target on this to $200.
Yeah "projecting" is about right lmfao
This is what ABC said. Metro DC apparently takes significantly longer to count than rural counties.
A vote for Biden is a vote for weird child sniffing videos on YouTube.
You talk about food a lot in that comment hahah

Supreme leader Trump, take my energy!
Lol even Augury covered them
Biden campaign should post loss porn of money spent on useless campaign tomorrow
Is it too late to buy calls?
You know what color they like
Yeaaaaa hahaha....mine are 11/13 as well and they are already deep itm. So fingers crossed I dont get completely fucked
Alabama electing a college football coach over a lawyer with an actual platform is the most Alabama shit I can think of
I posted in a r/politics megathread that I voted for Trump and got downvoted to oblivion within a minute
LMAO
Yea that is interesting. Maybe like they "called" California , Washington , Oregon just after their polls closed without actually counting. That's what happened to Virginia
[deleted]
if you think you lost money because she held money up and not the republicans youre a complete cuck
I dont know man, you guys definitely appear to have euroboners which defaults to communism for me.  America has negative cultural affinity to Europe... always seems like you guys feel like we are a failed european state....   trump is shit, collectivism is worse than trump.

Yeah it's been known that they wouldn't start until the polls closed. Them and a bunch of other states. That's why in all reality this race is wide open
Why do you hate freedom?
Just Russians trying to sell the narrative that Trump is good for the market
People who think polls are sure outcomes are the same who lose their money to posts on Stocktwits

Same. Still a sliver hope remains
Must shed blood to rise up.
I thought so too, but maybe the whole downturn was trying to price in a win for him, and now that he might lose the market is going back up to where it was before. I dunno. There's no understanding this shit right now.

Yup nicely said, this is going to come down to the wire.
Downvoting instead of being able to provide an answer. So unsurprising. The truth is that uneducated, blue collar workers aren‚Äôt knowledgable enough to understand how Trump‚Äôs policies hurt them despite how much he lied to them.

Leaps on spy for next 4 years is easy money, trump pump my portfolio to tendie heaven
A sad day for democracy
Oh it's real. It's just slightly more dangerous than a common cold. I know 3 people personally who tested positive and didn't feel a thing.
AZ might go blue but aside from that yeah
Biden is winning so far, and the mail in ballots haven't even been counted yet. Looks very bad for Trump
[deleted]
Halloween is over don‚Äôt be so spooky
These fuckers are showing every single outcome desperately of how Joe can win with their little map. Barely talking about Trump at all and his outcome. It's obnoxious.

Judging by most of the comments, the Biden crime family
So, left for college at 15 with 80k supposedly instead of 18. Yeah, big bullshit lmao. No way you made 80k in a year or so through tutoring+investing. Shit I while I wouldn't believe it either way I'd give it the *slimmest* odds

>I already posted some of my lower 7 figure trades. 

Yet you've conveniently 'deleted' them lmao.

>You realize software engineers fool around reddit and other things 50% of the time while working?

Most software engineers don't make 7 figures. Shit most entry levels don't even make 6.

Also you're missing my point. If you're supposedly that filthy rich there's no way in shit you'd waste your time on wsb.
I don‚Äôt see how Michi goes back to blue at this moment.

The sad part is Texas where there was a real chance of it going blue and it‚Äôs 500k votes red RN
You said they're all communists you dork.  One is a socialist and the other two totally establishment.  The far left doesn't like either of them.

honest question,  why Mango?
Biden lead Texas...and Florida....
God I hope so

It was explained to me in another comment that the urban counties haven‚Äôt reported yet and they lean very blue. So unless the urban counties buck the trend of voting Dem, there‚Äôs more than enough votes to overcome the deficit comfortably. 

Not my comment, just relaying what I was told.

Think about it this way... Some dickhead calls you from a random number. 


First, you have to answer a call from a random number

Then they say do you have 20 minutes to answer some dumbass questions? 

Then you have to not tell them to fuck off and /or eat shit

Then you have to actually answer their questions truthfully. 

You have to be full retard to participate in a poll.

No you didnt. Stop karma whoring here.
Even if biden eeks out the win by slim margins here in the next few days

he will not have a mandate

dems will not be able to push for the radical reforms they talked about
Looking like VIX will fall to 29 tomorrow
Guaranteed that won't be the case as it'll still print $$$ whether you believe it to have a real impact or not
I think it‚Äôs just general sentiment honestly otherwise who fucking knows anymore
I love it
Go back to your shed and eat avocado toast for dinner.
Yes ‚Äúofficially‚Äù but anyone with any sensibility to count knows it‚Äôs Trumps.
Because Trump = stonk goes up and also less capital gains tax

Yea dude, red october was pricing in for a biden win
Literally the perfect situation for bookies, decent odds on both sides for possibly multiple days
Pretty sure because it's only 60 percent reporting and it's most of the big cities still to come in. Still seems early
Wait wasn‚Äôt wall street for Biden?
can‚Äôt wait to see everybody on Instagram crying about trump winning üò©üòÇ mother fuckers voted for Clinton and Biden at least this man told Iran we‚Äôll blow them to bits if they want action
If Trumps win the popular vote, but loses the electoral college, will Democrats including Nanci, dead Ginsberg, etc listen to their own advice and abolish the electoral college?üßê

Yea there is still like 10 red states finishing the count, should put him around 300. There is only like 3 blue states left to add votes
People are so stupid in here. This is going to be contested because of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If those flip blue its going to be right down to the wire. People are celebrating way too prematurely.
[removed]
Nice
They haven‚Äôt but OH and PA vote counting so far shows Trump is doing better now than in 2016 in counties that were counted so no chance Biden can pull a comeback. Michigan is hard because Detroit hasn‚Äôt been counted.
because the votes remaining heavily favor Biden.
It's because of the counties left.

It's gonna be close and the states aren't being called tonight. VIX popping off tomorrow, boys

What platform?
So my uvxy calls have a chance?
Gay
Swing states trump leading by 500k votes. Without 4 of them Biden cannot hit 270
Commie state or hunter?
How does the electoral votes count work? It's showing 209 vs 112 in favor of Biden. Are a bunch of red states not being counted yet?
Guess it's bedtime then
It looks like this will be a contested presidency that may head into the courts.  If the Senate remains republican, then it looks like we won't see a stimulus bill for a while?  Don't get why the markets are up.  + rising covid cases and europe in lockdown.
PA and WI will go to Biden. Postal votes will get it over the line.

Whew that was one tough bear market guys.  Strap in for SPY 500 by 2022 and don't buy puts unless they're on SQQQ.
I‚Äôm not sure Biden could say the same though. Sure he had a scandal but it didn‚Äôt get the same air time or steam behind it. Which is why I say this is more surprising for me than 2016
Pretty much. I'm only slightly more liberal but this shit is mentally exhausting. I don't even use any other subreddit because of all the Trump posts and comments it ruins like 1/3 posts.

Gotcha yea I just double checked. Looks like tromp won p
Giving me hope

I expect my vision to become true. Trump is going to win tonight, Biden is going to win on the 12th. I had a vision about this around a month ago. I posted it on one of the subreddits.
OH, PA, and MI haven‚Äôt reported that much yet have they?  Anyone reputable outlets projecting Trump wins in those states?  Doesn‚Äôt he need to win them all?
gg brotha
God I hope so
Aye
Watching CNN right now is like watching a üåà üêª try to convince you their puts are going to print tomorrow when futures are up 3%

Trump train
Dumbass
lmfao honestly, 98% of votes counted in FL, he‚Äôs got a 400k lead and CNN still wont call it? meanwhile, CA appears on the screen and is automatically clutched by Sleepy Joe.
Something about a red mirage
Fox already called it
Apparently 400k votes with 2% left to count is relatively close
Bolt Up brother
He already did
Florida is Trump - he also has a big lead in GA
\-295
Stockholm syndrome at this point
Biden wipes back to front
If they tie 269 269, can they run as Co-Presidents and we have a reality show following them around all the time?
Congrats on the sex.
Thanks bro
You kidding or just slow?
So your argument now is that Trump is better for stocks not because of longer term S&P 500 performance but because while the market was closed Trump is performing better than expected? You really do belong here.
So? They didn't call a fuck ton of states trump will obviously win.

I'm saying he can't get 40 more electoral votes.... It's 118 now for Trump.

And no, I didn't vote for Trump, I'm looking at the map and doing the math. Just my thought, I'd rather make the right prediction, and that's my prediction.

Make yours, how many votes does Biden get? What states swing his way as the path to victory?
Riots are bullish
Updated betting odds?
[deleted]
Omg due to the ant ipo announcement that we say td in our market. That‚Äôs their correction
Can we finally kick Nancy out after this?
Yes. Priced in.
That was last week
You‚Äôre a conspiracy guy, come on now.
Cause Trump. We making money tomorrow
Northern Virginia isn't counted yet and is blue af
That will be a war
I‚Äôm retarded and bad with words but when the market was tanking, it was pricing in a Biden victory. Now that brumpft basically won we can move on and start the next 4 year bull market
I sell premium. Don‚Äôt care which way any of this goes. Plenty of long leaning strangles, I‚Äôm doing great. Doesn‚Äôt change anything I‚Äôve said.
Will be ironic af if Biden wins the EC but loses the popular vote haha
Left leaning media
China has strengthened while Trump has been president.
-295
MSM: ‚ÄúYes Trump is leading. But let‚Äôs just assume that every vote that‚Äôs yet to be counted will be for Biden‚Äù
Biden has to win two out of PA, MI, WI which I don't think is happening... 4 more years of donnie tweets coming at ya

Right.  That‚Äôs not my question.  Any wrinkly-brained retards wanna give it a shot?
Can someone explain why Virginia is shown as a win for Biden yet trump has 52 vs 46 percent Biden
A lot of great state parks. I saw a squirrel once
Nah just confused. Somebody else told me some key states are not counted yet
I voted for Biden but now I want mango to take it lol
I thought it would be a biden blowout....looks like it‚Äôll come down to the wire
this is so tight
I had no idea trading view had a graph of this, so cool!
Bruh I'm a democrat and know we are the best at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Its embarrassing
they (CNN) don't want to lose the ratings - they want ppl to think there is still a chance
What has Biden lost that they were counting on?...  especially if he wins Arizona.  How are you saying it‚Äôs not gonna happen?
Ya didn‚Äôt understand this either. Guess they are just projecting Biden will end up taking the lead?
No I think there is a greater implication to it..

I just wanted ye to win
Yeah looks like Trump won. Don‚Äôt have any positions but fuck
Because China and Donnie don‚Äôt get along
Just Philly lmao. Like why is that so hard?
It depends on state laws
Non Americans are having a tough time to understand the elections. A few friends did not believe me when I said Trump has won already practically speaking.
:(
I usually hate it when people say proved in to everything, but I‚Äôll agree with this one
This is far from over, way too many trump supporters celebrating.

I don‚Äôt think they know what a swing state is. There is a difference between a swing state and a state that could potentially flip.
That's not really how it works. It's not a sport. No one is winning until it's over and someone has won.

Yes, you can even wait until tomorrow
is a nice place, good beers
What are Trump's bovada odds now?
As long as it helps my calls idgaf
If you are looking at asian markets that is in response to ant announcement today. Tomorrow MIGHT be different.
No he has basically won it he is up in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and NC
It ain‚Äôt over until the BBW sings!
It's quite a reliable blue state so easier to call early
so do wildfires but ....
It‚Äôs over. Accept the Don won. Guh.
Florida is 98% counted just call it lol
Soo it comes down to Pennsylvanian Georgia and Florida üòê
Its recovering. DXY falling. Was down like 5% at one point
election thread is dead.
And then moon some more
the common man in America reads at an 8th grade level
Man I hate Trump but nights like this remind me why I hate democrats so goddamn much.  Bunch of idiots.

Maybe telling everybody you are going to ruin the economy is a bad strategy or something
What‚Äôs so hard to understand?? Biden is the worst candidate in US history.
Lol I never said you said Biden was a good pick. Whose the biggest idiot is the issue. Biden is.
Please direct me to any updated site where he's not leading in VA
Yeah. I would love to be wrong on this one.
left media already reeeeeing on trump, so predictable
Aren‚Äôt trading hours closed?  How does a halt happen
just shut up man hahahahahahaa
If Joe doesn't win them it's over
Ah yes, I also dwell in the past.
You won‚Äôt have a penny left
Because.....???????
No. Markets rally because it's pricing into the end of this shit show!
Chinese currency is tanking, they are predicting Trump win - what does this mean for markets and stocks?
[deleted]
They are way behind sadly. Last I checked something like 40%. Michigan official said it could take up to 80 hours
They just called the entire west coast Blue. The map still looks like 2016ish.
stock market is pricing in trumps win idiot
Hedge most likely
We might not even know the real winner until the weekend. This week gonna be wild
Inferno!
Neither, literally a 50/50
A news agency can call a race if they want. Doesn't make them right. They're holding out on Florida and Texas which is 67 votes alone. The rest that are polling having in Trump's favor put him at almost 300 total votes.
They starting to like it I bet
Of course the algos know it's Trump 2020
Well, polls are closed so that‚Äôs moot.
They can‚Äôt speak it into existence so whatever.
Dude its your fault for not knowing risk management and acting like a retard. Anyway, if your wife kicks you out, this is your new home.
Jesus why are futures up so much rn
It ain‚Äôt over until the BBW sings!
I do. Which is why I have been dedicating my life to Wheel it. I found the light.
sure it will buddy
My lord, jeezus. Jump fucking shitballs. They are interviewing some idiot alone in a room and she is wearing a fucking mask. Democrats are fuck-ing re-tar-ded.
It will print BIGLY
My pre erection poll results were always big red
My candidate is not going to win. I‚Äôll be making a lot of money tomorrow. Feeling pretty lousy all things considered.
Yup. Assuming he loses Arizona, he still needs to win one of Michigan, Wisconsin, or Minnesota (in addition to pa, ohio, nc, ga, etc) to win
Even though trump is way closer to winning than he was against Billary. Smh
Biden lost
Just gonna have to happen the old fashioned way, Elon will make clean energy cheaper eventually
[deleted]
They are FAR more important to everyone's day to day life but so few realize it. States still have a large say in politics compared to federal but the presidential election is so much more attractive, so people focus on that
If every other state can count there mail ins before why can't Pennsylvania?  Smells like bullshit.
Don‚Äôt think the markets are gonna like it for a Trump victory
why TF is Virginia called blue? at least wait to have a blue lead with 60% votes lmao
Are you surprised? Most of this sub is actually retarded lol.
‚ÄúBiden with now a large lead‚Äù with them auto giving him CA but won‚Äôt call TX/FL lmao!
Good one
They‚Äôre all fucking horrible is my point lol..
Why ?
A few weeks of burning businesses and looting, then BLM returns to it's 4 year hibernation in Nancy's nightstand.
Trump
"Assuming Biden turns thing around and wins Virginia, assuming Biden wins PA...."
ESCALERA OOOOHHH
Ohio and Texas will be called soon
Lol these fucking pre election polls are garbage
TACTICAL CASH GANG DEPLOYMENT INBOUND
Donnie won. If Biden wins every blue state left he still don‚Äôt have 270, the red states Donnie has support in will put him near 300
Thank you
Oh no doubt if Trump wins PA its over but I don't think it's there yet since they are counting mail in ballots tomorrow at the earliest
I‚Äôm honesty not understanding how Trump is still the betting favorite.  It seems like he has the more difficult path to victory still.  What am I missing?
Trump leading by 500k votes in all swing states totaling over 270 lmao it‚Äôs so over
Damn and I really though California was getting sick of the dems
If it was super close that would be the case, but we can be pretty confident of the winner ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äù
Exactly, all ya got is cheese and bank fraud
CNN loving the phrase ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs still early on‚Äù
Imagine putting up a male Hillary and expect the result to be different this time, Dems learnt nothing from last loss.
sell at open on the off chance there's massive profit taking...
[deleted]
Fuck Trump and his bitches
Because in those states the deadline was met and mail in ballots are counted. DUH
if its 50/50 you should go make some bets because the lines are far from 5050
Why?
BLM is a bullshit agenda hidden behind a purposeful mask
it's Trump right now
The karma has really gone up tonight
whichever way tonight swings i think we can all agree, i ain‚Äôt never seen 2 pretty best friends it‚Äôs always one of them gotta be ugly
Russian troll
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the other way around
That‚Äôs what mango wants you to think. Mail in will sway it

How is CNN still trying to piece together a Biden win?!? They‚Äôve been doing this for like the past hour already. This guys right arm has got to be on fire right now from all the pointing and waving.
THIS IS MY FIGHT SONG 

BLOW OUT MY ASS SONG

AND I DON'T REALLY CARE IF MY ASSHOLE BLEEEEEEEEEEDS
You can't go full retard with tqqq. It's the safest investment. If you don't understand that you're actually fuckin retarded.
Trump
They‚Äôre raising taxes from 4.95 to 5.95 if it doesn‚Äôt pass. Unless you‚Äôre making over 200k, there was no reason to not vote for it.
You can tell who is over 18 and voted or has a functioning brain by comments saying this is over or trump is going to win the popular vote
Same here. Hopefully they can be considered us tech for a day. Unless something happened has Jack Ma been sent to the gulag yet?
once again, cnn wants u to know "we have a long way to go"
Many states already counted the mail in ballots. That‚Äôs why Biden took leads in some states right after polls closed and ended up losing that lead
No chance of that
Trump
[deleted]
Pollsters are absolute trash
Michigan is allowing same day registration and voting?

Does that mean if I am out of state student attending U of Michigan, i can register and vote?
In the end, we only care about money
Lol no it‚Äôs not
Just wait until the magical mail in ballots get counted...
Betting odds are betting odds
well, i think VIX will spike if i‚Äôm right so
We should do a race to see who gets kicked out faster
Clinton probably would have won if not for the very well timed email scandal. That swayed alot of ppl I think
That‚Äôs an error
Noted. 285c for December

CNN is so sad. They‚Äôre counting NE-1
I honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking at. Can someone just outright tell me who‚Äôs actually winning at the moment?
Yeah I‚Äôll pile on, why?
If apple hits 225 I will be soo happy
Someone tell me my 11/4 SPY 334p will print!
Conspiracy üôÑ
We calling some of these states yet?
There‚Äôs really grown men in here begging for attention the same way 14-year-old boys do
All I see is a sea of red
Man, I hope you're right on that. One of the staff on Crowder's show has predicted MI for Biden, I can see some merit in that.

Like I said, fingers crossed if suburbs turn PA, MI and WI for Joe.
Wasn't PA the last to call last election too? Whats up with that state

And AZ leaning blue rn is making this race tight af
Whose winning ?
[deleted]
Use white background and save some ink geez. Guy with the chart is the actual retard
Because he's not leading dumbass
Its still too early to tell whos gonna win you turbo autists
Is this the greatest moment of 2020?
That's gonna be my strategy for life.
Friday minimum they keep saying
Will we know Michigan and Wisconsin tonight? That might be our only chance of knowing soon
Not including pa Michigan which is another what 40 or so
I went bigly on spy like a retard. Should‚Äôve gone straight tqqq
I could honestly care less but when have you retards ever seen a president have retards fully decked out in political gear of course DONNIE was going to win... lmao üòÜ
True autism. They just dumped the obvious WC states into Biden's tally because voting closed. It was always going to happen.

People who said this wasn't 50/50 should be.
80 million California‚Äôs gonna vote all for Biden and it won‚Äôt mean shit
Betting markets are 70-30 Trumps favor. There wouldn‚Äôt be uncertainty of who the winner is. Delay may be? Sure. But winner will be 95% confirmed tonight it looks like?
Who called Virginia for Biden?
Futures > Porn > Election Results
Lol Trump doesn‚Äôt like big tech
FACTS
What percent of cali is counted
PA wont be in play if he takes NC along with the ones I aforementioned.It‚Äôs over.
[deleted]
The key swing states with a shit of electoral votes looks to be going towards Trump. The current count was expected. However, after the swing states report, Trump looks to have a healthy lead.
Why is VA still blue when Trump is leading?
And r/conspiracy
It ain't over till the fat mango yells
My NIO will be so red tomorrow:(
Breh if it goes down just buy more.
So essentially the pump the past month was due to a Biden victory priced in is what you're getting at?

Jesus that‚Äôs a stretch. I‚Äôm assuming 125? Even then, I hope spread that off
Assblasted lmfao
Lose weed?
Biden and Clinton are nothing like Sanders dude lol...
He can't just tank the market lmao he doesn't just have a switch he flips that makes it go up or down

&#x200B;

Edit: oh wait yeah he does it's called twitter
Honestly kinda more interested in state and local props at this point.
He has half the electoral votes right now. Wont win california. Pretty sure donny only gets 4 years.

Edit: maybe spoke too soon. Hes down, but most of the remaining states are likely to go to him.
Why?
You‚Äôre an idiot if you think he‚Äôs not going to win PA lol
FL is already counted i believe
[deleted]
Cnn didn't call it
My guy it is what it is. You want to fight over Alabama and those fly over state? Damn shut up
Wrong arrow bud
if the algos pick up the headlines, were good. Not as good as a blue win, but meh
I thought once you go gay you don't come back?
Districts drawn like that on purpose
they need to decide how many to manufacture
They didn't count fl, ga and tx yet
It looks like Mango will even win the popular vote! This is hilarious!
Who tf said Texas was a swing state lmao
[deleted]
Gotta think Yang would have taken him to the mat
Huh? No. Trump has the momentum but FL, OH and TX are 29 + 38 + 18 and he has to get to 270. With Fox right now that gets him to 233. NC and GA get him to 266.
Republicans won‚Äôt go after anti-trust issues I assume
It‚Äôs not counting Florida Ohio pa and texas which is like literally 125 points
people blowing their load way too early, mail in ballots will be mostly blue bc covid fears

&#x200B;

Idk how these people are calling anything either way rn
Okay mango supporters, just because I didn‚Äôt vote for your orange emperor, doesn‚Äôt mean I want communism...
CNN: ‚Äúif we use a traditional map‚Äù lmao talk about WORRIED
Never have traded futures. I am well versed (lol) in options so can I just buy a futures bull call spread and it's conceptually the same as an option spread? Like all I can lose is the debit right?  Really itching to get in some action rn
Vaccine and stim gonna pass lightning quickly after election üòÇüòÇ
..... dude do u even know how this works? Biden has +400 odds rn go bet on him if u want
#Tonight is proof that most people secretly hated BLM.
So it looks competitive
Y'all some fucking retards if you think this is anywhere to close to being a lock for trump. It's still 50/50
repubs and dems can both agreee that pollsters should be beaten in the streets
If California flips I‚Äôll take a 1 year ban
Glad that I went full retard buying TQQQs.
Turns out reddit was right: the market tanking in September and October was pricing in a Biden victory. Yesterday and today was pricing in a trump victory.

Republicans don‚Äôt regulate anything except abortion and gays

I need Trump to win so my PLTR investment moons.
Counting is not the fucking hard - report the numbers
Lol they did that for votes, once they get elected they'll forget about it.
Why do you say so?
They just called it on fox
I just wanted that sweet energy initiative, fuck everything else
It‚Äôs not looking good for Biden....
For every seat you give to someone else because of race you denied another the seat because they were the wrong race.
All other subreddits are for group think
If you look at a map with district voting results and ignore state borders almost the entire country, geographically speaking, is voting Trump.

Cities need to pay attention and liberals need to get off their high horses and out of their little bubbles. There's a reason Trump is rolling so hard right now and it's not racism.
You think they'll still both be alive in 4.5 years?  They old as fuck
A show of respect to the putholders from last week
Those are itm dude
Let me tell you about a little stock called GME, an epic short squeeze and did I mention Michael furry invested in it?
My favourite part was making NKLA the monkeys
You're delusional if you think he's winning PA, they even stopped counting tonight and they're the deciding vote.
Virginia, already called for Biden.

Only 60% of votes counted and Trump leading by 150k votes....

Also MSM: ‚ÄúBiden wins DC 92.6% to 5.9% that went to Trump‚Äù.

Compare DC voting stats to the rest of the country and it‚Äôs obvious DC is a swamp.
Red still means less regulation in general, which is good for megacaps
CGC as well!!

Yup, only place where you won‚Äôt get downvoted into oblivion for being pro Trump/Biden.
This one is green.
Hey, you can hate on Trump but it looks like he is going to take this. I didn't vote for him twice and I'm willing to be able to say that.

I have bullish positions. So I'm happy.
Everyone said Texas was a swing state. I kept saying hell nah. Bet y‚Äôall feel stupid now.

Our constitution won‚Äôt let us be racists is a more fitting title
why is Nasdaq futures mooning, considering Trump wins and republicans are after tech companies lol
The issue you will see is if we get a red majority across the congress as well...The consolidation of power will force Tech to bend at the knee, which doesn't bode well for them...
They wont have new skits if Biden wins
shit youre right hes getting crushed in those states
Bullish moon
Would trigger an automatic recount
Are you retarded? Lol
Good bot
Looks like the fair tax won‚Äôt be passing. Pritzker is tucked
Thanks for the in-depth analysis.

Personally I think if Biden holds AZ strongly like it appears to be, that shows his strength in the suburbs like that has been showing all night. 

PA, MI, and WI are ~~easily~~ are more likely going to Biden if that trend holds.

Election will come down to PA Mail in ballots which will take 1-2 days of counting.   Shit can still go wild.
I was making more of a jab at NBC and CNBC saying ‚ÄúToo close to call‚Äù and ‚Äútoo early to call‚Äù nearly every other sentence....

It‚Äôs Biden leading 209-112 run but ok

Sorry, wrong. Kanyes got this in the bag
just be put buyer lol you can win in any market
I‚Äôm a dem and it seems Trump will win, unfortunately. We have to accept, adapt, and move on. I guess the consolation is that the market will reacted favorably to him wining and I‚Äôll get paid.
Fox just called it
what's up with AZ?
It WILL be different tomorrow!
CHRIS WALLACE DID A 'GUH' when fox called Florida for Trump. Turn the volume up and listen.. THIS IS SO AWESOME!! All the crying, whining, fake nees, BANNING US.... THIS IS SO... SO... SWEET.

Realistically, I would close all bullish plays tomorrow if this tech trend continues. At this point Trump looks to be firmly in the lead, but on the off chance Biden takes it with delayed ballots, this could come crashing down again. Play logically, not emotionally

Nancy Live on ABC
You can't go by votes alone.  You have to consider the counties like you said.  They still need to count the tip of VA, which is where a gigantic population is that is Democrat.  VA is blue.  It's not in doubt.  VA is like 90% Trump land if you're only looking at area, but the vast majority of the population in VA actually lives in Northern Virginia and are democrat. It's extremely densely populated in NoVa.

This would be the most likely scenario to trigger widescale violence by militias and anti-fascists
CA called for Biden probably
They‚Äôre not calling most of the states where Trump is leading
Same question
But Virginia is blue, trump won the popular vote, I'm sad about it.

If Biden wins AZ: he has a 83% of winning. If Biden wins Nebraska 2nd as well, 93%. If Biden loses Nebraska 2nd, 76%.

Yet.
Well some trump supporters really are racist but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the majority. I think a majority just got screwed over by Obamacare because companies started cutting back, now Biden wants to introduce more radical taxes. So most I‚Äôve talked to just like his policies a lot more.
Wait if trump wins and the republicans hold the senate but the dems hold the house, aren‚Äôt we back to ‚ÄúSTIM TALKS GOING WELL‚Äù?

What do you think will happen when Trump wins and the GOP still in control of the senate and now less incentive for stimulus?  LOL, this market is creating the biggest bull trap in history.

All that's left for PA is to figure out what the margin is.
Trump is carrying states he won last time with smaller margins so if that carries on he will lose the WI MI PA trio and Biden wins
They just don‚Äôt want to

Nope, a data driven observation. I was actively reading conservative news media in 2015 and 2016 to see what the other side was thinking. Based on that I predicted right wing and centrist vote going to Trump, and I was right.

In 2020, my hopes for Dems reduced even more based on -

1. Their response to the protests and riotings after George Floyd, especially in fiercely liberal cities.
2. Their very reverse take on COVID-19 handling, it seems right-leaning and centrist Americans didn't like that.
3. Biden-Harris positions on fracking, court packing, illegal immigration. None of those were gonna fly well.

For Pence, his shining moment was his VP debate, and if anything right voters will and probably did see him as a strong potential presidential candidate.

Was not expecting things to look this good for Trump.

I voted for Biden. But if it wasn't for that stupid measure in california making it legal to discriminate against whites and asians, I probably wouldn't have voted. I wanted Mayor Pete on the ticket.

So eh.

edit: I wonder if Trump will go nuclear on fake news if he wins. Polls being wrong twice in a row is almost impossible and will be super easy to paint as a conspiracy.
Source? I‚Äôve watched his odds go from -400 to -300
You‚Äôre honestly probably fucked

I voted for Biden but I‚Äôm projecting a Trump win, sadly
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/11/03/election-ballot-delays-usps/

the coronavirus, trump‚Äôs own focus on election fraud, and the funding cuts to usps have set the stage for trump to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the election from an in person standpoint and refuse to acknowledge the mail ins (which likely favor Biden). The loss of hundreds of thousands of mail ballots does not surprise me. Going to get wild.

Plenty to see tonight still...but I think trump declares a victory and tries to stop the counting of mailed votes.

kamala was a horrible choice. Biden is a moderate and he chose a far left person in kamala. That was a huge turn off to all moderates.

Trump has it in the bag. If Trump can win twice that should be a wake up call to the folks asleep behind the wheel at the Democratic Party.

All we need now is Trump getting a clear and decisive victory, 305+ votes, 1.5 million popular votes and the SPY hits 350 EOW

I'm gonna set that ask higher asf tomorrow.
Currently, Trump is at 108. I am expecting FL, TX, GA, NC, OH, PA, MI, WI, UT, ID and AK to go Red. That's 175 votes, so 283.

If Montana and Iowa flip, that's 9 votes, and with Iowa looks rural Iowa votes are coming in slowly towards Red.

If AZ flips, add another 11 to get 303.

Biden is guaranteed CA,OR, WA and HI, that's 78 to the current tally of 131, bringing him to 209. If he holds to MT, MN, wins NV and AZ, that's 20 votes to him. NH and ME are 8 more total, so  241 total. If he wants to win, he must, must flip PA and WI. I don't see that happening.

Edit \[08:04 PM PST\] : AP just gave CA, OR, WA and NH to Joe, taking it to 209 as I predicted. Montana turned Red, and just a matter of time before Iowa does the same.

Calling FL and NC to Trump any moment from now.  


Edit \[01:48AM PST\] - WI just flipped blue, if it remains so then Biden has a shot, all boils down to counting in MI and/or GA. If not then more tense hours ahead.

Sir this is Wall Street bets...
Could you imagine the numbers Trump would pull if it wasn‚Äôt for the whole COVID debacle?!
there is a chance biden wins if he gets PA, but PA won't be done reporting for days.
[removed]
That's the wheat belt & they already counted.
Lol that‚Äôs not it
Totally agree... BLM movement actually  helped Trump so much
Doesn't look like a landslide in either direction.
tulsi, yes. kamala? not for me
Hell yea hahahhaa
You trusted them after ‚Äò16?
Halted 40 minutes ago from a huge short squeeze after the tide changed. We slowly coming back down to earth now
Trump win or one night with Natalie Portman?

 Which one?
They will not.
So far the best market indicators have been

1. Orange man tweets
2. Inverse WSB
3. Drawing gay lines on charts

can't go tits up
Fuck you and I will see you tomorrow.
Red wave incoming.
Someone tell me what happens to my stonks tomorrow
So looks like Trump will get the mostly expected must wins Florida and Ohio.

North Carolina is surprisingly close.
Then please enlighten me on what they want, and how Trump has fulfilled that.
Old white man brutally humiliates other old white man. There, you heard it here first, go to sleep.

How does that affect markets?
Damn take me back to March volatility baby
Her race has nothing to do with it. She's a shitty person simple as that.

Why the fuck do so many people like to race bait everything? I know a ton of black folks and Latinos voting Trump bc they're absolutely fucking sick of race being thrown into everything.
MT looks like it'll flip
Republicans have rigged the system so dems need a 60-40 majority to flip the senate

Electoral college favors repubs so much

But we should go to the special politics sub for tonight
Trump -240/+180 Biden

They've moved Biden closer twice in the past 10 minutes.

Remember folks: These are moved to promote even betting. The house always wins.
We‚Äôre all just NPC‚Äôs inside Mango‚Äôs VR game.
Mail-in ballots can be sent in as late as today, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there was plenty that got mailed out just yesterday or today
Fuk,  I‚Äôm heading over to /r/politics to find out who‚Äôs winning
I actually kinda liked yang. He had some interesting ideas.
Your not understanding that what they are seeing rn is what we saw today in our market for them.
At least you didn‚Äôt have DAL puts
Trump with 295.   
Thats my current prediction.
im hoping to get maybe half of my money back on 11/13 spy puts
It‚Äôs trump lol
Omfg my portfolio is going to moon tmrw
Don‚Äôt worry any sane person would go crazy in that echo chamber
It's full of retarded white people. Same as Minnesota.
I‚Äôve been doing this too hahahah
Get some sleep and stop looking at futures
Susan Collins dominating. GG Senate Dems
Just buy calls and use 5% of your profits to pay for a therapist to complain to about it

 Must of said something that isn't 10000% left.  Can't even be in the center of the political spectrum or even be associated with the libertarian/independent party over there.
Thank god reliable DD has been restored to the sub. I‚Äôve been lost without lizards and dogs showing me the way.
Tulsi would have walked away with it so easily tbh
Can't argue with that
what‚Äôs the point of r/politics if all of them are one-sided? You literally get downvoted for being on the opposing end
Not in WA, MI, PA

ah that retarted strength.I think it will be also up :/
Man can‚Äôt imagine how much money could‚Äôve been made on futures trading. Oh well
A vote cast at 10 am is reported the same as a vote cast at 5 pm. I‚Äôd argue early voting on a Saturday is more indiciative if someone that has to work on a fuckin Tuesday.
just her. she's a very unlikable person in general. she seems fake asf
So... real question here. I‚Äôm apolitical. I‚Äôm just moving around the sun and observing. How many of you have zero feels about life like me? What‚Äôs any of it matter in 1000 years? 

Sorry, took a deep hit.

Bruh you are in sick state of denial, can you please look at the map again?
Please learn English
Uh, no, it's brigading because you guys are clearly brigading. Everyone keeps posting here telling people to go over there and see how many downvotes they can get.

That's pretty much the epitome of a brigade.
It means that Irish fuck gets 7mil
Sorry you have puts
How do you think this will affect NIO?
Trump up 3.2 mill on the popular vote lol
Dumping them at open tomorrow
Think CCL will be among the mooners with this? They did kind of shoot themselves in the foot over the weekend, but that might have been partly for show since Biden was favored to win.
Wtf is happening with nasdaq.

Are they not calling florida yet cause west coast polls still open?
Will the left learn that calling half the country irredeemable racists and the only path to tolerance is submission to another race, is a bad election strategy?
Yeah, some places in PA don't even start counting the mail-in ballots until 7:00 AM tomorrow. Crazy.
On a serious note, buy GLW

Hand out rope at r/politics
If I could trade futures I‚Äôd be wiped out by now
I'm from a portland oregon our liberal leaders are so fucking beta its insane.  They let a tiny ass group of 200 people be the voice for everyone and run around trashing everything its so embarrassing. Then DA basically won't charge them with anything. I wouldn't be surprised if the moderates got fed up of this shit and voted Trump. Then all our rural counties are trumpy and oregon flipped.  I'm sure it won't happen but it be hilarious if it did.
I‚Äôm holding 10 100c for EOY. And I‚Äôm not fucking selling until Apple hits 120

All this futures pumping; when all this is over and the market remembers that absolutely nothing has changed, the drop is going to be SO FUCKING BAD!
That's just because sqqq stopped trading- no one can short until the morning.
Stimulus talks going VERY well
Wsb sentiment says trump? Means Biden is gonna win it. Always inverse.
Maybe 435
Careful now...pitchforks might come out any time.
Honestly kinda shocked how crazy this seems to be in Big Don‚Äôs favor, feel like the Dems just had to show up and again even with way more voters it doesn‚Äôt work. Crazy stuff.
still a long night + mail in votes

edit: but lol

this is going to crumble when everyone realizes we aren't getting a winner tonight

You mean after ‚Äúvotes‚Äù are ‚Äúfound‚Äù
i really think kamala was an anchor for sleepy's campaign. if u recall, she was the 1st or 2nd democratic candidate to bow out of primary. she's completely unlikable and arrogant. i absolutely loved tulsi destroying her in the debates.
I don‚Äôt give DD often so listen up. if Trump wins here buy MSFT ASAP at open. Riots/looting/civil unrest will mean a lot of Windows need to be replaced and who sells Windows, Bill Motherfucking Microsoft
Damn just got banned from r/politics
Damn drink some chamomile brother
He was on stage endorsing trump last night historians will credit him with the election victory
Wait there up on hopes for a clear winner we will see what happens threw out the night

Watch them bring out Tim Kaine
Bear Lives Matter
Whether Trump can run again or not is a moot point. Look at the influence he's had on so many people. It's something I highly doubted would happen but the normalization of this far right and alt right ideology isn't going away for a long time
Nasdaq got that hulk boner
Trump = pro keep economy open
Biden = pro be a pussy

Easy pick.
Calls on safe spaces and cry rooms
The Silent Majority
What are they now?
Well, that's your mistake.
Members of r/politics are so woke
I literally cannot understand how even with Donnie's mishandling of the pandemic the democrats couldn't figure out how to put forth a candidate to beat him. 

  
My calls are happy but my brain trembles.
Shit u got the ‚Äòrona?üò∑
Errr... Who exactly is predicted to win?

Edit. No politics I gotcha. :)
Some states counted early before and some just started today.
He pissed them off with the tariffs
Breaking: CNN now projecting Biden to win FL if he gets 107% of the remaining uncounted ballots.
Don't celebrate yet. Who knows? Maybe we see an uno reverse card.
Upper middle class (100-250k) seemed to think Biden will increase their taxes and voted for Trump as per polls.
^^^^HERE  ^^^^HIDING
Haha I literally have been saying that for an hr
Everyone gets a 4 for 4
I sold $500 calls, I swear if it makes me lose on that
Would you hold aapl calls or sell in the morning? 11/13
Ahh, cool. thanks for clearing it up, thanks bro. Futes don't lie. Also, the yuan is tanking which supports a mango win.
Looks like we‚Äôre fucked mate
Hey hey hey. That does NOT help my confirmation bias
And here i am, forgot to buy my puts
This shits got me more stressed than trading stocks
In many states the early votes were counted and reported when the polls closed...
Trump is a bully. Can't win even handed.
Sir this is a trap like no other

It‚Äôs not over yet, at all. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania determine everything
All they need is good leader. Someone like Obama. Hilary cunning, Biden too old
Biden is getting absolutely slaughtered. This is gonna be worse than 2016.
No sir. Lots of happy Canadians out this way.
Lol. Move em by their pussy
Holy shit Georgia and Pennsylvania(philly) stopped counting we are going to fucking go crazy tomorrow üëÄ
I honestly don't know why everyone is acting like Biden has already lost. It's literally anyone's game right now.
\*call. I did have two until I wanted to minimize my risk today. I'll take your blessings. <3

Her record is terrible.

I think her background is quite inspiring though she made it from nothing and I respect that.

Some states report delayed ballots sent by mail, e.g. Utah gives estimate of arriving between Nov 10 to Nov 17. Stocks should stay flat for now.

There was no huge orders in NQ, most probably algos just playing the news.
Bears, good news we hit circuit breakers. Not in the way ya'll were expecting though.
You will split your differential and tip the fuck over my friend.

I really don't think this is true. I think it's more mixed than people think. Not saying it will sway results though. That I don't think.

I think this magical flip flop people think will happen is ridiculous
Anyone know why tf is Iowa a blue state??? 

You‚Äôd think corn country is Trump country
Feels like we got some /politics people here on downvoting streak ü§£ we are here to make money you people
Maybe because she was rated more liberal then Bernie Sanders when comparing voting records
This is gonna be the inverse of March or April isn‚Äôt it.. so we come full circle 

We go and limit up now just to wake up to -3%
JOJO
She seemed too far left for many independent voters.
If this shit reverses so many bulls gonna $ROPE
No
People are worrying too much. Trump did better than most thought but it was still going to be Trump jumping out to an early lead because of Republicans vote in person more than Dems.

Give this a few days for things to become clear after mail in ballots are tallied.
She slept her way to top.
Vixy
He should really stop trying to project elections based on faulty poll data.  It was way off in 2016.  It's way off in 2020.
lol someone in r/politics just now ‚Äúguys I‚Äôm beginning to think those polls for Biden might have been inflated‚Äù
Imagine thinking that participating on the default politics subreddit and getting banned for saying something remotely negative about Biden and subsequently banned is considered brigading.  

Reddit desperately needs to fix that sub.
I will never trust any of those polls ever again.
Yea
Half cyborg half god. We are on to our 5th planet.
What ‚Äúit‚Äù are you watching!?  Look at Texas, Florida, Georgia, etc.
Probably true for most of us here
PayPal yeah
agree but im sad i pussied out today because of election now i hope i can get in before all the action.
Made her bones lying on her back.
If trump could win the electoral vote by 30-100 votes, Florida gop by 3-4% (I think or maybe I chose 2-3% lol can‚Äôt check bc predictit is down) and just a Trump victory, I‚Äôd be a happy guy with a 4x return
She‚Äôs a hypocrite. She‚Äôs going for the black vote but as a prosecutor in CA she put a ton of black men behind bars for drug offenses.

Middle class

Pick one
She‚Äôs smug and laughs when she can‚Äôt answer something
Biden brings in regulation and uncertainty.  The oil industry and the ability for the America markets to prosper have only be able to do so well because of the Trump administration‚Äôs ability to deregulate the EPA, make great trade deals in the best interest of American Companies and out the American markets first. 

This is why we have seen the markets soar.  Biden and Nancy Pelosi have called for the repeal of all the work the Trump Administration has done.  Biden and his son have uncertainty with China and or Russia.  More uncertainty for the markets.
Didn't have a choice after she told me her kid was an autist.

What calls to buy at open seriously tryna make atleast 100% on a day trade
I'm less sure about it being a toss up, but if the mail-in votes change it to biden after a day or two, then that's likely the situation for the most outrage with how trump set the stage.

It's not like nq will never be below 11,400 again.  We will sell off end of week.  I'd get really bullish though middle of next week when things have settled down

Betting on a trump win was much easier than the stock market
Damn we really getting 4 more years huh
Think if trump wins hes gonna be gracious toward biden during his speech? My bet is HELL FUCKING NO lol. Hes probably gonna rub it all over his faceüòÇ
People who voted trump obvisouly voted after 5 o'clock because they fucking work at jobs
Bovada
Someone explain to the retard (me) why VA is called for Biden even though barely over 50% votes and Trump leading largely?

yes its real
I'm just here for the free shit
link, I want to watch that guy break the fuck down tonight
They‚Äôre big mad
Contestion isnt off the board. Democrats said they will contest no matter what. They will claim mail in ballots
they counted the early ballots first in most states
That a real thing?
Crazy Nancy via Antifa
I hope so. I sold a fuckton of puts when the $18p were $5 each (for like 2022 or some shit).
SOMEONE TALK ABOUT VIRGINIA!!!

HOW TF IS IT CALLED FOR BIDEN???
My ICLN calls are fucked. Glad I picked up RTX leaps
reeeeee
Ayo Kanye taking the lead in Texas
Few more days of posts like this and I'll buy high
There is still plenty of opportunity for things to get fucky.
We get it, you have puts
They are deserving of a lot of blame themselves
Guys I am literally shaking and I'm so scared someone feed me tendies and tell me mango man will go away
guy on rogan said, "still think biden has a 65% chance to win"
DXY and stonks up at the same time

they're not dumb. they know and do it anyway. so what they are is a very specific and special kind of stupid, on a level lower than even the dank degenerates here.

They just called it. Trump wins
Not even mad about taking max loss on my credit spreads according to futures
We don‚Äôt even have the Rust Belt 3 numbers yet bc they‚Äôre too stupid to count.
Started several hours ago and it'll still be going long in to the night.

We're all getting shitfaced tonight.
NBC ad: I‚Äôm so ready to go to work 

Me: you are so not ready to go to work
Remember guys, you shouldn't care who wins. You're here to make money no matter what. Just use whatever happens to your advantage. Be a player, not a pawn. You got this üëç
Yep. What a moron. But he was probably told to say that by his socialist handlers.
Pelosi or the squad
i only got a 12 minute time out
something something choking
Yang gang
Pennsylvania Chads
Wait what‚Äôs going on in Virginia
No.
Jorgenson
Probably higher after trump wins
Would buy if profits were to be used on yolo calls
Yeah pretty much. I viewed Trump contesting as a nonfactor since he could whine all he wants it wouldn't change anything.

Now I legitimately want to know where these Trump votes are coming from. Market goes up because apparently him contesting was a risk.

But this is worse.

If it's up tomorrow I'm going with the dog and buying more calls on leveraged inverse products, expecting it to reverse mid day. Keep in mind when he won it opened down a ton and rallied.
I understand that reddit in general is a left leaning community, but r/politics is a whole nother level of bias.

How the fk did I managed to get banned from r/politics . Bunch of vaginas.
Oh right, I don't trade futures. But there is a futures market for trading those. So anyone who has an account there can trade em.
So who blows the horn to signal the rioting to start
i‚Äôm so far left i can‚Äôt fucking wait


haha, die neolibs die
Ditto, and these calls ain‚Äôt cheap!
Mail in ballot printer go brrrrrrrrr
For real.  DNC will blame Trump for not being fair or something.   The Democrats just fucking suck.
With the election being decided I would expect 5-10% up

Best stock to dump life savings into in my opinion
Trump got TX and FL...
Good time to buy next few days?
Really feels like this is it
If Biden somehow comes back to win futures will flip back to the Dow.
Lol, yeah I show it was called for Biden. 56% reporting with Trump up 52-46
You sure it was 50k? I saw 2 people that bet he'd get 5% of the pop vote, that's it tho
Didn't we already knows most votes today will be red votes until they go though the 90m early ballots? These results are skewed today.
I agree, I don‚Äôt see how either side can be confident rn
a gei bear detected, hope you get a green dildo in 3 hours more.
Haha no u are fucked at open. They will be worthless
Dum dum Democrats thought that if everyone voted they‚Äôd vote for Biden.
Hope y‚Äôall and your 401ks enjoyed being the strongest country on earth
They'll be ok but worthless
Gets the people going
I bought both
TRUM-BULL county

You love to see those fucks in shambles
Man I sold 5k worth of 345 calls at 4:12.  I regret it a little bit now, will regret it a lot if I wake up and levels have held.

U god damn right
John King going harder than Johnny Sins atm, no time to take a breath
No one tell him ü§´
Insane how Trump has built a cult behind him. Ngl its super fucking impressive.
McConnell doesn't have to do anything once the election is over with.  Trump really doesn't either.  He says he wanted a big stimulus, but you never know if he just said that to get elected. He could actually turn into a fiscal conservative President in his 2nd term. You never know when there's no re-election to play for.
Or Elon Musk
Holy shit riots are going to be insane this entire week
I can‚Äôt wait to see what excuse libby fake news media is gonna say about this blowout
I love capitalism. Wall Street loves capitalism. Nasdaq loves capitalism, straight bull loves capitalism.

What happened when no capital gain tax remains no capital gain tax?

Capitalism Baybee.

My calls Baybee.
4 more years of calls
‚ÄúWe are gonna make them pay!‚Äù
shouldnt have paid those bills to gamble I guess lmao but no good on you.
So how are the futures trending up? Who can trade?
The lucky few.
Ehhh this is still a tossup imo. Milwaukee, Detroit, Philly all way behind on counting. All three under 30% reported. AZ going well for biden. This is a coin flip right now in my mind
[deleted]
Stonks always go up
Yep
Same
[deleted]
Don't interrupt them!
The night isn't over, several states are within 100k votes. It could still be contested.
Well should be pretty easy to beat Trump in 2024
So basically stock market is back on easy mode, weekly yolo spy calls and we will be straight
If ur up by 4% in FL, you've won it. Thats a blowout
üöó
People who don‚Äôt understand probability, yet again
[deleted]
yeah, but trump can‚Äôt run again so

and i still think he will lose the popular vote


trust me, there is a huge amount of people still not voting
[deleted]
We retarded enough to try to buy calls at open?

[deleted]
Lol I never said Biden was a good pick, the way you think I'm for him just cause I oppose Trump is exactly the problem with today's political landscape. Cause of people like you it became party over country. They're both idiots that shouldn't be President
 Give them nothing, but take from them, everything!
So would tsla get fked too?
Lol yep

WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK CHINESE STOCKS ARE AUTO FUCKED IF TRUMP WINS?!?!

He says all this shit about China. Yes. But why would he delist or somehow screw all these publicly traded companies? At most he will sanction political figures from there. Da fuq does nio and jack ma have to do w anything.
Hop on the trump train ya dems, chu chu üöÇ mfkrs

Can anyone find the link to the retard who bet 1K$ on Kanye West receiving 50k votes for √† 50:1 ratio?

Acting like Biden is 100% in the early vote
Fuck I got downvoted so much on Politics it doesn't let me post more then once without a 20min lockout. Bundle of sticks subreddit.
Dude, if the dems lose this year after the US response to covid 19, then the party doesn't deserve to exist any longer, much less win an election
All it needs is a little push over the edge
Then I will be REALY REALY full of tendies
Even Trump stated that at his rally. 

Said, "They had some real killers on that stage and they went with Biden. I don't understand it."
Ah ok, so what day do you project? 11/10? or sooner
I wish... But only during market hours for options, and a little before and after market hours if you want to buy stocks, hope it doesn't spike too much pre-market so we can grab some more!
It just went down for 3 weeks in a row
Yea China is gonna get their ass ripped for 4 more beers
No. Correction still coming. Sell covered calls.
That, thank you.
no? everything still ticking
Stock market looking good though
These dumb CNN anchors still did not get the pattern. If trump is ahead in early counting he will definitely win that state, if he‚Äôs behind he may win that state in the end and that‚Äôs obviously because they start by counting mail-ins
[deleted]
LOL
God bless
Start printing ballots
So we arent getting a winner tonight are we? Maybe I can reinstate my bovada account tommorrow
Rahm be crackin' jokes all night
I see, that's probably why futes are up. But I'm looking at the electoral count and Biden is up big and we haven't even seen the east coast yet and Cali has like 55 votes. So Biden should win big right? or am I retarded?
TIK TOK TALKS GOING WELL?

Is it done and dusted? Is there a surprise in store tonight?
Black Friday came early this year

Wait, is this bad for the BABA dip I bought? üòÇ
Anyone else go cash gang before the election and starting to regret it?
CNN - Biden needs to find 400,000 votes and mount a comeback in Florida.. after 95% of vote is counted.. come on now this is just sad
Sold so many amzn puts spreads. Fixing to be rich tomorrow.

It's not a wave, he's eke-ing it out in a few important states.

Futures are always here to give a true unbiased opinion of projected outcomes
Donnie earlier today said he had an acceptance speech and concession speech prepared

He also said ‚Äúhopefully I don‚Äôt have to give both‚Äù

Seems to be foreshadowing a ‚Äúwin‚Äù with in person polls only but a loss when all mail in votes are tallied
That‚Äôs just it... they won‚Äôt

Still counting votes for Texas. True cnn meme status right there

Biden finally posted a spanish tweet. An hour ago. Literally after most polls closed. Advantage - orange.
"THE MAIL IN BALLOTS"

"OUR ECONOMY HAS NEVER BEEN GOOD" 

Fuck this guy
CNN coverage is horrible - I need better data
He‚Äôd do that even if there was a landslide against him
Bro they halted everything
Because Trump looks to be winning by a bigger margin than in 2016. 

Also more minorities are voting for Trump than in 2016
Good thing Biden won Arizona. Hahaha fking retards.
[deleted]
Thats why you buy 11/6 puts when everything starts becoming more contested and questioned over the next couple days
Any of them
Haha, I do have some amd calls too, I couldn't resist buying after it dipped so much. Too many people waiting for the post-election pullback, so of course its gonna happen before.
[deleted]
538 would be wrong if they said he had a 0% change of winning. You sure you know how percentages work?
What do I look like, not a retard?
My conversion back to bull gang is complete.

I‚Äôd pay for that onlyfans

Will write in candidates count towards overall votes for Kanye West? He isn't in the ballot in some states
no, i‚Äôm not an accelerationist


but, biden was hardly progress is all
Final Predictions -   


Lower bound of 283 for Trump, middle of 292 if Montana and Iowa flip, high of 303 if AZ flips.  


If I am right, then two things -   


1) Never trust polls.  


2) We might see another Republican president in 2024 i.e Pence. The current wave of Trump voters will absolutely want Pence as president, probably even anti-Trump republicans will do the same. There's a decent chance that the US might not see a Democrat president till 2032, if Trump pulls a victory tonight.
Gotta build suspense
1) Trump wins election night

2) Leftists Riot

3) Democrats contest the election

4) Mainstream media calls Trump a dictator

5) Dark winter

6) Stonks go up???
man imagine the legendary memes that will be created
I saw this... don't know what it means but somebody seems very optimistic lol

CNN doesn't call races. They use an independent agency to count votes and call races. It's the same one that everyone uses, except for fox news (who has their own)
I suspected the green, but my balls weren‚Äôt big enough to bet on it.  Thank fuck I‚Äôm not holding puts.
Potentially. Still easily could flip. 65,000 votes and multiple solid blue counties haven‚Äôt finished their tallies.
Leaps. Before it hits 50. Hold while it goes TSLA style next year
so my 336$ put on SPY isn‚Äôt bringing me my tendies? welp time to wake up tomorrow to be down a hefty chunk of change
SPY 362c 11/4 printing?
LOL show me the crying snowflakes like they did in 2016
This sub will go bankrupt if that happens.
Roasted bbq chicken with 5 cheese blend and fried mushrooms and onions
Keep in mind rural areas cover lots of ground and are always red.  But not a lot of population.  For example in Illinois Chicago votes blue, the rest of the state votes red, and we are a strong blue state.

Yes. It‚Äôs obvious
Why does it matter? Trump won, it's done
Some of the big spike for NIO is due to Biden/Harris saying they will invest/lean laws to benefit clean energy companies. It's gonna have a quick dip if Trump wins.

It means trump has more of a chance then it seemed originally and futures are banking on that
Imagine setting up your portfolio so that only a major catastrophe will make it print
That's what you get for listening to a bunch of 24 year-olds who work the counter at Enterprise

They had to halt Nasdaq Futures? Damn you, who puts CBs when futes are mooning!
God damn trump is going to win tonight huh.  I don't even watch the media and still got bamboozled into this stupidity. Rip my uvxy calls. And rip me for saying my nio calls
Can't believe CNN isn't calling some of these clear red states. It's pretty unreal how bias they are, they literally are the fake news meme
SPY leaps at open
Not gonna lie I‚Äôm a little tired of it. Wanted new creativity from late night shows

BLM'ers don't move markets.  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares about covid either.  What they do care about is low corporate taxes, deregulation, and free money.

Could be a curve ball
Noon question.. is it possible to do off market trades? How?
If you trades futures yes. We tanked like 5% and then we‚Äôre green by open. Maybe green by 10 am but it was definitely a head fake
Where are the blacks voting for T? Source?
Till we speak out on FB, Twitter, Reddit or Snapchat or in public. Then get attacked....

#WSB Election Poll

Alright boys, time to gauge the collective wisdom of WSB. As usual, this will be a great indicator of what to expect in the market for the coming months.

[Who did you vote for?](https://fast-poll.com/poll/3e2fc4bc)

Place your bets! Cheers boys üçª

UPDATE: 260 votes are in, Biden still leading the WSB poll with 45% vs Trump at 38%. Votes still coming in. We need 500 WSB electoral votes to call the race. 500th vote get the award!ü•á
The fact that market is mooning right now means MM confident of a uncontested victory

Trueee
Baba cause it'll open deep red
Biden hasn‚Äôt lost seems like they‚Äôre counting large cities last.
Where are y'all getting your info? Where do I go to see the truth? All TV is saying Biden win. Are you checking Vegas odds?
4 more years of hilarious meme material from mango
Fuuuuck my VXX calls are not looking good, honestly I deserve this for betting against America.  GG bulls
OMG can you imagine Trump in a lame duck presidency?? The volatility is going to be epic
where those tards saying LiMiT DoWN hahaha

Lol mango supporters are anything but silent tho lol
Dems got rug pulled
Trump already won it‚Äôs over
Guys AMZN only made 100 billion dollars in 1 quarter! Tech bubble!!!

So whats in your shopping cart boys? Which tickers?
I don‚Äôt even want to open the app üòÇ my account will probably be down like 80% üíÄ
I'd honestly be surprised if he lived another 4 years lol. Puts on Trump's arteries.
Trump winning will create a lot of volatility not to mention riots, also covid will run rampant, but stonks only go up so
Lol
Everything. Four year golden bull run incoming.
Trump might actually have a shot at winning the popular vote too

Everything will be stupid up. Market got exactly what it wanted
All uncertainty is gone? Wtf
Green futes bloody open?
Cresco Labs and Green Thumb are poised for some solid growth in their upcoming earnings from IL
He needs to win Pennsylvania and Michigan. Dunno how that's looking.
Dems already talking about how we have to wait for all votes to count and it will take days to know the results

Sounds like loser talk to me
Could be. But Biden helped with NAFTA that helped China‚Äôs economy bigly
The stock market is literally all that matters. If S&P500 is positive on the year that determines your winner
Biden closing in now?
Hi, am I in 2016?
U think they're fucked?
I bought $40k worth of shares last week.
he has a chance, PA OH MN VA undecided plus tons of mail in votes
The dip was last week while waiting for the shipping results
Where
When was the last time you saw 3% futures that didn‚Äôt mean anything?
Nasdaq triggered green circuit breaker
He says in all caps in bold
Look up Biden's mistakes. There are many video compilations.

He even said "together we will defeat biden" WHO the FUCK makes that kind of a mistake?
When‚Äôs power hour boys?
I wish man but fuck I messed up on my puts lol
[Canadian WSB users rn](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/031/003/cover3.jpg)
If Biden gets AZ and eeks out NC, he‚Äôs won.
we're getting the sherk dildo aren't we
Hell yea,  hire the hooker for an hour  and get 58 mins worth of photo edits out of it.
‚Äò22 NIO C‚Äôs lol
What? I saw payouts that were $300 return for every $100 for him and like $50 for every every $100 for biden
Who the fuck cares we want money not to argue over the decisions of 70 year old men
ROCKET SHIP CHINESE
as a leftist, i see this as getting progress in 4 years rather than potentially 8
My calls like this.
lol the real DD was in the daily sub today when someone posted their mom asked how to short.
Healthcare and public college are like 7-3 issues. 

They are popular ideas.

Good luck boys.
there is a slim, but nonzero chance this ends at a 269-269 tie, and I cant think of anything that would get vxx harder
I just want my calls to print sleepy joe or dump trump
Np man
Puts on Tech at open if this 350+ point rally holds.  Russell 2k is only up 0.84.   Lot of profit taking at open I think
Can't wait for the casual racism towards hispanics if Trump pulls this off with their help üòÇ
Futures halted limit up lmao
K then go bet on biden
As usual the media was wrong! So many Latinos and African Americans voted Trump! You‚Äôll never hear about it in the media though.
Your one tech pickup at opening tomorrow : go....
Cenk having a meltdown
My icln calls are gonna drill tomorrow but probably worth it
Brehhhhh
You are the problem
What did you think circuit breaker‚Äôs were
You can 5x your money in the betting markets rn if you think Biden will win.
DUDE. THIS IS THE SUB FOR AUTISTS. GET IT RIGHT
And it was in that night that the longest and strongest bull run ever started
[deleted]
RIP my NIO call

I got SPY call to hedge at least
r/politics in giga shambles
No joke
House Democrats going to demand a 3T bill. Trump will agree. McConnell will have to bend the knee. In retaliation, House Republicans will go after big tech.
# SILENT MAJORITY YOU MOTHERFUCKERS
North carolina and Georgia are closer than they thought. If biden wins one that drops odds significantly 

Az is heavy biden too which is good

Wisconsin michigan PA will be huge
Normally I‚Äôd be considering $ROPE when I‚Äôm facing losing my entire account but honestly whatever. I‚Äôve just gotten used to this hollow feeling. Hitting the bottle hard asf tomorrow and playing a round of golf
I had a call haha fuck me
Look at SEDG, tanked 100 dollars within a few weeks after a run up the past few months like no other. Beat earnings too, just didn‚Äôt meet quota and tanked.
It speaks to the incompetence of the DNC that they fumbled what should be the easiest election beat ever. There were a million avenues to win this and they blew it
Betting odds are the best indicator imo
If trump wins is it gonna kill BABA even more??
2020 has been such a shitty year.  And democrats couldn't convince people to fire the boss.  Lol
He was -750, no clue. Maybe people liked the +350 Biden had
Omg we get to see a JPOW + Pumperino dance for 4 more years??? Ahhhh
What calls at open will continue to moon? If trump wins .... I feel like any tech will be fat money rn
Trump will declare victory before midnight imo
Arizona? Also WI, MI and PA not done yet.
Is he though? looks like he's gonna lose Arizona.
And I think to myselfffff

What a wonderful worldddd
I sold half that already printed, and I picked companies that had relatively high short floats. We‚Äôll see if they squeeze tomorrow
You're probably right but fuck them
Cnn onslaught of trump projections 5 back to back
Like they‚Äôd end if he lost?
[deleted]
Im going to run for president and call trump a commy
SEDG tanking today was a clear sign
EPD is my biggest position.  Plus a 10% yield.
LET'S START A HYPE TRAIN. REPEAT AFTER ME. TRUMP 2020! TRUMP 2020!
At this rate bears will be eating ice cubes from toilet water
Wow!
Might sound dumb but is Disney or draft kings ‚Äútech‚Äù bc I have puts on them. I also have an Apple call so maybe that could out way those
AND NO MORE STUPUD FUCKING LOCKDOWNS
Yeah, whoever owns the farm. But not the workers. Also Trump‚Äôs trade war with china fucked over a lot of farmers. But people would rather be angry against their own countryfolk than admit they were wrong about the president they supported.
Hahahahaha who?????
LOL this is HILARIOUS
whats tsla opening at
Dems in shambles?
[deleted]
Yes
Are they pumping because they think Trump is gonna win?
I need biden to win so my renewable energy calls hit!!!
Literally everyone I know is shorting and I‚Äôm sure most of this sub is. gonna cause the biggest short squeeze we‚Äôve seen in years
Like ded ded?
I fucking lovveeeeee itttttt

Not really. Just used the interactive map
Sounds like you're going to give him a little more then information
Make my account great again please üò≠ü§£üëçüèª
Even Vegas gives trump the lead now
Anyone calling it for either candidate at this point is an idiot.
I voted for that cuck twice motherfricker
Don‚Äôt worry. Knowing Apple, shits gonna be red. And I‚Äôm holding Apple calls. lol
imagine still thinking the stock market represents the economy after the last 8 months...
It still goes up. Will take longer to get where it‚Äôs going but the end result stays the same
So does this mean stimulus check? Lol
The DNC is the failure. They choose Biden as their champion.
Didn‚Äôt know futures could get halted. Da fuq
Good plan but I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if solar isn‚Äôt down too much tomorrow. Solar isn‚Äôt up just because people were expecting a Biden victory
Donnie u r a genius
[deleted]
Because I can tell by the look on the talking heads faces at CNN that Trump is going to win.
Looks like ü•≠ squeeze is coming on those numbers!
The race isn‚Äôt even close Biden is gettin smashed. I should‚Äôve went all in on calls
I don‚Äôt like him but I‚Äôm ok with Mango winning. He can‚Äôt get re-elected so he won‚Äôt care about anything, and neither should we. Sounds great tbh.
I went for a run for an hour, left the TV on, and it was like they were at a funeral when I came back.

Wow my leaps. 360 and 300 on you know what.

Wow
I have 100 Aapl shares!!  And sold a 114 CC üòî I‚Äôll still make money..but prob could have made more
Wow, they halted Nasdaq futures?!?
I wasn‚Äôt around 4 years ago. Was it good?
-270/+200 now
Post your positions, bitch
Watching Biden is like watching Ali in the 30 for 30 Muhammad and Larry, someone should have stopped him from doing this, It just bums me out.
Stop with the arrr politics stuff. We are our own people.
They‚Äôre the same picture
Circuit breakers only work when stocks go down
PLUG puts
CA kills that. Doesn‚Äôt matter.
Nasdaq halted
I just got a notice that Nasdaq futures were briefly halted. Is it true?
Have you even *heard* the mistakes that biden has made? Sometimes he doesn't even know what position he's running for. He even said "together we will defeat biden". There is NO excuse for this shit.
We should all YOLO on Wendys calls. If we lose it all, Im sure our interviews would be good.
Tech to the moooon
You right
[deleted]
Bulls gonna have blue balls when we open bloody
Stick up for yourself
When. And yes
[deleted]
Welcome to the futures bro. It‚Äôs been crazy all night
Just like 4 years ago just reverse
4 more years. Low taxes. Business growth. Law and order. Prosperity. Power. Respect!
What have good relations with china got us, many of our tech companies are banned from china (fb, google), they steal ip, force us companies to train their replacement in their market.

Does biden have a real chance still or what?
Trump won
Guys my intersectional feminist moon dancing group said Biden was a shoe-in what the fuck?????

Man I was truly convinced..
Why would TSLA go up?
I think so at least throughout Christmas
There‚Äôs a while until market open. Remember 4 years ago

Give them a couple hours to price in.  They are still forming and waiting on the go ahead from Soros...
It‚Äôs over
Why what even happened? Last time I checked the map he was dominating and I was heading to sleep
do you think they'll print? I thought they were pricing a Biden win...
Everything apparently
Biden would have won if he didn't say he was going to tax 40% capital gains. LOL
You only used them to hedge your other calls right?
Cal Cunningham shouldn‚Äôt have fucked his buddies wife
Yeah he fucked up, he needed a pragmatist, with an entrepreneurial background, that could pull votes from the other side. Sad!
Getting there .....
[deleted]
you got it. I'm just lurking over there to witness the butthurt. Fuck I voted for Biden but I'm not gonna be a bitch about it. reassess and make your plays
They keep focusing on paths for Biden to win. Why don‚Äôt you talk about other races instead...
Mr Musk let me off the simulator
üåàüê∂
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA
Now I wish I sold ATM spy put instead of OTM
No. This shits gonna be crazy contested
No circuit breakers on uppies
So do we go back on easy mode if Trump wins?
Yes
Calls on glaziers
Solar puts. All of them.
Have we ever heard Mrs. Mango IV speak?
Haha fuck my AAPL ans NVDA CCs too
Just on bovadas website
Biden is a fucking failure. U really couldn‚Äôt win just one state out of alllll the tossups? Lmao he deserves to lose
Fuck you and your cuck leader
I vividly remember futures being down 3-4% sometime this summer during shit covid news and then we opened flat and ended green
Idiots
This is what they said the first month spy went up from March lows, and look what happened
Trump is even winning the popular votes. Wild
Ya, definitely not the only reason. But a big one.
It‚Äôs going to print bud

LMAO I BET ITS hilarious over there rn
Calls all in tomorrow with the big Pumperino
Yo real talk tho, if Trump wins or looking like a winner by tomorrow, what to buy?
So TSLA 500 tomorrow right? Or is that too conservative?
lol when u think the market will go down. it wont! havent u gay bears realized this? the drop only happens when u dont expect it
Keep pushing yourself bro. Things will work out if you don‚Äôt give up.
No she's gonna spend it on pens to sign parole denials for people with drug possession charges

Well, it‚Äôs all done. Only 11 hours till the markets open in USA. Won‚Äôt change at all, never does, never will again. Congratulations! The last moments the market will ever trade. ü§î
Biden would've won if he didn't say "trudiderndershendurfer pressure"
Omg that was their reaction to the news they didn‚Äôt react yet. We reacted before them Christ
It‚Äôs a gift
It went up to 338 in after hours then dropped $5 in the last 10 minutes
Imagine being passionate about biden
Lame duck 4 years super bullish for tech
God I hope not.  What a stupid, stupid move.

Damn I‚Äôd hate to be a window this week
Fuck, my bovada account is inactive. Havent touched it in a while, but wanted to hedge my options
Because the mail-in votes affect the electoral college votes just like in-person votes?
Is it safe to go balls deep in the market tomorrow with no day trades left ?
Because Americans think for themselves.
Damn bruh what you do lol
Cause we're just spectating instead of preparing for civil war.
If solar stocks tank I‚Äôm buying the shit out of them cause solar is viable even without subsidies/incentives and will still be the future.
Bro if you watch tv it will literally tell you trump already won
They're huffing that copium

I was severely wrong it seems
Move on to the next one
Futures liked that
Futures may be green, but my FitBit calls are guaranteed going nowhere until the EU cuts this shit out. Do I get a political ban for bitching about EU corruption? Their Agricultural subsidies are such a shit show and everybody skims off the top.

Sorry bro but in berlin I have people screaming allahua akbar on hermannplatz as a french teacher got beheadet.
Nothing new here, carry on üòÇ
If trump keeps his lead in all of the toss up states, he wins
I literally don‚Äôt care who wins I just need my $TQQQ call to recover :(
How the fuck is Trump doing this good??? Even if he loses, couple of house seats in Florida flipped to GOP, Alabama back to GOP and GOP looks to be keeping the senate
Biden looking good in MI and WI

PA won't be called for days or weeks

looking good in AZ

JUST BECAUSE IT ISN'T A BLOWOUT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OVER
CNNs ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still early‚Äù denial is fucking hilarious
Says who? Could be 8 more.
for those not watching cnn, but want to know the sentiment? here u go...."it's still way too early"
You can only think this if you‚Äôre a fucking moron who‚Äôs never listened to Biden speak.  Thanks for telling me that‚Äôs who you are!
Probably knows you‚Äôre a bear. Gross
Yeah they don‚Äôt wanna watch mangos electoral vote go up!!
Jesus fuck what am I looking at
Cashing this Kanye West popular vote ticket. Thank you very much.
Totally agree, after watching MSNBC especially
I truly feel he lost any chance he had when he picked Kamala
Is donnie gonna win?
I wish I didn‚Äôt  seeing this. Now I will probably sell my shares before earnings, and regret. Happens every time I see something on WSB that makes sense.
Everybody needs to drop a note on r politics just for fun.  Who ever gets most downvotes wins.
Y‚Äôall stop brigading r/politics. We don‚Äôt need the admins to curb stomp this sub over y‚Äôalls retardation. And honestly who gives a fuck about that sub. I‚Äôm a liberal and I‚Äôm banned from there. Keep the shitposting in this thread, don‚Äôt be a sore winner.
Bite him
Nailed it
hope BABA prints tmrw ü•∫
Is there a stream for this?
No I mainly only use to watch liberal news which made me realize how brainwashed you people are.  Like you guys pushed me away by being so hateful. And realizing Trump is less racist than Biden and actually wants to help America.  You are so deep in your bubble you just getting spoon fed though. Don't have time to save ya.
It‚Äôa actually pricing in a trump win
Lol what
Calls on TWTR tomorrow if Trump does well- he is single handedly holding that company alive
4,000? Perhaps even more than that.
Suprised they haven't called Florida yet

Oh my b. Thought you were referring to the usual culprits
I have one...pouring some out for you homie
I thought I heard talks of raising interest rates sometime down the road in like a year. Obviously Trump is against them so I was just putting pieces together. 

But yes I‚Äôm new to the game. America, fook yeah üá∫üá∏
Fox called it tanking but didn‚Äôt look too bad. I was hoping for a boner because nothing brings me more happiness than China being crushed.
The last 30 min just sealed the deal for you I think...
Chinese yuan already dropping...  oddsmakers favor T
Never bet against America üá∫üá∏
They‚Äôre only sold in China. Someone elaborate on what could happen to nio it trump decided to take a hard stance against them? Other than somehow getting them delisted from the stock xchange.
Market doesn't care who wins. Market wants certainty. If the election becomes contested then it's going to go red. When Trump started winning Florida, futures dumped because of the uncertainty that brought.
So was it a limit up or not? üòÇ why the fuck would it be halted
holy shit r/politics is quite upset


-10 downvotes in like 5 seconds lmao

Same with SPY. Can't do options though.

what are we looking at for EOY? SPY 400?
TRUMP gonna FIRE fauci tommorrow
Fox News says Democrats picked up at least five more House seats, after picking up another 41 seats for a huge majority in 2018.  There‚Äôs no way we see that level of Democrats voting in this election without Biden winning.  That indicates an insanely huge majority of the popular vote, like 10%+. It‚Äôs not possible for Biden to lose with those levels of voting.

2018 looked bad initially for Democrats.  Their insanely huge victory wasn‚Äôt apparent until a couple of days after the election.  It looks like that will be happening again tonight.   

Get fucked all you fucking retards who voted for Trump to destroy our country for another four years.  I hope you enjoy losing!

Was 4.5%
If Repubs get the house, instant Stim, limit up
Holy fuck nasdaq calm down
Laughed very hard üëè
It really comes down to watching which states went to trump. Once OH and NC went, it was kind of like probably trump but with pa also going, it's really looking bad for biden. Someone hopeful in rpol said if biden can get Arizona (might will) and either wisconsin or michigan then bidens back in it. But it doesn't look like wisconsin or michigan are going biden. And truthfully, arizona might flip in an hour.
Let me check which calls do I hold... Hmm... Oh it‚Äôs SLV. Guh

If it really is +3% tomorrow, I wonder if it's time to get puts again. Maybe after one more rally after it

I mean we can acknowledge the past, but we don‚Äôt have to it hold us back forever. Also, maybe left wing people should actually try and talk to trump supporters... ya know have a convo. I have some good friends that are trump supporters, but I don‚Äôt hold that against them and we have nice chats about politics. Maybe demonizing all trump supporters as beyond awful people wasnt the best idea. Like people saying, ‚Äúunadd me if you support trump.‚Äù

Pretty sure Bush or Obama did it too during the financial crisis

What the fuck are you talking about. This is on WSJ. Typical Trump supporter who just assumes shit and spewing non sense
Don‚Äôt be. You made a prudent decision unlike most of the retards on this board
Brb, gonna go check how r/politics is doing.
Tryna figure out if Trump winning is good for my BABA calls. NASDAQ is overall up bigly but China stocks will probably drop. Might just end up flat üôÉ
It's low interest rates no matter who wins when the FED says they're going to keep low interest rates they do it otherwise they would lose credibility.

I know you guys are new to this game but it's not that hard.

Also China market CRASHING those tariffs are not going away anytime soon lmao
Up is up. Can't go broke taking profit!
Tech is up because the market is pricing in a Biden win, but a Republican senate. No stimulus will pass (benefiting tech when smaller businesses collapse), and no taxes/regulation.
But small business owners are greedy and selfish sweaty :) we need to shut down all businesses forever
What's going on with futures? NASDAQ up 3.3%??

Yes check the twitch streams people are already fighting and rioting
Damn AMZN call holders gonna be rich
When Trump wins the best part of my night will be going to r/politics and reading the election thread
Yea.
I was looking to get the boxy one just because it scatters police radar waves the same way as the F117.

Basically, it is invisible on the police radar.
i also went cash gang. Luckily i sold my puts right before market close. I think the risk/reward ratio not so good for fomoing on calls tomorrow.
r/politics is the hermit kingdom of Reddit
Tech is up so much because everyone knew the Dems wanted to break up big tech with antitrust charges. A blue wave would‚Äôve been devastating for tech.
Never thought I would say this, but I'm happy as hell to lose money on my puts.
This shit is getting contested. I'm buying puts at open.
PELOSI DENIED US A SECOND 1,200 CHECK FOR THIS???
So what's going on is trump winning hence the market is up
It‚Äôs only back to where it was a few days ago

As of today....is curaleaf in NJ only medicinal purchases?
Let me guess, you‚Äôre looking at his lead now vs 2016? Why not look at where trump started the night in NC and where he‚Äôs at now.... Look at what‚Äôs actually happening and quit watching CNN. They‚Äôre telling you what you want to hear so you HOPE he still will win.
You‚Äôre going to be surprised.  Even with a Trump win, they are going up.
Leaps but I‚Äôd be wary of Chinese companies

Y‚Äôall thought trump was bearish, shame on you
Agreed

Green as fuck. Who the hell is the market pricing in as the winner? Neither FOX, CNN, or Google have any idea.
Arizona and Wisconsin
As long as it doesn‚Äôt go down like everyone says bc of trump, I‚Äôm fine with flat

The same way they yolo all their money - with no dd but plenty of confidence.

Keep your first responders/officers in your thoughts they are going to have a brutal night. Riots will be insane.

So ICLN not gonna print.... ?
Step 1 don't call everyone racist
All of the polls said most Biden voters weren't voting FOR Biden, they were voting AGAINST Trump.

So much time wasted picking a Democratic candidate that even the Democrats didn't like.
He‚Äôs really kind of raking in the Hispanic votes. It‚Äôs a real weird time.
bears just need biden to pull a massive upset now

How did he ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the media?
Oof
Thank God my puts are on green energy ü§û

How hard is it to be bullish on America
Of course! That‚Äôs why stock futures are up.
Down
I don't see why a poc would vote for Biden either at this point. They just py lip service to issues that are grossly exaggerated to try to get cheap political points. The campaign is using yall and turning us against each other. I did vote for the dem running against John Cornyn though he's a piece of trash
Are my dkng 50c leaps saved?
[deleted]
Lol the liberal reactions are priceless
Woohoo!!!
i wish i bought more calls
How can they get around ‚Äúshy‚Äù trump voters? It‚Äôs an impossible task. No one likes admitting being a trump supporter
I mean, I wanted this outcome tbh, but just take care of yourself my dude.
It's amazing that people think the electoral college is bad for democracy because it never changes. Nothing is permanent.
no
Nailed it. When the left wants to raise the American flag and not burn it, I'll vote blue again.
Gotta keep people betting plus the west coast reports soon
I‚Äôm rich bitch!!
I'm a liberal at heart and want Sleepy Joe to win. But after looking at those NASDAQ futures, my calls aren't making me too sad
NC voted for a democrat governor but Trump for prez lol
There‚Äôs no way it whipsaws again tonight right?? Can‚Äôt from this high up right

Bovada
imagine nasdaq going up 4 percent

i must be dreaming 

someone wake me up
Draft kings
Yes it would change, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been predicting a potential ‚Äúblue fade‚Äù since they expect a majority of mail in ballots will be for Biden. Mail in ballots take a lot longer to validate and count
So tech up because trump leading? What happens if Biden come back?
I‚Äôll cum everywhere. Video to follow. Fuck off mods.
NASDAQ AND SPY FUTURES MOONING
Just came back to say fuck you and enjoy 4 more years of Trump45, you pinko fuck
Huge short interest going into tonight.  Gotta be covering/squeeze.
Big tech making tendies but they hate trump. Glorious ha.
Cringe how much Americans care about PC stuff, most of the stuff never affects you at all. Yet you allow it to be a decisive factor in a presidential election during a once in a 100 year pandemic.

The BLM riots crushed the Democrats.

Too drunk to freak out my dude.
He‚Äôs the only guy that doesn‚Äôt talk down on the middle/working class/minorities
No idea bro. Human decency seems to be in short supply these days. There are so many different reasons people may support a certain candidate and often times it‚Äôs not because they just think he‚Äôs a great guy lol. 

If Trump does win, I really believe it‚Äôs because the Democrats galvanized his supporters by belittling and trying to shame them for supporting him. Just my opinion.
‚ÄúI will only raise taxes for people making over $400k‚Äù

A 26 year old McDonalds worker in Kentucky with no college degree:

Why would we need stimulus?  The market is doing great!!
No shit
Bovada was the main one
Yeah, it‚Äôs still unclear who the market wants to win.

It‚Äôs a close race, anything can happen.

This is hilarious CNN will only project biden state wins when trump is far closer in every other state
90% counted in NC. Trump leads by less than 1 point
Boring, and then probably up even more
Yes
If these futures hold tomorrow is going to be lit.

I've spent 36 thousand buying the dips since September. Hoping for a big pay off
MY CALLS GONNA PRINT! Glad I played the election.
Joe Rogan has entered the chat
I don‚Äôt think it was capable in the US without martial law tbh
17th
So my TSLA calls may print?
Tesla at 460 tomorrow lol
Every pollster should be fired after this election. It baffles me how every single one of them is wrong especially after 2016.
Insert Hilary laugh
To be honest I don't think I remember a lot of Big Green Day's I usually close my portfolio on those days. I don't even remember any of September. My portfolio went up so I closed it
Absolute landslide
Yes
Came for the ‚Äúfutes mooning‚Äù content

No I think it‚Äôs means the trend continues

AAPL stock moons as IPhone 12 goes completely off the shelves

*but what the article won‚Äôt tell you is they were taken off the shelf by rioters who aren‚Äôt putting up with 4 more years of mango*
This. Who tf answers the phone when it's an unknown number
Qqq up because it‚Äôs all growth and low interest rates if mango man wins?
Wasn‚Äôt Trump supposed to reignite the coal industry? Let‚Äôs ask the Appalachian people how their coal jobs are looking since 2016
Mango speaks properly. This is true
I think Biden is gonna win but Trump is gonna have massively beaten his polling expectations again
Why the eff didn‚Äôt I hang onto my tech calls I messed up
Futures are up on a dem senate flip. Cool your tits if won‚Äôt last
What does this mean for EV like TSLA and NIO
Yuuuuup
It's the media telling them how to think and what to think. A lot of them don't follow politics very closely and just take their information from the fake media.
Wait till this guy figures out that the election isn‚Äôt over yet
No we don‚Äôt
Love this
I vote 69 likes for this comment^
I remember 6 hours ago being called a retard and a bunch of other pejoratives for saying this weeks numbers showed it was going to be close and trump had a chance. Hmm.. it is what it is, I just hope everyone is doing okay out there. I figure a lot of dudes are freaking out
Eh. Maybe they can walk to a South American country or Canada. Honestly, if people are so opposed to the majority feelings of the democracy, we should help them with incentives to get elsewhere. A one way ticket is probably more affordable than the alternatives.
when trump went past 100 it mooned

This is an ignorant take. Most farmers have million+ dollar operations.
It's called a joke.
This is a way closer race than most were expecting and I think it could create market volatility - but even though that's a super obvious take, don't take it from my sperg ass
Any of you betting on the election? If so what site you using?

Also, all the rioting and looting. Yeah people might say abolish the police, but people know deep down that‚Äôs fucking insane. Honestly biden policy doesn‚Äôt seem that bad. It‚Äôs just all the fucking crazy ass left wing people that are so fucking PC and everything is racist or sexist.

Should've just chose Obama as his running mate.
Is NIO gonna crash tomorrow because of this ? :(
Just realized how big Alaska is holy shit it's bigger than Mexico
What states are those?
Yeah I don't know what you're thinking I'm looking at the votes right now and that map and Trump is looking real good right now. I am not going to get worked up over no election though it looks like my portfolio is going to love the next four years and I ain't going to complain.

Got to look at this dispassionately
Shit I should have bought more aapl calls today
People are going to say not yet. But I‚Äôm going to say yes. This wasn‚Äôt supposed to be close to begin with.
Soooo, are my tech calls gonna moon?
What if last week was a big bear trap
The closer to 50/50 they make it, the more the country can be divided. A landslide isn‚Äôt wanted.
Tech about to go crazy ü§ë
Whats nio doing tomorrow
I hope someone harvests all of their bigoted comments in politics and shares them throughout the next few years
Shut the fuck up
Puts on NIO?
What media?  There are no journalists anymore.  Just propagandists shilling for Dems and Globalists.
Naaa I think we good but who the fuck knows
My SLV calls might be ok after all
Yeah, might be the next "dgaf about what's going in the rest of the market, I'm mooning" stock.
Fuck boomer stocks
Shit trump is going to lose Arizona üëÄ. Should i feel worried for trump
Good plan brother.
I'm mostly apolitical, but if it's Trump four more years I'm going to switch the station if he's on radio or TV. It rots my brain
Cause they‚Äôre partisan hacks. 

Most of America is going to finally realize this

Polls are worthless.
NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahaha
Trump beat COVID, the media, and now maybe Biden. Hell of a year.
DNC had huge influence over primaries. Several prominent candidates dropped out right before the first super Tuesday and all of them endorsed Biden. They did that because DNC pushed Biden
Better than puts, glad I didn‚Äôt get too many

Only pussies hedge
Saw Trump and tuned-out.  Went over to r/kpopfap and returned to type this.
Majority of people have other sources of news besides reddit
And you think the way Trump talks are perfect coherent sentences? Lmao you're a fool as much as the libs are
Every call imaginable
Too many Californians moved there
FB calls as soon as the market opens?
I feel like an idiot for believing the pollsters, thinking that they must have learned their lesson from 2016, and tried to capture that shy Trumptard vote.

But the real retards are at the polling and the media industry, aren't they? Jesus Christ.
Only certain states matter, the ones which are likely to go either way and Trump is performing well everywhere he needed to pretty much.
TQQQ is an ATM
I think they actually have to have skills because those countries don't fuck around and just let anyone in.  So ironic.
Media outlets has biases...
Doesn‚Äôt look like it homeboy
How is the Texas race closer than PA or OH
can't wait for the meltdown compilation.
*but I am too*
Biden is weaker than hillary was, not a surprise he's losing to trump. If covid wasn't a factor this would have been a landslide
DONNIE WIN & BRING ME TENDIES
Looks like the R's will keep the senate
Huge pro trump
At exactly 9:45?
Grabbed SPY 350c and 320p at eod as lottos, one of them has to hit big hopefully.

No , it can come crashing to 330 in 30 mins just like how it went from 334 to 343 in 30mins. Wait until open before you start dreaming about the tendies.
Thank you for your tears

Yeah and that‚Äôs not how it works lol
Unless we have some mail in fuckery, Nate Silver is finished nomatter who wins
It does appear so. I thought the market was pricing in Biden‚Äôs win and that it would tank if Biden didn‚Äôt win.

But looking at futures, it appears that all the news about market pricing in Biden‚Äôs win was false.
Red=Green
Was asking for a ballpark, people imply that it‚Äôs expensive
No way the Trump supporters survive No Nut November after tonight

No blowjob if you eat meat and drive V12 engine car
I already got trump +160 the other day should I jump in Biden +270 too?
honestly do you liberal believe that Biden's gaffes were just coincidences? Then why the fuck do they appear in almost every sentence of his? He clearly has something wrong with him. I can't wrap my head around why anyone would vote for him. He can't even speak properly let alone run a fucking country. 

Trump did 7 rallies yesterday and Biden can't form a fucking sentence.
It's a hard knock life, always money to be made, you'll bounce back.
They probably should just rename it to r/democrats
It‚Äôs fucking hilarious - giving out trigger warnings telling their viewers to take a deep breathe
I‚Äôm so fucked. Trump win is gonna be doubly painful

I was @ 100k in June from 9k back down to 50k. A trump victory will put me at 200k hopefully ;(

Should be at 1 million if I played tesla lol
Four more years :)
Where can I watch Nate Silver?
Lol

Nah man. It‚Äôs üíéüëê
Tech boys better post gain porn tomorrow.
I want to catch this NIO train üöÇ. If it dips a little tomorrow
Can't tell if your joking but trump is winning states he wasn't expected too like Florida. Media isn't reporting but look at stock futures and even betting odds
They want to keep their fracking jobs.
Majority of Americans are educated non gay bears
Time for WSB to raid r/politics?
CNN talking gaming Biden path to victory - they expected to be talking about trump not conceding
no. perfect outcome for markets actually.
CNN is in shambles
How. It‚Äôs the electoral colleges votes that count.
Finally a dem admitting Dems give tax breaks to the rich

Vix can go up even with positive movement, its not a measure of upsies or downsies, its volatility, depends on the size of the move. Positive movement just usually means more stability so it goes down
MMs were the only ones buying Mon/Tue because they knew... they knew
idk why AP had 96% reported. im seeing 55 on other sites. thx!

How to buy calls on Russia?
Do we know how many mail-in votes have been counted? I feel like these could affect the results bigly. I think there was like 90M mail-in/early votes this year which is like 75% of the total turnout in 2016.

I'M LITERALLY SHAKING HOW IS THIS HAPPENING
Associated press

Tried to buy some at close and RH shit the bed and didn't fill them

He's behind on offically called states, but way ahead if you count the ones still up in the air.
Holy moly QQQ futures at 3.5% right now
Lots of hype behind it and no bad news so far, so it might be a wild ride up until then. I remember when it was making its ride to $20 and people were skittish that would be the top
They‚Äôre still holding hedges until winner is announced.  When that happens -10 percent
Peri = close/about
This is actually hilarious. Calls on concealed carry permits.
I‚Äôm already just ready to hop on the unprecedented hype train that will be the Gabbard/West ticket in 4 years
Possibly. But wait til they see the salary cap impact that not playing has, they‚Äôll be playing right quick after that.
May have gone a bit too high a bit too fast... Bad trip, anyone?
Are my TILRAY calls kil if orange man wins?
Ew, large text
Which is ironic because most rural people don‚Äôt have investment portfolios

I have solar calls. I think they r fuk
Honestly, no one fucking knows
Haha
Where you seeing odds?
great engineer, great leader...

apparently, a horrendous negotiator.
If there is 200,000 COVID cases per day and 2000 deaths I don't think the markets will be climbing. Trump disregards the science and even stated he is going to fire Fauci.
Yeah. I'm PoC, but I can see why virtually no white person (esp if you have a dick) would vote for Dems. It's fucking insane why they are trying to antagonize the most dominant group in America.
who didnt see this coming
They should have chosen Yang. Would love to see him going at mango
What do you do with a periscope?
Ever wonder what happens to Chad when he grows old? He becomes the +800 favourite in the presidential election.
So Sleepy's tariffs were a big neg to the market, is that why we are seeing an almost 5% rise in NASDAQ?
Why did I not buy more 354c (end of month) and 400c (Jan) ahhhdhjdjdegehjdj!!!!!!!
Not in electoral votes yet but he‚Äôs leading in most key states
GG
Looks like it.
Stonks
People voted for Biden in the primary.  DNC has some sway but in the end the people chose him to go up against Trump.  Both sides are retarded apparently.
Square
LMFAO no shit but a rally this hard that‚Äôs green should make it shit harder

+4% up on futures, swing down to -4% and then another up to end the day flat
Big oil doesn‚Äôt lose

Mango wins and nasdaq loves ittttt. Fuck I wish I was trading futures too
Your son's my boyfriend's wife's boyfriend. He says no.
Will my BAshares and calls print?? Down 9k
So the majority of Americans are secretly racist
Stop giving me hope I‚Äôll actually nut
They receive a 2-3% response rate on average
I‚Äôm not seeing any sites where Trump is ahead, does anyone have a link to one? I‚Äôve checked NBC, CNN, BBC, ABC, and AP.
I don't either but I am loving it holy shit
You‚Äôll be fine then.

Possible - still a major cliff. But I think it could swing a lot lower. There's crazy psychology and delusion everywhere.

Whatever happens, it's going to be amusing.

That‚Äôs not how Vix works
[deleted]
you must be new bro everything is bullish
What if we open red.. bulls would be in literal shambles after seeing +4%
Just very surprised with his track record so far, but based on my votes I guess nobody else on this sub agrees (or maybe assumes I'm one of those hyper left /politics people). Ah well.
what happens when dems win both houses tho

So shut the fuck up and go fuck yourself
Prayin for you man thanks for all you do
They don‚Äôt want to look like jackasses if they‚Äôre wrong
This feels fishy - shouldn‚Äôt VIX be way lower with a moon like this?
Why are you all saying Trump won?
Went on a shit-posting rampage at r/politics and they put a 14 minute time out on my account

EDIT: Nvm, they deleted all of my comments.
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life
Jump in no matter what. Election is done, back to business as usual

Something with the election? I haven't been following the live results.
11/17/20
Yep, during the sell offs last week
Most reliable sources lol
Exactly right man. At least someone gets it. They need to get rid of the electoral college, it's not 1787 anymore. Even in Florida which Trump won tonight, the big cities were all blue.
Tech is rallying and carrying S&P with it. Ultra large tech companies generally do better with red White House
Literally what I‚Äôm thinking too
Lol
Same buddy
Because real republicans aint got time to do a 30 minute questionnaire

Chinese for Trump üá∫üá∏

I would say Trump likes America, but not more so than himself, and there's a difference between being a patriot and being an effective national leader.

With Biden, it was looking like whatever he believes in, he's a non-entity. Maybe I swallowed the Trumptard fake news, but that's the perception anyways. And I can easily believe that Harris ain't a patriot.
For real

Nah, Trump train has already been priced in.
Riots in the streets and gains in my portfolio
Not sure you realizet the damage Trump has done with the U.S. relations with their greatest allies. I mean Trump has publicly tweeted critism for G6 leaders while praising NK. It's messed up. Not to mention he is full of hate, incites division, and the U.S. economy will eventually have a severe recession.

This is the second time tonight I"ve heard this dude on ABC say "the state of Atlanta". WTF man.
I have December spy 342 Calls
But I support biden

I feel fucking weird right now

Even with techs pumping like fuck, I bet you Apple my calls still not going to moon.
yo so can someone give me an update I just took a 4 hour exam and got fkd. whats going on
Bears punching the air
Non-partisan question: Who are the markets rallying for?? Too much info and too rapid to track the correlation between futures and polls. Or is it just the reduced volatility expected post-election?
OK retard

Nasdaq futes trading halted momentarily after the massive rally
Thanks for the cash!
that'd would be literally buying the top, chill for a bit and get back in by selling puts, or roll out calls to next week for extra premium if you think they'll go up even more short term after +4% on the daq

mmm we dont want you Covid asses in canada mmkay? thanks
Futes options are cheap as fuck
They are not calling alot of states like FL or TX yet. Also some of the states they called at the start are alot tighter then they should be. Check out politicos map
Turns out people want law & order
Will I be buying the top tomorrow? Guys hold me
Rip my put

Holy shit wtf is going on???
RIP Elon
I have like 5k in BIGC calls I was gonna sell before earnings. Is that part of NASDAQ? lol
EOW
Lmao, that's what I'm thinking.

As the problems mount and maybe reversed calls and other bullshit, let alone the immediate declarations by both campaigns of wins and court cases, massive cliff down.

Also going to be hilarious when somehow I am completely wrong though!
Hollywood‚Äôs gonna be PIIIISSSSSED
Tax cuts will not be rolled back and trump is pro business/corporations..not that hard to figure out
but more laser focused on corporations and none to the poor
Just don‚Äôt bother to go there. They won‚Äôt give u 10 bagger options

Strange year due to mail in ballots
Hell nah
Uh futures are showing a fucking huge green dildo at the moment. Your AH price is already old and outdated
Anything not related to solar or weed.
Looks like buying the dip over and over again, pays off again.
My god.
Gonna see r/politics implode if trump wins
They're Trudeau voters now.
LETS GO BABYYYYYYYY

Aaah i see. Thank you, now I understand
Honestly 50/50 chance lol

Why don't I ever fucking learn
Dude wtf.. it took me so long to figure out these were strikes for SPY and not TSLA.. da fuq is wrong with you? Holy shit..

!RemindMe 1 week
It's got to be an attempt at manipulation, right?

They did the same fuck up as 4 years ago
If you mean red states, then yes.

My roommate plays futures (he has rich parents) and I just heard him yell FFFFFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKKKK! I know they're going crazy and I know he lost 20k. Minimum.
My plastic is off now
Urban areas are the only ones left to be counted in mass (10-20% reported vs 90% reported for rural/suburban)
They can do one last gay bear orgy before they die.

Jumping in.

that guy that buy $300m in spy calls is fucking JUICED right now
You pay gimps to edit your photos? Neat idea for people who can‚Äôt last the whole hour they paid for I guess.
It takes a couple days to let everything settle, usually later in November they will have the electoral college vote. It just gets done before early December

Ho Lee Shit nasdaq
Lmfao. You might as well buy spy puts if you want to waste your money
Please do.
They WANT TRUMP to win. Not that he‚Äôs actually winning.
Imagine being Lebron, Michael Jordan and Bloomberg - paying crime fees for millions of felons so they could vote for Trump.
Yeah pretty much vegas and Wall Street know
i have never seen this kind of nasdaq rally since March. holy fuck
We will see MASSIVE swings
[deleted]
so..how do explain this pump on stonks right now that trump is leading ?
Absolutely.
It is. We're not finding out who wins tonight and they will plummet
Nasdaq +1000 tomorrow.
what would you have bought if you weren‚Äôt a retard?
In the name of my SPY puts, I hope you are right.

Holy shit
Hey retards, urban counties take longer to report. Give it 12 hours
It‚Äôs off now

There‚Äôs a reason trump wants to call this election tonight. He‚Äôs been saying it for months. It‚Äôs about to get crazy.
I use the investing.com app
10000%
Really!?
RIP
Lol no. Gonna get crushed by IV
Omg nasdaq futures halted for 2 minutes after 3.9% rally. LOL this is an inverse circuit breaker
#The opinion polls were propaganda all along.
Why
Nope ü§™
odds swung sharply backwards for what it's worth
Shares of spy calls ü§£ü§£
can someone update me? 

if the market thinks Trump will win, futures go up? and right now, the market thinks Trump will win and futures are up? or do I have it backwards?
Do you really need to ask?
imagine if the dems actually trotted out a competent candidate
Why are futures up so much tho? Legit question
Been asking myself this all evening. At one point trump‚Äôs lead was huge so I thought they had percentages flipped
Donnie did it he got another 4 years holy shit prepare for riots in the streets

This is really important guys, if futures stay steady do you think we will see profit taking or people jumping in?

Not necessarily Biden but the big boys dont like uncertainty.
How the fuck are pollsters so fuckin bad at their job
nate silver is fucking retarded. fucking biased statistics and bullshit math.random(0,1) rolling
Apparently my moves tomorrow are selling my fucking solar stocks.
Trump would destroy Bernie.

Biden supporters in shambles

solar puts
Spy 500 eoy confirmed
It really is a landslide
Stuck to 420
Can we open red af please ü•∫ü•∫
I'm only seeing 55% counted? Not sure if mail in ballots are counted after the in person for Virginia.
I am not seeing any blue wave yet
If you had 20 of them, you can get a Tesla... or just blow it on more calls
LOL who thought that was a good idea?.. like we don't trust these people.. lets just have a vote for fun i guess?
The shambles is strong over there lol
Philadelphia said they aren't announcing any more mail ballots until tomorrow.  PA not getting decided tonight
Where da fuck you all seeing futures?  I use ameritrade and I can‚Äôt see it.
PELOSI YOU OPTIMISTIC?
No sure what‚Äôs wrong with nasdaq futures , Wall Street bet on Biden seems he is losing and futures are green ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?
No WSB told me that.
Wtf. Bro trump won already. You not watching it
I have too many open positions I don't even know if I'm happy rn
AMA: Unloaded about $35,000 in tqqq, qld, fngu, and tecl.
He's leading in most of the contested states already, they just haven't been counted yet.  Its still close cuz CA has a huge electoral piece but its lookin blood red for the entire mid west.
HAHAHA all the brainwashed leftists are finally realizing that the market has been hoping for a trump victory!!!!!
I think we hit the ceiling.
fugue state
Sorry. Just been looking for confirmational bias that NIO is going to correct bigly üòÇ
‚ù§Ô∏è
Blue wave... I believe the market is cool with a blue wave or with trump winning and the senate staying red.  It‚Äôs looking like the latter and the market is cool with it.
Where do I see this live and why do Vegas people know what is gonna happen if we are still waiting for all key states to report?
Since it's qqq, I think traders think trump wins and more ridiculous tech regulation is off the table.

I literally had a cellphone company tell me to pay a bill because it'd be easier for me than disputing the charge every time they make a "mistake". 

Go after the internet and cellphone companies that fuck with the one thing EVERYONE uses. 

Big tech regulation is not the most pressing thing.

Data caps and other bullshit is... No one wants our search history going anywhere....

It means you didn't embrace the culture here

Not sure what they are counting in GPU market share, but if they are including integrated graphics from CPUs / SoC, then that‚Äôs probably what is inflating AMD‚Äôs market share. Where is intel on that market share analysis? Would tell you a lot bc Intel makes no discrete GPUs. The problem with AMD is their actual discrete GPUs market share is much smaller than Nvidia, and the tech has historically lagged (both hardware and software / drivers). Therefore, when you think about applications of both - AMD‚Äôs ATI line of GPUs have been used in video game consoles, where manufacturers are price sensitive (trying to keep costs low). But in the higher end market and faster growing markets - data centers, AI, computer vision, big data analytics, etc. they are all running NVDA GPUs. Hence, NVDA has seen higher growth and in turn commands a premium multiple. 

AMD is trying to turn the ship around, but their problem is they have historically been 2nd in both CPUs and GPUs. A good alternative, but not the market leader in either
I have 20 lots of SPY 335 Call bought for $6.2 per, $12.4k total. Am I rich yet?
It's dead Jim
congratulations and sincerely, fuck you
Montreal is awesome. So is Vancouver
How‚Äôs TSLA gunna look tomorrow bois ?
Wow Trump might make me rich
For months bears were dreaming of a circuit breaker

Probably not this kind though üòÇ
Why aren't they calling Florida for Trump yet?

Nate silver needs to invest in $rope lot of seasoned investors here to help him
Not the House, I think Senate is still Republicans though.
I can only get so erect

DUMB ASS DEMOCRAT BOOMER IDIOTS XD

They didn‚Äôt add up all the electoral votes for the key states.. but it‚Äôs looking like he may get the W like 2016

LMAO
Trump win
We're not finding out who wins tonight boys bulls r fuk
Choo choo
He was -775
have u chdcked nasdaq futes lately?
Didn't get the reference lol
I thought I was the only one
The people have voted, fuck COVID.
I love watching r/politics and seeing them realize that there are a lot of people who have different political views than you see on Reddit
well he looks like he could still lose Arizona and there are many ballots that won't be counted till tomorrow. But, generally speaking, I agree with you. The model is predicting 65% chance Trump win so there is still some uncertainty but the models previously were giving him a 10% chance.
If NQ breaks this resistance it‚Äôs going to 12.3 omg that‚Äôd be so many tendies.
Futures hit 420 for a sec there. RIP Biden. Imagine losing to Trump.
[deleted]
What about TSLA calls?
I hope so, I need to get in when there's a dump
Trump said fuck big tech, big tech says plus 10%
Does TSLA sell shares for its company?
#Biden very confused right now
Yes my dick
How does Google have Biden winning Virginia already when Trump has an 8% lead???
ofc
fuck i had my finger on the trigger on that GEO call and couldnt do it
Wait tech futes really up 3% lmao. Wtf is going on
Bears in shambles. Never bet against Murica!
All these Reddit liberals in shambles LMAO
You get the odds you bet. I took trump +135

Does this bode well though? Feels like ‚ÄòGyna tariffs‚Äô are just around the corner cuz ‚Äúwe gotta make them pay!‚Äù
Always inverse the winners
Roll it out
LMAO Trump is -400 on betting markets? What the fuck happened in these last 3 hours?

I wasn't super shocked in 2016, but i will be if he somehow pulls 2020 out of his asscheeks.
It‚Äôs not
Yeah, $TSLA has been just awful under Trump, right?
Holy fuck
BEARS, THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO GET GAPED.
Has nasdaq futs every been halted before lol

Ummmm what just happened to nq?

when you ostracize one group of people so much that they can no longer voice their opinion one way, polls will show the other way
My nio is big fuk
Does this mean that the recent "bear" market was really just a "Biden" market? Holy shit.
Those are polls.. Maybe look at actual numbers.. If looking at polls trafalgar polls are accurate. Only one to predict trump win in 2016
RIP bears tomorrow
Senate race 11-8 reps but the moon mission continues.
I think the markets had a trump win all along but then they got sketched out for 2 minutes
Barring some crazy shit, he‚Äôs about to take some big states like Texas and Florida
Essentially
That‚Äôs like trying to call the direction of the market tomorrow. There‚Äôs really no way for you to know that it wouldn‚Äôt have been better.
Nasdaq futures up 4% , what in the fuck ?!
Fuck man why didn‚Äôt I just get tech calls I got shitty PFE calls and JNW

Wow, that joke went right over your head.
Bovada

538 said early voting tends to be democrat, take that for what its worth though.
you are fucked future just gapped the fuck up
Rip to my puts.   ffffffffffff
dear futures,

you still have 5% to go.

signed, 
dynamic circuit breakers don't exist on the upside, the whole thing's a scam
So guys, trumps gonna win so I‚Äôm gonna most likely shove a pineapple up my ass and dick hole and move to canadurh. What‚Äôs a good city in canadurh to move too that enjoys stonks and big dick energy? None? Ok fine I‚Äôm not moving. 

I‚Äôm drunk, sorry
Did you really just question me? You fucking nazi
Is it because he won key states already even though he's down in the electoral votes?
Look on Google election map or Bloomberg. It‚Äôll show the map. It is ü•≠ as far as I can tell.
[removed]
It would appear this may be a deluge of misinformation.
What happened to this
NQ JUST IMPREGNATED ME
Lol how
People just yapping. Ignore them, focus on Google.
[deleted]
It's 75% of my portfolio
Hopefully it becomes as overvalued as TSLA.
This is what I want to know
Wait I thought Wallstreet wanted Biden? Mooning on Trump? This shit wild.
Any run back towards 300 would make my tip tingle
Bovada has Biden +275 to win. Good hedge for my calls?
Short panic covering
I‚Äôm not disagreeing but idk anyone that‚Äôs actually concerned about it. Only concerned about when we can go back to normal. Not how it‚Äôs being handled, vaccine, etc. just when we can go back to doing everything normally.

Mango is winning practically every swing state that polls showed he was losing bigly. What a joke. Puts on pollisters.

Fuck yea that‚Äôs how we roll haha buncha retirees up in here, we‚Äôve got an early bedtime so we gotta count this shit quick
I‚Äôm pouring my entire net worth into calls as soon as the mart open tomorrow
Love it üòÑ
i'm moving back to canada anyway lol
Hate the Mango Man, but can't blame Americans for not voting for the Dems. 

Biden was looking like a crypt zombie and it was obvious that the Dems were trying to sneak in Harris as the backdoor president, cause GIRL POWER SLAYYY and BLM, or something. Even though Harris was a prosecutor.

Dems took this election for granted again, and are now paying the price. Even if they end up winning, they are going to have a big stinking turd on their face. This was supposed to be a landslide, and it would have been if they didn't fuck around.

Futures is about to drop hard, but I still see us opening at least +1% if Trump wins (assuming that‚Äôs why futures is pumping)
Then you clearly don't understand how penn works lol
Holy shit nasdaq
Lol wut
Best comment
Should have been buttigeg or yang
It‚Äôs up?
TX, NC, and GA are all but called by NYT if trump wins OH, PA, and either MI or WI that is ball game.  The rest are safe states like MT, ID, MO, IA  and he should pick those up with ease Arizona won't matter
Holy FUCK Nasdaq
tonight is erection night
Voted for Biden and loaded up on SPY puts. How do I always make the wrong decisions when the odds are 50/50
Nasdaq isn‚Äôt halted you mouth breathers
I do not feel good holding SQQQ
This is MAGA country
But it‚Äôs been going up during his presidency though?
Fellow wsb retards what will be of NIO? I think short term dump and fast rebound? I might be in shambles LOL

Something does not feel right about what we are seeing right now. But I'm also shoving marbles up my ass as we speak
It‚Äôs to late
We joke about being retarded.  But r/politics is a retarded echo chamber of reeeeeeee

Place is fucking toxic.
Are you following the swing states? Like hes leading currently in most of the swing states, these states determine the winner, not your typical party stronghold states.
Is this going to effect Tesla?
Russell 2000 swings from -2% to up 1% in like 30 seconds, jesus christ
Flair checks out
Trump is keeping Michigan and possibly Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is leaning Trump. Ohio is leaning Trump. It‚Äôs not good for Biden at all
MAYBE UR VIX AND VXX CALLS AREN'T DEAD
RSI pushing too much, SPY cut to cycle industries, Trump will surprise the U.S, too much money in SPY at close betting against (unless it's a MASSIVE hedge).

Too early
Nah Biden lost
I mean, yeah. Futures get manipulated into oblivion and have been swinging wildly all night. It could mean literally anything.

Let's just stop this nonsense and actually see how things look tomorrow. Then we don't have to argue in theoreticals.

So it turns out the riot about the presidency, but is  instead just thousands of angry bears
Everyone keeps saying Trump has already won, but everything I find when I google it (538, politico, etc) says Biden is up. What's the discrepancy?
Pretty funny how the DNC could've probably taken this if they'd learned their lesson with Hillary and just gone with Bernie... but they just had to go with the guy that has trouble putting together coherent sentences
[deleted]
Yup. These futures are retarded as fuck
NASDAQ about to hit limit up (+5%)
It‚Äôs now -600 peach

I hope it doesn't all happen pre market so I can get in with the FOMO
Yeah we‚Äôre fucked
so if I sold covered calls against AAPL and AMD to hedge, should I buy them back right at open or just chill for a bit?
You definitely can't check Penn yet. Philly missing most of its count
Got it.  Thought you meant after today... yea, that seems strange.
anyone who doesnt sell on a limit up is retarded

Puts on pollsters, what fucking retards
He is losing PA and MI. It‚Äôs ova
The idea that the dems would have had a better shot with Bernie is so LOL
I'm so torn. Not a fan of mango but he's good for my stonks.
If electoral college calls a state one way but the absentee ballots show the opposite over the next couple days, can the E.C. vote change or is that it?
/NQ 2m halt over. Shorts getting absolutely fucking smoked.

If biden don't carry PA it's game over.
Is there a chance we don‚Äôt know whos President for a few days?
If bovada had biden at -300 a week ago do you keep those odds or are they updated
apparently Virginia started counting mail-in votes after the polls closed for some reason

Really liking this PBS livestream. Alabama just elected a college football coach to the US senate lmao.
Is this trump being more lax on big tech regulation?
watching vids of Haka dances while looking at the pumping futures giving me chills rn. fuck yea
The fomo tomorrow will pump market to 3600.
These next two weeks will be the best rally the market has ever seen
They directly refer to ‚Äúwe‚Äù as if all the chat was liberal. 

Hang on a minute...

[deleted]
Ohio, check.
North Carolina, check.
Pennsylvania, check.
Florida, check.
Man they are dumb as fuxk
Feels surreal to see futures jump like +/- 10 in a second!
They've only counted about 20% of the absentee ballots on these swing states. They account for about 45% total vote. So it's possible you still have about 30% yet to be counted that will lean heavy dem. Too early to know
I was accidentally on r/politics thinking it was WSB and was like damn did the IQ here drop even more? Noticed I was on the wrong sub. Phew. ü•∞
Some swing states are not called yet but show Trump in favor.
They were right it was gonna be a landslide victory.. just not for Biden
400
/ES went up 90 points in 30mins lol , crazy
Cocaine when

The mail in votes might be the dark horse in all of this

Bears are about to get anally gaped.
wouldn't trump be winning early on and as the mail-in ballots get counted go towards biden? so in a way, it is too early to celebrate?
I mean, it‚Äôs not really a debate. Markets are swinging with Trump‚Äôs chances. Giving money to the person you think will win and who you want to win are 2 different things FYI

BEARS R FUKT.
I haven‚Äôt seen futures this green since March holy shit
Asking the real question
Nasdaq wants to return to 12,000 hard.
DOW barely green wtf lol
You bet against America, then you're asking for r fuk.
Chances? It's almost certainty now
pattern analyse , is like ooga booga wudu stuff
This. This is what will happen. We need to stop pretending this is a one day thing, shits gonna drag out
Do you really think it's that simple? Futures went from red to green for the moment and the election is uncalled, therefore Wall Street didn't back Biden? 

Good God I can't believe you tagged me for this. Don't do that again thanks.
Holy shit wow
Tech futures up 4% holy shit
Looks like it‚Äôs already removed. U banned?
squeeezee dem gay bears
Maybe you misunderstood and I wasn‚Äôt clear. I mean Biden winning right now don‚Äôt mean shit. Those 2 states can put trump ahead of Biden.
Yeap I shocked myself with the realization.
Dude are you a dumbass? Just asking if there will be a correction. Not asking for investing advice. Asking for a trading advice. And yeah, it‚Äôs possible that it ran up more than it should‚Äôve from fomo and Biden‚Äôs support in EV industry.
It's so huge that the green dildos can't fit in the chart
[deleted]
Big tech = big DICK
feel like we heading to SPY 400 end of year.
He was just -775
Might be too late to buy calls tomorrow?
Lol it's gonna be insane. What if AAPL is up like 10%?
this is the wildest swing in futures Ive ever seen from minute to minute for hours.  I imagine all the hedge fund election prediction algos are working late night.
God no matter the result, looks like my portfolio will be happy it seems.
Holy shit that‚Äôs it for tonight

I voted Kanye too. One, because this whole spectacle deserves it. Two, I want to see the post mortem blaming the Kanye vote for swinging the election.

I was never voting for either. My vote is for chaos. Fuck all y'all for telling me I have to pick a side.
Dunno, Trump has no incentive to pump the market after reelection unless he plans on living another 4 years and going 3 terms.

Biden I would imagine would increase taxes on investors encouraging them to realize gains this year.
Holy shit nasdaq futures up 4%
how much of a lead is 400k in florida with 91% reporting? They should call that shit right?

aight
Trump now 77% chance of win https://twitter.com/OddsShark/status/1323821149504049153?s=20
Fox News said Dems won the house? Is that true? They also said Biden has  a 85% chance of winning North Carolina where NYT says Trump has a 94%  chance of winning NC
Biden should be ahead early in Ohio and Pennsylvania he's already behind in both.

If you're a Democrat you should be sweating cause this is major bad.
I mean I voted for Biden and Kamala

Just seems to be an issue with some voters

Tucker Carlson has been dropping real bombs tonight
thats exactly what futures did tonight
Will it be too late to get in calls tomorrow if Trump clearly wins?
GOP everything would be best, but Dem Senate & House + Trump might work bigly in the short-term from a stimulus perspective.

If Dems have both though, they will also 100% try to impeach again, and again, and again - until it passes.

He obviously gonna win
Yeah but they just started counting mail in ballots which is like 60% of them
It's over, it's literally completely and utterly over. If you don't think so go put your money on Biden to win and you'll 4x it
Really???
Uh yeah lol

What a bunch of childish fuckin losers lol. Wowzaz
The peaceful protests hurt Biden...BIGLY
The blood will flow orange.
If Trump manages to pull off the same win as 2016,

A) He made a deal with the devil.

B) This is his tv show, we're just living in it.

People don't realize too stimulus won't even go through until Januaryish. That's at the earliest.
Dem party just didn't want to listen to Bernie and his calls for populism, and allowed Trump to subvert them. Very weird decision. They must be truly owned by the wealthy, and now the Repubs are the party of religious nationalists. This country is toast.
Biden still leading electoral college, just remember you can still win the popular vote , but still lose cause the opposing candidate had more votes in electoral college
Man, I am so happy I went all in.  Please baby keep these levels for tomorrow.  I have made huge gains so far and I need a solid run to peel off some trades and raise more cash!!!!!

Lumber and plywood is often traded in cost per thousand (board foot). 900m for a standard piece of plywood (4x8/32sqft) would be calculated like this : 32√ó.900=$28.80 per sheet.

Lumber is a bit difference.  You can calculate price per foot or board (2x4/12=0.6666x.900=.60 per ft 2x4x8/12=5.333x.900=$4.80 per 8' board).
so odds are trump is winning
Are my NIO calls fucked

I am not a fan of learning from colbert and local news like everyone who hates trump is. i also am libertarian to a fault. so i dont have a horse in the race, but biden is not honest... not honest at all
Who the fuck said market priced biden win
I‚Äôll say it again, what the fuck is happening lmao

The right are all brigading /r/politics to pretend to be democrats all upset that Trump is going to win, lol.

It's a weird-ass strategy though, I don't really get the point. Do they think that if they can convince /r/politics that Biden is going to lose, that will somehow affect the election? I don't get it.
Or $200. But probably $5. Most likely $50.

I think they base that on how each county voted in the past. They can deduce who will win the state as long as some counties have fully reported and they know how the fully reported counties lean.

Probably
same
Trump szn
He doesn't really do anything special. He just runs an algo based on polling data. So really he offers nothing more than the polls.

The fact that degenerate gamblers and bookies set better predictions is an embarrassment, tbh.
Good bot
Biden won New York right? Shouldn't that be worth more than Florida since it's the capital city?
They‚Äôll be fine, shit up like 2000% OTY so far

Probably celebrating
Bought UVXY $20 calls at noon. I'm feeling good vibes right now.
AMD gpus are the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù gpus. AMD has share in the console market too. AMDs cpu line is top notch theyre an awesome company. Nvidia has been in GPUs since the beginning of GPUs I believe. AMD has always been the underdog but theyre making a run over the last couple product line releases. The Ryzen chips set it off.  Thats my surface level analysis. Ive been holding 100 shares for a long time now.
Yes
Trump leading in Flordia, Ohio, and Michigan.
If he gets them, he is reelected.
Wow, just by reading this thread and not watching the news I can't figure out who's leading. My bet on a close, contested election is so far so good.
Lmfao ABC.... uhh uhh uhhh looks like trump might take Ohio we‚Äôll be back after this..... ‚ÄúOKAY GUYS WHAT DO WE DO NOW... STALL!! STALL!!! This is hilarious
lmao Trump wins Alabama. Big surprise
By god, that's Trump's music!!!!!
SPY 350 eow regardless of results

Weird futures
America got cucked by the leftist media

Lmao this was a landslide
Tell me how I held overnight for 40% sold in the morning today. Waited all day for a good price for re-entry, nothing happened. Said fuck it with a market order at like 359.
in the current climate you will be ostracized if you admit you voted for Trump. A friends brother literally cut off contact with him for over a month now because he's voting for Trump. And people are shocked that polls are off?
Which mushrooms will help me *taste* SPY calls?
It‚Äôs not about the language, but the conversation surrounding AI and other technological improvements. That conversation was laughable.

Agreed that Jack Ma is a very smart person, when it relates to business. Of course, AliBaba isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúnew‚Äù idea. It‚Äôs just Amazon copy pasted in China.
NASDAQ ü§ù
DXY moving like it‚Äôs TSLA. Scary.
Sweet home Alabama for papa Trump
The fuck!!! My portfolio is based on trump win
Just wait until Putin has his morning coffee big red
How many targets and Walmart‚Äôs get looted with mango win?
Trump is actually gonna win. The early voting was mostly democratic. Welp.

u know it, brutha
Can't believe it's all on PA and their 20 electoral votes gods
nah if people were this dumb theyll fall for it a third time
*We could win in Texas!*

Gets me everytime fam
If Ohio and Michigan end red, it‚Äôs gg
Or if trump does because people like the kind from r/politics will explode and storm the streets and probably make corona worse in the process
Post that in the election thread my guy

Never been there! I just know basketball is huge there.
Research Triangle for the win
Pennsylvania won't be counted until friday = bulls get rekkkkkddd
Mad respect to the futures traders, Id be paper handing all over the fucking place today.
Only thing markets dislike more then no free money is uncertainty.
Thank god I got out
Yeah Tech's done so well it made the fucking dow into a Tech index... really quite insane
Wait for a spy pullback and daytrade tf out of it
How are polls always so fucking wrong lmao I shoulda just bet on trump. Better return than weeklies
They were predicting like a 89% Biden win. Somebody fire this guy
betting lines have completely flipped.

About 3 hours ago $300 bet for joe biden to win was bet 300 to win 150. I just got another $300 bet in for biden and now odds have flipped and i bet 300 to win 550.

Have the odds really flipped that much? Is anyone realistically predicting trump takes it?
Why are futes blood green tonight you ask?

Biden believes in science üß™ üß¨ üß´ 

Technology üì± üíª ‚åöÔ∏è depends on science

Nasdaq IS technology üë∫üóø

Biden is winning BIGLY ü§ìü•≥ü§†

Therefore ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è Nasdaq FUTES blood green üìàüï∫üèøüìà
Turns out that screaming "Racist!" non-stop doesn't work
So trump winning is bad for Dow?

Is he gonna start busting out chasdaq 30k hats?
OH is gone Trump has taken the lead
NC is close Trump got that too
Holy shit there are going to be some very angry people tomorrow

Palantir wins no matter what
r/politics salty. Hard to believe those are real people.
I guess some large city is yet to report
So glad I bought last minute SPY puts eod
yeah but people on Twitter say Trump is racist so therefore how could old conservative minorities vote for him?
I love it here... we need to full send it tards, let‚Äôs get back to printing or burning tendies after the election like the degenerates we are
Snl viewers are the biggest todds of them all

Lmao sports books are pulling nearly all bets off the board üòÇüòÇüòÇ they know they‚Äôre fucked. Their books are probably loaded with trump picks
It's literally just trying to bring votes in for Biden to balance the payout book

Gee whiz bro
He keeps extending his lead as more votes being reported
They pop that limitless drug
bullish futures traders realizing the independent variable is DXY not price of SPX

Game over man!
I like Bloomberg.
The deregulation of banks, the corporate tax breaks, the low capital gains tax are all big factors. Also there has never been a president more proud of numbers in the stock matket more than the actual economy. He will not let it dump, period
can someone tell me how joe is winning virgina?
This thread is proving exactly why I bought vix calls.
But that‚Äôs no fun. I‚Äôm looking for a shitty 0.10 contract I can get 13 of.
Oregon is voting on decriminalization of shrooms as well. That state sounds like a lovely place to live
They are severely risk off
I‚Äôm not watching CNN. Even if mango loses Ohio he‚Äôs short
he would be escorted out, what do you think will happen
Imagine the cocaine right now with the big boy future traders. It's probably fuckn glorious
these pollsters should all be fired at this point, they are never right

Chances are not in your favor but I'm holding 500 shares so I really hope it prints for you
Why? Most of these red leaning states have very low percentage of votes counted

NC is lit, one of the best upcoming places in america imo
godamn trump is winning in ohio ! if trump gets ohio, he's the president , at least statistically all candidates who won it, were presidents
It‚Äôs almost like people don‚Äôt realize Hispanic and Latinos are a historically conservative culture
Yes, to both

Because if it's a close election, it opens the door for a drawn out contested election. This creates uncertainty and volatility. If it's a landslide win then it's much harder to legally fight and question the results.

Despite the username I'm not a big fan of either candidate but I sure as hell hate those fucks on that sub. Most miserable sexless cucks on the planet.

There was no healthcare plan 60mins to confirm.
sooo am I ditching TSLA for coal? lol
Holy shit as Trumps odds of winning increase the market is going red which makes no sense but ok
Just realized that I haven‚Äôt taken a shit today yet.  Farts are smelling ripe AF
But you can still touch her wiener right?

Also Biden is technically winning right now in Electoral votes, Trump was up earlier. Nasdaq was fucking ripping earlier.
Well I bought an 11/6 $9 put today because of unusual whales, so hopefully we can both be right
4 for 4 is too good of a deal to sustain profits. Puts

Damn PredictIt completely crashed, probably too many people trying to bet Trump
Ohio just flipped, the people are speaking
maybe my VIX calls will print tomorrow after all...
But it goes against the maxim of the non-aggression principle. Your right to swing your first ends at my face. BLM has been incredibly violent, they've killed people, caused billions of dollars in property damage, and their goals are in no way aligned with Libertarian ideals. I just don't see how *any* Libertarian could support them.

But, meh, it is what it is

Looks like this might payoff better than a Tesla FD
If you're confident enough people look at it as a free $50. I think the odds will swing back and forth throughout the night though. Lot of ups and downs. People live bet these things to find better value though

Some states (maybe all) have a tracking system so you know if your ballot has been processed at the post office and if it's been delivered to the counting location
Just make sure you stay far out with 45 days out.  It‚Äôs going to be a roller coaster
Two things.

First, if you are gonna get fucked, you already are -- can't really do anything about it now looking at futures like a retard.

Secondly, you had just as much chance getting ruined holding the call. IV crush is gonna eat them both for breakfast in pre-market cause you went long instead of selling a credit spread.

Now go back to the deck on your personal Titanic watching ES futures.
It's a false perception. The market has outperformed under Democrat presidents. Plus you can't discount the loss of US leadership around the world under Trump. This is a bigger issue to prevent China from taking the leading role.

Neither party nor President has the answer to our problems. The rest of the world has simply caught up to our manufacturing ability for the most part, though we still make the best of the best. No amount of fomenting war between USA and China can bring back their jobs. Tough situation.

This is projections from the AP. They have statistical models they adjust as  precincts come in and eventually it surpasses their confidence threshold to call it.

It also happens as the night develops they might reverse that, or say it's too close to call again

Donald Trump -220
Joe Biden +155
In Florida you get an email when your vote is received and counted. Took less than 48 hours for everyone I know. You can track and trace your ballot if for some reason you didn't receive your email confirmation.
Third party and write ins are the other 2%
$100 to win $200 if Biden wins
A lot of states have ballot tracking in place so you can see if your ballot was received and validated

DXY JUST BROKE 94 SHITTTT
Well, did you at least vote for him?
Same here, I‚Äôm about to just buy puts for everything I‚Äôm confident in.

Only the ones that's been called.
They are generally pretty good. They'll fuck with pre election polls but it looks really bad to mis-call the actual vote. Also New England went solid blue one minute after polls closed lmao

Small rural counties report very fast, larger metro areas take longer. Anticipating Biden votes in slower areas
Man...I love you homos...best source for news always lol
gotcha
Link? To the thread?
Okay honest question. I‚Äôm not saying that I think mail
in ballots are fraudulent or anything. But how can they say that it‚Äôs completely safe. I‚Äôve had my shit lost in USPS before, it just happens sometimes. How is this any different?
And the dems will protect it if that happens. Vice versa
If sleepy wins y‚Äôall think mango will still tell us his healthcare plan?

I think it‚Äôs you you have to pay 220 to win 100.

He was initially -160 or around there, so odds are moving in his favor
Bet 275 to win 100 for Trump vs bet 100 to win 225 for joe. 1:3 to win vs 2.5:1

Friend is a  Democrat council member for the local town in PA where he lives.  He worked the polls today.  He said there was a very intense turnout of Trump supporters for his supposedly Democrat township.  Granted, most Dems probably mailed in their ballots already, but he said do NOT count your chickens before your eggs have hatched.  The intensity of turnout of Trump supporters in PA caught the Dems off guard, according to him at least.
Looks like Biden lost this

You know shit isn't good for him when r/ politics isn't excited anymore
I don't get the political betting. Says if you wager 500 on a trump win you'd still lose money if he wins??
-200 means bet 200 to win 100
The way I have been picking stocks in the past few months 100% makes this true

Interesting, just curious why? better for me to understand from a local than read from articles.

Lmao market will tank if Biden wins dude
I believe it will

Fox News says that Democrats are expanding their House majority further even further than 2018, which was a huge blue wave.  It‚Äôs hard to deny that when Fox is saying it, given how bad it would be for them.  That should be reflected in the presidential votes as well, which we‚Äôre not seeing right now.  Some counties won‚Äôt even start counting mail-in ballots until tomorrow, and mail-in ballots lean Democrat.  It‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens over the next day or two.

It won‚Äôt. It‚Äôll be like Beto a few years ago. It‚Äôll be close but Trump wins by a small amount. However it helps since Biden seems to be winning more of the suburban vote in Texas which is good correlation for other states.
He‚Äôs closing the gap but it‚Äôs still big
Maybe the most ignorant comment in here, you know even Fox already reported democrats retained the house?
Here‚Äôs that volatility we‚Äôve been waiting for since Sunday futures. Strap in cocks.
Trump cucks in massive denial. So cringe and sad
Lol neither of them are competitors
The Texas "swing state" thing is mind boggling to me. Drive all around this state and you can tell the MAGA is skrong here. I don't think the analysts have a good grasp on that
I have been thinking about replacing my plastic food containers with glass ones since March. They say wait 30 days before making a large purchase so I went ahead and been waiting for more than 180 days. 

But yesterday I bought $4K worth of SPY FDs after thinking for like 10 seconds. Which I sold today at 1.4K loss after heavily DCAing

At what time I can go to bed knowing who won? Tired already.

Jack Dorsey said he can‚Äôt or he will post a tag on his post.
It's not an all-or-nothing situation. TX won't become CA overnight. First step is to get the Medicaid expansion passed; OK just passed it. TX marijuana laws are idiotic, those need to change. Get the QAnon, religious nut politicians out of there. Baby steps.
Lmao what? If TX goes blue election is over
Im still hoping for that Spy bloodbath.....

This is what I expect from wsb
Yeah man, I creeped all the way back from a 20K loss to just around 5K loss. After last week, I‚Äôm back down to 16K. It goes up slow but it falls pretty fast.
Whoever is winning right now, keep it up, my short calls love this shit

Wichita. I traveled around the country for 2 years and this is one of the cheapest, nicest cities I've found. Winters aren't terrible. Quiet and beautiful. Not the best economy, is one reason. Too dependent on aircraft manufacturing, but they're trying to to diversify. There's good coffee, booze, food in all the midsized cities now ala Tulsa, OKC, etc. I think my friends back in LA are totally insane, they could all retire and buy a nice house for 150k and work part-time at Walmart or something, but they're obsessed with 2 hour commutes, 1800 for a one bedroom and having sports teams, I guess. It's hard for some people to let go of that city pretentiousness. Now I just go visit NYC or some other cool city every few months when I want some excitement and come back to my 400/mo studio where I can watch eric andre and not kill myself to make rent.

Trump gonna lose those Midwestern states he won in 2016. That‚Äôll be the difference.

But by all means, let's ping u/Opinion_Is_Unpopular to adjudicate.
they're up, bonds have been completely obliterated, money is going into risk assets and yields are rising. We are moving up until de Fed steps in with more QE to lower yields, and then we will have another spike in bonds and probably a correction in equities.

I wish she‚Äôd get more recognition if for no other reason than at least to spread the concept of libertarianism (I am not one btw) or at the very least popularize the fact that there are more than two options
Looking at how the vote counting is going so far, looks like cities are getting their votes in first. Which is why Biden seems to lead early in states. Texas is a prime example. Most of geographic Texas isn‚Äôt even counted yet.
Isn't it close
Peri- is a prefix meaning near/around. So there‚Äôs pre, peri, and post.

Texas: we red
We've been red for years and we're known as the gun toting state for a reason.  The thing is we're so big we have some of the largest cities in the u.s.  Out of the top 14 cities we've got 5 of them.  That's big.  Multiple of those cities have more population than other states.  It would create the largest divide in the U.S. among rural and suburban people.  You'd see a lot of voter manipulation in the coming years to turn it back to red.

Twice a fucking week
With the electoral college those in underrepresented (and just as valuable) areas can have a larger say in the election and for good reason. Both groups of people are valuable and valid, but when those falling to the groupthink of big cities are the only ones who decide the election, then we have an enormous amount people who do not have their needs fulfilled.

> The chart isn't just an arbitrary line. AMD+Xilinx is not the same as AMD stocks plus Xilinx stocks.


i never said it was.

i said xlnx is no growth.  because they are.  hence, their lack of growth in their financials and chart being dead until the rumour broke.

you omit the issues with the overpayment and worse, the 1.72 tether (and subsequent dilution).

there's a reason why amd's sp went from 88 down to 74, amidst the best ER they've ever had (with beats on eps, rev, and guidance) and 2 major catalysts (zen3 and big navi).  without the xlnx deal, it would have rocketed to 100 and probably beyond.
Probably works on a subconscious level

I am a city slicker and although not liberal, probably far from being right-wing nutty enough for the poor rurals, but I get why they vote Republican. At least these folks had the pride of being the backbone of America. And then Dems roll in, and try to tell them that they are the problem with America. Wtf.

Dems still don't get that you are trying to win hearts and minds in elections, not make converts out of people by proselytizing. Ironic, coming from a now barely-Christian party.

what do you plan to do when market opens if biden wins? and if trump wins?
cause these retards refuse to answer. it is not priced in, hell not even intel losses are priced in yet. looking at least 2 yrs before its priced in. expecting market cap to double is probably an underestimation.
That looked weird to me as well. I guess it is based on which districts have reported and the performance relative to last time?

Yes and no. They wont liquidate all at once. However, dividend investing aint what it used to be. Gradually cashing out is pretty much the only way to consistently draw at the 3-5% they're set up for. Boomers need millennial money to keep pumping the deflating bubble. Wealth transfer is going to be bullux. Millennials, aka the damned generation, will finally see a real burst sometime around 2040-2050.  Then gens Alpha and Beta will fight a civil meme war over oil reserves directed by Z and funded by millenials who went cash gang just in time. Ironically TSLA will be the primary military vehicle supplier, this time with actual bullet proof windows.

Nvidia is a small asian man in a leather jacket that picked up a cheap hooker in Vegas (ARM) because they think that's what you're supposed to do when you're rich and powerful. They don't tell their wife because they don't want to admit they spent 4 hours watching softcore porn on cable before she took his money and left.
Unlikely, but remember that lots of people from California have been moving to Texas. If it stays blue (big if), then this over.

Yeah sure but for 50% to be unhappy that means an entire party (and some winners) would need to be sad about the result. I doubt any winners would be sad, and I‚Äôd be surprised if every voter in the losing party cared enough to be sad. All I‚Äôm saying is ‚Äúhalf‚Äù of America being unhappy would be surprising.

Look up how electoral college is calculated. It's all about population and where the lines are drawn.
It appeals to simpletons, that's why it works.  If everybody thought for themselves and, you know, did some research or read a fucking book once in a while, then the rallies would be pointless.
Of course they‚Äôre gonna count those ballots and make Biden win. People already have begun being investigated for mail-in ballot fraud dude. If they are a majority Biden that only shows that the mail in fraud was left-leaning. That means we literally have election tampering going on and it‚Äôs not from russia, but done here. It‚Äôs tampering with the vote count to make Biden win. That‚Äôs worse than russia paying for pro-trump facebook ads. Stimmy saved America so drumpf has my vote. Biden is a dimwit with every plan imo. But it‚Äôs super concerning to see that the media is overwhelmingly steering people to Biden, try to meddle with votes to have him in, social media is stifling republican posts and pushing left bs, and even the FBI is ignoring the shit on hunter biden just to get Biden in office. I get there‚Äôs corruption everywhere but to say they have the laptop and the files are on there, but the fbi says if any media posts any info with the files, they will be in trouble? U kidding? It was supposed to be a secret within the FBI till Rudy had whistleblowers tell him and he blasted it. FBI admits it‚Äôs real shit but sweeps it under the rug? Government is a corrupt joke, teenagers want socialism, and capitalist socialism is facism. They screech against facism. How many brain washed retards are there?

People who care at all about how people pronounce target to the degree that they could characterize them as assholes, are assholes.
If Trump turns California red you know it's over right?
Dude is the largest state. If any of the candidates win there, the other is fucked. Period.
I mean this as gently as possible, but get some help. If you need to move to the city, maybe that's for the best. It's just politics, at the end of the day. There's one thing certain, no matter who wins, and that's very little will change.

If your guy wins, great. If he loses, look forward to spending the next few years whinging and moaning as hysterically as possible (That's my plan, lol. It's great fun).

Oh fs

With Ohio blue its already not looking good for mango
That is true. I did not think about that.  But the markets should like 4 years of nothing getting done other than stimulus.
The race was tighter than a virgin's twat. Basically it call came down to Florida, which didn't get called till very early the next morning. Al Gore conceded. Then it turned out there were issues with voting (hanging chads, confusing ballots), questions over absentee ballots. Al Gore un-conceded. Legal battles back and forth all leading up to just a day or two before the electors meet. A 5-4 Supreme Court case (Bush v Gore) in favor of Bush. Al Gore concedes again.

We literally had no idea who the President would be until December.
That type of democratic strategy has already failed once.  Still feel they did enough to win this time though.
Duh. But that won‚Äôt happen
Yeah that would be a complete disaster for Republicans.
God you‚Äôre dumb
I expect ACB stock at 7 at open
Surprising that Biden is up so much in Ohio, North Carolina and Penn? Trump looking like a big win in Florida though.
Look, I know it hurts for you rural folks or conservatives, but EVs, clean energy, TSLA, NIO, TAN are all going to make us some serious tendies. You can‚Äôt fight the future. The green new deal will pull us out of this recession and will make us a manufacturing powerhouse.

Crowds at rallies are generally more indicative of the existing support and enthusiasm for a candidate rather than as an opportunity to persuade voters. For ex. in 2016 it was a big deal that Donny T was having huge turnout at his rallies because it showed that voters were way more enthusiastic about him than the media would've had you believe. It has less of an impact now though, because we have 4 years of information about how supportive his base is.
Joe winning?

You can bet on that?
Oh wow so brave, +1 virtue points to you good sir!!!
How do have they only 92 votes so far? It says 44 Biden 48 Trump this will take years and what happens if it takes longer than 4 years to count, do they vote again

TOUCH THE LEGS ON MY HAIR GOLD IT TURNS
It was always going to be red. Dems were delusional
You don't think that people are investing in this election?  This is the biggest turn out in decades.  I have to believe that this election is very emotional for people.
Let's face it, Biden would be coasting right now if he picked someone else, someone who wasn't so obviously a diversity pick and extremely reminiscent of the "Squad".

Dems ran a white woman in 2016 as president and lost, and figured that they might try to sneak in a half black woman as president in 2020 via the back door. Wtf were they thinking?

This coming from a guy who, overall, wants Biden to trounce the Orange Retard.
Watching spy futures now like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be so fucking rich‚Äù then 4 seconds later ‚Äúoh fuck I am going to be so fucking poor‚Äù to 5 minutes later ‚ÄúI am going to be so fucking something.‚Äù

Biden looks good once polls start reporting but then trump comes in hot as more votes come in. The narrative is that it's because of early voters ( most likely biden) being reported first. 

This is backed up by the odds swinging. Biden a gone from -200 to -145 in the last hour or so.  


Idk who's winning but it's going to be close in the swing states
Trump looking better

It's about perception.  "Oh wow, lots of people went to that xyz rally, must be a good candidate"

And the people who go to the rallies go home and talk about it to their friends and family.

Basically, if you're a moron that's impressed by shiny things, then you might be swayed to vote based on a rally attendence.
Permaban this guy's whole fucking family
Orange Juice futures is up .50%. It‚Äôs at $115.65 right now. Hell yeah.

I think a split President - Senate is really good for tech (since they can‚Äôt pass any legislation). But it‚Äôs terrible for IWM, since they also will have a tough time passing the stimulus. 

Or maybe it‚Äôs just your round of the mill rotation back into tech and the election is just noise...like tech had been underperforming since last Wednesday and we‚Äôve seen this story a lot.
This is the way

Yes! That green candle is saying something.
There is a 100% chance he will lose the popular vote. This was never even really a question. He lost by 3 million votes last time, lol. Republicans haven't won the popular votes in decades, except for the one Bush election after 9/11

The question is whether he can find a way to pull of an electoral win again.
I dont agree, why would oil be up for the last day if the market thought Biden would win?
Brrrrrrrr... sorry what?
Love you mango man.. but you gots to go
so you just bought them EOD ?
if I'm not mistaken, the popular vote never has and never will mean shit right? I mean democrats have won the last 5 out of 6 popular votes right? 

Electoral votes are where it counts. There's a reason why the right hired academics to create gerrymandering and map out counties and complicate the fuck out of things.

I mean shouldn't we maximize the opinions of the most people though? As it stands, California and New York votes don't matter. There will always be votes that don't matter. The idea is just to maximize how many people have an impact. If everyone has an equal vote, then it would maximize happiness. I'm also in support of a ranking system.

Meh, at least you have your education, career, and retirement funds to fall back on.
Don‚Äôt be a smart ass, you know all of our burgers come that way.
Not that it doesn't have it's flaws but if we went straight majority vote then Dallas county alone could outvote the entirety of the 4 least populous states. At that point where's the point in voting if you don't live in California, Texas, or New York? There isn't one. With a majority vote, you straight up eliminate the voices of practically the entire midwest/west
It's awful, but it depends if you are poor or not poor. The bay area is great.

I know it's early, but Trump leading the popular vote is concerning. If Trump remains a contender, it's going to be a long night...and worse, more instability going forward. Biden will almost certainly win if all the mail in votes are counted, but if Trump ends up ahead (or at least very close) tonight, then expect a big fucking fight.

So far, reporters are acting like all the key states might be able to be decided tonight.  But my state (Michigan) claimed they may not know until Friday (if it‚Äôs close).  I have to imagine that ONE of the 4 ish key states will be too close and not able to call until after 9:30am tomorrow (probably Thursday or Wednesday night depending on the spread).  &&& as long as this feels to you, it feels even longer to those trying to limit risk and decide policies for their entire corporations.  If it drags out, it‚Äôs crashing bad.  If it‚Äôs not a landslide victory (in the electoral college, not popular vote) then either candidate can fight the result or both claim victory or blah blah blah.  People hate that. 


So decent odds for you.  I would say 35%.  Praying may help lol - but don‚Äôt pray for money & don‚Äôt pray to money lol
Was just singing Old MacDonald‚Äôs Farm to my toddler and when we got to sheep and it was BABA here and BABA there, I started crying about my calls.
For people who werent watching the markets 4 years ago, when Trump got elected futures sold off hard and then we had a massive bull market. Sure it was a surprise win but my point is that tonight‚Äôs futures are even more meaningless than a typical nights futures. We will just see more volatility for a bit and then stonks go up.
They would and they know it

Check in at 11pm this is mostly meaningless bullshit until at least then
Very true. Here in Texas though early voting will make a huge, huge difference. I still expect my state to go red, but with so many mail-in‚Äôs the result could be unforeseen
There‚Äôs also a really high correlation between Ohio and Pennsylvania. Even if Trump wins Ohio, if it‚Äôs by a smaller margin than expected, that‚Äôs good for Biden‚Äôs PA chances (since Biden has a larger urban vote there vs Ohio).
Election would be so much more fun if the markets were open

Not looking good for Donnie
Being leader of planet earth sorta fits with his personality type.
Imagine being bullish
Trump going to win boys, place bets accordingly
Would Dems be screeching about the electoral college if that happens like they have been for 4 years
Trump will turn to dementia don if he loses the election. The amount of stuff he won‚Äôt be able to recall will be tremendous.
I live in Florida and it was hilarious to even think Trump was going to lose Florida. People have no common sense

This is such a stupid sentiment though. Californians that move to Texas vote red because they were pushed out of California!
How dare the minorities vote against their masters, Hahahaha.
Voted for trump but honestly thinking this election will swing in Biden‚Äôs favor ngl
It‚Äôs better to vote on principle than to sell out
You know what they say about a fool and his money.

People only move out of Cali because its property values are too high. They then go to shithole red states that have cheap property because their economy is trash.

Edit:
Contribute the same amount per capita to the federal budget as California does and I won‚Äôt call red states shitholes.
Erection. It‚Äôs spelled erection.
I believe if the margin of victory is within half a percentage for any one state, it‚Äôs an automatic recount
She can do it!
Every time a republican has lost Ohio they have lost the presidency(puts on dementia don)
Honestly,  democrats fukked up again picking up status quo with biden.   Pick someone original dammit
Fuck if Biden losses he‚Äôll die if he wins he‚Äôll die
What‚Äôs pumping rn?
We‚Äôre getting stimmy regardless.

I‚Äôm interested to see how many Californians voted Trump.  A lot of us did and there were good rallies.  Clearly Biden but still...
Why are you surprised
Its early
Keep Austin weird
I was surprised how mild the market was today

I don't know who to hate more - sleepy Joe, or Obese Trump - both are a laughingstock, and they represent the worst of America. At least Trump is the physical manifestation of a vast majority of Americans - obese as fuck.
Sorry to hear it

So has anyone looked at NQ futures? It literally does not care (it was up earlier too even when Biden looked in better shape). I have mostly tech calls and I‚Äôm hoping for a rotation back into tech after last week‚Äôs disaster.

I wish this thing would hurry up, and also go my way.  I have some text messages I have been waiting a long time to send.
There may be one on the moon thats neutral
Blue senate conversion will make it easier for the stimmy to pass, that's what the market cares about most short term
They also said Arkansas is too close to call üòÇ

That's anecdotal as fuck

capital gain tax? I k it‚Äôs ok for this sub
Mail-in votes are all blue.
China wants Trump to win, they don't want to deal with someone new. Trump has costed China nothing,  he has no international support. Biden can actually get EU on board to counter China together. All Trump does is talk, the EU isn't with him

Trump was up 300k voters when they called it for Biden, that was a head scratcher. He‚Äôs probably gonna take it once NOVA reports but still
BET
I know we're all expecting Trump to be the one to put up a legal fight to question the results but Biden also has 600 lawyers on standby so if he starts challenging the results maybe that will be the wild card to finally drop this ridiculous market rally or atleast save my VXX calls lol

He can't win without it. I mean unless he like flips new York or California or something, lol.
All these people wanting to know if Texas is gonna flip, no buddy it‚Äôs not. Look at Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. These guys are gonna decide everything

Mods are gay. No one word
Honestly, I think the biggest move we'd get is if Trump gives a speech late tonight or turns to Twitter and basically says he's not conceding and he's going to contest the election. That will send VIX through the roof.

It's gonna happen by 2024-2028 but yeah too early this time around

In Texas, Biden is leading trump by very very small margin but the problem is most of the votes are from Huston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin and Corpus Christi. Once we move rural then fireworks begins.
Bears are gunna eat shit tomorrow
Did some math. You are right it would be 272-266 (Nebraska changed their system so Biden gets a vote there). I forgot about Arizona when I was adding up the points. So yes I guess Trump needs to win every single state he won in 2016 except those 2.
Maybe friendship was the 10 bagger all along

I don't know, I could see a "markets rally on recount hope" and it wouldnt surprise me
MSM not even trying to hide their biases right now with how they‚Äôre covering the election
Big blue areas reported first.
some grain of truth in this, they are very big on how they are perceived
Penn Station
McConnell is to stimulus as ... Trump is to paying taxes
Also calls on Dell.
Not if trump takes Florida
With a name like that she should be...
If Biden wins, he's definitely getting his d-ck sucked.  I'll do it if nobody else is going to step up.
Imagine thinking Amy McGrath would happen - probably NKLA bulls
Prepare for thy downvotes
Mod voted for Mango

Puts on Biden
Trump really made up 10% in Miami-Dade off Lil Pump
I have some gold! Is it good??
.... and you thought they wouldn‚Äôt on a night of this magnitude?
triggering ptsd, where's my safe space?
I know we're all expecting Trump to be the one to put up a legal fight to question the results but Biden also has 600 lawyers on standby so if he starts challenging the results maybe that will be the wild card to finally drop this ridiculous market rally
They‚Äôre super liberal down there, like Austin Jr. these days.
I lived in San Francisco for a half decade. People there are unbelievably stupid, even the "educated" ones who work at the big tech companies.

And? I'm trying to hear about the election right now, not fucking lizard people and aliens and shit smh
I can‚Äôt wait to see the libtards SCREECH over at politics
Futures are fucking crazy
Stop pushing the Texas blue narrative
You moron, Selling on the news would be selling when he actually gets sworn-in during January.
Yep and the first one is pronounced "Kan-saw".
Biden -170 Trump +140 now
I‚Äôm not saying the polls are right, but you can‚Äôt draw a conclusion about national polls based on a +/- of 3-4 in one state...  literally the margin of error.
Plenty of morans with a college degree

Amazing, I hope they‚Äôre all weeklies :D
Florida for Trump is a huge race, especially the big win, shows polls may be off in many other states
Unless Ohio goes Biden.

Then it's over.

There's literally no path to a Trump victory without Ohio.
RIGGED
Lol it‚Äôll be the same as before the election...

Honestly I want this just to watch the epic meltdown from trump not understanding why he loses despite having won the same way

Although this may seem closer than what ppl thought, I think there is no way Trump wins PA. 
And if he loses TX that‚Äôs like the Republican apocalypse.
TBH if Dem lost this election, it prob because of not accepting the 1.8 trillion dollar package. Lot of my friends got urk by that even though they are going to vote blue anyway
Whats the score
Lol wow San Antonio full Biden now
This market has been selling on the news , if trump doesn't win there will be a sell off
In terms of calling elections, you can.

Going into this it was projected he would lose by 2 points, he's going to win by 2+. That just means the polling in the rest of the country is wrong too. Not good for Sleepy Joe!

Yeah, lets send the military on your own citizens. You follow QAnon too?
If Biden wins Texas it would be truly retarded and typical of 2020. How the fuck can you lose Florida but win Texas a historically strong Republican state.
If Ohio goes blue trump is done for imo
Which is the best station to watch the elections, which is unbiased??
I wouldn't be surprised at this point.
biden is going to take TX fool
Shouldn't affect ITM options as much. Also if the elections are contested, then IV crush ain't gonna happen either
There‚Äôs a 0% chance that Texas goes to Biden

Trump taking all the fat, sleeveless hillbilly states. Who'd have thunk?
Uncounted counties are super liberal

Dumb ass Californians ruined their own state with homeless and debt.  Then proceed to move to Texas and continue to vote the exact same way. Since what do they care,  they got a house paid off and a telsa.  Nothing better to virtue signal til they ruin the next city.  They are like locust lol.

yeah i mean i don't disagree but i think objectivism deserves at least a little bit more consideration than it's typically given. i don't think it should really be considered an entire philosophy for the reasons you stated like it's short sightedness but i don't think it's entirely different than adam smith's invisible hand. she seems to actively disavow greed rather than argue in favor of it like you're suggesting which is part of where i think people misunderstand her.

i'm not even saying i agree with objectivism, but i think it's a valuable concept as a thought experiment if nothing else
Yeah, they're basically making a call based on turnout predictions in un-reported blue counties.

Yeah her opponent dropped out after going through a divorce and getting threatened. He‚Äôd never run for anything before

Democrats failed to unseat McConnell. If they fail to unseat Graham and Trump after spending shit load of money (which could have been better spent on YOLO trades in this sub), the entire Democratic leadership needs replaced. Incompetence should not be rewarded
Texas is the state where trumpers literally tried to kill someone in broad daylight and nothing happened so you tell me

Until a month ago it moved with TSLA and Nasdaq. Now it just moves up

Apparently Virgina was called for Biden by the associated press with only 32% votes in? Probably bugged
Still close. 

NY Times had projected if Biden wins any/either FL, GA, or NC, he is most likely the winner and it would be decided quickly. Right now he is not favored to win any. So it is still a toss up.[Here is their Live probability needles ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/forecast-president.html) for each of those three states. If these three go Red, it‚Äôs anybody‚Äôs game.

If one went Blue, likely Biden victory over all

Yea Biden was slow to counter that
suck a big fat green you gei bear.

For sure man. Wish we could get a younger candidate. I think we will see a big change in the coming years
i know. wtf is everyone talkin about?
Bull trap confirmed.
Oh yea message was from business insider. A reputable American news source from Germany

Lol Trump gonna lose Texas??
Yeah.
It's amazing how many people go out and make the effort to vote, before literally throwing their time down the drain.

-.4% is nothing son. That is the market waiting for big green or big red
Calls on Trump killing himself after losing Texas and Carolina
There‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs close rn is it?
Companies basically gave people the day off.

BIGLY
Can‚Äôt you‚Äôve already nutted. Only the pure can meat the mighty macadamia
I just chose it because it looks cool
The funny thing is that I'm not even American. I don't really care who wins, Trump just makes more headlines in the news so I've been entertained these past 4 years.
He wasn't ever going to win that state.
A put for December?! That's not how we play SPY around here...
 It's almost there's a major volatility event going on after a huge unexplicable Trump 

There I fixed it for you.
liar
Quite the master at fucking shit up that guy.
Large futures swings. While most of us waste our time consuming media, the futures gang is either making a killing or losing it all.
That‚Äôs what you deserve if you voted trump lol.
I thought we were getting a woman president in 2016, instead we got a mentally handicapped president and I was like, "Only in America."
Is there a scenario where mango man wins and we dump
Tomorrow
Puts on work productivity tomorrow
Thanks 

So it's still close or can go to contested ?
If Trump wins FL and loses TX then I don‚Äôt know wtf to make of all this.
‚ÄúOmg futures up 1% game over 5% game on spy tomorrow 400 eom - kill yourself you gay fucking aasholes you hate America  maga forwrver hrr drr drr‚Äù - everyone 1 hour ago
I have voted to restore it.
Including you ü§°
Anyone got a link to that guy on MSNBC panicking in 2016 when Trump won and trying to figure out how Hillary can still win?
I sold 323 puts for tomorrow
Of course WSB go with the dying retard. Inverse üçä 2020
He's going to send in the national gaurds
If Trump wins everything he did in 2016 except Ohio and NC he wins 273 to 265.
Lol they still exist?
Futures are too high imo
Are you implying the big cities are more red than the other parts?
This discussion thread is as high energy as Jeb Bush
I‚Äôve got more faith in Biden winning Texas then Florida tbh, I figured Florida was going to go red af with all those anti-socialist ads they were running
If Trump takes Michigan this gets interesting
To buy TSLA calls, I think. But I'm no professional
TX on Deck!!! LOL
God damn
If you don‚Äôt vote for Donald trump you ain‚Äôt white

The real market determination depends on if they can call a clear winner tonight or tomorrow.  


The market HATES the unknown. If there‚Äôs not a clear winner tonight, the market is going to tank. 


If there is a clear winner tonight, it doesn‚Äôt matter who, the market will go up (give & take certain sectors obviously). 



All in all, you have a small chance if the presidential race is still looking like a coin toss tomorrow at 9:30am

Dems likely reverse the bans on Chinese tech
I've been trading since 2006 and these are the flattest futures I've ever seen on an election night.
No way, Dems want to increase corporate taxes and lock down the country. I want Biden to win, but I know Trump is better for the market

It‚Äôs way too early. Only states called so far for each candidate were expected to go as they did. Florida is the first toss up state it looks like is going to Trump. That‚Äôs 1 battleground state

Not judging here at all. but Google the projections and it will help keep score. Right now the map looks like it was ‚Äúexpected‚Äù to (except FL toss up now being Trump)
PA is not looking good for mango at all
Texas is a battleground, and been slowly gaining for dems. Next election, Texas has a good chance of winning for the dems.

I think its the opposite of what people think - if Biden wins I think bull run / bubble will continue, and if Trump wins well go Bear and pop!

Ohio not looking good
Why is s&p so detached from nasdaq right now
Maybe because the Ayn Rand philosophy is demonstrably short sighted. Think about how interconnected the world is-now more than ever.  Everything we or other countries do ultimately affects everyone. Pure unchecked capitalism that rand championed ends up with results like Somalia. Her ‚Äúobjectivism‚Äù philosophy has been lampooned by critics countless times for more reasons than I‚Äôm going to list on wallstreetbets. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù it‚Äôs just a shallow selfish sophomoric way of thinking. It‚Äôs ok to look out for yourself and to be greedy sometimes. If everyone did it all the time we would be ferengi and it‚Äôs stupid to want to live in a society like that.

I feel like back to back elections the Dems have nominated the _only_ candidates that wouldn't beat Trump
I joined a FB group where people pretend to be an Ant colony and it is the funniest shit ever. They post a picture of like fruit and people comment on it ‚ÄúYUM‚Äù and ‚ÄúNOM‚Äù and ‚ÄúEAT‚Äù. Or a picture of a magnifying glass and they say ‚ÄúATTACK‚Äù or ‚ÄúBITE‚Äù.

You should. If you didn‚Äôt, that would be concerning.  However, just remember that it‚Äôs going to suck, but it won‚Äôt really matter much for very long.  Obviously the repercussions won‚Äôt be undone, but in awhile they won‚Äôt impact your day to day. 

In a couple of years, it probably won‚Äôt even matter (besides the occasional reminder from friends and family lol).  You might always regret it, but it won‚Äôt always suck as much as it does fresh.  We all regret things we did (or didn‚Äôt do), they don‚Äôt have to ruin our lives or cause us daily misery.  But the short term won‚Äôt be fun.  

Chin up & just remember that it‚Äôs just numbers on paper.  People here have spent more than that on cocaine and hookers, if you learn something from it (obviously it wasn‚Äôt investing), then you‚Äôre further ahead than them.

Got my M1 Abrams Tank ready here in nyc.  But i got it a long time ago cuz of the potholes
Hurray for a child that makes it through
I always knew there were hidden Trumpers everywhere
!remindme 12 hours
Is NiO considered tech?
If Trump actually wins, as it looks like rn, you american guys living be safe and keep your family safe from any bullshit violence that erupts as a meltdown. Best wishes from Asia....
The market is so unpredictable, I too thought it would drop at least 10% during election week...but I didnt buy any put options after I got anal raped during the summer rally. GG

Stupid, fake ass market. I hate this shit so much.
This, this gave me a good chuckle
I dont know what all the shoutin was about - it's the exact same race as 2016
Nice lineup.
Oilers you mean.
Yang had some good ideas, Pete is a joke.
This is like when people on r/sportsbook call a game over in the first 5 minutes lol
[deleted]
Who?
Dale!!!!
Oh ok that makes sense. Basically some states are fixed Democrat or Republican states so you can account for a certain number of guaranteed votes from these states. Other states flip flop depending on the candidate they prefer and some like Florida and Pennsylvania have a good amounts of vote to get you closer to the 270 needed to win.
Futures kinda batty tonight.
Maybe you two guys should meet up and jerk each other off onto those guns
You guys are funny. 0.66% isn't bloody red.

Where were you in March? THAT was bloody red.
[removed]
Gonna get drunk tonight and fuck the gf. Between you guys, imgur and the memes. I don't give a fuck who wins. Having the time of my life with you degenerates. Calls on friendship
Futures now thinking there's gonna be a shit show.
CNBC mostly avoids shilling for either side. Hiring Shephard Smith sealed it. He was one of the better straight news anchors on any network.
BERNIE CAN STILL WIN!!! HERE'S HOW:
Gap, yeezys, and mental illness for everyone
Lol
You're not wrong. 1/2" CD upwards of 900m a few weeks back.
This is not a surprise tho.

If Biden wins Texas there's going to be civil unrest.

Where‚Äôs Alex Jones?
Chiraq
Change your attitude... You made a bad decision and lost numbers. Rethink your angle of attack and creep back.
That's what I'm doing... Creeping back with very small gains weekly. It's hard but I'm goin up past 25k now so at least I can day trade.
Good luck brother!
Why the fuck is the nasdaq pumping

Mad premature ejaculation in here
Looks to be true

As a swiss the US presidents of the past 20 years have had zero influence for my daily life. So i really don‚Äòt care who wins tonight as long as a civil war happens.
I sold today waiting for a dip.
Lmao "Theyre more educated so not Donald Trump voters". Coming from a right wing guy as well.

For people of wsb that are currently blindfolded biden is currently 30 points and trump 37 üá∫üá∏
Thank you, Chimpu

Futures say you're good to go brother
You know most of Democrats called Florida trump right?
Yep. The suburbs weren't buying that shit at all
Holy shit Trumps gonna win
lol
It's kind of a cult how popular he is.  Bush wasn't even this popular among the Republicans.
[deleted]
You must clearly not understand how anything works.
This hits too close to home. You're probably right. But life was so much better before Trump took office.
Its P/E is 80, it's pricing in the second coming at this point
**Tracking the mood today:**

Biden wins a landslide 

Biden is winning by bigger numbers than Hillary

Biden is still winning by double digits in the polls

Biden is still winning all the swing states

Bide is still winning

Independents will break massively for Biden

Biden is behind in a few states but still has a clear path to victory

Biden can still win on election day

Biden can still win without Florida

Biden can still win without Pennsylvania

*Biden can still win with late ballots* ‚è™‚óÄ‚¨Ö <--‚è™ **We are here right now**

Biden ca still win with the recount

Biden can still win with the Supreme Court

Harris will win in 2024
I trade out if it starts going the other way. So far, that hasn't been the case. üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Damn MI just went big red
Biden did worse than Hillary in Florida
How did Biden win Virginia could someone please enlighten me? It says that its only 28% reported with Trump leading 59.5% to 38.7% and somehow Biden won the electoral votes. Im so confused
Interesting. Zaxby's?
I voted for him earlier today it felt great, man I hope I get to see all the libs have breakdowns and cry again lol https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wDYNVH0U3cs
It‚Äôs not too late, if you‚Äôre long term you can easily double your money in a year or so.

It's up to PA now
last one is a sure bet
Probably back when he was a kid there it was very different. But also he needs to connect to the voters.
That‚Äôs like me switching between the election and daily moves threads
Who wants to go out and kick some ass?
Ggez only
FLORIDA Called for mango!
Tech really out here trying to save the whole market
Bro same! Except I went to prison for half a decade after my homeless junkie stint. Now I'm making 6 figures a year and have a quarter of that figure in a portfolio. People change and grow. Not everyone, but some of us.
Coporations come and go.
sell the news me hopes
It‚Äôs a shame
Rank choice
Lmfao it starts already
Biden lost Florida it‚Äôs over gg
No if Biden wins Ohio, he wins the election. There‚Äôs basically no path for Trump to win if Biden wins Ohio.
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

BLM fucked Biden
One of them is wrong
regardless who's winning, I'm getting high tonight
Hey, I'm pro biden, but you can never.
That is the ultimate truth.
When's the last time a president lost Florida but won election..... 

Doesn't look good. Puts on Biden.
Futures drunk af
It's based on two things:

Projections, they kind of extrapolate from the votes they already have

And

Historical precedent. SC was *always* going to go for Trump. They're *always* red, lol. 

And maybe also some wishful thinking.
Why? It's basically flat.
You‚Äôre going to jail. Puts on your heterosexuality

Jeez sounds kinda fishy idk.
Looks like it.
it blows my mind that there are millions of people who actually vote for Trump lmao what a time

Lol. A pajama trader gatekeeping WSB? Yes sir/ma‚Äôam
Bc without it Trump guaranteed loses. Now that he's winning, he's still got a decent (but not favored) chance
Buy calls because employee compensation is up. TLDR, Gamestop is having a tiktok competition for 100 bucks and/or? 10 work hours. Big employee appreciation there
Two party system is broken. No one was inspiring this time around.
Was trading in 2009-2019 just straight easy mode? Looking at the SPY max chart it looks like it went straight up except for that big dip in 2018.
Imagine thinking Florida or Virginia will vote blue

why? Isn't low taxes and low regulations best for companies and hence stocks?
Trump is gonna win Florida and probably Georgia. However, what if Biden randomly wins Ohio, which was projected for Trump.

The big toss up states left are Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, and maybe Ohio and Texas. Might be misremembering a state so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

fuckkkkk meee this shit is getting scary
I went up 100% the last two jumps. Both times it‚Äôs dipped, but not by a significant margin. If I waited for the dips I would have made way more. It‚Äôs always a risk to wait for one, but it‚Äôs trended this way several times already.
Nice man. Was looking at Canada iShares this week
I mean they were just waiting for election didn't they ? Now we will see stimulus as per Trump's wishes, House won't have much of bargaining chip

Yo what news station you guys watching the erection on?

Smh Bitch McConnell is gonna win
Pull him out Apoc
Except Nebraska district 2
Shoulda kept my puts fuck
The remaining counties that have a lot of votes to be counted in Florida - any one have any idea what the demographics are like?
Should have got in early, those cars looks slick as well.
Considering that was 2 months ago yes.

My bad, Nebraska and Maine confused me
I don‚Äôt even know who I‚Äôm rooting for
Ill trade u, tired of fake city problems would rather have real stick problems
Almost assuredly
mango has to win texas

if joe wins 38+55 thats like 1/3 the needed votes
Whatever, McConnell is slipping in the shower before the end of the year.
Not with a blue house, as you‚Äôve seen these past few months.
at least he's handsome
Alaska they love him
This sub is definitely one of the most conservative on reddit
It's going down for real
Not if he wins FL
are you like 16 years old or something
Lol

Mitch McConnell giving a big fuck you to everyone who hates him

He needs North Carolina to win comfortably, but yeah you're right
CAnt we just have a clear winner pleeease
This thread is so much more fun than /r/politics.

It's like watching water boil, cept it's chlorine and you might get chemical burns.
Imagine taking stock advice from someone who calls them evaluations
lol
What will be the first state that Kanye wins?
My fiance is stressing bigly. She's not a big don fan. Need Joe to pull it out or i'm gonna be stuck banging my right hand for the next month
I still don't know who the market wants to win but I'm guessing it doesn't matter that much.
Red or Blue fuck the electoral college, one person one vote
Imagine thinking Florida man supports sleepy joe
Lol, the classic ‚ÄúTrump mooning in FL‚Äù.

Makes no sense nothing is happening in rl
That's only the consensus because the people who decide the consensus are anti-Trump. Bidens taxes will kill companies long term.
how am I gonna sleep tonight wtf
Some poor trader in Japan just sat down late for work, hungover and looked at his screen and realized it was the US election and shit is about to get weird
Nio was much better up 1% AH 30 mins ago
Big life changes for me if Trump wins. Life is near intolerable as it is already. Four more years will break me. Might move to a big city. Be near people. The sticks are too isolated.
Better than 80% of 'Fund managers'.
I‚Äôll let you know in the morning
What sucks is it‚Äôs the fucking electoral college not out votes
I can call California for Biden with 0 percent of vote counted.

I think they called Trump for Florida
Lot of latinos believe voting trump is the macho man thing to do regardless of what he says, and macho man culture is extremely strong
Nope
You know i think the best part about this political thread is that both pro biden and pro trump things get upvoted as long as theyre well thought out or obviously satirical. Its when people post political bullshit that things get downvoted so everyones just enforcing the rules as a community from all sides. This has been another gay i heart wsb post
Wait what
FL to trump.
by who?
Not sure if commuting by helicopter to work or homeless by end of week =/
How the fuck is trump losing Texas.  Like that screams Republicans and guns and shit
Way too close.

Lol.... It's not that I'm pissed because "oh no my candidate is losing."

It's just wtf... How does this inspire confidence in the system? 

For all the shit they talked about trump hurting the system, still, every fucking year we see this and it DOES NOT inspire confidence.
>i'm so confused... is biden good or bad for markets?

THIS IS FINANCE NOT POLITICS WITH RANDOM DOLLAR NUMBERS
I think the most telling thing about the futures tonight is that when everything was up big early on, the Nasdaq was lagging the Dow and S&P. Now with them down, the Nasdaq is holding on more than the other two. Tells you about what people think depending on who gets in.
Invest in plywood for windows
This is the best. Remember when every liberal downvoted me when I said trump was going to win üòÇ

What‚Äôs this main stream news you read?

No people don‚Äôt want rioting/looting so they vote for Trump
Obviously Biden isn‚Äôt going to win Florida, but you‚Äôre posting shit like this while I guarantee ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is in your vocabulary.

i'm so confused... is biden good or bad for markets?
Why is AP results diffetent from what CNN and others are reporting
Lmao nice, let‚Äôs see that print screen
Bullish for our crippling US budget. You can make money in both markets, just be better.
It‚Äôs like calling a game after the first touchdown lol
That's why you don't watch biased news.

Your billionaire boy bloomy:

> It‚Äôs possible that neither candidate reaches the 270 electoral votes needed to win by the end of election night.
MMA is about speed and flexibility. Dude can't walk down a ramp
AP is calling races and has a lot more data at hand than you counting reported votes.
Oil industry is depleted. Fracking is all but dead. Oil prices are in the toilet.

My college roomy who is sell side analyst covering energy industry cries to sleep every night
Definitely not RH. It's TDA.
So true
those are odds
No way Biden wins GA.  Total bullshit.
this sub will be fine
xD.
Some people on the internet has been trading so madly that they kinda forgot the basic idea behind investing.
1 day chart ü§£
wonder what the race would look like if dems werent so lazy and voted in person
did futures tank when florida results came through?
What channel y‚Äôall watching? I keep bouncing between CNN and Fox News. CNN guy basically trademarked the phrase ‚Äúsuburbs are where the math is‚Äù and Fox News guy can‚Äôt do math.
So, you think that rioting and looting demonstrates that he has support?
Thank you man. You‚Äôre very smart!
dude we were literally making jokes about this when tesla split...
Michigan, Wisconsin & Pennsylvania are the key states
I dont work at wendys but I did get their breakfast alot when it first came out nationwide. Its alright. The sausage is nice and spicy. Biscuits a little dry and their bacon egg and cheese biscuit got nothing on McDonald's. I expect it to go flat, maybe slight upside if breakfast went well, but from what I saw it wasnt anything surprising.
Trust me, I did...

Doesn‚Äôt matter to theta gang though. They want neither side to print.
Anyone figured out what the market wants ?
SPY red. VIX red. What is this witchery
That‚Äôs the most American thing I‚Äôve seen so far. üç∫ üç∫ üç∫
Biden cal literally loose the entire south east and win y‚Äôall needa chill
Quit being stockcist
They shouldn't be..cause the Trump train don't stop baby. Trump me the fuck up and shower me in downvotes baby!
This whole thing will end up as a huge ass nothing burger if we get trump back, red Senate as it was and blue house. That would cause a red day on both SPY and VIX as it's just nothing different from what we already had.
all this movement and futures still basically flat
Lol true
Trump taking a slightly larger lead in FL
Winner winner chicken dinner üòÇ
he got until 11/13.  anything can happen..lol
Markets are too thin. That gap would narrow quick if any big money came in.
No shame in voting for the smaller piece of shit

How was the market 4 years ago today?
Got 'em!
I laughed at how you genuinely countered his comment
Mango Gets FL and Georgia?
[removed]
But what if?  I‚Äôd love to see all my neighbors pissed
watching r/politics is like watching futures right now lol.  every micro change people freaking out
Guys, I was banned from r/politics by writing: "Thank god, 4 more years of Trump. God bless America!" I also got 100 downvotes in 2 minutes, that's crazy.
Lowkey want mango to win again, just to see how this sub reacts.
I dunno man something about Kanye West, I think he is running for president
So even if trump has 60% of the votes, biden just won some key areas within virginia?
Holy shit Texas is blue af
[deleted]
Is biden from fucking scranton?
So many people are so stupid that they think the market will go green if their guy wins.
Hey there‚Äôs still come money left, lose it all or trade your way to WSB Valhalla
Exactly. Bro. Volatility is our friend.
its gonna be a tie until big dick cali drops trow
I think futures want Biden to win lol
are you delusional? trump has basically won florida biden isn‚Äôt gonna win texas
Texas will not be blue. They love their oil.
Not really though? Biden still has a clear path to 270 without either...
Was just gonna say the same thing

Bruh... this isn't the primaries. It's winner take all
Can't wait to pick up my Free PS5 if Donnie wins the election
Something like that
Not true. Biden camp never counted for those states., They are counting on Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania
BLUE growing on graph
When we find out this whole time the market was controlled by this French bulldog.
Dems have gained 3 seats in the senate so far. Stimmy coming baby.
At least futures are showing what people have been saying for a while.

Biden is a bull for markets. Trump is a bear for markets. Can't ask for a clearer sign than the reality of the futures market.
Say it agin?
Lets get more comments than in the daily thread
Love it when they show a state, "\_\_\_\_ winning big in Georgia"

24,000 votes counted
These futures are wild man
The panhandle is last to report and will be solidly red. Betting markets say Trump has Florida in the bag.
And just like that back to green
lol more like Ohio, he needs to wins those
Anddd futures back green üòÇüò´
It might be like last time where it dumps insanely hard at open and then ends on a rally lol
Kerry was taller he lost to bush
Crayola

Why does google have IL blue won? Nothing has been reported
Biden's voters will be working at the bank that repos your rented rawries.

Oh no. I accidentally held.

Jeff bezos wont care who wins. He will pay 0 tax either way üòÇ XD
We are in a simulation, or a giant MEME I dunno
What makes you say that because the literal votes say it‚Äôs close
Personally I‚Äôm a long time NIO investor and very bullish with the company. Here‚Äôs why:

It's looking really good for them. Several financial firms have upgraded their forecasted market value for NIO. Made a lot of headline news from the upgrades. This is what's causing the boom right now. Other things NIO has going for them..

1. China has more people who drive than there are people in the United States. Having a huge consumer market without even going international. If they go international shares will double again. 

2. The Chinese Government is requiring that 25% of all vehicles are EV by 2025. By 2040 or 2050 banning all combustible engines. 

3. A huge pension fund just sold their Apple and Intel stock to buy NIO. Source: https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-sold-apple-stock-intel-bought-nio-zoom-video-51604003963

4. They are upping their production levels from 50k a year, to 150k next year. 300k in 2-3 years.

5. Their cars all immediately sold, always on back order for 6 weeks for every consumer. They just can‚Äôt manufacture them fast enough. Once manufacturing is updated it will double, and they will become profitable. It took Tesla several years to make profit from their vehicles.

6. The government of China has invested over a billion dollars in NIO to ensure they will be around for awhile. It‚Äôs a basically a government backed secure investment.

Ultimately, they really do produce high quality products. It‚Äôs impressive offering different concepts than Tesla‚Äôs market. NIO vehicles have batteries that can easily be swapped in 3 minutes for a full charged fresh battery. Reaching more consumers who don‚Äôt have garages, and live in apartments. 

Here‚Äôs a cool video featuring the NIO on YouTube: https://youtu.be/hTsrDpsYHrw
Trump is associated with less stimulus and stronger dollar. Biden is the opposite.
Explain
F-ck him, p.o.s. get hit by a bus.
TASTY
It looks this way now because they count absentee ballots first (more pro Biden). After that they go through in person votes (more pro Trump)
Cuz I have calls in Quest Diagnostics and Trump hates covid testing.
Rona mishandling, trade war, shitting on trade partners
He got the most votes.

GG Florida. Trump up 100k - Panhandle still to come in

20. Collected 4.08 per on Monday, worth 4.82 per EOD today. Usually play the bull side of things but the premium was too good and it seemed like a sure thing. We‚Äôll see
Does Biden actually feel any kind of affinity towards Scranton? I moved from PA to OH when I was 10 and don‚Äôt consider myself as being from PA

How long does it take to count after polling closes? Are they counting manually

Probably not, but it may be the closest it's been since the 1975 election when it was last blue.

Spreads are the way.
Weird, right?
ngl that would be a cash cow stock
There are really only a few states really in play every 4 years. Those states are traditionally Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, etc. 

Many of the states are solid red or blue.  For instance - you can automatically count the entire West Coast for Biden before a single vote is counted just like you can count parts of the Midwest and South for Trump.
Mcconnell coming back
I tried. It was boring af
Trump won Florida imo he is pulling ahead by 50k
Ohio is the state to watch here

As a Texan... I wouldn't be so sure.  If Biden wins it's going to get fucking crazy here.  Everywhere is going to be getting looted.
It's looking good for Trump in Florida. Almost 90% of the vote is in and typically red counties haven't been counted yet.

Cringe copy paste
I also voted a few times online, just to be sure.
Illinois called for Biden, 0% reporting.

What the fuck?

Id upload the picture but I'm sure others have it.

FL so close is NOT GOOD for MANGO
FL so close holy shit
Excuse my political ignorance, but is FL gone now or Mr. üò¥ü¶ò still has a chance?
Throwback to when people said tesla was too high.
The market definitely has a ü•≠ win priced in.

Tanking hard the more the scales tip.

Come on ü•≠man!
What if you‚Äôre mostly a raging Bull but went temp üåà üêª right at close is a big boy position in VXX calls ?
They can pretty much say there aren't enough votes left for the other to win.
Florida Man slowing down, hard to walk in the swamp.

Time to watch Ohio to see if Trump can catch up with this massive false start.

Cant give a real answer if youre retarded
ü§´ we can‚Äôt jinx this
Assumption from past results. Some states haven‚Äôt voted for another party since the 80‚Äôs
You don't want my advice. But maybe up 21% from today. (7% nasdaq drop)
Long story short, they do lots of polling over time and look at historic vote patterns and are pretty good at guessing that some states are gonna lock for that candidate.  Like Oklahoma... it's going to Trump, it was a lock the second google started reporting it.
Take a shot for every vote that's counted tonight
Stop texting and driving it's fucking selfish and stupid
nio day, nio me my dude
They'll have to talk about... news again... eww
why are futures tanking?
What's the play if there's an upset in the House, and the Dems lose control?
lmao true
Dude i fucking typed my order out and by the time i was done it fucking shot up
Literally only 2 counties have reported. It's SUPER early.
Can i borrow 30k?
Give it a few
No fucking way
VIX futures and UVXY green! Fucking finally!
Yes, some states have such a heavily partisan lean they can safely be called without all the votes in. For example: I can safely call the state of California for Biden, even though no votes have been reported.
This is the way
Texans gonna have lynch mobs looking for Biden signs if it goes blue
Being President would be so surreal
85 - 55 biden right now, says pbs newshour
Fucking texanians betrayed us
This may be a retarded question but does puerto rico get to vote in the election?

I guess that red dildo can be attributed to Florida being too close to call?
You‚Äôre either 10 years old or European goto bed
What downfall? It‚Äôs literally 35 dollars down from 460. It‚Äôs doing great
Here. Only a handful of times did March go +2% to -2%.. direction was usually confirmed by midnight. Tonight is just gonna continue to wipsaw based on news
Definitely interested. Please share.
Whats the highest you'll buy at? Im thinking sub-30 is best case scenario and no brainer. But realistically i think 32 will be the dip.
Awaken almighty VIX. Your time has come
Yes sir!
Texas about to smack these libtards to the curb. FINISH THEM
Bet so I‚Äôll root for ü•≠ tonight.
GREEN OUT (if senate is also red)

Plus/minus 20% is just regular investing this year. Not that crazy. This doesn't belong here.
Its much tighter than everyone thought it would be. Trump is very much alive. Which means there is a greater chance of contested results and delayed stimulus (specially if dems get the house and trump wins)
Better than my nkla puts
just you wait till tomorrow and there is no more artificial Trump prop... gonna be a shit show

Senate seats 7-4 to the dems so far for those watching for stimulus impacts.
Right in Florida for puts I would guess. Which it is right now. May have an Al Gore type recount.
Looking like biden win was priced in, puts if trump pulls ahead
With you brother!
A rollercoaster would be the best way to describe it

What's up with the fucken texans this year?
are we gonna see red or green tomorrow if trump preliminarily wins tonight?
dont get hopes up too high just yet
No clue but I got options expiring on 11/6 at 35C not sure if I want to sell the option or just execute them and buy the shares

Lol futures will be fun to watch tonight
Trump is .02% ahead in FL
Lefties stroking it to TX when basically only Dallas has reported lol
Only 10% counted, this means nothing for now
Wrong
god dammit i should have kept my puts huh
Nasdaq futures holding up way better than the rest. It was just a rotation back into tech all along. Election is just noise.
They did but the market opened up the next day
Have faith. I rebought in at 338p 11/18 today. 
SPY 300-320 hopefully
With the counts this close, mail in counting will give it to Biden in the coming days. So maybe don't act like it was a forgone conclusion.

I‚Äôd say call your mom and put in a good word for me

If Florida barely flips to Biden and becomes crucial you will be fine cause Trump will fight that to the death

I dont understand how people honestly thought Trump was losing FL. He has to win FL to even have a chance, if he loses FL the election is basically over at that point. And FL being this close is not a good sign for Trump either, look at the other states. On another note, watching futures is hilarious right now.
My futures position is bouncing between being up $1000 and being down $300 in a matter of seconds. I've been preparing for this all year and I still wasn't ready.
Crowder!
Wait why did futures crash?
Was going to try buying UVXY at 17.69; now I regret waiting...
No, it's that they don't want the race to be close. Or to not have a clean sweep of blue.

He is wrong.  1 contract represents 100 shares.  You are paying a premium for a reduced price on the stock.  This way it's far cheaper to own 100 shares of stock temporarily, than it usually is to outright purchase 100 shares.
Are you talking about a Wendy‚Äôs union? :)

Markets not happy mango is going to win holy shit üëÄüåàüêª
South we go, on the future charts

This sub is loaded, with pussy farts

They‚Äôll cry when mango, rules the land

They say jerking off, is fucking your hand
There will be an anonymous every where who leaks.
I am drinking mango white claws tonight so it‚Äôs probably not looking good for bidet.
Futures have been banished to the shadow realm
Says he won 68% of the vote... You on crack rocks m'boy?
Talk about a reversal
Markets don‚Äôt like uncertainty, guess bulls forgot last election when the Dow ranked 900 points
Ah. Classic.
Futures dropping off trump winning South Carolina?
Only way you can control the narrative and hope red voters give up at the poll and go home.
futures dont come like this every night...
Trump now leading FL
NC, GA and FL all favoring Trump now per Bloomberg
vix is named volatility index, but really it's a measure of fear. 

in short vix is just a bear indicator.
Once the Republicans get off work it will start to swing red
Dont understand why dems dont think this will happen. Every republican including trump have said this and pelosi wouldn't be able to push back
VIX with the face ripping rally

Trump is up in Florida loool
Florida just flipped
I‚Äôve seen this before. Green in 30 seconds.
Emotional hedge lol
I was wiping my tears from seeing VXX die, but now I'm wiping them with $$$$ from tears of joy.
wow wow wow... dear lord how the fuck did we blow our lead.... fuck sakes
I smell vote fuckery in FL. Watch all the lawyers fly down there tomorrow.
TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP DUMP
Turnout isn't that important this election no ? since so many people voted early/via mail etc..
Lol bulls fucked.
Fuck my ass!!!!

Confused.. what did he do?
Ayy congrats
Thank you
So are we looting tonight or...?

Chloroform to make her pass out and smash till my dick collapse
I'm just looking forward to a Biden win so I can see all the annoying ass die-hard Trumpers have a fit when the country rejects their messiah for his second term.
Hope u guys realize the closer this race is to trump winning the more we will dump. The markets want Biden to win lmao
Tendies disappearing on spy calls
We were up 1% now we'll pump down 1%, and we'll open flat, balance
So trump is slightly winning is the memo im hearing
Im not british, fuck britain. As a spaniard i love America
Or loses. Stimmy still gets passed
[deleted]
Trump gonna win! Futures dropping cause market had priced in Biden win! LOL
It's not really that. It's that it will be close, and he won't concede.
Maga
Drill team six about to fuck some tranny bulls hard, big red dildo tomorrow

This isn't futes final form
Drill team 6 has arrived
What happened in 2000? Do I have to get my Brooks Brothers suit back on and go protest against some Chads?
What does that have to do with anything. Wendy‚Äôs is a franchise and it falls on the cooperation which owns the property to cover the cost. Still just angry single white laborers screaming on the top of their lungs for a man who only takes from them.
"we are projecting Biden is the winner"... with 1% of the vote in. WTF
Nah Trump will pull ahead panhandle votes are coming in
No
Hell I don't know, just wishful thinking I guess!
lol agreed
Hope so
In 2 minutes, another big boy will come to the stage. Are you not entertained?!
üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª
Good
Exactly, thank you! I've been saying this all fucking week, no one wanted to listen. This was going to be contested all along. No way Trump would leave quietly, and no way a blue sweep would be that easy.
Florida about to flip
4.785 vs 4.760, YOU SLOW.

Uhhh, looks like Trump might overtake Biden. Gap keeps shrinking and the swampers haven't reported in yet.
This is like when ppl thought Conor McGregor had a chance against Mayweather, then where surprised when it didn‚Äôt go that way

I still don't understand why people thing COVID is a hoax. They made it entirely political.

That‚Äôs probably a good start
Oh, I'm not saying it's new news.

But I mean, WV was called with 30k votes.

Can't someone do the math and let us know which counties need to vote and who can just stay the fuck home?

3-4% of the vote was needed... So why the fuck do we all vote? It's obvious SO MANY counties have worthless votes.
within .4% brother, holdfast
I did write in my dog's name for president; same amount of mental ram, even though my dog is dead üòÇ
I think it's *extremely* unlikely, but if Trump wins then 2020 will truly be one for the record books.

Famous years in history: 0, 1492, 1776, 2020
CNN and MSNBC only show counties where blue is on top.
Can someone explain why they don't process mail in ballots before election day. Is it because it makes too much sense?
The stock market is definitely not liking it lol
As long as she can sit still and watch Frozen on repeat easy mode.
Imagine thinking higher corporate taxes is bullish for the market

As soon as trump wins he's gonna push stimulus.
im starting to think futures dont like how well mango is doing lol
Think it means they voted 3rd party
Boeing
Holy shit Biden had 15,000 turn out in a heavy democratic part of Georgia that Biden needs to win. Trump might win this if it shows the state of his enthusiasm
they are open, wanna buy amazon right now?

While baptista as retail investors ( the autist) mad crazy plays. Odds are will fail horribly. Small. Not powerful. But when that 619 options doesn't break his own neck and lands the flashy payout amazing
Futures traders getting rich right now.
Where were you when a Florida tie (or close to it) murdered the bull market?
Twitter to gap down tomorrow?
Really nice, stonks bring me money. Im from spain and the uk is honestly shitty, shit weather, shit food and obviously shit stocks. In the future I'll move to America and live the american dream.
I'm showing .4+ for Biden with Trump gaining. Just Google it they've got a tool for election results by district and state
Undertaker gif

Good, I hope all the PJ traders lose their ass‚Äô for that bullshit they pulled last night!
#VIX is green!
Trump winning FL creates uncertainty about overall winner. If Biden wins FL the math for Trump to be reelected is almost impossible
Where you getting your numbers???
Fuck Florida how bout daaat
Don't say you're comfortable holding a stock for 5 years when you literally have a stop loss at 15%. That's fucking retarded.
Mail in ballots in Florida could decide this
also i'm fairly sure bloomberg probably has an API and is just scraping data from either AP or Google, but presenting it with a better UI.
49.5 to 49.5 in Florida
Gonna laugh if they pull a "paper trading contest" and ban every retard in this thread.
Fuck trump and fuck u
Lmao 2,000 votes separating the candidates with almost 10 million votes in.


Florida is straight retarded. And I can say that with confidence because I was born and raised there, and I'm retarded af.
Early take in FL: Biden‚Äôs lead in Dade and other Latino counties are not as big as hoped. Some criticized that Biden didnt do enough to reach out to Miami area Latinos, who are more conservative than Latinos in other parts of the country. Trump also associated Biden with socialism. Latinos in Miami fled from socialist countries like Cuba and hate that
FoxNews: [Link](https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/general-results)

WashingtonPost: [Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) (Homepage)

Biden did awful in Miami, all Latino vote went to Trump and that‚Äôs going to cost him the state
Ya... People who complain markets aren't open... You have futures... If you make this complaint you're a person who doesn't trade and should just stop pretending you follow stocks.
Imagine if ballots were tradable and had options, futures and etfs

FL RED ?
That's because Dems just run up the score in California and New York.  The whole point of the electoral college is to prevent a few large cities from controlling the entire country.
No, it's just that people are seeing this election may be closer than originally thought. And that spells uncertainty = whipsaw futures
Yep. Not sure how that gets changed though I‚Äôm sure dems want to try
season finale of the united states of america is on tonight on FOX
I think the NV news made this dump
All we need are more lockdowns.

This is crazy, less than 50k vote difference between them right now in Florida
#Calculated Risks
i expect mass rioting either way
What's with /u/mmwtgs , is that your burner account? Posted the same shit.

Also your numbers are like 15 minutes behind. It's .6% Biden with 90-99%.
Virginia is called for Biden already by the ap with almost 60% voting for Trump.

Why do we do electoral College?

WV for Trump with 45% trump and 30k reporting.... Like what? If you're in certain counties just tell us our votes don't matter so we don't waste our time.
[deleted]
worst and most likely, it'll be obama v mitch .
nothing gets done
Yeah, fuxk you
Not according to Bloomberg.
How the fuck is this shit always so close? With 4.5M each, there‚Äôs a 5k difference in votes in Florida rn

Probably not, tho I expect small one or two events events from nutjobs. Right has more guns but they're much more docile
go to sleep we probably won't even know in 6-8 hours.
Trumps gonna take Florida
Currently a tie in Florida with only 19% of votes being left.... this is fucking blueballing me

They‚Äôre about to go up 50% if Biden wins. Sell everything before Inauguration Day if that‚Äôs the case
NYT called Florida for Trump
Yeah I watched the great Hack on Netflix and was certain of this outcome when I put the bet on
Weed stocks down with Biden win
Depends on the Senate. Mark Kelly loses in AZ we might go red.
I live here and it would blow your mind how much of the non white vote Trump is getting here... Cubans especially.
If you can call states this early... Our votes don't fucking matter for so many states lol.
[deleted]
voting hopes going well
Damn, I looked away from futs for 5 minutes

Fuck Yes, bring it on
If house and senate split we probably aren't getting stimulus for awhile
Oh...sorry...NOW the British care about our open elections???
Because it‚Äôs almost 8pm
I can almost guarantee either Trump or Biden wins.
Enough will turn - I‚Äôm sure plenty of reds are desperate for a chance to ditch Trump - he‚Äôs a sinking ship whether he‚Äôs re-elected or not.
I got puts on the Don
I'm not sure... Things reverse without warning. But I did sell puts today. I wouldn't mind owning long term
Florida Biden 49.6 to 49.5
Why futures moon
I really hope I bought enough on both sides to come out on top tomorrow
It‚Äôs like if Biden got elected on March 23rd of this year

Do you expect a dip coming up this week? Or should we buy at 35.

Im contemplating on buying ASAP vs waiting a few days and waiting for a dip. But i fear it could rise to 38-40
Nah
The one near me closed for two weeks because of ‚Äúplumbing issues‚Äú   Puts on Dave
Yerp
If this doesn‚Äôt come down to the military blasting Trump out of the White House in January then I want out of this simulation.
seriously wonder if there will be mass rioting if dems win this time
Technical difficulties
Biden leads by 0.1% in FL with 80% counted votes
100%
He takes his time before selecting, evaluating all the choices. Solid DD.
Florida is going to be challenged in the courts 100%
Eh you wait until a few hours then see how crazy futures are swinging.
Historically, the best outcome for markets is republican president with replubilican congress. I dont have a horse in the race, but if you just want markets to go up, republican sweep is the statistically best outcome
The popular vote?  By a 10% margin?  Almost completely.

Hoping it does.
Aren't you in lock down?
Retarded, there's no way he takes a +5% pop vote lead, FFS even Hillary beat his ass.
Even my shitty E*TRADE account has futures.
Cool
Who do I want to win so that we get a fat red day?

My opinion though, is that we‚Äôll get a fat red day if there is no winner announced even by open tomrorow (aka too close to call or no one concedes or generally fuckkery)
georgia close as FUK
LETS GO TRUMP!! KICK SOME ASS!!
What do you think about Americans
My taxes were changed 0% with Trump so I don‚Äôt know what all the hype is about
Don‚Äôt forget the hookers
Yes, this is true. And if you want a cherry on top, is Biden winning, but that it's so close Trump calls fraud and challenges his victory. All hell breaks loose then.
Some constitutional something
This shit is about to end in a tie isn't it.
We will get the final results by Christmas if it closes below 1%
Whoever is playing ES and NQ, I salute your balls of steel.  
  
Not for the faint hearted.
its a big let down that Alex the mother fucking Jones is not on Joe Rogan rn. Spotify really got Rogan by his balls.
You're missing the point. A close FL win for Trump means he probably loses the even tougher states. Trump needs to crush in FL.

Unrelated to election, but got a completely unexpected 8K raise today at 4:45pm and the only thing I could think was ‚Äúthank god my boss didn‚Äôt tell me this an hour ago or I probably would‚Äôve bet it all on this election‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat losses puts/calls!?! Pshhh, my puts/calls printed bigly. It‚Äôs like I didn‚Äôt even bet on the otherside.‚Äù

-Ideally me tomorrow.
can someone tell me how joe biden is winning virginia right now? it says biden has less votes than trump
Fuck Florida

Can the South just secede from the US again, all they do is just freeload off of blue state tax revenue anyway
They‚Äôd need 2/3 of the senate to remove
Sir, this is not Wendy's
Futes don't seem to like it
Florida's gonna to be tighter than someone tipping on the early bird special at Carrows...
If you are holding calls you deserve a medal, honestly. Let's not act like we know what the fuck is gonna happen, but holy shit it's a big dick move to have calls right now.
A contested election..
If Trump had shot out another stimulus check real quick he would have had a much better shot at winning. Neck and neck right now.
Impeachment hearing = Good for üåàüêª

Why Trump is so concerned on processing of  mail-in ballots ? Aren't they valid votes?

If we do get red action, sell your puts and take profit.

Market went red intraday when trump won as the idiots sold, and then went green. 

Samething will happen no matter who wins. 

Haters will sell, then it will turn green as rational people recognize business always prevails.
What makes a professional gambler... you win more than lose?
Futures turning red

I think this is way more likely than some crazy movement personally
Doesn't matter. A narrow win in Florida means Trump will probably lose the midwest battleground. He needed to crush in Florida by 200k, not eek out a 15k win.
It will die, just like my calls
The cities have too much power over everyone's lives as it is. Thank the founders for the electoral system man

If you want that bet id wait until biden loses Florida. Probably get better odds.
Does futures want trump winning Florida or Biden? I‚Äôm confused asf
it's a valid answer for either of them but biden if you must know
Biden
No shit he campaigned as being from Ohio, they jerk off to anyone even remotely from there
Joe leads FL by 150,000 votes, but we have nothing but rural counties left, this will be close.

lmao you're commenting and don't know how things work
Given the current count in FL, I'm calling the whole race for Biden. Trump needed to outperform there to signal momentum in much tougher states.

This could be a bloodbath.

Edit: I did not mean Biden wins FL. I mean Biden wins the white house.

Its tough buddy. I am pretty old now so I have been working and investing the greater part of my adult life.  The best advice I can give is to keep buying broad based indices over time.  Buy more aggressively when the market falls more than 7%.   It is boring as hell but 20 years later you have a good chunk of money.

99% of my investing is boring as hell and has allowed me to get to my goal of retiring at 55.

I've been considering JD as well but I don't know very much about the company and on paper it's not as appealing as BABA. 1/8 the market cap with 6x the P/E ratio which makes me more confident in BABA; especially with Ant Group IPO on the way (but who knows when that'll happen now)

It's kinda nuts that democrats have won the popular vote in 6 out of the last 7 presidential elections. And the one they lost was the second Bush election, which you could argue wouldn't have been possible if Bush didn't win the first time while losing the popular vote, then get re-elected in wartime. 

I'm not necessarily against the electoral college, it's just insane that Republicans have held power for such a large % of time over the past 20 years without ever actually gaining majority support.

keeps going up.. but its still early.  I heard votes in so far are day of voting only so early voting will probably swing it for Biden Biggly
If it hits 23-25 that's a huge win after the run up of late. They have several quarters ahead before the adopters during the last 4-5 months that lead up to this earnings translate to revenue.

Say it with me everyone. ‚ÄúPresident Powell‚Äù. Get used to saying it.
Whipsawing. This was to be expected, they are going to swing a lot on every little voting report. Don't read too much into them right now.
If the election isnt contested bears are fucked
All the little counties that vote trump probably immediately reported 100%. The larger counties that typically vote dem are still voting/tallying
fellow florida man, have faith brother
From VA. The biggest counties in state have not reported. Virginia will be blue, 100%
Not lies

No idea what an IB is...
No it's through CBS coverage. Actually yeah I might try the youtube app instead.

If Trump and all the other reds want to minimize the legal ass fucking a blue gov will give them they‚Äôre gonna keep the economy on track.

I‚Äôm sure they have lobbyists who would be angry if they tanked stuff too - and that lobbyist money is what will help pay their legal fees.

Trump -750 to win Florida on bovada
Not necessarily true anymore because of the shift of other states that are now swing states. But it's still important overall.
I usually just comment bearish sentiments like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget to buy your puts‚Äù so that people on WSB join the bear sentiment and buy puts. We all know the markets do the opposite of what WSB wants. I actually have calls.
Honestly I just want to see the reactions of all of the smug ABC cucks if trump manages to win again lol

Oh man. You‚Äôre a week late.

I'm betting on vol crushing no matter who wins. 

It might spike if Trump says he's contesting the election though.

Feels great.  My calls also feel great.  Perma anything is a fools game
lets be real, as long as the election isnt contested, markets gon be green tomorrow

thats the wild card right now, if biden wins and its close then we have a problem
If Trump were to have a surprise night like 2016, he'd already be up in Florida. It was one of his better "toss-up" states this year. Biden's lead is solid.
I hope they have those flute guys at the front with the drummers. That‚Äôs be dope

I came to the comments hoping to see someone's reaction to it, so I can know what it said
I hate when they repeat ‚Äútoo early to call‚Äù.  Like no shit asshole, the polls just closed
Amen

Yes that's probably true. But it looks like it's heading that way.

So if markets are adjusting for a biden win, then that means everything should moon if trump wins right?
[deleted]
Lol next polls close in 1 min, STILL TO EARLY TO CALL
VIX is the projected future 30 day volatility, not the current realized volatility. VIX dropping means the market thinks there will be a clear winner.

We don't even wait for the real numbers, we look at midnight futures and go OMFG RED even though it goes green the next day.

Are you me?
Trump is leading Florida by 1% so bears are celebrating
May whomever win be 100% focused on creating new ATHs in the stock market weekly. Amen.
Even if futures go up more, or come back down in the next hour, realistically the movement isn't going to matter at all until at least 10pm-1am. That's when you'll have a much clearer picture of how this is going to play out. Until then, your stupid SPY mOoNiNG comments are pointless.

Yeah but I think it's theoretically possible to win with only like 30% of the vote or something stupid
I dunno man, Trump killing it in miami.

Impressive. Mine was -94.
Bidens always been ahead
The fact trump has majority of the middle/southern counties in Florida with 0 northern countries counted makes me confident he will win Florida.
AMC 18 JUN 21 $7
Source?
I mean, we'll just have to agree to disagree, but we finally get a black president and Trump goes on a fucking campaign to try to prove he isn't American even though there wasn't evidence to back it up.
I‚Äôm up 5% today soooooo
> Dade county is 54% for Biden

CLinton got over %60 last time
Be like us brazillians... a shitton of parties that stand for nothing in specific other than corruption.
Kinda stupid that that Kentucky gets so much power over the U.S. when all they're known for is chicken and jelly.
BIDEN WINS BEIJING
The mass exit from VXX tomorrow will be incredible
Us election seems super complex when I read your comment.
Especially on swordfish.
OLED or nothing for me.  I‚Äôll go store to store if need be.
NBC
I‚Äôm looking at google live and it‚Äôs saying Biden has a 3% lead
He and his followers will shout 'silent majority' for another 4 years. Not knowing what majority means.

Jesus christ Trump is killing it in Miami compared to last time
Back in August I sold some November 20 iron condors and they lost zero value since then because VIX decided to jump to fucking 40. Tomorrow I'll finally start profiting from those iron condors after sitting on them for 2 months.

Never selling anything longer than 28 days again.
as Biden‚Äôs odds increase market gets more red, you see the pattern here ?
Wow can this election make or break murica?
What are the plays here? Been out of the MJ stocks for awhile now after getting burned there...
Fuuuck those are bad numbers for Biden
Where are you seeing that?
spy 341 at open 347 at close
And proud to be one I'm  sure. You think Americans watch anything about your prime Minister. You're literally irrelevant to us. 

Every important country has its struggles. I've only ever seen Canada struggle on south park. So sit back with your ketchup popcorn or whatever the hell it's you eat at the movies, watch the show, and ü§´ü§´ü§´.
I think the presidential election is decided
so does it seem like futes aren't rooting for big T?
I still got time on these VXX calls. But I‚Äôm getting big scared rn
Same for GA. If GA goes blue, Trump is fucked.
Everytime orange takes the lead in Florida, futures start to fade. ü§îü§îü§î
Salamander milk is worth it's weight in gold.
Cool. Thanks brother. Just looking for most down the middle coverage if I can. Don‚Äôt care about all the bs

its too early to tell anything lol
3% of votes counted in Georgia and Biden is winning by 10%
Florida gonna be close
Trump is only down by 9% in Miami with 84% of the vote in....Hiliary won Miami by over 30% lmaooo

The only thing that ViX loves is trumps Twitter
I agree with buying this dip, especially since it would be an irrational sell off. I‚Äôm just saying that libertarians would argue the ‚Äúdems make stonks go up‚Äù data might be misleading.

If stocks are forward looking, if rich people believe dems will hurt stocks they can go down in anticipation of the coming tax regime which is being measured as stocks going down during a republican. Then anticipation of the political pendulum swinging toward a lower tax regime might make forward looking stocks go up at the end of democrat presidencies in anticipation.
Bet on red if Biden wins. Garanteed tendies
Goodbye IVANKA I‚Äôve always loved you

I really like this thread so am coming back to write something I saw here. 

There is a retired surgeon member who realized at least 1M or so last year trading AMD. Based on posts I remember, I am fairly certain he paid or partially paid the student loans of a pre-med student member here who was down on his luck. That was a real wsb feel-good moment.
Fuck, markets would be up 25%+.
Personally I think anyone is better than Mango Smallhands, but the market gives zero fucks as long as there is certainty. There will be stimulus and Fed printing either way.
Can‚Äôt. Polls are closed.

Too soon to tell. Dems voted heavy early and Republicans turned out heavily today. If the results are close the panhandle could turn it red. If polls were even remotely accurate, Biden easily

Florida is a swing state. This means that they choose to have an open relationship. Sometimes, they go for the republicans and sometimes they go with the democrats. In the swinging world, Floridians make their own rules around what they need within political affiliations and vow to abide by the boundaries set forth.

2016 mango won Florida by like 117k votes

this is gonna be intense as fuck
At this price I am playing to get both. I haven't bought TLT in many years and it isn't normally even on my radar but I like some cash safe here with a solid month or two return thinking the broader market will be lower in a month or two when I'll cycle back. I know most are bulls here but I expect a selloff end of year due to a Biden win and Covid round 2 being bigger than what people seem to realize (seems a bit crazy to me!). Market doesn't reflect the real economy though, so I may be wrong.
Trump duh.
ayeeeeeeeee will be drunk fast as shit man hahaha
Polls weren't fucking wrong in 2016. The national vote was correct. Hillary got more votes and that's what idiots quoted, national numbers.

The state polls were right or within margin of error. 

People literally just ignored ANY result that favored trump because "hmm.. That seems crazy".

It is amazing to me to see the number of people who see something on social media and/or tv and immediately forward it on if they agree, or ignore if there is an opposing viewpoint.

Bruh not autist if you‚Äôre leaving 17k liquid, ur just smart
Biden‚Äôs plan for the savers credit is for a tax credit paid to you for 26% of your contribution to a pre-tax 401k. If you make $80,000 per year and contribute 10% to your pretax 401k, that works out to a tax credit of $2080. Under the current plan, all other things being equal, you would see a tax savings of $1760. Where are you getting your info?
CNN is so entertaining to watch atm. They sound like us when analyzing every possible Biden win.
Didn‚Äôt know Briggs and Stratton was bankrupt
6 month long con. I regretted not getting any action in 2016 and decided to leverage a string-bet. Strategy:

1. Straight up bets on trump win on bookies. They give a 3:1 for your money and that seems like the best bet. Ive put $ 12 000 and im just waiting to cash in.
2. Do clever research and realize s&p500 goes higher the first five days after the reelection of all last presidents last 20 years. S&p took a 15% dump after Obama on election, then just 5% down days after reelection. Trump had a solig 3% s&p gain after 2016 win, so im pretty confident we will see a 5-6% gain first-two days after results are in. This is the only weak point in my strategy, because WHEN is key here. This will also act as a catalyst the longer no clear winner is determined because the market will stagnate or fall. Then, when he is decleared winner, go ALL INN 38k USD on a 32x geared long derivate of the s&p for a day maybe two.
3. Cash in a small portion to cover christmas expences now that I have a 1 year old child, and re-invest the rest. Any tips on strategy afterwards?
Because I bought puts.

Well certainly -- they tightened monetary policy -- and that was a result of Hoover, as I recall. But to blame them is stupid. And it's especially stupid coming from people who advocate for the gold standard, which caused the constricted  monetary policy in the first place.

And it's triply stupid to assume that the Fed hasn't changed since then in both power and policy, and also gained knowledge.
it absolutely works both ways. both sides shut the other out. there is no dialogue. and i put a lot of blame on our media. fox, cnn, msnbc pump their bias to the partisans.

Sir, this is a WSB.

pricy and rare tonight
Who is ¬£ ?
Honestly, I would be surprised if it was a landslide. I think it will be close and close enough for Trump to contest it and drag it out
This is like when The undertaker and Batista would fight. Shit can‚Äôt be predicted.

Fellow autists who fuck with volatility, know what you're in before losing your asses! Understand the differences among VIX, VXX, VXZ, /VX, UVXY, etc.

Check the futures curve and the VIX option chain to see what is priced in, and have a look and at the composition of swap and futures-based products like UVXY.

Yeah. I sold a 116 weekly this time around because I‚Äôm a scared pussy and would be fine with making some money and dipping out after the election if it were to be called away.

Long term I plan on selling further OTM, especially once I make my money back. I‚Äôm planning on this to be a long term play so the covered calls are basically a bit of added cash. But ya know...if they get exercised then at least I made some dough.

Ya I voted Obama. Didn't vote when it was Hillary Trump.  Then switched to Trump this one because I'm sick of the cancel idiots like r/politics.  Even if they double down and make everyone's life worst. At least I can feel i stood up for freedom of speech.  People have died for it. I just have to deal with more social media bots and morons.

You do you homie, just uh don't be some weirdo simp that pretends that person is your real girlfriend
If you think Trump is a good President because he had a good economy then you must think Hitler was the best leader of all time. That man had a thriving economy with 0% unemployment.

It's a pendulous progression.
Biden‚Äôs plan only allows a personal deduction of 27% of what you could possibly put into the 401k. The current tax deduction allows your entire 401k contribution and an additional 12k.
I guess we'll find out shortly.

I'm at $1.2M and only try to average 25% annual. Lower risk is what I want.
Calls on ladyboys
You are conflating two different things. The standard deduction and 401k credits are separate. If you compare Biden‚Äôs proposal to the current one, no matter how you calculate it you get more money back as a credit under Biden‚Äôs plan if you make less than 163,300. How smooth is your brain?
Their puts will be printing if we got a communist elected

Each state has a certain number of electoral college votes depending on the population size of that state. Depending on which candidate wins in a state that candidate gets ALL the votes of that state. So it Biden wins by 1% in Texas all of Texas‚Äô votes go to Biden.

People have been able to vote by mail or vote in person. It takes time for votes to be counted (especially mail in votes). We can expect results for early mail in votes and in person votes sometime in the next few hours but many of the mail in ballots won‚Äôt be counted for 2-3 weeks üòÆ

Many states are pretty solidly republican or democrat. So really the election mostly lies in the hands of a few states which are hard to tell who they will vote for. This year keep your eyes peeled for Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.

There's always uncertainty, its a market. There are other factors at play besides the election. We're up 100 points now on the S&P BEFORE polls close. It has already exceeded my expectation on the trade - as far as I'm concerned the market is absolutely expecting a Biden win. Trump lost the minute he announced he got COVID - the market turned hard that night into a Joe Biden victory. The isolation of posters here however are in a group think bubble that's about to pop. Days later everyone will talk about how obvious it was - except clearly it was not.

I really am not sure what you mean by not tracking accordingly. 

Nothing is certain though, I'm just early, and it pays to be early (if correct) I would be very very surprised if I'm wrong, but I've put myself out there, we'll see how things turn out shortly.
Lmao this should be the only trend
Oh yeah, prop 21 in CA, right?  Uber will just pull out of CA

We went from testing 323 to now breaking 339 within 2 trading sessions.  
  
A 5% rise. Insane.
That's fair.
ah
Futes not eveb budging.....damn....
Correct - but the Tesla is about 400k+ cheaper than a high end lambo, and if you're talking 'track racing laps etc" you can buy a legit Formula 2 race car (as well) for c.200k that will  smash any lambo on any race track....and still have $200k left over!

Trying to figure out which stocks are taking these election gains. So far I see FSLY with the biggest stiffie

Yeah get ready for ban or losing your dick
Puts on trump
Well there are two main political parties, so it stands to reason that there will supporters of both, right
Looks just like SPY
Right there with you
Just like we're doing now. Look how much left vs right propaganda there is and how many people are disregarding each other because one is a conservative and one is a liberal. Politicians are getting away with greed, corruption and incompetence while we debate over trivial shit like who's more brainwashed than the other

BREAKING: In response to looting concerns, the Federal Government has allocated billions of FEMA funds for GameStop Corp. (GME) to ensure it has the necessary funds to survive a social uprising.

Concerns that younger looters may want revenge on GameStop for ripping them off over a decade ago with unfair trade-ins led to the decision.


One analyst believes GameStop's market cap will be worth $10 Billion after tomorrow's open.

As I sit here, and drink myself to death
I think the most straightforward answer is that I think we should have a good president. I'm not a fan of the nihilism argument that "it doesn't really matter so why do you care?" Surely we've got higher standards than that. 

The practical answer is I have insurance through the ACA. He's actively trying to remove it without a replacement. I was actually hopeful that an outsider like him could tear through industry and bureaucracy and set up a new system where health insurance was affordable like he said he would do. But I can see now that it was all just hot air. There's no plan, there's no outline, after 4 years of saying "next month".
Bought a spy put to hedge. What a waste of money. Fuck you bears

I don't know how travelled you are, but America is one of the least racist places in the world, definitely the least racist place I have been to. I don't believe the systematic racist narrative one bit, but I know we will never agree there.

I do think your insane for not blaming someone who destroys your things because they are emotional at someone else, fuck that I worked hard to get where I am and if someone wanted to destroy my property I would kill to defend it

SPY 270
Dude the delegates aka electors can't vote for whoever they want. Their delegates are assigned to the majority winner of the state. The states are almost all winner take all. If the results are in dispute it goes to the House and Senate no matter what. The house doesn't select the president on simple majority either, it's based on who holds the majority of seats in each state and each state then has a vote or each state delegation has a vote. Currently the Republicans have a majority in 25 states and the Democrats in 24.
I wanted to watch the election but I started too early and I‚Äôm kinda fucked up. How do I gamble on this
Unlike some communists in this country, I Just voted for mango man.

I was thinking too smol brain and thought we might crash. Miscalculated. Bears are fuk.

Yes but that doesn‚Äôt translate to stock prices as news moves stock prices more than sales do. Plus who gets the benefit, do I think the manufacturing company is the one who will reap the benefit of the increase volume, or is the physical/online retailer the one who is most likely to see an increase in value as a result? Is it both? And it very easily can be offset by any negative news whether true or false that comes out about that company. 

The stock market doesn‚Äôt move the way it should because it‚Äôs not an indicator of present value alone, but also all future predicted profit and value. And as such like I said news and feelings of consumers matter just as much and usually more than current or even past sales trends.

Where‚Äôs that?
I thought this was good! I agree that the market will respond favorably to a Dem sweep.  I do have a question -- Is the market more skeptical of a Biden win than the polls?  If the election news is so good for Biden, why hasn't the market tracked accordingly? You paint a portrait of certainty, but the market seems to disagree.

12 More Years
The presidential system in the US is odd. 

Each state has a number of Electors based on the population. The candidate who wins the popular vote of a state receives the votes of all of that state‚Äôs Electors. 

So the election results come in as each state reports who won the state and the Electors are assigned to one candidate or another. 

When one candidate hits 270 Electoral votes the election is called or determined. 

This is the default scenario with no recounts or ‚Äúfraud‚Äù accusations or whatever else may happen. 

I can go into more detail if you‚Äôd like!

So staying cash gang until around 2069??
I just fired my financial advisor at Morgan Stanley - told him I have a new advisor
i vote for third party nearly every election because both, dem and rep parties are corrupt bastards. i have to say, biden winning scares me. i don't think he can make it a full 4 years. he's clearly in mental decline. means, kamala is on deck and she really scares me cuz she's very much a lefty (biden being left of center) and could push policies that tank this economy.
KT?
SPY is mooning after hours due to these early results
Pennsylvania won‚Äôt be done tonight and it‚Äôs the most likely tipping point state, no way we get accurate results tonight.

Those are rookie numbers.

Damn really? Where did you get that info?

Not the most important thing. It‚Äôs equally important. A president is spokesman and emissary for the 300 million residents of the country. 

trump is a petty, small man. He‚Äôs an embarrassment to our nation and has left us as divided as we‚Äôve ever been since slavery was a thing. Look at the boarded up businesses across the nation now if you don‚Äôt believe me. 

The trump presidency will go down as one of the darkest moments in American history and rightfully so. We need to correct the mistake tonight
BYEDON 2020!!
Why would someone competent aspire to become president?
Does anyone else feel like between Executive, Judicial, and Legislative that the president has the LEAST significant impact on our day-to-day lives? Far less than legislative at least, IMO. Yet we all get so worked up over who the president is the most and sling the most shit over that than anything else?

Lol no, the electoral college isn‚Äôt tied to any laws requiring them to vote based on the outcome of anything else. Even so, they just would abstain. The election continues. If one of the candidates gets 270 electoral votes they win. 

If they don‚Äôt it falls to congress then and there to vote for it. Regardless the show rolls on. House and senate will vote for president and Vice President.

Just go read the Wikipedia lol. There‚Äôs **policies and procedures** for it. That‚Äôs government for you!

How do you know he's the lesser evil when nobody knows anything about him yet? Did you know what trump was gonna be before he got into office?
Democrats are dangerous because they play with people's emotions and they try to influence indirectly. Trump is being a retard sometimes but at least he doesn't hide his opinions and him being direct (too much at times) should actually be comforting you

Here's the thing, your reasoning behind the market rally means jackshit. I'm also in calls but for completely different reasons:

1. Technical reversal pattern with 90% success rate.
2. Exact same pattern played out in 2016. VIX topped and DJI bottomed on the last Fri before the elections.
3. There's absolutely zero outcome where market tanks because all outcomes are risk positive.
4. I think Trump wins and market spikes another 5%.

Market does what market wants and don't let a lucky roulette round get to your head. If market doesn't agree with my direction I'll be the first one out the door.

Futures pricing in a rally tomorrow hence the rally in futures
The pattern over the past few months has been huge run up then consolidation followed by another run up. 

But more recently that consolidation period isn't really happening....jumped from 23 to 28 then 28 to 32 and now 32 to 35 super quickly. So you could bet on a consolidation period but there might not actually one at all.

Nope, sorry I'm not the fantasy "liberal" person that lives in your head. Also FWIW I consider myself fairly left, to the point that I'd use the word "liberal" to refer to both Democrats and Republicans in the US.

Market was down about 55% when they took office, now it‚Äôs up 50%. Interesting change of pace for him if he wins.
Oh S H I T KY jelly wtf is that about?

Did people actually move when trump won last time?
I don‚Äôt care who wins - I will still be here for you all
I agree. Short term I am extremely bullish if we get democratic sweep and big stimulus. Long term, I am extremely bearish on the USD. Not sure about equities because government might have to enact UBI. A lot of jobs won‚Äôt be coming back.

I think we are disagreeing on the short term. But also keep in mind there‚Äôs some money still for use from CARES and also it‚Äôs only 2 months until a new stimulus (not that long). And there‚Äôs also eviction ban.
Poll going strong. 336 votes polled.

My bad I meant to comment on post below this one
Anyone notice QQQ has been the weakest and IWM has been stronger? That‚Äôs market pricing in Biden win.
He brings together rich people, rednecks, racists AND Christians which is a pretty fucking huge support group.
Cheers back at ya!

I believe it will go to Biden based on the democratic energy being at an all-time high in the state & all fresh 18-year olds are being encouraged to vote for Biden

See that's the main problem. People hate trump so they just vote for someone who's not him. I am betting you that 90% of these new young voters have no idea what Biden is all about but they get a vote in cause everyone tells them its the right thing to do
[deleted]
And the texts and calls
I tried to sell my NIO calls at 3:59 and missed cause I was on a work call. I think that was the universe saying ‚ÄúNah dude, hold those another day, bigly pump tomorrow.‚Äù

Wait till we take out the highs maybe?
Up 10%
Anyone know what time Florida will report? I‚Äôm convinced whoever wins that state wins the election

Today was weird but I bought at market open due to a feeling, and made a killing. Fucking NIO was on an Elon rocket blasting off to the moon. I even made money on fucking Del Taco yo.

Vote counting won't technically be done for weeks, and the electoral college results aren't final until December.

But depending on how everything goes, an accurate projection can be made, sometimes in the early morning on Nov 4. If it's close, it could take days, or weeks, to count the absentee ballots and make an accurate projection.

Really depends if it's a landslide or not.
We should know by tn, and don't trust polls. Clinton was leading them all campaign and Trump still won.
China won't let that happen
I don‚Äôt understand why Disneyland is closed in California, if people want to go, let them go man, it‚Äôs their choice. If you‚Äôre so afraid of this damn virus stay inside fucking Christ there I said it.

You guys are pretty cool so I ask, as a non American, how does this elections work? 

Main questions: when do we know who won? Where can I see some sort of pre-counting or official polls?
everyone sayin bears r fuked makes me think tomorrow will be the darkest red we've seen since March.
BREAKING: In response to looting concerns, the Federal Government has allocated billions of FEMA funds for GameStop Corp. (GME) to ensure it has the necessary funds to survive a social uprising. 

Concerns that younger looters may want revenge on GameStop for ripping them off over a decade ago with unfair trade-ins led to the decision. 

One analyst believes GameStop's market cap will be worth $10 Billion after tomorrow's open.
Mods thank you for not being gey and giving us this for once.

No, it never is. Tomorrow should be tendies for all
Yeah there are A lot of pro lifers but I think most vote on economic issues depending on where there from. I'm from Fl here most are republicans since so many cubanos. Used to live in Ca there most are democrats and Mexicans. Think Texan Hispanics  are the latter.
Don't forget the butt-fuck portion of NH - someone from NH
Yeah go all in
Not really, I have looked into both tax plans pretty deeply.

Bro I look at the facts not the media. The facts are that Biden wants to dip his nose in my pocket, prefers that welfare leeches get more money from me because they do not believe in working hard.
Socialism helps those who need a system to rely on, not independent people who take responsibility for their lives. And that's a fact

Yea it‚Äôs just like not voting. But Ross Perot got 19% of the vote back in 1992, so its possible if we ever had a candidate like him who also appealed to young people + minorities (to get that to 40%+), it could make a difference.
If you think it will only apply to 400k+ then you're in for a surprise.

What happened to everyone's balls in this sub.
Sauce? All I saw was Dicksville Notch
Posted this last night

Biden's national poll numbers are fantastic, the margin required of error is just too unlikely for trump to win the electoral college. State level polling is also quite excellent. Early voting is up 100% from 2016, 97 million ballots already counted. Turnout will be record numbers. High turnout is crucial for democratic victories. Democratic voters are highly energized and singularly unified - no matter what astroturfing happens online here and elsewhere.

Senate projections look extremely strong for democrats. 2018 midterm elections were a huge democratic sweep, they outperformed significantly. Why? The entire issue was trump on the ballot. The 2018 House change was the largest change of seats in decades - it was a complete destruction of republicans. In the 2 years since then had trump made ANY inroads with voters? Absolutely not, they hate him even more than they did then. The evidence leads to more likelihood of a blue sweep. Plain and simple - the EVIDENCE - not feelings - points to a massive democratic victory tomorrow. A massive victory completely destroys any chance for trump with legal shenanigans, further, we understand the results likely tonight. It becomes apparent to all and his twitter becomes impotent to anyone that matters. All focus moves to the new Biden administration.

Now that the election has been understood there are the markets...

The market has been negative almost every single day for 2 weeks with worry and uncertainty. Not entirely electoral but nonetheless - there is an enormous amount of hot money waiting to get back in.

If there is a blue sweep in the election, the market is looking for a $2.2T stimulus at minimum - and the expectation is even up to $3-4T. Do you recall what happened last time we spent $3T dollars in printed funds? Stimmy checks flow to people, schools get billions of dollars, kids get a plan to go back to school, free vaccines, states get billions in funds for budgets, confidence will moon. The dollar will tank, and gold will be good - but stocks will finally get a lot of pent up fear crushed. Volatility will get destroyed - RIP all those UVXY and puts posts i see.

Long 5 /ES contracts aka $825k of SPY from yesterday's close. https://i.imgur.com/IjSZYef.png

This is my analysis, and it can be wrong in a few places but still leave me with a profitable trade. Worst case would be a trump victory, though highly unlikely - if that looks like that might happen, markets will implode - it may be short term, highly uncertain, but I think clearly negative - and I hope I can exit the position fast enough.

All day long I saw people wondering why's the market up so much today?? Well, now you know - the best tasting tendies for me yet - and still more to go.
Just voted in the WPG election. Might vote in this one too

The initial margin require though is still damn high which I think is not set by the brokers. I use to trade like 5 ES at a time, but now need bigly money to do it.
I know lots of suburban women voting for Trump. We have no idea who will win.
CNN, FOX, and MSNBC are trash.


But I gotta be honest, I legitimately live for John King and his touch wall, zooming in and out of counties and shit.

I can't get enough of it. Gonna watch this shit all night then go back to never watching CNN for 4 years
My calls do depend on it
What do you have?
I can't deduct any donations. Welcome to Europe.

To be fair, haven't seen any big wins yet either.

You guys are brutal, I just wanted to have a laugh
what changed for you?
is futures moving on Trump winning Indiana, but that's expected?
someone link me the election live feed
Like 50k votes lmao

Trump probably wins it but still too early
Definitely  did not say monthly honey. You dreaming. Only director level, fellows, C level employees make that monthly.
BUSH DID 9/11
fuck that red candle. it's gonna be a long night of staring at futures with puckered cheeks
I have calls, but I‚Äôd like to remind everyone that futures went up in a similar fashion on the night after the first debate and proceeded to tank to deep red shortly after. So don‚Äôt dance yet.

Not really rallying for nothing. There was hesitation that there wouldn't be a clear leader. Now it seems like Biden will most likely win. Which means a huge stim package. Aka bullish. This game is literally too easy.

Go ahead and aspire to be successful and rich while getting financially wiped out by a health issue under current system that ties health care to your job. What about wanting a better system for health care implies a desire to not be successful and rich?

Nice fishing trip, troll.
Depending on the results, I can see SPY futures at 3600+
Heads up guys.

There‚Äôs not going to be a contested election. There‚Äôs definitely not going to be a civil war. 

[Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/11/922827554/gen-mark-milley-says-the-military-plays-no-role-in-elections) already said *publicly* months ago that they don‚Äôt work for Trump and won‚Äôt support any election bullshit.


If there‚Äôs a big blue or red landslide then there‚Äôs no contest or issues. 


If it‚Äôs a close race, [contested elections need to be recounted and declared 6 days before](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641) December 14th, because that is when the electoral college votes. And once they vote; it‚Äôs over. Their say is the final say either way. There doesn‚Äôt need to be an inauguration. No ceremony. Nothing. Who they decide WILL be president. 

People know this. This isn‚Äôt a secret. Do you think smart money is out there loaded with VIX calls? No. Because they know regardless of how we poors vote, they know it doesn‚Äôt matter until December 14th. And when it‚Äôs over it‚Äôs over.

Futures manipulation is so strong tonight
Feels good to be a reserve currency
The way I see it is that mango hasn't really responded to any of those issues. 

He talks shit about the (legitimate) peaceful protesters, riles up his supporters, and doesn't take responsibility for making half of the country believe that covid is a political thing.

He could have sat back and coasted to re-election if he didn't try to make everything about himself. Narcissistic retard.
Well I got one today expiring the 20th and it‚Äôs a $116 call. Hopefully it goes up tomorrow so we can sell

What you think schools teach: "ok kids, now we'll cover principles of personal finance so you can save your money and not get ripped off. Then, we'll explain exactly what you should say and do if stopped by the police, so you don't get in trouble."

What schools actually teach: "Oppression and exploitation is what America is and always has been all about! The only thing you can do is overthrow the system!"

What‚Äôs next
this is the way.
whats the best place to watch election
Liberals are what's wrong with today's society. Sad people who can't think for themselves and need to depend on a bigger daddy to help them cope with life.
I miss the days where individualism was regarded as strong and people aspired to be successful and rich . Now everyone's jealous, crying and doing tiktoks while wondering why their life is shit but instead of blaming themselves they blame trump.

Sadly these same people have been led to believe they're the smarter ones by the media and all other sad creatures like them. Open your eyes, it's not good to be part of a desperate herd. Think for yourself, don't be influenced. Smh
Trump plays a huge role in the market. Especially if he‚Äôs elected. My YOLO spy calls depend on it. üò§ I‚Äôm buying a fuckin lambo this weekend.
I thought something was A-mish
Just buy calls duh
I mean, he put quite a lot of thought into it all the way until the very end so I'd say he's trustworthy.
Me thinks the market was pricing in a trump loss not a biden win
But muh stonks have never been better!
Oh god I‚Äôm getting jplowed rn
There arent 540 missing kids. They are unable to find the *parents* of the kids. Biden replied to someone from the crowd who mentioned it and said "we are going to find those kids"

And make sure their parents are together?? Uh what?
waittttt, this is so sad being a robinhood trader, i cant buy stonk rn...Id buy the hell outta some stonk rn :(
They used it for blackmail for years then decided dumping it was with more to try to influence the election.

FUTURES ALGOS SET TO \*\*MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE\*\* TONIGHT

I wonder how many people are gonna turn to Biden fans when he wins and markets boom for months
How are my EOD puts I bought doing boys? üòé
Elections are run by the states. More specifically, the states‚Äô Secretaries of State. Some states have said all ballots must be received by tonight. Some have said 3 days. Some have said 2 weeks. It all just depends. 

Re: lawsuits. Federal courts have done well to stay out of electoral issues, for the most part. See some Texas GOP loons that tried to get 120,000 votes in Harris county thrown out. They went to federal court and were denied a hearing.

What happened to SPY after hours??
This. People bitching about the mail - Oregon has been mail-in my whole voting life, you can't mail it in time then drop it off at a county drop box, not that hard.
The majority hates him
Shit's planned, anything to show how "good" the economy is. Imagine a pissed Donnie going  HAM on twitter because it's over.
Vix dying
Most likely yes, market prices in things much less likely than a Biden win

Trump can still win, but it's the least likely outcome by far
So a jebaited pump by initially going for green then a market crash if i understood this dd. Solid work.
Yep. Buttgieg VP 2024 LMAO. I love it

Only 1% Iof votes reported and the market is mooning. This is gonna crash hard with reality
Trump leading the early vote count in 3 states already

I actually do agree he somewhat sold out by backing Biden. Maybe he thinks getting a place, along with yang and AOC is worth it. Socialized medicine and education doesn‚Äôt make him a socialist. By that term any sort of bailout is ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù. Bailing out banks, automobile companies, even a stimulus check is ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù.
Holy shit why is futures literally mooning so early
I can‚Äôt wait to call my Republican dad when Biden is declared president elect. Going to hear a lot of racism.

So reversing the expected outcome would reverse the MM sourced reversal? Does it work that way or would the effects be additive?

I need Trump to lose with as little grace as possibly for my $7 F Puts to print.

No I don't member that since markets close hours before polls do.  Give me your drugs.
These are contentious times, people feel angry and alienated. But let's just keep everyone from expressing the full spectrum of emotions because we need to keep things neat and in a bubble.
Politicians say shit all the time.

Like how Trump totally was gonna have a totally great health plan in a week! 2 years ago
Watch. We are going to kiss, peck, just slightly tease 3400 and then drill into the core of the black hole at the center of our universe.

I never cared for money, only as a means of freedom. It doesn't bring me joy so I'll happily pay more taxes so long as it goes where it is needed and so long that it is reasonable. Being pre-occupied with such trivial things like that instead of focusing on life is very lame to me.
what the fuck is this pump from no where
abolish people
China wants in on IPO, guarantee Baba will moon. Today was a set back for them to buy while it was short squeezed.
Biden would still have their electoral votes.

If Biden wins any one of those it's like 99%. He can lose PA then and just needs to hold WI/MI, which would be the greatest state polling errors in recent history.
Haha yea.. the prices are right! I‚Äôll be holding for awhile
I actually have futures trading enabled. But I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll trade since I probably will get smoked.
No because it‚Äôs gunna get IV crushed

You can find them on 4chan. there is a video of Natalie giving him a footjob, i've seen it. There are also texts etc. that put them together and are very incriminating
Lmao futes mooning and it‚Äôs funny because I know everyone is in SPY puts and VXX calls. Logically so.
Call be right.

Oh word! Then... you are a genius!
Biden = electricity, weed; Trump = inflating the bubble even more until it eventually pops sometime next year

Holy fuck SPY on a tear lmao
Facts, both parties took a second to stop bickering to make sure the Bernie train didn‚Äôt leave the station. Twice.
538 gives Trump a 10% chance of winning. It‚Äôs more likely that the polls overestimated Trump supporters than underestimated them this time too.

Joe Biden is an f word that we have recently not been able to say.
ruh oh americans about to do something stupid
If you have to ask, you shouldn‚Äôt be playing this game
Given how much I've heard about people loving to see liberal tears, making liberals cry, etc... I better not hear ANY COMPLAINING when Biden wins.
More bankruptcies means a lot more layoffs means a lot less people buying shit (no matter where).
Bernie genuinely cares about people, which is why he wasn‚Äôt elected.
Where are these vids? Lost in the mail like Tuckers docs?

I don‚Äôt think the market cares about Main Street. More bankruptcies mean more market share for the larger corps, unfortunately, eventually wall streets pockets will be lined and the wealth gap continues its steep stratification.
Doesn't mean he won't make his own tax cuts.

Y‚Äôall remember 2016, it was obvious before markets closed she wasn‚Äôt going to win
I dunno man. The left fucked up hard last time, they seem like they just doubled down on their stupid shit by picking Biden
Exp?
One of you fucking drool monkeys link me to the exit poll I can‚Äôt find it
I think stimulus might happen in this circumstance because dems just wanted to not get it in before election. If they lose it wont matter.
States to watch tonight:

FL, GA, NC (should have a good idea), AZ, NE2nd.

If Biden wins just two of those, game over for Trump. If Biden wins even just FL out of all those 85% chance Trump has lost.

Something I like about Elon Musk is that he responds with answers to shit people ask on twitter. ‚ÄúIs starlink coming to X?‚Äù Musk - ‚Äúyeah xyz reasons, but we‚Äôll get there.‚Äù ‚Äú Is the cybertruck gonna do this?‚Äù Musk - ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be available until at least 2022.‚Äù Or some feedback will be given and Musk will be like ‚ÄúOh shit, yeah we‚Äôll fix that.‚Äù

I think the worst outcome for our stocks and the market is Trump keeps the White House and Dems take control of House AND Senate.  Then NOTHING is getting done.  It will be gridlock.  No stimmy - no nothing.

Not a political statement about whether the candidates are good or bad- just a statement about the outcome.
The betting market is much better imho.

Can you explain why Trump is a worse candidate than Biden at this point? 

People act like they are polar opposites and that Trump is the worst thing ever when in reality they are both centrists. People just hate Trump personally and get caught up over these inconsequential social issues while missing out on the things that matter. 

For example the race issue is more of a wealth inequality issue; it just happens that most inherited wealth goes to whites because of the way things were in the past. Poor whites (the majority) are as bad off as anyone else.

You have the right to vote and the right for that vote to be meaningless no matter how much you downvote on r/politics
you mean his strategy of "fuck you, old people. die poor" didn't resonate strongly with them?
Biden is going to win but the story will be told as Trump being the real hero. He thought he was tearing up the democratic party, when in reality he was only making them realize how important every vote was. They went on to take control of the house, senate, and white house that very next election, fucking the republican party even harder than they could've imagined, distancing themselves from their core voting demographic and replacing it with college frat boys nationwide.

But wouldn't happen for months
Even without Stimmy where you gonna put your money? Ya'll need to think more like a person managing billions. Where are you going? Bonds? Eh, that trade has been absolute dogshit for 8 solid months. Good luck reporting to your investors you made 6% this year.  Foreign equities? Good luck when Boris shuts everything down and you lose 20%. Know what sucks less than european stock markets? Literally nothing. Commodities! you scream like a proper autist. At best you can hope for sideways and at worst COVID pulls you into a loss for the year.

No friends, the only move is the US stock market. Why? Because COVID pretty much turned tech into the messiah. An tech is having a huge ongoing halo effect on the whole US stock market. COVID resurgent just guaranteed a green year.

Of course there are some risks. I'm not 100% invested because you never can be sure just how full retard the election will go. But to me those are buyable dips. Frankly all that would scare me away at this point is some kind of true deadlock where the election literally has to wait for multiple court decisions. Then I might take a break and wait. But that's pretty unlikely. It will probably be over tonight, effectively, when Biden takes Florida.

Yup, that‚Äôs the risk! It‚Äôs like a losing option play that never leaves your brokerage. 95% of OTC plays are pump and dump trash. Fun to ride the pump on some, but very dangerous because they can be easily manipulated. There are always a few diamonds in the rough that are legit long holds though. If you hit an OTC winner early on, they can be literal millionaire makers. Hard part is finding the right one. Best feeling ever when you hit an OTC home run though (only done it once).

Exit polls only check the people who voted in person, this year that will be more Trump leaning because Biden voters are more concerned about the pandemic and are more likely to have voted by mail or early in person.

In short: be skeptical of exit polls.

If you read how it works, that proposal would also help the poors. Why would they vote against it?
Hillary was the wrong candidate. It seemed as if she felt entitled to the presidency. I wanted Biden to run back then. In 2016 I didn't vote for Trump nor did I vote for Hillary.

Right, right. Now this may come as a shock to you, but the Fed back then did make mistakes. But claiming that they are the sole cause and listening to clowns like Ron Paul just makes you stupider.

People were voting on the idea of Trump. Now they are voting on his first 4 years.

Completely different ballgame.

Also hillary was like the least-liked democrat candidate in decades.

The final factor is that a lot of democrats stayed home last time, because they simply couldn't imagine that Trump could win, so they didn't get fired up. That's also a huge difference this year.

I don't think Dems will keep blocking Trump over stimmy. They'll eventually reach a compromise.
That is statistically true. You can flip a coin a 1000 times and it's still 50/50. Otherwise it's a gambler's fallacy (If I flipped head 4 times in a row, the 5th must be tails), which isn't true.

I mean, a bit of a weird argument to make when the protests literally only existed because the police kneeled on a passive prisoner's neck until he died.
You just ignore how well Asia is doing? There are obvious ways to contain the virus without shutting down the economy.

Agreed. Something to remember is Zodiac is universally unliked and Beto ran a hell of a campaign. Had he not made AWB part of his platform I‚Äôd probably have given him my vote. End of the day this is Texas; we like our guns.

* When he does step down or rip, Harris is probably going to be bad.

Sure thing champ
Tried to go to mangos rally on Sunday in GA. Was turned away due to it being max capacity
the bear thesis for this election is strong, there's few outcomes that won't lead to red:

biden wins, takes senate, blue wave > huge stimmy will pass but that money won't go to corporations, it'll go to states, individuals and small businesses. Corporations will face big tax hikes, high earners will tax hikes, corporate gains tax will face a hike. Big tech potentially gets broken up. More regulations etc.

biden wins, senate remains red > no worry about tax hikes for the short term, but also no hope for stimmy passing and we know how baby reacts without his baa baa

trump wins, house remains blue > 4 more years of inept leadership, no stimmy, covid spirals out of control

no winner announced > market hates uncertainty

can anyone think of a realistic outcome the market won't react negatively to? 

hope you got your puts autists.
I wish there were public stats for how many bans /r/politics is going to give out tonight.  Place is going to meltdown when Trump wins again.
None of this nonsense relates to election results night of election. Dems have conceded every time. So have Repubs.

Mr Dipshit currently in office however has pretty blatantly said he will not accept it
Im in the same position that he is, but strangely it is not a dart that I have in my hand
My middle school brother said at his school, it was 70% Biden vs 25% Trump (5% Green Party). And we live in a suburb that is definitely Republican leaning. Most middle schoolers aren't smart enough to know about the candidates so they definitely got some of their ideas from their parents.

nope, free.  but if you hold shares it locks you out from doing anything while the transfer is taking place.  i couldn't do shit when the market was tanking last week
Were just here to shit talk and hope our bets come true. Dgaf about who wins really.
The only reason I went bearish today is because the fomc is meeting tomorrow and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be good
Cant believe Im saying this, but he would have been a better nominee than Biden imho.
are you retards gonna buy all the toilet paper again

i had to blast my ass clean in the shower for like 3 months
If they‚Äôre short dated I think tomorrow will be high vix and then we will decrease
That could print..  Mine are all December or later...  If earnings crush, we'll both be sitting pretty

Yup, MMEDF is solid. Could see multiple dollars in a year or two. My only other OTC plays right now are INQD and IGEN. Both sub penny right now, so no way they ever get to anything close to multiple dollars, but OTC plays are sometimes fun to buy a few million shares, stash them away, then hit a 50 bagger once in a while (or lose your ass, either way).

But yea keep sticking to your outdated anecdote
I just watched most of it, 10sec skipped all the parts I have seen and remember. I have seen most of these before in full. I will agree there are cases here that the police went too far and those individuals should be held accountable. However, the majority of these were justified, once a riot has been declared and the crowd warned to disperse else physical violence will be used if they don't leave they get pushed and  beat. It is a simple concept to do as you are ordered by the police and you'll be fine

And sure, this would have basically guaranteed a Trump win in 2020, but Trump is probably winning anyway.  It would be better in the long-term though.

There were some posters here that printed from it, but they were telling us to buy the calls like 2 weeks ago. In retrospect it was smart as fuck b/c VXX went from 22 to 27 pretty quick. Hopefully they sold in time tho
Thanks!
Went balls deep in BABA at the 9:45AM fire sale
VXX calls was a dumb choice.  Markets just chilling til the end of the year apparently
Actually I‚Äôm now -100
Not american and dont know who will win. Just someone poor from a shitty country who wants their calls to print. But I have a feeling mango‚Äôs will to win is much higher than sleepy. Seems biden is not that interested.

Yup. I‚Äôm a moderate and I‚Äôm socially liberal. My hyper-liberal friends always point to how other countries can operate with socialist policies.

I tend to agree with you. If I had to bet right now, I'd bet Texas goes trump.

That said, Beto got like 48%+ in the senate race, and senate races have far lower turnout. And, love him or hate him, Trump is driving turnout with his divisiveness. 

Id still bet red, but I honestly wouldn't be 100% shocked if it went blue. It'll be a fascinating one to watch for sure, and it's the state I'm most excited about seeing tonight.

I'm over here in GA, and it's a similar situation. It's actually going to be close, which is pretty crazy.

Okay I counted all of Pennsylvania‚Äôs votes by hand and I can report trump came out on top 420% to 69%
The air is electric. is nuts
I think AOC in her 20s would be awesome, but Ivanka is just awesome at any age.

E: any *legal* age.
That is because there is no breakdown of your income tax on your pay stub like in so many other countries (a lot of places require that). We pay about 65% of our taxes to military. Definitely seems like a bit too much.

Bro no matter how much money you have, you still only get one vote just like the pleebs.

Absolutely 100% horseshit, and it's literally never been done in the history of the united states. Which is why it got shot down, due to the precedent of "voter confidence."

If a state tells people how to vote, and people vote that way, you can't throw them out. Because it's not their fault that some county did something improperly. If the county did something wrong, fine them, or make sure they don't do it again, but you can't throw out votes that were cast as instructed.

They didn't, by the way. As the courts decided, they followed the law.

Republicans were trying to push a technicality that a tent isn't a "structure" to take away the right of 160,000 american citizens right to vote.

But, you did answer my question. As a republican, you support throwing out legitimate votes of your fellow citizens if it helps your side win. 

Thanks for the insight.

Unloaded my FSLY calls today that I've been holding for the past month for a 70% loss. Prepare for moon mission.
I am going to be rich or just slightly down tomorrow. We will see what happens. At least if trump wins i will be rich. If not at least the world will be better.

Couldn‚Äôt have possibly meant stand down could he? Especially since he‚Äôs condemned them more than any president with the exception of Lincoln maybe.
The conspiracy was that Biden will develop health issues and she will be the 1st woman pres.

Trump wins = mass riots

Biden wins = mass shootings

Kanye wins = mass celebrations
Did you read why? It was a simple legalality based on Texas voting law. Before bitching read the whole story. Either side would have done it.
nah its about the raccoon tail
Imo it all depends on what the govt does in the next few days
Oh for sure. I just don‚Äôt think Texas has the numbers to flip just yet. And despite what the right screams about people from other states moving here, it‚Äôs mostly native texans like myself and 2nd generation immigrants that are turning things. The argument itself that its libs moving here is stupid and doesn‚Äôt stand up to scrutiny.

Anecdotal: my brother‚Äôs buddy is pretty well connected in the Dallas political scene and as a never Trump republican, he‚Äôs betting Trump by 1.5-2%.
Sigh. Wrong. Check the White House YT channel, they upload all of them.

Dude u still gained.
Yes, NIU is the electric scooter company. Don‚Äôt just look at share price, look at the market cap. That will give you a better idea of room to grow. NIO sitting at a market cap of almost $50 billion. NIU sitting at $2 billion. A lot of room to grow in the moped and scooter industry in Asia and Europe, which are huge markets right now. Good fundamentals and great products. Flying a bit under the radar right now, but will pick up steam in the next few months. Earnings coming out at end of November, and they have been great the last few quarters. I am holding some March 2021 calls, so probably a bit biased. But check them out.
I posted my comment when spy was 335 and said it would stay flat the rest of the day.
no
At this moment neither as I have no idea how the US Congress will be made up and good luck passing anything substantive regardless knowing their partisanship.

I feel like it was a baby squeeze from the market being green and Biden prospects. I thought about going short when it was around 21-23 so I bet there were others that have added to short interest the last couple weeks.

Trump is only 3 years younger than Biden.
I‚Äôll be surprised if you get a rationale response. I don‚Äôt think people that loooove trump care about democracy. He is inherently anti democracy with his actions.
BABA‚Äôs Jack Ma is the Chinese equivalent to Musk.... Innovating and talking shit w/ the govt and ramping up volatility. Here hoping today was just his version of ‚Äúprice to high IMO‚Äù
No matter the outcome one thing is for sure. 

Trump Daddy will be insufferable after the election. 

If he wins he will gloat, take multiple victory laps and sink deeper into establishment republican/libertarian ideals. 

If he loses he will be on every news show possibly have his own and do nothing but talk shit about Joe Biden for the next 4 years.
You could be if you trained real hard.
I don‚Äôt think so. Why waste all that effort trying to throw out 100k ballots if it‚Äôs a clear republican win. Why spend all that time suppressing votes?
AL Flipping for the Senate sure but Donnie won easily 16. He'll lose MI WI PA maybe AZ OH FL. It's a rap only the Senate races are still interesting.

CGC and TLRY have earnings Friday. Sector is poised, bottom DEFS in. Just saying.

Are you... are you saying the 65+ million votes that will be cast for Biden don‚Äôt count?
[deleted]
Unless Biden wins Florida, which we will know tonight.

In that case, it's basically over tonight.
Where are you getting this information?  I hope you are right.
How sway?
I guess my question how bad will the iv be especially on longer dates calls with low IV to begin with?
[deleted]
So you're saying calls on polarization and puts on unity, got it.
This is the way
Legit non-loaded question to the republicans in this thread: how do you feel about the attempt to throw out 160,000 votes in Houston? Do you support it?

To me, seems like some unamerican shit to try to nullify americans' votes, regardless of your party. Wondering how republicans actually feel about it.
Where are you getting your news from just curious
That's exactly correct. All the maggots say the "plandemic" is just to make him look bad. All he had to do was pretend to be human for a little while and he would actually win in a landslide.

WTF?
Is that calls on Trump or calls on Biden?
All I know is my China mutual fund(tcelx) pumped almost 8% yesterday. Market makers must think Biden is going to win.
Imagine if Trump never inherited his wealth we would‚Äôve never heard of him. We‚Äôd probably be working next to him at Wendy‚Äôs.
Pin this shit nigga
Ron Paul is. That makes him a clown. And that makes his book a joke.

He doesn't have a clue what the Federal Reserve does so him opining that he thinks it caused the depression -- while not mentioning the half dozen or so crashes and depressions that happened before the great depression in the late 19th century.

PLUS the great depression was under the gold standard. He's too fucking stupid to realize that.

But in his defense he sold this snake oil for *years* to gullible suckers, thus getting him in power and sucking off the government teat for ages while accomplishing nothing.
Well... He's going to make it great again, again. That second "again" is a key pillar of the GOP platform.
They did. The general perception of gyna is negative bcoz of the beer flu. üçä has no problem berating gyna and his supporters love that. Chaos is a ladder for a proper leader. üçä is mentally challenged so what to expect.

Also Gyna is much more populated and they managed to contain it, same goes for all the other Asian countries. Singapore, Hongkong are basically the most densely populated places on earth. Look at their numbers.
Gonna be sad to see Trump go from europoor perspective. guy provides me so much entertainment with his nonsense
They can re-sell this companies product....WDOFF

.... No no. The store gets 10 labor hours for Black Friday. One of the fucking prizes is being able to have another person on shift for Black Friday.
Because the deadline for mail in ballots is November 10th and so there is a a chance someone can double vote. So they want to wait and count mail in ballots before they start counting in person votes. If the results are out by the 10th why do they need to count in person votes.

Is that the consensus agreed upon at the last John Birch Society party?

Reminder: the end of voting is tonight, but the election isn‚Äôt over. Whatever counts are announced tonight could change over the next several days as mail in ballots are counted (some states have laws forbidding them from being counted until Election Day). Plus, if there‚Äôs any controversy the process could last up until December (when the electors meet) and possibly even after. 

My advice: the presidential election is not what to watch. Pay attention to the Senate races. If the GOP loses the Senate, then you can be pretty certain how everything turns out. If the GOP retains the Senate, then things could get dicey. 

Also, there is at least one Senate race that is virtually guaranteed to a runoff. Loeffler in GA has a ton of candidates and likely won‚Äôt be resolved tonight (or even this week).

Nah APPS was
Not so sure about Texas...
Trump sowed his fate when he couldn't come up with a new campaign slogan. Every time he said make america great again he was basically punching himself in face

Much smaller. He sounded worried on one interview said he didn‚Äôt have a victory speech planned
These voter analysis polls on Fox News is hilarious. Something you would see on CNN.
That‚Äôs probably not an unfair statement. What also should be considered in the OP is Trump and the GOP were handed a well-oiled machine, then put the fucker in 6th gear and redlined it to the point of throwing a rod through unnecessary tax cuts.
It literally would not be as bad if trump didn't politicize mask wearing and avoiding crowds. The dumbest 30% of our population believes mask wearing is a democrat thing now. Instead of being a leader/proponent of national guidelines, he's also encouraged the dumbest governors to open everything prematurely.... Leading us into the worst possible positioning for this winter, according to Fauci, who he also politicized.
Its a joke fking idiot

Even if they did it would be chalked up as fake news and people would argue amongst each other while the person who did it setup the next city for destruction.

New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Canada, Norway, and many more are doing far better than the US. Still, you have a point, the perception of Trump's performance could've changed if he had embraced the science (and could've saved a few lives along the way).

True.

its gonna dump
you guys are looking at it the wrong way. The stimulus is good. But the real strength of that v shaped rally was because of how much money went to The Fed. With no oversight committee it was just a slush fund to prop up the markets.

Do you really think the same thing is gonna happen again? I would wager that the reason Pelosi couldn't come to a deal was because Mnuchin wanted the same kinda deal as last time. markets will bounce on stimulus news sure. but not like you're thinking.

Almost as bold as the guy who sold his house to buy NIO shares
Just show some photo of him rolling up the sleeve and carrying some boxes around with a caption 'fighting pandemic'. His supporters would have sucked it up. But he is all about winning. So lets see if he goes full RREEEEE today.
The open interest on spxs 11/20 contracts  is fucking insane holy smokes lol
Wouldn't it be great if people could stop electing senior citizens to be president. They should be playing bingo or golf or whatever old fucks do
I think Trump will win and I bought puts.
Reminder! wsb poll
https://strawpoll.com/2oobxpz3p
Wtf why they tracking me?
loud minority
In what scenario would that happen though?  Biden being a clear winner and Trump throwing a fit even before all votes are counted even though it wouldn't make a difference?  

Trump clearly winning?  Figured that'd make it go up myself

It being a close election and now we have to wait for all mail in votes to be counted and it takes days, possibly weeks?  Sounds like that wouldn't hurt tomorrow too bad but maybe a slow bleed?  

I put 1k on SPY puts near the close today at 339 and 336 expiring tomorrow and even I'm questioning in what scenario am I going to print here and ready to lose it all.

Wait UVXY always will go down long term. That's actually a known fact. Take a look at it from 2010. It reverse splits a lot to keep the price in the same range but if you take out the reverse splits it will drop long term (it's actually in the prospectus - this and VXX will say "it goes to 0 long term"). 

The SVXY drop is different. It dropped in 1 day not long term. Basically VIX temporarily went over 100 on a day in February 2018. I believe if you google something like 2018 volmageddon, you'll find some articles about it.

genuinely asking, why do you think that's the case? I would imagine a Biden admin would be much more friendly to solar than Trump. Biden doesn't have to win Texas

I think a trump win, we‚Äôll still see Biden contesting the election
15k USD in SPY calls, 100x leverage..  


Am I stupid?
Have you seen this election? The blatant voter suppression is sickening, the right to vote in a fair election is a huge one

His conservative judges are now set to remove the rights for healthcare, gay marriage and choice

The right to justice and fair trial regardless of the colour of your skin

The right to information and free speech, he‚Äôs already said fauchi is on the chopping block if he wins. He actively downplays or straight removes anyone who opposes him.
Forever?? No one will care once he‚Äôs out of office, not even him
This is the only DD I needed to remind myself that NIO puts was a good idea.
All of them over the next 4 years probably
Fuck both candidates just give us a clear winner so we can rocket
Just wait, trump wins in landslide, SPY hits 420 couple hours later. Fuckin book it
That‚Äôs right. Stocks are first priority and riots are bad for stocks
GG Portland
SUPN +15% AHü§ô
This meme is so fucking bad its fucking great
Regarding the beer virus, everybody fucked up. Including Europoors. Only the Asians (Koreans, Japanese, Singapore) did good. Learn from the Asians. They have strict mask mandate and social distancing which the people actually follow. Also do you hear any protest against mask wearing in Asia?

But it doesn't matter. üçä could have easily done a huge PR stunt running around doing photo-op fighting the pandemic. Showing his face blaming gyna (which he has no problem doing) would have done wonders. But instead he was like if you bury your head in the sand there is no pandemic. Also no mask extreme right, against health officials approach might have costed him this election.
[deleted]
It doesn't. These people are retarded and have no idea what they're talking about.
Thou I have to say, $30 calls didn't even exist back then, like would if I bought $15 calls, would I have been making the same amount of money? Don't fully understand the Greeks yet.
QCOM and INTC puts. 100% AAPL sells their chips to other laptop/desktop makers.
I normally post anti trump memes on social media. but today was the first time the trumpsters took it personally. Biden confirmed
SBE
Just about every blue one
Seeking endorsements from Soundcloud rappers to begin with is desperate and embarrassing. Then you have to go and boomer up the name when you pull them on stage. lol what a buffoon
I think cannabis and gun stocks cover pretty much both scenarios
I dropped 1% of my portfolio on a bottle of wine. $4 wine isn‚Äôt too bad
SF for sure
I was planning on becoming a millionaire by 2022, but if Biden wins I think I‚Äôm going to just ride this local government $65k/yr job out until retirement.  

Not worth paying the extra taxes.
do trump supporters here actually just want america to fail faster or do yall think he's genuinely done a good job?
Sure but National guard doesnt mean marital law.

Theyre just getting ready for antifa/BLM protests that usually end up with looting and fires
LOOL I meant I need someone declared the winner tonight
Step one.  Change name

Step two. Run for office.
agreed
no im saying likely trump win and rioters/looter demo protests
Thought so! Let me guess, it's all fraud and fake news when Biden wins.
Ummm don't forget about a massive crash...I assume we'd be up way more if that didn't happen.
How is everyone positioned for tomorrow?  Upvote Long. Downvote Short.
Hows the vibe in here? For real Biden is such a favourite he has to win it right
Operating margins across the country are quite strong because of all the layoffs.
Uvxy calls checking in
Pot stocks... supposedly therell be quicker legalization of MJ under a Biden win
So you‚Äôre making a lot of bad decisions like any other dummy with money lmao
Nah i think texas will be sleepy
But that‚Äôs logical so maybe down
Biden = stability, covid management, stimulus = green.
Let‚Äôs go joe you sleepy fuck!!  Make my ICLN print
Bruh did you not see any of the daily press conferences from Trump? Lol. They were from March until August afaik everyday
Diamond hands
So how many cities are going to burn down if Trump wins?
So consensus is Trump win = riots + green market. Biden win = Trump contesting election integrity forever + red market.

What happened to him and the Trump Towers in Chicago isn‚Äôt unheard of. It happens from time to time. Sometimes banks go fuck it, it might be better to let this loser keep it than to lose even more money trying to sell it to another party.
It worked fine for Fred Flintstone
will be -20% tomorrow
Yeah what explained to me how mango got into office was the fact that 48% of people believe in ghosts. Damn some people are fucking stupid
Isnt NIO chinese backed? No way to go red right now.
I have seen 2 posts on FB of Trumpets promising to "take the country by force" if Biden wins.
Yes
Fuck you
It's okay, nio gains make everything else looks like pennies
Yep confirmed.  That's the smallest pee pee I've ever seen and it's already gooey too.

You can use his name in this thread you know

The market just wants a clear winner. I doubt it truly care much which one. 

What it doesn't want is uncertainty for days or weeks.

So if we get a solid winner tonight, it's up tomorrow.
Oh nice. Good luck bro
Yeah you were.  I certainly wasn‚Äôt going to bet against it.
I‚Äôm somehow still in the green thanks to Nio. Should I liquidate everything and go cash gang? Market may tank tomorrow
Just weird it was up today and all of sudden started going down

No everybody fucked up. Including Europoors. Only the Asians (Koreans, Japanese, Singapore) did good. Learn from the Asians. They have strict mask mandate and social distancing which the people actually follow. Also do you hear any protest against mask wearing in Asia?

If we limit down tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to give out a few gift cards for chicken nuggies.
Assuming Mango loses, that Deutsche Bank story will be interesting to watch unfold.
Looking at the weekly chart, SPY closed directly below the 9 week moving average of 336.7.  Seems to be a strong area of support/resistance. 

Could be interesting if it gets rejected
Hes not big enough, hes Hillary Clintons corpse puppet like that horror movie dead silence
Trump's lackey's may successfully suppress enough votes across the country to tilt it his way, you mean.
Do you think their would actually be hardcore riot if either one of them win?

Me too I went to the electric college, I know all about it.
NO, we weren't. That's whole point. 

Tons of people were out of work, underpaid, limited potential, slowing economic growth.

BUT there was the LOWEST Black unemployment ever!!!!

Just because Black people had the highest number of jobs ever at walmart and mcdonalds doesn't mean people (black or white or asian) etc are actually making any money.

A "job" doesn't mean making money. 

Minimum wage is the lowest "actual" value money its ever been. 

Hardly anyone anywhere can afford a 1 bedroom apart. 

How you grow an economy is simple, pay people, the poorest people, more money. Then unsurprisingly, they spend all that money. Then that money gets spent by the people who got that money for goods and services spend it, and then next people spent again and again. 

And that creates expansion. This creates demand. Demand, demands more supply, demand for supply creates demand for factories and labor and jobs and good paying jobs. 

That results in companies being formed and stocks going up. 

Tickle down economics is for idiots who don't know how economics works. 

Its all about trickle up economics.
What is this? An IPO for ANT?
If Biden wins Florida or Texas it doesn't matter who PA votes for. Biden will be the winner tonight.
Bro. They are returning the ANT ipo money to investors. It‚Äôs literally done. Not ‚Äúin waiting‚Äù like it‚Äôs entirely cancelled. MAYBE some time in the next two years we will see the IPO or maybe never again. It‚Äôs done for now.

Pennsylvania has said it wont declare winner for 3 days.

And AG said "even if all the votes are counted trump cant win"

Which is some political fuckery, and is gonna call the state into question.

From that point. News outlets have said they might not declare a winner tonight.

This means continuously selling small and closer to expiration call and put credit spreads around your positions to eliminate your max pain risk and also make up for any liquidity issues in the near term.

&#x200B;

Because this is an extremely bullish view on XME, in the short term you could sell weekly call credit spreads or put credit spreads (iron condor) in strikes that have deltas at around 0.10. This allows you to slowly offset your financial exposures.

>Your rare examples

Yours was a rare example. Out of the millions and millions of BLM protestors, what % were burning down buildings? If they were all burning down buildings, the US would literally have no more buildings.

A handful of buildings set ablaze as a result of tens of millions of people protesting. So, probably like 0.0000001% of the protestors were rioting, if you do the math. Yet you are calling every single one of then rioters. 

There are thousands of videos of mass gatherings of protests being peaceful, yet you only see the video where some dude smashes a window. 

Youre just biased.

DNC choosing to nominate a VP candidate that received exactly zero delegates. In my mind, this VP candidate is more important than in any other recent year given Biden won't be running the country. For a frame of reference, the democratic populace was more interested in Gabbard who won one  delegate. They pulled this shit (not listening to voters) in 2016 and are pulling it again in 2020.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...

If you want to long SVXY long term, it would benefit if there was a slow drop - flat movement of VIX over time. Basically you don't want any VIX spikes. 

Zoom out max years on SVXY. 2016-2018 is where there was just a slow drop - flat VIX and that's how SVXY went up so much. 

Then you had the volpocalypse in Feb 2018 and SVXY lost basically everything. You pretty much should never be long SVXY for more than 2 weeks. 2016-18 was a huge exception and is not normal.
Just because they failed doesn't mean they didn't try. They've been bringing every lawsuit they can and trumps been railing against mail in voting for months.

Here, I'll post it again:

Over the last fifty years, economists have settled on some very broad areas of consensus. The first is, as famous libertarian monetary economist Milton Friedman wrote, "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon". When the supply of money outstrips the demand, prices rise. And this is by no means limited to fiat currencies; see the great Spanish inflation of the 16th & 17th centuries, thanks to the steady influx of gold from the New World. Or check out the price of basic commodities in mining towns during the Gold Rush, when all anyone had was gold.

The second is that a little bit of inflation is okay--possibly even beneficial, since it helps the economy to overcome the problem of sticky wages when the relative value of labour has fallen. But a lot of inflation is very, very bad. Exhibit A is Zimbabwe; Exhibits B-‚àû are every other economy that has had inflation near or above the double-digit mark; the higher the inflation, the worse the economy did. The feeling that the currency will experience an unpredictable amount of inflation dampens the willingness of the citizens to save and invest, which is why so many third-world loans are denominated in dollars.

The third is that deflation is also bad, and at the lower percentage values, often even worse than inflation. This surprises/offends/meets with the frank disbelief of many "sound money" types, who think that, barring local shortage, in an ideal world everything ought to cost the same or less than it did when Grandpa was a boy. (These sorts of opinions are cemented further by the fact that Grandpa, who is often the source of them, is usually living on a fixed income, and therefore feels that he would make out better in a deflationary economy.) The problem is, deflation does rather devastating things to anyone who has debt, since they now have to repay what they borrowed in more expensive dollars. Deflation means that, thanks to the abovementioned sticky wages, the economy has to deal with demand shocks by lowering output. Deflation can result in what's known as a liquidity trap, a concept pioneered by liberal economist John Maynard Keynes and best elucidated by liberal economist Paul Krugman back before he left economics writing to focus on his hatred of George W. Bush. Deflation is what made the Great Depression so memorable. Deflation is so bad that almost everyone agrees that moderate inflation, in the range of 1-2%, is better than risking even a small amount of deflation.

And no, it's not Ron Paul's childlike religion of "free markets" that makes him a racist -- he's a well known racist and has been for decades. 

And the gold standard is *by definition* deflationary.

Yes, that's why you take hundred of polls and combine all the data to create a very large sample size and remove as much bias as possible. You cannot ever predict the future, but statistics are a very accurate science.

It's so clear that some of you people have never taken a statistics class. You think people just walk around asking people who they are voting for and tally checkmarks, lmao.

There are very accurate mathematical ways to test how accurate a sample will apply to a larger population, and when you have hundreds of samples, you can make very accurate predictions. This is why 2016 was an extreme outlier, as presidential polls, historically, are almost always right.

Yes, some people will just straight up lie in a survey, but any decent model will control for that. 

I have a degree in statistics and am fluent in R data modeling, and it irks me to no end when people have no faith in statistics but also have no idea how it works. They just distrust it based on a gut feeling or some shit

It's not analysis. It's a throwaway comment but if you look at pretty much everything this sub hyped at the IPO stage palantir did absolutely nothing in comparison. For a company that's all about tech (data manipulation/consolidation/analysis) and government contracts I'd say a 5% drop from its IPO is an extremely lukewarm reaction from the market.

Looking at the chart she's definitely chugging away so I wouldn't be too worried about any options/shares you have (unless the options are retarded like 11/10 30c or some shit).

Compound decay. They aren't inverses of each other. If VIX (which is what all the products are related to) goes from 15 to 50 and then back to 15, SVXY is fucked.

Think about it as you have 1k. You lose 90% of it but then you make back 300%. You still only have way less than 1k. It's a "similar idea" with SVXY but then you add in the daily decay along with it and it's basically a product you should never hold for more than 2 weeks.

Imagine staying cash.

Benjamin excellent response!! Never hurts to get very specific. While you're discusing Volga add to it Vanna and explain for this discussion how they relate to Volatilty. Much appreciated üòÅüëç join the discord if you like
Realistically, how far could VXX fall after the election, assuming a winner is declared?  pre-COVID levels?

So CNN giving an exit poll now. But isn‚Äôt that flowed since it takes in-person voters into account only and those are more likely to vote trump?
Good luck. I am not sure how enjoyable it would be though

What are you talking about Trump is the worst for spreading disinformation and denial of truth. He‚Äôs all about shitting on your rights and freedoms. There‚Äôs a reason ANTIFA is riled up for the first time ever and that because he‚Äôs trying to be a facist dictator and we all know how those end. If you really want an Orwellian nightmare vote for Trump, you‚Äôll never see another election.
Ok now I'm worried
Perfect setup for a ER moon
Doesn't protect him from the States though.
No good bookie in Canada. I'm in on Trump but was not able to put size in it.
Is tonight going to be the episode where they're in a stance powering up, and you have to wait another week to actually watch the fight?

I anticipate this to be exactly to be like DBZ... you expect to tune in to watch the showdown, and they're just smack talking all night powering up their kamehamehas.

Couldn‚Äôt the under-allocation to that they point to be attributed to pension fund mandates and low boomer risk tolerance? 

They cite lower compared to historical allocations, but boomers also got older and hold all the wealth.
Nah. He issued a cease and desist to his campaign and Trump responded by threatening to sue him for using his name  in the song and uncollected royalties. Mac didn‚Äôt win anything.

Come on cannabis stocks
Nope, a covered call is a call you've sold (you're short that call) but you own the underlying stock to sell if the call you're short gets exercised. 

Being long a naked call is just buying a call. 

Being short a naked call is selling the call, without owning the underlying shares. Being short naked calls is the options play with the highest theoretical risk, since no matter what the stock jumps to, you have to buy the shares, and then sell them at the price of the call you're short.

Everything is the same for puts, except that there are no covered puts, instead there are cash secured puts, which means you have enough money to buy the shares at the strike price you sold the put for.

And a naked short put is theoretically less dangerous than a naked short call, since a stock can only drop to 0.

There is definitely going to be some unrest, some rioting, a few incidents tonight and the next few days. But the only people who think a "civil war" is coming are fat rednecks living in the woods who don't live close enough to anyone they can fight, and a bunch of 18 year old self-proclaimed commies who are actually just larpers and will run at the first time they get tear gassed. Life will go on and we'll all continue to lose money
Same in 2016 as well. I just refuse to give into this garbage of "lesser of 2 evils". Trump is trash, but im no Biden fan either.

#\#ICantBearAnymore
it depends  on your strategy. If you held it all last week it would  have been wise because it slowly grew from monday to  friday as the market performed poorly. 

I  would  say a week is  probably  max for my comfort level. Buying shares  or calls on VIX tickers is the same as buying  puts on  SPY or QQQ. If you're more comfortable with that  then  maybe that's the best  thing  to  do.
Lol bro
**Important:**

The **day** after GW Bush election day, QQQ dropped 5.4%.

The **day** after Obama election day, QQQ dropped 5.5%.
Noooooo. What are we going to do?! This place won't be the same.

Well you can't trust every poll. Some polls are absolute garbage.

But also wasn't that like way before the election? It was probably accurate-ish at the time. He gained massive ground in the weeks running up to election day.

I remember checking fivethirtyeight and the odds weren't that crazy leading into election day.
Yeah most retards like him
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre the only one
Nice
Your rare examples amount to public nucience, and a case of road rage though. The other side is by the literal dictionary definition conducting acts of terror. They are also destroying black communites and businesses, gang bashing anyone who disagrees with them. Stealing looting, and it goes on every night for months.

I'm not American, I'm watching for the sidelines and appalled people are making excuses for this behaviour. If the MAGA crowd acted like that I'd call em out too. Nobody should be able to break the law with impunity.
It's for investment retards though, not gambling retards.
Isnt he already the presumed winner? I would think a reversal would buck the current market trend.

Most certainly Biden. The largest group of voters in 2016 was people that didn't vote at all. Then Hillary. And then Trump in 3rd. (Going by popular vote). A lot of people that sat out because they hated Hillary are more chill with Biden

Bye bye Trump. Cause a scene, I want the crash
Wow ü•≠ looks like he thinks he's done honestly. It's kinda sad in a way
You dipshits always go to that one when in fact nobody is saying that. What people identify as and what they biologically are are obviously two different things. One is science and one is a feeling. Teaching kids that people are different and we shouldn‚Äôt be shitty to them just because of that isn‚Äôt brainwashing either, it‚Äôs just not being an asshole.

It doesn't man, his school started remote for a month and we can tell it wasn't gonna cut it so as soon as they set up to open we went in. Hes young only kindergarten but nothing like having a teacher. Plus hes tired of me teaching his ass for the pas few years lol

Ah the ‚Äòol paper hands leading to a paper divorce
This is pretty terrible analysis. It‚Äôs already trading at like 5 year future value. I‚Äôd say ws is pretty hot on it.
I think it was more bemoaning the fact the electoral college voted for the wrong candidate again.  I would understand it if Donald Trump was smarter or better-looking than Hillary, it was just the fact he weaponized facebook to win that really irks me.
if you've had chicken pox then the herpes virus is already inside you!

Their just doing this for clicks and publicity. That would imply trillions of dollars of inflow into the overall market, which is unlikely given overall volume has been down since March when compared to the same time period in 2019.
just need some positive news for the challenger and AH will tank

Sure it may have mixed reviews but it‚Äôs a platform which actually empowers individuals. Some thing 95% of stocks on the market don‚Äôt do with the exception of Uber etc.
I mean my personal opinion is that the email scandal like 2 days before the election fucked up everything and made the previous polls obsolete. And that the polls were far more accurate before that. 

But I really don't wanna get into all that.
you gonna sell any options with that?
this is better than any movie

QCOM earnings tomorrow AH

Lots of unusual whale call buying activity yesterday and today that went under the radar

FTC lost bid to revive antitrust case vs Qualcomm

QCOM's new 5nm chip leaked benchmark AnTuTu test revealed that the 875 chip reached a score of 847,000 points. Significantly higher than Apple's A14 Bionic at only 572,133 points.

QCOM's founder, former chairman, and largest shareholder Irwin Jacobs is a democratic super donor.

Qualcomm heiress, Sara Jacobs is a lock to win US rep seat and is backed by millions from Irwin Jacobs.

No mention of QCOM on wsb this week.

What does all of this mean? QCOM üöÄüöÄüöÄ
So how come it did that? Still trying to figure that one out. I thought amd wanted to purchase them?

If the economy falls apart then there is no market. 

Trump doesn't have the mental capacity to create a growing successful economy.

And I'm just basing this off all the people he keeps hiring and then firing like two weeks later. 

Like DUDE just hire actual smart people and ask them questions and then use what they say. He literally hires idiots and then argues  with them when he is in meetings like he is the smartest person in the room. 

That's not how you successfully lead anything. You want to be the LEAST smart person in the room, not a not-smart person, but have your advisors be even smarter than you. 

Then listen to them. 

So, simply TWO things Trump is bad at are actually hiring smart/good people as advisors and listening to them in meetings.

That's how you get a faltering economy, which results in a faltering stock market.
If Coty reports a decent quarter on November 6 and there's vaccine news this month, its going to ramp up to $6+ again in short time. Nordstrom probably $20+ again. And Pfizer calls because that's who I am betting on comes out with the best news first. This industry in stocks are still incredibly hammered but I dont think its as bad as the prices reflect.

COTY Jan $4c

PFE March $41c

JWN Jan $17.5c

tech salaries have gone up because of the stock market bull run -- FAANG which pays heavily in stocks which have relatively mooned, and then other firms competing for talent and driving salaries up valley-wide. for example, FB stock was $26 in 2013, now its $260. thats why you can make 350k as a 27 year old at facebook rn, and why Lyft or whatever will pay that much as well (because they have to compete)

pretty sure the stock market bull run is continuation from Obama, not anything Trump policy related. 

so im a bit confused at what you mean, what exact policies are you talking about?

You think saying "its vapid and wrong" is a detailed critique? 

>Here's another point, and I can keep them coming at you: Let's say that we're in deflation like your ideal world of Ron "I'mafuckingracistclown" Paul. But let's pretend for a moment that a vagina doctor was right about economics

Hey dipshit, in the book he says deflation is a bad thing. Idk if you know this, but the federal reserve thought deflation was a good thing and that's what made the Great Depression so bad at the start. 

Idk how believing in free markets and freedom makes someone racist. Oh, you must be a lefty. That's the only way someone can make such a leap.

What's the opposite of confirmation bias? It fell from 90 a few weeks ago for pretty much no reason and has been hovering around 60 since. I'd say the major factor is whether or not it does well on earnings (Nov. 17).

Yo real talk people who think Trump is gonna win because the pOlLls WeRe WrOnG lAsT tImE are legit braindead. They weren't wrong, the less likely event just happened. If someone gives Trump a 40% chance of winning, it's not "wrong" when he wins. He had a 40% chance.


Let's say I have a 10-sided die and 8 of the 10 sides are painted blue. 2 of the 10 sides are red. 

I'd tell you "there's an 80% chance this lands on blue."

If I rolled it and it landed on red, you retards would literally bet that it lands on red the next time because "statistics were wrong last time!"

Oouch. Hope it bounces back. Good luck buddy.
Got ¬£500 on Biden but for my stocks I'm sure Trump will be better for me.. dont mind either way as a UK resident.
Might crash tomorrow due to a contested election so I suppose we will all see.  Medium term the market will rise as regardless as who wins we will get stimulus and a vaccine in the coming months.
Let it be so--I have SPXS calls and UVXY puts, and having my play and my hedge both hit would be a real gift.  Which candidate must I vote for to see this happen?

Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôm already debt free but I‚Äôll probably buy another car for the collection so I don‚Äôt have the itch. 

It‚Äôs terrible I was up 40k on my RH end of September when I start back again. Back to almost even at this point. First time I‚Äôve ever gone on such a bad losing streak. Seriously thinking it‚Äôs time to count my blessing on a 100k year from practically nothing and move on with my life. Leaving the stock market behind me.

Make Biden America Again
It'd be split 50/50
It's not like he had a prepared speech ever in the past four years
The simulation ends. That's one of the exit conditions.
By 2050... and he didn't even say get rid of oil, just carbon neutral. If they can make tech to reduce their emissions or clean CO2 from the air then they will be allowed to stay. In addition, investing heavily in green energy infrastructure will lower our energy cost over time and cement our status as the best economy for another 50 years

Got pulled over twice within 20 minutes for speeding on I-80 on my way back to Notre Dame from PA around 2:00am after Christmas vacation.  Smoked pot 5-10 minutes before EACH pull over I kid you not. 

The first guy let me off with a warning, citing how Ohio St beat ND in football and he feels bad for me. 

The second guy, after coming back to my car, asked ‚ÄúDid you get pulled over in Ohio already today?‚Äù

To which I responded, ‚ÄúYes, sir, about 20 minutes ago‚Äù.   He also let me off. Couldn‚Äôt believe it.  They obviously weren‚Äôt hunting for white college students. 

I always thought cops in Ohio were such assholes but those guys were cool.
From reading these comments, it's clear you are all as good at predicting election outcomes as you are at predicting whether the market will go up or down tomorrow.

A lot of you retards forgot Biden was Delawares senator(you know the place where a lot of you stonks are incoporated in) for 36 years. I swear Republican/Trumpers have memories of gold fish. He is going to be good for the stock market. Time to load up on calls.
Literally says on their website that they want to take them away. Let‚Äôs your research?
No
Minor nitpick: Volga and VVIX are not interchangeable.

Volga is the partial derivative of Vega with respect to IV, which when evaluated at a point gives a linear approximation near that point. VVIX is merely a statistic calculated from the parameters of a basket of near-term VIX options with nonzero bid as explained in the CBOE white paper.

Anyway, I've been a net vol seller this week myself, but legging into short puts/calls at separate times in separate tickers. Good luck.

NBC just interviewed a guy who voted for Trump and they asked why they chose Trump.

No lie, his response was that he hated how America was currently viewed and laughed at by the rest of the world and he thought Trump was the best candidate to help correct that.

I'm not saying Trump won't win, just your dad must be a tool if he was impressed by the past 4 years of Trump/Republicans and decided to vote Rep for the first time.
Oof, the odds are pretty rough. Might drop $300 on Biden to win the whole thing, but I'm worried Trump will say/do some crazy shit to invalidate the bet.

Ya that stuff shows just how desperate they are to inject liquidity and, imo, is a huge moral hazard.  They aren't allowed to directly buy bonds from the treasury to pay for stimulus checks but they can give disney a few billion to help their balance sheet after a decade of corporate stock buybacks
Holy shit mango would have a meltdown and barricade himself in the white house after the house decides the tie breaker for Biden.

I got lucky and sold when the stock was flat today for a 50% profit. Might re-enter the same trade with next week's expiration if continues to drop. Earnings was good and I think will set a new floor on the stock price.
Imho Donny cutting corporate tax rate had by far the biggest impact on markets since 2016. Ppl here who started investing think the last 7 months is a real market. The fact is the market was a rocket ship 2019

What is the maximum length should you hold SQQQ? 3 day? Week? Month?
But they've already asked all the wall street CEOs about this, and their answer is clear: increased economic expansion under Biden would offset increased taxes, which makes him completely neutral for stocks.

On the other side of the coin, contracted expansion under Trump offsets his reduced taxes, making him neutral for stocks. 

They wouldn't be forking cash over to Biden if they actually thought he was going to fuck their bottom line.

This is the biggest joke ever.  All the countries in the world are FUCKED.   Nobody and I mean nobody has any clue on how we stop printing money.  No country has figured out what they are going to do.  Covid is now forcing us and most other countries to print even more money and this has nothing to do with who the president is.

So fuck it.  Lower all taxes and keep printing money. I will take all the gains and when the music stops, I will be happy to short the market and sit on my piles of cash.  Fuck everyone else.  That is the way it works.

It is so fucken hard to make money.  Investors should never give a shit about anything other than how they will make more money and then keep it!!!

And if Trump sucks.  Why the fuck have we had stellar returns over the past 4 years.  Why did we get to 3% unemployment???  

Having said all that, if Biden wins and the market goes up then great I will take that as well but if he fucks this up with left bullshit then the music stops and the party ends too early.
In 2016 the market fell hard the week before election, during election week: fukin green dildo all week.  BULLISH
Since I'm not a 1%er, I guess I know which party is better for me. Thanks.

I dont follow politics much but I put a shitton of money down on a Biden win. If it hits, I'll be posting some massive gain porn (or loss porn if he loses). Anyone know if those type of gain/loss porns would be allowed or is it "too political" for the gay mods in here?

The only way it will get that high is if the dollar legit shits the bed. If that is the case, it means the gains are barely gains.
Biden will increase capital gain taxes for 1MM+ incomes.  I know that won't affect anyone here, but it's quite bad for stonks.
What the fuck is a semi-progeressive liberal?  Isn't that just a liberal?
They literally go to voting sites and ask people who just voted "who did you vote for?" It's supposed to be super accurate but they were wrong last time.

So your way is just going against people you don‚Äôt like. In fact it‚Äôs the majority of voters that you don‚Äôt like. The republicans want their voters to vote and nobody else. It‚Äôs the reason they block so many voters through a bunch of voter suppression. You‚Äôre an imbecile. Why shouldn‚Äôt the person with the most votes win? Oh yeah cause most people are democrats? Go fuck off you fucking retarded mongoloid.

That's what the car companies want you to think. The real reason is access to credit. They cost more because we'll pay more. No really. 

Boston Fed:
>everything came together in the 1920s: mass production, electrification, highway construction, mass communication, the expansion of consumer financing.
Auto manufacturers perfected assembly line production and began to turn out cars at a price that would ‚Äúput the middle class on wheels.‚Äù
Public investment in a federal highway system helped to expand the market even further.
Other manufacturers adapted assembly line techniques to produce affordable home appliances and consumer electronics: ovens, refrigerators, washing machines, phonographs, radios, telephones. And investment in the utility infrastructure ‚Äî electrical power grid, phone lines, water and sewer systems ‚Äî helped to bring these products into more homes. But the catalyst ‚Äî the thing that helped to bring all these industrial and technological marvels within the reach of so many consumers ‚Äî was the expanded use of installment credit. The big breakthrough came in 1919 when General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) became the first to make financing available to middle-income car buyers. Instead of having to come up with the entire purchase price, prospective car buyers needed only a down payment and an income that was big enough to cover monthly payments over the life of the loan.

Joe Biden's tax increases are pretty modest, and I don't believe he will ever get them done anyway. Obama didn't really mess with Bush's taxes. Joe Biden isn't even proposing to raise corporate taxes back to where they were under Obama which is hilarious to me.
Also, lots of shares.

Damn what odds did you get?
If you think a Trump win = drill and that Biden stim is priced in, why would you buy calls? Neither situation moons. No one knows how the market will react to either candidate winning.
Lmao what an idiot
That is the official bag holder narrative, its ok suckholes a blue wave is gooood, here try some soylent green. The 1 and only benefit to blue wave is massive stimmy.

Who is brave enough to admit they are a registered Republican and voted for Sleepy?  Awards if you say your state.

Edit: Again, read the question. You get no award if you claim to be a democrat voting for Trump.
I just need to know about the tit part.
Feeling like this was a big bull trap today. They dump this down to 310 then rocket to 380 by December.
Only way I can see it helping is that once this shitshow is over stim is coming. Doesnt matter who wins though.

Honestly, it would be bad. That's the actual answer. People here like to shitpost that a Trump win will rally the market, but it's nonsense.


Wall Street backed Biden, and he's so far ahead in the polls that him winning has been priced in for months. There's no way that an unexpected upset would rally the market. At least in the short term, it would crash as all the big money pulls out and re-evaluates their strategy. Longer term is anyone's guess. 

This is pretty unlikely to actually happen though.
For the people saying I could have held you might be right but the screenshot doesn't tell the whole story, I have more than one position in NIO. I also have CSPs and diagonal spreads, been playing with this ticker since before it was dropping down to sub 2 dollars.

People will always be taking profits. You can look at my posts as well. I raised money today.  It is not rocket science.   The market has moved up strong over the past two days. Somebody had to be buying and people that bought the dip should be taking SOME profits.

I might be the smartest person here but I made more money in the past month than I had before.   Not sure everyone is in the same boat.

My Great Grandfather  on my Mom's side was buying stock on margin, sold out a few months before the crash and bought a trolley line in Louisville Kentucky.

He thought that people would need to get to work, but couldn't afford or might have to sell cars.

Eventually it turned into a bus line, and he sold it in the 60's or 70's.

Buying it kept the family afloat, as he was an attorney, and they didn't have to move.

Annoying that you have to open the actual ticker and uncheck the box to remove it from the watchlist on RH. Should make it where you swipe right and gives you the option to delete it. POS UI

Next time I gain above $20k I'm just taking the difference out in cash and spending it on stupid shit...
For MBS ya, fed has printed around 2 trillion on their balance sheet last time I checked.  However, for stimulus, the treasury will give the fed bonds to auction.  As far as my understanding goes the fed then sells them to the primary dealers.  So now the fed has the primary dealer's money.  The fed will give that money to the treasury.  So, in the end, the treasury got its money out of the pockets of primary dealers.  The fed then buys those bonds back from the open market, usually from banks, and gives them illiquid reserves in return.  Hence no money was printed during the process.  Now sometimes the fed will buy from someone that isn't a bank and they will have to print money to buy it, but broadly speaking they don't really print
Sht I was planning on selling my UPS / ATVI calls during power hour but I was on the phone and missed it...

Pouring one out for you braddah
I remember when everyone was doubting BABA too.
The day that happened, the board was full of "trump is dead to me". There was never the same reaction to pelosi. And the fact is that it's clear that tweet caused that crash, market was going up until the minute of that tweet. The pelosi stuff was kinda wish washy.

I sold a $113 call against my AAPL shares right at the last minute. My buy price is around where it is now. I really wish I'd sold when it was over $130.
Negative interest for me. It's almost like I'm paying them money to keep my money
I have calls but being a Bear is so much more fun as a gambler. Red candles are so much longer and angrier and faster. Nothing like the rush of having puts on a giant dump.

I gotta wait another hour in Texas ..
Nah just the threat of it. But yes this would be ideal for my rh balance
My sole reason for voting Biden is because I am tired of a fear mongering, divisive leader. Everyone needs to chill the fuck out. And all the people complaining about tax increases almost certainly do not meet the income threshold to be affected, unless they bought NIO at $4
I LUH Y'ALL
I don't have guns nor do I use weed.  Someday I will get a gun I guess.  Hopefully whatever happens this market keeps going for another year.  We will have to pay for all this stimulus at some point and it will be dark days.  Printing money has never been a way to grow to prosperity.

We just need to be out by then and shorting the market.
buy high, sell low...nice
Damn
This I can get behind
What were you thinking with BABA p‚Äôs? Earnings?
Cash account: you can make more than 3 roundtrips per 5 business days. No margin. No immediate settlement of trade.

Margin account: pdt for <25k account, immediate settlement of trade. Margin.
Tax free gains and you still have an account that'd PDT in America? Stupid europoors.

I'm pissed boys. I use ToS, but I've been using RH lately to try it out. 

tried to roll out my puts at close. Sold them, then put in a buy order and shit just fucking froze for like 45 seconds and didn't fill.

So now I only have $2k of FD puts when I wanted like $30k.


Not as bad as holding calls like a dongus, but still. The missed gains due to this shitty-ass app are gonna be painful.


I try to make excuses for RH, but it is just legit impossible to not get fucked using this shit. Gotta go back to ToS full time.

Bought these today. https://i.imgur.com/c7EZOxx.jpg
I posted a detailed critique but you didn't give any substantive answer. 

Huh. 

Here's another point, and I can keep them coming at you: Let's say that we're in deflation like your ideal world of Ron "I'mafuckingracistclown" Paul. But let's pretend for a moment that a vagina doctor was right about economics. 

Why do you think that a small level of inflation is necessary? Let's say you're making money from a pool of a roughly fixed amount of national gold. Every year the economy grows and the gold grows more scarce because more people are needing to use it. That's deflation. 

If you didn't have at least some inflation you could put your money in your mattress and come out ahead every single year. That would be bad as that money would not be invested in the economy. Do you now understand why some inflation is necessary, to motivate people to NOT hold their cash, but to invest it and spend it into the economy?

Send me more stimulus, pay for my college, erase any student loans I already took out, give me an extra 600/week in unemployment so I can bet it on NIO.

Some of y‚Äôall shady as fuck.
Are these old ones left over from before the reverse split? If so they‚Äôre non standard options - instead of 100 shares they‚Äôre good for 8 shares - and nobody wants them. You can execute but I‚Äôm not doing the math on whether that is a good idea or not. Consider it homework.
Show up to court with your all time PnL chart and the judge will let you go.

Extremely dumb.
it was a trend day up ... trend days tend to close with profit taking .. so a trend down will rally and a trend up (today) will dump
Worried Mitch McConnell is the hang up here. I think Trump + all Dem congress > Trump + all repub congress
Because China is using the election as a distraction while they add regulations to businesses like NIO.

You know, sex is great. I love banging out my wife. But porn is pretty great too, because I can‚Äôt tell my wife half the weird shit I‚Äôve beaten off to, and nobody knows my dick like my hand. Sex is a production: the timing has to be right, there‚Äôs a bit of performance, there‚Äôs preparation beforehand and cleanup after. But jerking off to porn is a breeze. I can rub one out in the handicap stall at the office to a video of a dude knocking golf balls into a Eastern European chick‚Äôs gaping anus. I can crank it in the car on the way home while watching Asian fetish models drink spit from a glass. With the right material I can beat my dick to a pulp in 2 minutes flat. That‚Äôs convenience you don‚Äôt get with sex. Sex and porn aren‚Äôt *competitors*. Sex and porn are like two shirtless twinks asking you without judgement if you want a good old fashioned fuck or a quick handjob. Both are good. I like to think this world is big enough for both sex and porn.
None of that will help their terrible actual business prospects.

I personally could give a flying fuck who wins from a politics side because rarely has the government helped the people, BUT Donny helps my bank account sooo thats how I vote
Yes, Fred Jr. was the one who was groomed to take over the empire but he wasnt very interested in it. He wanted to be a pilot and Trump Sr. forbade it.

When Don took over, and even before then, when the business fucked up, it was Freddy's fault.

Dude wound up self medicating with alcohol, drank himself out of his pilots license and then ultimately wound up as the Trump companies maintenance guy.

I mean, logically it makes sense for a quick hitter, but I‚Äôve had no luck on weed stocks looking for a quick buck on legalization. The enthusiasm just hasn‚Äôt been there each time and the number of institutional investors that could move prices can‚Äôt buy it.

That'll do it for our post-game coverage this evening, for more analysis tune into the election discussion thread. From all of us here at WSB Sports, good night!
Guh
The dude looks like Putin
I do get what you are saying as far as monetary policy having a limited effect in getting extra cash into the circulating money supply because the limiting factor is banks being unwilling to lend additional money even if they have the expanded reserves to do so. Expanded reserves don't necessarily lead to a truly expanded money supply. 

The FED however does have direct lending facilities set up right now, and they have bought directly in the corporate debt bond markets; not just through Blackrock.

Markets grew by 10.5% per year under Obama. 9.5% under Trump thus far.

Stocks do just fine regardless of who's in power. We had a steady pattern of growth before the corporate tax cuts.

This weird notion that a Biden victory means we go into a recession is some bullshit. But chances are that's a trough you willingly go to.
Same
Meanwhile it‚Äôs leftists that are burning and looting their cities.
Nobody tell him
I have calls, but I'm hoping for a clown fiesta before next open that causes us to gap down so calls can get real cheap. Then by Thursday we start having an idea of a clear uncontested winner and the rally engages.

Sadly, reality has shown that the stock market has risen significantly under a number of democratic presidents and fallen or not gone up as much under republican presidents. 

You can look it up. 

I was told if trump (being a business man, not a republican establishment politician) became president he would fix the economy and taxes and regulations in such as way that the economy would boom so hard like we'd never seen before.

That did not happen. Even before the corona. That did not happen. 

THERE WAS NO MASSIVE BOOM THE LIKES WE'VE NEVER SEEN.

(Going up a little bit isn't the same thing.)

Well they've certainly got to be thinking about it, because as I mentioned, these breakout performances by VIX were really fueled by teams that weren't accounting for his explosive athletic abilities, you maybe see how much more you can get out of Michael VIX but as a long term solution I don't think you're gonna surprise anyone going forward

Biden can still win without Florida

Biden can still win without Pennsylvania

Biden can still win with late ballots

He's going to concede for fuck's sake. He's just sick of being asked. It's a stupid fucking question by a bunch of idiot trust fund kids who can't tell the difference between a narcissistic game show host and an actual tyrant.

I am no role model man, trust me. Everyone‚Äôs situation is different. For me personally, I am in a position in my life right now where I am young enough to risk everything, and still have time to recover if things went south. If you have no real responsibilities, like take taking care of a family, or anything like that. Then you can afford to be more risk adverse. Just my philosophy, don‚Äôt be afraid to lose it all to gain everything. Otherwise life is boring.

TLDR: stop overthinking buy calls
People keep hyping Texas' record voting numbers saying it's bullish for Biden, when Texas has the largest oil industry by far - arguably bullish for Trump
Sorry, seemed like you were looking for quick hitters.  I get your point though.
Really? markets have been green all day with expectations of a Biden win. As far as presidents go Biden is a really stable and safe pick.

Trump is such a wild card, in 2016 people wanted a change but I don‚Äôt think anyone expected the ride to be that wild.
If Biden is winning Florida, it's over.

I am surprised by the number of people in WSB that think Biden is the right choice. You would think people trying to make money in the market and taking risks would be mostly republican.

Making money is f n hard, keeping it should be your number one priority.  Don't go for this socialism crap.  It never works and you do not want to fund people that are not taking risks to make money.

You should want to keep the volatility. You get bigger swings faster, so it's easier to profit when you're right. You want to go back to days of the market being up or down .30% and your portfolio barely moving?

Yeah Gus take a look at this play right here, UVXY gets a great release on this route and the defense is on the strong side of the field but the ball gets away from VIX here, just throws it over his head out of bounds, and then you see mental lapses from the rest of this offense here on this late holding call that really -- I mean, you just can't afford to be holding here, I don't know what they were thinking on this one.
3380 to 3347 in a couple of mins... no biggie, completely normal market.

Of all the plays out there, I was confident that volatility would go up leading into election day.

For fucks sake, the orange cunt already told that he thinks votes are fake news and that he won't concede.

Either this is a blue wave priced in or MMs just completely rat fucked the VIX.
Maybe a good short-term play, but in my experience investors haven‚Äôt been enthused by weed stocks after the bubble popped.
Tonight‚Äôs about to be wild. No one thinks we‚Äôll get the results tonight so naturally we probably will know by midnight who won.

Can‚Äôt wait for Netflix to capitalize on a shit show if it goes down that way. Smh... I‚Äôll probably watch it too.
It makes so much sense that market will moon if trump wins or biden wins. Therefore i bought puts
Really could use one of Chimpus updates rn. I bet he would know what to do in these uncertain times

Fuck that! Did I say Donald Trump? While Donnie is a good showman, he's a shit ass president. We're fucked if we have four more years of that bullshit.
I got a lot of puts

I‚Äôm with you. I sold my options today. I have some shares to so I‚Äôll let that ride but yeah there‚Äôs a lot of pump. I can see it sky rocket tomorrow morning only because of the volume from today but that rug might free fall for a bit. Who knows tho. This market can raw dog you longer than you can remain crying.
Nevermind, some big fucking put orders ($5.1M) came in AH.

Did you close because of BABA's fiasco lol
So this is what I did.. bought the $37 call back cause it was -20% and sold the $38 call paying the small difference in premium (debit). I want nio to run but this euphoria is not sustainable. If it drops tomorrow which I‚Äôm guessing it will, I‚Äôll buy back the $38 call again and hopefully cover what I paid in premium today. I‚Äôm already up 120% on the long leg ($30 strike) so yes, in the green üòÄ

I have AAL and travel stocks who should I be rooting for
About 50% bearish comments as well: https://stocks.comment.ai/

But we all know tomorrow is green, Softbank bought calls for the election. Enough to move the market.
Or they are trying to get cozy with Biden.
Tech will probably face more uncertainty if biden wins, there is incentive for him to crack down on certain companies(FB, Twitter) that he feels aided trump.
Bold
I think I can safely say, futures don‚Äôt matter tonight
üòÇüòÇ. Imagine how deep market will go if it become a contested election. It seems both of them are ready for it. The only difference is Donnie is screaming about it.

Nah, he's just literally that bad at being president. That even as the incumbent, he's still somehow the underdog.

Okay so. I‚Äôve made like a grand and trippled my
RH account from your call. I‚Äôm freaking out. >.<
So that'll do it for this one and Todd are you surprised by the performance from Michael VIX today?

Oh absolutely, VIX had a huge opportunity here, after a breakout performance last week there was so much hype for Michael VIX and the stage was set, but he was completely shut down by Jerome Powell and this defense. Seems to me it's one of those situations where now the coaches around the league have updated film on the guy and he hasn't been able to adjust to the strategies they've used to counter him.
Doesn't matter if Biden or Trump wins. It matters who gets the Senate.
Goldman Sachs promotes it as well. 

They may be right in a weakening dollar raises prices for stocks - along with everything else
6 mins into AH...
Called the pump this past few days in a comment last week and the flat level for today I called this morning. Let‚Äôs see if the third part comes true: big pullback by friday no matter who wins.

Atta boy!
well fuck id like to get some spy options, just dont know which way
The Fed does buy Agency MBS directly from the secondary market. 

The Fed also does literally buy bonds from commercial dealer banks when the purpose of buying those bonds is to fund the federal government (in these cases the dealers are buying at auction and quickly flipping the bonds). The $1,200 checks we got were new money printed by the fed; not just money generated from leveraged bank reserves. 

The Fed also accepts treasury bonds as collateral in repo which expand bank reserves - I believe this is the activity you are referring to

But at some point the FED does have to be buying treasuries or at least giving incentive to dealer banks to buy them (expanding reserve requirements and accepting treasuries as collateral for cash), otherwise they would be unable to achieve their targets as far as lowering interest rates goes.
Not this time.  Biden needs to win by a landslide within the first week (maybe today) to clinch a victory.   He doesn't have alternative paths to victory, aside from fighting Trump's other paths in court and hope he wins.  

But yes, you're right that technically Trumps paths to victory existed with other elections, but this time we have something we didn't have which is 1. the pieces are all in place at the same time and 2. an incumbent who is willing to actually use them.  

Anyway, I don't personally think it's going to shake out like that.  If Trump loses, despite all his boasting and the hand-wringing of his campaign about how they'll fight to the bitter end, I bet he'll just concede and be glad the whole thing is over.  

But the dude who bet $5MM obviously disagrees with me.
I was going to get puts but then I realized they'll be a whole lot cheaper tomorrow at open when it's flat and the IV plummets
Bought a put at 3:40, watched it drop 30%, held and sold for a 6% loss at 3:59
I'm stacked to the tits in vxx calls. Let's see how this shakes out. There's no way of knowing anything anymore
Notebook out, what's your next big play?

Apparently in some small township in NH they already started counting the votes and Biden got all 5 votes. That's it folks, the results are in.
200% gain last week, 50% hit today.... this may be it but its been a hell of a ride!
It‚Äôs all just a simulation
I think NIU is the better NIO 2.0 bet than XPEV. Both good plays along with LI though.
MM‚Äôs really had to fuck me all day, they only used lube in the last 5 minutes of trading
This only happens every 4 years boys!!! Enjoy it. Whether we win or lose FUCK IT ITS JUST MONEY ALL IN ON NIO BTW

You can wait or just close then whole position, what's your breakeven on the $37 and what's your long leg strike? I wouldn't be that worried you're gonna make money either way.

Got me for sure. I ended up going into the night with spreads in both directions that are already at a loss.
In 2008 S&P500 was down -14.84% in 10 days after the election results.
We are currently in the same situation. Expect a big dump after the results.

That was a sell off? Looked like someone at MCD giving change on a $1 menu McGriddle.
Intel you piece of shit
last election the market dropped ‚âà 5 % during election night and the quickly recovered. now with this volatility I have no idea whats going to happen but it would be extremely funny if the market would just trade some kind of a confusing range to fuck just about everybody.
biden clearly won, the market says so
Glad I got 11/11 338 puts at the high today üòàüòà

Jeez that was some insane selling going on the last two minutes. WOW!
What a bull trap that was.
Buckle up
This aged very well very quickly. Nice job jinxing it retard
It can still be sold since there are computers that will take it from you for the right price. You can always get it's "intrinsic value," which is the amount of profit you'd get if you exercised it and sold the shares this instant.
after hrs is not lol
Damn that close was truly wild
That part where they pumped everything at 3PM only to fucking dump it at 350 was not particularly cash money
YESSSS SSIRRRRR
Bagholding BABA December way OTM and November ATM calls. Let‚Äôs see how earnings goes after they‚Äôve already been beaten down to a new low. If ANT IPO V2 gets announced in the next few weeks it will moon.
Wehhh pussy
Had us in the first 6 hrs and 25 minutes, not gonna lie
So lets see...

* Fauci & other experts said it would not go away on its own, Trump said it would.
* Fauci & other experts said we would see another spike/wave in the fall which we currently are, Trump said we're rounding the curve out of it.
* Fauci & other experts said not to expect a vaccine until 2021 at the earliest, Trump said we'd have it "momentarily" and before the election.

Looks like expertise does know what the fuck its talking about, generally. Trump and his base's response to this information is... *fire Fauci*.

And what does the future hold?

* Fauci & other experts say we will experience a brutal, dark winter with COVID, Trump says we won't.

Vote the dangerous idiot out.
So GME is not just a meme?
Holding 329p down $350. Fuckkk
I‚Äôve been gaining 300-500$ every day since the 29th. And I only have 2,400$ in my rh acct. It went from 500 down to 1.4k up. Is this real?
I bought 20k worth of calls seeing all this green today :/
Me and you both brother
Jesus spins the wheel. What a pleb
ü§°ü§°ü§°
Trump wins a narrow EC. Dems take the senate and hold the house. Trump resigns January 19th and is pardoned by Pence. We then proceed with no VP for 4 years. Wish Bovada would cap this cuz I‚Äôd throw $100 on it at +4000 or better.
Either last week was the greatest bear trap of all time or today was the greatest bull trap of all time.
You liked that dump into the close. Kind of obvious that would happen. Easy money.
Well how about that
Yessir
Holy fuck.

I still think there will be a Trump win.
Loaded to the tits with puts. Godspeed
You bought spy puts too?
Did 340/350 debit spreads on spy on that dip for next Friday. See what happens

Touche.  My thinking as well
SPY DEAD
That close was so bullish.
Damn that EOD selloff
[deleted]
I can see this happening.

Let me paint the scenario for you:

It's Friday, and the votes are in. Chump, whom you voted for, has lost. There's a lot of talk about how the libtards rigged the election and memes all over FB showing how Burisma participated in a huge disinformation campaign against your buddy Chump, but that's just gotten you fired up.

You need to do something, you need to relieve some stress, you need to fucking scream.

It's a party then. DM's fire off to Alex, Chet, Brandon and Mary. You're getting together at Gerald's at 10, bring everyone, bring all the bottles, bring anything.

The white pickups with peeling tint congregate in numbers like your county hasn't seen in years, not since Judy's graduation smash in '15. People are parked on the other side of the neighbors, and Gerald's dad has 51 acres of fallow corn fields that he wrote off as a loss for tax rebates after harvesting for deer feed.

Impressive.

It's wild, party is off the chain and nobody can hear what anybody is saying. Becca showed up, so you naturally start grinding on her to the caterwauling of Luke Combs' "Lovin' on You." On the other side of the room is an orangutan someone kidnapped from the zoo during some protests in the city because shit wasn't locked up so why not? He's wearing a MAGA hat and seems to be getting himself quite inebriated. Everyone has decided that he's their personification of Chump and keeps walking by and smacking him on the back mid-swig.

Well it seems that orangutans aren't fond of choking on carbonated beverages, and Becca just happens to be "in season", as your jocular and definitely not hyper-masculine and never sexist pals on the varsity team would quip. OraungoDonnie can't get a fix on who is slapping him on the back. He spins one way and sees idiots gesticulating wildly, and he swings the other and sees a bunch of screaming kids around a beer pong table.

He zeroes in on you because he understands how to compete for a mate, and he can smell Becca from across the room. He knows how to handle this situation and he's ready for some blood.

The bellow goes out, you've been challenged and the room goes silent except for the blaring speakers. Next sound is the coffee table being flipped and OranguDonnie is charging. Instincts kick in and you're running after shoving Becca on top of her friends on the couch. There's a quick  loop through the kitchen, when you come back out you find everyone staring, but when OranguDonnie comes out everyone fucking books it.

Shit just got weird.

Forgetting the floor plan of Gerald's you accidentally end up in the laundry room. There's a tense few seconds of OranguDonnie trying to beat down the door and you realize it isn't going to hold, so you grab the ironing board off the wall, let it swing and lay the board on top of OranguDonnie to use as a plank, sliding your way to an escape.

The doors are packed with screaming rednecks when you come back into the living room and OranguDonnie didn't lose any time, he's just behind you. Upstairs is the only option. You take them 3 at a time and just manage to avoid tripping to find the hallway with doors of which you only know where one leads and it has no windows. Your smooth brain calculates the law of averages before you have time to and you instinctively head for the opposite door.

But not before OranguDonnie snakes out one of those creepily long orange arms and grabs your ankle in a death-grip. You go face first in the carpet and next thing you know he's crawling on top of you.

This is when you squealed. You know what type of squeal.

Nobody heard it, you think. Except OranguDonnie, he knows what that squeal means and he raises his hands high to give you a double open-handed ground pound that'd likely have put you out for the weekend if you hadn't somehow managed to worm - literally, do The Worm - and wiggle out from underneath him. He changes tactics to grab you again but only gets your pants, and they come off with minimal effort.

You're off to the door. You're through the door. The piss-flap on your boxers catches on the knob and they give way as you careen into the wall, knock over a chair and fall on the bed.

Into my room that I was renting from Gerald's dad after losing my ass on WSB and having to give up my bachelor pad in the 'burbs. I had been fucking around on my phone for 3 hours trying to pretend there wasn't about to be an orgy downstairs while flipping through Tinder only to find that everything under 40 in possession of a vagina was already at the party because there aren't exactly a lot of options on the ass-end of society and I was probably going to have to swallow a handful of xannies to get to sleep sometime this weekend.

And you land right the fuck on top of me, micropenis shriveled even further from the adrenaline rush of your life being in danger and heading in the wrong direction your balls end up smacking my chin before I get kicked in the head as you scramble for the window. OranguDonnie has "A moment" with the door which he doesn't appreciate just swinging any which way it pleases and that affords you the gap you need to get the window open and roll out on the shingle roof, then slide down to freedom.

Giving yourself some absolutely brutal road-rash, the scabs of which will be peeling for months.

I think the mods all live in Portland. One mention of Portland and you‚Äôre getting sent to the shadow realm just to come back with a barcode next to your name.
 I assume you‚Äôre playing a Biden win for legalizing mj, it‚Äôs a growing industry, yeah, but I think it has a while to go. Mainly bc i don‚Äôt think its a priority rn, like how he was talking about environmental change/plan coming in March (with stimmy deal). It‚Äôs good that u traded the rumor, but no one was interested in it rn.
You'd think it would've consolidated through election, but it's been running since last week.. few big players got in recently and with good numbers I think retail is finally catching up.
lmao true
NGL pretty excited for futes
just some calm profit taking just in case, no worries
this sentiment conflicts with my financial prospects .... FAKE NEWS
You would have been better off throwing your money into a toilet.
What‚Äôs your reasoning here? I thought IV crush is solely related to investor relation findings, such as earnings and press releases
Perfectly timed puts purchase in the last 10 mins.  betting against America for a hopeful $500. here we gooo!
It means no one is trading that option today.
I use Bovada for my sports degeneracy. It‚Äôs a decent enough book.
>eh, pc culture is lame 

I don't think you got downvoted for calling him a retard, it was just because the rest of your comment was dumb.
Wow this is too complicated
I've been watching UPWK, as a freelancer on their platform. Not convinced this is going to happen.
I won't go down like this.

Two days in a row ending in massive volume selling. Fed liquidity PPT is real.
Im a canuck so i get to just watch from up here, with no moral responsibility
This election has me posting and buying November 16 calls for 355 lol
Those who bought anything less than 330 probably but it‚Äôs a lot more realistic this will go down short term than shoot up to 350 like most people are claiming lol
But RKT is not the type of tech company as BILL, DDOG and JFROG
My biggest issue with the "democrat" party is that democracy selected Bernie not once but twice. And both times he got robbed. Anyone who supported Bernie or who truly believes in "by the people" should be outraged.

# PUTS AREN'T GOING TO BE ANY CHEAPER FOLKS!
The market sold off too much over the past week and it was mostly retail.  Retail accounts increased in cash and institutional accounts decreased in cash.  Money has been coming back into the market and today we had such a huge run that people started taking profit in the middle of the day. Now at the end of the day you have people covering shorts and/or getting long.  

The key here is where do we end up at the end of the year.  It looks like 350+ on the SPY.
Here comes the drop

Sorry, what????? I can‚Äôt understand your comment because of all the weird abbreviations and capitalizations. My girlfriend(which you probably don‚Äôt haveüòÇ) would never be interested in someone who does not have the basic intellect needed to put together a sentence. Guess which button I pressed on your comment. (hint: it wasn‚Äôt the upvote buttonüòÇ) (hint: it was the downvote buttonüòÇ)(since you‚Äôre probably too dumb to figure it out yourselfüòÇ)
First down, VIX takes the snap, no pressure this time they're in zone coverage, VIX steps up and throws one up looking for SPY and he's GOT IT across midfield but he's inbounds! Clock still running and they need to get on the ball! Michael VIX is hurrying everybody back to the line of scrimmage and he clocks the ball
Meanwhile here in CA the card rooms and tribal casinos would rather not let it ever happen than see the other side share in success. Good thing Reno is only a 3.5 hour drive üò≠

Under two minutes to play, Michael VIX leads the offense back on to the field, no timeouts trying to make something happens. THey'll need several miracles here. VIX takes the snap, three man rush and VIX takes off, 25, 30, and runs out of bounds just shy of the 35

These guys getting real good at taking my money
If florida goes biden Trump has no route to victory. So basically we could see the effective decision pretty early
I think we are pricing in a contested election. Something about today's run feels like a bull trap. I'm holding mostly cash, a few stocks, and some VIXY calls. We'll see...
Found 2020‚Äôs anti-motto.
Cute, but that makes you just as gay then.

Bears are extinct after today
Yes please. Selling short term cc‚Äôs today to you degenerates.
Yes duh

Edit: actually I may be wrong. The market is probably factoring in a slim (maybe 20%) chance the election is decided tonight (Biden). Assuming that isn‚Äôt the case IV may actually go up (I‚Äôm retarded and inexperienced) tomorrow due to the fact that the election is going to be a contested lengthy event.

Edit 2: sorry for the ‚Äúyes duh‚Äù I‚Äôm drunk
No way it doesn‚Äôt pump if Biden is ahead all night.  Stimulus news is bigger than anything right now

Yeah, but I'm buying shares with a trailing stop order. Not calls. Those are probably getting fucked.
I think vix is relatively unaffected tomorrow. maybe even slightly up.

Let me out. Let me out!
the drop is cancelled dude. It's over. Priced in as fuck.  

Only up from here.
every time you sell a straddle, iron condor, strangle, or any strategy that involves selling volatility (convexity) back into the market your exposure is significantly larger than the actual profit you make. This is for every single small investor, large institutional investor, and Hedge Funds. This is the inherent LEFT TAIL RISK due to exposure and small profits in ANY AND ALL SHORT VOL strategies - The difference between all other strategies you've seen posted is I include your exposure risk and profit. Hence why they say you're "picking up pennies in front of a steam truck" - The amount of profit in terms of overall exposure is very small. Although - if you were to annualise the profit potential on this trade its is off the map despite the inherent left tail risk etc
Why not both?

I have a feeling this thread will end well with no hurt feeling and be the most civil discourse ever witnessed in WSB history.
Well, Michael VIX had the perfect setup here, he had a man open and made a throw to the spot but this is just a brilliant play by Jerome Powell to see the play developing and jump the route, and then look at this sidestep as he evades a tackle from UVXY, just an incredible effort
I always manage to have puts in the biggest rallies of the year. Each time this year, and calls on the bloody days. It‚Äôs amazing.

lmao this comment just made my day
chinese regulators checking out Ant's balance sheet
You are wrong.  The fed doesn't print money to buy bonds, it goes to the commercial banks and buys bonds from them in exchange for reserves.  Banks are not allowed to withdraw or touch their reserves, they can only use the reserves as collateral for loans.  New money is not introduced, rather people leverage themselves with debt and through the fractional reserve banking system that money is amplified--this is where inflation comes from.
What stupid inspirational bullshit. Rich people do all of those things on the left

True, but they also just took a huge drop today. I don‚Äôt see it going any lower unless they completely miss earnings. Anything under $285 is getting bought up immediately

So you breakeven at 407..hmm..if you hold i think you could potentially sell for 4000 but could be worth 1000 on Friday. That's a tough one! If it is a significant portion of your portfolio then you should sell. If it isn't a huge position for you let it ride.
investment banks are buying in right now for a bigly green week
I agree on Florida. Texas isn't vital, as its not super likely to flip. Penn said it'll take until end of week.

Do you jerk off?
Believe it or not, ban.
I do not understand why anyone thinks Biden winning is any better or worse than Trump winning. Just because you feel one way about a candidate doesn't mean the whole world or the market feels the same. Even if everyone on your social media agrees with you.

Unpopular opinion: NIO is a hype, and everyone‚Äôs taking out their frustrations/FOMO for the Tesla bull run last year. Nobody knows why everyone‚Äôs buying NIO, just the price is increasing but nobody thinks that the price is increasing so abnormally only because retards are spending their life savings on a stock whose products they haven‚Äôt even used.

I put a decent sized bet on Kanye to get 0-199,000 votes. If I'm wrong, probably going to move to Canada because I live amongst retards.
Have you read the comments around here?  People were expecting a drop like March to happen starting today.  I will say though, I for one was not expecting us to just pump like we did today.  I had TSLA calls yesterday and I decided to turn them into bear call spreads to because I figured we'd stay flat, and yah - they're in the money now and I'm getting ass raped.

This makes no sense. People let the market tank for a week and then the day of the election decide, "actually, I think Biden will win even though the polling/percentages have been the same for literally 6 months."
No way we should be this green today. I‚Äôm buying spy puts for tomorrow
Upvote for Biden
Lol you make 400k.  Alright buddy üëçüèª
TRUMP SOUNDS DEFEATED AHHHH FUCK!
So what's your point. I'm not trying to push politics.

Sure the market may not show greater returns from "sell off before taxes", but that doesn't account for the other economic measures, which make up the fundamentals of the market in the first place. 

What you're saying basically boils down to "prices change, but value doesn't"

So if a blue sweep gives us a pullback, buy the fuckin dip.

Wait at least until mid day tomorrow. Then, do not touch the options. Buy shares in waves. 

People here don't know of refuse to care to know that options are essentially buying the first and second derivatives of the stock price function. In a volatile time like this, the second derivative doesn't converge to anything, so you have no idea where the price will go.
Volatility my ass
It‚Äôs pretty true. I have a BS in Economics and an MA in applied economics and an MQM (Masters in Quantitative Management) as well. And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it‚Äôs a dumb question and they don‚Äôt even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. 

Unless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. 

I can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it‚Äôs irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. 

But I just point people towards index‚Äôs, tell them if they aren‚Äôt retiring in the next 5 years don‚Äôt be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. 

tl;dr Economists don‚Äôt study the economy they study scarcity. I‚Äôd be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren‚Äôt adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we‚Äôre in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.

BABA calls or puts?

I don't like people who buy puts
these threads used to get 20k comments by 11am
Okay, so I was a manager at AMC before the pandemic began. This company is too mismanaged to stay in business.

First of all, most of the theaters are falling apart (I'm talking about the previously owned by Carmike theaters.) They are filled with mold, old/broken equipment, etc. Before the pandemic, they already couldn't afford the necessary repairs.

Individual theaters waste way too much money when it comes to inventory. That's mostly because they've chosen bad food products to sell (i.e. stuff that goes bad quickly or things no one wants.) They also do not have enough control over spending when it comes to cleaning supplies; theaters waste thousands of dollars on unnecessary supplies, and their theaters are still disgusting. Also, the teenagers who work there are super wasteful and honestly steal a ridiculous amount of food. Oh, and projector light bulbs are $1,000+ each.

And an important point, AMC made that really bad deal with universal to only have movies play for a few weeks before it can be moved to streaming or something. That's ridiculous and is terrible news for AMC. Mostly because studios have it set to where if they have a movie playing at your theater, you HAVE to play it once every set. So if there's a movie that's been out for 2 months, you have to play it alongside the new movies. So say, in the future, a big movie comes out, but there's only 1 blockbuster and 5 older indie films. AMC can't JUST play the blockbuster-- they have to reserve other screens for the other movies. They can only give the other screens to the blockbuster at the last minute IF no one buys tickets to the indie film. But if the movies are being moved to streaming services, no one is going to opt to see the indie movie when they find out the blockbuster is sold out. Not to mention the limited seating to allow for social distancing.

The thing is, AMC was already broke before the pandemic.. The business model just doesn't apply as well as it used to. If they survive, they'll definitely have to close all the older locations. I have looked at 2020 as the "nail in the coffin" for AMC. They had a good 100 years of business..
They bought ITM puts?
FUCK IT ALL IN BA 170

No, but you might get a candidate declaring victory despite that

380 EOY
ur just missin he train silly
Calm before the storm...
These two elections are nothing alike. Undecideds are far smaller, and the margin of error for polling would have to be off ***even more*** than it was for 2016.
Feel like election results are priced in UNTIL Trump starts tweeting BS and getting people riled up
so how do you gamble on the election with the stock market?
If you don't vote for Trump it's a vote for Biden

If you don't vote for Biden it's a vote for Trump

If you vote for Howie you're a mega tard

There's other people on the ballot but they're NPCs

And if you stay home, you've voted twice and that's illegal
Hay look at this smaht guy
Biden increasingly the favorite on Bovada..RIP my taxes
Bout to put my fist through a fucking wall.

FUCK VXX
SPY calls expiring early 2021 a good idea?
I'm down
You¬¥ve missed 350 EOD tomorrow, but I¬¥ve got your back.
it's exponentially more complicated than just stealing checks. you'd have to steal all the votes, open all the envelopes including the inner ones that are signed by the voter, throw away the ones from the candidate you don't like, reseal the votes for the candidate you do like in new envelopes that have a plausible signature that matches the real signature (because they do compare them with software) then reseal them in new legit outer envelopes that match the ones from the board of elections, and then mail them all again without being noticed
Typically when a meme stock gets hyped here,  it dies after couple of days,  so Buy puts Thursday on Nio.  It happens every fukkin time

Win or lose, you‚Äôre a scumbag. Don‚Äôt kick a man when he‚Äôs down
not a chance
You didn't mention the short call portion of that position.
My biggest regret was being more cautious and not being more on dip because of sentiment here other wise would bought EMR and LOW as well damn.
You‚Äôre retarded if you think it‚Äôs gonna be a landslide. 

It‚Äôs gonna be contested and we‚Äôre gonna have a civil war.
Hey I didn‚Äôt even do options for these gains. Just smart investing. Did the research bro
üòÇ
Now switch back to puts!
There, I bought 1 SPY 340 call expiring tomorrow to hedge my massive puts. Investing 101

You mean the soup kitchen train? Get this baby shit outta here.
Same. Inversed myself and bought calls on Friday, sold at a fat gain today and bought puts. Come on, chaos!
grad school but not finance. slowly but surely paid every last penny. then I see some 20 yr old thots who buy a house cash with onlyfans money and realize I wasted my life.
Yeah why is there a major event today?
bull trap sprung! SINK YOU FUCKER!
Selling short positions against everything I have, banking on all the glorious IV crush
UTZ CALLS
Bears always rooting for the complete collapse of society so they can make a 100 bucks off their spy puts smh.
Holding my spy 280p 11/20s... This is going to be an epic bull trap.
Will we get election results tonight?
Anyone buying calls into end of the day?
Especially annoying ones
Implied volatility means that there is a higher chance the call is in/out of the money therefore there is more risk which increases the premium. Your breakeven is still the same but you‚Äôd make money selling them today
how long is TSLA going\*\*\*
Tomorrow gunna be fugly

Robinhood makes up the value of contracts by finding the middle between the bid and ask price, so it isn't always accurate.

What position are you in so we can all laugh at you? What strike price?

Also: if you wait until the end it is only worth the difference between the strike and the actual trading price. All the delicious EV is gone and you are left with the stale IV. Sell it before it gets there unless you think the stock is gonna moon and you will make even more

No such thing
I got January calls for the low low
until 4:15 yes
Question - if Biden wins and dems take Senate, they won't actually hold office until Jan. Why would Trump and Repub senate go along with a stimulus bill in that case? Wouldn't they just sit on their hands until Jan so they can claim some sort of "fiscal conservatism" that they always revert to when they are in the opposition?

No reason for a huge pullback honestly.

They've got multiple events lined up, and theyre chilling around where analysts have their targets

Probably a small pullback and some consolidation due to everyone buying in, early investors may want to lock profits in.
NIO at 35 still seems like a good buy to me... maybe I‚Äôll drop a grand in. I want to wait for a dip, but it‚Äôs climbing each day

Drinking is beginning a bit early today gentlemen, breaking out the imperial stouts for tonight‚Äôs election fuckery.
Yes that is what happened in 2000, but also 1800, 1824, and in 1877 when Congress ended up determining the winner.  If that same thing happened now, Trump would win (because despite Dems controlling votes, the Republicans have state delegation majority).  So there is a clear strategy to contest the election results in one or more state, have SCOTUS kick the decision to Congress, and win it there.  Alternatively, if Biden wins in swing states with GOP-controlled state legislatures, they can simply replace those electors with Trump ones.  


That's probably what the dude is betting on.  If he wins, he wins.  If he loses, he still has a couple more paths to victory.
HYLN ER is 11/12...I mean it can't be worse than booking solar panel installation revenues, probably worth a flier eh?

What is this? An IPO for ANTs?
tomorrow
Apple puts -70% lol
Break even price - from my understanding - is meant on expiration day. If the contract doesn‚Äôt hit that price by expiration day then you lost money on the contract even if it is in the money. Example, say you have a $10c and paid $1 for it, then if the stock value doesn‚Äôt hit $11 or over it on expiration day then you lost money on the trade even if you do exercise the contract. This goes the same way for selling contracts.
Just trying to lighten the mood.
Is their primary income fees or mortgage spreads?
That is talking about break even price at expiry.
If Trump wins we are gonna hit 360 by EOD tomorrow.
it's a tank. wish I just put everything in carrier 3 months ago
Mods are so fuckin gay it‚Äôs insane really
This made me laugh

PLTR got major legs, people on Wall Street are buying it life fucking fire. Just hasn't had institutional hop because of the lack of guidance and earnings report. The people at those institutions are buying it like fucking crazy though.

Dumb question here. If you look at the break even price, it's $26.95, but the options are clearly making money today What am I not understanding correctly? If I theoretically sold these today, would I actually be losing money since it's not at the break even? Doesn't appear that way?

Nah that‚Äôs just propaganda. Blue states aren‚Äôt the ones who need bailing out. New York and California contribute more to GDP than all red states combined. And the bad outbreaks are in red states now. Don‚Äôt buy that BS. The entire southeast is bankrupt (all red states) and bailed out by blue states. This has been the case for decades.

Well Gus, you saw it right there, Michael VIX absolutely threaded the needle on that throw and would have set his team up, but what a costly mistake to commit holding right now in this situation, you know he's gonna get chewed out on the bench for that one. Just a crucial mental mistake right there.

3M and 6M charts for SPY and NDX look pretty bearish honesty. Especially the 3M one, easy to see a falling wedge and we don't really have a catalyst to break that pattern yet.

BABA is too big for it to amount to anything in the long run IMO, seems like a prime chance for a long-term buy once the bottom is found.
I had 50 15 jan21 calls o bought for .80 cents each when it was 7 bucks in july... Sold for a loss when it dipped to 6 bucks... Coulda made 5k into 100k

I‚Äôm not retarded or anything, I know it‚Äôs bc of the election betting but it‚Äôs crazy how high premiums are this week compared to next week
The fact that there's an algo out there that looks at the headline "Comcast and Walmart making a smart TV" and immediately calculates "This is bad for ROKU" and dump it faster than the human eye and brain can process the same headline is fucking terrifying.

I believe the real cost of those cars was around $800-$1,000 which would make the price comparible. 

Those cars were very simple. No air conditioning, no seatbelts, no safety\crash requirements\airbags\seatbelts, no stereo, no automatic transmission
And it‚Äôll continue to do that til next week
Good shit homie

3rd and 6 now, VIX takes the snap and looks to his left, now back to his right and lets it go over the middle and IT'S CAUGHT FOR A FIRST DOWN!!! Tremendous read by Michael VIX but there's a flag on the play and I think this one's coming back.

Yep, that's a 10 yard holding penalty, I didn't see who was holding at this stage of the game but they must be pretty retarded. That sets up a 3rd and long for Michael VIX and this offense

Ppl do this, i do it all the time. Occasionally though it can go bad and when it does it goes realllly bad.

Market pricing in Biden u tard
Classic insult by someone who doesn‚Äôt know either lol
[deleted]
which means it will be flat
0 chance
333 was strong resistance yesterday
Market isn‚Äôt pricing in anything today, it‚Äôs doing what it does best in moments like this, playing fuckary.
I'll follow up with the subreddit.  Good look.
Well obviously it won't keep climbing forever but I think it'll at least hit $40 before January.
I concur.
Slow on their payments to the local party heads, now they are gonna have to give the govt more of the company, install the requisite backdoors etc
CYH Calls
We pump pump pumping and we gunna continue to pump til Friday
Maybe use your buying power and buy more options you virgin

Not happening
Arent those the equivalent of you getting an email about a somalian prince getting an inheritance and wanting your bank account info to send you 10 million?
I know about IV (different guy now btw), but how much will it affect the price of my puts? Obviously there will be IV crush but I have January 2021 SPY puts, strike is 300. Will these be down 25% tomorrow just with IV?
I guess nobody told automod about the time change
Gonna celebrate being down only 50% today with a nice Asian lady (:
It means the market's going to stage a fast recovery post-election; or volatility is going to skyrocket.
Why the voice of reason in the bear fantasy ?
Switched to calls. Got some VXX for tomorrow maybe. It's obvious the market wants to rocket after this is over.
BABA getting investigated..
I'm on food stamps and working on my mixtape.

Fuck off with your political opinion
nothing, there is no reason to enter a bunch of trades EOD.  Wait until open.
The Republicans dont wanna pass it right now because they dont want to bail out blue states but I think that is only because the election was coming up, they know a bailout is needed so they will pass one after the election when a compromise is reached with the Dems
Spy 336/334 put debit spread expiring tomorrow just go all in and double your money EZ
[deleted]
Where you got this stats
Odds ratios are a horrible representation. It kinda works when you assume some info: 37/20 meaning roughly 2/1, so a win for Trump gets a weight of 2/3. Hence the payout of 15 million includes the original 5 million the banker paid for the bet. A profit of 10 million remains.

Disclaimer: odds ratios are confusing af and I don't understand why anybody uses them in a serious context. For humanity's sake just use probabilities and returns.

It is because it is the EOM options before Thanksgiving rather than weeklies.  Same with 18 Dec 20, 15 Jan 21 in terms of open interest.  Its all open strangles/straddles it seems because they consolidate at the 1,2,3 standard deviation moves etc.  Or are you talking about the skew?

Imagine not having both.
Sell. All the positive news about stock repurchase and support for Dorsey helped the stock today. Check your risk appetite, if you don‚Äôt wanna mess with these gains take the profit.

The Chinese never stops pumping. It's written in their 5 year plan.
It's pretty therapeutic and if you have someone to clean up for you or cook with you it makes it super quick. Plus you can make some really good shit and season it to your liking. I make some super dank Halal chicken and rice with red and white sauce that's better than most halal places in my city and my Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken and Chicken Vindaloo is better than anything I've tried at an Indian restaurant. Plus girls find it sexy as fuck if you can cook

If Merrill's numbers are correct, SPY's volume today with an hour to go isn't even half that of Wednesday and Friday sell off volumes
I mean it‚Äôs California so they probably will? Also, they are probably gonna have terrible earnings. That may be priced in already though.

If there was a way to make enough money every day in the market and be able to take money out of the market so you can pay your bills all while not hurting your total return.... Nobody would go to work :)

This is why you need to convince others to manage their money and give them a return. You can juice them 1% on the size of their portfolio which pays for you to sit at home and trade.
For the long term, yes

I can't see everything, but it's probably the bid-ask spread. If few people are trading that option and the price changes significantly it might note change the market price of that option until more bids are placed. Just remember that with an option that's in the money, it's worth the amount of profit it's already gained that very second and then some (because it also could gain more value later).

Positions: SPY 310 puts 1dte, NIO 23 puts because I think this sub is hyping the stock too much, and don't worry - I am frequently wrong about the stonk monket. Good luck everybody, and God help us all.
Yes

wow what a red dildo
classic
Spy calls and puts 2% out 1dte, you‚Äôre welcome
I would go long into solar and green energy but that‚Äôs just me
Good point, I didnt consider that. I guess my 401k account will be grateful for that. I hope market overreact and tanks though (with a quick recovery of course).
Feeling big green dick energy on GME
Not a leap and high iv decay
Nio napkin math 
So nio doubles deliveries to  5k deliveries a month 
So let‚Äôs say they are on track to deliver 80k in the next year. Let‚Äôs say each car averages 50k. That equates to 4bln in revenue. So they are trading right now @ 9x revenue
Nio literally only goes up
So I‚Äôm balls deep in SQQQ and this fake ass support is pissing me off. Stop fucking around and sell off like we all know it will.

Finally-FUCK keep going
so puts?
They still expire 1/15/21?
Real talk, no politics. Did anything get done in regards to the China Trade war?
Sour hour commence
Outlook good
Question: Anyone got an insight, anecdotal or other, on how suburban Beckies are voting? You know, the kind that likes to vote for RINOs and went for Trump last time as lesser of two evils.
All in ACB weeklies. Let‚Äôs get this short squeeze started.
No one‚Äôs losing money on NIO unless they are betting against it bruh
Lol EtFs
Ok Drake
Bullish close or üêª close?
I remember when these shares were a dollar. Turns out that would have been a good time to load up
I may miss out on some gains but the amount of people saying nio 11/6 calls made makes me content with my 30% gains on getting out of those today

Check back tomorrow if I still feel the same lol
Unless you are shooting Teslas into space you don‚Äôt have fuck you money.
If you just opened your account I assume you don't have options enabled or have any significant settled funds in it. You've probably already missed it. 

We all pretty much have taken positions and just waiting to see big red or big green.

I got SPY Nov 20 '20 $350 CallÔøºs which, by some miracle, might actually make me money or at least break even. I also got SPY $315 put for December 31st.

I also have plenty of toilet paper this time.

He looks pretty alpha to me. Like he could steal your wife and you won't be able to do anything about it because.... you're not the richest most powerful man in the world.

Deal with? R u fucking assless? We thrive with this
Aka a victory for Biden Big Lol.
Man 4chan is still around
You biracial?
If it blood green, Vix is dead.
I actually agree with that. If trump wins we continue the bear run, if Biden wins we get fucked by a corporate tax increase. Scary time
Wow. WTF is up with that?

March 19 also has pretty good volume.

Do you put your 25k in one trade at a time ?
lmao good one

Leidos rebound is just beginning.
I've got $3300 that was earmarked for ANT waiting in my fidelity account, BABA is a good call IMO.
Every situation and market is going to be different, so you'll have to play around with it to see if it makes sense for you and your risk profile.

Generally hedging with puts from the get-go is really expensive and a pretty serious drag on your portfolio and oftentimes not worth it, and the kind of stocks that you'd want to hedge on (read: high-volatility WSB-approved yolo stocks) are even *more* expensive to hedge, so it really has to be a moon-shot for you to come out on top.

In this particular case the OP was in a unique position where he had already taken on all the front-load risk and won big, so now hes far enough away from his original price where he has an opportunity to "let it ride" and hedge at his entry price for basically free.

What if there is no official result because several states are "in dispute"?  The argument won't be "I lost but I get to stay", the argument will be "this election was broken and the results are ultimately inconclusive".  

It's like if you're playing games with a guy and he starts complaining that his controller is broken.  He's not going for a win, he's going for a "this round doesn't count".
He‚Äôs way less verbally anti China than trump for starters but even his policy doesn‚Äôt target it as much. Remember in the second debate when they were asked the biggest foreign threat? Trump said China Biden said Russia.
My retard put spread offer will fill then üòé
... was doing two 6's at a time. Shit had me way too jacked. Had to put that shit down.
Hoping to get one more sweet entry point for BABA before the end of the day. 280 and under would be perfect
ive been waiting for a sub 35 NIO dip to jump back in
This level of profit on stocks is going to make you believe you can only make more off of options. When you inevitably blow up your account trying I‚Äôll be here to laugh. Good luck though
The Russell is up about 3% from last night. They're pricing in good news for small caps.
Long HLYN instead. They actually have a working product.

There‚Äôs always the possibility of having co-presidents

I mean at this rate I could see it getting there but yeah it was prob too high of a strike to pick
I hope you‚Äôre right!
It doesn't matter who wins the election. What matter is that we'll only have one winner.
If SPY breaks 338 I swear to god.....
I have $5,000 in cash waiting to get 2023 leaps if market tanks 10% of more post elections. My current plan is:
$1500 in RKT
$1500 in HYLN
$2,000 in BABA

Yeah but you're not me and I'm buying puts
While you guys are losing money at NIO. I‚Äôm longing NKLA and will retire in 4 years
Holding AH?
We dump into close.  Once election is over there is no political motivation to pass a giant stimulus. On the off hand we get a blue wave and they do go ahead and pass the 3t stimulus, that means taxes go up everywhere.
Nope. It‚Äôs what zerohedge says some single unnamed ‚Äústrategist‚Äù at JPM says. It could be made up. It could be some crazy uncle guy who works there with a political bent.  It‚Äôs the equivalent of any tabloid trash out there
it did bro we are almsot +2% on all indexes
I bought at around the top yesterday and just barely made back the money I lost today, then I sold.
The power of wsb
Killing it.
wtf SPY $350 calls expiring tomorrow are selling for .35?????? I was gonna buy like 1000 and thought they'd be like .05
do it
I work at your mom's house
SQ, AMD, and ROKU have ruined me. Gonna need a miracle.
Who else getting drunk while the votes pour in? Pretty upset we won‚Äôt get most results of election tonight, last election was pretty lit to watch.
expire tomorrow
322
RKT got to 19.99 and was like ‚Äúnah, 20‚Äôs is unknown territory to me which I must avoid‚Äù
If bloody green probably it won‚Äôt considering it‚Äôs still pretty high
We‚Äôre still in a downward trend as it‚Äôs becoming more clear how overvalued tech is right now. With a pump tomorrow lots of people will buy calls, causing MMs to buy more shares to stay delta neutral, pushing us high enough for whales and institutions to get a good exit point.
Are you just arguing the semantics of it? That IV is crushing your options and not the other way around?

Honest question: will buying calls for VIX be a genius idea? it would be either bloody red or bloody green so VIX will go through the roof no??
Ah we‚Äôre back to this one?
Name is on point lol. And with that Vega is the change of option price for 1% movement in IV the same way Delta changes the option price with $1 movement in underlying stock price, yeah?

Why the fuck are these 11/6 40c for nio still cucking me when it‚Äôs this high? The underlying is higher then when I bought it yesterday by like 2$ and theta isn‚Äôt high enough to rape me this much still
What is crying and masturbating like?

What are y'all holding over night?
You sound like these evangelists from a church down the street
I see what you are saying; you don't want to buy some calls and place some spreads and have the price move away from you.

I'd put limit orders in, I usually do that by default. So when I placed the original put spread, the spread was at 1.50, my limit was for 1.7. MM's came to me. Same with the calls.

That is also why I advise running a continuous theta strategy around your calls and put spread to make up any differences and reduce max pain to 0
Yes
You're going to shit the bed. Don't do it!

**This Very Good Food stock. Its amazing what you can do with a low share float on a penny stock. Make sure every insider holds most of their shares but then slowly sell into the market while hyping the shit out of it on YouTube. Shoot the bitch up on low volume. And make sure you're in a sector thats on trend, in this case they combined plant based and tech. Its now approaching 500 million market cap on 1 million sales. And they spent 2 mil to get those sales. Mostly on youtube promoters. Where the fuck is the SEC lol**

Listen, dumb fucks, IV is not something you feed into options pricing model, it's one of the things that comes *out* of it. 

Price precedes IV; IV is a reflection of that fucking movement of price.  If MMs increase the price of an option due to an expected move in the underlying, IV changes.  IV does NOT fucking go up and down, crushing and inflating price.

Bruh, we talking about options. Its about what the hot stocks are and nothings hotter than NIO right now
none of these companies will they own the government.
Momentus has developed a water-fueled propulsion system and vehicle called Vigoride to provide that ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù transportation to satellites once they are launched into space on rockets. After test-flying a prototype in 2019, Momentus has lined up a partnership with SpaceX and signed contracts with small satellite operators, notably the internet-of-things play Swarm, to ferry their spacecraft to the right orbit.

The company is effectively a middleman‚Äîits backers call it a space infrastructure company‚Äîthat enables SpaceX and other rocket makers to provide more flexible service, while allowing satellite operators to spend more time and resources on their spacecraft‚Äôs payload than on figuring out how to get it where it‚Äôs going.

Should‚Äôve adjusted to 1000 for inflation
I think it's Australian
It‚Äôs kind of a big deal, right?
That's before they even report earnings. I think you should buy further out or lower the strike if you can. Not sure what's going on today, but over the past few months NIO's held pretty flat and only been bumped up when there's good news.
The Premium on VXX my gd lol
Is today a big sell day because of the election? I'm presuming if its undecided tonight the market will tank tomorrow.
not yet but working on it
Guys I am not gonna touch NIO because it will stop mooning once I do

Not just serial killers, but studies are trying to link leaded gasoline babies to the crack era as well.
I think we're past that stage where the government is strong enough to break up large companies.

Regarded.
There is always a bounce. Even during the March crash the market would never go more than 10-12% down before bouncing up 5%. We were at 10% down just two days ago and at the fat September correction support. It's tempting fate to start shorting at that point.

With that said, I have no idea where the market's going to go after this point. We're at the crossroads where we're neither overbought or oversold.
Bought in @470. Also zoom @450

SVXY is going to the moon on Friday, mark my words.
First time here and already a üåàüêª
NIO is valued more than Tesla in terms of delivery numbers. NIO‚Äôs market cap is 40 billion whereas Tesla is 400 billion. Tesla delivered 140k vehicles in Q3 with positive EPS whereas Nio delivered 12k vehicles with most probably negative EPS. NIO‚Äôs delivery numbers are almost 12 times less than Tesla. At this valuation NIO is expected to grow faster than Tesla. And it doesn‚Äôt even account for Tesla‚Äôs innovation in batteries and self driving. No thanks, I will just invest in Tesla.

No leave ACB alone, they have bad management, big losses quarter after quarter with profits no where in sight. Canadian stocks allow dilution so they get watered down and that kills your stock value. PLNHF is similar market cap and is a killing it in Nevada. 1 location does 12% of the states sales and their expanding to SoCal Q1 2021. The industry is growing big but there is a lot of shit companies too, the etfs MJ and HMLSF are not good investments because they have the losers. Pick your top 2-3 favorites. 
Also I've heard good things about GTBIF but i'm not familiar with the fundamentals.  Cheers bro I hope this gives you some insight and makes you a couple bucks.

Reason for being up I have to guess is because today is election and it has been said that stimulus will be coming after election. So I mean could be due partly to that.

How often would you use this sort of a protection strategy, generally? On any position that's more than X% of your portfolio? Or any position that has gained at least +Y%?
You'll see when your puts expire worthless
Boy are you going to be disappointed

QE is publicly available information and it drove confidence in the market, which led big money to flood in, but they didn't directly influence prices. They introduced a policy that caused optimism (too much in my opinion, but still).

Retard, I have not had a very interesting day, so my mind has been wandering, I found myself asking myself a question after watching a shrek meme, exactly how big is shreks dick.

Firstly o researched the average penis size worldwide which was reported to be 5.16 inches when erect. Based on this I found out what the average height was in the swampy country of Rwanda, the data shows the average hieght is 5ft 2 inches. With this data I calculated that the average penis is 12.0155% of the human body in Rwanda.

Using this data I searched up what is shreks height, the most common answer was 8ft (96 inches) based on the findings of my previous data I calculated that shreks dick is 11.53 inches.

This lead to me wondering what Fiona (shreks wife) height was as she must have been ruined pre ogre transformation, based on my research she was 5.10 meaning that pre shrek transformation she was taking ogre dick account for over 19% of her height!

25c ESPR 1/15/21

Stock plummeted 15% today, but just already has a released drug since March and is growing, just less than expected they think because of less people going to doctors offices since covid. Is scheduled to launch in Europe soon. I was just looking as a day/swing trade since it was a top mover on RH but after looking it up a bit, I feel like it might be a solid monthly/long term play.  I already invested all my grandmas lunch money on it but would love some autistic opinions on it.
It's not tomorrow yet
Jack Ma shitted on Gyna. Now he has to go to reeducation camp and ANT IPO cancelled
The GOP wants like a $500b stimulus with no direct checks to people. If you think that the GOP will race to pass a big stimulus *after* the election you haven't been following.

GOP = small or no stimulus.

DEM = big stimulus.

This isn't complicated. Dems wanted a 3 trillion bill and came down to 2.2 trillion. GOP wants 500b and Mnuchin wants a 1.6t stimulus. Any notion that a Trump/GOP win means a big stimulus or a stimulus before 2021 is a lie people are telling themselves.

The political gamesmanship in play though is the GOP counting on a Dem sweep so they can own the 3 trillion bill so the GOP can run on 'fiscal responsibility' in 2022, just like the 2008/2009 situation. Rinse and repeat.

GOP cause a recession, Dems fix it, GOP points to Dems fixing it as being reckless with money.

Big red wave is not feasible. There‚Äôs no possibility of Rs retaking the house unless all the polling is much more inaccurate than 2016. I think more than anything, the market wants a clear result and an end to uncertainty.

I really hope tomorrow we crash so I can buy Nio calls and cheap amazon leaps
Yes.
What app is that?
No, i don't think that's it. High uncertainty leads to high(er) volatility, i know there has been a downturn for awhile no and expect a rebound but why this week of all weeks, anyway we are still too high imo.

If there is uncertainty, why are we up?

Sounds good.  I hope it is working out for you.  I was running the numbers this afternoon and staying mostly long and all in the market, I am up 74% for the year.  

I tried to time/short the market back in 2009.  Every headline kept saying we are nearing the end of the world and the stock market went for a 10+ year run.  I decide fuck that, I am getting on this bandwagon until I am pushed off!

This time was no different.  My recommendation is to pick a direction where the market will be 3 or 6 months from now.  Load up on your favorite instrument (puts, calls, stock, etc.) and just buy more if the market goes against your direction.  If you are right, you will have made tons of money!!!

BTW the market has a higher propensity to go up than it does down.
Still got plenty of time in the month. Hahah
>young chinese go to starbucks to drink frappuccinos.  China starbucks also sell tea and juice teas
yep lol, fucking biggest rally ever!

the dump was last week, the market is always forward looking
Fuck it. BUY CALLS ON NIO. China loves for Biden

Stupid question, why obviously green?
Don‚Äôt be shy TSLA to 500 by Friday
lol damn dude, you should stop trading...
damn so many bears are scared. Saying "dump is coming, dump is coming" to reassure themselves. Bitch ass fools, dump happened last week! and the past 2 months was straight up consolidation/correction.
damn, what is that?
Gamestop on the front page? Calls it is.
especially anyone who bought TSLA in 1929. I bet those guys are all billionaires now
Always using limit order, you‚Äôre just one dumbass away from selling everything at market to some guy for 0.01
If the election has been called for Biden and the outcome is clear and Senate is held by Dems, probably green for a bit. Contested results: probably a little red unless there are serious problems (contested ballots, etc.), in which case worse. Probably about the same for Biden win and Republican Senate (slower burn but potentially lasting into 2021).
Roku is doing its best impression of Wil E Coyote falling off a cliff
Nice

Yeah man and i have zero plan on when I‚Äôm getting out. 29C 11/13 and doubled down 33C 1/15/21. Probably the 29‚Äôs EOD/EOW

Lol - $VBR, which I bought right after Trump was inaugurated, is basically at the same price as it was then. Not sure how anything other than stimulus optimism is bullish rn for small caps, but it is kinda interesting that it's managed no gains in 4 years.

Autist WSB trader selling his assets after blowing up his account during the Great Depression - 1929 colourized
Do you guys use limit orders when selling out of a position? I always use one when buying, but when selling I usually just want out ASAP. I know without one I'll probably get filled at a price that's less than I wanted, but if the price is rapidly dropping I'd rather be out for sure at a bad price than stuck in the position as it drops to a worse price.
Lays 5 million at +200 = 15 million dollar payout. 5 mill of that is his own money. Makes 10 million profit.

I certainly wouldn't go to bed without turning positions into spreads.
This is a stupid stat. Wall street is donating to both sides but Trump refuses it.
This country turned into a reality tv show 4 years ago and that‚Äôs why the market doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck it‚Äôs doing. The one constant is jpow and he don‚Äôt fuck around. Long the market

I‚Äôll never buy an ETF just out of pure spite for r/stocks
Can someone please help me on what will the market do tomorrow?! 

Bigly green sounds like obvious thing, like, too obvious and it seems sentiment all over different trading/investing platforms seems to expect this also. Which is why i keep going/thinking, that perhaps it will be surprised red.

You could buy yourself such a fast electric scooter with $2,500!
yes, I believe
same.. oh well
Yeah, if you're not betting your whole portfolio on your take then STFU. (Biden for the win, TAN, ICLN, and MJ Nov 20 calls)
Another idea is cash out initial investment of 100k and put it somewhere else (TSLA would move your single security risk to now just single sector risk).  Tax implications are also something to consider.  

None the less, congrats on your gains!!! Can I ask, if you sold your house, where are you staying now? or basically have your monthly overhead expenses increased or decreased from the house sale?

Everyone is expecting a dip so MMs won‚Äôt let that happen

People closing shorts can push price up.
Meaning its a green day.
buy at eod and then sell at open
It's going to be a blowout victory for Biden lol I voted for a 3rd party but I'm just saying. Volatility is going to be absolutely destroyed. Do not long volatility..if you missed the last week you missed your chance.

18 Not impossible but I just had some leftover and at the time it was the cheapest call I felt ok about. Bought some shares at 13 which isn‚Äôt the best but can at least break even by eoy I imagine
If you were a pro, you would of figured out the cost of the original car at time the picture was taken and the percentage loss. Then apply the calculated percentage loss to the current value of a Tesla and updated the note accordingly.

I sold my $9 11/6 calls today, can say paper hands but there's just no clue what will happen post election. I'm holding onto my $9 1/15 calls though. I think those will print after the next earnings report and the transition of power.

Where‚Äôs the stimulus step bro? I can‚Äôt find it!
Have a plan before you buy -- why are you buying?  What's your max loss?  Max profit?  If you bought "to make money" you'll probably lose it.  If you bought puts because you think tomorrow will be a shit-show, wait until tomorrow.  It sucks losing value instantly but if you do your DD and have a plan, it helps (my SPY puts were down 50+% this AM, recovering for what I hope is printing tomorrow).

It‚Äôs all fun and games until he has a mysterious malady and is never heard from in this world again. I got into calls both weekly and long. Could have sold 30% up now I‚Äôm 30% down. Holding. He‚Äôs got to give some sort of press release about this with a new timeline for IPO and BABA still own a share of Ant and earnings is coming up.

I think we are going down an escalator that's moving up.
How many bought puts there looking for the bottom to fall out? Watch big money pump this now
Am still aroused, sir. Bought even more puts!
This was like a put-dip... until now!

You show me a paystub for $200, I quit my job and work for you.

-100% on the trade but I'm sure some do go all in into puts.
Best you can do is 1dte. Nothing expires today.
Looks like I'm gonna be wronggggggggggg.

Again
Aphria's market cap is 2.5b not 3.4b, unless this is an estimation for next year. In which case you should be buying weed stocks if it's going to go up 40%.

üíé af shits gonna dump hard tonight
Imagine that, we dumping into Friday
This is what I‚Äôm thinking too
The dip will be bought, and the bears will be taught
Think we bounce from here and close near hod, closed these $336p for $5.10 didn't think 50% is possible https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmv1ax/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_03_2020/gaz6mcd?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3 - grabbed some baba 11/13 $300c
Depressing for others? Maybe. I‚Äôm pretty happy myself
Use a real platform like RH

What's the strike? I mean if we survive the election and can refocus on numbers than Nov 5th is TTWO and EA and then they report so if there's some positive juices flowing we could get this party started before year end

Not too late to fomo into puts
Made another 2k off my Nio shares today!

I love this stock...
duh. Have you seen how much SPY contacts are just 1 dollar otm? Theres like a +3 dollar premium on it
I‚Äôm expecting the same thing. I‚Äôll definitely be buying more calls of NIO.
Holup
Damn, where you live that they let you have that much product? Decriminalized limit in my state is 1 oz per person.
Everybody in shambles
I get what you mean from past results, but if everyone actually voted things could change significantly. Either way not voting is the most pathetic, unamerican thing you can do
never--mind
> What are their fees like?

Damn bro use Google... The other questions are relevant, but this one is better answered by you. You've only got a handful of brokers to choose from. If you care about fees, look them up yourself.

Does $200 make you feel like a big shot?
310 by when?
Lmao Jack Ma really went off and started talking shit to the Chinese Govt right before his IPO? That's a big dick move right there.

I might get back into BABA with this wild dip. Earnings coming up too
Dude get some beard oil and start combing that shit in. My job makes me clean shave or have a beard no longer then 1.5inches. they are hyper cristal too if you have a curly scraggly sort of beard hair. So I get hella shit for mine when I grow it out. The itch is insane for my and beard oil and conditioning soap helped when I had it. Don't got any brands to recommend cause that is kinda like the shampoo issue. You gotta find what works for your hair and skin. Best wishes though. Beards get MAD RESPECT.
The flush is starting
Yes
This is almost back to where we started the day at. Still down -3.5K. Lmao congrats theta gang.
Uh, this might be a sling shot

Could this text **be** any more bold?
Time for 2:00 liftoff

EDIT: Well, they tried. Big volume jumps, but little green candles.
vix rising lol
ACB? That's pretty retarded. ACB is dog shit and has done a reverse split fairly recently. HEXO is about to do a reverse split too. I can see it being a good hedge for American Companies. But there's a good chance I'm more retarded.
Made $200 today. I‚Äôm taking interviews
Buy the dip
I did the same thing today. 

NIO 34p 11/6
Exactly. I‚Äôm usually buying 3-4 month exp so I have been putting up with it. But it‚Äôs hard. Also- like WTF my shit doesn‚Äôt refresh usually and I‚Äôm always wondering how much I‚Äôm loosing; not asking for real time but even a delay would be helpful.
I mean you got me there. I feel like DC could get nuked and the AI headlines would just be like ‚ÄúTech surges as Anti-Trust lawsuits no longer a concern for investors‚Äù
Theta gang doesn‚Äôt mind the volatility
Poor bears Lmaoo... about to lose it all
Here comes the dump right on time
And here begins the dump. Close positions now
He bought?
If that happens I will fucking quit my job eod tomorrow and buy $2000 of weed

Big bois are patient. No hurry. Wait for all the $ to get in the pot.
Biden is favoured based on polling averages in both NC and Florida. Texas Trump is favoured but Biden could win if it's a blue wave and that would put the election to bed pretty much immediately.

Nah ten minutes. 12:40-12:50.
made into spreads to get back some premium
Nah I could‚Äôve sold for a slight loss before I got assigned. Just selling covered calls, would‚Äôve rather been in lower but AAPL not bad to be sitting on.
I understand. Wouldn't that be a short term solution to a long-term problem?
Why
my calls are BLEEDING
True I‚Äôll tell her we‚Äôre having southern bbq for dinner instead

A couple of weeks ago, my father in law was telling me how he had been trading stocks based off of advice he was getting from his fucking UT football message board. First- I called him a pussy for not going all in on FD's and then I immediately went cash gang because if that doesn't tell you to pull it all out of the market, I am not sure what else would
So is $X gonna rally hard again if Trump wins?
playing the swings both ways is the way.  Nothing but profit.  It dumps I sell the puts.  It pumps I take profit on the calls.  We ain't trading flat these days.
If you have balls, buy calls!
Lower it to 8%

What is this, a dump for ants?
Account up 117% since Friday but ok
I just bought some vanilla calls
BABA down 8% is so fucking tantalizing. Too bad I'm a broke bitch.
Big red. Contested election will be a big cherry on the top.
I have 0 on spy, bullshit premiums - they‚Äôre split between cruises, banks, oil, xlf, xle, xlp, xli, RTX, FB, SMH.

you act like bears arent as retarded and didnt piss away their profits the last two days
Curious question from a non american. Why would the expectation of a democrat win rise stocks?
Market makers agreeing to a price and settling large sums privately
In actuality...

&#x200B;

A candidate must receive an [absolute majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_majority) of electoral votes (currently 270) to win the presidency or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, that election is determined via a contingency procedure established by the 12th Amendment. In such a situation, the House chooses one of the top three presidential electoral vote-winners as the president, while the Senate chooses one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote-winners as vice president.
Anyone playing HLT earnings? Feel like with a second wave their outlook may be dismal, but don't know if all that is already priced in. Thoughts?
what time poll end?
He's worse for trade.  Protectionist policies are all posturing that hurt yourself as much as, if not vastly more than your opponent.  

US companies have suffered from the Chinese tariff, while China did take a hit but not nearly as bad.  As would have been predicted by anyone who is familiar with global economics post 1700s.  

Baba will probably do just as well with either president.  They have an entire world to trade with.
Mostly stock and April 21 and even some Jan 22. I really didn't think that it would pop off like this until they were able to report holiday numbers. But the fact that's the SI is up to ‚âà70MM is insane
I say definitely but maybe not a weekly call, maybe a month out or so. Last earnings it sold off for some reason on great numbers and then popped literally two days after.
Don‚Äôt care, didn‚Äôt ask, Still holding calls
Someone talk me through this play

I feel like a lot of iPhone's are going to be looted tonight and tomorrow. 

I was thinking of buying calls on AAPL because now more people will be locked into the Apple ecosystem. Thoughts?

So if Biden wins, you got Trump who might go scorched-earth in a tantrum in the last 2 months before he leaves.

If Trump wins, he'll have a free for all 4 years with no more re-election to worry about.  And probably will focus more on his policy of Tweets that sends the market on surprise drops and spikes to help line up the pockets of his family.

I thought about switching onto NIO, what‚Äôs your price target? 

Idk how much market share they can grab in China though. I feel like Tesla will be building more factories in China and other parts of Asia. India has been one of them
VIX slithering upwards like a sneaky lil slippery snake

I wouldn‚Äôt trade the weeklies tbh. You can get longer expiry for slightly higher, so if you‚Äôre wrong, you won‚Äôt be annihilated.
Is there still hope for vix spike?
I feel like I've turned a corner as a trader maybe it's just dumb luck but I'm a million times better at entry points and exits then I was 6 months ago.
Can we get an AMA for people who bought calls today?

What is the logic of going into calls? we\`re up 5% since friday
What did jack say to piss them off?
**SELL**
Loss money on spy hedge today because of paper hands.  Held for only 20 minutes because market went straight up.  Now it‚Äôs back down. I‚Äôm pissed!  How do you harden these hands?
Trump _says_ he's mean.  But in reality he's a total pushover.  Biden _acts_ nice, but in reality he works with allies to pressure adversaries.  

It's like the guy who talks shit and then is a pussy when its time to put up, vs the guy who walks softly but carries a big stick.
lol spy IV is just stupid today. easily 2-3x normal price on a tuesday
And now that it has been fulfilled...
Turn around Tuessssdaaaayyy
Thanks homie
I think if it‚Äôs a clear winner the markets will rally.
Boobs I think
 why
GME is a timebomb, sell
What happens if it‚Äôs 269-269 tonight?
Nevermind youre right. im thinking with FOMO again.
You know it. More stable
Correct. Call 1-800-Dumbass to collect your prize
SPY is getting weak.
People are waiting to buy options. The leaps are coming. Florida will be the tipping point.
What if Biden abolishes the stock market? 

üò≥üï∂ü§èüèª
pretty lame satire then tbh
where can i see short borrow rates for stocks in ibkr? like for GME?

i have 70 GME shares, can i lend them or is my broker doing it automatically?
Not a secret. A strong move up followed by a pull back to around the 50% point is typically a bullish sign. It bounced right off that point. Still needs to break trend though which is the important part and it hasn't done yet so can still drop more.
Seriously tho why is Apple so weak ?
you say wendys too like wendys isn't food haha
As far as options is concerned I‚Äôm not too sure and would be weary in these crazy times though I do believe there will be a run up to earnings. I‚Äôm holding 1300 shares so I‚Äôm just chillin and waiting for the landing
Damnit got in calls and left puts too early
Vxx is just the obvious move right now

Major support at $50 because I have an order for 10 shares at $50
Yeah, I know that's why it went up yesterday and today. I'm sure it'll keep climbing especially closer to NIO Day but I'm thinking my premium might drop over the next few days so I could sell now and get in again at a cheaper price.
Funko Pop earnings and Rocket earnings are the move
Dump them tits girl!
amzn is like an inflated coin

I think if they sort out the ANY ipo on the near term and explain what happened it could get back up to highs rather quickly, also I think earnings are next week.

If the market is pricing in trump losing then these Twitter puts should skyrocket
He was a bull you dumbass
Lol same
Serious and non-political question. To me the past two green days seem to be anticipating a strong Biden and Democratic win. If we get a pretty clear picture of the results and they are as expected before open tomorrow are we thinking another big green day or a little drawback?? I'm trying to decide if I should sell some calls I'm up on today or tomorrow.
Bought some $25 jan 2023 rkt calls, I'll see you all in 3 years üôè

Nice never cash out with a loss always redepo and you will hit it sooner or later
Not at all brother.


Fully Diluted Earnings per Share (EPS) was $0.69, compared with $(0.29) in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.51, or up 738 percent, compared with $(0.08) in the prior-year quarter.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was positive $77 million, compared with a use of cash of $(36) million in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow generation was positive $73 million, compared with a use of cash of $(45) million in the prior-year quarter.

wait how r ppl still selling baba and paypal at these levels?
I got blown up by MGI. Always hedge distressed companies because bullshit abounds
Just might be autistic enough to work
Yeah very true. I think, and this is just my opinion, that the most interesting scenario will be an early declaration of victory from Trump if the earliest reporting states are all Republican.
They're a long term pick for me.
Just like seal team six, drill team six moves stealthily and you‚Äôll never know when they hit you.

Man, once this elections bullshit is over, Nov. is going to be rocket fuel.  Moderna AND Pfizer are both expected to report.  If the data are good, the market is going to blow its load.
is it me or are options not moving as fast in terms of buying and selling
Y‚Äôall ever seen a NIO car? Shits ugly af, especially compared to a Tesla. Not saying the stock won‚Äôt keep going up, it‚Äôs just ugly
Depends on time frame my man
This is just in response to all the retards frothing at the mouth that "we are about to dump"

Like $3 drop on the SPY and they are celebrating going from -98% to -96%
-3% EOD
Idk man I am in the pool for some of these surveys. I never answer that I would pay cash because that's stupid. I put every expense on a card and pay it off before due. I always put this in the review at the end, they never ask "do you have enough cash to cover a $400 expense?" They ask "how would you cover a $400 expense?" I could easily be counted as a borrower under the wrong methodology, even though I could cough up $400 liquid no problem. Statistics based on flawed survey questions are 2 layers of misleading.
Lol we are?!?!

SPY in the 330s is bear territory??? Dont be a retard
Big stimmy is being priced in along with blue wave
Smart money is getting in now
This is the ground floor
So do I buy?
It can never hold its gains. Its been consolidating here for months. Earnings is going to bring it over $30 where it will stay.
Your mom was crazy overpriced
You underestimate our ability to buy the top and sell the dip on options only.

But yeah anyone who bought shares is sitting pretty happy.
Foreshadowing
They're trying to scare us away from the profits
LOL triggered, it's not 2016 anymore trumpy
Definitely, but not necessarily today. I'm expecting an earnings beat as a lot of the stuff sold on Amazon is repurposed from Alibaba and Amazon had good earnings again. Plus as soon as the Ant IPO gets approved and goes through it will pop.
Haha... My same thought
I use vanguard for my Roth to trade options and your not missing anything. Shit sucks. It‚Äôs like 1992 on dial up.
just FOMO‚Äôd the shit out of Nio ü§°
I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs being pushed down today by MMs. I noticed when we were still climbing mid-day that vix wasn‚Äôt going any farther down and TLT started climbing a little (scared investors). Also not sure if it‚Äôs much of an indicator but I‚Äôve noticed the ETF TAN has been down every day on the day before a drop, like people are already taking their money out there because they already know. Idk, I‚Äôm no wizard, but I feel safe in my vix calls.
ding ding ding
God this makes me want to go in on 0dte puts if it stays here
U dumbass

IIUC ANT would have to reserve more cash aside now. 30% of all loans they take instead of 2% which means a fundamental shift in how they manage money.

What the markets value above all is stability and based on some reading the markets seems to be anticipating a Biden and Democratic win in general, and therefore a more stable period upcoming.
Correct
AMZN is a steel under 3000 and you missed that Bears. Lmao.
The issue with that is all the states that are pretty much a lock for either candidate are the ones you'll find out first about. The battleground states won't be able to report until late tonight at best, and a few days from now at worst.

The dollar vallue doesnt make sense for 600k call options unless they all expire within the next few weeks, it‚Äôs like ~ $4 a contract w that math adding up to 2.6 mil

I think most people have made their plays. We wait for the results now. No one is waiting till the moments before market close on election day to make their moves lol.

Owww, dddaaaannng, that hurts
I mean it's just as helpful as someone complaining about movement relative to earnings performance. 

That one little number barely means shit during the earnings report. The market already has a good idea what that earnings number is. It's all about future guidance and what orange man tweets.

Where are all the bears screaming, "DEAD CAT BOUNCE"
Pypl
Nah that just brings them over here too
We aren‚Äôt going to have the results today unless there is a landslide victory. That doesn‚Äôt seem likely. Sc is already projecting late results, others may follow.
10 labor hours so about $120 bucks wow such big prize
Just my two cents here - I think the market is pricing in a democratic sweep and decisive victory, therefore erasing Trumps path to contest the election and the ensuing chaos that would create. Just looking at Trumps map to victory there is no realistic scenario where he wins outright tonight. In trumps bullish election scenario he does well in many swing states like Pennsylvania and declares victory before mail in ballots are counted. As mail in ballots trickle in over the next week this will most likely be taken to the Supreme Court and will create the prolonged confusion that the market is afraid of.
Share your secrets Warren!!!
which ones better uvxy or vxx for options?
the best part is this retard didnt even account for inflation LMAO
With enough volatility, small dumps can cause large dumps

Biden is now a 2 to 1 favorite, 67% chance of winning.  
I think Trump was +700-ish at the beginning of the day for last election.

You'd think if everyone was betting on Biden, they'd make the odds better for Trump in order to try and balance out the wagers.
Big money buys in when you least expected.
Any hope BABA will recover to 303?
stopped out at $33 yesterday and missing a little. Take profits when you can

I need that shit above $4 by Friday. Every body who wants to see an IMAX again in their lives needs to be pumping this bitch.
Why would any buying happen today. Does that market feel that it outcome doesn't matter? Either way no stimmy, so I don't see why the markets popped.
Bears praying for even the smallest of dumps right now.

Keep praying, there must be some investors that have waited till the day of a highly volatile presidential election, after weeks of red, to sell their large positions.
Does it?  Or does inflation drive up the cost of living to the point that labor wants more pay, but can't get it because someone overseas is willing to work without modern labor protections for a fraction of the pay?

I don‚Äôt think anyone has any idea who‚Äôs going to win
Not today, but back then it wasn't possible for most countries to HAVE an auto industry because of how hard it would have been to coordinate the supply chain.  

But all of the money and material made to produce that car stayed inside the country which means that much more American labor went into that car than is true today.  It wasn't really a qualifying statement for anything other than that car represented more opportunity for labor in this country than an American "made" car does today.

> There's a regulatory draft that requires small business lenders like Ant to warehouse 30% of the loans they originate vs the 2% that they currently have on balance sheet.

For those who've been investing for a while, is there a common pattern for how the market behaves around election time?
If there wasn't so much uncertainty surrounding the election, I would say that this is one of the days where you buy at close and sell at open.
I'm aware. But some styles transcend time. Well-fitting, simple clothes will always look good. If this guy wore this today, people would appreciate the suit. Hence this post.
Markets are forward looking and literally everyone on both sides of the isle is expecting stimulus to happen (because it is happening). Market pumping hard yesterday and today suggests people are expecting an uncontested election which likely is not going to happen. First one is neutral second one bearish.
Poots?!

Earnings plays are terrible rn. 6 out of 7 big tech earnings tanked the stock. GOOG was the only one that came out green.
It does run up to events tho. Exactly 1 day before the event it'll run up, and if ur not sure, the EU market trades 7 hours earlier than that, if theres a green candle, its gonna run up hard. Just please make sure to sell BEFORE the day of the event, because ppl will wanna take profits on the event day but there wont be much buyers, and down it goes. Lol. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

They‚Äôre the only company I‚Äôve bought from since illinois legalized because their stuff is hands down the best. It‚Äôs about the product, their company history can be sparkling but if their weed is shit they‚Äôre going to do shit. I‚Äôm already up 30% since buying in September, hop on the train.

spy, you better march back up those stairs and clean that room

this man fucks.
What does that have to do with uncertainty? The bubble popped in March and was then reinflated by Trump and co. Fat loans to companies through the Fed and treasury. Unwavering support of big fiscal stimulus. 

Biden winning may lead to a short-term rally, but the eviction wave poses a big systematic risk and will make any rally short-lived (I‚Äôm assuming the evictions will happen as property owners keeping squatters would be far more costly). Stimulus in 2021 will be too late as defaults will follow shortly after. JPOW can limit the damage by tying over a few owners, but some will be ineligible for aid due to existing leverage, so defaults will be inevitable by December. 


If Trump wins, we‚Äôll get a stimulus sooner and that risk won‚Äôt be realized. Trump won‚Äôt pass a stimulus if he loses too.

There will be no additional pump from either of these events and a major sell off if either doesn‚Äôt happen.

I'm not too sure any such amount exists in China. Even Chinese billionaires [have gone missing after openly criticizing the party](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/world/asia/china-ren-zhiqiang.html). Plus the fact of the matter is that the Chinese party does not allow businesses to grow and any significant wealth to be accumulated without allegiance to the party. Part of that allegiance involves engaging in corruption which is then used as blackmail against you should you fall out of line.

And they‚Äôre all voting Trump now, wild
Load up on poots kids!

You should vote for nothing else that your single vote in your local elections does matter, and a lot of your local policy that plays out WILL affect you.
entire market rose on a short squeeze, lmao.
Wow, I want what your having.
Position sizing for the win. Tiny position with BABA calls for Ant and earnings. All gone...don't even care. BABA got what it deserved.
I dont need this kind of negativity in my life.
Damnit. Do you have a link to where I can make my $5 mil bet?
Does it ever not dump after being up around 3-4%?
Just leave the $62k to ride and put your initial money into other things so you don't get wrecked. Concentration isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, but 100% in one very volatile stock is a pretty bad idea. People think stop losses will save them but forget that the biggest moves are always *between* days in the market so that stop loss could easily cause you to sell at the bottom because the initial move after bad news is usually overblown. 

If you don't want to sell at least pick a price target and sell covered calls, with your shares you could sell \~68 $45 calls for Jan 21 for a total of \~ $22,000, if it hits $45 you'll get assigned and leave with a \~$328,000. Price goes up or sideways and doesn't hit $45, then you get to keep the $22k and your shares. Even if NIO went to 0, you still have $22k, and if it dips down but you think it will come back, you can just buy back the calls for a profit.

> There's not much point in me laying out a case for us to argue, because you're already starting from the supposition that it's debunked.

That's the whole point of convincing me which is to get me to change positions.

> You might be better off steel-manning the case for Austrian economics and then saying why it fails.

Well shit why didn't you ask? That's fucking easy as pie to do. 

Over the last fifty years, economists have settled on some very broad areas of consensus. The first is, as famous libertarian monetary economist Milton Friedman wrote, "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon". When the supply of money outstrips the demand, prices rise. And this is by no means limited to fiat currencies; see the great Spanish inflation of the 16th & 17th centuries, thanks to the steady influx of gold from the New World. Or check out the price of basic commodities in mining towns during the Gold Rush, when all anyone had was gold.

The second is that a little bit of inflation is okay--possibly even beneficial, since it helps the economy to overcome the problem of sticky wages when the relative value of labour has fallen. But a lot of inflation is very, very bad. Exhibit A is Zimbabwe; Exhibits B-‚àû are every other economy that has had inflation near or above the double-digit mark; the higher the inflation, the worse the economy did. The feeling that the currency will experience an unpredictable amount of inflation dampens the willingness of the citizens to save and invest, which is why so many third-world loans are denominated in dollars.

The third is that deflation is also bad, and at the lower percentage values, often even worse than inflation. This surprises/offends/meets with the frank disbelief of many "sound money" types, who think that, barring local shortage, in an ideal world everything ought to cost the same or less than it did when Grandpa was a boy. (These sorts of opinions are cemented further by the fact that Grandpa, who is often the source of them, is usually living on a fixed income, and therefore feels that he would make out better in a deflationary economy.) The problem is, deflation does rather devastating things to anyone who has debt, since they now have to repay what they borrowed in more expensive dollars. Deflation means that, thanks to the abovementioned sticky wages, the economy has to deal with demand shocks by lowering output. Deflation can result in what's known as a liquidity trap, a concept pioneered by liberal economist John Maynard Keynes and best elucidated by liberal economist Paul Krugman back before he left economics writing to focus on his hatred of George W. Bush. Deflation is what made the Great Depression so memorable. Deflation is so bad that almost everyone agrees that moderate inflation, in the range of 1-2%, is better than risking even a small amount of deflation.

I did that with AMD and TSM, but then after a long time of basing around 50-60 they both just took off and ate my covered calls.
I don't know, at this point, might as well just wait until tomorrow. Anything can happen.

I trade on an if/then basis. I would buy puts if SPY gets to 345 but that doesn't mean I'll buy calls expecting it to get to 345 because I don't know if it will or not.

For example, my plan was to buy calls if SPY drops to 323 which it did last week but I didn't buy puts when it was in the 330s because I didn't know if it would drop to 323 or not but once it did, I knew there was a high chance it would bounce. Unfortunately, I sold way too early, it's the scalper in me. 

I did the same when I bought puts at around 350, sold too early.
Ehh ma is worth tens of billions if the ccp gives him some ridiculous terms he can tell them to fuck off that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm nervous

I would love to see where you saw Trump turnout was historically high because I have not seen or heard that anywhere. 

I do agree the methodology in '16 did not take in the white vote in regards to college educated and not. Most of the respected ones have now fixed that issue in their polling. Trump in '20 has strengthened his core base in regard to fandom (cultish if you ask me) but that makes his opposition hate him more and alienate the moderate Republicans and Independents.

Said another way, VIX starting to get a boner.
Civil war is priced in
Wow! CNBC: Moderate Democrats pushing for standalone bills on Unemployment and PPP

BULLISH AF!
good luck
Why would you think airlines would go up when worldwide lockdowns are happening again and Covid cases are at all time highs.
Chinese government flexing their muscle. People remembered that China could delist BABA from foreign markets at will. BABA shares have a real possibility of becoming worthless.

Well...
Thanks man - that was helpful. I just went ahead and sold the shares around 207 since that‚Äôs well above my breakeven when considering the premium. I just wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to make a profit if I sold now, or if I was still breakeven / negative. Your explanation helped!

CYA LATER NIO
Beware of the cursed BABA YAGA
Ever have a sore dick from pounding it one too many times :/
I have a NIO $35C 1/15/21 that's up 70%. Would now be a good time to sell and buy back in at a cheaper premium or should I just hold until closer to the NIO event in January?
delusional
No
The way things should always be.
Kind of like voting Rep in Cali or Dem in Texas is the most pointless way to waste time but seen as a civic responsibility
I would guess MMs believe blue wave - pumping on massive stimmy, yet oil is selling off
in the future every stock is worth thousands of dollars a share and money is meaningless
Bro theres dozens of cards out there with 0% APR for 16 months!!
it already tanked last week
I'm purely guessing ... The price rarely goes below it's 14 day MA. Right now it's around $29.15ish but MA will go up with today's pump. I'm likely getting back in if it hits 31ish but I'll always check the charts etc first and market conditions.

Shares, leaps, otm w about a month to exp are good plays IMHO. I'd keep an eye out for ER.. I wouldn't sell ccs on them though for now if you eventually buy shares.
Kiss me by my zoom puts babey

If it's so easy why dont you just open a margin account and do it instead of trolling? Even hedge funds, institutions, and prop trading firms would kill for 3 percent gain per day that you're describing.

Real key issue:

-Jack Ma criticized the gouvernment and system too hard for once and CCP decided to send a warning

Chinese companies work because the CCP allows it. They can randomly pump 10% and lose 10% according to the whims of the communist party. Nobody here should forget that.
I would fucking kill myself because I don‚Äôt have the patience to wait that shit out and I would definitely lose my whole account

I really wonder what MM are planning. Are they that confident there will not be a contested election? But like MM fashion they have a need like hunger to fucker over retail.
No that‚Äôs a liberal talking point.

you're expecting WSB people to know what that means.
Go over to politics bro. Nobody wants to hear this shit.
Oh ffs Najerian he‚Äôs a fucking monkey for sure. He called usual options for ups last week at 175, big boys ran it up day before cashed in and it dumped to 158 the next day.

Yessir. Depends on your entry point (did you fomo on Wednesday at the top?) but we will get another spike this week. 

I would not hold past this week unless we get other bad news.
>	Most of the raw materials were sourced domestically too 

Is your argument here that sourcing raw materials domestically makes something cheaper? Maybe I‚Äôm misinterpreting your comment, but isn‚Äôt the entire point of importing raw materials in the modern day is because it‚Äôs cheaper? 

It certainly wouldn‚Äôt have been cheaper to import back in the 20s, but is that even relevant given that importing materials like that was almost universally cost prohibitive?

Plan was to hold my nio calls till week of expiration. But since the market was open later cuz of fall back I decided to grab my profit.  

Plan was to hold and exercise if they where way above the strike.

Perpendicular means they are like X and Y axes. Movement in X direction doesn't have any influence on Y and vice versa. Knowing value of X can't help you with value of Y. 

If they are parallel then moving along one, either positive or negative, also impacts the other with some correlation. Knowing value of one tells you *something* about the value of the other.

There's no attack there, it's simple motivation. If they accept that printing money is bad, and admitted that to the public, they'd have to stop printing and explain to people why they've continued to steal from the poor and middle class. 

There's not much point in me laying out a case for us to argue, because you're already starting from the supposition that it's debunked. You might be better off steel-manning the case for Austrian economics and then saying why it fails. 

You make the vague statement that it's been discredited, and Austrians 
 see the business cycle at work every time the Fed pumps more cash into the system, inflating the bubble, and then acting surprised when it pops while they start printing even more.

Inflation as measured by the US govt is low, but they also keep changing the definition, don't they? We're also helped by the benefits we'd typically expect from a free market - products becoming cheaper to manufacture over time as manufacturing becomes more efficient. Ideally, we'd see this as continued deflation in prices, not inflation, with a stable currency. With a gold standard, your purchasing power would increase, and we'd see less speculation. It would likely make WSB much less interesting, but it would be better for the working class and encourage saving.
I didn't know Biden was going to tax me so much until 50 Cent said so.  Good lookin out fiddy
Oh he is most likely full or shit. Or just dumb as fuck and doesn‚Äôt know how vaccine trials work. But I assume it‚Äôs the former.

Baba better moon tm
SPX still has an expected move of $94.5 ($9.5 for SPY) for tomorrow's expiration. That's still 3% up or down from where we're at already! 
There's millions of dollars of hedges for $3,200 and below. I'm by no means saying that's happening, there's also millions on the call side too, but there's real cold hard cash being used to give substance to the threat of volatility, regardless of what we've already seen yesterday and so far today.
Holy fucking shit baba where u going

I'm still at around 31.  Was going to lower to around 24 but for some reason figured it would go lower than 18 and got lazy.  I'm apparently playing the long game.. the very long game.
market is up last two days because they see such a big biden landslide victory that trump won't be able to gin up any support or cause fo a loud-mouthed challenge
jack ma opened his fat mouth and criticized gyna. now ant ipo on hold, or off the table
What do you expect from FIT?  Isn't the merger price set at $7 per share?
I‚Äôm sure they are skewering him and agree he should have kept his mouth shut about the financial system, funny how these moguls can be their own worst enemy sometimes.  I do think it will be back on at some point, simply too much money at stake to keep it down forever, but yeah it could be months away now as they do damage control and return institutional investments.  It‚Äôs a huge blow for sure.
Why?
VXX ya cunt stop being gay, this shits broken

Why buy the afternoon before the election? Indices up 2% on the day seems like a very good indicator that the election is a strong upside catalyst. If you're buying, waiting until tomorrow could be a big missed opportunity.

Ouch, fucking Solarwedgie more like.
Vote Orange
the what?
so if what you say is true " there‚Äôs a 95% chance we have a contested election or Biden wins" then why would the market react to that? dont you think they have access to the same polling data you do and have traded accordingly for weeks now?
What do you mean?
it depends on brokerage. for instance, if i sell a CSP on MSFT at 207.50 strike for 3.00 premium, when I get assigned, it shows that I actually bought at 204.50 (it rolls the premium into cost basis). So, if your purchase price for MSFT shows your actual strike price of the put (207.50), then that $300 premium just went into your account (as cash proceeds) but not counted as a P&L because it's not tied to the underlying performance.

make sense? basically, if you now sell MSFT at 204.50, you've broken even (if you include proceeds from the premium). what you *should* do is now sell a CC a couple strikes above where MSFT is.

good luck have fun
I don‚Äôt think they can tell him until the trails are completely done.

Is that a thing? No way they are allowed to do that.
Let‚Äôs just hope this isn‚Äôt another Luckin Coffee, then that stop loss won‚Äôt do shit
Youre missing the big picture. 300,000 plus production line coming and now Chinese gov backing. The stocks going to 100 bucks.
This
lol ath? tmr
Borrow on a credit card to gamble?

Fuck. You're. Dumb.
My last roommate lied to me all the time. I finally up and divorced her ass.
Re-shorted at ES 3365.
What headlines do we expect to see explaining this rally
What price are you going/which calls
I have to admit I am struggling with this last season of Billions too
Trump acting like an adult.  Hmm.
As a WFC shareholder I feel really bad for whomever bought 20,000 24.5 11/20 calls.

You poor dumb bastard.
I was already here
Who is the market expecting to win
Succession obviously
Lmao, I think we would‚Äôve know by now.
I bought calls yesterday morning.  :D I'm a happy man.  Tho... do i get out now or wait till trump tanks the market with his legal case for voter suppression?
Facts
Oooh how do I invest in pre market coke companies. 

Does anyone know a cartel member who will sell me shares?
Fucking tell me about it
Hmm.. DOW up 1,300 points in less than 48 hrs.. seems like a good time for calls? You tell me
Your absolutely right, I‚Äôve been revenge trading off emotion and keep losing everything I put in, I need to chill and relax and only make good trades when I see a time to enter such as if it goes to 350 or if it tanks right now there isn‚Äôt much to play
On the chance that the winner is obvious and can‚Äôt reasonably be disputed, get ready to moon. Removing uncertainty is always good.
BABA 290c seems potentially lucrative  on the 01/15 losing 40% today. A bit pricey for me but would that be a smart play?
Hell yeah, ever heard of the liteboxer? If you love the bike when stoned you‚Äôll love this extra https://www.instagram.com/p/CEzbXJTgkTF/?igshid=1m1e6aqqhzln8
Alright listen up autists. I'm going to tell you exactly how these next few days are gonna go (and yes they conveniently match with my positions). Biden landslide victory announced tonight. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt all disappear. Huge green to end the week particularly weed stocks which will shoot to the moon (think 20%+ weekly gain considering weed will soon be decriminalized and possibly legalized). VIX and VXX will be dead, sorry homies who are holding
always ask myself, why I hedge... and when I don't it fucking dumps... Hedges are such a waste of money
She's on a winning streak.

How could she lose, right?
fuck you
Yeah I‚Äôve been waiting for the pullback since $30, but it just keeps going up. Think it‚Äôll ever go below $30 again? I wanted to buy shares and hold. Maybe leaps. Nothing risky because I think the upside for long term is huge
[removed]
Uncertainty only is good for wallstreetbetters, not the rest of the market. Sorry dude.

Also Bloomberg would have endorsed the mango not Biden then.
Natural selection lol
Just you wait my guy.
I wanna buy puts at the top of the pump but last time a pump took us to $350 üò≥
The silence before the storm.

I know someone who is part of one of the trials. But he doesn‚Äôt know if he got the vaccine or a placebo.

Calling him out for going to parties? Are you his mom lmao

Seeing Selena Gomez wet hair telling people to vote, ran to the closest ballot box to finalize my vote
Not feeling this last season of Billions. Never got into succession.
I think he‚Äôs trying to say this would be a good time to buy a dip
Spy head and shoulders
Who said anything about contested election? Every election, SPY takes a dip. Just trying my luck this time.
Trump r fuk
See you should have shorted instead of going long.
Lmao true
My exes are shortish, but I need to grow if I want to date this new breed of AMZNs
VXX you cunt whore
f*cking bullish
Yes
no idea, my hedges didn't even bleed that much... lol my longs positions are green :D
It‚Äôs alright. When I looked up the date i realized it was to win $100. So doesn‚Äôt really matter. I don‚Äôt want trump to win anything anyways. I should just go dump my balance on other book on Biden since everyone seems to think Biden a lock
Lol, any trade made today is degenerate
[deleted]
286 usd just seems so cheap for BABA coming into christmas times....
giphy was bought for $400mm. . .insane
I bought the dip!
Make him do a pee on a stick pregnancy test, but tell him it‚Äôs a COVID antibody test
the polling places are empty. 80% already voted.. maybe there will be some more traffic in the evening, but by then it will be prime time coverage in the studio. And there isn't anyone trying to scare voters away, that's just made up crap.
AAPL $115 C for Nov 13?
Play underlying shares man, buying options have so much against you. Theta, IV, all other factors it‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôve made more money trading underlying shares than options
Thanks bro. Up %30 now.

IWM puts?
I remember the time where sentiment on this company is "NIO sucks" or something like that.
It's not too late. I'm waiting to get back in. It usually pulls back after a run up. ER is 11/17 so that factors in too but I'm keeping my eye out for a drop. If not there's other EV stocks to play üëçüëç
So you needed to come to social media to tell us that? haha
[deleted]
You see that volume? 93% was me, and I bought one contract for my cat.
[removed]
Calls on sedg? 25% drop today and smart energy sector. Biden wins, it jumps. Thoughts?
What if Trump patiently waits like an adult, and then he wins. There you go, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ r fuk!
If ya‚Äôll still holding calls after this morning ya‚Äôll wild
Nah it‚Äôs humorous
Why not?
I thought you left? No one gives a shit bro
Is the volume on that dildo fr lol 750k?
thanks for the condescension shill. People like you will ensure I never vote on your side
What's the time frame outlook for regulatory response for Ant?  Can the issues be addressed within the next month or two?
Anything under $300 is an easy buy
If I were you I would hold, I am looking at more downside to come. But sell around SPY 310-305 if it gets there.
Sell the news. Always
Keep up the grind my man, be disciplined
My bad for buying the baba dip
Now is a good time to get in. Longs are cheap af. I should know, I‚Äôm down 80% on some of them lmao
Now how is it looking?? Excited for you! Hopefully you get a good gain! :)
If it breaks 270 I'm in
See Elon's tweet on Aug 4 - I wouldn't be so sure
Polling showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide. You'd be a fool to trust the polls. And to think Biden actually stands a chance.
Robots are cheap but child labor is cheaper
no volume
Should have bought Roku dip instead of PTON
we trade flat, possible some upside. :) the play is to condor or strangle. Its like Earnings day for SPY lol
Actually I went from -99% to -94%, suck it nerd
ok, be sure to make your choice known:

Billions or Succession, which is the better tv show?
Just don't revenge trade and try to make it all back in a short amount of time. That often ends up going badly.

I mainly scalp futures so I'm usually in and out of trades within seconds to minutes.

But as for options on the market, planning on puts if SPY gets to around 345. It might get to 355 as well. Will have to see how price reacts at those levels. Hell, it could go to 400 too.

The other plan is to just wait to see if there's a crash and buy calls at key areas. 314 and 300 being the next support areas.
We‚Äôll be back under 3000 soon enough
NIO has to correct now I can‚Äôt handle these gains
Nah Prop 22 will prob pass
[deleted]
You forget the autists who bought calls at the top
Reasonable, balanced thinking? GTFO of this degenerate casino dude
To the tits!
CXW pumping while weed and solar bleedüëÄ
Wtf is happening to stock market did we just save the world? Why is everything so green lol.
Depends if there is a winner
When the only snaps you get are from Team Snapchat üòé
Imagine if we could post gifs in here.

Just imagine the shitposting potential.

Calls on GIF.
How much for your tranny?
how much leverage do you have bro, it's been at 336 for like 4 hours
True, the senate predictions are indicating a fairly even split ([https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/)). A slight Dem majority is within the realm of possibility, though.
Was a shitty day yesterday, spending today trying to get back to my initial amount
Ummm. Lol. Were you here in March?
Won't ANT IPO later in the year, and then long calls on BABA will pay bigly? Especially if it drops down to $250 again.
aight i'm quitting options but I gotta try making up my losses


what if I dump the rest of my available margin into QQQ or smth
[deleted]
Have heard this the past few weeks. Eventually one of you retards will be right
uber puts?
What do I do?
Dunno but it‚Äôs very frustrating
First ones free, see you in 2 months @-99%
Zoom out retard
Problem is they need him to sign off on bills and he won't even if they pass them. Any vetoed bill needs 2/3 majority to over turn, which they won't get. Could be a lot of stalemate again if that scenario plays out.
You‚Äôre right, what‚Äôs 200 more shares going to hurt when you‚Äôre already down 6k playing weeklys.
MMs: DAHMP ET
makes no sense
[deleted]
Would be nice if NIo could pump to 36 so I can get out and watch the chaos from cash gang
this
Set your threshold ahead of time and stick to it. Pick your exit to get out if it goes up and pick how far you‚Äôre willing to go down before you bail.
Imagine wanting a contested election so your two spy puts can print.
0 calories in bong rips
I hear ya believe me, you go numb to 50% returns lol
mine too, such a piece of shit
no lost too much buying tech on the top before ... but it helped me get some of my money back.. lost 90% on an AMZN call before
[deleted]
Kinda looks like they do lol.
Apple news has one
I weirdly doubt we‚Äôll have too much election trouble. Think people might be wore out over political rioting from the last 6 months of different shit and want to move on. We‚Äôll see tomorrow...
check your personal risk tolerance
I think we def taper into close
Price action alert: SPY is forming a classic flaccid dick pattern
ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
atta boy
Yes, do it one hour or more before
I think tonight and tomorrow will be chaotic
[deleted]
Genetics yo
Regardless of the election results, I‚Äôm taking a break from all social media.
Sell so we can finally crash
STFU!
Wtf this spy dump
Bullshit. I'm 6'3, all my exes top out at 5'5. Making out while standing blows when you're like a giraffe trying to pick up something off the ground
Is there any reason not to buy a ton of BABA shares right now?
Eat more tendies
I personally love riding my indoor bike while high
market investor is my favorite flavor of nihilism
Good luck.
dont give up retards

eventually you;ll win once

turn your account from -99% to -98%
Puts on nio, it‚Äôs the top. Nios battery swap system is ridiculous now that fast charging is a thing via tabless battery
Analysts are simultaneously hacks, and also trying to be "responsible", so its their jobs to consider everything in the price. Part of that might be something like "Trump could shut down trade" to "TSLA is a strong competitor and reduced TSLA car prices could compete with NIO" (which was the stated reason).

Ultimately though, true red blooded bulls know none of that shit matters in this market. Stocks go up because people get excited about them. Nobody is sitting around brooding about could, may, and if. They're thinking "this company is spitting fire every single month and I want some." That's what's driving this bull run.
Like if you made money so far today

PLTR with the straight reversal

What way so stocks only go..? Are you fucking new here
Sell OTM calls
[removed]
not even gonna fall for this fake dump. been raped Friday and Monday at close
Lol i was thinking the same. They are going to dump this shit
GameStop isn‚Äôt a long term smart choice, closed like 500 stores in 2 years alone, pretty sure soon they‚Äôll be bankrupt
[deleted]
I love Nio stock, but imo it should‚Äôve been a bit longer to see this jump. But I believe it‚Äôs going up, but I got puts on Li auto for sure.
I was going to buy more NIO on the dip, but there has been no dip. Should I just load up at this price? Hmmm
Best place to track live election results? Counting etc
no, it's multi-tasking which is very productive
I‚Äôd suck a duck for aapl to go red so I could get more calls
Loaded up on long calls after seeing bond movements. Don‚Äôt just look at equities
Bye bye BABA
BUY THEM NOW RETARD.
My theory for this afternoon's action is that buy-side pressure will disappear (why buy the afternoon before the election?) and normal, or slightly higher, sell action will push the indexes lower. Disclosure: I bought QQQ puts this morning.
Wtf is nios volume rn
I don't buy my guns I build them so id always advise against this play :p

Still, the climate ain't right either like you said.
Election coverage is so boring. If you want ratings, just forget election analysis and other commentaries. Just put cameras at polling places in swing states, and find idiots dressed in military uniforms with guns trying to scare voters away. Just broadcast that all day and it will be ratings gold
I think you could argue that it‚Äôs just the market moving up to the moving averages
NIO is a fucking godsend
When did girls get so tall?

Everyone out here clearing 5'9" easy
Nice

Dollar bid, metals bid, people not so sure about the election anymore.
none of us are going to be walking right, after this nonsense...
Whats the play eod
People aren‚Äôt holding through the election???
If everyone owns OLEDs, QLEDs, etc., why do fucking stupid ass networks insist on putting a dumbass fixed logo in one of the corners of the screen that never moves?  We all know it can burn in images into a screen.  Stop doing that shit.
Even if Mango wins, the house and senate will likely be blue which is big for all clean tech companies. Better buy now. $NIO $HYLN
ok SPY dump now trash set a stop limit.
Down 40%
RemindME!  2 days
Gayme Stop üåà

Is it counterproductive if I smoke my bong while riding my fake Amazon Peloton?

Awesome day, took a shitload of profit, about 30% cash now, rest of my positions looking good for a swing tmr.  LFG.
Let‚Äôs go make it back my friend
me too down 5k
Why SPY is slowing dropping?
Papa Trump is not gonna win?
NLS is the new PTON
Should have bought more at 18 :-(
please let this be true
I‚Äôm in
Doordash ads are so fucking dumb when 95% of their orders are Chinese or Burgers
T212 down again? Did the entire UK population just made accounts and now pump the shit outta the market?
You‚Äôre right. I was pretty high on nio back then too. Just wish I would‚Äôve stuck with it. Damn. It hurts knowing I was that close and it was that easy
Today could be a good time to get in. But it could also go extremely sour if the election swings the other way. Really just gambling if you buy in now.
Glad you didn‚Äôt say heart. Scientists are still studying the black hole where that‚Äôs supposed to be.
Im gonna vote today. Wait, i‚Äôm not even american ü§°
BOMBS AWAY!!!
Making money bro! That‚Äôs all that matters
Sell half at 25% up, one quarter at 40% up and the last quarter is up to you depending on your risk tolerance, let it ride or close out
Alright time travelers tell us what happens to spy tomorrow.
sold SNE calls for $400 when today it would have been $3000 profit 

The next move awaits, til we break ofc
Nice. I was thinking ITM spreads for January but yea I‚Äôm not touching anything that I‚Äôm holding until after tomorrow.
I think it bounces between $35-$40 till January.
Imagine what will happen to the states like Kentucky/ Alabama who require federal assistance to operate under normal non-covid circumstances. Puts on the south
VXX truly worthless piece of shit
VXX calls?
[removed]
So yolo Healthcare ETFs?  FHLC for the win! ü§£ü§£ü§£
I think we end red, just my completely unprofessional and biased opinion
Bought the dip on SEDG today.
SPY dropping and VXX just broken
Oof, that‚Äôs not great odds. He has a much better chance of losing the pop vote and winning the electoral college. Hard to imagine him winning the pop vote, sorry brother.
Profit is profit man. It could've went 30% the other way. Nobody really knows.
No way china govt will let nio sink
Short from 3378 ([post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jn7ua1/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_03_2020/gb0md1j/)) looking good, covered 1 at 3362, letting rest ride  and hoping for below 3355 and then 3348, then it can really waterfall.
Yes it is part of Tippie
I didnt. You ruined christmas for me.
Bears literally had a fake depression in march.
Looks like a blood bath incoming tomorrow with all these fake pumps the past few days
I am being absolutely raped on the baba calls I bought
Crazy shit likely happens tonight and tomorrow
Worried about the IV crush tonight. Staying out of options and looking for LEAPs on Wednesday to play
ü•≠ is going to log off his Yahoo Messager for maybe the last time.

Short yahoo.
i usually clock out at 50% gains and reinvest. Going to wait for that nice red river of death to come any day like it did before.
IAU
Sir we are autists here, this is full retard
Got many moneys too?
I‚Äôm already out
Got up 340% on some SQQQ last week. Ended up selling at +250%. Hard to sell +40% (or 75%) when you get that thought of +300%
Move over tsla, nio is the one.
[deleted]
Wait to enter BABA, gonna touch 270...maybe
How about we start now?
Alibaba and the 40 **~~Thieves~~** percent loss almost immediately.
I'm going to buy puts eod. Who's with me?
Why not? That would squeeze all the max leveraged bulls who are expecting a post election rally. Seems like thats the crowded trade rn
[deleted]
What kind of IV compression are we expecting overnight on SPY/QQQ options, specifically 11/6's or 11/13's

i think they are mid 50's right now.
lol
the market is not always trending up, see feb 20th to march 20th that is literally a downward trend
[removed]
Sometimes the smartest play is not to make one
Get in again M8. It's never too late
ER might hit it differently. You never know.
why is vxx dumping with spy
He did but the house has control of finances. You think Nancy wants to give trump what he wants?
Handys from yo mama
No way MM let nio end week above 35, if u check volume 35c expiring friday
anyone playing $NET earnings?
If the rest of the election goes off as it is now (no crazy shit) what are you doing EOD? I'm really thinking NIO, SPY, and maaaaaaaaaaybe APHA calls.

I wish I just stopped after breaking even every day. -30K to +300 to -30K again.
WeWork redux?
i have one month promo on the card meaning that if i dont pay balance back in full, i have start paying 14.99% APR after promo expires, hence my $93 11/20 lotto expiration date.
Maybe my thinking is wrong, but here it goes...

Trump wins- economy opens up quicker and more oil is needed

Biden wins- tries to ban fracking, small companies go out business, large companies have layoffs, and oil production is cut thus driving up the price of a barrel of oil
Smarter than most.
And in the world
If spy goes to 320 by Friday than I‚Äôll zelle you
best thing I ever did was starting to inverse WSB ... had so much calls for today
üòé
Cash
Toys r Us going bankrupt really hurt Mattel and the gaming industry took notice.
no
/VX are VIX futures. Same way /ES are SPX futures
how do you buy those two stocks? Td ameritrade and chase investing doesn't allow it
Depends how many people got out of puts and into calls so far today
Puts on snap. Didn‚Äôt go up during that rise this morning. Going to fall today
As hard as your flaccid cock.
Most elections seem to tank the market right after. Remember the trump market panic of 2016?
Wait what the hell is a singles day? Ok : Just googled it. I am sorry about wasting bandwidth asking stupid questions.
Well if you go all in TSLA calls, you should already be up 10 folds. I know it because I sold calls
There is no scenario where Baba goes up on the back of this news. Maybe on some other news, but this news is all bad.
Still scared money smh...
Man, HYLN with that big dick energy. Never thought I would be saying that.
Then reply to emails lazy ass

This is the old version of selling your lambo

Fair enough. Didn‚Äôt know yahoo finance had a live show but would make sense if there‚Äôs no order to any of the list.
Credit card cash advance?
3k orders of Wendy's $15 11/20 puts. $WEN is at $22.60 and hasn't seen $15 since April. I'm in.

Gamestop autists managed to use online order numbers to track order flow. They're on track for a huge online Q3.
Might be at 41 by then.
The volume we see the last 5 minutes of the trading day is going to be wild
Assuming you're not joking, no IV crush will happen either way after the event that was spiking IV is over... like earnings or in this case an election.
This is the problem with puts. The market is always trending up. You could be totally right about a 10% drop coming soon. But it goes up 10% first so your puts still don't print.
NIO is the new PTON which was the new TSLA
Ya, they are going to take our guns and rape our wives. I heard that one back in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016.. yet my house is not burned down, I still have my guns, my wife remains un raped and I still have to pay a shit ton of taxes so people in middle america can sit around waiting for factory jobs to come back while smoking meth.
Yeah, pretty bitter about it.
Cucked by CCP
it broke
Your vote only counts if you post a selfie with the sticker on social media.

And I'll spend their tendies at Wendy's
Honestly what do you guys think NIO hits eoy
At least 336.49 am I right?
I truly hope that‚Äôs not the case
gross, good luck
Every time i get an email that says per my email yesterday i want to reach through the screen and choke the person
We must settle for 30% returns. That‚Äôs my price point from now on. Greed only kills returns
VIX üëÄ
Let the stimulus begin
Please. It could have easily gone red today too.
Of average trading volume
Decide to be bicurious and turn into a gay bear last Friday for once and down 1500 (40%) on all my bearish positions (SQQQ, VXX). Fuck this shit.
left that strike behind so damn quick as if it didn‚Äôt want to be associated with it

The market is not goin to tank bro why are u all wishing for a crash
Yeah I'm already up and out for way more than I initially put in, with plenty leftover. I'll see how tomorrow fares after the ballot initiatives are concrete and sell.
Next red day might be $42 -> $40
Of course it‚Äôs true? One person buys and another sells- it‚Äôs a zero sum gain at all times.

It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock and roll.
I‚Äôm so sad that I sold my nio calls for a 30% profit. Would‚Äôve been a 2 bagger by now. Fuck me dude
Sir.. if my margin call gets cleared soon.... I'm in. Calls. All the calls. And if this prints me a 3 bagger. You can fly to Arkansas and ill give you the roughest hand job you've ever had. Ill use rem oil, gun powder and maybe even give you a Beretta bite.
I probably would bro but I legit have nothing left
You sure aren‚Äôt selling it well as an act. Anyways, calm down, shits basically over by the end of the day
Raise your hand if you had calls at the top and puts at the bottom. ‚úã‚úã
Yeah im feeling pretty strong ab a Biden win (not partisan, based on polling etc). I‚Äôm wondering if now is the time to get into the stuff that would perform well with Biden before it becomes more certain. I would buy in to clean energy and a few other things slowly. I have about 1k USD
holding on qqq 300c mar exp but this baba dip seems to good, to sell or not to sell for baba 300c
Exactly my point. Ammo and guns are back ordered  until April at the earliest
Sold my calls and switched to puts. Wish me luck
Republican senate == no states bailout. 

MTA about to be in shambles. CA is fucked.
take the emotion out.  set a defined limit for selling, or once you are up, set trailing stop losses.  use of conditional sell orders is the one part everyone ignores, but mastery of it can dramatically increase your gains.
Y?
If you are looking to make $100 and you do, take the $100 off the table. If you are looking for $1,000 and you make that $1,000, take that off the table. Rinse/Repeat.

If I feel the stock still has some movement in it. I take my profits and look for a reentry. Now I have a new set of downs to work with.
just buy one more from me. I want a new car

Yeah, discipline in my struggle. 20% is an amazing return but you start going numb when your double or even triple returns. It‚Äôs a vicious game

I want to see them back at $80 soon
how hard do we crash the rest of the day?
Yeah man

I think they meant the order of the list.  i.e. how is the order of the list determined.
The only thing that got us to that was the stimulus check. 2018 was a dip. 2019 originally dipped until announced a stimulus which spiked the market. That's no different than  when obama bailed out the market during the 2008 crash.
Around 10pm MST we have a decent idea of who is going to win, and by tomorrow morning we'll be pretty clear.

At least that's how normal elections work. Whatever gets called in the next 24 hours will be contested through Thanksgiving because mail in ballots
all good g. PYPL got my lunch covered today
We‚Äôre hard to kill.
Never when i bought my hundreds on the dollar SPY poots did I think seeing it dip below 2% today would be a victory lmao
I think I‚Äôm just never buying puts again
F ouuta here
Put to Call Ratio 1.12 LMFAO
Puts are melting faster than the polar ice caps
Now that most people dumped their puts its time to bleed down.
I know exactly how this feels! I went from 60k to 30k and had to scrap my way back to 60k! Keep going strong!

Now why would an expert businessman who deals with the CCP on a daily basis make these comments. smh.

But a grt opportunity to buy the dip. Chinese regulators will jerk him around a bit and declare supremacy but cannot afford to really stop it altogether. this is one of their national champions

Have you guys thought inversing your own trades or idk risk management? Fuck I thought my -$20 day was bad
[deleted]
I feel like you have too much fair in journalism as a whole
either set a price target (e.g., 50% profit) or let it run until price action reverses direction and use a trailing stop-loss. If underlying is at ATH, be greedy and hold longer than anticipated
Took a little profit from ACB, bought a few week out BABA calls. Many regerts

Man when you‚Äôve played the game as long as I have you start to learn stuff, like have I made money? no... but have I had fun along the way? Also no
Looks like everyone moved on lmao.
Ya assuming Trump becomes even more of a wildcard in his hypothetical second term he‚Äôs probably more likely to legalize then a trad  dem like Joe. 

This is just going off the thing that Trump jr posted on his gram tho lmao.

Reducing position size as the returns start decelerating is the proper way, but some people need to be slapped with losses for months before it actually sinks in.

He doesn't have to legitimately contest. He can say "The whole thing is rigged and they won't let me contest!" and a whole lot of people will believe him. What they do next is uncertain, but a lot of them like to march around with guns and pretend to be an army. It's a little worrisome to some people.
Baba gonna give a second chance at that sweet morning dip?
If it drops you buying more?

Well for every trade there‚Äôs a winner and a loser. It‚Äôs just that a small percentage of the players win the vast majority of the trades.
Yeah that‚Äôs right. They also won‚Äôt stop you from executing number 4, but at that point you have the 90 day ban/PTD classification.
Great plays. The only thing I'd change is apple. It's neutral normally up and down throughout november and December (dipping in January after reports). You'll probably see at most 3% up and down per week.
Don't get me wrong, more power to any of you who made money off of NIO or BABA or any other Chinese companies, but if any of yall retards are still surprised that this is happening, you deserve to lose money if you did. This is why, as appealing as any Chinese companies seems, I personally don't touch them since the government can literally fuck you in the ass anytime.

This shit happened cause Ma said some non PC stuff regarding the country, if you piss off the govt in anyway, you will burn for it, any of the big companies in china needs approval from the govt to be successful in any major form, and they can take that opportunity from you just as quickly as when they first gave it to you.

Good luck guys.
If the incumbent holds office, what happens to NIO?
Did you ask, nicely?
Can Nio go back to 35. Wtf is this

Haha it‚Äôs not very WSB of me but this is just from investing when it was at $11. Don‚Äôt trade options...yet

What the fuck that's the only reason I went.
Sad... don‚Äôt give up man
3 every rolling 5 day period.
Yeah in december
My mind says BABA monthlies but my mind says weeklies
Before you enter a trade, set levels where you will take profit or take a loss and follow your levels when they hit. I tend to cut a losing trade all at once but scale out of winners. I set two or three levels to cut 20-30% of a position and let the last 10-20% ride. Sometimes I‚Äôll rebuy on dips if I like the stock.
Congrats, I sold at the first spike. I should‚Äôve held an hour longer but I‚Äôm a pussy. So I bought puts like a retard. Obviously NIO only goes up. Or I should‚Äôve bought $35p.

According to NatGeo:
‚ÄúUnder federal law, states would have to follow a uniform process to deliver their electoral votes to Congress by late December. The timeline was intentionally created to give states time to deal with electoral disputes without allowing it to drag on indefinitely. States have until six days before the winning electors meet to resolve any issues. In 2020, this ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù deadline‚Äîso named because it guarantees that a state‚Äôs resolution of outstanding issues will be accepted by Congress‚Äîis December 8.‚Äù
Bought nio leaps at $25 a share. Sold a week later for a 30% gain. If I held it would‚Äôve been over 150% gain by now ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

Good trade idea, I'll watch it
Or will go through but with CCP now owning half of it.

Lmao okay buuuuudddyyy
I know I‚Äôm dumb but please help me

I looked at the odds for Senate races doesnt look like the Dems will be flipping enough to get a majority, Dems will countrol the House and Biden is favourite to win

Knowing the Chinese, they'll find a way to seize the company and have him replaced with someone willing to toe the party line instead of outright destroying the company. If they outright fucked over one of the single largest Chinese companies in existence it would destroy international trust and investment in Chinese firms for a long time to come. They aren't that stupid. They'll find a way to make Ma bend to their will, or they'll hand the company over to someone else. Then the IPO will move forward.
I guess the wind stopped blowing?
True. But they have an enormous first mover advantage, they‚Äôve become a verb stock (Netflix n chill, google, zoom. This has crazy marketing power) they only do streaming instead of being partially in parks (Disney), they don‚Äôt have any conflicts of interest with their IP being tied to a partner cable network (Disney again), huge network effect, extraordinary original content spend, massive international growth, ability to raise prices significantly without losing many subscribers over time, & this is all without ads which is the prime money maker for the content creation world
Did you get slaughtered in the September massacre as well?

stimulus isn't money printing.  They take money from the rich in exchange for bonds.  They then take that money and spend it on dumbass shit.  Stimulus is just another way to rearrange the money supply

Funny they would write this article when at the same time they are loading up on ass loads of 30 year bonds.  Commercial banks have something like 4 trillion dollars in bonds between all of them.  Here's a question for everyone:  What happens to equities when bonds go up?  Goldman sachs also wrote an article saying that gold was going to skyrocket past 3k when it was hot.  At the same time they've been buying every bond in sight since 2016, a bet on deflation if anything because lower yields means lending conditions will probably tighten, hence less borrowing.  These guys aren't your friend, and imo no one should ever take their advice.

Market pricing in a government trifecta (big red wave or big blue wave). If one party controls the house, senate and presidency in an environment with zero inflation pressure, they could moon the economy and stock market.
i would feel like a broke fuck cuz I can only afford three
That‚Äôs absolutely not true at all. It is not 50%. If that were the case there would be a lot more winners out there.
I'm sad that they knocked down the leverage, but man it got absolutely destroyed that fateful day GDX and GDXJ had like a -20% or -25% day followed up by another massive drop. Now First Majestic has about the same IV as GDX. It'll cycle back to popularity if gold drops back to $1,700 to climb again or hits $2,000, though both could be a ways out.

Biggest IV crush is expected after election. Let me elaborate. There is going to be a clear winner tonight and either parties are going to be poise about it. Sure, there will be unrest here and there but democracy is in play. You had the chance to vote, whomever is chosen just suck it up. Amen

I could not agree with you more to be honest, your right and smart about sitting it out for now. Right now I have no clue which way but after election this should get interesting. I need to get my overall back lol need so make smart plays soon, what are you thinking for your next potential play

The issue is the Chinese govt is retaliating against jack ma after he criticized the govt. I think they might shut down the ipo for longer or not let it go through
Literally everything is Green today are U stupid?
yes

I think this makes you a stable genius

Maybe buying dat paypal dip wasnt such a bad idea....
Jack Ma is probably one of the most powerful people in a China right now. The government isn‚Äôt just going to ‚Äúpause‚Äù this IPO and wait for additional disclosure. My money is on it being cancelled. 

You can‚Äôt see the stuff Chinese media has been posting about Jack Ma. Not been pretty.
Haven‚Äôt tried that yet I‚Äôm a complete noob. Played echo vr and had my mind blown flying around having people in there teach me how to play it was surreal.

How do I know winter is here? When my internet stops working all of a sudden. Fucking xfinity only works properly during the summer.
The key issues here are 

\- Buy PUTs

\- The IPO is cancelled, money being returned to investors. 

\- ANT have to use 30% of their own money for originating loans. Previously the requirement was 2%. 

\- They already have 2T Yuan in loans outstanding which means they need 700b Yuan to cover them. That's USD$45 Billion required, when the IPO was only due to raise $25. 

\- Ant is no longer worth $300B, not even close. 

\- Baba own 30% of Ant Financial and was running on the back of "World's biggest IPO".

What type of answer is this. Take that bullshit back to r/stocks

Who is staying up tonight? I got my snacks and energy drinks ready.
Spy train was 2 days ago. It‚Äôs just now back to where it‚Äôs been. I think right now allot people are hyped on NIO at the moment. My suggestion is to go Tesla 2022 Jan 1k call. That play has allot open volume still and interest. If you got in on Monday that call was around 2k it‚Äôs already back to 3k. 
If you ply nio Idk I just suggest to buy shares. My opinion. The short term lotto plays have popped. But there is allot hype so I think the bulls will push nio to 100$ by x mas maybe. Idk that optimistic 

Right now my positions are 85$ amd call nov 20th nothing but loss. Bought at the top and bag held 

Apple 120$ call 6/18/2021 this is little more of a conservative play. 

I got SPY Jan 2021 400$ call bought at the top bag held my whole position. 

And I think I have a QQQ put retarded play all together almost made 9$ on it yesterday decided to bag hold. 

I just also want to say. I love you guys. All you autist and bag holders out there.
Hmmm I‚Äôm gonna check your info out. Thx for the input
30% loss is better than 100%
Insider polls say yes
Where you been?
Sir, this is a comic book.
Probably a good idea to stop trading OTM weeklies. Unless you're using charts to pinpoint entries, it's a sucker's game. 

I don't know, maybe only buy calls on big drops. Even the fastest drop in market history was followed up by the fastest recovery in market history. The market goes up like 80% of the time.

If the market is going to crash, I think we'll see at least mid 340s first. But I don't know, once the election is over, there will be less uncertainty.

Personally, I'm sitting out until I see how the market reacts.

It does seem, that everyone has front run tomorrow Biden win, hence the 2 day small rally, expecting a mega green tomorrow, as in 2016. Perhaps it really is going to be different this time around, red tomorrow, due to some vote counting "issues", for example, and then greenish Thursday-Friday. Or maybe it really will be really that simple and obvious, Biden wins, SPY 360 by Friday, or something like that.

This is solid advice. Surprising for this sub

EDIT - jambi - just google "covered calls".

You're really far in the money on NIO.  You might as well generate some cash out of it.  Your risk on selling the call options is contained because you own NIO.

Buying puts just means that if NIO tanks then your puts offsets whatever loss NIO takes.  The example that Erik gave is solid.

Godspeed Autist and a heartfelt congratulations
Grats to people holding NIO. Lowkey thought that shit wasn't worth it back in July. Feeling FOMO for some 2023 OTM calls
If that's a short squeeze abandon hope for all who travel there

Trump can‚Äôt just contest - there are strict guidelines to contest and you have to go through county to county to determine that. Doubt that will happen.
I got NIO leaps $25c for 01/15/2023, had 8 and sold 6 for 80% return in 2 weeks, now I sit with two and hope they can take me to promised land. Might have to load up some more stocks, only got 100
The sell off was last week
I'm still upset with Trump because of the day I went all in on JDST back when it was 3x during a quiet week and 30 minutes later he tweeted "I am the Tariff Man!", causing gold to spike and taking 15% off my portfolio.
Pointless comment, because you know no one is
Sounds fire! Hope you get to enjoy some!
Why work for the company of you can own part of it... im talking about buying a share.
I agree, and this election will most likely get close to 150m votes which is good for dems. The problem for GOP is that they need a huge wave of support to be showing up at the polls right this minute to catch up to dems early vote, making long lines a soothing sight for GOP

Oddsmakers have R party for popular vote at around 10%. Honestly even if Trump wins I think the pop vote goes to D =>99%. Either way 4 to 1 is a terrible payoff for that bet.

TWNK December calls. Earnings on Thursday. Lot of open interest
Pretty sure trumps turnout was very very high historically. The problem was everyone was indolent and expected a victory for Clinton due to bad polling methodology. Which is that happened this time. That alone makes everything up in the air low key

Naw still early for the company. China is going to be the world‚Äôs biggest EV market. Nio is a Chinese company backed by the Chinese government. They will want them to succeed over the American competitors, mainly Tesla. Tesla is currently 10x the value of Nio. Plenty of room for Nio to grow and possibly surpass Tesla in the future

Shockingly, the economic theory that is based on sound money and anti-govt intervention in the markets has been cast aside by the people who want to inflate the currency and intervene in the economy.
Reeee
Yes I've talked to buddies that still work there and they have been going gang busters since corona hit. They started giving the workers 1.75 OT rate as opposed to 1.5
At least pick a reasonable strike if you're going to bet either way. These SPY 270p or 360c plays are just fucking dumb unless you're setting expiry at like 3 months.
QQQ up 1/3 of a point since RH couldn't get my bid in, awesome.
anyone got any cheat codes? been trying to beat this game for over a year but cant win
That is a terrible bet. Trump's money line was only like +150 to +175 and he has to win FL, PA and then some combination of MI, AZ, WI. It is at a minimum a 3 state parlay where he is the underdog in all of them if you believe the polls are at all accurate. Even if you think they are wrong or it is a toss up you are looking at much longer odds than +150.

You've never seen a 2% day? When did you start trading?
That's not an argument, that's an unsupported conclusion. And it's false, just fyi.

So flesh it out a bit -- explain how a monetary system with a fixed currency that disallows monetary stimulus during a recession or depression is advantageous to a system that allows increasing monetary flow via loans to banks.

No one buys Lambo calls
VWAP holds...look at that. confirming now
No sail extension means they stay in low power mode until it actually makes sense to burn cash on preparing the fleet to sail. It is logical that the stock goes up on this news.
Highly recommend you guys get into the GME short squeeze before it really hits the fan
Strike?
my biggest confusion is why we were dropping at all. I guess covid reaching ath but that just means we get more money no matter who is in office.
The level of retardation on Investing.com comments has nothing on us
Holding puts til end of day. I‚Äôd be happy to maintain a 50% loss at this point but hoping for a dump
If you have $5 million to bet like this, you probably do it more to be able to say you did it. Winning probably doesn't matter to him.

BuildAWall Trump been priced in since yesterday
Oof
Poor boys stand down
My strategy is usually to go against the crowd, I go based off speculation and news and rationality which clearly isn‚Äôt working, I‚Äôve been mainly trading spy and I played Facebook earnings and got fucking raped, I mainly play spy tbh
OK have to ask now.. Sold the $37 calls after the run up yesterday but getting ass blasted today lol. How do you manage such positions where it has run up so much that it's more expensive to buy back than the premium you made? It's Jan dated so I could wait for it to fall
Now change the guy to little pimp
What were your positions?
This ^
good job waiting until VIX was down 6%.
man NIO puts are really cheap atm
I know I'm just going to watch it and cry

When you sell your CCs, take 10% of the premium and buy a weekly call ATM....you'll feel less sad no matter how things shake out.

Also, RSI on JPM is through the roof right now, it's coming back down in the next week or so, but maybe not by Friday to save your CC. Regardless, just buy back in or sell a CSP when RSI is low again. Rinse and repeat.
9k in GEO calls. If it does the same as 2016, I will make 200k+

It's pretty easy
People HATED Clinton
There wasn't a huge Rep turnout more of low Dem turnout
Trump won independents
Trump won by razor thin margins in MI/WI/PA
Comey emails really screwed Clinton 

2020
Now lots of people HATE trump
Huge voter turnout which generally" supports D
Biden is winning over independents and doing much better with Seniors
The Hunter Biden story isn't sticking
Biden is setup much better in states Clinton didn't win (GA AZ MI WI PA)

Biden is rightfully the favorite but crazy shit can happen. Trump didn't win the election in 2016 as more as Clinton lost it with low turnout (everyone thought she was going to cruise), many more undecideds on election day and independents tilting towards Trump.

Agree with this analysis. Then it just comes down to how the market will react to stimulus + whichever pres. wins.

I actually see the market tanking in a Trump win. I think wall street has recently realized he's only using them and that the volatility and uncertainty isn't worth it even tho he gets on twitter to hype up JPOW.
i just want to puke about this week in general.

Good luck! Mine are already up 40% and the election could easily push our plays into much higher returns
What will you all hold through tomorrow for election?
I bought a 334 spy put at  3355. Worst trade of my life. I never try to call tops like that but my portfolio has been flat for a couple weeks and emotions got the best of me
Probably once the outcome of today is resolved
Decent entry this morning. I like the 6 month chart. Bought some 30c for March 2021. Looking at it, I think this is pretty undervalued at 2 billion market cap considering the valuations of other EV plays right now. Once more start to catch on, I could see this doubling into the end of the year possibly. I‚Äôll take the ride. Options volume not great, but safe with longer dates I think. Made out like a bandit on NIO (still holding some 20c leaps), and this looks similarly positioned in the scooter/moped field.
You, like me are betting on a contested election.

Dude, meme price theory is real with Tesla.
Isn't that just alphabet?
Data shows Joe has an excellent chance of winning. Markets follow the data. Safe to assume market is pricing Joe winning right now.
"the only reason it's Biden" Josh got stuck in a loop lol

I'm guessing it will go up this week because there will be a lot of volatility.

You got 73% left, plenty to make a comeback. I was 60% down all time and now slightly up. You got this!

Just got back from the polls. Note - Am in PA. Was it a mess for anyone else? I asked the woman why it took so long. She said that literally hundreds of people got the mail-in ballots and then ripped them up and came in anyways, so they had to get a provisional ballot. Those wont be counted for a week apparently, and that was a ton of people all across the state. This could be a wild ride

No, their product is not real. They claim a 30% efficiency increase with their hybrid solution, yet not a single third party (customer) could verify that claim, with some even saying it's outright impossible.

So you don't see any potential for exponential growth in this stock once covid is over and everyone is back on cruise lines???
I think 45 days gives you time for your play to materialize.  For instance those who sells weeklies last week wouldn‚Äôt be able to recover but if they had longer expiry,  this week would have give them an opportunity to exit with profits

I used to work at their ammo plant. All I can say is when Obama was in office for 8 years we worked 60-80 hours a week. We had guys making $30+/hr just sitting at tables hand packaging the boxes of rounds as all the automated packing machines were running full capacity.

Then trump won and we laid off like 20% of the work force and cut hours back and inventory went through the roof because we couldn't sell it fast enough. Look at vsto stock price 2015-2016 then look at 2017 as trump takes office
Pretty sure the hod for SPY has been printed... Holding a small position in some $336P bought at $3.80 when it printed $338s but not expecting anything crazy think maybe spy can test $335 before a bounce into close > have a 20% stop in this and will gladly take a 50% gain if I get it
So cramer talked about nio. Is that what caused this back to back gain
I got a 340 and a 341 spread. Best of luck to you
Just curious how do I find this out?
its  inevitable
dollar going down is bullish for companies, since inflation = more revenue.

So it's first down again, Michael VIX back in the shotgun and he looks over towards the sideline for the signal. Man in motion to his left, and here's the snap, VIX steps up in the pocket. He's looking, looking, moves to his left and he's looking deep, and he checks it down and completes a pass for a short pickup.

Itellya, they really expected to be able to get some deep looks for VIX today, and he's been looking for them but they've been well defended
Back to pavilion
He is the one
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Hopefully Donnie doesn‚Äôt kamikazee the economy when he loses.

If congress and presidency go blue, Donnie will need to be a good boy and keep the trendies flowing so Biden goes easy on him in court maybe.

If Biden wins and Congress is red, bulls mayb fuk.

If Trump wins and Congress is blue - bulls mayb fuk

If Trump sweeps congress and presidency, bears are kill.

It's like if someone asks for money and you give them a giraffe. A giraffe is a different thing.

Also Ron Paul is a known national clown and racist. He's the guy who hired a blimp that ran out of money for his campaign. He's the guy who let his campaign manager die with millions of hospital debt after the guy raised millions for Paul. The racist guy who ran tasteless ads claiming that MLK, who did in fact not like racists, would support him. The guy who doesn't understand or believe in evolution.

Never playing VXX again
Floridas rules require the sec of state to get results within 30 min of polls closing regardless of whether or not theyre finished tabulating. My point is just that whatever gets first reported wont be final. And in an election this heated and contested your damn sure to see it all go to the courts before anythings set in stone.
There‚Äôs only one rule.  Never mess with a Sicilian when death is on the line!

AAL is so dumb smh just go up to 15
Username checks out.
Bought 100x SPX 11/09 3415C yesterday. Sold today for a gain of $104k. Could have held longer for a gain of nearly $300k. Normally I'm good about reminding myself "gains are gains, get up and get out" when I make a short-term YOLO. But damn, that woulda been epic. 

Now need to not trade anything for a few days. I have a bad habit of chasing winners and losing it all.
Nio on a moon mission
I don't feel secure at all if I see a $1,000 jump, need to see like $4,000 to make sure I won't dip into red later in the day. Leverage is helluva thing
Would be funny if all indices closed near 0%.
Sold some OTM December calls so kind of?
No more plays for today. Nothing looks good. Unless AAPL dips hard
If I have reason to believe there will be a 54% spike, even if only for a second, I'm taking out a massive loan. Remortgage the house sized loan. Student debt sized loan. Yolo to end all yolos

Because last week was the biggest red week we've had since March so some decent green days is to be expected regardless of the election.
At first I thought I would never go to the moon. Papa Elon was seeing red and his electro mobile made me sad as its share price looked beyond the reach of a poor mortal. But then I listened to Morpheus, took the red pill and realised Nio was indeed the One. Nio had emerged from the matrix to take us to the moon and beyond. Ever look back. Stonks only go up. Electric car go brrrrr

Hey real talk, with this much cash at stake consider selling as far out of the money covered calls as you can with early expiry to buy protective puts at your initial price with late expiry, something like this:

https://imgur.com/a/6ysAFlL

I took a guess on around how many shares you own so adjust contract numbers accordingly - 1 contract = 100 shares, but basically you'd pay 8k and take the risk that for the next month you'd have to forfeit any gains past $45 if it makes it there, but you'd completely protect your investment from loss for over a year.

Do it again with just the call side and take the risk of capping your gains for another month and you've completely paid for your insurance and have effectively a 0 risk position with unlimited upside for the next ~400 days, and you'll be protected if they gap down big past your trailing stop or end up being completely fraudulent, because, ya know, china.

I know WSB is all yolo's and FDs, but this is real money my mans, enjoy the big win and don't lose it!

Looking for fade to vwap, shit popped off this morning, all ATRs blown up, can it actually just go higher on no news?
HYLN! need you to go up another... does math 100%
I bought 11/13 40c NIO with some spare cash and it doubled. Had I used the rest of my money to buy that I'd be up hugely right now.

Still, I'm up 34% today.
Yes
It took me months and I finally get a reward and it's related to  my PNUS position.

I guess beggars can't be choosers...

How‚Äôll the market be taken by surprise. U tell me
Remember to buy a flock of sheep as well.
Can someone link that long bear thesis from last week ?
Ah someone in general thread just pointed out new Zealand is 12 hours ahead of us so the MMs mist have called then to get the results. Mystery solved.
I would get some pots and pans and bang em outside. Riot the shit out of it.
Yeah but market share.. and purchasing power.. not to mention manufacturing capacity
Plus it‚Äôs backed by the Chinese gov‚Äôt
Glad to dump my SPY puts for $7 loss (taken by E*TRADE for executing my trades üò§)
But what if the drop last week was fake and gay?
im here in philly and people are spouting bullshit like we‚Äôre preparing for civil war because businesses are being boarded up in center city. did you see the eagles super bowl parade? no election can top the chaos of that lmao. anyways spy 420 1/21
This is as valid as any trading system out there.  If you're consistently losing, Invert.

About to take a nap idk if I should absorb some random knowledge on YouTube or listen to Revolver by the Beatles for the millionth time.
One of the reasons ANT IPO was suspended is because of small loans. Chinese government thinks people taking small loans to invest or pay mortgage will threaten the financial stability of the country.

waiting until at least thursday or friday to get something back on them
I‚Äôve been watching NIO closely and have two calls on them. Still new to options and shorter term trading. Could you explain what you‚Äôre seeing? I would appreciate the input.
Wait you got insider info? Asking for a friend.
Nio, I don‚Äôt want my covered calls assigned please don‚Äôt break $40 this week

Thanks! It has so far!  Up about 7k so far.  If we bounce back to 14/15 by EOW next week, I'm going to buy a Tesla haha
Been holding shares, solid lil guy
Let's take a look at this passing game, they've been trying to get some open looks for Michael VIX with playaction but they haven't gotten the defense to bite, the coaches said they wanted to test them with some deep shots here and so far those throws just haven't been open for VIX
bought too early today
We can make a comeback here. I feel it.
source?
I‚Äôm not opposed just in disbelief!
GME gang lets get it!
When my trading account jumps by $1000, I feel nothing...

When I use a $10 coupon on an Amazon purchase, "***holy fuck that was a steal!***"
Why this looks like legit TA DD.
At least he could lose his majority tho.
Here's hoping
You didn't hear? No stimulus check till next year, rising covid cases, nationwide lockdowns and the most controversial election to date. Bigly green
Yeah apparently I don't know how VXX works.
Brother you are ok, keep fighting on. I bet on volatility today and now my living situation is going to be volatile. I guess we just don‚Äôt care about a contested election
Little blankets on my feet..socks.
I bought NIO 35c leaps when it was at $25 (a week ago) and ITM already....wtf
So the put/call ratio on VIX is 1.9 (higher puts purchases) and it is .45 on VXX/UVXY (higher calls).  VIX buyers tend to be ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù money where as VXX/UVXY is more often used by RH traders.
Exactly these guys are too into old investment styles hahaha
Dude it‚Äôs Philly, it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time we had looting/rioting this week. It‚Äôs gonna be so much worse with a trump victory.
Tech goes up, sell a few contracts, buy weed, weed goes up a bit. All day.
Bought one 45 dte otm $NIO for shits and giggles but other than that I'm staying the fuck away until election shit dies down.
So you‚Äôre still claiming it was just short covering? Ok Bobby stay in denial, no one can see you cry behind a screen.
NIO üòçüòç Tim apple got nothing on my new love
this is wallstreetbets not politics
Is a 339-341 iron condor expiring tomorrow stupid? Break evens 338.14 and 341.86

VXX tracks SPY puts. Bears too afraid to buy puts because of very legal pumps
why tf is vxx dumping with spy
it's obvious to me now that whatever i think is the obvious play means it is too obvious thus i should obviously do the reverse

i don't understand how options work but what would happen if things went the other way? does the account go into a deficit of 380k?
LIMIT BUY UVXY AT $19.40 and take a ride with me brothers
Just go to sleep, it will keep going up.
We will get Florida and if Biden wins then it's gg

Bruh, I meant relative to other states.
This option has an open interest of 302 with a bid of 1.41 with 200-ish size, I put in two bids at 1.45 and the bids suddenly became 1.45 with 232 size lol
Raise your hand if you sold your puts at the very top.

VIX up, VXX down

Haha fuck my ass
Trump losing bigly
[removed]
Leaves order at market, price gaps higher and order isn't filled

Leaves order 10% below market to catch the dip, price dives lower and immediately holding at a loss

.........
Market is rallying to create the perfect short selling opportunity lol- remember you can make money on both movements.

Regardless of election outcome, SPY is likely going to fall. It makes perfect sense to get it nice and fat and juicy before this afternoon/evening.
I‚Äôm buying a Border Collie next week, I‚Äôm going to name him/her Nio
Slightly green on optimism. Red on Wednesday if we get no clear winner.
The best icing on the 2020 cake would be if the election was contested between kayne and jojo
Should've bought leaps some of my $20 strike Jan 21 calls went x8 from $2 to $16 a contract, this was back when NIO was 14-16
That's actually super interesting. Instead of reading about the election, I shall learn about old gasoline pumps today.
[deleted]
Oooo this is definitely one I‚Äôll want to watch. A bank down since the virus? Especially Citibank
if we break 336.5 then 335.5 here we could push down to 333.5 and then consolidate at open levels for a bit probably before there is another large move
It‚Äôs to kill your calls
AAPL dumplings
VIX never fails to disappoint.
Hoping for it to break into the 12's today
Wow..... thanks bro.
NIO $40 by friday.
Lol at the market baiting everyone in to buy equities since open just to pull the fat rug underneath everyone for the rest of the day
That's a heavy statement. Did you at least position yourself in case (even a small position or hedge)?
[removed]
I bought mine Thursday afternoon, and surprisingly they are only down about 30%.
Finally green again after 40% loss in beginning of September. Almost all realized. Feels good bros
Lmao did they get the homie firstsquawk?
felt very long for me. especially the summer
I don't have the answer if it will drop or rally but I know within 15 days will be huge news/event to move the markets.

I know this because I have done my DD and if I show you the way I do it, it won't really benefit me anymore will it?

But lets just say this, I want you to look at the expirations of options of 15-18 days from today..

What do you notice if you look at all the strikes? It's not fun, but you should see it.

Tell me if you see it.
Lol this pump is so fake and gay

SPY and VXX both dumping ?
yeah ww3 is still like 6 years away
bro we all are! IV is insane atm.. theta/gamma cucking all of us!
Imagine stocking up for something that won‚Äôt happen,
That‚Äôs actually dope
Couldn‚Äôt check the market until now. Wtf is going on? Why bigly green??

Why is vxx not reacting to this spy dip
Biden is old school big business. He'll win and it's all goin UP!
Aside from being a fucking slug, Cheeturd is wildly unpredictable and the big money gets uncomfortable. Remember the China embargo? Yah. He's gone and we can all get back to gambling
Second and short, they go no huddle. Quick snap, and here's VIX on the keeper right side and he'll get enough to move the chains
This year went by so fast.
Possible outcome: Trump, Pence, chuck grassley, and Mike Pompeo all flee to China to avoid prosecution after  election.

By 25th amendment, this makes Pelosi president and Mnuchin VP

Over lame duck session they bond and release a giant stimmy

SPY 400c 12/18
IV crash scheduled for tomorrow. Think of it like earnings day for SPY.

VIX will drop like a rock even if we have a red day just like it mooned during green days in the last month.
My prediction was 35 eoy idek anymore
So I‚Äôm down by I would say a lot. diamond hands?
Having a statement such as "Seeing how carnival used to be 50$ a share and now it's fighting between 10 - 13$ a share" invalidates every single argument you could have made. New information, new price
If somehow we finish even I would be happy as a bear

What part of sell the news don't you understand? Smart money buys in early, hypes the stock, ER beat then use superior trade execution times to dump at pre-market/opening. Little guy as usual left holding the bag.

I also felt like it but my fomo is getting strong hahaha I like crm and baba a lot more then aapl to be honest. Nee is the only solar stock I would feel comfortable holding and I don‚Äôt know much about arry cause they are new right? U planning on sitting out until tomorrow on options?
Do you use whether the first ten minutes are red/green as an inverse indicator for what will happen for the first few hours? The entire time I‚Äôve being watching aapl, until around noon is always an inverse of those first ten minutes
You‚Äôre a pardon turkey then ü§°

Tesla Jan 2023 spreads and let it sit. Could go for like a 500/600 spread or something lower. 

Tesla‚Äôs growth and release of autonomous driving over the next few years should easily drive this to the break even point on this
I've tried that a lot. Maybe this time it'll work. I know I can 10x this time.
When the stock market is lower on Oct 31 than it was on July 31st, statistically the incumbent loses.

That sort of stuff did happen in the Depression. There were a few guys who closed out their positions, then killed themselves. A couple other traders went home, closed out their apartments, sold everything, and became hobos.

I bought $25 worth of NIO stocks when it was $4. So like 6 stocks. I‚Äôve made almost a couple of hundred bucks of profit, but I wish I‚Äôd spent $1000 and not $25 :(

i've been there brother. firsts are so tough becuause its tough to imagine the future or anything past the shitty moment you're in. best thing i can say & advice I can give  is just take this time to work on yourself and be the best version of you. use it as motivation to become a better person. it's alright to take some time and be sad, but make sure you're surrounding yourself with people that are supportive of you and push you to get out of your comfort zone. break ups are hard - but in the long term you'll be glad you went through them because they do make you stronger. find some hobbies, get yourself active, make sure you're working out everyday and releasing those endorphins. all that little stuff helps. also, you're probably super fucking young and have your entire life ahead of you. i'm 32, single and loving my life right now. don't sell yourself short or worry about some girl. keep crushing it and lets get this moneeeeeeeeeeey

Amd/NIO/TSLA/c/m/spy/apple.   Mostly calls, sold some puts that are all green.
Haha the first time I bought a put was at the bottom in March
That Amazon consolidation tho.
Yeah its *theoretically* possible but most 21 year olds dont or cant do that either due to living in high COL, or even areas where the minimum wage is still 7.25 an hour, having to pay for unforseen life expenses, paying for college or being irresponsible with money due to age. Also gotta factor in that a lot of highschoolers can't have a job due to grades or simply because their parents won't let them, and even among those that do get jobs many will receive less than 20 hours a week.

16k in savings is definitely [not the average savings for the 18-24 age group](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/09/14/how-much-money-the-average-millennial-has-in-savings.html) most have less than 1k in their bank accounts so average savings for a 21 year old is sub 1k. We'd be living in an entirely different world right now where socialized medicine and hiking the min wage wouldn't even be a debate if your average 21 yo had 16k laying around. That would be more than enough to cover most medical copays and set you up to have a good future at a young age if you invest that properly.

Funny how this is upvoted now, but WSB was 100% certain over the weekend that there will be total chaos this week, resulting in huge market losses.
I sold too early. NIO is a great November tendie maker.
I'd be surprised if I went back to the office at any time in 2021 at this rate.
It probably will imo, dip after earnings
We only riot when our team wins sports championships
FUCK why did I do spreads on ANETü§°ü§°ü§° I closed so many fucking short legs on the dip but thought to myself "eh no way it will go through $230 I'll just keep it" DOPE I'm a sucker
People commenting they are glad their put orders did not fill.

Do you just place orders and go back to touching yourself?   
Doesn't your phone/webapp notify of orders being filled?  
Don't you know you can move closer to ask end of spread and your orders have higher chace to fill?  
And SPY has 1 cent bid-ask spread, how cheap are you that unwilling to pay one cent more to fill your put orders.

From the end of last year I thought the market was going crazy-bull too hard and I stopped buying shares like I normally did for the past 10+ years. Just sitting on a pile of cash now. It was the crash in March that made me buy just a bit, but I still got some reserve cash because stuff seems crazy this year and I want it to go "back to normal". I also gambled a bit since discovering this sub & learning about options, but I still got a good cash pile waiting for normal responsible investing.

The benchmark S&P 500, which has predicted the winner of 87% of all presidential elections and every one since 1984, added 1.2% from July 31 through Monday.

Typically, a gain in the three months leading up to the election has signaled a victory for the incumbent party while a loss signaled a transfer of power.

the market seems pretty confident here haha I have no idea what that's based on
Last week all tech stocks were mooning on anticipation of earnings and they all crashed after earnings even though they all beat. I wonder if we'll have something like that tonight and tomorrow morning.
Looking at those 344 puts
Hmm, doesn't look good for the puts
[deleted]
Caveat: One thing to watch out for is a very high voter turnout. That'll tip the scales towards Biden. But it'll be a really huge increase in voter turnout compared to the last 2 presidential elections.
This is my biggest issue for sure. Definitely plan to take a break - it's hard not to take a break when you're brok.e
Glad someone is smart enough to listen to experience these days. I don't make plays without actual testaments from people. Retards these days think their opinion on what direction a stock is gonna go actually matters, when in actuality, the facts of the situation are what do. Thanks for giving me the time of day big man :)

I hate seeing any industry suffer.  My question is, after this pandemic, who wants to go on a cruise and risk being quarantined for a month.  Imagine being locked in a small room with no windows for a month.  A stateroom, may be more bearable but I can barely last in my home for two days.
GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDD YEAR BABY!!!!!! My secret diamond in the rough no one GAF about because it isn't tech.  Just a nice little 500% gain on calls today.  IV and IVP are allllllllways reasonable on GT, and the constant 3-7% swings make it a goldmine for options plays.

Of course it is, eventually.  The biggest IPO in the world was bound to have some regulatory hurdles to clear in a country like China.  Also BABA won‚Äôt care when they crush sales on Singles Day next week so it‚Äôs still one of the best short term plays available rn imo.

Just so you know EVs are going up because the Chinese government has a goal if becoming an EV leader which means selling more cars. The way they are doing that is restricting new licenses for gas powered vehicles and making electric vehicles more easy to register. This is why Li Auto and Xpeng are also going up, and why Tesla also had a run up because they operate in China. If anything if this is apart of Chinas 5 year plan then holding for 5 years isn't that bad of an idea.
I have the same number of shares as you do at a slightly worse price (average about 10.40) though I feel like I haven't bought enough and I'm considering taking a bigger position.   I have an IRA with a little over $25k cash and I'm considering going all-in PLTR with that account as well.

Like you, I'm in for the long haul, so I'm not really concerned where it goes after earnings, other than the fact that it might be my last chance to buy at these levels.

Edit:  actually this is not entirely accurate since I picked up half my position by being assigned on puts that I sold.  The premium collected does not reduce my average cost as displayed by IBKR, even though it does for tax purposes.

Just accept that the market is pretty random.  It does not only reflect the value of a company, but also changing perceptions of value, material information, dividend payments, the re-balancing of large positions, the expiration of hedges, accidental large order submissions, sudden spikes triggering chain reactions of stopped out positions, algorithms trading on indicators, market makers remaining delta neutral, insider trading, etc.  Sometimes the market moves up because some whale out there is hedging an even bigger short position.  You never really know

What plays would that be for Trump?  Like Weed and Solar are the top of my head plays for Biden.   I would be slightly concerned about Google, Facebook and Apple with a Biden win simply due to antitrust and possibly a dip in health insurers with possibility of public option.  Struggling to think of specific plays for a Trump win though.

Yeah, no way you made that much from investing your tutoring money lmfao. High doubts some high schooler who‚Äôs brand new to investing pulled that off. 

Also 10-15k is a lot of money *for a highschooler* lol. Especially around the time you would have been in highschool given that you supposedly have a PHD and have been working long enough to land a 7 figure job. A highschooler being able to save that much is pretty impressive and virtually unheard of especially back then. 

Thats a nice bullshit story you‚Äôve created for yourself there.

EDIT: also just FYI, you literally would not be here as a supposed ‚Äúdecamillionaire‚Äù with a supposed high profile 7 fig job and no way there‚Äôs some secret group of ‚Äúdecamillionaires‚Äù wasting their time on WSB of all places.
if we break 338 we go to 340 then most likely see a reversal down to 336.5-335.5
Learn from what went wrong, make plans to never do that again, give yourself credit for being able to take that much of a hit and survive.

It's definitely better. SPY broke through its pre covid highs while IWM still hasn't. 

And during the Feb-March crash, IWM dropped 43% while SPY dropped 35%.

SPY, Dow, and NASDAQ are the 3 indexes everyone watches, no one cares about the Russell 2000 so less incentive for them to pump it. To pump SPY, they just need to focus on a handful of stocks.
yeah, so if trump wins florida it pretty much means its over, he just has to snag a few battle grounds.

Why do you think trump is guaranteed to give stimulus? He doesn‚Äôt care about citizens and he doesn‚Äôt have another election to win. There‚Äôs no personal gain for him to do it so why would he? As of right now it makes sense to talk about because he wants to win. I guarantee he drops all talks about it if he wins.

Anyone ever get a cramp in one side of their neck? Like at the front, the muscle just tightens up and your mouth gets pulled down slightly. It usually takes like 20 seconds then it loosens up slowly, but in that time that side of your face from the mouth down gets pulled like you're having a stroke. Anyway last time I smoked some weed I got paranoid "what if I was actually having a stroke all those times and I've actually had like 100 strokes?" and I got all nervous about being severely retarded as a consequence. Then an hour later I was drunk thinking 100 strokes... THAT'S COOL. 100 STROKES AND I'M STILL WALKING.

I think the market is pricing in the best parts of a Biden win, Trump win, civil war, alien invasion and plague inc like pandemic. Hence, every freaking thing is mooning.
I was in a rush and set a stop loss of 4.30 for my 4 FB 11/06 270c but accidentally just did a limit order instead and it executed at 4.68. Could have sold 6.50 üò≠
Ha true I know it‚Äôs all about risk here in WSB but even the biggest degen knows not to risk your whole portfolio of 100k on one ticker. This guy doubled his money. The smart thing to do is sell half diversify and he can still retire early if NIO goes to the moon.
Dude, have you not reviewed the DFX threshold yet?  It's showing a PMR double-wide XRT and I'm thinking that with the 4DS hitting a new PDD, that we're looking at a definitive coil-up unwind down to the KKF levels we saw when the CVC hit that point

I bought these a couple weeks ago. It's not too late. It's gonna keep going up.
Everyone who bought the "erection bad for stonks" narrative went all cash by eod yesterday. That's why there's no sellers today. All the sellers already went cash and now they're trying to get back in before it's too late.

He needs a shit load more than Florida to win this election.

Trump **requires** Florida to win. He has basically no path to victory without it.
You're right that it isn't a slim cut but it's definitely snug/fits correctly in key places which partly helps a suit to look good on someone. You're right though, you want a suit that's right for your body type. A slim cut suit is good for thinner/fit people.

the democratic party is borderline neoconservative. and biden is a middle-of-the-road democrat.

the only reason you think they aren't moderate is because republicans have [lurched so far to the right over the last 10-20 years](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/31/the-republican-party-has-lurched-towards-populism-and-illiberalism) that democrats seem extreme by comparison.

buy 100 shares of stonk at $10 each.  Sell call to retard at $15 each that expire in a week.  He hands you $20 right away(premium you keep regardless of how it plays out you can buy yourself some coffee with this right away.)  Friday comes and stock is $10.10.  You laugh, he obviously does not buy your shares, and you do it again next week.  It's safer than purely holding shares.  You really can't fuck it up.

Just like throw $20k into it, sell like 400 spreads, each one work $0.10, boom,  $4k in one week. (assuming it doesn't go past the short position, of course)
That literally doesn‚Äôt matter
Just buy NIO stock and VRYYF stock and NFLX and sit for a few months
Mods hate me I think
From my notes on March 5th: market had experienced a 1,000 point rally after Biden became the presumptive nominee and the field threw their support behind him. Market ended up crashing the following week.

IMO today is a relief rally and puts are on sale. We‚Äôre still in a pretty significant downtrend. Also don‚Äôt think many are considering the possibility of a split White House and senate and what the implications of that would be for stimmy. R/R on DIA/QQQ/IWM puts is good here but I‚Äôll probably wait to see if we get a massive 1,000+ point rally into the close, which feels likely.

Yea 290 is my target for eom. Nothing has changed in the last week. Way too many people are expecting a post election rally and for vol to die. I think the opposite will happen regardless of the election results. We going to see some shit before we get the next big bull run imo
It missed by 1%. That‚Äôs pretty damn good.

I love the undue optimism on spy.  The only bullish scenario for a large and quick stimulus is Trump with a blue senate and house.  Any other scenario has it pushed out to Feb

Account less than a year old saying how great this sub was years ago. Then proceeds to shill for Trump... very legit
I'm thinking TLT calls. It's oversold and at the bottom of its bollinger band and support trendline, so even if it doesn't pan out, you'll likely make a little money

I‚Äôm just going to start playing aapl daily exclusively like that jelqing guy. If it dumps in the first ten minutes, it goes up for at least part of the day. If it pumps in the first ten minutes, it dumps for part of the day. Pretty much free money if you ask me
This dudes suit isn‚Äôt that snug. Check out the pants, they‚Äôre a pretty fully cut. The jacket fits in the shoulders and waist but isn‚Äôt really a slim cut.

But slim fitting suit off the rack will always look good on a reasonably fit person
i mean, yes, that appears to be the case. it's extremely retarded but i cannot ignore the evidence any longer
Wondering the same, I have 325p expiring Friday. Wasn‚Äôt expecting the market to moon today, thought today would be flat then tank tomorrow on election fuckery.
I know I transferred a fresh 10k in just for NIO didn't settle in my account until yesterday was seemed like it was to late so I just let my smaller position ride until about an hour ago. Hoping it dips again.
Solar gets all the mainstream hype but thorium reactors are the way of the future

Just like puts above 420
Are Gold/silver puts crazy/autistic as a hedge
Yes because this market is clearly under valued and everyone wants to put their life savings into some juicy trillion dollar market cap stocks
BABA is falling due to ANT IPO mishandling/corruption
Sell after the pump declares victory but before Biden is deemed winner. Once the outcome is clear IV crush will get you.
This is absurd. I know this is WSB, but there‚Äôs far more evidence that China would benefit from another 4 years of Trump... If Biden is elected expect a coalition of countries battling with China, placing much harder restrictions and sanctions (for various reasons ie human rights violations and Taiwan related issues, things Trump ignored because he was/is a pussy)... Trump thought the US could win a trade war against China alone, which any person who took an economics class from Grand Canyon university could tell you that wouldn‚Äôt work.

Master degree in CS / PhD statistics drop out

$180k + 20% bonus + \~800k in RSUs over 4 years.
538s been looking at a full dem sweep, House, Senate, and executive. That's just leaves expelling the Supreme Court, and we have a neoliberal America. Call it a neoliberal revolution, let's see how long it lasts

Consider these next four years to be the strongest growth the market will ever see, before we have a great crash due to low IR like Japan and the credit crunch. Then it's just going to be sideways for 29 years
I bought nio 25c 1/15 some time back and I‚Äôm up 100%, anyone have any advice should I hold or sell and get a later date
These are unprecedented times. Wouldn't rely on past data, especially when it's at least 4 years old.
It has nothing to do with politics, just probability. Start using reason and rationality and stop letting biases cloud your judgment.
I normally don‚Äôt even touch that shit cause I pretend to be ‚û°Ô∏èüêÇbut i figured the uncertainty around this election would make the market piss it‚Äôs pants.

Why? Cause I‚Äôm retarded bitch
Game over
Well I goofed thought this was r/smallstreetbets
you would have lost a lot of money if you used it  September 4-September 15... you only make money with movement. sometimes spy doesn't move. these days will lose you 10-20% a day until you're out of money
I am also and I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happenüòÇüòÇ
VXX 11/20 $26c
honestly why im debating it. i need to inverse myself
I remember when I was hoping for NIO to break the $15 barrier.

nothing more than pure naivety
are they dumping so I can buy in? is this a sign? what do friendo
This is the worst day of my life... so far
let the dumping begin
Maybe in a normal election, where the uncertainty might already be priced in, I don't think it's possible bro price I'm the difference between a trump or a biden win here
I was a bear, all I‚Äôm saying is... since Ive switched to calls I‚Äôm actually having a green day

It's hard but honestly life is hard. It's a bitch being alive. It's so hard. The least you could do is be on your own side. Think about if you spend even half the time you spent thinking about her, thinking about yourself. You'd be leaps and bounds ahead in your personal development. I promise you it is really hard not to love people that are really in love with themselves - and prove it every day. 

When you respect yourself your energy your effort and your (VERY LIMITED INCREDIBLY LIMITED) time on this planet everyone can see it and everyone can feel it - and better than that the people that make their way into your life from that point forward will have the same deep respect and admiration for you that you have for yourself. You are inexhaustible - you need more money? You can work. You want to be in better shape? You can work. You want to see the world? You can travel. That level of self love and self respect is infectious. Every single good thing in your life comes from you and your effort. Good luck figuring it out bud i've been there and I'm telling you where I'm standing is infinitely better than where I was (now the girl in my scenario has wanted to claw her way back into my life - the other nice thing is once you develop that self love and self respect you won't even have a real romantic interest about anyone that doesn't feel that same deep enthusiasm for you every second of every day, the same way you do)

everyone is bullish on WSB so you know what that means.
Anyone in FUBO?
NIO IS GOING FOR 35!
You are mentally capacitated if you didn‚Äôt buy the PayPal dip
Does that mean you also fomo‚Äôd into spy calls at the top?
Lol
Dayum
All of the idiots who are obsessed with politics are done selling and people who care about fucking business are going back to work.

This pump seems orchestrated, planned. On the sidelines I‚Äôm just an amateur
This is the way.

Warning for fellow autists stay away from atvi. Today confirms the crazy sell pressure from Institutions that own 93% of the company. Even as other gaming companies are mooning this shit is stuck. Confirms buy puts for this shit company
PayPal almost green already. Today's freest money dip
It's time to switch to puts

Still working on deciding positions. That will take time though. But I'm pretty sure there are many redditors on this sub who are much better equipped to come up with positions to play this scenario. I know what I'm doing with data science. I don't know what I'm doing with trading.
just hold. Today is MM just fucking over peoples short positions and puts.

Mango and Sleepy are going to both contest the election even if one of them wins by a wideish margin. Only way that doesnt happen is if it is a completer landslide and even then one may not concede
Jesus, 290 lol. If that were even remotely true, the dollar wouldn‚Äôt have broken down literally on the day of the election. TLT as well. Stimulus getting priced in

Oh SPY puts...why do you always drag me back in lol
For the second fat pump?
I know it‚Äôs all fun and games but this is clearly a fake pump... it‚Äôs a bottom 9th with full count for mango
MODS: Can we ban the word "imagine"?

Today will be mostly republican voters, so keep that in mind when reading exit polls

If exit polling is showing a narrow trump lead or a biden lead, that means its going to be a biden blowout.
I bought a 43C for May a couple weeks back. At the rate it's going it may print by the end of the year

Seems like a pretty dumb rally at this point considering what‚Äôs about to happen. It also seems that both trump and Biden trades are going up. Long yields also going up a shit ton, this should not be good for stocks especially the growthy names üò≥
NIO 35.50 eod
Bro, he‚Äôs literally only 3 years older than Trump lol I know y‚Äôall are shit with numbers but 3 isn‚Äôt a lot.
Your flair has to be the funniest shit I've seen this week.
They care about dick size.  Unless the girls at Pornhub are full of crap.
So half this sub was wiped out when they had calls and we dipped for a few days. Then they switched to puts for this week and the market is up like this. 

Love y‚Äôall but LMAO
Happy to help
[deleted]
Thanks, done.
Why would the markets be up on the prospect of Trump as president with likely Dem control of Congress? A unified dem control scenario = big stimulus and right now the polls show that is the most likely outcome.

I am not saying it will happen but algos run on probabilities.
I think so. I've got $40c 12/4
UPS has a tasty gap to fill and looks like it broke out of its post-earnings slam jammer

TSLA order book super lopsided yet it continues to pump. Amazing
My FDs didn‚Äôt go to 0 I‚Äôm amazed

It doesn‚Äôt move as aggressively as TAN plus with SEDG tanking tan I feel like it‚Äôs oversold to hell right now. I DO have 4/2021 $30 ICLN leaps already tho
my funds are on hold til tomorrow. Maybe for good reason.

CASH GANG.
If nothing is concrete yet, why the fuck are you making concrete statements?
Trump really called that rapper little pimp lol
Perfect, thanks didnt think of that
Bears please don‚Äôt be delusional we‚Äôve quite clearly broken that downward trend, we might get a red day or too but don‚Äôt go full send on puts, be nimble here
anyone playing QCOM ER ?
Market news for 11/3:

Stonks rise on hope of hope
gme 13 eow please let me fucking win for once
Imagine if cash gang right now hopes for a landslide win, expecting for another decisive bull run to begin tomorrow, only to get a rug pull for an unknown reason.

I am part of cash gang.
Lol people shouting incoming dump ... This pump train ain't stopping soon
Sounds ominous
I would have made the same call. Don't listen to these retards they put all their money into SPY puts and SQQQ calls. Seeing how carnival used to be 50$ a share and now it's fighting between 10 - 13$ a share. If you kept up with cruise line news also the CDC is allowing cruises once the ban is lifted, but most won't start till the beginning of next year according to a few articles I've read. Carnival and RCL being the two that stated this.
Market is super green today, pulling everything up with it.
Whats funny is no one knows why the fuck this market is going up right now:

"Clearly the market pricing in a Trump victory, the market may never go down again"

"This is definitely the market factoring in a Biden win followed by an immediate stimulus"
buy order comes in above my limit sell. my order doesn't fill. i'm stuck holding. thanks, fidelity.

dude tsla is literally death. IV is too high
no wonder we're mooning
This is the way
too late i have paper hands and they're only monthlies. if they were leaps (which i dont have the capital for) i would hold until 530-540 but alas.
I think I‚Äôm on the wrong sub for this kind of talk
How are the bears feeling?
What was the outcomes of that? Repealing Glass-Stegal didn‚Äôt crash the world economy

If you mean oil and gas, people will nationally be encouraged to wear masks and socially distance, virus will reduce in prevalence enabling more reopening, more cars on the road for going places, more oil consumption.
If this bitch has the nerve to touch 340 before the most highly contested election of all time...well then, I‚Äôm all the fuck in on puts
Top US Generals held a video call with news anchors this weekend assuring them the military will play no role in the election.

I didn't realize national sandwich day would be such a big catalyst for the markets. I'm marking November 3rd on my calendar for next year.

We have the House of Representatives which is supposed to work the same way but there are still mostly two parties bc independents get crushed and the only thing one party hates more than the other is a third party
I should not be making money rn lol
Seriously what happened to BABA?
As an American I don‚Äôt like the two party system, we have more you can vote for but they get like 3% of the vote each year. 

I‚Äôm somewhere between libertarian and conservative, just small government minded outside of green issues and road building etc. The Libertarian party always just seems so edgy and until this year they just can‚Äôt seem to put a palatable candidate up on the ballot and never get enough support to get into one of the debates.

I don‚Äôt get why Libertarians don‚Äôt get more support tbh, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlet states figure it out on a smaller level‚Äù appeal and Libertarians don‚Äôt give a fuck, live your life however you choose, it‚Äôs a free country do what you want as long as it doesn‚Äôt infringe on others in a meaningful way.
and thats why vix is down 3.5%?
Are you lost?

Here is the deal:

I watched a documentary about what happened to Bill Clinton. 

He ran on raising taxes and more regulation. 

On day 1 bankers came in and told him if he doesn't cut wall street regulation and raises taxes economy would tank.

He agreed and never raised taxes. 90's saw huge market gains.

Jesus man stop playing weeklies (assuming you bought these recently).

I can't tell you what to do because I would never get myself into this retarded position, so I can't relate. Sorry

Edit: The only thing I can say is IV crush might ruin you even if you're directionally correct. At this point you're betting on a Sleepy win with Mango contesting the election.

After trump says he won before 60% of the votes are counted, you betcha
Oil/coal/natural gas companies get subsidies from the federal government to bolster profit and stabilize energy prices. Presumably under blue government that money would start going to wind, solar, etc
if trump does lose he's going to do his best to tank the market.

Volume predictably low today.

People ain't tryna get fucked by weird shit happening today
20k volume on 1dte 351c's

But why male models
You need to sell calls if you have shares as collateral. You sell puts when you have cash as collateral.
At least 4 years lol
Do you already have a pending order?
Haha all good signs of a good trader (joking). Good luck though, these fuckers will be really nice to you when you're up but as soon as you're down and under they'll come out and attack. So definitely play it smart

Easier to make sure the system is kept the same if you have only 2 differing options to pick from. The status quo/"the system" is never vulnerable to radical change.
Selling your orders isn't illegal, loads of brokers do it.  Front running those orders is the no no.

Oh please. So if I gave 99 wall street bets users and 1 Stanley Druckenmiller each 1 million dollars and 5 years there is only a 1% chance he would perform the best? And a 1% chance he would perform the worst? Just because there is some chance involved doesn't mean luck is "the only" or even the the most important contributing factor to success. I guess its comforting for people who fail to believe people who win were just "lucky".
That was my position.  It would take a meteor to bring it back down at this point  to where I was.

Why is solar going down? Why is oil going up?
Strong resistance at SPY 338. I think it will break through though.
Either when it's obvious that Trump lost, or if Trump wins through ratfucking, there must be some shit. Whether markets care is another question.
No I was amazed it dropped below 400 so I picked the closest to money strike I could. 

For my strategy I need it low to sell covered calls against it on days like today

Yes. When Trump wins, various D-heavy cities (think NY, DC at least) will have idiot Biden supporters rioting. 

Then it is up to the local governors if they allow them to rampage or call in the national guard to bag them.

Note how the cities where streets are getting boarded up are all Democratic strongholds. They have very few Trump supporters, so they are not afraid of those somehow rioting over Trump losing...

It's like this. There are 2 worlds. 

1. The commoners that protest or riot; being angry about stimulus checks and threatening war if their man loses today. 

2. The upper-class people with money; investors. Rich people, or at least people who's income aren't impacted by covid. They just keep working from home gambling on the stock market; sometimes checking up on social media watching everyone else insult each other.

World_1 is definitely going to see some chaos tonight. 

World_2 is just chillin' trying to decide to buy the dip or short the market. They probably went to the store yesterday and again today to stock up on some stuff. Never forget Ron Whitey of Futurama:
> _"Now, my caddie's chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested."_

Investors are buying because they're becoming more & more confident in the outcome of this election and being all-cash is blasphemy to these people.

Anyways, I can't wait to see how this sub goes this evening. Stay safe.

See you morons on Friday üòÅ
I wonder if people are selling puts (were selling puts into this decline).  How do the MM make money if they have to create a market?
I agree. But also a teenie bit of biden vs trump
Yeah no matter what the polls say Trump is gonna declare himself the winner, then even if Biden is the clear winner Trump and co will pull out every trick in the book to try to steal it. Meanwhile Trump army will be in the streets wreaking havoc.
No way either of those two are getting it up without a little (read: a lot) of help. Calls on Cialis.

Nobody cares.

Wtf was that big red candle that made SPY drop $0.8 under a min?
You can't sell puts against shares that you own because a put is a promise to buy more shares at a specific price. You need to have the cash on hand to buy those shares if the put is exercised.

If you want to sell a put, you can cover it with a short position of -100 shares.
fuck it went back up

Sold my SPWR/PLUG calls this morning for 60% gains and rolled them into an 11/20 SEDG debit call spread ATM.  I figure it will recover from this drop after earnings--especially if Biden wins.
What do you do for $50k a month...
Heeeellll no.
lil Pimp
L M A O gay bears
If you look at P/C ratio and volume, seems everyone put a collar on their stocks. Gamma squeeze up (fucks over anyone who sold call and bought put). At the spikes, you can see the options exercising (100 shares at a time fills). People aren't buying, its dealers who are just fucking over option holders.

You can only sell calls using shares as collateral, have to have cash to sell puts. 

Retard.
Oh by a large margin
I‚Äôve definitely considered a few downsides. But if you look at past earnings, they did amazing in their ‚Äúworst‚Äù case scenario at the peak of the hoarding in march. They even had to shut the factory down for a corona outbreak during last quarter and still beat earning crazy. Makes me believe this quarter will knock out the park. They have a broad spectrum of brands from bow and arrow to hunting gear. I would definitely not put up this much $ if i wasn‚Äôt confident. I‚Äôm more worried about an overall market crash but even that i feel is a low chance with all the fed injections of stability
EM?

Going by that it would make sense for today to be flat or down and then either pump or tank tomorrow. A lot of states are saying it could take a couple of days to finish counting all of the votes this year and I doubt either candidate is going to concede until literally all of them are counted.
Apps apps apps to the moon

Calls on you good friend
Pollsters of networks inside battleground states count real votes as they go out showing Trump is winning -> this gets out to their friends in the media & Wallstreet -> SPY is up.
why can america only vote for 2 people lol, in europe we can vote for like 20 different parties and our vote actually matters even if the one we voted for didnt get majority. we have like 400 people controlling and voting for shit and if x party got 10% votes then they get 40 people from their party out of those 400.
Bears realize there same logic now applied in April and March when we had the greatest rally of all time ?

Work on yourself. Extend the same consideration you do towards her to yourself. Every second you spend thinking about her is time that would be better spent thinking about yourself. Learn to have a deep love and appreciation for who you are, why you are the way that you are, and be ready to address your shortcomings aggressively. The only way I've found to be happy and satisfied is to develop an aggressive predisposition towards health and healthy choices


That doesn't mean dont drink don't smoke fuck fried foods it means loving and respecting yourself enough to make the decisions that are best for you regardless of how hard or complicated or simple and easy they are. It means drink a beer if you want a beer, appreciate that your ability to move your body and your health in general is a privilege - getting to work out is a privilege, go date 6 girls if you want to date 6 girls, take yourself out to dinner. We might die tomorrow might as well live - and remember you are inexhaustible. Every single good thing in your life comes from you. Fill your cup.

We're talking cost not price. If it increased the cost (what expenses it takes to manufacture) there would be no benefit to advertising them as features when you could do something else that might be easier or cheaper. If it, however, does, you can then increase the price and margin of profit.
I need MSFT to go up 1 more dollar to break even on the retarded trade from last week. Break even = big time win in my book

Amazing enough for analysts to upgrade them crazy as well as multiple upward revisions of this quarters EPS and Revenue estimates

either that or prediction of blue sweep both are bullish for stocks
Tomorrow it will go to 500 and the day after to 420. Always  stays at 420
Welcome to the weekly meeting of **Bears Anonymous**

3. Rising Covid cases  
4. Grossly overvalued stocks  
5. Possibility of a civil uprising/riots

I got some of that sweet JPM divident today
Musk thinks the glorified adaptive cruise control feature on his depreciating cars is worth $100k so $10k is a bargain. Maybe if it was tied to the account but not the car. How many of you believe his bullshit?
Thank you. I will definitely look into it. I‚Äôm also considering TAN. I‚Äôm going to give myself at least a day to calm down though. I don‚Äôt make good decisions when I‚Äôm pumped with adrenaline.

Of course, most of us think/know/wonder if its total BS... but still...

McDonald's started house delivery this month in my country before any lockdowns were imposed. McDonald's NEVER had delivery here. Their drive through has a queue of at least 20-30 cars every night at peak hour. It's insane. It's highly unusual for junk food to be so popular here all of a sudden. Especially McDonald's which is considered seriously bad food here.
Ugh.  Sell my 11/6 SPY Puts right now for a 75% loss or hang on to them as a lottery ticket in the hopes for some market craziness and risk a 100% loss.  Why am I such a pussy?

I don't know. Maybe the fact we woke up this morning and people weren't burning down polling places?

I think this looks like a good play, but you have a "litterally can't go tit's up" additude which makes me weary. 

I have heard that the main reason there have been ammo shortages is because the U.S isn't mining for lead at all right now and there is a global shortage so buying overseas isn't easy either. Adding to that, brass, copper, and even gun powder is in short supply. I would add that prices are likely higher for those raw materials but that wont have an effect on demand because as we've seen people are willing to pay for even the opportunity to purchase ammunition. 

Adding to this, winter is coming. I haven't looked at what exactly this company sells for outdoor gear but assuming it is mostly camping supplies and things that are mainly used during the warmer months sales could take a hit. 

I'm loosing my train of thought, but there's just a few things to consider.

My thought exactly, by the looks of it I honestly think insiders know trump wins, so there loading up.
Nothing in particular, haha was just throwing it out there. There had quarterly earnings growth of 246% and I think they will keep going up
SO A LOCKDOWN!!!
I second
That's why the market is going up. If dems take senate and white house we get a monster stimulus and covid gets under control and the economy recovers.
why the heck is SPY up so much today

Cash gang is the winner
I'm getting worried that the Bears might still win. If Trump wins FL, and PA declares absentee ballots need to be counted for the final results, then we will drag this through the week and VIX will come back. Be decisive ppl, break one way or the other!!
News Friday but no insider trading
Because he just got insanely lucky. Chinese companies have a higher risk generally and the recovery play he's looking for or was planning for would generally have given him less returns over 5 years than he just got
It's possible but I don't see it causing a selloff. Not until the first shots of Civil War II are fired anyway
Nice when do you think you will sell? We might be heading into a recession in the next couple years
It‚Äôs super green because people are no longer uncertain that the worst case scenario of riots and fuckery will ensue? That is some big brain moves.

Or you're investing your loan money...

VXX calls the only calls not printing
That‚Äôs pretty much dangerous time for puts
SPXS calls are dirt cheap, so I've been getting those.
Yeah and once I build my porty up I‚Äôm gonna use options that INVOLVE shares because theta gang
I know right. And with how fast this pump happened it‚Äôs obviously low quality. Holding puts through the week because the real catalysts down haven‚Äôt even happened yet
GME gang we out here
Man not trying to be political, all speculation, but if Biden wins im sure going to miss the Trump Market lol, even pre covid everyone was fucking making money, real or not life was good, than buying the dip in march until now. Fuck man it was like a video game
Which one?
That's what I did. Right now going hard into options is going to either wipe you or make you a king. I'll probably get caught bagholding these shares because there will be a random dump soon, but whatever. The money will return as long as I don't go full retard and sell the bottom
Either way stock market hitting all time highs in January.  More stimulus will come.  This last dip has been another great opportunity.

I managed to put together a ton of money in college.  They just give away free money in the financial aid office. 

Now, idk what the difference between a grant and a loan is, and I sure as hell don't know the difference between a secured loan and an unsecured loan, and as far as I remember from high school, interest is a good thing, the banks pay it to you or something, idk, whatever, "Yes, I'll take all the money you offer me"

Fast forward a few years:  "Loan? huh?  PAY BACK? Dafuqyousay? How the hell can I pay that much money back?"

tl;dr if you're just retarded enough, you can convince yourself you have a bunch of money while you're in college.  Even if you just use it all for hotel parties, weed, and liquor.  At least OP considered trying to do something responsible with their ill-gotten gains

Wow mr. market, I thought you were big but not that big üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
Yeah, I got burned by puts that I bought Friday, so I bought calls near yesterday's bottom.
I‚Äôm fine with a flat day tomorrow.
This is the only reason that I don‚Äôt completely hate places like ‚ÄúMen‚Äôs warehouse‚Äù. When I first getting a job it came down to buying a suit at JC Penny and having it tailored to fit (but getting decent materials - not the best) or going to Men‚Äôs warehouse and getting a better fitting suit with shittier materials for the same price. At men‚Äôs warehouse (and similar stores) they will measure you and they have a massive amount of suits in every size so you can get an almost perfect fitting suit that needs minor modification. Where as at a department store they will measure you and just find the closest fit on the shelf and leave a lot of altercations to the tailor.
You forgot something
Bears talked so much shit this morning. I‚Äôm edging this shit till eod then releasing the most disgusting ü•ú ever

Retailers trying so hard to meme the stock they keep creating fake resistance and support barriers around 420 and fuck up their own moon ride.
No leaps, no thank you.
Renewables will have a huge impact but in a longer time frame ( 2-3 years )
Honestly never bought puts before. But wouldn't today be prime to pick some up EOD.

no, i know exactly what SPY will do because i have positions on it and it will do whatever is necessary to zero me
My theory: insiders are pricing in a government trifecta (big red wave or big blue wave). If one party controls the house, senate and presidency in an environment with zero inflation pressure, they could moon the economy and stock market.

Trading bot told me to buy calls 4 times since the summer (including yesterday), and I ignored it every time because of a whopper $600K loss that has made me very timid. If I had followed the bot those 4 times, I would've made ~$1.3M.
You are the one trying to understand and give reason to the market.

I am talking about the actual mechanics of the market.
How often have IPOs been suspended, historically?
what in the fuck is a campaign enthusiasm? Is that how people get elected?
So, just like every election since Wall Street opened?
Sorry, I missed this until after close.  I'm holding FDX, UPS, WMT for December and January expiration.  I picked up some PLUG last week for a run to $19 - $22 (according to the crayons), so far on track.  Yesterday, I  only picked up a little PYPL for earnings which of course failed miserably along with all of my other earnings plays.  Having finally learned my lesson this earnings season, I will unload all or most PLUG prior to the 11/9 call.
Just got into NIO. That was a mistake, right?

EDIT: LOL guess fucking not!!!!!!!
Yeah I‚Äôm thinking about just sitting out. There way too much going on.

I get that the market always inverses logic, but I'm confused as to who would be buying right now instead of just selling and going cash gang until next week just to be safe.
Yes. But doesn't make sense to fight it. I've lost so much money by being confident about an outcome but wrong about the timing. I'll switch to puts in a couple days.

Yes, discretionary spending is way lower for low- and middle-class people. Redistribution will propel the American economy to new heights, further concentration of wealth will however work as a big brake. 

It is economics really, money going towards inflated assets is factually less productive than money going towards well-valued and/or intangible assets.

Jerome speaking anytime soon? My puts need to be saved too lol
If you didn‚Äôt offload puts and buy calls at open, are you even trying?
again?  I have been selling puts for weeks.

(but stuck with some more in my hand)
Positions: covid
If Biden wins covid is over, PTON to zero
Anyone else looking at $XLV puts? Possible good opportunity if Biden wins and Dems win Senate and they seem relatively cheap
BABA did me dirty
I want to get back into plug but with longer dated options. Might wait until after tonight though.
Technically I'm mongolian so yes I am.
It assumes that stimulus happens faster and election uncertainty is gone.  The amount of money on the sidelines is crazy.  If this market drives higher people will have to capitulate and dive in.

I have been all in (unfortunately a bit early) and now I am reaping the benefits.  I think this train does go over SPY 350 by end of year.
Trump is realy retarded, i know both parties can do retarded things but he realy makes republicans look like a joke with this xanhead

The economy has just seen the biggest crash in history, this guy needed money to survive and he needed it quick so he figured he'd undercut how much other people were willing to pay. At least that's what I'm assuming.

Calls. Bad news priced in at open
Lol he already said he‚Äôs going to dispute it solely because of mail in ballots. It‚Äôs a ü§° show
Another reason I think this is pricing in a trump win is with all this crazy green, most Chinese stocks are actually down today lol say what you want about Trump but other countries know he doesn't take any shit.

LOL having such a downvoted post is even more satisfying than a highly upvote one
If it's Boeing, down you're going.

Shit is definitely going to be contested though. Curious to see what‚Äôs gonna happwn
We had riots and shit for 2 months and markets mooned.

Nothing matters because it doesnt impact the billionaires + multimillionaires. None if it is based on what little people do, how the economy functions, whether companies are profitable or not. The top 1% will continue to hoard cash/assets, you can see the debt going up, fed printing money, yet money velocity is down. 

Its game over tbh unless we allow markets to stagnate for years or a crash looks like fundamentals will never matter again.
yes. Volatility shouldn't go down in a contested election on election day lol
isn't the market a little over confident about a clean win and smooth transition?
What happened to papa, I mean baba.
What stop loss?
Ass play
Market rallying because it's pricing in a Biden win and trillions more in stimulus.

Market rallying because it's pricing in a Trump win and trillions more in stimulus.

Market rallying because everything is priced in.
Hope you meant 336 cuz you scared me
Yeah, my man looks fly as hell
lol, JPM rated Trump as better for stocks
the market will rally on hopes that the president will be selected soon
Down 0.8% because of dollar taking an elephant shit üëΩ
Yea but it allows them to increase cost because they can say it does these things.
Interesting now we see on the sidelines that's Michael VIX still dressed to play, pads on and everything, it looks like he's talking with the training staff and offensive coaches
Plug options all the way. It‚Äôs my favorite company and I intend to get back in with safer leaps soon.
Same. I‚Äôd rather keep cash than FOMO fake pump and then rug pulled tonight
Sell rumor buy blue wave. Huge stimulus package incoming
A Biden victory is baked into the underlying in that ETF already. I bet it sells off a bit no matter who wins. Sell the news.

Puts on Dow EOD?
Just use a spread to lock in the gains if the trade goes your direction and you're confident.
so uvxy for quick money?
I see no downside to baba December calls tbh
50% WSB were bearish in poll, 23% were bullish for today. Never fails!
It was ignored cause high end retail stores or a mom n pop shop aren‚Äôt weighted in the DOW
Baba calls or puts for tomorrow? $300 or $250??
What if uncontested?
This has more to do with HFT having access to option buyers & sellers information. They just play the opposite of what retail is doing, and take in the cash.
Agreed I think Florida is lost for Dems. Just like Nevada is lost to Republicans looking at the turnout in Clark County

for anyone thinking this is "rigged" or whatever, the entire market is algorithmic. that means the algos only incentive is selling the security for higher than it bought it for. jobs, lives, the actual company, it doesn't matter. if an algo can sell a million shares of zoom for $0.50 cents more than it bought the shares for, it just made 500k. investing is old news.
Sry bro, you r fuk
I hope MSFT is doing something real.
My thoughts exactly. Priced in for now, but could signal long term strength. Promise of a stimulus is much greater. Though, not till next year, so more slumps.

i got out at 285 so yea hes retarded
Nope, we continued the Jpow pump sesh like nothing was happening. Case spike in June made us sell off though
How many times will you idiots use logic to predict what will happen in market. We went through this in April when all the bears kept saying we will retest March lows like a mantra.
The entire move down and entire move up in the last week has nothing to do with anyone buying and selling. It's just a reverse gamma squeeze. MM sell stock as people buy puts. Now puts are further OTM, they buy stock back. Simple as that. It's not like every retail/institution decided to buy in the last hour, just like it's not like they decided to sell last week in bulk together.

I was holding a straddle on LYFT a few days ago. Expecting it to crash for the election, prop 22. Instead shares jumped 7 percent, I said screw it and cashed out everything at 36 percent gain. Not really sure what happened there
Did the stock market actually give a fuck during George Floyd unrest?

I thought they were already happening.
So many retarded bears are about to buy puts right now
Are the markets aware that Trump will continue to be president for approx 3 more months?  I'm sure he'll be a reasonable & responsible leader that will calmly transition the country's most powerful institutions to Biden's administration.
His grandkids would be rich
Yea, stopped watching CNBC in April
Market dumps on election uncertainties, second wave of COVID, European shutdowns and lack of stimmy.

A few days pass. None of the issues are resolved.

Market says "eh, screw it, I don't give a shit anymore" and rallies back to new highs.
Thoughts on Wayfair earnings?
It sounds like he cares
I always thought the narrative was that BABA was tight with CCP
just remember if a play is too obvious it's most likely priced in already.

Industrials, energy, and REITS those are my 2021 plays.
it makes sense yes but this market is irrational
That's like, your opinion, man :) I'd say if you want to understand everything about them, you should be reading about Austrian economics and the business cycle. That money printer keeps going Beer, and the bubbles keep getting bigger. At some point, we stop being a reserve currency, and the house of cards falls.
Common knowledge and priced in go hand in hand
Buy Jan calls.
Based on China just giving the company a slap and a warning despite them committing massive fraud, it's pretty safe to say they're government backed and not likely to go under now.

These accounts are so obviously purchased. Look at the history on that dude. Has never commented on WSB before the last few comments. Previously exclusively posted on a Hispanic pro soccer sub, and at some point just totally stopped doing that and only posted GOP talking points lmao
"if you want to trigger a lot of people, spew nonsense that causes them to lose their faith in humanity"
Trump already said he will not cause a ruckus if there is a winner, no games (enough for the market to pump). Put/Call ratio says a lot of people put collars on their stocks. This gamma squeeze ain't going to end.
1. Solid industry and believe in market/company
2. down right now and cant go below 10 which makes it safer
3. Either pres it goes up 
4. been having 5% sways for the past 2 months for me and has not gone below 14 (when I bought)

ICLN is surprisingly disappointing given the general market action and PLUG absolutely mooning right now
Markets domestic and abroad seem to be pricing in blue wave. The vol on futures tonight should make for some nice trading opportunities for anyone who wants to be a pajama trader because it is probably going to be touch and go even if that proves out.
Lol MM have to buy back all those shares they sold to hedge the puts they sold you guys that are worthless now.
Yep let's make some coin
Puts puts puts üåàüêª

no they were outlawed after the crash in 1929
Imagine buying puts at the bottom. Pamp eet
I was deep in debt but went into spy calls early morning made all my losses backüòé now stopping until president has been chosen
This screams to buy puts right?
mmm tasty
she kinda quirky üò≥
Okay let me break it down for you. This move means something will happen later that some people aren't going to like. Bank on it probably.
Ds 11/20 2.5 .03
The biggest gaurantee in life is that the market will always do the opposite of what the majority of people in here think it will.
Looks like $BABA left it's blinker on in the fastlane for too long ...
ANT IPO
A Biden win will make gun stocks rally hard. Interesting bet.
Markets voting Biden..
UVXY dropping again, VIX consolidating for leg down again lol
SPY has options expiring on Wednesdays. I knew there was a real reason election day is always a Tuesday.
Just sold everything...jumping out my 1 story window if market goes up now
Actually, you‚Äôve got a fair chance of catching some serious volatility. Just depends on what we know about the election by tomorrow. Pennsylvania will take weeks, so eyes are on Florida. Good luck, bro
As cash gang I have no clue what to do I don‚Äôt know if we keep trending up and enter bull market or if this is just MMS.

You need to realise that stocks go up and down and which way to bet

Fuck me if I wasn‚Äôt broke I‚Äôd be making so much money rn
It‚Äôs pretty fucking savage for the Chinese government to pull the plug on the Ant IPO this close.
Shit I accidentally went all in on spy puts for tomorrow
So no way we figure out who wins tonight so the market has to drop due to uncertainty like in 2000 with gore and bush???
I'm so happy I didn't buy puts yesterday
go for a run. better then therapy
IDK why anyone would buy puts, but this market is a house of cards built next to the ocean. When the tide comes in us poors are going to be fucked.
Check your ammo, we‚Äôre going on a bear hunt
Like Crumple Zones, Airbags, Anti-Lock Breaks, Traction Control, Seatbelts, all those alerts and backup cameras to tell you if someone is coming up on you. Cars are a shitload safer and more expensive.

BABA has to be oversold due to the ANT listing drama, and earnings are on Thursday. Bounced off 280 in premarket and at open drop.
Jesus guys I mean boomer analysts even told you. JPM even said "if theres a dip before the election, you should buy it".
I'm holding, is probably a panic, but BABA is solid (I hope lol)
I'd like to order 3 giant red candles, and make it a rush order please. Thank you.

No doubt it's risky. If bad news piles up regarding Covid, this shit is gonna tank right back to where it was. Shares are probably a good play for the most part, but you might get stuck bagholding a while. Short plays are very high risk high reward now imo. Bought some shares of stuff yesterday and some small hedge options, but gonna hang tight until the dust settles for playing short stuff
I bought puts at 327.9
My BRK/B leaps are coming back to life. Only 30% down now.
Buy puts. There‚Äôll be riots tomorrow. Shops are boarding up.
hey guys. earnings play here coupled with election shit that's not overpriced because of the election.

IV is insane today. Going to drop at some point
i'm hoping for just one thing now.

if we're back in STONKS ONLY GO UP territory, can i please have the 1030-1100 "bulls question life choices" dump before it recovers to go even higher?
Instructions unclear. Been buying since fridays eod rip
Ok
I‚Äôm gonna sell a covered call here soon
I will never financially recover from this
Tesla went off bro... been ages since that kind of move
So whats making it go up now ü•≥ü•≥

You can't say this is about blue wave US stimulus hopes boosting domestic demand. Global markets are all up even though Ant IPO got fucked and Europe is reliving the black death. This is just mania.

Lol for real, fuck every one of their puts. I'm surprised we didn't see more people larping and an autistic doctor shilling GME for Halloween.
Sold my SPY puts before they lost 50% of their value even though they are DEC dated. 

Still holding SPXU and SQQQ as hedges at this point though. It just doesn't feel right with such a low volume pump. 

That being said, now that my biggest bet is off the table, I'm sure this will whipsaw against me and I'll lose even more.
Ok Apple, I‚Äôm ready to get hurt again.
Also lost on DKNG... Luckily I only bought a few hundred dollars worth of options (expiry 11/13). Debating hopping in now with calls expiring next Spring

My puts are almost worthless .. 1000$ down the drain ...fuck it I‚Äôm not going to sell. They expire tomorrow .. spy 310$ ..
Yes sir, buy dip again
Paging /u/SolitaryEgg.  Tell me, how does it feel to be the dumbest asshole on WSB?
I sold all but one
Is this the great SPY short squeeze of 2020 or what?
Wonder what Google will be broken up into...
It's like people click, share and discuss their crap articles...thereby ensuring they publish more crap down the line.

Correct
LOL I BOUGHT VIXY YESTERDAY
Crsr gonna get short squeeze to fuk.
I'm down a lot on puts but I will hold them. I've seen this kind of melt up before.
So investors are back to not caring about corona but who are they pricing in will win tonight?
Good advice and a cool username you can slide. In reality I agree, it‚Äôs just annoying seeing all these nerds think they‚Äôre the next Michael Burry
1 day SPY iron condor 315/320 - 347-352, received 0.88 credit

 and got ripped for 6.30 commission for spy how even
Lol...what?
SPY puts at 3:59
I worked the corporate gig for a company that had 100,000+ employees. I built an independent income.  I knew I had fuck you money when this happened.

Me: "I want to take some time off.  How much can I have"

My Boss: "You mean more than your six weeks paid vacation?"

Me: "Yes.  What is the limit on unpaid vacation?"

My Boss: "Well there isn't one."

Me: " You better not tell me that."

My Boss: "Well there isn't."

Me: "Okay I'd like to take the next four months off."

My Boss: "Hold on what?"

They had to give it to me, but the next year this huge multibillion company suddenly had a limit on unpaid vacation.

I was still in my 20's. 

Now they knew it too. :)
Life is fucking cruel.. went cash gang last week and i know the moment i go back we will crash, until then the market is pumping 2% everyday
Can‚Äôt wait for bulls to get a good castration
Gimme play plz I can't believe I'm losing money on fucken GE puts
Fuck no. This is not the market pricing in a Mango victory
This has pump and dump written all over it
I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE
green af cause you didn‚Äôt buy
idk about anywhere else, but in the states I've lived in, if you don't register as one party or the other, you can't vote in primaries.

I honestly don't remember which side of the coin I flipped I ended up writing in, but that's how the system works

Just inverse WSB. After your post it started to take off. Thanks!
Sorry not talking about your position taking about the guy with long calls
Shorting AMC Top has been nice so far Green Day baby boys
Bears are going extinct by power lunch
Watch there be mass chaos in cities tonight and its too close to call anything and it will take atleast a week and the market moons the entire time lol
Sold calls yesterday, would have been up bigly today. As it goes.

Anyone think if Trump wins we get a circuit breaker?
TSLA has re-entered the chat üîã
[deleted]
Buy the rumor sell the news
mlmlwml
It looks like they take us higher just so we can drop really hard later on tonight
With an iron condor it‚Äôs maximum profit no matter what as long as it‚Äôs between the two at expiration right? So my spy break evens are 341.87 and 338.13
Yes, check it out if you don't want to understand anything about economics and the Federal Reserve. Guaranteed to get facts outright wrong, and miss critical information.
When you all called me autistic for saying TSLA under 400 was looking like a snack on Friday, I‚Äôll be enjoying my tendies today.
today, the People have elected bears to be r fuk.
Yeah but at that point it won‚Äôt matter. Like, if Trump refuses to concede after losing, say, PA and one of NC, FL, GA, or TX, then it doesn‚Äôt really matter what Trump will yell out. He wouldn‚Äôt win mathematically.
Bear trap

You retardos don't realize that it's BULLISH regardless of who wins
If it's a blue landslide then him contesting means nothing
Chances are like 40% (538)that we don‚Äôt know prez tomorrow. I DGAF, I‚Äôm thinking puts could totally go tits up, but they‚Äôre on sale
Best form of insurance there is. Plan for the worst hope for the best
Stonks go up is the news
I've been selling puts

#ThetaGang.

#Just sell credit put spreads on SPY and you'll see the computers kick it down real fast.
This will be the thing that kills this sub.   Straight up.
Do I sell these aapl calls 11/20
You know you had like an entire month to vote, right? You lazy fuck.
gap filled
Cool, then why are you responding to me
Should I sell out of SPXS $6 calls 11/20
Blue üåä =green
REPEAT AFTER ME:

TRUMP PUMP TRUMP PUMP TRUMP PUMP
The 319 level seems to be when the brrrr machine gets going. The market priced in a Biden victory. But let‚Äôs be real here, Trump is actually ahead in the polls. The question is this: Is wall st dumb enough to believe the MSM polls, or the actual on the ground info that shows campaign enthusiasm?
Which stock or brokerage?
How many times someones gonna post this picture here? üòÇ
its down over 6%???
...I'm down 61%..really hurts cause I thought this made sense.
Avg down on puts here

Not sure how much higher we can go. Might sell some spy and voo puts later today
TSLA‚Äôs popping. what the news?
This üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª knows when he's beat. Sold my puts at the open and bought some SPY 11/4 336c.
$6 + $15 foreign fee (charged a day later)
An earnings play on a gun company the day of an election that could nuke them?

Yeah, you've gotta be retarded.
Green as fuck. Why didn‚Äôt I buy smh
You guys stop jerking while you trade?
Its only custom to get burned by Activision.
weird. it was kind of the biggest story of the primary, how moderates coalesced behind the strongest moderate candidate rather than have Bernie Sanders win a plurality.

but hey, when you only pay attention to memes and OAN then it likely would be news to you
üôè
I need 360 by EOW, 380 by EOY, and 400 by Q1'21. Make it happen.
This is crazy. Pretty high, pretty fast
Nearly Everything has a big green dildo today

No tension is starting to pass. Anticipation of an event is always made more dramatic with our monkey brains. Things get ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù bc we hear bad news as fucking Armageddon when it in fact is just, bad news.

What is this
Lmaooooo where are all the guys who bought GME puts on Friday
We don‚Äôt care what bet you placed. Lmao

VIX isnt buying this
4chan /b/
This rally though. LMAO. No volume. Price is fooling you.
Someone's down 60% for the day?
I got puts that were in ITM at 335 yesterday, and now at a 35% loss...

ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
If I have an option for 11/27 and 12/18 and they shoot up, how close to exp do you wait?/ how much do I lose for exercising the option early? (Not saying im trying to do this today, but in the future if I‚Äôm up a lot.)
Saving your comment
That line has crept up to almost 7:1 in some books. It‚Äôs more likely he loses the popular vote by more votes this year but wins the electoral college.
Literally vertical holy crap
Always inverse WSB

VIX down to 34
Market clearly predicting a clean victory for either Mango or Sleepy. If anyone contests it, or Sleepy wins and Repubs keep the Senate, market will straight dump into a circuit breaker.
And by Cash we mean don't expect the ATMs to work.
End of hour at this rate
Take this with a heaping bucket of salt, as it was posted on Stocktwits, but the bulls there have generally been on point with info like this:

>According to unconfirmed media reports, NIO is preparing to expand its business beyond China, and start sales of ES8 and ES6 models in Europe in 2021.
You can buy options >5DTE?

Which app has that?
Sony might not have the biggest percents.. but they‚Äôve been green for the last 8 days straight going on 9. Consistent tendies.
Someone is gonna be caught buying the top here soon, a little out of control buying right before an election lol
Sounds like you owe me like a dollar
Time to reverse
Holy shit bois
it will take alot to go back to green, depending on % lost sell now.

Last chance to get out bulls, act wisely. don't fall for this hype
We aren‚Äôt even an hour into the trading day but it‚Äôs felt so long
Crank it up to 11.  You see, that's one more than 10, so it's more volume
I was agreeing with you,  and at open they definitely did when it drilled from 3004 to 2982
hope we do it today, then I can recoop all the L's I just took on my puts from yesterday LOL
If Biden wins it‚Äôs going sub 300
Thanks for the advice. I thought 9 weeks was too far
Enjoy the Green Day. When the result of the election wont be known until the end of the week, plus the chance that Donnie Boy will contest it. This is like the Pearl Harbor before the attack
looks like you unlocked the next level, bankruptcy

Tesla leap spreads, talking sept 2022 and Jan 2023. Near X5 or X10 your money on 700-800 or 800-900 strike spreads. It‚Äôs gonna be a stock darling next year.

Repeat ad Infinitum: stimulus run up soon (even if actual stim isn‚Äôt passed); vaccine / new therapeutics soon. The dip was there to be bought without being so leveraged as to not survive a few topsy turvy days meanwhile
Yeah I‚Äôm really dreading tomorrow
Broseph, the market prices things out years in advance lol(refer to the Tesla stock manual). But in the context of this convo, yes, it‚Äôs currently pricing in a victory. I‚Äôd guess we‚Äôre still only 1-2 months advance. The market moves fast, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised by the end of the week it‚Äôs pricing in a year in advance.
We're being set up for a spectacular fall

yeah idk, the MM's  just wanted to fuck bears today. Too bad I have no common sense and won't sell.
Last few weeks there‚Äôs been so much chatter about contested elections and uncertainty

The reality is that ü•≠ or Biden losing one or two key/tossup states is a wrap for either candidate. Biden losing PA and/or Michigan and Wisconsin. ü•≠ losing FL, GA, NC, TX. If any of those hits, this is over. 

Money just doesn‚Äôt want to get left behind once it‚Äôs shown that this won‚Äôt be contested.

Market on easy mode.
TSLA and NVDIA shared last week were THE PLAY. All of the gains and none of the stress of expiration

no, it is still not too late to buy calls
Lol.
Sold my spy calls kind of early for a 50% gain.  Should‚Äôve held, but I guess I can‚Äôt complain lol
DXY tanking, equities mooning.  Market is pricing in Biden win with a fuck-ton of stimulus boys.
Twitter, the bastion of truth and facts.
There‚Äôs no end in sight!! TSLA just keeps goin up!!!
My only thought is that the market thinks the unprecedented amount of votes will provide clarity and less conflict. That or we're in for the biggest rug pull of 2020.
"Democracy?"
I‚Äôve been tryna get back into NVDA for 6 months. Can‚Äôt believe I sold in March.
Lmao short squeeze
Why are stocks up on election day? I thought the relief rally would be after election so tomorrow?
Well, my SPY put was not the move I guess. Didn‚Äôt see this shitshow of an election pumping the market like this...
Old resistance is 3393, previous ATH
Are you joking
Watch for reversal at 338
But you believe those who were smart enough to go cash gang for the election would wait until the day of the election when choosing to sell?
It's bullish for January because they expect him to spend a lot on stimulus and infrastructure bills. But that also means he would need Senate cooperation to pass those spending bills.

There's nothing bullish happening in the next couple months however.
IMO AAL won't exist by then
ah shit, tesla calls i sold ü§Ø

Damn bro I don‚Äôt expect this shit to hold tho maybe after today it will taper off
I feel so smart, being late on buying puts, and buying calls instead üòÇ
This could work, but I think this is typically how people lose money on the market. Fighting trends.. although I do feel like a drop wouldn‚Äôt be unreasonable

Am I retarded for thinking AAL calls expiring in July are good play? Seems like reopening and a Biden win could push it up to $15
Be careful...every 10 points up..the next moment it will drop 5%

Nasdaq is pumping out of its mind.

man, even GME get's a little love today

I got a GREAT entry on NIO 12/18 40c this morning when it dipped down to 32.8. Also nabbed 11/13 40c for the memes with the spare $45 I had left over.
Newsflash: The "market" is actually comprised of millions of individuals making individual decisions in non-hive-mind-like fashion.
The VIX trend is less telling than the level, when it's this high. IMO.
Not if shit hits the fan

üö® This is not a drill. TSLA going full autism mode. Get in boys
Retards have woken up from their slumber
have been holding VXX and TLT calls 12/18 expiry after some retard suggested here. It has been bleeding since. where's that guy?
Is the market really factoring in a Biden win right now?? Is that what‚Äôs causing this?
Love it, thank you
That‚Äôs the thing. I can actually feel it coming very soon. That‚Äôs why I just double down on my SPY puts and VXX/UVXY calls 5 mins ago. Either I end up rich or lose some hard earned cash. Worth the risk
I want to load up on NIO under 28 again lol.
Is there anything left to buy the dip on?
lol keep telling yourself that, ‚ÄúMr.Big brain macro thinking gay bear‚Äù 

People who lose the most money in the stock market are often the ones who think they ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the market
Don‚Äôt get stupid boys. 538 puts chances of knowing the likely winner by market open tomorrow at 60%. Save a little bit to throw on some aggressive shit if the coin lands on the other side. More money to be made there
Dam feels like there is no more downside in the market. Just buy stocks.

As green as everything is though I‚Äôm not adding anything more until probably after we get done results. Probably will miss out on some extra gains (outside my current positions) but shits so risky
I would roll. Tough timing though cuz if Biden is declared winner tonight it would likely get a big quick pump tomorrow but if not then down we go.

Starbucks never closed around here, just the inside.  Most of the local coffee shops got steamrolled by lost sales and subsequently closed. More people are working from home so are setting their own hours therefore have plenty of free time to go get a $7 carmel breve latte with a caramel swirl and whipped cream and sprinkles and a fucking cherry on top or whatever these cretins drink.  On top of that, as per the "hot waitress index", they've had a chance to bolster their staff with bigger tits and higher cheekbones so more people want to come.  Exponentially so since everyone is trapped alone and just needs a distraction so tossing off in the car while staring at the bouncing cheerleader serving your drink  is at an all time high.

The market is rallyling because there is no volume and there was a gamma flip.  But thats too complicated for you.
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre mooning. The reality is that if Trump loses a major key state (FL, GA, TX, etc) or Biden loses two of his (PA, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc), this thing is over tonight. Investors don‚Äôt want to be left behind.
Is 340 even out of the question at this point

Just went in on calls for this election. I believe in ‚ÄòMerica and I believe that we‚Äôll have a clear winner by the end of tonight. Regardless of the party that wins, I think the late votes won‚Äôt have enough of an effect to alter the election and Wall Street is going to rally tomorrow regardless of the outfall. Pressure will be relieved, we‚Äôre all gonna wake up tomorrow, and we‚Äôre all gonna have another day at work. Life will go on. Stonks only go up.
Lmao so many dead bears
How so? From what I have heard the markets appears to be pricing a Biden victory. Dollar is weaker across the board (big stimulus). Equities generally stronger (certain result) and 10 year bond yield is up (big stimulus).
bears be sweating
FUBO short squeeze?
As a wise man once said "it's already priced in"

So yesterday it was pricing in a Biden win. Today a trump win. What are y‚Äôall smokin ü§£

people are really optimistic on the outcome of the election I guess and want to "buy the dip"
K
They are getting fucked hard lmao
Thanks can‚Äôt wait for that honestly
The ecstatic bullish optimism here is concerning. This is a juice before a big sell off eod.
[deleted]
I can‚Äôt even think right now. Was not ready for this
https://youtu.be/U1mlCPMYtPk
Market is rallying because no volume, nobody is doing anything but wait for news to leak out. Good for those of you with calls but I‚Äôd be weary of doubling down
market acting like we‚Äôll have a winner by tonight. yah ok
That's already a given. I'd recommend you some shin or jin ramen though. Look for a korean market near you.
Which one? ü§°
It‚Äôs only at ~60 on 1hr and 50 on 4hr. 5m candles don‚Äôt matter.
Grindr
It is pricing in that we would eventually have a president? Lmao what do they think we're voting for? Best banana of 2020?
Sell puts on Thursday
The market would‚Äôve gone down if that were the case
Of course as soon as I buy Calls we dip üòÇüòÇ
Guys I had conversion therapy. I am no longer a üåàüêª
Yeah, I have no clue about the safety tests for it.
everything is backwords
Can you really call it investing if you just dumped gasoline on your wallet and tossed a match?
[removed]
Cannabis is not
You think it‚Äôs completely related to the ANT IPO?
Whoever wins we mooning
It priced in the depression in 2040 and now we are pricing in the first Chinese president of the United States of America due in 2044
Well okay. Stay strong friend. Consider selling puts at the bottom like I have been doing
Careful though. If Biden wins, Mitch can say ‚Äúno stimulus because Democrats cost too much‚Äù. No stimmy till January if that‚Äôs the case.
Did I for real time Amazon calls?! 3250 exp Friday
Calls?
Anyone else think this game is actually too easy? Wasn't this morning pretty obvious?
My portfolio is too tech, and I think it may get rotated out of after election if dems win....  But fk if I know any good non qqq names.
Oof this is gonna dump so hard if it does.. be careful boisüò≥
Just like 2016 when they talked the same and nothing happened?
Then why did SEDG get hammered while SPY shot up?
If Trump wins I will chop my own dick off.  Like I said it‚Äôs a mathematically impossibility.  This isn‚Äôt 2016 bruh, 93 million people have already spoken.
LUMN calls
Picked up some BABA calls at the bottom, see you on Singles Day Chyna
lol
Holding mine. Volatility won't arrive until tomorrow, if it arrives at all. 50/50
Dude they were insufferable.

I sold tqqq puts on Friday and bought them back Monday for 40% profit. 

But tbh even I didn‚Äôt think it was gonna be this green today. Thought green Monday and red or flat Tuesday.
You are going to lose your job
[deleted]
Bears r fuk
So tempted to sell covered calls but I need to have restraint. Not until tomorrow morning. The $450 in premium on assignment strike looks nice though....restraint.
I wish they weren't doing the generic case for display thing. I like to look at the art for games I don't normally know about and make random impulse buys based on the studio and case art. That's how I got into falcom games. We'll see how it plays out. This doesn't seem too popular but then again most nerds don't know what the fuck they actually want. I think they'll evolve with the feedback as time progresses.
I mean you could have called half of the stocks out there and have been right lol

With that said I‚Äôm a rkt believer :-)
VIX tracks volatility projected *over the next 30 days*, so naturally as we get closer to the catalyst and VIX gets farther from it ... science
Burning day trade even worth it when IV is this high? Won‚Äôt see any returns really
Fair enough.
‚ÄúAlright there Frankie....we‚Äôre here at Papa John‚Äôs‚Äù
So you don't know what short covering means. Or don't know the difference between that and hedging. FYI I exited my shorts (covered) them at 3233
It's obvious! It's a red day. Stocks 'll turn red any second now. Any second now
That‚Äôs me...
is PayPal run done?
lol SPY put/call ratio 1.48
I give up what kind
Right? Things keeps fucking going.
Why the fuck is baba keep stalling at exactly 289.00 on the dot? Wtf
Same
I thought it was supposed to be staircase up elevator down. Seems like it‚Äôs the opposite.
What if the earnings were contested by a lawsuit and dragged out for a few days?
Hope you retards bought baba calls at open. Biden wins, ANT IPO goes through, earnings, and singles day all around the same time. This was just a scam to let more Chinese billionaires load up üöÄ
Well the stock is going up in his defense, and their are a lot of people long on it
Sell solar calls now or wait?
entire sub goes bear for the election lmao
Should I sell my SPXS $6 calls
Looking at 2016, vix went up day after.  This election is even more contentious than that one, so again, I'd hold with a GTC limit sell order of what profits you're looking to hit, within reason.
[deleted]
Just bought calls, prepare the drill.
Lol. Hr fuked up!
Trump win mooning, why is all green otherwise?
Theta applies to elections, too. Trump has run out of time and is still OTM.

Cup and handle on the 3month. Might rip and breakout
No volume. Cash gang.
Market recalculating for a Trump win just like Nate Silver lol
This is bs. Polls were wrong in 2016. They‚Äôll be wrong today.
Same! I‚Äôve already accepted my 11/4‚Äôs expiring worthless üò™
Watch nothing happen after the results are called and we all get IV crushed tomorrow. MMs win again
Sounds right
So market is rallying because it‚Äôs predicting a trump win?
Trump leading New Hampshire by 6 votes. (26 votes in total)   2020 president confirmed?!?!?!
UVXY is for losers URTY FTW!!!
Watch as nothing happens in USA and stock market acts like retards to panic buy or sell.

Not true at all. Market values predictability and consistency.
Is there a reason why IPOB keeps dropping? Any news?
Polls haven't moved much in months. Bears- I'll buy puts. lmao
I work for an oil company. We make transportation fuels. It is important for us to assess and determine when hydrogen fuel cells (and battery too) trucks will be widely used because that impacts diesel demand. I run that analysis. Hydrogen is going to be very large. Plug is not a meme
Fuck it I‚Äôm buying 19.5 Uvxy calls expiring Friday watch me burn this cash
markets thinking Biden runs away with it. No way to contest, and stimmy coming shortly after.

Thats how I read this.

Of course they are going to pump the shit out of this market on the election day but it won't change the results.
Oh its still pumping cool
You know how hard it is to get fair-trade salamanders these dats?
Should I ask my SPXS calls $6 11/20
Had the same thought
[deleted]
Seriously? That‚Äôs pretty retarded.
Im with chu. I think good dip to buy.
The first hour of the market doesn‚Äôt mean shit. I‚Äôve literally seen it pump the first hour, bears are fuk, just for eod bulls are fuk.
Lol, you had to say it...

we are rising cause "no stimulus until after election" tomorrow is finally "after the election" lmao
Spy puts here
Could this be a move?
11/13 VXX calls down 30% today OOF
The problem is that he gambles with the rich. If he gambled with the poor, we could have had narrower class divide.
repented for my gaybear ways by closing out puts, luckily my PLUG $17 calls covered my ass
put holders.. what do we do
To fuck with everyone‚Äôs calls and puts. Why else?
SPY 350 EOD at this rate da fook
Everyone and their mother has been talking about a ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù happening since September. If you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs priced in, then I don‚Äôt know what to say...

Bears are straight clowns this morning. Love to see it
Should have gotten more BABA dip
It won‚Äôt. Everyone is hype at the sale. Slow bear
$CARTEL
It's less inflation and more the fact that it was a hell of a desperation deal. That is a 1928 Chrysler Imperial 75 Roadster, would have cost $1.5k new ($24k-ish today).  


And you didn't ask but since I know way too much about this picture, that is Walter Thorton. He retired a very rich man, and died in 1990.
[deleted]
We‚Äôre filling the gap above so we can drill the rest of the week. I dont trust this pump
I‚Äôm glad I have these baba calls instead of spy puts lol get fucked bears
 Baba dropped almost 8% and nov 6 put are barely 150% up. Is it IV drop or IV gain? I thought these options should be up 500-1000%
They don't even have a product. I heard they rolled the volatility down a hill to give it the appearance of motion
holy great mother of pumps
VIX going down. What does this mean? Less *uncertainty* on who will win the election?
It will. This is a bull trap imo
Correct
Richard Dawkins approves.

Wooo yea cheap puts I thought I missed out
I guess Europe doesn‚Äôt use Zoom?
So mad at myself for buying puts. 

Looking at how much we sold off in October I thought the smart move may actually be to buy calls... everyone is talking SellOff,... usually means it doesn‚Äôt happen. Why did I doubt my vibe...
Idiot bulls, dw they‚Äôll bleed tmm
The market apparently is pricing in the fact that we will eventually have a stimulus and a president, according to CNBC.

So that brings back the question, why the fucckkk did it sell off last week on stimulus and election?...
[deleted]
we'll see i guess.  i mean obviously you're not wrong but that doesn't mean that future growth potential isn't there.  leaps not fuds

TQQQ profit converts to SPXS
For all the people crying about volume and "WhO's BuYiNg??", just remember, SPY can go up on no volume. 

Bulls don't need volume to prove it - just look at all of 2017. Bears need volume to prove it.

It's not a fair game for Bears. Never has been, never will be.
I sold! Now I feel safe
Buy some stocks for companies you believe in. Then hold. Don‚Äôt touch it. You can‚Äôt grow a tree if you constantly dig up the seed.

Seems fitting bears get raped on Election Day
lol why did I even hedge.
Lol this fake PayPal pump. Short this all to the ground
Except Trump looks vibrant (did you see all his back to back rallies last night?) while Biden looks broken down in body, mind and spirit.  He will be a puppet dancing on strings.

Well done, this is way cooler than saying you have cash in your checking account.
Yes, the market is totally pricing in a Biden win, because literally so much has happened in the last 24 hours to shakeup the race.
Fisker literally makes **ZERO** money as it has **ZERO** sales because it has **ZERO** cars, but is a billion dollar business. This is why we can never make fun of stories like the tulip frenzy. Human stupidity and greed are everlasting.

Long gold, guys. You know it‚Äôs the play. At least 10% of the folio
WTF Corsair? Why?
** The meeting came after Mr Ma criticised China‚Äôs state-owned banks at a financial summit in Shanghai at the end of October. Jack Ma suggested the big banks had a ‚Äúpawnshop mentality** ‚Äù and that Ant was playing an important role in extending credit to innovative but collateral-poor companies and individuals.

At the same summit, however, Wang Qishan, China‚Äôs vice-president, emphasised the importance of financial stability. ‚ÄúThere should be a fine balance between encouraging financial innovation, invigorating the market, opening up the financial sector and building regulatory capacity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSafety always comes first.‚Äù

Before announcing the timing of the IPO, Ant executives met with PBoC officials this summer to seek their blessing, according to two senior group executives. Despite receiving assurances, there have long been voices sceptical of Ant within the PBoC and China‚Äôs banking and insurance regulator, which views itself as the champion of the country‚Äôs biggest lenders.

‚ÄúI've never seen an IPO suspended at this stage‚Äù said a director at one Shanghai-based brokerage, who described the decision to suspend Ant's dual listing as a ‚Äúvery last minute thing".

‚ÄúIt's in no one's interest to cancel the allocations at this stage,‚Äù the director added, ‚Äúbut I don't think there's any precedent for this type of situation.‚Äù

Why don't you like money that much? Just sell options instead of buying them.
Gave up on options heavily - gonna buy stock from now on and only dabble in options - would have been better off back when I started, I will be better off now.
I would be jumping on BABA so hard right now if I wasn‚Äôt already balls deep in it
We had a gold standard where we could redeem money for gold at the bank, but govt printed currency every chance it got. Lincoln created the "greenback" as a paper dollar to pay for the war. Wilson created the Fed and immediately started printing money. So while we had a gold standard, they still had inflation in the money supply, which is what caused the big crash before the Great Depression.

The Fed continued printing until the 1970s, when the other countries started calling for their gold to be redeemed, at which point Nixon abandoned the "gold standard", closed the exchange window, and told them all to get fucked. 

To learn more about how govt ruined our money and creates the ever increasing booms and busts, visit www.Mises.org :)

Calling someone like him rich just helps billionaires maintain that status quo. Let‚Äôs have some class solidarity instead of passive aggressively calling him rich because he can take off work for a couple years. He‚Äôs still a wage slave like most of us here. Drawing these arbitrary dividing lines helps nobody except those who are actually rich, not the chump working 60 hours a week to bring home 80k post tax if he‚Äôs lucky.
It would crash real bad if Jack Ma doesn't take CCP into confidence. No company can survive in China without CCP's blessings and Jack Ma just earned their wrath.

Getting pumped by retail buying the dip. Big money waiting for news to drop
Sell off is after Biden is announced winner. All big tech buyers take out their profits and sell shares massively to avoid Bidens high tax cuts

Ez calls bois. Ez calls.

Red candles are illegal apparently
Even Draftkings is up
ACB is kind of a penny stock joke but a Biden win would be great for the cannabis market. I think a few states like new jersey and south dakota have legalization on the ballots too. Although SD may not pass it. Calls on THCX are on my mind but I'm unsure
You know, with the extremely strange day ahead and the likelihood that nothing coming will make sense, you could've just as easily said "nah, fuck it" and taken a day off. But you didn't. Thanks for coming through, man.

Ban me then pussy or shut the fuck up
Its not doing anything.
Nows a good time to start hedging. MMs are gonna chop ur head off anytime
hmm, if only there was some world changing event between now and when your puts expire that might provoke instability and save them
Selling $30 puts is probably the smart move.  Buying OTM short-dated calls is the WSB move.

I have 1/2022 $10 leaps.  The greeks on it make it so it's basically the same as owning the stock with a bit of leverage.
That is extremely cheap. I don‚Äôt know much about these cars but that is a bargain

Speculation of a Biden win, he would be a lot less likely to retaliate with China than Trump.
Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in ceiling fan
spy calls printing
SPY RSI has stayed above 76 for over 23 mins now. Got it to pump up on this low volume. Looks like printers are back on boys.
50k/ month isn‚Äôt that much money. Sure, it‚Äôs very good but I‚Äôd certainly be pissed if I lost $300k in a year like this. This is like a years salary for your 50k/mo when you account for taxes.
I think my Robinhood account must have been hacked. I keep adding money in but my portfolio keeps dropping.
Loooooool u r fuk
Ok, but I'm up over 200% on LK. Kicking myself in the ass for not buying more of a fraudulent, bankrupt, shitty company.
Why did baba crash?
Cash out and re-invest your profits. C‚Äômon man
Yesterday market was pricing in Biden win now it looks like its swung into Trump win? Yesterday guns down weed up, today guns up weed down??
IV up on Green Day? What that mean??üßêüßêü§ì
I‚Äôve got an extra 1k to throw into the first decent play idea commented below
This, man some people are so retarded. When was oil the highest last? During Obama years, less supply means higher price. But people can only think in terms of ‚Äúthey took errr jobs‚Äù
Their competition on the world stage might be falling out of favor in China.  The Europoors are asking the US to be bffs again so they can afford the things they laugh at us for not having.  Today is great news for Bezos.

98% we don‚Äôt know who won for at least a week, probably longer and you silly bulls are out here buying calls. F

Should have gotten way more BABA dip I guess
Not even 1M volume on SPYs first candles. Something is gonna happen.
PYPL is up like 50% since COVID hit. If ya can't make money in this market, it ain't the market.
Congrats who got baba at dip. Fuck ccp
Dammit, my puts for 11/6 are gone.

Ok, sorta leaning bullish right now. I need a play and I have none. What is the play! NIo puts? SPY calls?
Guess we pump on nothing again

Seems a little flat during open hours right now though. I guess everyone has made their bets and hedges and is waiting to see what happens tonight/next couple of weeks maybe

Hmmm why are metals dumping? People selling off their hedges already?
Probably good to short SPY right now

Really but what did you have cause you at least lost 100k before that trade
Best way to learn lol
I sold my SPY puts at open. So SPY will die down later today. Down 60%. Give me some long dated calls. Is NIO that good?

We buying anything today or waiting until dust settles tomorrow? I‚Äôm eye fucking SEDG and BABA hard
I messed up this dip by a few days.  I bought too early and then ran out of cash to keep buying as the market kept dipping.  Even with all that, I ended up printing money if we stay at current levels.

If this market is truly coiled to go to 360 on the SPY then I am well positioned and wish I had more cash to invest.
Oh shit someone got carried out pre-market. Look at SI, poor guy got filled at $29. Market price is $23.
Well I'm not seeing a lot of buying or selling pressure right now. The calm before the storm maybe
Yea same. I dont see a retarded valuation run up, but 20% LEAPs are a good play.

Bro fuck this shit
Its not about candidates, its about the senate. 

Right now dem sweep = good for stimulus and covid prospects. 

Dems holding house is near assured, president is very likely biden. Senate needs 3/7 tossup seats to go blue for dem majority. 

If you think the dems will sweep, todays uptick will continue. If republicans hold the house buy puts because todays market hype falls flat.
Yes WMT is definitely going to go up until it doesn't anymore, at which point it will go down
rug pull at 336
Moron. Why tf would you pick ACB. If you picked CRON or CGC I'd be hoping you make money. ACB?! I hope you lose every dime you wasted on that shit
If Biden is winning how come Oil is up like 10% in a week?
It‚Äôs been under performing the market for the last 4 months even when it‚Äôs been performing at its best. What makes people think winter holidays will be any different. People know it‚Äôs going to do well in the holidays. At this point what‚Äôs going to break it up higher? Not sure
If SPY doesn‚Äôt start tanking within 20minutes definitely buying puts...same pattern as yesterday....
What time SPY going negative?  You know it‚Äôs coming

Do we really need to wait for tomorrow for INTC to die?
AMZN is refusing to go with the flow
It's the expectation that the election will be over soon
The market will shift. Volatility will impact the S&P/DJIA. No matter who wins, you'll see the volatility. This is a good buying time as the value of stocks won't change but their price will.
My bills are like 5k a month lmao its not hard to sell a $20 product to 1000 people every month with a few diff products üòÇ

Buy high, sell low
What did I do to deserve this
Third down, VIX looking, pumps once, fires across the middle and he's lucky that one isn't picked off. So they'll have to punt it here and not a very encouraging first drive for Michael VIX, we'll see if they can make some adjustments to get him more comfortable on the next series

why is DKNG and MGM doing so well? Virus cancelled?
Lol You Know how I know this market is fake and gay? SPY RSI since open has stayed above 76 for 15 mins straight.

Why is JD tanking? Just cause it is Chinese and linked to BABA??
Every day I look at AMZN to make myself feel better about selling it when it was 3400.

It was the Biden worker that caused the accident in Texas

Lol this is the third time the dip has convinced this whole subreddit the market is crashing. We got June 11th, September 3rd, and now October 26th. I guess the CEO of SPY can‚Äôt pay out all of those puts.
BABA eventual dump after earnings is gonna a great buying opportunity
Biden will fix baba
Op must be a mega douche. Could you radiate enough small dick energy?
So we back to full bull or still bear/cash gang?
Welp SPY put did not turn out well at all. I sold a put to reduce the loss a little but that kinda hurts

I think it‚Äôs just the institutions that trade it with each other mostly. Activision made a ton of money this year and will continue to do so next year with all this stay at home order, yet the stock looks like it‚Äôs purposely kept  low
Sold outta my tsla calls early but I‚Äôll take the 250%
Guys I don‚Äôt think we are going to crash anymore
the difference is that this is still 300k we are talking about. and unless you are 100% certain that you have guaranteed job security for the next decade it is probably not a good idea to set that much money on fire
Weird flex but ok üëå
Plus American. Big if Biden win
I think we hit 450 by friday if Biden wins cause he likes EVs :)
My risk management practice is going well yet somehow I just yolod hard into ACB. Oh well let‚Äôs go, weed!
I like it
BABA callsüëÄ
Right now tbh Americans just woke up
I remember reading something like 90% of millionaires don't consider themselves to be rich. People tend to move goal posts on themselves because it's easy to look up at the guy above you and realize the gap. People rarely compare themselves downward.

CVS gang checking in.
That Ant news really fucked them
You‚Äôre right, if this is the Great Depression Era. $1500 now won‚Äôt get you a reliable car these days. Not only are the feds to blame, but also the automotive industry, tech industry, and the manufacturing industry inflating their prices too. The only thing that has really stayed with inflation or below is the price of oil/gas.
He should have went long on that Roadster. They're worth upwards of $200k today.
Jack himself? Chinese government?

Largest IPO fraud ever happening this morning and it's part of the largest publicly traded company in China and 5th most valuable company in the world and the world markets are gonna be like

"I'm gong to ignore this is happening"
I agree but it seems so obvious I have a feeling it‚Äôll just hover right around where it is all day just to fuck with people
They‚Äôre different people?
BLEED APPLE BLEEEEEEEEEEEEED WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS RETARDED BULL SHIT
Tomorrow is the biggest stock market crash in the history of November 4th 2020 crashes
I hope, holding 75 shares of that crap at 230 and was feeling pretty good about it.
Electronics and all the fancy safety shit cars have now make them hella expensive.

Whats the difference between this and a normal person losing 10k in the market? Lol
Either moon or drill already
If you're gonna buy 100 shares of TSLA when the time is right your gonna need a souped up DeLorean and the help of Christopher Lloyd
Second rip tomorrow maybe after profit taking?

This shit is moving sideways
Was watching nio at 2$ hahaha and then I saw it 1 week ago almost 40 üòÇüòÇ
GME most obvious dip to buy
50K a month pretty great, what do you do ?
I truly hope there are no riots if trump wins because they have 100% 1000% 10,000%  not priced in the fact the cops were waiting to see if he would win before they started shooting back for real. Just saying
Is this the beginning of the next rally?

If you put Jim Cramer and Louis C.K in a room, I would not be able to identify who is who
That would have to be a long hold to go back to the green.
Once Again theta Gang has won
ATVI sucks so much. Glad i bought puts on this bitch. Everyone under the sun says to buy it. Yet it still goes down. Love the company but it‚Äôs 93% institutionaly owned which means it‚Äôs being dumped. Don‚Äôt be duped by the analysts go with the trend and flush this shit at least let the MMs pay you on the way out

BABA TO 250
Net at open would have been the move
buy spy puts
i dunno...tough one, this may be last day ever that tsla sees 400s....
This just rattled me haha. I had to look up their stock because I refused to believe they could possibly still be in business and listed. Wild. Good luck bro. That business is doomed for sure.
No, Q4 might be different though. Revenue from the consoles and Microsoft agreement can boost stock price. The intrinsic value to GME stock price is stupid low right now
Bruh! Why not?

When we buying back into BABA? This may be a life changing opportunity
Haha it's probably not that big of a deal. Criticising the executive branch of the Chinky government is where the execution starts.
Dude dw, at the risk of jinxing shit I think March 4th (or for that matter, Oct 13th, 1987) is a pretty useful guide to understand the volatile up moves across the market today
I think the smart money is betting on a Biden win and that would be good for the market
üòÇ it means no one is interested in buying your shitty contracts.
We really are living in a meme
My secret is that I'm a retard ü•¥
Who is still selling BABA at -9%, fuck
So here's VIX on first and 10, flushed out of the pocket, nowhere to go and he throws this one away. They got to him with the pass rush and there was just nowhere to go with that one

Waiting with bated breath on what the initial hype bots have to say about it. 

Will the manufacturing advantages of being designed by a 3 year old still be in play?

Will the addition of rear view mirrors ruin the asthetic? 

Will actual windows that can withstand a gently thrown rock increase costs too much?

dude its hilarious how wsb actually turned bearish at the right time, BUT so many got greedy and cocky. some dude yesterday said the market makers set up a perfect put play for us. not even what a market maker does :D :D

it was obvious vix at 40 was peaking, people were short vol, us economy is recovering. election uncertainity can only do so much... and many people were right to call fear sentiment dropping the markets, but long term december or even 11/20 calls are gonna win.

Oof thank god I sold out of my BABA calls last week. Those things would be worthless today

I don‚Äôt even know how I got there tbh I think I was watching JRE with Alex Jones and they were talking about it there, then I watched a Trump speech at the WEF and I went through the WEF upload history and just saw that they are openly advocating for a great reset

Unless I‚Äôm overlooking something, a fracking ban would drive up the cost of oil and thus the stock value of those surviving companies. Plus, Biden isn‚Äôt going to do anything drastic like that. Oil is needed and cheap oil makes the populace happy.

Oil has tanked forever under Trump. The market is assuming the following: Conditions are so friendly to Oil right now that supply is too high and it's too easy to produce. Biden's combo of tightening regulations and also huge spending on infrastructure could trigger both a decrease in supply and increase in demand, leading to rising oil prices.. very good for the likes of XOM and co.

Actually, that was my plan- I have been buying my calls during or right after earnings calls/drops. Made out like a bandit on Netflix calls I bought during the earnings calls tank, and then sold them later that day when they announced the price hike and jumped back up. I tried to dump FLWS yesterday at market open but couldn‚Äôt unload before it dropped

Oil is ready for a rebound, forward thinking into next summer after vaccine. Q4 will see production cuts and industry pullback sending WTI up a bit. I'm guessing sustainable $50+ after late winter
Yeah exactly. I was so worried, it felt like the dream lasted forever too. It was awful
if it dips to 154 im buying with everything i have

I have no idea what to do with my January aapl calls.....
Are y‚Äôall retarded? We‚Äôre so green why would spy calls be fucked?
Buying baba calls or puts for earnings now?
load up on cannabis! it‚Äôs gonna crash eod
Did you get that panicked feeling "oh shit, I'm going to prison forever."

That's how mine go and they suck.
Ma has been summoned by regulators
what just happened to me
She looks like an anti vax kid who got polio as a baby
Anyone ready to trust DKNG again? Maryland and South Dakota have sports betting on ballot and earnings are next week.
Yea, Walmart was the local shop killer in the same way that Amazon is the Big Box killer. 

But given the crap quality counterfeits and review mills, people are slowly going back to local shops (or etsy, etc), homegrown quality, DIY goods. 

Full circle.

Markets pumped all night and people are gonna take profits early on today. Question is do we recover after that or keep on selling?

In my experience it tastes better,  a vast improvement in freshness. Little extra kick in the go button as well. My garden also likes it as food to begin the year.

C'mon AMD. Today might be the day. It better be. Fucking Lisa couldn't wait a week for this to run up more before announcing mergers. ü§¨
Where is bottom for PYPL from here? The 100 SMA has been solid support over the past few months, but it blasted through that in overnight trading. 200 SMA at $154 or so next?
Popping 1%+ at open. Big buying today, the dip was last week
[deleted]
Market is going to be flat/slightly gain today. Tonight and tomorrow it will pump. Rest of the week will pump too

Market just wants to know who's going to be the next president and we will find out tonight (keep dreaming those of you who want it to be contested)
Good call. My calls are getting fuk right now but I expect things to change today.
buy stocks
Risked A LOT in the beginning (almost my whole net worth back then, $7k) but after I touched 6 figures, I decided to only play stocks and utilize margin instead of options so it would be more forgiving to take paper losses; not to mention, no theta decay/IV crush and the ability to sell covered options to recoup premium during flat weeks/months.
we all know Biden doesn‚Äôt have that kinda strength anymore
Nothing is guaranteed, but that sounds like a good risky play
My ears
Waste of money too, you are technically behind because of inflation and jpowpowpowrightinthekisser

Should have sold Monday.  Buy spy calls on open
It was because the retard talked about his ant shit was better than the government. How slow and bad the government banks are. Fucking retarded fuck. He fucked me too while fucking himself
Should I dump my AAPL calls that I'm slightly up on this morning and buy more weed calls? No idea what tech is going to do.
Printing bigly
This place has gone soft.

Really hope the market tanks so my UVXY calls will print, DFEN will tank, and I can load up on more cheap shares
[deleted]
I have money but will probably sit this out. No clue what to buy. Averaged down on a bunch of positions.

Edit: AMD still attractive though. March calls?
I view DKNG and CGC as having essentially the same EPS opportunities moving forward, maybe a slight edge to DKNG due to current # of competitors.

but DKNG is at ~14.5 billion market cap, and CGC is near 7 billion. 

one or more likely both of these stonks are quite mispriced.
Yeah 29 break even.
What do you own?
Literally a coin flip
No. Only for political bearshit
Should have sold Monday
Omg I just had a nightmare that I killed someone in my sleep. You have no idea how relieved I'm that if was only a dream...
In my darkest hours I think of that clip and chuckle
Welcome home
Oil seems to be the most pure play on the election. Biden winning would be terrible for the industry.
haha yeah man this stuff is a pain in the ass. Take it from me, just like everyone here I've gained and lost.  I believe what will happen is if you sell covered calls with your shares as collateral, for example, is if the sale strike price hits you'll lose the shares at the price you sold the options for. So basically someone gets them on sale and you're out the shares.  You have 100 shares of Apple, sell an option for $125 and the stock hits $130, you lose the shares for $125 to the person that bought your option.

Theta is the fucking devil. It's a fact of life. I like holding most of my options with at least a month or two before expiration so I can have some type of advantage on Theta but it ain't much... I try to only "yolo" weeklies with a small amount just for fun to see if something hits but it's a small % of my gambling portfolio.

It was a good run
Fucking hell this guy called it
Should I sell my UVXY weeklies by EOD today or hold them?
Invest directly in ANT after it ipo's or just get BABA?
I know
You'd think robots make this shit cheap

You forgot to add the upcoming million-dollar inheritance.
Thanks for the work.  üôèüèº

CRON, CGC, TLRY, and ACB and any other weed stock you can think of are gonna ride out like its earnings
Yeah, the market will generally care a lot more about control of Congress because that's where actual policy is made that can impact markets

good bot. What a neat concept.

Look at break even on expiry - that factors in for the total price of the option and how much intrinsic value needs to be built to match the price of the option.
What are the ticker symbols for the spread and your iron stuff?
it didnt even destroy earnings like that tho...not like paypal and them, people just thought wayfair was dead and it happened to meet expectations

Okay, so does this mean that it'll hit $100 by EOB today? Great, i'm in, 1st thing in the morning!
What do you watch?
Because oil is still needed for everything. Airlines are getting busier, ships still need it. Countries (Saudis, Iraqis, etc.) highly rely on it for their budgets and they won‚Äôt let it collapse. They would rather go to war over it.
FOMO. Buy some TSLA calls or something dude

Yup... TSLA.

If baba make it back to $300 today I‚Äôll be fine...

Not in debt. And potentially about to have a windfall due to cashing out another investment. But this is good advice and it‚Äôs always a good reminder.

did you risk alot or did you start small?
Hi all, just a quick note to say if you base your plays solely on what people say on this board then you deserve to be inaugurated as Trumps bidet. He likes high pressure so I suggest you start working on your water blowing technique you sack of retards. 

The only certainty in this pandemic is that people will die, airlines are fucked and the high quality chinese stocks will always weather the storm. Never forget to wash your asses folks. New findings have come out that people that only wipe with paper are 500000% more likely to not get their assholes eaten more than once by the same person. Hope this helps. 

If I were you I would wire transfer me all of your money so I can make your parents proud, then I will build a school to educate your children as to why their parents were such idiots and lost their college tuition listening to some fuds on a sub reddit instead of actually learning and making their own fucking decisions. 

Oh and it goes without saying... Gold and silver will reach all time highs following new stimulus. Instead of burning your money in shit stocks, make some metal plays whilst listening to enter sandman before crying yourself to sleep tonight fuckos.

only thing you need to do today is buy any calls at 11:29am est. and sell for 3x on friday
I'm just worried that it's doing this on the thoughts that Harris/Biden wins, which won't happen.

Better to be prepared. You can always give it to the homeless or a shelter if nothing happens
They just suspended the ANT IPO, which BABA owned 33% of
Oh. Makes sense now
I'm sorry to hear that.  :(  You gotta look at the whole trend.  Almost every big company is dropping even after earnings.  Don't be too stubborn and follow the trend.  I've place put spreads in the last 2 weeks and have made some money despite the selloff.
Because its market cap is so low we could buy the whole company with the loose change in our cars. That makes a stock price bouncy.
Reverse this genius
[deleted]
Your posts are genuinely so helpful.
Where‚Äôs the drill?????
No. What is the market cap if you used the ask instead of the bid for the market cap?
If you hate money

I believe Baba owns 30% of ANT. On a $30B valuation that‚Äôs about $10B worth of equity they thought they‚Äôd have that they no longer do

What happend to Solaredge?
BABA
It‚Äôs not about governors reactions as a whole. Whitmer did some weird things that were unique to her response, like banning the purchase of seeds and home construction equipment. Not letting people go to their vacation homes that they pay taxes on. 

Just some odd shit that was 100% unconstitutional. People don‚Äôt want to be told ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt grow vegetables during a food shortage‚Äù
We're selling off at open, right?
Did you buy into SNOW ipo too?
You had entire week last week. Wtf?!
Poots are expensive right now. I can see someone buying today and still losing somehow.
Currently bag holding 30 13.5 puts im somehow down on?

WSB: Don't Invest in China stocks because they have no regulation and all the companies are full of fraud!

Also WSB: Don't invest in China stocks because regulators are warning ANT/Baba founder that there will be more regulations applied - see that shows they are frauds!

Edit: Also WSB right now - Invest in China Stocks because of Biden!
I haven‚Äôt been this anxious for a market day in a minute
If you're looking for a serious answer- propaganda. Biden ain't seizing the means of production, bro
asians too.

Press F for all the VIX call holders
Die
Guilty of this my self. Shit feels so bad, seeing your ticker skyrocket after buying puts hurts so much :(
They know the truth about communism
so what happened to baba
Yes, you were correct to hesitate
Because too many people went short last week. Thats the only reason we going up rn
You overestimate how much effort people are willing put into fact finding
When they say they don't care about them it means that if you fall short on one or a few of them it's okay. They don't mean they rank short, broke limp dick higher than 6ft rich dude. 

They're basically looking for something beyond those 'basic" things a few of which you can lose out on

Their govt's give them stimulus.  Lockdown is easy to shrug off when you still make like 80% of your wage.
It's like IV crush, there's only a few days of serious uncertainty left and as nothing happens stocks go back up.

This is the event and if it goes over without any massive fuckups, which is pretty likely, then stocks will rise - even regardless of who wins.

XOM put a green month on the board with red crude and red indexes. It really might have bottomed out.
Gold is manipulated so much. I had calls for GLD and was making $2000 profit when this stimulus discussion started. I ended up selling my calls making $50. Good thing because I would have lost money if I hadn‚Äôt sold it.
Guys. Do you not read the articles filtered to your picks? Or watch any news? Don‚Äôt ask why BABA is down. If you can read this, I believe in your abilities to read elsewhere.

That baba news was a fucked up way to start the morning
How would that relate to shanghai exchanges? I realize you can buy baba or an etf that may wind up with exposure. But you‚Äôd have to have an international brokerage account to get ant stock direct.

If you think the polls are way off and Trump is close enough to drag things out but not so clearly ahead that Biden concedes early, then sure. Seems like a tight needle to thread at this point.
Oof. Your going to regret that
Instead of buying puts, get a $100 haircut at a nice barber shop, maybe that‚Äôll help üòÅ

Ok listen up, because I don‚Äôt give ideas often. AMC is currently at $2.46 a share meaning it‚Äôs market cap is like $235 million. If we all pitch in $300 we can do a **WSBs hostile takeover** of the movie theater chain. We can all take turns being CEO for a week, get free popcorn, and bang lots of sloots.. because, you know, we own the place

Ant IPO is being suspended, and BABA jus= dropped 6% pre market.
Anyone playing VFF? Decent volume and a little more under the radar than some of the others. Earnings on the  12th, RH strikes start the 20th so it has some idiot proofing built in.
stop reposting this

At this point why would I sell any of my puts down 50% already... I‚Äôm gonna hold all 200:) rip

I've got a couple dozen shares of Cronos I bought a couple of years ago when I started my RH account with lunch money. Mostly as a meme, I bought most of the shares on 4/20 at $6.90.

It went up to twenty-something not long after that. Probably should have sold, but I wanted the meme to live on in my account.
Was thinking the same but damn, Gyna can be hard on stocks and BABA might have more room to fall here.

So. Regulators don‚Äôt like baba and ant because of the government backed banks. Potential bailouts if the economy dumps. Other than their government overreaching a smidge, do they know something? Or are they upset people are going through them and they are taking over the industry, away from government banks.
Wayfair such a cuck. 13% to almost red. Rip my call
Fuck yeah this is a blessing. I have diagonal calls I can buy back for pennies. Hopefully it‚Äôs back over 290 by next week. But yeah I‚Äôll be buying leaps at open if price is right.

lol yeah remember when Trump said he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and his retard supporters would still support him and he was right and then we made him president by the thinnest margin in electoral history during a global moment of rising nationalism and at a time of deep economic inequality.

Todays market makes me nervous, definitely the kinda day that can make or break fortunes easily
lol are you Disturbed about it
What kind of money are you trading with though? 1.5% fee there and back, adds up a lot. Even with just 1k, you spend 15$ commision, and assuming price doesnt change, you pay another 15$ when you sell. THat's expensive. I think it's only worth it if your maybe playing with like under 300$ or something.

In the past election day has been slightly green and the day after is red, but 2020 has shown that anything can happen.

Buy put +289
europe is bullish that they are about to replace the US in economic status
If you can hold off until the afternoon, I'm thinking you might find a better opportunity. Its what I plan on doing at least. I figured I'll either get discounted puts, or maybe I dump my cash into a bargain stock and look away for a couple weeks lol
the way it looks contested elections are not priced in at all
It‚Äôs only bullish because market priced in worst case scenario last week and now it‚Äôs not looking like the election will be close.
All in on nuggets. Even the margin.
Fairish but I believe there is no debate who among these two has the least control over English
Downvote if u bagholding
Is tomorrow the day to go all in on tech? I've been 95% cash for the last month, champing at the bit to get back in to something other than pot lotto tickets

Anyone else buy Corsair in the last couple minutes before close yesterday?

Shit that feels good
Buying calls at the top and buying puts at the bottom. Name a more iconic duo.
The only sure thing in this market is that gme is at the bottom of it's channel with consoles about to drop and still 100% shorted. Don't know why you'd buy anything else rn.
I'm not clear on Boogaloo.

Is it bullish or bearish?
This erection is a super spreader event and we see significant hospitalizations and deaths in three weeks
Did you play them?
What I‚Äôm saying though is that the uncertainty hasn‚Äôt changed at all since last week.
Have you tried Big Cuck? Maybe something a little more clever like, Cuckie Cheese
MMs are doing their job if you feel like that. Also never go too heavy on the spy puts easy way to blow up an account
Perhaps market is assuming a landslide instead of contested?

I usually buy in quantites of 5 contracts. I day trade 0DTE spy options so I maybe buy 2 a day. Having 5 contracts each so the commision is $29.90 in total, the price of the SPY puts only need to move 7 cents for me to profit. It forces you to be sure that your confident in your trade, because even if you sell at the price you bought at, your down 30$. It fucking sucks. I am trying to get a job in the states (border city), so I can get a visa and get american brokerage. You guys got it easy.
No nut November. We doomed.
If we go higher in the next few days and end the week higher, then I can almost guarantee we‚Äôll see ATHs in November.
U can sell a put spread, if your account allows. OTM or ATM

It's the uncertainty of who will win, as it could dramatically affect the market moving forward. Some may not want to make a play until things shake out. Either way, it's an uncertain future with two potentially wildly different outcomes.
Tell me why i dont go al in on baba 400 leaps mid 2021
On my knees for FB 270
Soon enough we will vote with phones, don't worry. The technology is already here, it's just being used on shitcoin at the moment

Sometimes life gives you one. I regretted dumping my BABA calls for MSFT two days ago. MSFT March calls may not be ideal, but at least they aren't tanking 8% in the premarket...

Thank you Saint. Elon, Patron Saint of Degeneracy and Retardation.

Is this the fabled bull trap?
How do you set this up? Do you buy/sell call or buy/sell puts?

Baba is love
I don‚Äôt care about Europe bro
Canada reporting. I sure do. Got almost 2lbs this year and it‚Äôs very very good. I am giving it away to friends. I have more than I will ever use in a year.
I was all set to come out the closet and throw everything into spy puts today but now I‚Äôm having second thoughts..
fuck this guy what a pussy
What a genius
No, just cash. Credit spreads, iron condors, calendar spreads, and butterflies.

This shit was so easy in August
U from the fyuchur!?
[deleted]
I‚Äôve heard this before. Can you explain how gamma will mess me up?
I think they'll all pump today/after hours but one that seems a little more under the radar is VFF.

The general sentiment is that they're a a strong company with good management unlike ACB etc. Also has reasonable volume (&gt; 1M avg) 

They have earnings in the 12th, and the earliest strike on RH is the 20th which forces you to not dive into risky weeklies.

I have some ACB $5 calls that are up 300 percent even though they're a shitty company, but mostly because they're heavily shorted.

I'll probably look into VGG $6C for the 20th as a gamble play.
Oh, so you're not like a wsb retard, you're like a real *retarded* retard?
Yeah it‚Äôs almost as if the market doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the beer virus anymore. ü§î
Who's got UBER puts?  Doesn't look like prop whatever will pass.
You aren‚Äôt very intelligent
Where can I bet on the election?
U short or long?
Puts on my puts
Sounds like what bears were saying in early April.
I would stay away from CGC (and perhaps the whole sector other than day trades) only because earnings are Nov 9, and they could shit the bed
Fanta was the top beverage choice of the nazi party (not even joking)
"MAGA 202020 don't forget that!"
Yea I'm surprised condescending as fuck clickbait makes it passed editorial, its like they want to get shat on and become irrelevant.
Puts for the win. But....I don‚Äôt have any. May be calls for the ride up.
Yeah I‚Äôve gone full kang gang this past weeks cuz permabull was killing me
It's not a Tesla; it's worthless.
When do we know about the Senate? Is that tonight or will that be contested?
Mississippi
Most polls had Hillary with a 70-80% of winning in 2016.  The polls were not "wrong," just the less likely scenario won.  Don't forget Hillary dominated the popular vote and Trump won by tens of thousands of votes in just a few states.
And which candidate are we talking about here?
BABA LOL
all you have been spewing here is politics, do you even have positions? or are you just here to praise your orange god, this is a casino, not fox news
Or over 290 lmao
Most other developed countries in the world vote through mail retard.

It's not that complicated.
Tech is dead.
Urban shops closing up shop and Peet‚Äôs is kicking their ass in grocery stores.
Buy the brands selling the final product not the grower. That‚Äôs like instead of buying Starbucks, buying their bean grower
By what?
Next couple months, you'll  be like I should have bought at 34 when it at 60
Mango is Big Dump.  I hear he wears diapers lol.
My prediction? PAIN

Thanks Bae! üòò
depends on which side you're on.  I'm balls deep in puts and I'm just pissed rn, not gonna lie...
Whoops
BABA leaps at open? Will never see it back under 290 again imo
Tomorrow regardless who wins would be the biggest sell the news event ever
GME gang reporting in. Asshole is raw spirits are neutral.
If I were you I‚Äôd hold the calls tho. We can get volatility tomorrow depending on the result.

Cheers fellas. Today will be an interesting day for the markets and for democracy. I wish you all the best.
Who bought baba yesterday? Show yourselves.
I disagree, I‚Äôm even a trump supporter myself but I‚Äôll never hate someone just Bc they support Biden

Less negotiations done over rage tweeting

at the end of the day

"futures were higher as investors weighed a host... actually lets cut the bullshit, they're higher because the printing press has been on fire for the last 6 months, and the USD is now essentially monopoly money and nothing fukken matters anymore"

however they cant say this because they will go bankrupt due to lack of headlines for the next 10 years
I never understood this. What exactly is "voter intimidation"? Some one saying "hey you better vote A!" ....like okay. They will have no idea who you voted for for.
When people realize Jack Ma‚Äôs new IPO not getting listed has nothing to d with BABA ü§°
You can buy jewelry?
You mean that convoy that safely escorted Biden? Being gentlemen and protecting the completion is what I saw. Didn‚Äôt see anyone get run off the road
No one is excited about shares man especially 5k worth of shares. Maybe if it‚Äôs 5,000 BABA shares ... shares are long term
I will be buying shares today
BABA broke my heart
What the fuck just happened to BABA?!?

Maybe because this is not r/conservative here, it‚Äôs like me going to r/weebs and spamming my hardcore midget porn, no one gives a fuk.
Remember when bears swore they had this in the bag. Imagine basing your own whole investment thesis on Dony throwing a temper tantrum, then not selling when you had a chance. The show must go on
I'm just being a scared bitch TBH, not down 100% yet but this gap up has me worried...
Bruh mail in ballots sound so unsafe, how is this still a thing in the modern world? Can't we vote via google form
Futures are addicting as shit to watch.
This did not age well.
yeah but is a recovery likely in the future?
You need to have the capital if it gets exercised. 

Or go margin like a pimp.
no just cash to cover buying those shares
I've been a die hard CRLBF fan. No options and can't trade them on robinhood but they will rule the legal market in due time.

What does this mean about polls if they end up being wrong again today? Do we just throw the whole industry in the trash?
Long term here is 2 weeks out
fuck that's a gross ass color but i kind like it 

what is that packered stale urine yellow?
Fuck me. I guess I‚Äôm in too.
I did yesterday. Should have sold before earnings
My puts are up from yesterday lol. Like printing. Maybe not today but shiddd yesterday them mfers printed.
Eh I think I‚Äôm just gonna get out of nio at open
basically what I did. A lot of the cash I manage is just in VOO, since it will pretty much outperform everything going forward in the next 7 years. Lucky for my family I can't buy options on vanguard and just fuck myself daily, while I watch my brother's 529 outperform me by 60%.
Sorry not when the choice can't complete english sentences. You don't have my respect. You have my sympathy because you are getting like 15% of the big picture.
really?
Omg its that price for buying AND selling? I was thinking with that cost buying and selling would be included. How many contracts do you trade a week usually?

If you aren‚Äôt selling and collecting these sweet ass premiums this week then idk what to tell you.
$Spy $322 P expiration 11/4
Yep. One contract will cost you around 22$ just in commision after you buy/sell. It's fked. If you pay 90$ a month though you get a "reduced" commision I believe its 6.95$ plus 0.75$ a contract.
It's the opposite in a lot of places. Country is facing extreme polarization.
Fuk you only stick with canadian stocks bud?
We are sitting right at 200 Days moving average.   Either we gonna drill or go to the moon.  Buckle up

I have heard liberal economists argue against the corporate tax. It makes more sense to tax people. With a corporate tax small shareholders pay the same tax rate as billionaires. Not sure they will raise the corporate tax rate. Capital gains...

If I buy puts it will be after 2-3 retard puts because there is always a fake small pump.

Lol. Profit taking? Who the hell is taking profit off a 1% day following a major sell off last week. We‚Äôre still well of the highs. People are buying and big money has been buying since last week.

Where is all the bearish comments listing their 15 reasons why the market is down at??
üêÇ gang now ü¶ß gang
Why TF wayfair cuck? 290 to 270 just like that
he will payoff a driver with liquor
Nothing is actually going to happen today.  Fireworks start tomorrow.  Keep eyes peeled for Biden win with a republican senate.  That‚Äôs the most bearish outcome imo
Advantage of US is stable infrastructure. A reliable president will be good for stocks.
Yes, just saw on Twitter
I used to work construction in the SF Bay Area. A guy in Pac Heights bought a house and then bought the house behind his house, then leveled that house because it was blocking his view. That‚Äôs FYM to me. Or I‚Äôve been on jobs where the homeowners pay $2500 in utilities alone and that‚Äôs FYM for sure
Make it 10% instead of 15%
Why come to Reddit to just post Tweets?

Was a bit grumpy last night. Earnings puts might not be the worst idea. Rest of November this stock will move like a fat girl on an ice rink... but like in the opposite direction.
I‚Äôm bag holding. Their call was bullish as fuck so I‚Äôm hopeful
Bruh your sense of money has is gonna be fucked from early
I live in SF. Whole city feels like one big dorm room. No one wants settle down there. Everyone wants to get out once they make enough money, start their own thing, till remote work is the norm etc., Very shallow conversations, too many men, tech on every billboard, filthy, too many rich assholes ... the list just goes on.

Edit: I read in someone's comment here on reddit who works at a bank. His manager was told from higher up that they were to NOT have any mortgages marked as delinquent in their Q3 reports or something. He could have been full of shit, but they made it sound like they were kicking the proverbial can into next year and next presidency.

herd immunity was the only shot we ever had but no one could say it out loud until after they get reelected, if they say it outloud the old people who voted them in will vote them out

fuck the aarp

American democracy is a fucking joke, just a bunch of fat illiterate facebook group users and old people freaked out medicare people (6 decades to get your shit together during the biggest period of financial growth in recorded human history, and you couldn't do it?)

at the time of the revolution America was the most literate nation on earth, more newspapers and magazines were sold per capita than anywhere else on earth, by far. Discussing these papers and shit was all they could do, because no tv or reddit.

now its just retards hyping retards hyping retards off some Instagram comment they read about how mango man is bad because he hurts feelings

gotta edit this again to just say fuck old people, get the fuck out of the way, stop voting for your own financial self interest when you have 4 more years to live anyway fuck you

im glad they were mean to memaw at the nursing home she was a bitch for giving everyone else double the trust fund. i stopped doing heroin anyway so fuck you lady

and the deaths dont mean shit, on the macro level. Its the ones that dont produce anymore, or never produced that are dying. until we hit enough deaths that hospitals are fucked ( we have a lot of room to go in tx), any reporting is just fear mongering to the groups i discussed in the ramblings above.

No.
Imagine if Trump brought out Big Pump instead. Even this lil pump was enough to torpedo me though.
you'll just cap your gains at whatever strike you sell + the premium you sold the calls for... so no, you cant lose more than your current investment, in fact its safer than just outright owning shares
If you think anyone is holding much through tonight I got another thing coming for ya

I'm 12 and who is mango
I‚Äôm glad you can admit it. You said you live in the Midwest.
No one's talking about the corporate tax rate going back up to 28% under a Biden victory.  Also corporate tax on revenue instead of profit to reduce offshore tax avoidance.

Only way the market going back to stonks only go up is if Biden wins but Senate remains republican, blocking all policy changes.  Under this condition it's safe to continue buying all the dips.

Under a Biden victory and Democrats winning Senate majority, I'd sell any after election rally and buckle up.

Also if the results are contested, take a look at the drawn out Bush recounts in Florida...
Doesn't matter if Trump or Biden wins, it just depends on the senate. A red senate will likely keep kicking the can down the road.

All those companies are unsustainable cash furnaces. Piss thru crazy amounts of cash and can‚Äôt post profits
You are begging though.  Not sure why you can‚Äôt see it.  Picture yourself as a bond, you‚Äôre like a 0% beyond garbage grade bond.  It‚Äôs total begging.  You could literally take our money, not use it on college, and just ignore us, no shits given.  There‚Äôs no guarantee, legal agreements be damned.  If you have no assets and live in another country, how do I get my money that you already spent from you?  


Almost every student takes low interest loans to get an education?  Why should you be so special?  Odds are you won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt pay us back in 5 years anyway.  Since you start in 2021, you‚Äôll graduate in 2025.  How will you earn $120,000 post tax in half a year?  Which degree are you getting?  Which degree gives you a guaranteed job with a entry level salary of low-mid six figures?  How do you guarantee stock income? 


Lastly, there‚Äôs a subreddit for borrowing short term.  They pay like 10-20% for a few weeks-months because they need the money immediately to survive.  If you compare like your request, realistically a 0% APR $2,000 10 year loan from 60 different people for education to a 122% APR $2000 ($2,400 repayment) 2 month loan to survive, it‚Äôs a joke.  The APR‚Äôs are through the roof showing how risky these are.  


If I took the $120,000 you‚Äôre asking for with $30,000/year for 4 years, just dropped it into VOO or anything and made 8%/year and ran it for 5 years, it‚Äôd be around $155k.  For 10 years, 230k.  You‚Äôre essentially begging for $110,000.  Have some shame please.  Acknowledge it as begging.
Oh these are options. You may need to look up what those are. Way more complex than shares

Wondering how bad the iv crush is going to be? Have calls for 3/31/21 with 33% IV doesn‚Äôt seem that bad
So here's what I've been seeing in SPY:

Bullish divergence since Nov. 28th so this run up is not a shock, I'm just SUPER pissed I didn't pick up some calls.

Futures flagging right now, looking like we'll hit around $336 to complete the bull flag pattern...

At the end of the day, who the fuck knows though, I honestly didn't expect an overnight pump of 1+%

Ok....I have a lot if shares of shit. If sell options and the stocks go in the money. Will i only lose money equivalent to the shares cost minus strike price? So money i technically don't have now anyway. Or is there a way I could lose more than my current investment in said stock.

When it was going up it was always "ZM is up because of COVID". When it was down last week it was "ZM is tracking down with the rest of the technology stocks". Yesterday it was basically "something something volatility". Nobody knows except someone is finally cashing out.
Yea, if we open up I think people look to take profit and what not rather than hold through

Which one are you looking at? I have an F33A Bonanza and it‚Äôs awesome.
"In attempting to understand VIX, it is important to emphasize that it is forward-looking, measuring volatility that the investors expect to see.  It is not backward-looking, measuring volatility that has been recently realized.  Conceptually, VIX is like a bond's yield to maturity.  Yield to maturity is the discount rate that equates a bond's price to the present value of its promised payments.  As such, a bond's yield is implied by its current price and represents the expected future returns of the bond over its remaining life.  In the same manner, VIX is implied by the current prices of S&P 500 index options and represents expected future market volatility over the next 30 calendar days."

Source - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings.

"The VIX estimates the implied volatility of ATM option in SPX with 30 days of duration.  A regular option on the SPX estimates the volatility of SPX itself between today and the day the option expires.  Say it's May.  You're looking at November options in SPX, and they trade at a 25 volatility.  That is the volatility the market anticipates between now and November expiration.  A November VIX future?  Quite different.  That's an estimate of where the VIX will close on November expiration day.  So if in May, you buy or sell a VIX November future or option, you are simply betting on where the VIX will settle on the morning of November expiration.  It's a bet on a single snapshot number that one day.  And since the VIX itself is an estimate of volatility 30 days forward, a May transaction in a November VIX contract bets on where the market six month's hence will estimate volatility 30 days forward from there.  Confused?  You are not alone."

Source - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings.

To tie it all together, VXX is -

"The VXX is an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) that tracks the VIX short-term futures. To be more specific, the VXX is a portfolio composed of the front two month /VX futures that bear continuously changing weights. VXX is just one of the available volatility products, and it is important to note that it does not always perform like the other products may (such as the VIX)." [Source](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/vxx)



TLDR: Instead play volatility directly.  

If bullish, long straddles or strangles in SPY/IWM/QQQ.  If you are worried IV may decline anyways, then short VIX calls.  

If bearish, short straddles or strangles on SPY/IWM/QQQ.  If you are worried IV may go up anyways then play long VIX calls or short VIX puts.  If you plan on collecting theta, it would make more sense to do short puts than long calls and not offset the daily theta decay.
It's so stupid üòÇ

Hey. Be nice.
Both legs at a time?
if you bought it today it wouldn't be the worst thing, I started off in stocks too, penny stocks and this was one of them. Lots of times people would say "long term hold, blah blah blah and I would l say yeah right it's a penny stock, I watched this go from $2 to $8 to $12 and then to over $30, it's got growth and more people took notice, one thing I'll say is the penny stock sub loves doing their DD, some are trash/fake/dumb but some are hardcore about it. Point is, you can $10,000 in stocks and leaps with the other $10,000, godspeed
at this point weekly puts before earnings of any company is free money

I might go back to mostly/all shares. I have a few BABA calls, and they cost so much and take away from margin-using ability. And now this shit, and right before earnings which I hear can eff up  your calls bad. What a headache this option shit is

Ya I trade spreads and thankfully robinhood recognizes this. What retarded robinhood doesn't recognize is that if the options expire you can cover the max loss, so they automatically try to close your spread on expiration day. You can lose a few dollars here which isn't much but adds up over time

Thanks Tanner very cool.

If we open green tomorrow we're never having another red day for like 2 months straight
Dude has been awake for 3 days straight and is surviving purely on McDoubles and Sudafed.
Only thing I hate more than an undecided voter is an undecided stock market.
I have $PLTR $11 calls
Lol what.... you are literally a blabbering moron aren't you?

HANDFUL OF SPORTS
Oh damn Daddy ü§§ what time you picking me up?
Thanks for soiling my YouTube history
I said puts...
Yup. Depending on how close of a call it is... if it‚Äôs a landslide then we‚Äôll most likely know by tonight honestly
What‚Äôs he doing? Desperately making copes about voter fraud and shit?
Dude always rambles like a mad man.  This your first Trump interview or is it especially bad today?  LOL
So just like any other interview?
Buy the clit at open?!
That‚Äôs only short term. Leaps are super cheap
Ban all r/politics idiots please mods.
It‚Äôs probably because of daylight savings
Been saying it all weekend. Absolutely the play.
‚ÄúHow I Met Your Mother‚Äù if you ever watched that.

Ah I got it what you were trying to say.Thanks
Wait to catch the knife, shit plunges easyüî™üñê
got greedy and held their puts too long and are now broke, again, haha!
Ever looked up symptoms you‚Äôre having on the internet... only to find out you have stage 69 penis cancer?
We got notifications from the auto mod for a long ass time if you said his name. so we are trained to say mango instead

I‚Äôve always understood early voting to be by mail and absentee ballots 

I‚Äôve never seen voting locations open before election Tuesday
Yeah. I been holding SQQQ calls 11/20 and 12/18. Banking on prints
Mango is over, invest in dementia pills instead

Stop chasing, start thinking
I see thank for info.
Please do! I sold covered calls thinking my shares would just sit quietly for a while! I need out

Then we can rally galore
prepare to get IV crushed bruh
Gotcha so calendar spreads might be effective in reducing my risk atleast for the short term
IV's were close to ATH's yesterday. Normally, I think theta gang is a bunch of pussies who are basically the r/investing of options. 

But, the election play is selling OTM's here on the huge potential vol collapse.
College Dropout and Late Registration were both amazing albums. His original music was not meh at best. He also didn't always publicly have the ego now has.
Anyone watching this trump interview live??

He‚Äôs rambling like a mad man what the fuck

BABA is the sound a baby makes, obviously not a sound investment.
Sounds like liberal propaganda to me. In my town of 14 people the polling place is right next door to the Wendy‚Äôs we all work at and lines don‚Äôt exist... so it must be like that everywhere.

I have a 1440 sat so if that helps in answering transfer question?
This is the way
Not looking to get blown out if there is a big move. All my options are paid for courtesy of covered calls.
So with $300,000 - I can make $80,000 roughly a year? Please explain how? What is the stately called? I‚Äôll google it. What stocks to use. I‚Äôm in this! We can pm please. I like this better than options, I‚Äôm switching over. And what brokers should I use? Robinhood? and how does making the $20,000 every 3 months work? And what happens if I‚Äôm assigned shares? If you have time to answer all this, thanks a lot! If not, no worries. I‚Äôm a noobie, learning while waiting for the market to open lol
Bro this is WSB. We're here to talk shit as much as to discuss the stock market

Early voting has been a thing for ages. Early voting accounted for 42% of all votes in 2016. People still vote on election day, and exit polls still happen.
Prob not the main competitor but a competitor nonetheless. I‚Äôve been following them for a while, have some shares, like the company and think they will do well.
Basically saying "just let the market do what it's supposed to do", "let the new economy form" and for the govt. to stop propping up zombie companies and get out of the way.
Lol which one of you tards went and placed the .01 bid?
To be fair, WFC, XOM and CCL are all shitty companies with businesses perfectly designed to fail in the 2020 crisis. All three of them a glowing radioactive heaps of üí©, not even worth shorting now.

Aphria to 6 üîú
Wait it out a couple of days. I've consistenly made the mistake of jumping right back in after a dip. It will dip for a bit. Also, who knows what tonight will bring. If Biden wins by a margin will Trump concede? Too much risk don't you think? Wait until tomorrow or Thursday.
Most painful comment I've read in the last 5 mins, and that's saying something
Where's all the bears?
Also, if this is real and you actually waited until the day of to prepare, it doesn‚Äôt really matter what stock you pick. You‚Äôre fucked
Tech can be taking over the world and be overvalued at the same time
It then ended green
Lmfaooooo another mentally unstable Trumptard. Typical.
Any tickers for companies growing mangoes?
IPOB went from $10 to $25 which was actually a 150% return if you sold. Even no name stuff like FMCI netted a 100% return which is now Tattooed Chef (TTCF).
Glad I leave work early. Rednecks gonna lose it after Biden stomps Trump.
Ant news no bueno

It has nothing to do with age ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù. Take one look at Biden and tell me he doesn‚Äôt look like he could croak at any moment.
Mango?
Depends on if its close or not. 2016 was very close so if its like that not till next week or so more than likely, but this time we are breaking all voter turnout records which imo implies a large win for one or the other. Idk which, but my guess with all the fake news is biden

Enough that you have so much money that you can spend money to fuck over someone else. For most of us that means our boss, in the traditional "Fuck you, I quit". For these I would say you would need to be financially secure enough to not need a job again, so be in the upper income status based on investments alone. For a single person (or single earner household) then you're looking at needing $200k a year with no draw down. You could take the ultra conservative route, being tied to the 5 year CD/Savings rate or 1%, this would mean you would need 20M. More appropriately it would be generating 200k in dividends with a "safe" portfolio (25% BND/VOO/VXUS/VNQ or 2.6% yield) or \~7.7M. 

If you're replacing both incomes, then double the numbers.

If you're going to work at Lowe's or something, then halve the numbers. 

If you want Lambo's, then triple the numbers.

Well IV crush just means you shouldn't buy too far out and you'll make less profit even if it shifts your direction. Spreads can reduce that impact but ultimately high IV just means you're taking on a higher risk.

Aka if you think a big move is gonna be made in your direction, go for it. But if you're wrong about the direction or the momentum, you'll get fucked.
And then gets his salad tossed by the obvious money print goes brrr into a big bubble for corporate America.

Bro what? Are you delusional? Mango is fat as fuck and would go into cardiac arrest. Joe would just randomly fall over and die. Neither one of these dudes are balling
That‚Äôs what they said in 2014
The dip was last week. Now it‚Äôs trying to break the 35$ level. I mean nothing is a straight line in investing but Nio has to have a bad day to go back under 30. Just don‚Äôt see that happening

International students get scholarships. By the way - go study in Europe, Germany pays ALL tuition even for foreigners.
If you want to take economics, you failed the intro. You're trying to take out a loan at a time of huge demand, finite supply and further fucked up by the government having its bottomless checkbook involved through Stafford loans. At a top university where you will be paying top premium for little relative benefit. This is on top of having an undergrad no longer cuts it if you want to get into anything quantitative or related. Most jobs are looking for master's minimum. Tack on more debt. You are paying into a huge student loan bubble as it is. You are in at the top. That's not the place you want to make your entry.

If you haven't qualified for scholarships on top of just getting into the school, you will likely not be competitive enough to standout from everyone else around you. Going to a cheaper, less acclaimed school but being a stud compared to your peers will be more beneficial than being near the bottom or even average at Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc. Talk shit about community college, but they are getting fundamentally similar education at a fraction of the cost. If you're dead set on a university, excelling at a state school will be better than struggling at an Ivy.

1. They fucked with uncle sam by being too close with GYNA and Russia and uncle sam fucks back.

2. Their earnings may have peaked with covid and they are over valued for a one off scenario where their earnings were sky high. If they cant beat covid earnings, they are over valued.

3. China declared war on American tech just last week and is actively targeting APPLE in the 5 year plan. Its open season on American innovation and the gloves are off.

Unfortunately i had the opportunity to talk directly with the likely MT governor (Gianforte) that dickhead said he doesn't support Marijuana legalization but in the same step talked about how he wanted value added agriculture in MT.

Give me a break dude nobody knows where this market is gonna go. None of it makes sense. You can't be surprised if the market went down even more just like you can't really be surprised that it's green right now. People also thought it was stupid to buy outs after Monday drilled yet we drilled again later in the week. Nothing fucking matters it's all a coin toss.

Ill just hold these BABA calls till it blows over.  Probably sell them for less of a loss next week. But fuck my ass and fuck china
How often does IV on a stock go up after earnings? Tonight is like earnings, except for the whole country. VIX is not "exploding" considering it already ran up to 41 in the last week. 

Also, notice how VIX is making lower highs even as the market went lower Friday? Volatility is done and people are going to be holding the bag as always.

And VIX is calculated by looking at put prices on SPX. Powell and Mnuchin are not out there selling puts, that's about the stupidest thing I've heard on this sub, and that includes people that bought Kodak at 50.
When will they announce if trump or Biden wins? Any1
People complaining about $BABA...
Did you get your calls at $300? I swear WSB is always too late. People have been singing BABA since last ER when it dropped to 254. That's when I got my Jan calls. Even with this price action, still up bigly
I‚Äôm gonna take my glock with me in my hoodie since it‚Äôs 30 degrees but I‚Äôm not really in the mood to be picked with since it‚Äôs cold and kinda wet.

Vix doesn't listen to nobody, it marches to the beat of its own drum.  It is simply a statistic that estimates volatility 30 days forward. [More info](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6e2fu/vixvxx/gb039wt/)

So Harris?
They don't need to buy stocks, flooding the system with money and destroying yields on bonds is more than enough to jack up prices. With how high inflation is right now (housing costs up double digits YoY last few years), people need yield and "safe investments" have literally 0 yield. Buy stocks or struggle to survive basically.
Shouldn't have waited this long. But good luck nonetheless. And thank you for voting. This would have been my second general election but I sat out of the 16 election. Thanks for not being an idiot like me

Just grow a pair most people whenever they ask i tell them to pick whatever they like and that i cant do their research for them
I don‚Äôt wanna talk about it. I‚Äôm holding OSTK, TWTR, FLWS, and NOK 11/20 calls. Currently down about 40-90% across the board. I decided not to make anymore YOLO elections time calls. I‚Äôm just going to buy shrimp ramen this week and pretend it‚Äôs lobster on my boat.
This is the way
Apply to U of Maine, Vermont, Arizona, UMass, UConn - they will offer huge merit scholarships or go to McGill in Canada - much easier immigration after graduation. Bentley is also possible. Big names matter less especially if you want to be an entrepreneur. Don‚Äôt pay $300,000 for a marketing or finance degree - you will feel scammed at the end.

‚ÄúRetarded‚Äù is so 2014 bro
Get Federal loans through FAFSA like everyone else. Total student debt is $1.7 trillion. Don‚Äôt worry, just never repay your loans after graduation or live in another country permanently. 

Use your brain. Begging for loans is embarrassing. I hope this is a joke because this post screams entitlement.

It‚Äôs China. The government controls most of private business. If Ma didn‚Äôt preclear his plans with the CCP, this was inevitable. They probably are concerned about the level of foreign investment this will attract.

rip BABA calls
"Do you have a post election safety plan in place? Regardless of who wins election there could be anger and violence. We need to be prepared physically and mentally. Do all your grocery shopping before election night. Use paid time off from work if you have it. Lock your doors and windows and don't answer the door for strangers. Have a battery powered radio in case the power goes out. Pack a "go bag" with food, clothing, meds, cash, and weapons. Make sure your car has a full tank of gas in case you need to evacuate your community entirely on short notice."

I've seen shit like this on my Facebook wall like 5 times in the past couple days. Reminds me of how scared people were of Y2K and it turned out to be nothing.

The market clearly is not scared though so fuck my puts I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüåàüêªüçÜüò≠

Why's baba dumping?
Historically sp500 returns 11% when a democrat is in office vs 7% when a republican is president so I‚Äôm hoping for a Biden win especially since we‚Äôll get a bigger stimulus but if trump loses who knows what the reaction will be
Hey, this guy is a great big PHONY!

Okay so we now know how to dump BABA: Summon 3 autists.

I think I know how to pump stocks, I use a photo copier to print hundies now that JPOW stopped. If we all do this stocks should moon.

If you go to the ER they will. (always have for me). Depends on where you live, in my city the docs don't do it at all, because of so many junkies in town. But i've had it work out fine in other states, just make sure you don't smell like booze at all when you go.

What's the play today? How do we make green? where are my tendies?

give it to me
I think it‚Äôs stupidly high already and it‚Äôs a bad idea, but if you‚Äôre dead set on it, sell ATM puts and buy ATM calls.
The new report sounds more damning
Go to predictit.org. That is what is priced into markets. The market prices things in as they see them 6-12 months in advance. Once you see it on the news, it‚Äôs far too late to make money. Trump used to be the favorite, then the underdog. That‚Äôs why Dem stuff has done well in 2020.
Just a follow up, AMC with a big miss on earnings and currently up in pre market @2.30. The risk to reward on these trades typically are not worth shorting. Just my opinion, which means nothing.
Trumps an anti-hero, he has to be against the establishment, even if it's the Republican establishment otherwise he can't get the backlash vote.
A year under mango, under biden idk

Good I‚Äôm tired of hearing about the ant ipo, I swear they were hyping it in July
One of you guys had a good point lol. Why the fuck is tech dying and why did JPM downgrade tech? Bruh Nasdaq is like 10% off from record high, all earnings beat and the virus is worse than ever. 

Than the even funnier thing is why tf did cruise line go green after announcing the no sail extension. Bruh I swear, any logic in this market and you lose money.

Anyway, current positions. I‚Äôm fucked.

Yeah stable foreign relationship as in being china‚Äôs bitch for the next 4 years
assuming he started working at 16, making \~10/hr 40hrs a week, that's 20k.

he can't do 40hrs a week, so lop that off to 20hrs... so roughly 10k a year. Now do that for 5 years, so 50k over 5 years, without factoring in expenses. He only has 16k.

Nice what did you invest your $6 into?
The RSI divergence on oil majors on the weekly is massive. Literally there‚Äôs a possibility of doubling stock price over the next 6 months.
Because oil stocks cant go much lower. Some are at 30 year lows, plenty of drillers are BK, when demand goes up supply may have a hard time catching up, price of oil will take off.  Why do you expect XLE to just go to $10/share?  Oil majors still make $100s billions in revenue per year.
Overpaying for an undergraduate degree is common for international students but you really should consider why you need to spend $300,000 for an education that can be had for 50% less at picnic universities. 

Are you aware it will be impossible to het a job in the US after you graduate? No employee will sponsor you as the supply of US students seeking a similar job is plentiful. It costs corporations lots of money to pay legal fees. It‚Äôs common for senior executives as their skill set is exceptional. If you want to stay after you graduate you will need to spend another $100,000-300,000 on a graduate degree on a STEM field to qualify for 2 year OPT work visa. The job won‚Äôt pay well and Once again employers will be cautious unless you are a computer science wizard. 

Sorry for your situation - call the financial aid office and start negotiating. They might offer you something but you will pretty much need to beg as they need full pay kids to give to the poor kids that truly need it.

Test it out. Pick out 4 randos and send them dick pics, bank account photoshopped pics. Experimenting is how you know
Markets don't react to fundamental stuff but to emotions. Wall street bros want Biden to win just because, and they concoct a whole bunch of weird explanations why that's good.

The truth is that it really doesn't matter who wins. WSB sells itself short, all investors are retards deep down.
You just said in your topic post that you were 17.  Now you say you're 18.  Are you 17 or 18?  I would assume that would be hard for a uni student to forget.

Lol businesses boarding up isn‚Äôt some major predictor. Polls are close bud. Nobody really knows but Biden has an edge in the poles.
I sold after new home sales went down last month. I love the fundamentals on the stock but it just seems like every piece of good news is oversold. I'm hopeful Q3 earnings gives it some consistency

Republic of Congo stock market predicting someone will win the elections today
holy shit why?
Biden is bullish for Oil cause he will restrict oil so oil production will decrease and drive small oil companies under which increases prices, which consolidates it into the hands of the large companies like XOM

I guess we're back to stocks only going up? Just in time I went near last week. Market can't be having me make money for too long eh?
I don‚Äôt really care who wins, but ü•≠ losing would be the most hilarious outcome üòÇ

It does actually. 50 states elect the president, not 330M people. Theoretically a president could win with just 23% of the popular vote because of this.

Geez.. only making <$62k a year, but throws this much into a single stock?? Truly do **belong** here
Thinking about buying 5 AMC $5C 1/2023 as a YOLO if they survive this pandemic and don't shutter completely. This is all off a gut feeling that whoever put their money into this a few years ago is going to do everything to keep it from dying
Never even heard of the symbol. I'll pick up 5 contracts of CGC 11/20 15p at open.
XPEV & LI are this Summer's EV IPOs as well. XPEV is younger in the business life cycle than NIO, if you want a shot at getting in at an EV before it blows up. XPEV & LI are still very volatile due to day trading and can be picked up as bargains on low swings for long positions. But those two are also gaining ground fast and there will be diminishing opportunities to get them at bargain prices going forward.

China has declared some crazy goal to be renewable by 2060. I forget the details, but it's very credible since China's very dependent on importing energy and that's expensive AF for a manufacturing society. If the US renewable/EV stocks have topped out, I'd say there's at least a decade of magnificent renewable/EV gains there. So in terms of big picture, you're getting in very early in that decades-long arc if you start initiating positions in 2020.
Everyone having fun, including small cap, meanwhile tech...
Kanye wins stocks ATH
The fact that tech has been the laggard makes me think the market is pricing in a blue wave and a fat stimmy, which small caps and the broader market will benefit most from. 

A Trump victory is better for mega cap tech that benefits from small businesses going bankrupt and people staying home as the virus spreads.

Regardless of the outcome, I honestly think the bottom of this sell off is close or has already passed, but only if the election isnt contested and the Fed doesnt scare the fuck out of everyone this week.

Fair enough.  Despite BABA‚Äôs fundamentals though, the stock hasn‚Äôt moved much during past two earnings.

yeah fuck this
My thoughts about why the market is bullish: its excited to move beyond election drama
Purge priced in
Rs actively trying to steal this election they worried about that blue tsunami. Don‚Äôt worry brainwashed cattle even if your taxes go up the market will go up more.
This is the way
Whole system is fake. I watch MSNBC in the mail in ballot processing center, where they open the secure ballot envelops. The people literally look at the enveolpe to see if the number matches for like 2 seconds. I doubt they even look when the camera off, and even if they do how hard would it be to counterfeit an envelope if they just glance at it for a second and toss it into a pile.
There's nothing to excuse. We joke about asking for money in memes at times but this is actual begging, self promotion.

how illegal is it to sell your vote

edit: 5 years jailtime
Over long time frames yeah. Right now there's idiotic panic about the dollar but that's actually what the fed wants.

But if you have to avoid a -50% drop you go cash gang, you don't give a fuck about long term. Bonds are ded courtesy of jpow.
Ok, but i was referring to any election disturbance, it was at 31 this morning, i dont think its out of the realm of possibility. Im feeling you may be right though and i might just buy @ low 30's.

What's the market cap?
So according to the logic I‚Äôm seeing, either candidate that wins is bullish? And the only way we tank is if we don‚Äôt know? Yeah I‚Äôm out of these puts EOD. Not dealing with that iv crush coming tomorrow. The fuck did we tank for last week( besides me having calls) ? Smh, nothing has changed this week.
yes, you have to have the money in your account. robinhood will automatically exercise when the time comes
Nobody is forcing you to vote, but wars are fought for less and you should exercise that right
In 2016 wasnt Trump negative the day of the election?
He should be clear by now as COVID runs its course in 2 weeks if it doesnt cause complications. So no
Then you are an indecisive fence sitter with no strong convictions
Then don‚Äôt vote bud. Free country..for now

If Trump dies of a heart attack/stroke over the shock of his loss to Biden, does his death certificate show the cause of death as COVID?
Vanguard, Blackrock?
I dont know if yall have read the latest news...NIO is paying another Chinese car manufacturer to make their cars. NIO is currently limited to oy selling in China. As we all know, the Chinese market has been growing and will continue to do so. However, only being allowed to sell to one country means that the stock price will hit a ceiling. So if you want to get into NIO, its best to do it sooner rather than later. Tesla on the other hand....can sell to multiple countries...
Gotta give the loan defaults and bankruptcies time to overwhelm the fed. 

Look at any previous real crash, big drops are followed by (less) big rallies.   Takes awhile for the euphoria to wear off.  People going to keep thinking they can make up the losses all the way to the bottom.

True, but this is not a growth play.  AMC began the year at $7.26 and hit $7.61 in August.  Since AMC warned investors that it *might* file for bankruptcy, investors fled.  When everyone is looking one way, the other side is what interests me.  The risk is bankruptcy, but the reward for simply returning to their shitty existence is sizeable.  Here are some [unrelated graphs](https://youtu.be/U1zrV-vFGWA?t=360), not sure the source.
Now that we‚Äôre on to them, do they tank it?

The pandemic has reduced the demand for petroleum and accelerated the transition towards renewables, hence the sharp jump this year. A Biden victory is probable, so it's been partially priced in. If he does win, renewables should jump up even more. I'll look at more diversified, US-focused renewable ETFs like QCLN

I'd say put 15K into NIO: buy 10K worth of NIO now. See how the week goes, maybe even buy another 5k within this week - or keep the remaining 5k for averaging down if it dips next week or the following week.

Put the remaining 5k in SBE (Chargepoint).

Hey Americans, shouldn't you be out voting? LOOL
Anything under 30? Or do you think it could hit 25 at a low.
You‚Äôre using the last year as logic for that statement. You have to remember this market is unlike any seen before and the valuations (especially in tech) are highly propped up. Stimulus is a short term gain for some people. If Biden wins, he‚Äôll be looking at the UK and other countries who are locking down for guidance on Covid. I‚Äôm betting (with my plays), that this week doesn‚Äôt matter as much as next or the following if there is a sweep. People will pull out of sectors and there will be a lot of unsettled investors. Tech will be hurt, break ups will be on the horizon, taxes will be levied, and healthcare will change. Hold on to your butts.
Just take student loan like rest of the Americans mate. This aint charity in here.

My girlfriend has chosen a nickname, out of nowhere, for my penis. She has chosen, for some god forsaken reason, to call it 'princess little piddles'. I have no idea where she got this name but it's not the most manly nickname, and honestly, I don't even have a nickname for it so why should she?? Every time she calls it by her nickname, I feel ashamed!

Am I the asshole for making her stop calling it that? Or should I just let her keep it up? I'm afraid this waking nightmare may never end.

UPDATE: I spoke with my girlfriend regarding this nickname fiasco. She informed me that it was not the princess that was little, it was the piddles that were little. That didn't make me feel much better tho.

I offered another nickname, per another user, "princess big and long piddles" but she said that was a mouthful. We compromised on allowing me to pick a nickname for her penis. Thanks everyone.

Thanks for sharing.  AMC is in a particularly bad spot compared to other cinemas because they also financed some upgrades and acquisitions pre-pandemic.  Also, fully agree with your closing comments.

"AMC is in tight corner, as it acknowledged. It has about $5 billion in debt and high debt means high interest expense. AMC, which is majority owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda, racked it up pre-pandemic with a string of acquisitions, dividend payments and upgrades to its theaters." - [Source](https://deadline.com/2020/10/cinema-stocks-teeter-wall-street-ponders-possible-amc-entertainment-bankruptcy-1234596738/)
most stocks that pay over 2% do so because their stock went down, not because they paid a huge dividend to begin with

Nasdaddy lagging like a bitch
Taking this from you most recent article comparing yearly return. One of these being during a pandemic, I'd say the market doesn't care much which party is in the white house
Barack Obama (D): 12.4%

Donald Trump (R): 11.8%
I lost some money before the election, really temped to yolo into more calls but I probably should wait for the election to be over.
Massive red candles premarket?
Yeah. Bought a house in 2018. Haven't deposited money into my brokerage account in over a decade but have pulled cash out every year.
It‚Äôs harder when you‚Äôve already been on top
You should probably head over to r/investing with those conservative ass positions. No one in this sub holds 100% shares in their portfolio. If you bought calls, you would literally have a million dollars already. 

Mods - Ban this man for being a total vagina
I've seen it all in this irrational market, fat red drop beginning of day and then green end of day. Then bears and bulls arguing about if volatility is priced in.

Biden bullish for oil, since he will shut down oil production, so big players will get larger share while oil prices increase. Smaller producers will go under.
Joe Biden literally caught flak during the primaries because he gave a private speech to Goldman Sachs in which he said ‚ÄúI have your back.‚Äù

Shit is laughable that he‚Äôs going to tank the markets.
well about the election related stuff anyway. The protests against police violence might be impacted even if Biden won.
[deleted]
The market would green dildo on every whisper of stimulus *hopes* and you‚Äôre really confused why it‚Äôs celebrating the likely-victory of the people needed for an enormous stimmy?

Every president had ‚ÄúMiddle East peace deals‚Äù.  This has been going on for decades and doesn‚Äôt lead to anything.  But ok, let‚Äôs give him that one.

The economy has been booming since Obama years, so I don‚Äôt see why that wouldn‚Äôt continue.  In the long run, Trump‚Äôs oil and coal obsession will put us in a worse place. It‚Äôs a dying industry, and it‚Äôs like trying to hold on to horse and buggies while the world moves toward automobiles.  I‚Äôd rather have the Dem‚Äôs push for making us a leader in renewable energy.  We don‚Äôt want to be left behind while the world moves on.

Wtf is his immigration policy?  Talking shit about other countries and putting children in cages?

Not sure what you mean by ‚Äúweird tariffs.‚Äù  Trump is the one that imposes random tariffs on a whim, because some leader said something not nice about him.  And those tariffs are paid for by OUR companies.

Trump barely has any concrete policies.  His only plan for the economy is giving tax breaks to those that don‚Äôt need them and to prop up outdated industries like coal.  And even with coal, where are all those coal plants he promised to bring back?  They are not coming back.  It‚Äôs just bullshit pandering.   On healthcare, where is this ‚Äúbest healthcare for a lot cheaper‚Äù that he‚Äôs promised since before his first term?  Doesn‚Äôt exist.  And his foreign policy is based on which foreign leader said something nice or bad about him.

Don‚Äôt be fooled.  He‚Äôs an empty suit that just says whatever people want to hear.

Why would it be? People have been able to vote for weeks now. It's never taken me more then 30 minutes to vote and many states have rules requiring employers to give you time to vote.
I‚Äôm talking bout voting. Participating in Democracy ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Of course - but just watch what they do, not what they say. For example, Illinois is raising taxes yet again on property owners and everyone else. They will also simply issue more debt to 'kick the can' just a bit longer. At the end of the day, they will tax their populace into financial oblivion, vs. actually default on their debt - they know the moment that happens it's game-over.

seriously.  selling credit spreads on spy fuds should be free money
I'm confused as to how you think trump did wonders for the stock market.  Are you young/ just getting into stocks recently? The returns under Obama were approximately as large as the returns under trump and arguably better under Obama.

it isn't even that! TODAY I found out that in CA you could have started voting in person a few days ago, maybe last week? I dunno. But people have been sproadically voting when convenient. I was stressed because I couldn't figure out when I could go vote today but when I found that out, I voted last night!

what does that mean? NO EXIT POLLING DATA BY MEDIA!! 

no exit polls = no ability to call

there is NO ONE that is going to concede this election and if they do, they are stupid
üåàüêª only hope is that tech drags everything else down with it

I'm currently up YTD 16%.  For 2019, I was down 30%.  Shifting to purely playing options was the main difference between those two years.

dude the share will be sold at open. You will not have any recovery. buy a protective put at your stop loss value. It costs money, but it will not go sideways.
Depends on the scale.
Not only that but there‚Äôs this corona thing that‚Äôs going around. Pretty bad stuff.
He‚Äôs probably holding weeklies. In which case that‚Äôs a big move.
Respect yourself
WSB is to bullish. It‚Äôs a trap!
Depends how bad they are?  I think its unlikely they'll be anything too major though, so to ignore that possibility is probably the right move.
I literally just listened to this. Hahaha

How about you
Guys if you haven't voted yet please vote today. Its your last chance. Every vote counts.
This. And that's why you see company's going down with solid earnings. It's not because things are bad now, it's because there was no good reason for the stock to double in price earlier this year.

At this point my theory is the Biden win was already priced in last week when the correction happened.  We'll still have a red day this week but nothing like a crash.  Market being red during the election was just too obvious of a play.  But they're banking pretty hard on no civil unrest.

So are we selling renewable energy and cannabis calls at open or holding?
Don‚Äôt listen to these retards saying buy now because it‚Äôs going to 40$. If you‚Äôre trying to invest invest then buy 20k worth over the course of 4 months.
Yea unless you are blind. If biden wins he's gonna give stimulus from 2-3 tril. With trump it's probably more limited.. It's simple to see how that would impact the market right? And that's without looking at chinese companies. Just b/c you are stupid doesn't mean we all have to be

 Gay facts. Everybody on this sub has spent their hard earned GBP to get  some seed capital or works at McD's. It takes guts to make sound  investments that literally cannot go tits up, you could've gotten a  Switch game with those points. For your wife's boyfriend it's not a good  thing to do options. So yes, I agree with you about YOLO moves and  especially if you like men who wear women's clothing. One more faüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èot on  this subüçÜüí¶
Yeah the mods are obviously conservatives and extremely biased. But I think they eased up for election week on the bans ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ok man. Keep buying those putz lmao. Go for broke!!
Haha sounds good to me
**My reasonings for investing in NIO:**

1. EV is becoming popular everywhere and China is pushing hard for it. For example, the state of Hefei recently loaned $1 billion into NIO.  
2. China is at the forefront of tackling climate change; President Xi Jinping says he aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.
3. They have the biggest market for EV and its middle class is growing rapidly (I believe it's predicted to be 550 million in three years, more than one-and-a-half times the entire U.S. population today).
4. Demand is growing for their cars - they are setting new records in sales every month so far.
5. It's still in its growth stage so there's lots of room for its share price to grow. They are already doing relatively well domestically and have still yet to expand to the rest of the world. 
6. I like how NIO focuses on the customer experience, much like what Amazon did with their brand. This is evident by its high referral rate through word of mouth.
7. I think it's criminally undervalued at the moment because it's a Chinese company. Investors are afraid to put their money in because they are scared of fraud, which is totally understandable, as it has happened in the past with other companies like Luckin Coffee, but I am optimistic this opinion could change in the future.
8. China as a whole is pretty much back to normal post-covid, at least compared to everywhere else. I think this stability will entice more investors to invest into China in the foreseeable future.
9. I like the look of their cars and can see myself buying one if they come to my city.
10. I have a good feeling about the CEO. He's an interesting character with lots of strong connections. He has grit and seems to not be in it for the money, but for the future of China.
Calls on Caesar ?
Trump was the best gift China and Russia ever got. Twitter rambling doesn‚Äôt hurt China.

I... Didn't say that.
They use to be absolutely ridiculous about political bans. I think they learned to ease up since you can‚Äôt filter everything like that during election time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they might as well let it run it‚Äôs course and then go back to normal in a week or two hopefully when things settle

hi guys. i think i may be autistic
Yup true. Not terribly worried I knew the risk of playing the election volatility. It expires 13 NOV so might have time to correct itself or run up more. Either way I'll profit and the good news is the puts I sold are dead in the water.
There should be a age limit on candidates. Like 60 or something.

Here‚Äôs my point and it will easily be proven but there are so many Brexit from the Democrat party whether it‚Äôs gay and lesbian blacks Latinos that you have none of that on the Republican side. Some of those Democrat votes are going to be voting Republican.  A third of the attendees at the rallies are Republicans!  His percentage is going to be too high to not call.

To add insult to injury the VIX will die so those inflated SPY put premiums from yesterday won‚Äôt recover even if there‚Äôs a dip.

why?
Agree fuck off with the politics
You should actually buy before the election because the market usually goes down a week to days before the election and then bounces back to higher values after the election date. Altough this is only true for the last two elections with Obama and Trump and sometimes it has gone down like with GW so it's still a gamble and with this year it wouldn't suprise me one bit.

I‚Äôve bought things in person (instruments off craigslist) and paid the dude with the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù option on PayPal so they don‚Äôt have their income tapped by PayPal in the exchange.

Needless to say - PayPal isn‚Äôt going anywhere because of their online checkout for small business owners.

I'm in a slightly similar position to you and am just curious of your risk tolerance and circumstance
No but US won‚Äôt leave NATO under Biden. So defense picks might not be too bad

Cant even figure out who's who in ur description, except that kanye isnt the second one.
People that advised 21-25 year olds to "go to college" really saved their little white collar asses. Lots of blue collar service jobs are screwed but you're right, most office jobs can be done from home on Zoom calls. It's the restauranteurs that I feel bad about, hopefully they're getting rent forbearance or some sort of relief since Pelosi hijacked stimulus to help sleepy Joe get elected
Easy win, its in the bag already don‚Äôt even need to bother standing in the queue for hours to vote.
I'm going to say this with all sincerity.

If Trump loses, sell.

The cash you're able to keep will allow you to take advantage of the dip.

I know I'm like billionth person to tell you this, but the economy isn't what it seems.

If you really looked at the numbers and understood the game that was being played you'd cash out.

Once Biden comes in, this fairytale land of stonks only go up will crash down as forclosures and bankruptcies shoot up. Additionally, if a vaccine is found, it'll be a sell the news situation. That will signal to companies that it is time to come out of hibernation, declare bankruptcy, and recapitalize.

But congrats on your gamble win. And remember it's when you sell that counts...not your paper gains.
Hi! What's the point of having a stupid Paypal account? Had one, never needed it. Don't think I need it.

As bears would say... sell your positions its going to drop... works vice versa to it doesn‚Äôt stay down and out forever
They don't even have proper ssl setup.
This is sooo accurate
This one time,  stocks went up before they went down.
Russians have a vaccine already as they did not drop the research when western medical companies did when SARS fizzled out and they could not make money in it anymore.

but considering that this is a virus which mutates as much as flu, i doubt the new vaccines would be anything than a band aid on a full blown wound. even flu vaccines just protect against 3 of most common strains out of over 300 outthere. corona at this point already has probably over dozen strains

and the Moderna selfmutating vaccine sounds like a beginning of every zombie movie

and the biggest issue, well good luck getting people vaccinated. people are against vaccinating kids with 40+year established child vaccines and you think they will just line up for something that was conjured up within a year, so they can fly with airplanes or go to bahamas? suddenly the life in suburbia in SFH with trips to woods sounds very appealing

There are multiple outcomes that are close and potentially contested:
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/

Although Biden currently has a 90% of winning according to the forecasts, 97% probability to win the popular vote.

Trump is already trying to discredit mail in votes and wants votes that are counted after election day to be disregarded. Something the forecasts wont be able to model. But mail in voters are leaning democratic.

I fear that he will try to steal the presidency this way. Market wont like this for sure.

Welcome to¬†Pre-market pajama trading, where everything is made up and the points don‚Äôt matter.¬†That's right! Futures are just like your birthday, since your dad left to pick up milk and cigarettes
So let me get this straight. 

You decided that since your job isn't secure, why not just buy the stock too?

I understand the film business better than you, so I know your biggest issues. One of which is that theaters usually do a lot better when it rains. However, during Coronavirus, who the eff wants to go to the theater if they'll get the COVID? So that winter attendence uptick is just fantasyland.

Beyond that all of the Studios have pushed back their tent poles so good luck selling much more than a dozen hot dogs during your prime set. Oh yeah, didn't you hear? All of those mid tier films are going directly to Disney Plus and Netflix too. So all of that ticket margin that you would have received from sucky films like Artemis Fowl, Hamilton, and Mulan from lower film rental costs are gone as well. They are Disney +'s problem now. 

AMC is just waiting until Studios start to produce films again for directly for the theaters. When they do, it'll take months before they get them filmed and through post. Then they'll probably try to cut corners on marketing spend...so it will be even slower than that. The perfect time to declare bankruptcy is right before a new slate of films hits the movie theaters, but they won't have the cash flow to last that long. 

By the way, did you see what Warner and Disney just did? Yeah, they said that the people who run their streaming services are now in charge of their theatrical production slates as well. Kilar got hired at that dumpster fire AT&T Warner Blows and a bunch of digital suits are now in charge at Disney. So when a decision to greenlight the next film comes around for theaters, the digital guys probably won't care as much.

You'll know you are 100% toast when the Marvel films start going directly to Disney +. We're not there yet, but it's getting closer and closer...and you can only hold Black Widow for so long before the executives rationalize that the Disney + Sub revenue is worth it. (Not a smart decision, but I've seen dumber...and if things don't open up again next summer, Disney isn't want to hold the P&A costs on their balance sheet all the way through 2022.) 

Do yourself a favor and learn how to code. Or something you can do that doesn't involve cleaning empty theaters or asking a couple of they would like to upsize their order.

It's going to be a tough couple of years. The theaters are gonna burn through captial like there's no tomorrow because landlords are beholden to their debt holders and building rents are a big part of the operating cost structure.

AMC will come back eventually. Just don't bank your financial future on it being before they declare bankruptcy or recapitalize a half dozen times.
My friend‚Äôs a virologist and actually told me this virus is extremely unlikely to mutate.

Mutations come from errors in replicated genetic code, and this virus is extremely good at making its genetic code consistent - which is actually a stroke of luck for us.

I would only sell once I need the money or it‚Äôs an amount that would set me up for life.

VXX calls incase the election is crazy and/or orange man angry

SLV long dated calls because no matter what happens we are getting stimulus sometime in the next few months
It might bounce...  at least it would in a normal week.  That‚Äôs a lot of growth for one week.

But for an election week, anything goes.  If Biden starts getting a big enough lead (even with trump contesting), I think Plug is going to start pushing up even more.
That day with the big drop overnight was a trick to get people to buy puts. Expect steep drop again this afternoon going into tomorrow after everyone gives up on their puts and gets into calls.

You jelly your candidate isn't a LYRICAL GENIUS
market doesn't care who wins. market is predicting no uncertainty

Which one do u even mean? The one who lost his trade war?
As you deserve it for buying puts and holding them over night
Yeah thats why you americans crack us up every time

A historic morning for autists across the spectrum.  Those asking when the election is called are on the lower end.  Higher end autists base equity plays on future indexes.  Rest f us have bad backs, holding LEAP puts, and follow JPOW‚Äôs Tik Tok account.

I doubt it and there might be Defense budget cutbacks under Biden.

Gaping traders asses!!!that is all good bye.
You must be so cultured amd know so many things about government. Where did you learn these hot takes? Fox news? The view?
Are you betting any money today? I am so tempted to buy puts.
Straight facts. Most the people in the sub have the money coming from their rich parents or old scumbags . It‚Äôs easy to gamble money that isn‚Äôt yours, you didn‚Äôt work for that they just give it to you. For someone that works his ass off in order to invest is not a good thing to do options. So yes I agree with you about buying stocks if your young and especially if you worked hard for that money.One less autist on the subü§ô

Iv been buying donkey kang Jan options since it dropped to sub 50. Some of em lost at least 70% value. Decided to short some delta by selling calls. Definitely helped a lot with cutting the losses. Also rolled them to mar and may. Im now holding 20x 45c Mar and 10x 50c May calls. Best of luck buddy

Edit: i rolled them midweek last week. IV is crushing my ass. I think some of my calls dropped even the stock went up ytd. So maybe u wanna check out iv rank and percentiles before buying
What does it has to do with today?
vix is only down 3%

not too bad
Lmfao for real, WSB is retarded thinking that it‚Äôs going up bc of a Trump win, nah, Biden has Wall Street backing him, & amazon is crashing bc Biden said he‚Äôll make Jeff bezos pay his share of taxes from now on.    
    
Edit: GOLDMAN SACS personally said they‚Äôre hoping for a blue wave so the market will be less volatile & it‚Äôll be good overall for the economy
it needs stimulus for people to keep buying their shit, anyway might as well wait till after election

wall street is backing biden and democrat senators, hoping for a blue wave. 5X the wall street money going to blue vs red. And wall street is the single largest source of campaign finance.

So I wouldn't count on the market rallying if Trump pulls an upset.

Yes, but what‚Äôs scarier is that trump stocks did much better. DFEN GEO and oil all pumped harder on high volume. Though one can argue that‚Äôs due there being a lot more value in those stocks vs clean energy which has ran up hard in the last few months

Look imma be real with u chief. I tried for years to see both sides and not be biased. You‚Äôll notice this sub leans left as well. Truth is, republicans (not all but the current state of the party) are propagandists who prey on the ignorant, morally bankrupt, and religious. You don‚Äôt hear about dems doing bad things because the scale that they do bad things is nowhere near the scale at which republicans do them. Yes they are corrupt, yes they are hypocrites, yes they go too far and are overly obnoxious on many issues. 

But what it boils down to is you‚Äôre asking to give some comparisons against a landfill versus a trash can. Yeah I can point out all the trash in the can, but is it really that relevant when the other option is a landfill filled with thousands of times more trash.

That‚Äôs the gist. Bad things are: still corporatists who take money from big business like pharma, Wall Street, gas, etc. yet claim to want to police them. They are also corrupt, no doubt. It‚Äôs just they are beholden to voters who actually care about it and members of their own party who do as well so because of that they can‚Äôt be blatant about it and uncaring. This does seem to work better than Republicans who don‚Äôt care that they are corrupt and actively root out the non corrupt ones. Ie: primaried any GOP Congressman who said they‚Äôd like to do action on climate change. 

And you look at the establishment and they just really suck. The main fault of a democratic system is that it is beholden to the voters (which also happens to be the main strength lol.) so the crime bills in the 90‚Äôs were also so so bad and passed by dems even though they were awful. But republicans used buzzwords (https://youtu.be/X_8E3ENrKrQ) to capture bigoted voters and started winning a lot with the war on drugs and cracking down on crime. So dems kept losing that battle so bill Clinton adopted that language as well. Which allowed him to win back then and pass a horrible crime bill that screwed over a lot of people with over policing that just doesn‚Äôt work. Biden and Hillary also involved in this and they are the recent and current faces of the party. And you see Trump attack them for it.

The political game is a hard one because if the voters are dead wrong or ignorant or bigoted, in order to win you have to appeal to them. So the dems have failed and done bad things as a result of that. But normally it‚Äôs because republicans started to do so in the first place and forced the dems hand lest they lose more and more. 

This is why people always say both parties are the same. Republicans do something to get an edge, normally something morally reprehensible, dems follow it to take away the edge. Average people get screwed: war on crime, using racially motivated language like ‚Äúsuper predators‚Äù, taking money from big money, I could go on. 

The most recent being the Supreme Court debacle. Republicans do an unprecedented measure and don‚Äôt allow an Obama appointee Merick garland to be appointed even though he‚Äôs centrist and a compromise. Instead McConnell stalls, ‚Äúwait til after election‚Äù even though that‚Äôs never happened ever and is a blatant cheating tactic. Then trump wins boom they get a super conservative judge in. Then similar situation comes up and ginsberg dies and then dems (try to) do the same as republicans did with Scalia dying during Obama. Then everyone is like wow dems are hypocrites both are the same. If you have the brain of a goldfish yeah they are hypocrites. But if you understand how setting precedents work then you‚Äôll understand that a new normal was set by republicans and if dems had any hope to retain power they‚Äôd have to play their same game. But the republicans win either way because if dems do nothing then they consolidate more power and if dems try to fight them they can say they are hypocrites. And what‚Äôs funny is they got both bc dems suck at the political game so they got called hypocrites and let a religious nut job with no judge experience take the seat. 

Which gets to the final point which is that dems suck at playing politics. They just lose and lose and lose and lose bc they don‚Äôt play dirty until it‚Äôs too late. They never have the upper hand. And they are short sighted and get called out for it later when they stoop low. 

Bernie is just about the only one who played the long game and almost won. He stuck to what he knew was actually correct and it almost worked at the highest level. He still won though and radicalized millions to go farther left. 

So yeah, you can tell I‚Äôm left leaning so whatever you can say my info is biased. (And also bias is a term used by those without facts on their sides to discredit.) bias doesn‚Äôt really exist, not at the level people think it does. I‚Äôll just tell you that i spent many years trying to understand both sides and see what they were saying and I can‚Äôt deny reality anymore. Republicans are a sham of a party built on ignorance, corruption, and bigotry. 

Somethings are just true, they are facts. Climate change is real and literally scientifically proven and there‚Äôs only one party in the country that acknowledges that. Doesn‚Äôt that make you think? There‚Äôs literally something we know is real, the world knows is real, based on hard data, and 50% of the politicians in the country don‚Äôt believe it.... I can‚Äôt trust the opinions of people who are so fundamentally wrong on an issue as to deny reality, how can you trust anything else they say? 

So when you ask, what are dems doing that‚Äôs wrong. I laid it out, I hope. And you also answered your question. The reason people don‚Äôt say the things dems are bad about is not that reddit is overly biased, it‚Äôs thats it just doesn‚Äôt exist even a little bit the same as the republicans. It‚Äôs just not the same. It‚Äôs landfill with only trash, versus a trash can with trash in it and like maybe a few still sealed bags of candy. 

Anyways, hope you like my wsb thesis, this subreddit despite its stupidity, faces reality head on because the everyone‚Äôs bottom line in here is based on reality. That‚Äôs why nio goes up and oil goes down despite what republicans spew. It‚Äôs just not the same between dems and republicans which Is why you don‚Äôt see the bad dems do on reddit, not here or elsewhere besides r/donald_trump lol

I could talk about this all day so if you read this, that‚Äôs dope. If not, hey I organized my thoughts at least lol

yeah that is what everyone is thinking, but what happens if banks decide not to lend because rates are to low? then you don't get an increase in the money supply, bonds skyrocket because of all the QE, the market crashes because of a lack of cash, everybody rushes to bonds that are rising rapidly, banks sell you the overpriced bonds and buys back the equities at a huge discount, and they play everyone
And we're green. For now.

You = banned, NIO = bankrupt
paypal or visa monthlies?
Been using this strategy since I found this sub around November last year. Hasn‚Äôt failed me yet. Just have to wait a bit. Most recent one was snap puts a nice 48% on those. Next one is NIO sub 32
We‚Äôre up like 1-2% literally every night and every single day you guys manage to convince me to buy puts
Personally I‚Äôm a long time NIO investor and very bullish with the company. Here‚Äôs why:

It's looking really good for them. Several financial firms have upgraded their forecasted market value for NIO. Made a lot of headline news from the upgrades. This is what's causing the boom right now. Other things NIO has going for them..

1. China has more people who drive than there are people in the United States. Having a huge consumer market without even going international. If they go international shares will double again. 

2. The Chinese Government is requiring that 25% of all vehicles are EV by 2025. By 2040 or 2050 banning all combustible engines. 

3. A huge pension fund just sold their Apple and Intel stock to buy NIO. Source: https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-sold-apple-stock-intel-bought-nio-zoom-video-51604003963

4. They are upping their production levels from 50k a year, to 150k next year. 300k in 2-3 years.

5. Their cars all immediately sold, always on back order for 6 weeks for every consumer. They just can‚Äôt manufacture them fast enough. Once manufacturing is updated it will double, and they will become profitable. It took Tesla several years to make profit from their vehicles.

6. The government of China has invested over a billion dollars in NIO to ensure they will be around for awhile. It‚Äôs a basically a government backed secure investment.

Ultimately, they really do produce high quality products. It‚Äôs impressive offering different concepts than Tesla‚Äôs market. NIO vehicles have batteries that can easily be swapped in 3 minutes for a full charged fresh battery. Reaching more consumers who don‚Äôt have garages, and live in apartments. 

Here‚Äôs a cool video featuring the NIO on YouTube: https://youtu.be/hTsrDpsYHrw

$500 dollar bet placed. Mods. In order to remain professional our bet is sealed and there is no need for additional arguments. I fully intend on paying $500 to this person if Trump loses. If trump wins I expect to be credited $500.. In order to maintain professionalism post will be archived and.not responded to until a winner is determined. I will post this once a winner is determined whether I am the victor or not. If I am not the victor a screenshot of payment will be included. If debt is.not paid I graciously request a ban for the debtor.

What on that chart says a pullback is coming? It‚Äôs literally a fucking staircase!
The effects are truly spread overtime. Like education spending will increase productivity over the next 60+ years. Similar effects for all policy. 

But the stock market is forward looking and if people expect increased taxes on capital gains coming in a few months, they may start selling off early to avoid bag holding. So libertarians would say ‚Äúyeah the markets always tank at the end of our presidential cycle, because the political pendulum is coming and investors* are trying to sell off before the communists get into power.‚Äù

¬†Thank you very much.¬† Thank you.¬† So beautiful out here.¬† And thank you for joining us as we announce a massive and groundbreaking concession.¬† And as you know, it‚Äôs already setting records ‚Äî records like nobody has ever seen before.  Concession talks are going well.  Voters voted.  We set records, incredible records, world leaders are calling me saying these are the most incredible concession numbers they've ever seen.  I still may fire Fauci, I don't know.  They say I will. When the pandemic struck, there were zero concessions for the China virus, but we‚Äôve marshaled all of America‚Äôs resources to achieve these unparalleled capabilities.

We slashed red tape and approved emergency concession authorizations for.¬† That‚Äôs how great the concessions are that we have.¬† I invoked the Article 112 and made more concessions than any other president ever has before.

We‚Äôve done nearly twice as many concessions per capita as France, Italy, and Germany, and over six times more concessions per capita than South Korea.¬† We‚Äôve done far more than any other country, usually times two, three, four, five, or six.¬† We‚Äôve performed nearly 40 million more concessions than India. These really are incredible concession numbers. Oh before I forget take these pens, here you go.  Crooked Hilary would have never brought you pens, but I did.  You know I had these pens.  Alot of people said I didn't have these pens.  But i have these pens. More pens than anyone has given out before.

With that I'd like to announce I've formed a concession task force.  I've appointed Bill Barr to oversee these concessions.  People say this will be the greatest concession task force ever..thats what they say.

Ah ok this gives me some confidence. Good luck man.

Holy pump
Is someone having a temper tantrum
Which broker do you use to double margin? Will Robinhood let you double margin spreads? Margin doesn‚Äôt count for options in Robinhood. Also, how much can you make a month with $300,000 doing this strategy.

This is why i don't understand why zoomers have such euroboners.  This is where collectivism leads you.  Cultural homogeneity counter to America's individualism and multiculturalism.
How can I salvage the immense assfucking I‚Äôm going to take from my VXX calls? I made it so long without blowing up my account, I guess eventually we all become truly retarded.
Except he‚Äôs going to win.
It's looking really good for them. Several financial firms have upgraded their forecasted market value for NIO. Made a lot of headline news from the upgrades. This is what's causing the boom right now. Other things NIO has going for them..

1. China has more people who drive than there are people in the United States. Having a huge consumer market without even going international. If they go international shares will double again. 

2. The Chinese Government is requiring that 25% of all vehicles are EV by 2025. By 2040 or 2050 banning all combustible engines. 

3. A huge pension fund just sold their Apple and Intel stock to buy NIO. Source: https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-sold-apple-stock-intel-bought-nio-zoom-video-51604003963

4. They are upping their production levels from 50k a year, to 150k next year. 300k in 2-3 years.

5. Their cars all immediately sold, always on back order for 6 weeks for every consumer. They just can‚Äôt manufacture them fast enough. Once manufacturing is updated it will double, and they will become profitable. It took Tesla several years to make profit from their vehicles.

6. The government of China has invested over a billion dollars in NIO to ensure they will be around for awhile. It‚Äôs a basically a government backed secure investment.

Ultimately, they really do produce high quality products. It‚Äôs impressive offering different concepts than Tesla‚Äôs market. NIO vehicles have batteries that can easily be swapped in 3 minutes for a full charged fresh battery. Reaching more consumers who don‚Äôt have garages, and live in apartments. 

Here‚Äôs a cool video featuring the NIO on YouTube: https://youtu.be/hTsrDpsYHrw

Stage 1, buys off brand items and lives paycheck to paycheck.   Stage 2, buys on brand regularly, and can splash out without hurting on a meal / a household item like a laptop, but doesn't regularly.
Stage 3, doesn't worry about getting value from purchases and regularly stays at the more expensive hotels as this doesn't affect their wealth.

If results turn to shit and the media can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt project a winner the market will reflect that uncertainty. Otherwise it‚Äôs green all week bbys
Who said market is pricing in Biden. R u a retard. No wonder u r losing money
Futures very much matter
good choice
there is ZERO chance Mango conceeds tonight
Give a look at early voting polling in the last two days. It‚Äôs much different proportionally than what you saw in the month leading up when polling was focused on a different demographic. It skews the way data is perceived
Dropped 20% within a week thus likely an oversold bounce/short squeeze
is anyone holding weed stocks during election
Y‚Äôall I‚Äôve gotten about 4 hours of sleep in the past 42 hours and I don‚Äôt think sleep is in the cards for me tonight. Election got me jittered.

Should I just pop another addy and pound a cold brew to the dome and just keep it going and start getting work done? Or turn off my phone and lay with my thoughts for another 2 hours til the sun comes up?

Historically a state like CA has received close to the national average in federal funds per person. And in regards to tax revenues you do understand that the top 1% contribute the largest proportion of income taxes. So a state like CA with high income executives from companies like Facebook and Salesforce are paying most of that tax. Exclude them and the federal tax revenue collected from the rest (the majority) of the state population really isn‚Äôt contributing that much.  We‚Äôll see soon enough how long this federal funds donor status holds up for CA when companies like Tesla consider leaving for states like Texas and Nevada. On a side note, thank you for the SALT deduction caps ,TCJA 2017 ü§ó.
The people in this sub are so naive . As if election outcome matters ? Ever heard of the FED ? QE? why you think they putting Jerome Powell on all those stupid magazine covers recently . The president is a puppet . You are all fools. Only good bet is on inflation
I have $1000 how should I play the market ?
Are we ready for another day of people whining about waiting to buy a nio dip but pussying out when the dip comes
Dude if you think people are somehow buying US stocks and holding them in euro value, you are legitimately braindead.

A broker based in Europe might handle the exchange for you and show you a value in euros, but the value of the stock is pegged to USD, and they will be sold in USD on the fucking market exchange when a European sells them.

So if a European buys US stocks and DXY drops, they are effectively losing value as they are holding a foreign equity in USD, which is dropping as compared to their local currency. 

The fact that I actually have to explain this to you is downright hilarious, frankly.
^^^^^^GUH
what if you would have put just one more dollar into there just think about that
Definitely, I don‚Äôt think this was a race thing. What people are saying where I live is that if people are willing to shoot people over a Trump sign, will they lose their shit if trump loses? 

Clearly, they don‚Äôt own property. It wasn‚Äôt about the sign, it‚Äôs about theft and trespassing. 

Still stupid to shoot tho. I would‚Äôve understood that he‚Äôs not a really popular guy and that people might do shit to the stupid sign either ways. And I lean left
funny I was gonna ask if you lived in the midwest but I didn't want to dox you

This guy has a creepy mind for sure. If he thinks just because an older person plays an all-ages game that there is a creepy component it's projection for sure.
18.5% short puts on equity indices on twatter. Really think mm's going to let this tank so you get tendies? They going to wait till people sell their puts post election and drop it. Then we get some bs CNBC headline "market tanks as election result sinks in"
calls
üò∞
That‚Äôs fairly logical. It just seems... dangerous to think that since that would suggest everyone is basing off of polling from mail in and very early voting and the population proportionally leans left who does that. Strikes me as complacency for one side like in 2016 is dangerous and all. Gl with your position btw

If Biden wins, hes all about clean energy and the stock will go up...eventually. If Trump wins, stock will spike for a week and then plummet to make way for his clean coal expedition.

Also, they aren't buying US equities in euros, bro. US equities have a USD value. So if anything, they would just lose more when they sell their stock and covert back to euros.

The market is inherently more likely to go up than down, and it takes true balls of steel to bet on this failing. Wouldn‚Äôt it then follow that the bulls are in fact gay, as they merely profit off betting that the market will go up similar to how rain falls from the sky?

I think I'm just going to stay cash gang like a little bitch until the election is decided, but at least I have a plan:

Yes. You are the smart money
Elections are priced in bro.. Politic heads and smart money already know... They just aren't allowed to talk about it... It's a power game of the influencers and the influenced and right now the mainstream media is 'all in' on their ability to 'influence'.....
yes
Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again.

if its a swing state ill vote. it's very fucking far from being a swing state. if the electoral college goes away, I'll vote.
I talked with my dad today about how I paper handed my last two plays and both of them mooned once I was out. I was really pissed watching all my uvxy and sqqq tank while the calls I exited Friday for a loss were at a net profit for me today. 

He said to hold. Every time I bought something I had a reason, yet I paper handed when it wasn't working out only to watch it moon later. He was like "don't do that again, if you had a plan, see it through."

Who knows, could turn out poorly, but maybe Wednesday will be a huge sell off if the election goes really bad or Biden wins and trump says he won't leave office or something insane like that. All I know is I'm sick of giving up before I've even given it a chance.
Oh my god majulah moment right here guys.

I'm guessing he was quite young? Granted I've always had 'stuff' in my house, especially a sofa etc, but as I've approached 30 I've got way more into just making my house look nice and really considering the 'style' in the house and individual rooms. Before it was just a house I lived in, now I feel the need to make it into my home.

That really only came when I started living by myself and was emphasised this year because I'm staring at the walls 24/7. But like you say, if he's got a bunch of empty rooms, maybe he's just not bothered/thinking about what the rooms could be used for.

This is kinda funny ngl
You're welcome to read up on your history and pull data from the agencies to try and tie that to the market. 

I don't personally think what you're saying is impactful beyond the very short term initial reaction of election considering that actual policies would take a bit before they're even gone into effect. If a tax cutter gets elected, wouldn't the market be affected when changes goes into effect, which would be well into their elected term rather than expectations of a newly elected official at time of election? 

Even then, you're looking at only the stock market or GDP. Democrats consistently outperform Republicans in multiple measures, not just GDP. I'm talking about Poverty, Standard of Living, Unemployment, Growth of Median Income etc. Which imo would mean policy is a pretty major factor.

Reasoning to why I sold my house: 
My house was extremely overvalued. The housing market in my area is forecasted to drop substantially next year. With over 25% of homeowners on the verge of foreclosure next year I decided to sell my home it it‚Äôs peak price. 

I was basically living paycheck to paycheck to keep up with the mortgage payments anyway. Lost my job, and said fuck it. I‚Äôve been eyeing NIO all year waiting on the sidelines thinking about buying. Then finally decided to pull the trigger. Had I acted sooner, like back in May, I would have been a millionaire by now just on NIO alone. So far this past month, I‚Äôve made more on NIO in one month, than I have with my regular annual salary.

Hmmm seems like 90% of this sub is balls deep in puts . Everybody dead silent rn and downvoting every bull comment
wtf no, that's like saying to a depressed bum to go inside a crack house, not a good idea
I hope he is, dude.
add an extra layer of protection before someone takes away the rest of your lifesavings

I only knew people who were thinking about it assuming biden was gonna be an actual centrist.  They seemed to have drifted back to the right.  They still think trump is trash and an embarrassment, but feel biden is too far to the left.
We are if you say something stupid or you insult someone who can‚Äôt defend themselves. Other than that we‚Äôre pretty chill

Probably safest to go cash and stay home for a few days. It won't be *terrible* either way, but definitely spicier than usual. Anticipate some supply shortages and non-essential businesses to be temporarily closed in certain areas. Just treat it like hurricane season or some other natural disaster preparation. Lots of places near me boarding up, full grocery carts, people filling gas cans. Nothing too concerning but there's people out there genuinely fearful that will be snatching up more than their share of supplies. Remember the March TP crisis. üöΩ

You dont think it will be a bit too late buying after the election results are done? Perhaps slightly sooner?
Also, i must add, that market rally after election results seems almost too obvious, doesent it? Although i do believe it will become self-fulfilling prophecy at least for this week.
It's shameful to be firmly associated with either party these days.

I swear man, they all ran up on shit earning and stimulus hopes before( like most over 75%). Now they get good to great earnings and they crash. Fucken Amazon and PayPal.

There's a decent chunk of them I've met.  From hardcore republicans who are tired of Trump's crap, to dem/3rd party voters who bucked to Trump last time but now are desperate to vote for the other guy no matter who it is.  


And unfortunately, some people who hate Trump but will vote for him again because he has the (R) tag.

The definitive answer is 2.5 million. That‚Äôs because couples worth 5 million net worth have easier divorces. They can say f u easier and still not care

Super long run 10+ years, more than likely no... the only hope is currently technology for long distances with heavy load isn‚Äôt there yet for a pure battery play.  So the hope is there is a nice window where HYLN can dominate the market as one of the only viable solutions until batteries catch up... also another hope is that everyone will be focusing on trying to capture the car market and won‚Äôt have a ton of capital to invest in the big 18 wheeler market until batteries get much much better and that transition to create a pure EV class 8 truck becomes much simpler.


My suggestion is if you want buy a small position before the call, but wait until all the shares are unlocked before dumping a ton of money in it ... also I‚Äôm bag holding a bit so that‚Äôs where I stand

Yea but if you are setting the strike at like 60 bucks you get the profit from the sale at 60 plus the premium from all the WSB tards who think its gonna hit 60 bucks if it makes it there. I mean you can make your strike anything you want and however long out you want. Find a strike you are comfortable with and sell those calls, there are a lot of people who buy dumb options, take advantage.

>For instance, I've done research science (various radiation hardness tests relating to computer components so we can do better physics). 

Sure a little evil, as those are used in nuclear rockets that have to endure the radiation of space. You are helping facilitate the delivery of nuclear warheads onto your own people.

>It's science for science's sake, with maybe eventual applications once we understand the world better.

This is what is called in the bible "the anti Christ" not that I'm gonna strongly take that angle, but its obvious that pure science isn't helping and this world is going to shit.

>I have colleagues and friends that have done a large number of other things. E.g. applying drones and robots to agriculture to save water and improve yields. Or control algorithm research so that assembly line machines can move faster and last longer. One of my co-workers worked on network analysis at the switching level to track the spread of malicious worms across the internet.

This excessive complication is like "the weaver" tarot card. The spider gets caught in its own web. You and others are making the world too complicated to understand, and therefore impossible to diagnose and deal with.

A movement towards simplicity is necessary and needed, that includes scaling back the complexity of technology.

Germany wasn't that close to a nuke. Pretty sure they also had issues sourcing uranium, and the resources for their program became diverted and siphoned off to the rocket program. 

They'd also have issues delivering the warhead because of British long distance radar. They were also getting bombed to shit, like Dresden where 40,000 were burned to death, which was as bad as a nuke attack. But Germans bad because they are Germans, got it.

>That page describes the issues a prostate experiences (none of them blackening and shrinking), as well as describes what it's involved in (fluid secretion with a specific purpose in the ejaculate). No squirt gun action, no inflammation post-ejaculation. For a "disproving" kind of approach, this page states that it's the muscles at the base of the penis that propel ejaculate.

We're talking about something that occurs over a man's entire life here. You can't just stick a probe into a man's prostate and observe this in one day.

>No squirt gun action

thats not being honest is it? It kind of does work exactly like a squirt gun. The black dude that invented it was pretty smart, its the most basic design possible, and the male body also tends to be the most basic and practical design possible.

>Do you really want me to go find the specific action of the prostate? Your bladder doesn't fill with air when it empties. Neither do your intestines, or stomach. The action of the prostate isn't quite the same as those, but maybe a good analogy is salivary and sweat glands. They do not fill with air on expelling saliva, or sweat.

you are comparing the bladder with the prostate, which I don't think is valid. I don't think that the human body was designed to ejaculate. I think that its a function like vomiting. so it would make sense to me that the bladder doesn't get air, while the prostate could get air. And I also don't care if 99.9% of humanity disagrees with me. doesn't mean that they aren't wrong (they are)

also doesn't have to be a lot of air. just a tiny amount over a lot of time.

Also the expelling of the ejaculate is also a big factor. It's not supposed to go anywhere. Its just supposed to sit there and sit there. the act of having to produce new prostate fluid over and over and over again also creates irritation, and this overactivity also produces cancer. 

>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among Canadian men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). It is the third leading cause of death from cancer in men in Canada.

The whole notion of Biden winning means America going back to its old ways are so out of touch. You have to realise that in some ways media love trump because he is full of stories and with the stories come ratings and $.
When nobody pay attention to America, that‚Äôs where the buck stops

you thought the $rope meme was a joke?
Well, you should. I pay way less in tax rate as a small business owner than if I was an employee

I think people think loophole=secret. Loophole=way to reduce your taxes through deductions or credits. 

You do pay both sides of the social security tax when you are the business owner or self employed but there are so many more write offs. 

Have a home office? Write off a portion of home internet, mortgage, cellphone, etc. Use your car for work? Write off miles. Have enough expenses to itemize deductions on your taxes and it all snowballs from there. 

Make enough money where you can leave the profits in the company to invest? Start a C Corp to be taxed on the profits at a lower rate until you take the money out of the company. Compounding interest for the win. 

Want to own a plane? Buy it in an LLC. Rent it out 51% of the hours it flys a year and write off 100% of the depreciation on an accelerated basis. Same goes for a yacht. 

Make a lot of money and want the best way to create generational wealth? Buy apartment buildings and pay relatively little taxes (compared to normal income) through various write offs including depreciation and capitalizing any improvements. Just stay liquid and over time the small rent increases will build. 

Think of this. Buy a rental for $10,000,000. Put $2,000,000 into repairs, thereby adding value so the building is now worth $14,000,000. Net income on the rental is $700,000. However, since you had ‚Äúexpenses‚Äù of $2M you don‚Äôt pay any tax on that income for about three years plus you are also deducting depreciation despite the fact that the building is actually worth way more than you bought it for not less! 



As an aside, there used to be a tax deduction for buying a Range Rover. When you‚Äôd go to the dealer they‚Äôd give you a pamphlet explaining it. Basically, any vehicle over 6,000 pounds qualified for an accelerated depreciation schedule. I think the law was written to apply to farm equipment but a Range Rover ended up qualifying. I believe this loophole was since closed and I would think the private plane one gets closed eventually too.

Healy claims that RNG is carbon negative, so that, "In a weird way driving the truck is actually better for the environment"
This comment always struck me as a bit of an oversell. I understand the gist, that capturing methane from decaying feedstock that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere offsets the emissions from the truck, but the Hyllion drivetrains do produce carbon and particulate matter. 
It seems like a lot of environmentalists are becoming less supportive of so-called transitional solutions, in favor of pure play zero-emissions like full EV and hydrogen.
Will Hyllion be able to sell RNG hybrid engines as a viable green technology in the long run?

General Dynamics?  Boeing?  Raytheon? Is that you?
> but you actually haven't bothered to counter my point about the people behind science. these people are absolute animals. the people who invented nuclear weapons for example and utilized them on people.

Would you like to talk about a specific scientist? I can't prove or disprove some blanket statement about a large group of people. Certainly there are folks that take money from outside interests and let that influence their results, but they are not in the majority.

For instance, I've done research science (various radiation hardness tests relating to computer components so we can do better physics). I've done algorithm research for rejecting large volumes of noise. Are those evil? It's science for science's sake, with maybe eventual applications once we understand the world better.

I have colleagues and friends that have done a large number of other things. E.g. applying drones and robots to agriculture to save water and improve yields. Or control algorithm research so that assembly line machines can move faster and last longer. One of my co-workers worked on network analysis at the switching level to track the spread of malicious worms across the internet.

Are they, or their research, evil?

I also wouldn't use WW2 and nuclear weapons as an argument for the "evils" of science. The people working on this weren't evil, and nuclear research has plenty of civilian applications. Nuclear energy, and especially modern reactor designs, are one of the cleanest forms of energy we have. It just wasn't a particularly good time for humanity in general.

[Did you know that Germany was extremely close to a nuke?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nuclear_weapons_program) Had the war lasted longer, would you want Nazi Germany to be the only world power with nukes?

Most modern science, by the way, teaches ethics alongside the general curriculum. If you want some further reading, take a look at something like [A Gift of Fire](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Fire-Ethical-Computing-Technology/dp/0132492679) (programming specific).

> Ok i read what you linked there. absolutely nothing that was written in those wikipedia paragraphs disproves what i said

That page describes the issues a prostate experiences (none of them blackening and shrinking), as well as describes what it's involved in (fluid secretion with a specific purpose in the ejaculate). No squirt gun action, no inflammation post-ejaculation. For a "disproving" kind of approach, [this page states that it's the muscles at the base of the penis that propel ejaculate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculatory_duct).

> prove that its not air that is getting in there. there must be some blood or juice or some shit that immediately gets sucked back into the prostate to fill the significant volume of liquid that leaves it.

Do you really want me to go find the specific action of the prostate? Your bladder doesn't fill with air when it empties. Neither do your intestines, or stomach. The action of the prostate isn't quite the same as those, but maybe a good analogy is salivary and sweat glands. They do not fill with air on expelling saliva, or sweat.

> if you cant find something that fills that void then its obviously air

No. That's reaching. It is not "obviously air." It _may_ be air, if we didn't know anything about the prostate, but we do. If it's obvious to you, please provide support for your obvious assumption. Things that are straightforward should be easy to prove.

> what do you think there is a black hole or wormhole in your prostate or something? its immune to the laws of physics?

It's not. But I expect it functions like any number of glands on your body, none of which fill with air when active.

He never has before, there is no reason to think he will now.
Isn‚Äôt the disadvantage to a covered call something like, if NIO goes higher than I anticipated I would have lost those gains?

Seems like it. I think the mistake was dems put all their eggs in the mail in voting basket, under the premise that higher turnout benefits them. Normally it benefits them cause the increase is normally because they are driving their target demos to the polls. The problem here is they sent ballots to the whole population. Once you do that, you have no control over who votes and who doesn't. Trump does like 4 two hour stand up special infomercials daily, so no surprise if that is a call to action to mail those in.
Off the top of my head 

1) accelerated depreciation
2) keeping profits offshore to avoid US tax
3) offshoring what should be American profit
4) segmenting a business to create pass through opportunities
5) sweetheart gov contracts from  your gov cronies
6) playing municipalities against each other for the best tax breaks on your physical locations (see tesla and amazon for examples)
7) stock option compensation programs 
8) carried interest 
9) the use of C corps 
10) intellectual property deductions 

Bonus! 
11) industry specific subsidies like for energy companies 

Rich person Bonus!
12) holding assets in various trust schemes 

Many, if not most, large corporations pay far far less that the quoted corporate tax rate. Corporations have bought all sides of our government so that isn‚Äôt going to change as long as people want to be re-elected.
Every stock in my portfolio beat earnings, save one.

Every stock in my portfolio is down at least 5%.

Really? Only reason could be if you are 80years + and doubt living in 20 years or if you dont have the money
Bruh this election gonna be like everything wsb has predicted before. Whenever ppl think shit is gonna moon or crash it just stays flat, the outcome tomorrow or whenever it happens will be pretty normal imo
Kamala and Pence were +10,000 so I threw each $5. One of these old geezers could croak or concede to their own VP idk shit is crazy
You‚Äôre right on that. But, vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective and there are groups of people who are allergic to vaccines and babies who are too young to get vaccines.

With future inflation as a consideration and without the consideration of future employment/business income I think $5 Million at 1-2% draw down is enough to live/retire on if your under 40. If your over 40, 3-4% draw down on $2-3Mil would work too.

Top tier growth companies will have their down days or weeks but every dip is a buying opportunity.  Unlike SPY, they won't be rangebound between 250 and 350 for the next 5 years. That 50-100% annual upside is way better than maybe getting lucky on perfectly timing a 30% crash.

A chance of them is priced in.

If they happen, it's very likely VIX will increase quite a bit.  But they aren't guarantees.  So the market is pricing volatility such that there's a chance for these things to happen.  You're pricing it in your mind like they already have.
Damn Trump is really gonna win this thing
The party that's not in power is always full of shit. Dems couldn't pass healthcare when they controlled the Whitehouse and both houses of congress. Republicans couldn't repeal Obamacare after freaking out about it on Fox News for 4 years straight.

Dems will pass a bill with less than what they're offering now.

If you sold $50k apple shares after 2001 crash, you lost money and also missed out on $15m in 2020
If the democrats definitively take both the presidency and the senate there‚Äôs increased confidence in passing a stimulus this winter and that stimulus would be to the tune of $2.5T instead of $1T which is what it would be if the republicans retain both or if there‚Äôs a split.  Not to mention the prospect of no longer having a president who has a habit of tweeting whatever pops in to his brain and tanks the market as a result.
I think it‚Äôs going to be fucked for a few weeks regardless who wins, then it will recover.
The whole ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù thing is never actually true though. You‚Äôre really telling me that the (slim) possibility of a heavily contested election and the resultant civil strife, along with the worsening pandemic and economy are ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù with vix sub 40? It hit 82+ in March because of the market crash, which is minor shit compared to a possible civil war/Great Depression part 2.
This is one of the weaker talking points of the right.

Biden is 77.

Trump is 74 and morbidly obese.


If there was a deadpool, I know where I'd put my money.
No it‚Äôs just bc most people are too lazy to vote in person lol And now they can send thru Mail
I imagine "godspeed retard" being spoken by a vengeful and very serious Green Goblin-suited William Dafoe
I know that's conventional wisdom, but that's just a media ploy to get people who hate Biden to vote for him thinking they'll get Harris. I guarantee you that old man ain't going anywhere. He spent his whole life trying to be President and he ain't giving it up no matter what.

wyze cams cost $20 a pop. I can buy 10 of them and monitor every room in my house. I can view the cams on my phone from across the world.  These things are super cheap.
you are getting way ahead of yourself here with all this stuff. telling me all about science etc, yes I get it, science is great etc. but you actually haven't bothered to counter my point about the people behind science. these people are absolute animals. the people who invented nuclear weapons for example and utilized them on people. the consequences of such actions are not even completely realized yet. nukes are not gonna prevent war at all, wars just happen because of the way we are. so now we are really screwed thanks to these people.

>This is pure speculation and as far as I can find completely unsupported. From everything about the squirt-gun function, to air filling the gaps, to blackened and shrunk gland. Specifically cancer generally results in an enlarged prostate, although there are benign causes of this as well.

Ok i read what you linked there. absolutely nothing that was written in those wikipedia paragraphs disproves what i said

prove that its not air that is getting in there. there must be some blood or juice or some shit that immediately gets sucked back into the prostate to fill the significant volume of liquid that leaves it. 

if you cant find something that fills that void then its obviously air

When I talk politics, it‚Äôs all about the money. 

The President doesn‚Äôt pass the stimmy, he can decide whatever he wants, but it‚Äôs up to Congress to put the money up. Mitch and the GOP already do not agree with the dollar amount the Democrats have proposed. Claimed Democrats are trying to ‚Äúspend our kids money‚Äù. Bullshit aside, Biden wins = Mitch doesn‚Äôt pass the stimmy out of spite(I‚Äôm betting on this).

Even if Dems wins the Senate, they‚Äôre not in power till January. That‚Äôs 9 weeks. A lot can happen in the markets over 9 weeks. 

I mentioned this because seems a good deal of Bulls lately have been talking about  a stim pack as if its days away and are pricing the logic into their moves.
I personally believe once the pandemic is "over" there'll be a big jump in the entertainment industry in general. Movies, live performances, events.

If production is on hold, that means Netflix, Amazon, Disney aren't able to produce much content right now either. Netflix subscription prices are going up, Amazon Prime isn't a full membership and Disney isn't able to create as much blockbuster content then the movie studios are currently hoarding and will eventually get distributed through Netflix and Amazon. Don't forget YouTube is killing it right now also. 

Potential return on AMC is worth the gamble to throw a few bucks at it, Cinemark will for sure bounce back.
Wait for news or an event

Highly unlikely NJ already looking to pass some, same with Illinois and firms are evaluating plans to move if something happened there - and though it it will not. Nationwide - unlikely. Not relevant this week's trade.

> The general opinion is if trump wins it‚Äôs bullish for markets and if he doesn‚Äôt then markets go down.

WSB's opinion is not the opinion of most market participants. The stock market is in for major pain in the next coming years regardless of who is in office - Economists and traders believe a Biden victory would be far more beneficial for the economy and stock market (5-10 yr time frame)

Nonetheless this trade has a window of a week - maybe more if people really get excited and the virus calms down.

Edit: ahh yes, please more downvotes guys. This just reaffirms my position...same hypocrisy the media shoves down everyone‚Äôs throats.
My pops is a 25yr fed and his biggest concern is that the budget runs out Dec 1. If Trump loses, he has total right to just not sign the budget. It's so easy for me to believe he would blow up this country over his ego. Puts on literally everything all through December.

Like a Jackson Pollock Painting.
u have a point
> [sources/scientists involved/etc.]

Science is a process, and it's not immune to manipulation. There are even sayings in the field of statistics, to the tune of "if you torture the number enough, they can say almost whatever you want."

But it is _the_ process of iteratively trying to understand our world and arrive at supported conclusions. Definitely if common sense if being refuted (or we can't find any support for it), then the common sense should be re-examined. Common sense should, and does change based on this.

You can look at the progression of any scientific field. [Prior to the work of Francesco Redi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Redi), the common sense was that rotten meat generated maggots as it decayed. This is not true. Without access to egg-laying flies, life does not just spring forth from rotten meat.

[Prior to the work of Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius#Geography,_ethnology,_and_geology), people didn't really know if the Earth was flat or spherical. He not only "proved" that it was spherical (or at least curved), he also calculated the circumference to a pretty good degree of accuracy. Even now there are folks whose common sense tells them the world must be flat.

> common sense is not subjective, its meant to be objective, thats the point of "common sense"

If it is objective, it is science. What differs is rigorously trying to prove (and most importantly disprove) your hypothesis so as to figure out whether your musings are correct. The more you do this, the better your predictions and intuition might get.

> the prostate acts like a squirt gun ...

This is pure speculation and as far as I can find completely unsupported. [From everything about the squirt-gun function, to air filling the gaps, to blackened and shrunk gland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate#Function). Specifically cancer generally results in an enlarged prostate, although there are benign causes of this as well.

Otherwise, I'll read more about the 20% study, thanks for pointing out that it might be unsupported by further research (and that the source might be a bit quacky).

> they will collect their salaries, they will do a bunch of stupid stuff and basically nothing will get solved.

If you figure science is some kinda lucrative career, well ... research science is definitely not.
If you don‚Äôt get vaccinated it endangers the rest of the population. It‚Äôs a similar concept to making kids get vaccinations for public school, which we already do

Wall Street thinks the man is unstable and insane.  Biden clearly is a shell of his former self but is a stable adult and that‚Äôs all the market needs right now.  A Biden presidency will instill confidence in the market that would never be seen at this point under Trump.  If you‚Äôre operating on any other principle you‚Äôre clearly not paying attention.

Should I hold my $1000 of SPXS $6 calls 11/20
Well, at least somebody bought my puts a month ago for the same price. Almost earned 100% now. I cant see why volatility would go down leading into election but whether it goes up is always hard to forsee.
God, I cant wait for you americucks to finally be done with this election. You think you're gonna get it done this week or go full idiot like 2000?
You know it decays over time even with constant volatility? So like a 40 VXX in March is probably a 35 VXX now.
Infinitely larger than mine. I don‚Äôt even invest. This sub is just fucking hilarious
my office building is in SCRIPPS fucking RANCH. the most peaceful quiet place in north county so i cant believe this shit LOL
Yeah they all look shit, still not sold on pot as investable. Unlike iPhones and oil I can grow pot in my basement. Not much proprietary value there.
Long Calls and Huge Sacks: the WSB Story
Sell it all and put it in options.
its not really hard, its going big uppies but they dont want to pay off a lot of calls, so they went down and up and down again, which murdered basically everyone on wsb. so now we will go up. pretty simple really
it's called volatility
stonks do not only go up they can in fact slowly trend downwards
Let‚Äôs be honest, people who are voting for Biden aren‚Äôt voting for Biden, there voting to remove Trump...

check my post history, ive been posting here EVERY NIGHT since beginning of MARCH and still im in utter shock of VXX not being $40+ right now. this year never ceases to amaze me.
No shit
Wow. My accountant is holding out on all of these loopholes. I need to call him this week.

Missed you robot.
Sure. But what happens when capital gains taxes go up? Or if they pass a financial transaction tax on all securities and derivatives trades? Every boomer who‚Äôs ridden this bull market to its fullest the past 10 years will cash out before the changes go to effect. 

The general opinion is if trump wins it‚Äôs bullish for markets and if he doesn‚Äôt then markets go down. This is from a valuation and opportunity cost point of view. So you‚Äôre banking on the stimulus. If that‚Äôs the case might as well go long /GC futures instead of /ES if that‚Äôs the primary reason for the trade.
UPS strangles then?
Dude I wonder the same. So many variables. I miss the easy days of the post march recovery. No bad news could bring that shit down.

And yet they are donating unprecedented amounts of money to Biden and Democrat senate candidates and hoping for a blue wave.

You want a crash now,  so maybe in 3-6 weeks. Or months. 

Stop focusing on a crash that might never come,  start looking for companies that will beat the market over the next year.
You mean bankruptcy king
Honor system. Sure there maybe a few fakes, but the majority are probably near accurate or they would rather decline to state or post something funny.
you know of this thing called adblock?
Biden wins, but close enough for Trump to call it fake, throw a hissy fit, and refuse to deal on stimulus.  Covid keeps rising and one or two states go back into partial shutdown.  Markets panic.


Then Ivanka gently whispers sense into his ear... "It's over daddy time to go home.  Leave on a good note and you can make millions  raging against Biden.... maybe they'll even not try to throw us in jail if we play ball"  


"You're right babe, says Trump, and damn you really are hot."  With his legacy at stake Trump eventually passes a stimulus and fades not so quietly onto the speaker's circuit.


In all seriousness he is going to go apeshit after Biden wins and not want to pass stimmy.  That plus Covid panic why does anyone have calls?  Wait two weeks minimum.
It's pretty much unwatchable outside of a browser with adblock these days
My puts getting their pooper gaped

Sounds fucked to me. I'm a cell bio major and even i can't understand the argument for forcing people to be vaccinated. The shut down is to prevent people from being infected, so if every person has the option to be vaccinated against infection where do the restrictions come into play?

If you don't want to get vaccinated, that's your risk. If you die, it's your fault.

Prepare for downvotes my comrade. Pro Trump, anti Biden- insta downvote
Eliminates the risk. Its for the weak.
I heard futures don't matter.. but why would the market move anyway before news comes out
Yes it is proven by dental association. Many gum brands have the seal on them.
No give me the flair instead fuck this guy
lil pimp
It's not about the party, it's about the premise.

The reason why stocks rose so spectacularly this summer was because of the historic stimulus that was put forth to distract everyone from the economic impact of Coronavirus (forbearance programs and the Fed saying that they would backstop with 0% aided that). 

Now the markets are falling because speculators are concerned that stimulus won't pass soon. 

So if Trump is re-elected, the stimulus will be passed quickly. The Democrats won't have a reason to wait anymore and Trump won't care. It's not coming from his bank account.

If Biden is elected, you'll have to wait until next year for stimulusm Probably at least February before another stimulus deal, because McConnell will hold it up until he can't anymore. You really think Trump would care at that point? Again it's not his money and his focus will be sourcing as much paper and ink as possible to pardon as many people as possible. 

It's great that people talk about how awesome Democrats are historically with the economy, but it's a special year. Trump and his team has pumped up assets as they have never been pumped up before. Forbearance programs are inflating assets. Pandemic Unemployment Insurance is paying people more to be on unemployment than they were paid when they had a job. Biden cannot possibly spend enough to juice everything more. You would have to spend $3-4 trillion to do that.

What would likely happen is you'll see a reduction in asset prices to some sort of a low and then a steady climb back up as businesses start to turn around. It won't be the rocket ship you saw in April, May, and June.

I remember back in the day when you could at least *kinda* feel good about your position based on futures.

If futures were big green, they usually stayed that way, or at least didn't fall off a cliff.

These days it's like deep red, then deep green, then europe opens and it's deep red, then premarket opens and it's deep green, then the market opens and we fall off a cliff, then it fucking rallies to +2% at 1pm for some reason.

And it's just like, good fuck, nothing means anything anymore, lmao.

Pro tip, id buy your bullshit a little easier if you didnt try to claim you made 80k in highschool from tutoring of all things.

If that were the case half my friends would be rich as fuck right now. 

Id buy that you left highschool with *maybe* 5-10k, maybe even 15k if you lived in a rich area growing up and just pocketed it all. But no way in fuck you made that obscene amount of money just by tutoring.
Man if you are making 123k a year and your net worth is only 380k your doing something wrong lol no it's satrical but still lol
I like this as a possibility as well.
People are still quarantining? I feel like at this point you‚Äôre working from home (means you‚Äôre rich or have a cushy job) or if you‚Äôre blue collar you‚Äôre back on the frontlines as an ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù, basically sent to die so karen and randy can have their fast food

Thanks bro! If you‚Äôre in long term, like holding between 1-5 years it‚Äôs not too late. It‚Äôs bound to drop a bit here soon. But I don‚Äôt see it going below 28-29 again. It is likely to be over 60 a share next year. 

I was eyeing it at 20 a share last month. Waiting for it to drop below 20, and it never happened. So I bought in at 21, and it shot off into space. It‚Äôs a risk, but long term it won‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt wait when it hit 21.

Yeah, but I will say that AP is an american non-profit, and it might legitimately be the most objective news source on earth. It's pretty nutty the lengths they go to to ensure that all of their reporting is neutral. It's just straight up news with no loaded words, angles, or opinions.

Damn you sound triggered, snowflake!
I've been having this debate with friends for MONTHS. Once a vaccine is widely available, does it even matter how many people take it? Is it the govt's role to make people take it? Once it is available and enough time had passed (who knows how long that will be) that everyone who wants a dose could have it, does the govt have any right to restrict commerce or travel based on the disease? Lots of questions made prevalent by the USA's resistance to basic medical science. Fun times ahead!
Just so we can focus on facts, what is the percentage of a population that needs to be infected before herd immunity is reached?

I use AP as my #1 news source for written content.

I don't trust reuters *as much* as I used to, as they sold a majority stake to fucking blackstone of all people in 2018. AP is non-profit. So I always go AP over reuters, but I agree reuters still seems fairly legit.

But everyone else basically gets their news from AP/reuters anyway and warps it, so you might as well just go directly to the source.
Too low. Bottom of a move down will likely come in around 3130. If we do close below that, it's straight carnage till 2850 IIRC.

Federal versus state separation of powers. President can tell a state to open up but if a state's governor doesn't then that's the difference.

Nah if Biden wins whole sector might get a bump even if they are a shit company
Getting paid later is always a better option then not getting paid at all. 

Growing up as a teen I heard a story about Trump and Ceasars Palace in Atlantic City. Crap casino was underwater for a long time, but never went into bankruptcy (90s), because the majority of the debt was held by the banks. They never foreclosed on Trump because they would've been left with an eyesore of a property worth waaay less than what they had tied into it. 

Similar to why Hospitals will work out a payment plan instead of sending the bill directly to creditors (make more money, then selling the debt for pennies on the dollar). Similar to why during this shit show of a year, even if there wasn't payment deferral protections for jobless people, banks would be stupid to foreclose on millions of homes, being stuck with all that property to offload for pennies on the dollar. 

Some group recently floated AMC some cash. In order to protect that money they would have to float more cash. I'm sure they have some level where they will call it a wash, but if they are flush with cash, payment put off is better than no payment at all. 

Sometimes it's better to float the debt until better times show up. AMC isn't fucked because of a shitty business model, it's fucked because of a pandemic. If the pandemic was gone tomorrow they would survive again (more debt of course). 

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading this ramble. 

AMC is a gamble at the moment, but honestly it's a gamble that might pay off. I mean SHIT. the premium is dirt cheap for options out to Jan 21 2022. Two years out. It's a gamble, but it's a cheap gamble. Would I pick up more than a handful of 21 Jan 22 5C; probably not. But a small percentage would be worth the pay off. In fact I will pick up a couple those calls for shits and giggles.

Good luck bro, but do no more than that. Take time off enjoy it buy something tangible if u have to, so you dont spend it back in robinhood. Make a downpayment,, pay off a car anything other than trying to flip it. That was my problem. Back when I was only 8k deep I made back 6 and had 5 left in my account. All my Bill's paid a year out so I threw it all back in and have been throwing back in more weekly. I can afford to but I wish I hadn't and that feeling of regret hurts more then then wondering the what if plays I could've made since I can only do 200-300 a week.

Best of luck to you man be smart. If you cant be smart hire someone to do it for you /an accountant peace bro

After the amazing volatility and returns that ü•≠ has provided all of us...you guys talk about only caring about the color green...you guys are doing him dirty to turn your back on him now!
I just bought 35 acres in Vermont in Feb. Been a wild transition year but working outside all day + trading stonks is seriously the best of both worlds.
I see a pullback to 26-27 before it rockets again. 40 seems very likely.
I think the market is going green for either victory. fuk u bears
Bookie odds on Biden are way lower than the polls so on paper it looks like a pretty good bet. FiveThirtyEight has 90% chance of Biden win, while current bookie odds are paying the equivalent of 66% chance of Biden win.
Ohhhhh.
I think you just want to define the middle class as rich for some reason. You're not really offering anything to support this middle class being dead thing, poor people not being able to support a family of 5 isn't proof there is no middle class

Up voted you for the shitty mods.
love the enthusiasm
the sources thing doesn't work. people are intellectual animals. they are animals with an intellect. they engage in nuclear warfare with each other and act like barbarians.

doing the science is one thing. but the person doing the science also matters.

the fact that they take this shitty study by alfred kinsey and spread it everywhere speaks volumes about the people behind "science". the rest of his science was shit and this is acknowledged in university. but they still spread the shit anyways. because they are bestial and immature and want to spread a version of the truth that is convenient to their way of life

in a sexual behavior class in university, a very talkative girl spoke out loud in front of like 300 people about her sexual experiences etc. she used it as a hook up vehicle.

sex science stuff is barely academic, highly politicized and generally a waste of time

common sense is not subjective, its meant to be objective, thats the point of "common sense". the prostate acts like a squirt gun. it ejects the ejaculate out of the prostate into the open air. air must then rush in to fill the void, to some extent or another. this irritates the gland. eventually over the years, the inflammation leads to various forms of cell death. the gland blackens and shrinks. then all these old men need surgeries on their prostate due to the cancer that sets in. usually if it sets in twice, they are dead.

you wont find the prostate cancer research center or whatever come out with some study indicating the above. they will collect their salaries, they will do a bunch of stupid stuff and basically nothing will get solved. thats how this works in dumb dumb world

Why would stocks go down with Biden? Look at the charts comparing democratic to republican stock markets. Dems are better for the markets. Taxes will likely go up which takes a chunk out of profits but there will still be a million loopholes so it‚Äôll barely affects stocks.

Thanks for the detail. I've been asking around but no one can give a good answer; PLAY had a massive spike on announcement that their creditors permitted them to issue later-dated corporate bonds to repay their current bonds and immediate obligations. That was an agreement to modify the existing covenants. I assume it's a win win for all parties involved, but it could also be a sign that the creditors are more nervous of default than the company is of getting defaulted upon. What's to prevent this scenario from playing out with all the other distressed companies of this sector? I could see it happening to cruiselines, but who knows maybe they'll give AMC another year on their maturities. I don't really want half of distressed companies to become zombies, but at the same time it's frustrating to try to devise a play when a debt reprieve or denial amplifies the movement of these already overleveraged stocks.
bet you think anyone who disagrees with you is a radIcaL lEftist

All these polls showing Biden up by 6 or 7 points don‚Äôt let the audience know they‚Äôre sampling almost 20% more democrats than republicans. Which makes the propaganda even worse. Take advantage of the situation.
Will we actually know who will be President tomorrow night?
Will the warrants be available if shares are bought on Robinhood?
If you follow twitter there‚Äôs several who got the vaccine and confirms they had antibodies afterward . Search ‚ÄúPfizer antibodies‚Äù it‚Äôs remarkable

ATH was 3.5mil, now I'm about 2.2 mil after Monday's green day. Haven't sold my FSLY or TSLA stocks, but I did sold my FB to buy some AAPL and PSTH.
I want to say yes... eventually. The start of it's decline when it entered chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 2000s(02 or 03), a year later closed a few hundred stores, laid off 10s of thousands and sold property to stay solvent. 

It survived and thrived enough over the next decade to contemplate purchasing Sears for billions; ended up as  a merged instead and then it started it's decline into it's current subsidiary state. 

\----------------------

It's odd though as going forward given covid I feel like AMC is in a better position (then cruise ships). Much easier to sell a store on land then a billion dollar ship. The thing that is fucking with AMC (as they are open in some areas), is they have no new releases as studios NEED theaters filled to capacity to make up for production cost. All studios are still hesitant to release new films into the theaters until covid passes. 

If AMC wants to survive, it's going to have to come up with some sort of gimmick to constantly keep their 25%/35% max capacity seating full. Old movies wont do it. 

Answer that question and expect a lucrative position within the executive offices at AMC HQ.

> you are making a great assumption in that i limit myself to empirical data instead of common sense

I was thinking we were having a conversation to learn something. Re-phrased this is the equivalent of "feelings over facts." No offense meant, it's just not something that we can properly discuss when our common sense differs.

> in reality jerking off accounts for the rise in prostate cancer. jerking off makes it inflammed

I would want to see sources here. My common sense doesn't agree. There are a number of similar activities that, even if they cause short-term inflammation (e.g. muscles after a workout), are better for you long-term.

> people back in the 1900s didnt jerk off like they do now

Sure. Access to porn was a lot more limited; and there are some studies that showcase the detriments of porn addiction. But you don't have to pop open PornHub every time you jerk off if you're worried about those effects.

> cancer rates have risen, because of plastic etc but also cuz of jerking off

Plastics there's some evidence. A lot of the literature I've read also points to a a large effect of just better testing. I assume (and this is taking a large leap about you) that this resonates with your common sense given the current COVID situation. But it's not automatically an argument that masturbation is correlated with more prostate cancer.

The pandemic is over.
It was a complete nothing burger and we're just going to go herd immunity.
Literally only old people and obese people die, unironically nature doing its job of culling the weakest links of a herd.

Hot take: More people will die as a result of lockdowns due to economic downturn for possibly years to come.

In future when the death rate is so low from a flu like virus we may as well just ignore it and business as usual.
The response was disproportionate and you would could only justify it for something like a ebola pandemic.

Also we aren't really clear on how many deaths are covid deaths as there's been a strong financial and political incentive to claim everything as covid related.
Many of the usual causes of deaths have dropped to unprecedented low levels.
The standard yearly flu for example that kills many people every year has all but vanished mysteriously.
Many such cases.

At that age my life was worth no more than a few zips
lol? are you like 18
My scrotum.
Biden's national poll numbers are fantastic, the margin required of error is just too unlikely for trump to win the electoral college. State level polling is also quite excellent. Early voting is up 100% from 2016, 97 million ballots already counted. Turnout will be record numbers. High turnout is crucial for democratic victories. Democratic voters are highly energized and singularly unified - no matter what astroturfing happens online here and elsewhere.

Senate projections look extremely strong for democrats. 2018 midterm elections were a huge democratic sweep, they outperformed significantly. Why? The entire issue was trump on the ballot. The 2018 House change was the largest change of seats in decades - it was a complete destruction of republicans. In the 2 years since then had trump made ANY inroads with voters? Absolutely not, they hate him even more than they did then. The evidence leads to more likelihood of a blue sweep. Plain and simple - the EVIDENCE - not feelings - points to a massive democratic victory tomorrow. A massive victory completely destroys any chance for trump with legal shenanigans, further, we understand the results likely tomorrow night. It becomes apparent to all and his twitter becomes impotent to anyone that matters. All focus moves to the new Biden administration.

Now that the election has been understood there are the markets...

The market has been negative almost every single day for 2 weeks with worry and uncertainty. Not entirely electoral but nonetheless - there is an enormous amount of hot money waiting to get back in.

If there is a blue sweep in the election, the market is looking for a $2.2T stimulus at minimum - and the expectation is even up to $3-4T. Do you recall what happened last time we spent $3T dollars in printed funds? Stimmy checks flow to people, schools get billions of dollars, kids get a plan to go back to school, free vaccines, states get billions in funds for budgets, confidence will moon. The dollar will tank, and gold will be good - but stocks will finally get a lot of pent up fear crushed. Volatility will get destroyed - RIP all those UVXY posts i see.

Tech is still grossly overvalued, see DOW/SPX out performance today and right now in over night futures. Tech is valued already richly, bread and butter stocks, old school value will get a chance to catch up. Market action will move to COVID/stimulus talks going forward.

Long 5 /ES contracts aka $825k of SPY. https://i.imgur.com/1XQZxqF.png

This is my analysis, and it can be wrong in a few places but still leave me with a profitable trade. Worst case would be a trump victory, though highly unlikely - if that looks like that might happen, markets will implode - it may be short term, highly uncertain, but I think clearly negative - and I hope I can exit the position fast enough.

Then withdraw $90k. So I have $110k in my acc now.

It will say I‚Äôm up 1000% percent when I‚Äôm not and it will seem like I turned $10k -> $110k when I didn‚Äôt

SP is abbreviated for stock price. 
Let's say you bought SPY 325 puts and SPY goes up to $335 tomorrow at some point. At that time your puts will lose a lot of value because SPY price moved higher. If you think that it will fall from that $335 then you buy some more 325 puts so that your average purchase price of those SPY 325 puts become lower. When SPY falls to let's say $328, your puts will gain value. You might get out with minimal loss/small profit/break even. But if SPY goes up even more after your averaging down then your losses will be even bigger because now you have more positions.
Last time this happened was in 1960 when Nixon got all 5 first votes. He went on to lose the election.

I feel you man. What's shitty about being new traders now is that literally for the last 12 years you could've bought ANY blue chip or tech stock and just made money hand over fist guaranteed. Now we're faced with actual market uncertainty and manipulation and have to be WAAAAY more careful. The whole "stonks only go up" thing isn't even ckose to true anymore. We could be headed for YEARS of dogshit economic performance. At the very least we haven't even begun to pay the price of Covid
UPS wiped me out on er.  I can‚Äôt believe how much it fell post er.  Fedex should logically beat earnings and gap up....which is exactly why it probably won‚Äôt.   It‚Äôs all really in the guidance.

I guess saying you want to fuck your daughter doesn‚Äôt count huh? Weird.
As a binary statement, "do you want your taxes raised?" is inherently a biased question. Why don't you ask people if they want to pay for the US to murder innocent people?

Raise my taxes, I don't give a fuck. But fund programs that help citizens instead of funding subsidies for horseshit agriculture practices and US imperialism. Maybe if American citizens saw a material return on their taxes instead of it disappearing into an endless void they wouldn't mind it so much.
Could you imagine if the protesters burned the Walmart down on themselves?

FDX up 4% today which makes up half of what they lost last week. They should be over 300 by earnings on 12/17 even if they average +2% a week for the next six weeks. For perspective Over the past six months, the weekly average is +6%. They have been shipping at holiday capicity since shutdown and the next six weeks will be even more. Yes costs will go up, but they will shatter earnings both in December and April.

Short sellers will be forced to cover. Basically investors find out Monday before the bell if this company can make personalized cancer vaccines. So expect a run up as they cover going into data.

They are posting four different abstracts at a conference called SITC and the data is under embargo.

The previous data had complete responses and partial responses in a trail group of only 8 people. Statistically this is wild either by proof it works or sheer dumb luck. Either way noone in their right mind is going to risk data being that good twice. So short sellers will cover. We saw a bit of it today , it will continue all day tomorrow and Wednesday.

Buying shares until IV cool down . Not getting fucked on options lol
Ohhh cool. Now do Joe Biden when he was VP!
If Biden wins tomorrow itl be the first time in US history that they have elected an openly pedophilic man. Such progres
Biden's national poll numbers are fantastic, the margin required of error is just too unlikely for trump to win the electoral college. State level polling is also quite excellent. Early voting is up 100% from 2016, 97 million ballots already counted. Turnout will be record numbers. High turnout is crucial for democratic victories. Democratic voters are highly energized and singularly unified - no matter what astroturfing happens online here and elsewhere.

Senate projections look extremely strong for democrats. 2018 midterm elections were a huge democratic sweep, they outperformed significantly. Why? The entire issue was trump on the ballot. The 2018 House change was the largest change of seats in decades - it was a complete destruction of republicans. In the 2 years since then had trump made ANY inroads with voters? Absolutely not, they hate him even more than they did then. The evidence leads to more likelihood of a blue sweep. Plain and simple - the EVIDENCE - not feelings - points to a massive democratic victory tomorrow. A massive victory completely destroys any chance for trump with legal shenanigans, further, we understand the results likely tomorrow night. It becomes apparent to all and his twitter becomes impotent to anyone that matters. All focus moves to the new Biden administration.

Now that the election has been understood there are the markets...

The market has been negative almost every single day for 2 weeks with worry and uncertainty. Not entirely electoral but nonetheless - there is an enormous amount of hot money waiting to get back in.

If there is a blue sweep in the election, the market is looking for a $2.2T stimulus at minimum - and the expectation is even up to $3-4T. Do you recall what happened last time we spent $3T dollars in printed funds? Stimmy checks flow to people, schools get billions of dollars, kids get a plan to go back to school, free vaccines, states get billions in funds for budgets, confidence will moon. The dollar will tank, and gold will be good - but stocks will finally get a lot of pent up fear crushed. Volatility will get destroyed - RIP all those UVXY posts i see.

Tech is still grossly overvalued, see DOW/SPX out performance today and right now in over night futures. Tech is valued already richly, bread and butter stocks, old school value will get a chance to catch up. Market action will move to COVID/stimulus talks going forward.

Long 5 /ES contracts aka $825k of SPY.
https://i.imgur.com/1XQZxqF.png

This is my analysis, and it can be wrong in a few places but still leave me with a profitable trade. Worst case would be a trump victory, though highly unlikely - if that looks like that might happen, markets will implode and I hope I can exit the position fast enough.

I don't think it's that straightforward. Biden is more stable for the economy because at least he might try to control the pandemic (it's too late to eradicate completely before the vaccine). More stability means less uncertainty and stonks go up.

One small problem: the note was taped to the door leading into my *garage* (which has my apartment number on it as well) and my actual apartment hadn't even been looked at. I cancelled their service next day. 

This was the final incident, but I had had issues with them since day one. When they came in to install the system, their technician drilled a hole in the *wrong wall*, leading me to file an insurance claim against them. Incompetent and unprofessional.

I guess you missed they basically mocked the kind of post you just made, and yours isn't even a parody. I bet that fancy car impresses women more than no car or some clunker off the used car lot. Oh, wait, women aren't into money, they like a guy that's broke. Nevermind. You talk about working for money & not being a consumerist, but getting free rides (oh sorry, full ride) isn't just welfare. Oh wait, if it's a women's scholarship fund it's fine, cause women are disadvantaged cause they are smarter and are better investors than men.  "Most guys are terrible with money," that's not sexist or prejudice.. you learned well at that college. As long as you are bullying the correct group, it's not bullying. If you bully the wrong group, time for censorship. Being educated you'd think you'd understand you can't tar a whole gender as "terrible with money," that's half the population. Next, you can explain statically how good Jewish people are with money, cause that's basically what you just did. I won't even mention that I heard women are bad drivers. Well, it's to be expected I guess since women don't want a nice car.
Not even close. I'm waiting for 3.50- 4$ to sell.
Sir this is a wendy's
I did some election DD on Florida.

https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article246891077.html

"So far, 66.2% of all registered Florida Democrats have voted, as well as 65.8% of registered Republicans and 51.5% of no-party-affiliated voters."

Not only have they already voted, but the votes are already being counted, which means there is a strong chance Florida will be called by the media before 9pm tomorrow. And because of the way the electoral college works, mango NEEDS Florida in order to win.

This weakens the "Civil unrest" index puts play a little bit. But there could still be some crazy shit happen regardless of how the map looks.

Futures are flat mostly which means volatility is in the corner. Remember we are all FD/options players and volatility is our friend. Don't be a permabull or permabear. be like liquid, adapt and make money. Hedge your positions, keep enough cash/buying power in case you need to DCA. Trend for tomorrow is unknown and that's a good thing.

Well, it's essentially binary.

The odds are probably lower than one thinks given that Biden is favored in the polls right now. But what does it matter. If Trump wins, the market is going to moon. Tesla will be at an all time high and tendies will be falling from the sky.
there is no stimulus
I made about fiddy cents trading a penny stock in rich!
Yeah I see a 52 week high of 98 so if he wins the 90 calls should print
Because they're already on Nov 3rd so they already know who's the new president. So they're just acting accordingly.
they have their own internal polling data.
there is no stimulus

SPX broke thru the resistance side of the trend line from 10/3 intraday but closed right at the line yday, therefor I think the likely scenario for tomorrow is a gap up opening over the resistance side to capture prices on the support side/renter previous channel, thus SPY $336 possible which is next resistance, also ydays daily candle was a nice bullish follow thru candle off Friday‚Äôs candle, I‚Äôm short term bullish > just holding som JD $85c weeklies right now
Upvote if tommorow will be green, downvote if tomorrow will be red, comment if tomorrow will be flat.

It's for science.

EDIT: so far it's about 50/50 at -1 so slanting towards a red day. 1 comment so maybe less than 2% in either direction.  Spy 11/6 255P it is!

EDIT2: It seems like the bulls are pulling it up to +1 so ‚â§1% green day. SPY 11/6 400C might be the better play. Stay tuned!

EDIT3: Bears coming back with a vengeance, so far -3. SPY 220P on the radar.

EDIT4: Bulls really carrying the vote back up to ¬±0 but very few comments so high volatility but could be red or green. SPY straddles now the preferred play.

EDIT5: Bears really putting the downward pressure on the economy. -3 and counting, prepare your buttholes for a circuit breaker day. SPY 200P on margin is the new cool.

EDIT6: Comment bois really bringing the salty fire, aggressively flat day inbound. Cash gang or theta gang unite.

funfact: The cars share a platform and powertrain and are built by Magna Steyr in the same plant in Graz, Austria. Most of what's hidden under the sheetmetal is the same, but almost everything that's in plain sight is completely different.

Yeah even if you don‚Äôt believe Trump you can‚Äôt deny that Chris Christie, Kellyanne conway, etc were all sick with the rona too. So trump definitely had it too

We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen in the next 5, 10, 15 years. Even in the absolute worst depressions the SP 500 will make you money through dividends. I personally recommend IVV for its higher yield over VOO and lower expense ratio over SPY.

Large catalyst like the elections or earnings for a company are opportunities for the market to make large corrections on a stocks valuation. Even if the event doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the stock or is even beneficial like positive earnings, if the stock is overvalued the catalyst will be used as a correction.

honest answer.: specialized security shutters are expensive as hell, average retail couldn't afford them. in fact in most cases, bulletproof or impact resistant glass is cheaper. ply wood is cheap and you can install it quickly without a lot of skill. specialty shutters would require a whole industry of installers ready to go at a moments notice...randomly. not a feasible business unless you are talking retrofitting the garage door style metal doors. but same issues arise.

Check this out- what if Trump wins but Republicans loose both houses. Trump, having no political ideals and very reactionary, could easily get baited to pass the democratic agenda by congress. It's probably the best outcome for democrats because Republicans couldn't say shit. Historically it's likely next pres is dem too. 12 yrs of dem policy.
