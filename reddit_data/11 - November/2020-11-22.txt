You can dominate market share and have zero, or negative, profit. Who cares? Dominating the premium market is actually a great strategy.

CreditTech isn't going away anymore than mobile payments. Sure the margins are going to go down but profits are still going to be solid.

That shit is here to stay. It's just a matter of waiting out the drop and buying this when ANT IPO is about to hit. It should get pumped sympathetically and by then it will be at a fraction of it's IPO price and a steal, at least for the initial pump of "everything is fine again!".

I have 4 children who all love Roblox. I actually  played with them tonight for the first time. They are obsessed with how their characters look, just like teens are with their Call Of Duty guys. Remember how we used to make players in NBA 98 or whatever? Well now there are limitless options and for $1 your kid can get the random kitty head puppy to be on their shoulder while they play a knockoff version of rollercoaster tycoon that was built by a player. Roblox doesn‚Äôt have to do much work besides count the money, just like I do when I get their calls.

That's also one of the reasons I like it - that it just IPO-ed and is poised to grow from now. It's an established firm that spun off from Sunpower, has great proprietary tech, has a big investment from the French oil giant Total and will benefit from the growth in solar as there's a global push for cleantech. It hasn't run up like crazy like some of the other solar plays. 

Basically I see the most upside in Maxeon of all the solar plays that I've looked at. But then, like every investment decision there's always the risk of downside from Maxeon underperforming the sector or other macro factors.

As for the international market, we will meet soon."

The market has got people fucky. Someone was actually trying to argue that new lockdowns for NV isn‚Äôt bad for casinos.

LU is ticker to watch for next year. Basically similar business to ANT, chinese fintech/credittech play. ANT IPO getting torpedoed and fintech regs landing just days after their IPO is crushing their share price and short interest is like ~35%.

When it bottoms out this could be the play of next year.

How did you teach yourself and what kind of weekly stuff did you do? (options?)
Gotta be some sort of group-rate discount at that point, though.  Or you gotta factor in some CAC (advertising?) to bring the niche market custmers that want such a service.
I know right.   Played it on Friday and made a bit.  Totally fuckibf up this trade
The play wouldn‚Äôt be to delist. It would be to require Chinese companies to comply to standards that the US has been turning a blind eye to for decades. Dems have spearheaded these regs, but the Chinese economy has grown to the point that no one in US government is willing to hold them accountable to these standards anymore. If Cheeto requires transparency with basic human rights guidelines, the dems would never be able to undo them without looking like monsters. They go against the foundation of our country‚Äôs ethos. China is incapable of compliance and it would force Americans to divest.
What? No, the underlying price doesn't have to come even close to the strike price for fat gains.

You could be right that the market may have this priced in. It‚Äôs also possible that the attempt to price it in hasn‚Äôt accounted for how severe the effects could be if Chinese companies get hit with regs that are impossible to comply with.

You'll spend enough time mourning them. You don't have to do it all at once. Try to get out and have some fun to take your mind off it as best you can. Eventually the loss feels less acute and you learn to live with it.

I mean the guy is giving you a free map to discounts. They hand then out all the time, and people gripe that their stocks got banged around, only to shut up next week when they're up 5-10%. Do you think this one guy can drop a company??

Doesn‚Äôt make sense
11600 is nq BFF though
I think another factor is emotion. People see 10% drop and freak out thinking the world is going to end. That‚Äôs when you go in and be aggressive and buy up index funds. Even in the worst absolute year you‚Äôre still most likely getting your dividends. IVV is very close to 2% which I automatically reinvest.
Buy calls and find out.

This just means it'll pump before then.  Why wouldn't you pump the stock before you can sell it?  Seems logical.

wont go down too much. that being said, it‚Äôll still be enough for a call to expire worthless if the timing is off
I was actually making money and was positive this year after finally refining my trading strategy.

Then I learned about options in WSB and saw people making crazy money overnight. I tried it and lost all my profits for the year. 

Now it's literally just a gamble for me. I stopped caring about my technicals and throw in money for options when I feel like it

In the short term, they will benefit from a vaccine and airline industry recovering. In the longer term, their Aviation, Healthcare, and Power segments are consistent revenue generators and they are reducing costs to increase profitability. Their renewable energy segment is a world leader in Wind turbines, and that is looking like a growth opportunity with Biden as president and the push for clean energy. Overall, free cashflow has bottomed and will only go up from here, and that‚Äôs all that matters with a company like this.

One difference with the PLTR lockout is many employees have already been given opportunities to sell off their shares to EquityZen if they were just trying to gain liquidity.  Some people are going to sell for a bonus or whatever, but any mass sale could be self-limiting if the stock price starts moving downward.  If you're an employee who believes in the company, you're probably going to hold on to a decent chunk until retirement.  It all depends on how many people are hurting for cash and how short sighted they are.  Why sell now if you think the shares will be worth 2-3x as much when you retire?   Anyway....  I agree you should probably just flip a coin and then do the opposite.  All in on short term calls here
Huge gains huh?

Post your positions you greedy fuck
Rolled up norm in options with spreads
Yes. so if you have positions with gains and losses, you can sell your losses & gains and just retake the same position and it may be beneficial for taxation. There are all sorts of ways to manipulate your actual income.

The two biggest mistakes investors make is they don't dump their losers soon enough and they don't hang on to their winners long enough.  Especially with something like QQQ where its never going to top out permanently.  Rebalancing is what helps you buy low and sell high.

Luminar is less commercials and actually cheaper, I never kind a did a DD on luminar, but their product is cheaper and has more types/models tha Lidar! But lidar has baidu/ford and some other fancy names! Lidar suppose to he future, so its grate investing type!
Lidar good buying price is 14-16 (not above)
Ghmi is still a spac, and after lidar fiasco merger no1 is touching, so its good opportunity really! 
U can play this 2 ways, buy 1000warrants (2$) price, forget about them and excerise them when they recall them! Both of the are more investing type and definitely future! There js speculation that tesla will try Lidar and if that happens that will be 69$ stock! 
Luminar is GhMI! If you really wanna play it buy warrants and leave them and come back 1y and they will make you money! I still believe in VLDR but that stock is just pure dogshiet atm! GL 
Also there is one more cheap penny stock lidar retailer equipment company microvision its 2$! So basically there is always a chance two above go below 10, but I really dont think so! Really, if you have questions or anything DM me! Also ppl over dont know shiet about SPACs, their sec filling can burn you a lot! Hyln/vldr didnt have pipe investors lock, so all those MF unloaded millions and millions of share after merge and killed the sp! Also dont use webull for spac merger, they need 3 days to enable new ticker! Really, if u have some questions just DM me
Since PLTR was a Trump Administration investment to store COVID-19 case numbers in a software created by PLTR and TeleTracking, does that mean PLTR will plunge if Biden takes office?

It‚Äôs possible I accidentally bought calls...because ya that‚Äôs what I thought too. Because I‚Äôm now short -400 stock of nclh. I guess I‚Äôll just have to buy them at market when it opens and hope nclh doesn‚Äôt spike too much.
How much does it cost?
The bull run already happened. Be careful about yhis one look at it‚Äôs financials it was going out of business a year ago trading at $6 a share when the ceo was talking about chem trails or some shit. This is a dying star boys

Problem is you need SOME knowledge about the market. So I can't send the memes to friends. Also I have no friends.

Did people read that Lifecycle Investing book? They did all the backtesting and showed that using leverage when you are younger produces better returns and is safer than buy and hold - basically for the reason you suggest. The problem with investing is the vast majority of exposure happens in the last decade. Their idea is to use leverage when you are young to even out exposure to stocks over time. 

They basically proved mathematically that WSB approach is the safe, responsible way to invest for retirement. This is only a slight exaggeration.
I agree BABA is undervalued at $300. I agree fear selling has affected the price. I agree fundamentals point to a company that could grow at an exponential rate. 

My concern is how the market is going to react to what is likely to happen in the next two months. China‚Äôs system cannot support a celebrity billionaire. It will never happen unless he‚Äôs a puppet of the state. So, say he‚Äôs a puppet. Cheeto can institute regs that require transparency that China will never, ever agree to. Dems, starting w Clinton, have been trying to get China to agree to points as simple as human rights. If Cheeto‚Äôs boy Corey requires disclosures, dems will never be able to overturn them. It will be catastrophic for US investment in China amd Chinese companies.
You too then can be part of that low triple digit daily volume.

No smarty pants, they basically stop warning you after you disable it. So essentially, you can fat brain yourself into 4 day trades and get your account restricted.

No no no. That is not the case. If you withdraw before the withdrawal deadline of a school, that is known as ‚Äúnon punitive.‚Äù If you withdraw after the deadline, it is punitive. Often, when you withdraw before a deadline, the class is removed from your transcript. Few schools actually put W‚Äôs here, but some do. 

There are other rare forms of non-punitive (perhaps a medical exemption, but even then, people get absolutely ass blasted by being forced to taking semesters off, getting all W‚Äôs, and having an absolute dog shit LSAC GPA). It‚Äôs actually super tragic. You normally write an addendum in that case, but it rarely matters.
The only thing he could do that would reasonably affect BABA at this point is forced delisting which there is no way the SEC is going to do, the backlash would be insane.

Trade war of 2018 couldn't keep BABA down and China economy is much more self-sufficient than people realise. I don't expect anything orange man can do as lame duck with senate on recess that would actually have material effect.

Yup, bouncing into distressed debt trading myself right now. Law can be great, but it‚Äôs not for me. Was a great education in international investment and restructuring processes though, which are very valuable for the funds I‚Äôm interested in.

It‚Äôs sad how much it‚Äôs devolved into T14 or bust. But, if you know what region you want to practice in, a state school is better than Harvard. See e.g., (if I may trigger you with a blue book joke) University of South Carolina alumni v. Harvard alumni (USC alumni run the best firms in SC, not Harvard alumni).

Cohen may take over before EOY. His legal team starting that massive PR blitz this weekend is an indication of something to come. Possibly taking over after Q3 ER would be ideal timing for many reasons. If that happens, $30 is going to look like a good entry point and not a price target üòéüòé

That business model is certainly intriguing. But if the games they produce are not that fun and most people don't play it once they get old enough (unlike Minecraft) then I'm not sure how good it will be. Unless there's going to be some kind of awesome upgrade to that platform where graphics and utility is greatly enhanced.

Things have unfortunately changed drastically. GPA x LSAT is everything. I mean, sure, if you‚Äôre fine with a top 25 school, a 3.5 is fine. But, if you want to do premier, cutting-edge work in NYC (working at a V10), you‚Äôll need a T14 (more often a T6), and they‚Äôre absolute bitches to get into right now.

TBH I am not sure. But if you're into battery tech, the thing people are talking about is this new "blade battery" they released.

The reviews I've seen generally say it is safer and cheaper than other batteries. If you figure out the truth from fiction please report back ha ha.

Because developers would all be vehemently opposed to this. Reselling digital copies hurts all of the game developers and publishes.

Were you not there 2 weeks ago when everyone was talking about NIO and wtf am I doing in the weekend discussion.
Yes
Yeah. The only really important variable is the production timeline. If approval comes a month later there will be a month more vaccine ready to go when it's approved. Distribution won't be without hiccups, but it won't be the bottleneck, and they won't struggle to find people who want the jab, both at first and after millions of people have shown it to be safe.

And then: 12 million Americans have tested positive. Vaccinate them last, they're probably immune. Run more antibody tests too -- some scientists are saying that 3-10x as many people have had the virus as have tested positive, which is ballpark 10-30% of all Americans. We need to get to 60% immune before the spread is no longer self-sustaining (old numbers, who knows how accurate).

Seems optimistic to me.

Twitter's problem is that 7% of it's users create 99% of its content. It's click through rating on ads is about 1% at best (compared to 5%+ on facebook instagram) and as I said above, has the added feature of accidentally losing your job for something you wrote 10 year ago.  Parlor if done in a half way decent matter is going to be like Facebook when MySpace started falling apart. Everyone was already looking for an exit and something better finally came along.

I see this sentiment on Blind all the time and it's completely delusional. Taking a tech hub like Seattle as an example, the average salary there is around 80k. So if people can survive on 80k, then you're doing something wrong if you can't save money earning 150k.

Definitely does sound similar. And I cared a lot about my ex (still do). Which makes sense, that‚Äôll happen when you‚Äôre with a girl you‚Äôve loved for three years and that has been a huge part of your life.

Taking it seriously for the first year and put in 30k so far. I was at 42k at one point but after a series of bad decisions later, I was down to 2k. Was thinking of giving up options but altogether but figured I'd do a yolo with the last 2k. Spent it on TSLA calls and I'm at 8k now. Seeing your post gives me hope that I can recoup my investment. Just need to change my strategy and keep at it.

The demand for data analytics and management  has changed due to the increased amounts of intelligence data being collected. The US government was way behind in harnessing the full potential, often doing analyses disjointed, but now that they realize it, Palantir was perfectly positioned for defense contracts.

I did that when I was younger. I wanted the wife to stay home to raise the kids, so I worked full time m-f 8-5 as a mechanic, and worked 3rd shift m-f delivering the Wall St. Journal. On weekends I drove for Domino's. I also drove a sweeper truck 3rd shift for awhile, and later drove for a courier service 3rd shift while I still had a full time 8-5 job.

Made OK money for a kid with no college degree, but it caught up with me. I blew out a disc in my back when I was 26, and that put and end to that. I ended up going to the local community college for a year taking computer programming classes, and I've been doing that ever since. Now I'm pulling in a nice salary and get to work from home. And my back doesn't kill me when I get off work.


tl;dr: Go for the extra work if you can handle it for a bit, but be working on plan B. You don't want to be working like that your whole life. It's never too late to start something new.

**Steven Eisman** ([/Ààa…™sm…ôn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); born July 8, 1962) is an American businessman and investor known for having [shorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorting) [collateralized debt obligations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation) (CDOs), thereby profiting from the collapse of the US housing bubble in 2007‚Äì2008.

Californian here. Worth it.
I'll probably write a longer post soon. I started trading seriously in 2014. Here is a quick breakdown.

* 2014:  +9K   (started with 150K capital, just stonks)
* 2015:  -23K  (still short-term trading stonks; mostly earnings plays)
* 2016:  -91K  (Options baby!! Just money, $ROPE never even entered my mind)
* 2017:  +18K
* 2018:  -63K  (Fuck, have I learned nothing!?!)
* 2019:  -15K
* 2020:  +326K currently and cash ganged last Friday. 

The biggest thing of this year is Covid growth stonks. I did lot of January calls. But also got lucky with weeklies and monthlies of TWLO, SQ, and my biggest winner ROKU. I kept the faith, cause what the hell else was I gonna do. Easy to get gun shy after big losses, but I'm a gambler at heart. The best thing is that I'm 100% remote work because of Covid, so I can trade hard and monitor. Then do gay day job work after hours as need be. Good luck, 50K isn't much a hole to dig out.

So be a bear only during the day.  There are studies that show that most of the gains occur at night.

All in.
No one here says that the US hasn't created or armed any of the terrorist groups in the ME. Don't think that's part of the discussion.

And no, you are wrong. Some guy (let's call him Bob) in Pakistan DOES want revenge on the US for the drone killings that killed, I don't know, his wife, whilst it was meant to only kill the assistant to the regional manager of Al Qaeda next door.

Quite tragically, Obama and the military chiefs made the assessment that this is an acceptable price to pay as far as American national security goes. Bob in Pakistan is very unlikely to be the same kind of threat to American lives, as the assistant to the regional manager of Al Qaeda was. Terrorist leaders are highly specialized professionals, with a very specific set of skills that only a few hundred people in the world have. They are extremely hard to replace, and the liberal idea that "Oh, if we drone one, another angry kid will replace him" is fundamentally flawed.

It's an undeclared war, and this is unfortunately what happens.

As for the Kurds, American incompetence in foreign affairs is legendary. But I don't think this is not the same thing as what the OP is talking about.

Thanks man. I just need a side gig right now. I already work 12 hours a day Sat and Sunday, but only work 9-5 Monday-Friday. I can easily double up Mon-Fri. I'm young so I think I can swing it for a few months

Don't buy puts retard. Wait for it to dump (if it even does) and buy LEAP calls. 

Cruise Lines are never going to lack customers and that pent up demand predictably lets loose anytime they schedule a voyage. This is only a CDC warning not to go; it's not a prohibition. Most people that go on cruises are not going to care about what the CDC says as long as the voyage is still on.

The option and stock trading is a zero sum game. The winners will pay a lot of short term tax. So overall it is a losing game. On top of that, the market makers and high speed trading firms make money from retail traders. 

For everyone who shows a $100k gain, another 10 lost big time. 

For every 10 of those made big gains, 9 of them eventually lose them all.
Doesn't it have those weird places that charge $25 for $0.50 of popcorn, has stinky rooms with a screen just slightly larger than my TV, and that you have to pay like the price of a PLTR share to get in?

No one knows anything. But, yes, splits/inclusion aren‚Äôt all they‚Äôre cracked up to be. Just like an IPO. Will it be @ 600 soon? Perhaps, yet already incredibly overvalued & any big boy firms interested will know that & short sell or want a better price when it does & short sell. Volume will tell the story. So far, it tells a long story. Big volume on up days. ; small volume on down. If it persists, so be it. But everyone‚Äôs hope does not a reality make. GL, M8!

Undoubtedly. There is something known as LSAC GPA. Look it up and read on it. It is very arbitrary, and even if your school allows for you to retake the class to replace the W, LSAC GPA will still calculate the W as an F. It will add the new A, too, though.

Happy to help. If you‚Äôre interested in law school, the only thing that matters is GPA & LSAT unless you cure cancer or win an Olympic medal. 

GPA matters. Sweat it. Then sweat the LSAT. Then you can go absolutely anywhere you want and get absolutely any job in the legal industry you want. It is truly that easy. Literally, sorry for the brag, everything just fell into my lap after getting a good LSAT with an okay GPA.

You‚Äôll make $220k minimum out of law school if you go to a T6. It is literally all but guaranteed.

I used palantirs software in the military as an intelligence analyst. It‚Äôs been almost 10 years, but at least at the time their software was leaps and bounds above the other stuff we had.

Margins for originating loans are razor thin right now with rates as low as they are. Also, with Biden victory probably another round of Dodd Frank regulations and CFPB is going to get their power back which will further hinder the mortgage business.

Do you mean ps5 consoles I assume? Sony has a 110 million playstation install base and takes a 30% cut on all playstation games sold and a 60% profit margin on in house games. The success of the ps5 is already apparent and represents a 5-7 year extension of the playstation model. Sony will make something like 30-35 billion in profits over the lifespan of the ps5. Especially with the 45 million paying playstation plus subscribers which is an amazing source of recurring revenue. Also, Covid has given gaming a huge tailwind including more than a million estimated new or returned console gamers.

While it is absolutely true that sony is currently selling the ps5 at a loss (no one really knows how much per unit, somewhere between 20 dollars to 80 dollars is the consensus), those console sales will be break even as manufacturing efficiency improves and component costs cheaper. The majority of the 100+ millionPS5 consoles sold will be at a profit for sony, though probably less than a 15% profit margin net net sales.

Their market cap is only 110 billion. And of course Sony does business in a lot of other sectors as well. Long Sony.

I have no hands on/personal experience with them. They seemed to promise a lot at as a vendor/demo/reps at RSNA years ago. So I can‚Äôt say much, I‚Äôm sorry. I do know they‚Äôve been around because I know providers (OR, and some home visiting/home health/nursing home providers who‚Äôve used them for PICC line placements etc) who have all said great things about them. I just visited there website and they seem to have come a long ways. They seem to be inline with exactly what Butterfly is trying to accomplish. I personally know a guy whose son is a biomed engineer and was paid handsomely by butterfly. Based on that convo about a year ago is what made me invest. I think butterfly is Clarius on steroids in terms of R&D. I‚Äôm somewhat skeptical near term at butterfly‚Äôs ability to penetrate this market. I am concerned about declining reimbursements in general in the field. Sorry I cant provide to much substance regarding Clarius, other than it seems legit.

If Obama sat on his ass and did nothing while Gaddaffi massacred his own people to hold onto power, liberals in the West would have cried about that too. So there is really no point in talking about Libya within this particular context, except to say that right now, the real foreign players there are Russia and Turkey, not any of the Western countries. 

As for Yemen and Saudi Arabia, shitty affair. But the Saudis probably would have gone to war regardless of whether the West supported them or not. These guys were dropping billions on faraway countries like Pakistan, just to keep them away from Iran's orbit. They would have considered it an absolute necessity to go to war in Yemen, which borders them, to combat Iranian influence, with or without American approval.

All this handwringing and mea culpa about what the US and the West do wrong in X part of the world is just... self-absorbedness. A weird variant of Eurocentrism, where the white guys and gals still need to be saviors of some sort. And a weird sort of racism, where it is assumed that the local brown people have no agency or self-interest of their own.

I'm still relatively a newb but now realize you'll likely lose a fair amount just learning the market ups and downs and mechanics of trading options at all levels.  Down $13,000 over 6 months but hopefully on the upswing finally.  

Once you've lost a bunch hopefully it's been over many months of trial, error, and experience.

The way back up may take longer than initial losses but overall I feel like it's just a lesson for future plays and a lifetime of trading.

For example, nursing trains people for a career and physics is a field of serious study.  Some examples of gimmick degrees are international business, sports marketing, bioethics, business research, civic engagement, health communications, health services management, health journalism, human rights, and organizational leadership.  Anyone know of any other funny gimmick degrees?
Honestly I don‚Äôt have much, was trying to see if anyone felt differently about it. Takes a lot of research and self doubt before I pick a stock, and I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing that good honestly.

VIX and OPEX week has passed. Imagine how much work was expended to pin us to 355 at the end. Market's in a weird situation now. Flows favor bears early in the week, but VOL is still being suppressed. I wouldn't be surprised to see another vaccine or stimulus pump before market opens.

Bears have been weak the past month, so they really need to push if they want the market correction everyone's been waiting for. Holiday in the middle of the week would dampen a big bear push too. Smart play is to sell calls on the rips, but the safer play is to sell the rip, and NOT buy the dip until at least Friday.

So I know the market is rallying on vaccine news and generally has brushed off covid, but I am not confident in what happens over the next 4 months until it's able to be widely distributed. And I feel like this week is the week that shit starts to hit the fan since it's approximately 14 days since the huge spike, this week should time a death spike.

So I'm sitting at 50% cash since I increased my account by 300% already this year with the "v-shaped recovery" and TSLA calls. Anticipating some sort of pullback.

Or it could be one of those markets that goes up until the vaccine is released, and then we're like, why is it dropping, the vaccine is here.
might be at $40 by next summer

It‚Äôs trading at 15x covid-affected FFO, which is probably 7-10x 2019 FFO. Don‚Äôt look at net income, that doesn‚Äôt mean anything for REITs because you need to add back depreciation expense, which is included in GAAP net income. Hardly overvalued by FFO multiple, this is just a yolo.
I hope never!
Here's their SEC filing. No ticker assigned as far as I can tell. Looks like their numbers aren't bad.

Dominating profit =/= dominating market share. 

Market share is defined as taking the company's sales over the period and dividing it by the total sales of the industry over the same period. 

A company can be number 1 in sales yet be 3rd in profit earned. Some of you guys are more autistic than me

I got here because the memes were funny. Then thought, why not try a little bit of these option things. Then I made triple my annual salary in about two weeks. Then I lost most of it but still had enough to pay off my medical debt. All in all not a bad decision.

Edit: Too many asking me how to get into things. I had a hunch that corona was gonna really wreck shit and bought puts back in Feb. I joke about not knowing what I was doing but before I actually bought derivatives I did real research on what could happen if I was wrong. I lost it because I was literally high on the dopamine and didn't see the QE coming. Cautionary tale, not advice column.

They all know that they need private money to get approval for 18-MC, or anything else for that matter. Previous ibogaine research projects were shelved because public funding was pulled. So anything they can do to grow share price will help them secure the money for those trials, as well as securing IP from other psychedelic research like the Swiss LSD trials.

Yeah it‚Äôs easier for them to learn English than it is for us to learn Chinese. They start learning from a really young age, usually get forced to go to cram schools for extra practice, and there are a ton of resources for learning and practicing English....movies, music, tv shows, etc. 

Chinese has resources too, but the movies kind of suck, chinese music is awful, and the tv shows are melodramatic dogshit.

Same deal as 2008, nobody‚Äôs buying malls in these uncertain conditions but then mall REITs went up 400-600% in the next 2 years. Bankruptcy risk is also essentially zero, I was just giving that as an example of the worst case scenario. Almost all of these mortgages are non-recourse and secured by an individual property as opposed to the company‚Äôs assets so if the value of the collateral asset is below the outstanding balance they can just walk away from the individual property. They‚Äôre not even particularly distressed now, with 2020 Q3 FFO only down 28% from 2019 Q3 FFO.
I'm holding shares and do covered calls. 

As long as PLTR doesn't go above 21, I'll be super happy

When Joey B. Announces his Cabinet on Tuesday... a certain someone will become Unstable.
The year: 2074.

I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. That's when the joy left. That's when hope left.

I'm not a religious man, but I sometimes allow my mind to slip away into more pleasant things. I imagine holding her again. I run my fingers through her strawberry-blonde hair. I don't believe in the afterlife, but pretending makes me feel like me again, if only for one fleeting moment.

I turn on my neuralink and close my eyes. I flip through old pictures. It's her. I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.

I open a browser and check SPX futures. 

3,563

It hasn't moved in decades now. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days. When I was happy. When she was here.

Sitting alone in an empty room, I let out a weak, broken whimper: "futures flat... and gay."
I‚Äôll join
Please let this be true
I honestly think he loaded up on puts, knowing he would of lost .. apparently boomers think if a democrat get elected its automatically a limit down scenario.

This is the new normal. The volatility is in correlation to what social media has done to everyones minds. The massive trend of new traders is just like the massive trend of everything going digital. If you think we're going back to the days where we only check our phones every 3-4 hours, you're mistaken. This is legit the beginning of everyone being glued to their phones on social media/trading. Just wait until robinhood expands it platform to be more social and add their banking system that is inevitable.
I'm not expecting bearish anything this week.  All green days baby
If it's a bunch of penny stocks then yes, stay the fuck away. They just looking to offload bags on sell calls to retards.

I mean absolutely no one was talking about the insane valuations pre crisis (sarcasm). The NASDAQ should have gone lower if the fed didn't artificially inflate stock assets. You are the one looking at things with little to no context. Plus you are acting like any of that uncertainty isn't still around
Yes
Are 0.2% likely with this much liquidity?
fuck, you're right.
Damn, you strutting around the white part of town now huh?
CRSR
They still sell them shits?
I joined a discord from a guy I saw on Tik Tok. There are a couple ‚Äúeducators‚Äù in the server that post their ‚Äúplays‚Äù. Much of what they post seem to be small caps. Seems like a classic pump and dump to me? I never touched anything they posted and left the server.

Hell yeah there were a ton of opportunities to swing this over the past few months where it kept dipping back to .80. The CEO got on yahoo finance after their earnings report earlier in the week and the stock has been thooming since so I agree we should probably just let it ride from here.
Been frequenting the same liquor store for years and I'm friendly with the manager.  He holds a few nice things back for me.
As soon as vaccines start rolling out I am buying mega puts on Pfizer, Moderna, AZN. You know there is some rando just waiting to say they took the vaccine and it gave them leukemia or something else. As soon as that hits the news cycles it‚Äôs all over.

Keep your risk low. Adjust your expectations. Track that shit through the day.


Oh and for the love of god, don‚Äôt be buying weeklies on a Thursday and expect to profit‚Äî but I guess that all circles back to adjusting your expectations

Yes and yes.  It will be interesting to see if those match the actual numbers tomorrow.

Too bad we didn't have Shkreli here to weigh in. Miss that dude bro. The Feds screwed him big time. Mango should have commuted his sentence, like Blago.
It‚Äôs gonna suck when things get back to normal. This volatility has been like cocaine.
This is the way
Mind sharing what your strategy is? At these volatility levels I reckon it's immensely hard outrun theta unless you're kinda 'gambling'
Besides tech, which I already have, I think I‚Äôm gonna load up on Costco tomorrow.
Hold on honey your calls are going to voicemail all i see is green!

buy calls on defense contractors. white obama's gonna drone strike the middle east like it's motherfuggin star wars.

remember, obama is the only president to spend a full 8 years at war. trump didn't start any so defense hasn't been printing like it could've been... But now that white obama is back in office with barely the cognitive ability of a jar jar binks... At this point all he knows to do is to write his name, and by god he's gonna write his name on just about every bill the democrats get to him.

Dry ice is far cheaper and the sublimation temperature (-78C) is acceptable for the vaccine. No need for liquid nitrogen that evaporates at -196C.

Dry ice is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, so it's plentiful and cheap. Burning fossil fuels could save us with this vaccine.

You guys think we‚Äôll see a vaccine approval before the 1st of December?
Why so bullish?
I don‚Äôt understand
I‚Äôm not super bullish on BABA in the short term and here‚Äôs why: 

Nothing has changed.

Chinese and US markets clearly overreacted to the negative catalysts that sent BABA down 20% in the last month. The bounce we‚Äôre seeing now is to be expected. It‚Äôs going to take more positive catalysts and a more than 2-day rotation into tech to send it back over $300.

Bottom-line: don‚Äôt play OTM December calls expecting this run to continue. $300 or under calls expiring next February or later are safe.

I‚Äôve been fighting back the inner bear since the election. I made huge gains last week on fcel and sbe so I cashed out. SBE is about where I expected it to be at merger and I think it only is where it is ahead of merger because of the sheer retard optimism that has been powering the market and could easily slip back to $15 on a rough news cycle. I cashed out with house money. No regrets.

Options at a base level are bets against the market. If you enjoy gambling, a lot more carries over then most day traders would enjoy to admit. The market (or house), sets the bet and you have a premium (or call, buy in) based on how likely they believe that is to happen. Lower chance, higher pay off; but a higher chance you just lose the premium you paid (upwards of a few grand on naked calls)

- PFE‚Äôs vaccine EUA will be discussed on 12/11 - no guarantee that it‚Äôll be approved.

- There‚Äôs no guarantee that D&L will go smoothly.

- Production is optimistically capped at 50 mill doses and it‚Äôs a 2-dose vaccination - meaning only 25 million people will be vaccinated in 2020. The 25 million will also be globally distributed some to US, some to Canada, some to Europe, (I‚Äôm not sure how much US has procured).

- Even after distribution, studies show only 60% (optimistically) will take the vaccine.

- Even though vaccines are available, the public will fear going outside and take measures to avoid public contact.

- COVID fears ‚Äúexpected‚Äù to dissipate 3 years from now. 

- Which businesses will survive before then is unknown.

When you say ‚Äúforward looking‚Äù, we still need  to surpass many hurdles.

You need to account for 8:1 ADR split and then convert HKD to USD to get the real USD price.

i.e:
262.2 * 8 * 0.13 = 272.688

So current price is actually US AH trading price.

Sopranos is easier to watch and has more comedic relief. If you haven't watched The Godfather I & II, Goodfellas, Casino, etc. Do that first as primer. They make references to Godfather throughout the entire series.

Wire is the kind of show you start out watching with a cup of coffee in the morning so you don't miss anything until the characters get established. The second season is real slow at first but picks up- I think many people lose interest here but I really like the 2nd season. It's a fantastic show watching 3 subsets of people social warfare with each other- The cops, the drug dealers, and the dope fiends... One of those shows that's so real its a bit depressing at times though.

To be honest if you drew a regression line it is actually on track.
The year is 2021. Hundreds of thousands of bankrupt bears have taken to congregating behind the dumpster at their local Wendy's, hoping to give a lousy blowjob in exchange for cash. The number of bears have driven blowjob prices down to mere pennies and anyone with a fiver can have their jimmy waxed for days on end.

Upon hearing about the flooded Wendy's blowjob market, Supreme Emperor Jerome Powell tells his underlings to "shut down the experiment." The men nod, then travel to a remote location in the Nevada wastelands, where an HP desktop printer continues to belch out dollar after dollar. With a swift yank of the power cord, the printer is unplugged, and America's middle class begins to emerge from its slumber.

Dude Amazon retail is barely profitable. The margins are wafer thin

Yeah, if there's not enough demand, it could go down.

George Soros has already  said that he would get out of his position(he would slowly sell out after the lockup period ends). He supposedly doesn‚Äôt like the company's values just like Google, Facebook etc(then why did he invest in PLTR in the first place from the private market? and now that he will probably triple his holdings, he doesn‚Äôt like what the company stands for any more).

But remember, Ark bought most of it‚Äôs stocks at around $14 in price range. Which means it expects it expects the stock to climb to at least double within 5 years.

So, in the long run, PLTR would likely move in upward trajectory. If investors fear that early investors could sell and this would result in the stock feeling downward pressure, this could already be priced in before the sell off comes.

I'm gonna speak a little truth.

If you have more than 100k and more than about 5-10% of your portfolio is in options, you're dumb.

going all in on options make sense only when you have nothing to lose and you need 10x leverage for the gains to have any impact on your life.

If you already have 100k, 200k, etc, just fucking invest. You'll get real, substantial gains on positions that size just from owning stock, at way less risk.
They are probably going bankrupt if things stay the way they are. However, investors like Cohen might turn the company around. GME hype is due to the fact that it has over 100% of its shares short, if things start going well for them the short squeeze is going to be massive.
Yeah that is probably smart. 2/19 is the real money maker here.
you know, nothing is for sure, nothing. Investing in a dollar % appropriate for your total stake allows you to have a gain, and not get hurt if you are wrong. Not to be a fuddy-duddy, but sooner or later, when everyone says "I am all in", I hope they are kidding, but you never know. The pros take positions, and if it looks good, add to those positions if the mood looks favorable. Good luck with your decision.

I love the  MRVL idea, but it'll be 2-4% max of my funds if that. The markets, in any sector, can turn on you like a gator. I just found some notes that back in early Jan 2020 I was buying calls, MRVL was \~ $26 share. I got in, got out a few times with calls, but then the SPACs got hot and stayed away. Time to go back home.

Last few cycles it's actually been around the clock trading rather than follow pattern. What we are seeing on HK is gap up to NYSE closing price and then we will see what happens from there.

If it goes up in HK (i.e past the 3% gap up) we will likely see it gap up a commensurate amount on NYSE in pre-market trading.
If it trades sideways then NYSE will open flat at ~271, and down, well yeah, it will gap down.

Reviewing the trades you find that they bought late and sold early. They aren‚Äôt good at trading, they just benefitted from an easy fucking market and think making money makes them smart. It‚Äôs making minimizing the amount of missed money that makes you a good trader. Keep your day job and just trade alongside it.

Watch the sopranos first so you can revisit it after the wire. Sopranos is a better comfy atmosphere. Wire is an atrocity exhibition that has equal replay value, but fewer warm fuzzies like sopranos. There is no single actor as compelling as gandolfini in wire, and his presence elevates everything. Besides, despite a borderline cringe first season, sopranos finishes SO much stronger than wire.

**What's the sentiment on GME**. I honestly think the company is doom as it has competition from other retailers,  everything is going digital, and no one really buys physical copies anymore (especially with the new consoles).

Right? Same situation here.. so few succeed trading because they're unwilling to try again after the first blow-up.

Little do they realize once they push past those first shitty couple days, it gets easier and easier.

Basically they have just about figured out a way to have an electric motor without needing a transmission. AI tells it what to do. Benefits are obvious.

It's a long term play though.

I was buying and selling and shorting and covering  NIO around $11 to $16,  and I remembered Citi downgraded when NIO was at $13.

Lol they haven't lost money in years. They don't have a moat but the have a good product. Steady growth and most people are sleeping on HelloSign acquisition that can do what docusign does but docusign is valued at 7x what DBX is. Just very compelling purchase. But plenty of companies don't have a moat and grow for years because of superior products. And losing money is literally wrong so I'm kinda confused

The subscription fee for Lumify is optional as if with most ultrasound devices. It was an upfront $7000 that came with a free tablet for viewing. I can also view images on my phone.

Yes, the main downside is that there are 3 different probes but that is how a typical ultrasound machine works. You use different probes for specific types of exams. I do musculoskeletal injections so I only chose the musculoskeletal probe for better viewing. This is also a negative for Butterfly IQ which has only one probe for everything. The quality starts to suffer because Cardiac vs Abdominal vs Musculoskeletal exams are hugely different and benefit from different transducer probes.

A lot of companies that were affect by the Chinese regulatory announcements returned close to their previous trading values. BABA was probably delayed in the recovery given its the most affected, but it should follow suit. It might even hit  its previous ATH this year if nothing new comes out via the chinese regulators. Also ANT Group isn't cancelled, so investors hope it will go to IPO in the near future.

investors are probably buying the dip. BABA is one of the few undervalued companies in this market
Lmao no in CA it‚Äôs usually >250k

Sorry for my late reply. Your post got shadowed among some other comments.

PLTR is a 17 years old company(even though their products are not that old, one was in 2008, another in 2012 probably).

They have given employees lots of options, which was previously traded in secondary market, but now that they are public, they could be exercised.

A lot of employees have had accumulated lots of options in hope of IPO and so there were a lot of RSUs(which have expiration date) being exercised.

This is a non cash expense and would likely decrease very quickly. I am not worried about it really.

 IWM is only 1% off of ATH, which is hard to explain.

It rallied the most from March lows (85% versus SPY's 63%). It is also made up of the weakest companies with the most exposure to a second round of shutdowns, or a delay in stimulus.

On a shorter timeframe, it also looks to be overextended. In the past 2 weeks, IWM is up 8% versus SPY's 1.5%.

Of all the major indices, IWM looks like the most likely to crumble.

Will get some 12/11 $177p's tomorrow.

Since when is this weak-hands shit the real man move?  


When I love I go all in, just like I go all in on TSLA 500c LEAPs.
The problem is if you get this 315,000 windfall around the end of the year, then you reinvest it, yolo, and come February you're sitting on 20,000 because you went down 295,000 in January. In tax terms, you still made 315,000 last year, and you can't carry back what you lose this year. So you're screwed.

If you make $315,000, you should set aside $85,000 to pay the taxes, and consider what you want to do with your new $230,000, rather than just consider what to do with your $315,000.

Might be the most interesting post on WSB. Fed Balance Sheet has flatlined past few months as well. Bullish sentiment at AAII is also at a ST high. All indications of a market top but vaccine EUA may put a floor under market and your puts may get fucked by theta. Also the EUA and vaccine may just continue rotation into value and cyclicals like XOM, TAP, DIA, INTC and others. Lastly traditionally the market rallies after Thanksgiving through year end. I think you are a little early. My guess is that there will be setbacks with vaccine distribution in the new year and the market will tank in January after a modest holiday rally.
The media literally only references it because it's a higher price per share than other indices. They would rather say DoW jONes DrOPs 900 poInTs!!! than S&P500 drops 90 points. Bigger numbers sound more interesting to their dumb viewers.

Well think about it, people in Hong Kong are trading 9988 while the US is asleep. And people in the US is trading BABA while Hong Kong is asleep. So there's people who do arbitrage trades between US and Hong Kong until price discrepancy reverts back to 8:1.

In general I understand if DXY goes down, equities go up. what happens if it goes down too much, from a macro perspective? Would someone step in?
Well he still gets exposure to 1100 shares worth of NIO. The time value of an option this deep in the money is going to be pretty small compared to the intrinsic value. So he's basically just long on 1100 shares. If he's still bullish on NIO why not hold it as a lower risk play.

Or he can hold for a few more weeks for who knows. Maybe 32k%. I‚Äôd personally just set a stop loss GTC at like 15k% and let it ride. He said he got it early this year too. If he can hold for about 1-2 more months, he may be able to rake in a long term capital tax gain and that would prob be worth it

It does, but IWM‚Äôs holdings changed a bit so idk.

It was underperforming even before the pandemic. Now it‚Äôs hitting ATHs. Seems silly considering the best performing stocks in the Russell 2000 get moved out to larger cap indices while the worst performing large-mid caps get dropped to Russell 2000.

Literally the worst index to buy into.

If you don't think those spaces will soon get filled then you're not thinking it through. Certain specific REITS with diversified exposure and not too dependant on mega-urban poors are all going up in the next few months. Any idiot knows that. Some of these REIT's are collecting 95%+rent and have lots of cash flow. The only reason it's not meme stuff is because it may correct in near term due to covid fear before it's certain come up. If You're a 2-4 month out kindaguy tho, you will make tendies. My dd made STOR my favorite. I sold for profit after PFE spike, but will probably get back in if there is a gap fill back down a bit.
Nah just seeing through his play

 PLTR 12/18 $22c, am i fuk. Bought for 200 each.
Wrong, it's inevitably and effectively gaining exponential market share within huge relative margins. History tells us success is magnified when a product or service is created a decade before it's supplemental need. Anyone who has done at least the minimum research will see the straightforward alignment when it comes to the growth trajectory. To put this in simple terms, buy all you can retard!

If the stock is at or below the part of the spread that you sold then you would lose all your money invested. For example you could buy a 300 put and sell a 299 put. Since the difference between the two is 1 you must hold $100 as collateral. If the stock is at 299 or below at expiration you would lose you $100 collateral. I can explain further if this doesnt make sense.

Obviously the vaccine is gonna come out next year and fix this whole thing, but the important thing to consider is the timeline of vaccine release. They‚Äôre gonna release it in phases. Beginning with high risk ppl and front line health workers. The markets are already pumped up on the vaccine news. Unless the government passes another stimulus bill I think the juices will start running dry as we see COVID cases increase and stricter regulations. If that happens we‚Äôll probably see another big dip. Either way if ur smart and blessed by the wsbgods you‚Äôll make money so it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter.

I do not disagree with that analysis. Negative rates on the horizon but someday, the fed will have to answer for there printing and I doubt they can default, so that leaves raising rates. Seeing as that worked so well in 2018, I can only imagine the carnage that lies ahead. Market is so forward looking that by Q3/Q4 we will be back to normal. Yet it can‚Äôt look 2-3 more quarters out when shit is likely to hit the fan. Then again. Maybe we can pussy pound the dollar into the oblivion and just delete the debt and start over with no repercussions. Either way shall be exciting to watch and trade while it unfolds.

Lower tax rate reduces interest tax shield from borrowing, making it generally less attractive to borrow. Your Kd is higher as a result.

lower tax rate should improve after-tax cash flow for many businesses, which would increase valuation directly, or investors would see cash flows less risky and reduce equity cost of capital. Generally lower taxes attracts more equity capital.

That's why you don't brag everybody you know IRL. Unless you are sitting on REALized gains.
I can‚Äôt argue against most of claims, as I don‚Äôt know or I agree, but it seems unwise to think we haven‚Äôt recreated or rearmed terror groups in the region.

The groups in Turkey who are facing a genocide may not be a fan of us; and some of them have the same back round that Hassad did. This includes US and other western high op training, as they served as boots for many missions before we pulled out under trump. 

Obama isn‚Äôt clean either; it‚Äôs a little Hollywood supervillain, but someone could want revenge for the number of innocent killed in drone bombing 

And lastly; Oil. If you haven‚Äôt before now, look at the 1st world collection of resources. How many do it for limited things on land they know they control? Why would you want to do it for a limited resource, when you can sit back till there‚Äôs less? We are on a stock thread so Op cost it, honestly.

China is a monster. Only 3% of China was middle class in 2000. Now it is just over 50% today (707M). China has experienced the fastest wealth growth in history in just two decades. If they keep up this pace, your average chinese citizen will be making just as much as your average american.

I've made small gains throughout this year via options trading mainly in March (where even a monkey could have made money). 

For sake of math, I rounded.. I put in about 1k and have about 4k total (3k in gains). I understand that the 3k is taxed as income, but if I buy 3k in options and lose it all, I would owe nothing?

I would rather yolo 3k in meme options than give 900 to the IRS, so this is good info to know.
So it's that time of night where green futures normally arent good for bulls, and if were up from the vaccine news then .3% is a little pathetic.

ROBLOX's problem is that their userbase is 11 year olds, and it's hard to monetize that audience because they have no money.

Maybe people will finally realize drug approval takes years because months pass between submission and decision. Repeat several times through the three trials. FDA fucking suck. They fucked up the test approvals in spring too.
This is not the way
Look, Palantir is used by the IC for data mining massive amounts of intel data. It combs through disparate databases and finds relationships. It is used by analysts as a tool to find trends, unseen relationships, and aggregate differing types of intel. It can help build target folders, but it doesn't have anything to do with go/nogo decisions. It is not Minority Report predictive IA.

Palantir's market within the military and three letter agencies is pretty much saturated. It will continue to grow incrementally, but not geometrically. Some growth will happen in downstream law enforcement. The big growth will be foreign governments (inasmuch as trade restrictions on military technology allow) and big businesses needing big data mining.

That's all I'm going to say about my firsthand knowledge of Palantir.

I am overweight long PLTR, but I'm not retarded.

If the price is too low I think you're at risk for being delisted from the exchange, so it has to be at least a dollar iirc, maybe more. It can drop below that for a while but not too long. If it's too expensive then there could be liquidity problems. Not enough people buying and selling shares leads to large gaps in the bid ask spread. But some companies like berkshire don't give a shit.

Depends if Russia has a target price they want to try to keep. They might escalate again, very possible they want to keep shale oil shutdown. Which starts to make sense at about 60/bbl.

I don't really know to what end game but it certainly was impeccably timed and extremely effective.

June-July Gay Bear here.
Ya, same. I was a bit more conservative than you. I bought 100 shares and sold a $500 strike call for June. Breakeven is $387 (I'm pretty sure TSLA wont go below that given prior support levels). Max gain is like $11k so nothing crazy but I'm more comfortable putting that much $ to work. Funded most of it with 0% margin.

Growth investors are more interested in companies with strong leadership, innovative products, etc that "aren't profitable" because they might become profitable in the future. PLTR spends a ton on stock comp for top tech talent because they are working on Rehoboam from westworld.    


"It's not profitable yet" is not a reason not to invest.

Uh, have you seen Tesla's valuation lately?

All they have to do is create a little trouble for Tesla, publicize it. 

Then make it clear that NIO is the chosen one for EV manufacturing in China, and publicize it. 

NIO will pick up every penny of market cap that Tesla drops. 

They will have all the cash they need to do anything they want. And with the manufacturing knowledge and capacity within China, they can ramp up production much faster than Tesla ever could. Not to mention corporate spying and everything, they probably already know everything there is to know about how Tesla does things.

Short sellers tend to do this with publicly available information, it's just really hard to discover, so it's not considered insider trading.

It's not too hard to get a good dev job here (in the bay) and work up to 200k total comp.

Keep in mind 200k here is not what it is in other places. I make over that amount as an engineer, taxes here are high, so take home is like 130k, rent is high, so if you don't wanna live with a bunch of roommates that's another 30k a year even for a not so nice studio. Everything else is expensive here too, to the point that if you're starting a family most people leave and go somewhere else even if they are both making these kinds of salaries (childcare is ridiculously expensive). Still a great salary though, you can pretty easily live comfortably and save 70-80k a year if no kids.

Your average engineer at FAANG is L4 and makes about 250k total comp, about 40% of which is stock. Above average 330k ish (L5), but this is a much smaller group of highly skilled engineers. This is still only about 180k post tax cause screw california.

By "top engineer" I mean like, the top 2-3% of FAANG engineers who are all geniuses, L6+, those guys make 500k+ total comp.

Yeah in a sense. Tencent video has sports, foreign shows/documentaries so they're more diverse, but thats because they have the captial to spend a lot more for licensed entertainment. IQiyi is known for producing their own original content like Netflix, which is why subscriptions to both IQ and Tencent video are required if you want to keep up with youth culture. Also just to note, none of the Chinese streamers are profitable. Tencent doesn't even reveal their tencent video financials because it's probably ugly, they only reveal their subscribers (120M).

Afterwards, I ripped out the tongues of those DD posters who‚Äôs mouths had blasphemed against NIO, my master, and then slaughtered them. Any Bears found still alive were flogged in front of the Winged Bulls built by Sennacherib, my Grandfather. I whipped them on Sennacherib‚Äôs tomb, and then tossed their quivering flesh for the jackals, the birds, and the fish to eat. In this way, I placated the wrath of the gods who had become incensed by their ignominious deeds.*

Impaired trash.
Why?
My thought was more around continuing to use the profits in the market because I either make more money with it (preferred) or if it's lost then its not going to be taxed. Basically just focusing on net profit losses instead of doing it for each trade as the OP seems to suggest. This gets more complex with quarterly estimated payments, etc, but I get where you're coming from.

Thanks for the clarification.

Once again you fuckn chucklehead the manufacturing of green energy is irrelevant to the physical charging station. They draw energy from the grid. It doesn‚Äôt matter who makes it. This is not a difficult concept to grasp. 

Most of those gas stations you think represent the existing real estate that they could capitalize on are owned by franchisees who lease a name and sign a contract to purchase fuel. 

Even if they were completely owned by the oil company it would still be irrelevant because the cost of installing and maintaining charging stations is incredibly low. Why in gods name would you pull into a gas station to fuel up and sit there and wait when chargers will be available at Walmart where you were going to spend 30 minutes anyway?  Even a tesla supercharger takes an hour and a half to get a full charge. If we improve that by 90% we are still talking about a 15 minute or so charge time. 

Gas stations make money on volume. Volume that you can‚Äôt reproduce if it takes 15 minutes per vehicle instead of 2 minutes. And that is talking about a near perfect case scenario where charging speed is improved 90% before large scale EV adoption. 

Again, you clearly haven‚Äôt put much thought into this but I commend you for sticking to your guns and dying on this stupid stupid hill.

This is not insider trading. Insider trading is taking specifically non-public information and using it to profit. How "non-public" is defined is specifically information that is not at all released to the public; if you were a journalist you would have to have access to public records to discover these items.

TL;DR: Research is not considered Proprietary Information.

Well that's awesome! did you post DD? NIO 11/27 50(p?)... analysts ratings are above $50 for NIO now... its gonna need some negative catalysts and with their new market value they can demonstrate some expansion moves in their guidance... up up up
We going for qqq 420
You‚Äôre right about the net gain/ loss is taxed but if you continuously take losses to eliminate tax you won‚Äôt pay tax and you won‚Äôt have any income. Your 1099 or w2 will be meager and no bank will give you a loan. I do suppose that is all out of context however. 

You‚Äôre right, net gain/loss at year end is the taxable amount. Just seems silly to keep losing money
Wait, you guys bought calls Friday at close right?

Paper trading is inaccurate because...

1. No emotions you have to deal with in paper trading.

2. No market manipulation you have to deal with either.

You made the right choice.

Okay. So I laid out why big oil has literally nothing to offer in EV charging beyond the cash to start building a business - which literally thousands of other companies also have.

So tell me fella. Since I‚Äôm so dumb and you‚Äôre so smart. What makes Exxon any more likely than Costco or Pfizer to be able to launch a successful competitor to chargepoint or blink? 

You spent 3 seconds thinking ‚Äúwell cars run on oil now so oil companies should compete here.‚Äù And thought no further beyond that point either because you‚Äôre incapable or lazy.

I‚Äôm not saying gas stations are dead tomorrow. They‚Äôve got at least 2 decades of life left in them as a business but we will see numbers dwindled as EVs replace ICE vehicles over the next 2 decades.

If Cali stops ICE sales in 2030 we can imagine by 2025 there will be a significant reduction in ICE vehicle sales as most with the money to buy new is going to be shopping outdated tech.

As the number of ICE vehicles on the road dwindle they number of fueling stations will gradually reduce as well. 20 years from now the only ‚Äúgas stations‚Äù that are still in business will be the ones that were able to survive as local convenience stores. 

In 1990 did you think that by 2010 your computer, home phone, camera, alarm clock, radio, vhs tapes, CDs, and countless other instruments and devices not to mention all of the information available to the whole of mankind would be replaced by a device smaller than your TV remote that you carried around in your pocket?

Apparently op gave a shit about market share.
Yea but is that really worth the risk? I understand anything is better than nothing. But if you're trying to be risky and double your 20$ in even the next year, you're going to have to buy either very risky penny stocks or far OTM options very close to expiration. Either of those options have a very high liklihood that you will lose most if not all of that 20$.


If you truly are in a very tight money situation like you say, I assume you would rather keep that money safe instead of basically betting it away. Not to say investing is not a good way to grow your money, I think everyone should invest in the market once they are financially able to. But it's honestly just not really worth it in your situation in my opinion, holding an index fund or safe stock for a year just to maybe make 2 more dollars while opening yourself up to the risk of losing money isn't a good plan.

Not to be rude but investing isn‚Äôt really for you at this point. It‚Äôs more than likely that you will just lose your money and even if you do make a small profit, you‚Äôll likely lose it all on your next play. Take this time to study the market, work on paper trading (trading with fake money) and see how you would have performed had it been real money. Once you have some more savings and feel confident put in a sum of money that you are prepared to lose and try it out. There‚Äôs no easy path to wealth and even if there was it most certainly would not be in this sub. WSB is not for you

The argument you made was that oil companies would move in on charging companies right? 

Having real estate and being in renewables has nothing to do with chargepoint‚Äôs business model.

What good is having vertical integration in a completely unrelated business have anything to do with EV charging stations? 

Literally whataburger has as much moat in EV charging as Exxon. 

Oil companies aren‚Äôt doomed immediately. Gas stations won‚Äôt go out of business in 2021. But oil companies have absolutely shit all nothing to do with EV charging stations and have no obvious entrance.

Apis bull god

On feast days and festivals the bull was turned loose in a special chamber with different gates leading from it. Symbols and foodstuffs were placed on the other side of the chamber's gates, and people would ask questions regarding the future while the bull was led into the room. Whichever gate the bull chose to go through would provide an answer to the people's questions.

This sounds like our method for predicting market direction.

If someone lacks discipline and doesn't trust that they'll YOLO their 2020 wins in 2021; then yes the recommendation would be to pay off the estimated taxes immediately.

They can't fall much more. Support has been at the low fives for a while.
I bought ZM in part because it's become obvious over time that they just have a flat out better product than the other VC options I have tried. Some percentage of people are going to stay virtual in the long run now and ZM is what they are going to gravitate to. That's more of a long-term factor though, not likely to help with your call this week I know.

Is this the same K12 that was knocking on $50 pre-Labor Day only to collapse once schools started session in September?  I think that the market realized that $LRN's largest addressable market was local US school districts that have zero dollars for technology investment and can't find their ass with both hands when it comes to strategic planning.  Teachers across the US have had a soul-crushing experience so far this school year and will be unfairly blamed for the pandemic results going forward.  I'm not saying K12  doesn't have good products, but their targeted customer is a moron with no money.

Think about it. You have 500k regular viewers. Lets be conservative and say collectively they are worth $5m in volume. You can build a position in just about any asset and then report about how great their short term financial outlook is... hell maybe even keep it to yourself until retail investors figure it out themselves and the price begins to move, then you report and sell your own news. It can work in reverse too.

Damn. That is dumb as shit. What kinda half wot boomer mathematics did you use to come to that conclusion?

What exactly do you think those big oil companies are going to do to move in on charging infrastructure?

Energy generated for charging points can come from the grid or possibly later down the line localized solar panel installations. Big oil has nothing to do with that.

Those gas stations you use with big oil brand names are franchises. If you think that Exxon is going to move in on chargepoint because they have existing infrastructure you‚Äôre fuckn retarded. IF that scenario were to come to fruition they would basically be a convenience store franchise that would still be purchasing charging stations from companies like chargepoint (get ready to have your mind blown, oil companies don‚Äôt actually manufacture the pumps). 

Also why would anyone try jamming their cars into a fueling station to charge when charge stations can be installed anywhere. At work, Walmart parking spaces etc. Fueling stations won‚Äôt exist when ice die. 

Big oil has no foot in the door on charging stations. They don‚Äôt have any kind of infrastructure that will give them a leg up if they do decide to get involved in charging. If they want to stay in the energy business then they could switch focus from oil to renewables as some are doing but that still leaves them entirely irrelevant to EV charging as it doesn‚Äôt matter who manufactures the energy the chargers pull off the grid.

Look at charts in dem vs republican presidents.  Dem prez is typically more bullish than a republican candidate.

National debt had been parabolic since Trump took office despite tax cuts and this is before Corona relief ever took effect.  

Whether a dem or repub won this time would be negatively effected by exhausted Covid 19 economic resilience.  Industries (service, travel etc) can only last so long on fumes.   We're going to need a massive stimulus with a highly effective vaccine and immediate preventative measures to tamp the current parabolic numbers down.

With that said... Still thinking a bull market.  Stimulus will come, and then we'll be back to a new normal within a year.

Wow you have figured out the market! I'm sure no one has thought of it before 

Literally just Google why it is not a good idea to buy puts before dividend payout date.
Basically, you get a loan that is Too Big To Fail. Once DB gives you $300m, they kind of have to give you another $200m to keep you afloat so you can pay back the first $300m. Then they have to give you $150m to keep you afloat for that other $200m. Then you have a bunch of nerds working risk in the basement warning the partners on the 60th floor, but fuck those nerds what do they know and then he needs another $100m and so on.

Why couldn't Roblox IPO before March this year. That stock would have gone straight up while the market drilled.
I'm going all cash sometime in December. But in reality, the answer is no because Republicans are going to win the two Georgia runoff elections for Senate, so Biden will not get to pass anything for at least 2 years.

They will benefit from a vaccine and airline industry recovering. On top of that their Healthcare and Power segments are consistent money makers and they are reducing costs to increase profitability. Their renewable energy segment is a world leader in Wind turbines, and that is looking like a growth opportunity with Biden as president. Overall, free cashflow has bottomed and will only go up from here.

Yes in a way. You have a yearly limit of 500 trades per year, after that what you're basically doing is laundering money by "Washing" your money through various trades. The more trades you do past the 500 limit the harder it is to exactly identify everything happening. It's a huge federal deal

I might have misunderstood what he meant, but you can buy stocks in form of the IPO, so it is not on the market before you already got it for a fixed price, which everyone, including you, already knows. But then what I thought he meant was that he was waiting until it was on the market before buying and if the stock is so undervalued as he proclaims, then you can lose a lot of gains.

Tldr; PLTR 800c 12/21
Thought it said Palantirians. Disappointed

that's a gray area but it can be considered legal if you see it as doing research on your investment and if the company is doing something fishy you release that info as due diligence or as a public service.

The question is whether you should be bearish on stocks that are way past ATH with the economy in the shitter.

Oh lawd, not the gun owners with their tactical pen knives and CoD night-vision goggles. The Libtards don't stand a chance.

Been hunting to put food on my table since I was 7, bow and rifle.

Millions of people turn down a flu vaccination, and that's why it spread unchecked and killed 61,000 people in 2018. By refusing to vaccinate you endanger not yourself, but everyone around you. It's about as responsible as taking that gun of yours and firing a few rounds through the front door next time someone knocks, just to open it up and find your uncle bleeding out on the other side.

Don't worry though, guns keep you safe. Definitely won't be another sociopathic retard that shoots you in the back in the event people really do start acting like animals.

I honestly don‚Äôt see how shorting PTON after upcoming earnings isn‚Äôt free money. They‚Äôll blow earnings out of the water because of New Year‚Äôs resolution sales/lockdowns. The stock will go through the roof and IV will come down. At this point buy a long dated put, maybe Sept, 2021. As it gets warmer, sales go down, as COVID lockdowns ease up sales go down. At this point people will be selling them on Craigslist for cheaper than on the website.

EU also rely on US tech companies fines for money.
The fact that you can hire someone for $100 (even less, considering that there are no monetary transactions being made on the website) to build a fully functional website and that this company was not able to do this should be very concerning for any investor.

I work on sourcing hotels for people to stay at in my company. They don‚Äôt ever have rental cars so being able to safely walk to food is a huge thing. 

It‚Äôs a fucking nightmare. The whole goddamn country was built for us to shuttle our WALL-E fatasses around in cars. Especially in the north, with any snowfall you can‚Äôt even walk along the grass where there‚Äôs no sidewalk because snow banks get built up. Half the places I go there‚Äôs a great sidewalk that just fucking disappears half a mile down the road at some intersection with no crosswalk, leaving you to frogger across some four lane road while cletus in his jacked up f350 throws a mostly eaten Big Mac at you before rolling coal and taking 2 months of your lungs‚Äô useful life. I tried to go for a run last week and ended up rolling both my ankles after tripping over gopher holes in the grass on the side of the road. I swear a lot of this design is not pedestrian ignorant, it‚Äôs actually designed that way out of spite.

What you are experiencing is going to continue to hurt, but what I can tell you is that we are all here for you and slowly but surely your pain will become Wisdom. Focus on your health and you will climb out of rock bottom. It's not going to take a week, month or even years to get over it. Start meditating, working out, and writing down your goals. A man with no goals in life will become what he fears. Any second you decide to give up remember why and who you are doing it for. May your Mother rest in peace and may she see her son become someone he never thought he could be. Best wishes to you brotha, you will make her proud.

Me neither.  Was told I was immune for minimum 90 days based on current data at that time.  First test was unlikely a false positive because my roommate was also positive (tested after I got my results).  

This time I had a lot more symptoms and have had ZERO taste or smell for 8 days.  

Was told that since the first time around was so mild, that I likely didn't have enough antibodies built up.

With that said, this seems to be pretty rare and have had scientists contact me about ( I guess positive results get sent off to some data center where it's evaluated in my state).

Sounds like some fake bullshit but this is true.  Going to be interesting to see how the vaccine shakes out.  Hopefully it provides a robust immune response so additional exposures are actually nipped in the bud.
"Bears"... it's a part of that lexicon.
Vaccines only work if the majority of the population takes it smooth brain.

You vaccinate the at-risk population, great. 90% of them are immune, 10% of them are not. The rest of the population is now guaranteed to spread the virus to the at-risk 10% due to their carelessness and lack of oversight.

You just slaughtered that 10%. They didn't stand a chance.
No.
Airlines toast until stimmy talks. Great long-term play though.

There are no trade limits besides how much cash and margin you have available to use. Exception is PDT restriction for day trades on margin accounts with less than $25,000.
Asia gonna make it red. Then EU pump. We going to stay flat until tomorrow morning. Bears can go back to their caves. Bull can go back to their cages.

Because, first of all, it doesn‚Äôt have a 99% survival rate. On top of that, you don‚Äôt have a legal right or a moral right to spread diseases, even if they are survivable.

So, I‚Äôll be continuing to vote in favor of a forced vaccination program, not just for COVID, but for every disease with an R0 above 1.

I like that brake and gas approach. I think it also has to do with the weak dollar. Devaluing too much now will increase prices to high for most citizens. 

From a national security perspective, a strong dollar keeps China at bay from going into a strong market environment. I think they‚Äôre wanting to squeeze more countries into maintaining their backing of the dollar. 

We‚Äôre not too far off from a US China conflict as China is now making overt moves to challenge the US as the world leader. The US won‚Äôt give that up without a fight, although they won‚Äôt be looking for one either.

I went 50K into FVRR FSTLY ZM CHGG and OSTK last Thursday and I'm feeling pretty good about it for this week. I don't think vaccines will pump much more if at all. We are headed into a very "dark winter" and most people won't even get vaccinated until spring or summer of next year. People might not get vaccinated at all if they perceive it to not be safe. There are not very many uncertainties left in politics. Biden will be the victor. Although I do think that Democrat-friendly stonks will go up more in December after the electoral vote. I think EVs might take a cool down soon as ppl realize just what the fuck they are pouring their money into. Money flows. Always. Just got to figure out where. And I think it is likely to flow back into beaten down tech companies with good financials, profits, track record of momentum, and/or good staying power (success even after re-opening). Hence my choices above.

And yes. I know this is Wendy's.

But once again, can they prevent the same type of margin-call domino effect that happened in 1929?

Other than just random bad luck, the only thing I can think of is that the Buckle is a higher end store. There clothes are pretty expensive or at least more expensive that the other stores I‚Äôve quoted. I assume it has something to do with that because people are buying things but they are being more careful with what they buy which involves searching for lower prices.

I've meet 2 smart dividen investors. Like 60k in coe McDonald's att and a bunch of other shit. Dividen to growth. Basically they use their divisens to buy growth stocks, and they hit their 100% return cash out original investment and buy more growth or dividen shit. Smart but that requires tons of time. And I don't have the attention span for that.

Options aren't investing period. Buying shares is investing because you are "invested" in the company by providing them your money to use (they can sell their own shares to you to make capital for business operations). Options aren't useful to the company and they can't use your money. You're just investing in the college fund of a MM.

The double shift is starting halfway through this month but we won't get good numbers from that until they streamline the logistic chain in a few months from now.

If we assume 8k a month with 2 factories on double shift its only 192k, well short of 300k. They would need to build 2 new factories which the Chinese government and there gac factories could definitely make happen.
probably, but this caveat of my DD is buying the 12/18 was obviously safer. there was no catalyst, its just the fact this stock is on a long term up trend...

News will come when they release sales numbers. We are at still at the rumor part. Price on Friday was factoring in a good chance of delay.
buy her some tits you stingy son of a bitch
Ok that was a nice response, thanks for the longread haha  
So but that goes right back to where we started right? A system that would tax you in brackets as you called it is much fairer imo.  
Now, i do get that what you're saying about paying forever but like i said, i'm proud of my country and i want everyone to benefit:) 

now i read the article of course and i get the point being laid out but also i can't seem to shake the feeling that it's a bit of a strawman here right? Or more like, sure so maybe it doesn't work to give people individual loans (and then taking them away, damn:) but that doesn't mean there's no other way of making education more accessible. Here for instance we subsidize the school per student, so there's no free money for the student (and we control the prices of the schools of course bc we know they would try to raise tuition haha), and we subsidize the student if elligible by giving them a loan (for rent and food and books i guess) that becomes a partial gift only if they graduate within a set amount of time.  
Some years ago our liberal government changed the system so that everything was now a loan but recently we've reverted back because it just didn't work. Actually the gift was a better economic stimulus apparently.   


In the end it seems to be down to different viewpoints, it feels like you see education as an instrument for capital gain maybe? And i see (or try to see) education also as a tool for developing oneself just mainly because, it's nice to develop yourself:)  


On the last point tho we can agree:) I have a college education and while i do use it in my professional field as well as private life (i'm also thinking about maybe getting a second degree next year) I've also drifted into metalworking, welding and teaching because, beside me really liking those things better than sitting on my ass, it pays easily as much as a college level office job haha  
I have a hunch that the crossroads between technical jobs and things like philosophy are going to be a thing in the future, i hope;)

I will have to present my counterargument again-

1. Neither Inari, nor Dexcom or Livongo have an inferior product. They all have a top class product that offer a significant advantage to what is offered. Take for example, Inari's Flowtriever system that eliminates blood loss during the procedure. That is unheard of and doctors are raving about this product. I have a few docs that I follow in Twitter and they post images of the how good Flowtriever and Clotriever are; they are recommending other doctors to use it too. Can the same happen for Butterfly? Can it wow those folks enough that the hospital admin is sort of forced to buy them and not use traditional ultrasound instrument? I mean what exactly is the distinguishing advantage other than the fact that this is portable? I can tell you this--hospital and research labs are very reluctant in using a personal cell phone and hooking it to their system. There is a lot of sensitive patient info and for that reason their devices are standalone and data transfer highly secured.

2. Agreed they are affordable. But is affordability a real concern for hospitals? Think of it yourself. I can see this being adopted if it offers a safety feature that no one else in the world can. Or some distinguishing moat. Eg Dexcom was the "first" glucose monitor so that in itself was revolutionary. Livongo's device is the "first of its kind" that significantly improved the lifestyle of diabetic patient. What is it that butterfly offers? Something to ponder.
Can someone please explain to me the reference of theta gang? Put sellers?

My thing now is this. Do I wait for a possible dip to $47-$48 or will it not dip that low and stay above the $49 area? Leaving the only option to get back in at $49 & giving back all my profit plus chipping in another $20 to get back in. I feel $60-$70 is doable for Nio by December.

I've posted this elsewhere and is no B.S.  But I'm currently quarantining with a SECOND symptomatic positive test/infection 8 weeks from initial test.

The first one was mild so the doctors think I had a limited immune response. Not likely to be an initial false positive as my roommate also was positive.  Had a negative test in between that first positive and this positive.  Had more intense symptoms this time.  This is rare and has gotten the attention of people.  

Not nearly enough data at all for this virus, only one year so far.

But in the wise words of my Washington Heights mentors, "porque no los dos?" The funding could have been pulled in combination with an FDR WPA plan and didn't have to be now. Interest rates can't go lower unless we go negative which I don't even understand the implications of that.

It would have been better to ease on the brake while pushing on the gas at the same moment. The timing seems sus to me. The notice said that "funding can be redeployed for the same purpose if needed" but like why not just keep it there and then recall it when needed for something else? It was already regulated. And to redeploy it means running through a more contentious and fractured congress all over again.

I dunno. Seems shifty and power grabby to me. And I love the roads and rails idea too, but no way a GOP senate greenlights a plan that would be big enough. Remember what had to happen to make 08' bailouts happen? And that temperature was downright friends at a bar on Friday compared to now.

It doesn't matter whether you intent to do tax fraud or not. Make sure you do things the proper way. You know why? Because the IRS is able to declare that you calculated your tax wrong, redetermine your tax debt, apply interest and then also drag your ass to court.

Anyone getting dirty with Best Buy with earnings coming up?
Ah yeah, I‚Äôve noticed that pattern, but the dollar weakened last week and we went sideways, so not an exact science I guess. I also saw that gold was going up as investors are hedging against definite inflation, so that keeps cash out of the banks. At least that‚Äôs the idea.

Yeah but solar isn‚Äôt as available as hydrogen (or so I‚Äôm told) at the moment. So I just don‚Äôt see the solar market printing yet. In 5 years hydrogen may become obsolete as clean energy companies completely blow up and make more effective tech (like solar panels) This is a short term hold for me but so far I‚Äôve taken my losses

It might pull back, but unlike some recent SPACs, this one actually has revenue.

I think it's a long-term hold.  But I also think the Biden administration is going to drop a few B's on expanding electric vehicle infrastructure.

Agreed. With Thanksgiving, rising cases, lockdowns, I think ZM is a good short/medium term play. ER also Nov 30th after close. I agree that ZM is overvalued and will consolidate in the springtime at a non-speculative price.

$9 by end of year seems reasonable if everything goes well. $200M is what EvaluatePharma shows as 2024 consensus (technically they have it at $217M). $335M in 2026. I'm sure expectations can go up if BCRX performs and de-risks along the way. BCRX will likely never have positive earnings and it doesn't matter if they create a valuable asset. They could get acquired early and PE will still be negative. They can launch, ramp up sales and still operate at a loss, and it again doesn't matter as long as revenue growth is substantial. If you look at some recent specialty pharma deals like ALXN/PTLA, PTLA never had positive earnings but they were taken out for $1.4B.
It‚Äôs not looking good because of total lack of patience.

Housing prices just keep going up is the reason to act now (imo).

Honestly, I think its about being in position for the post-COVID, Dem in the white house, neo-Liberalism as policy times. Lots of good reasons to expect housing prices to go up.

The stock market is correlated with DXY. EURUSD and GBP USD, weighing heavily in DXY, being up meaning that the Dollar is weakening. DXY weakening usually results in futures and eventually the stock market rallying.

Theta gang is like being a valet at the casino, yeah you make some cash and its a lot safer but still lame af. Also one day some dude might run you over and and you lose all your money to hospital bills.
Personally, I think they were betting on this virus or the people to not care anymore. Now that we are doing shit downs again, we cannot hold off deflationary pressures any longer. So why throw ‚Äúfunding‚Äù at a falling knife. Pull the band aid off and lower interest rates again, stim to the people, and begin gov programs to put people back to work (building roads and stuff).
I mean you‚Äôll probably make money but you could make way more in other plays
I'd watch how it plays out. Don't panic sell instantly if it drills at open. My gut feeling is that it might drill hard early and then buyers will move in later in the day. If it's trending back up by EOD then I think you'll be in good shape.

Already up 30% on my XOM 1/23 35C.   Gtfo so I can buy this dump tomorrow
No. I think the ER run up will start this week. Nov 30th after close is ER. Here are my reasons: lockdown news, rising cases, free ZM unlimited time on Thanksgiving as well as encouragement to use ZM versus visiting. College using ZM etc. Also last ER had a good run up then around a 40%+ ER pop. ZM has been bearish and down last month based off vaccine news. FDA vaccine approval is around Dec 10/12. Long term ZM imo is overvalued, however, i think ZM will still be around in a post covid world for sure. Holding 12/18 500c x 5, bought EOD Thurday. Up 40%. I don't think I will hold through ER. Maybe one contract for a Yolo. Good luck man and any questions just hit me up.

That‚Äôs true, but its higher chance you make profit. And that profit is already higher than just holding shares. Which is the whole point of leaps. Which is believing in sth going up in the long term but want leverage.

But hey if you are greedy and want the other end of the spectrum then do OTM.

This is provided that you actually made significant money. Pretty sure most people here won't make more than $20k/year in the market, in which case (assuming it's all short term gain) the amount is just added to your yearly income and taxed at whatever rate you'd end up with the new total, no?

In short: liquidity run potential 2.0 is in the air. The bailout and low interest let central banks breathe and ease up on their liquidity decisions so they could make market moves again. Removing that buffer could trigger another liquidity run (possibly the fear beginning on friday) especially on the eve of more mass shutdowns. It also seems like a particularly targeted and unnecessarily punitive measure from the executive branch intended as a major fuck you, you weren't grateful for my help and didn't elect me so I'm taking my toys home. 

It's a way different temperature than March so the crash won't be as bad, there are far fewer unknowns, but there are enough that in sure central banks are getting shifty wondering if they need a rainy day fund now, and if Mango is gonna pull some other weird vindictive stuff that could spin the market.

Exactly, the problem with software companies is well... that other entities can build software too, this happened with a lot of 2000 overvalued software companies, other players just created their own versions of the same software. And it's even worse since their brand doesn't sell directly to general public (like facebook, twitter, etc.) so their brand value is almost worthless. And also because other governments have the infrastructure to easily build similar software or just hire another companies. Yeah they won this lawsuit this time but they wont win every time, unless they lobby until the judgment day the shit out of politicians ofc, but seems hard to pull that off.

Ended up selling on Monday when it got that 2% pop.  Had a bad feeling about the price level and didn't think it had much more room to run
ah that sucks.
 Cause I‚Äôve been holding for two weeks now
I had 100% of my money in recovery stocks.  I sold all my recovery stock option calls last week was planning on buying back in at lower price as the virus spike will potentially have additional restrictions put in place. I could be wrong but I'm up in the green after being down 50% in Sept.
Can I ban Myself? I'm going to join the Cryps because my options are in ROPEland
Tesla is my only long term position

How much are you paying in taxes
My 11 year old plays this every second we let her play video games.

She said boys AND girls play this in their class.

75% of kids in America aged 9-12 play RoBlox.

My daughter also said the game comes out with massive updates during the holiday season. I expect player engagement to explode on their first CC.

Minecraft was bought out by Microsoft. This stock will also likely get bought up within a few years.
Yeah I‚Äôm 1300 shares deep with average cost of .55, first bought in at .30 then doubled down in the .80s.
Yeah
But you want to buy calls, so I should buy puts?

It is the way.
Imagine having that much money. Can I have some?

Yes, but that's why they're easy in the first place.
How many EV companies do you all think are going to actually survive? That‚Äôs the real question. There will only be a hand full that actually make it, while there are probably 20-25 different start-ups. Tesla was a week away from bankruptcy about a year ago. Tesla made it through to the other side, I doubt that most of these other EV makers will make it. Just stick with Tesla who has their hands in the pots of other growth areas as well as EV.

Easy. All you have to do is implement extremely complicated tax evasion strategies all the while not really executing those strategies correctly. Then have fundamentally flawed business ventures that rely heavily on screwing every one who partnered with you along the way, only to be sued by said partners later on and default on crazy high interest loans that have no collateral. Finally, file for bankruptcy to avoid paying anyone and jail time.

It's not easy being THAT incompetent. It takes years of experience and natural talent.
People are saying it historically does but idk if this year might be different

How much longer until I can get a boner from watching futures?
I mean who‚Äôs to say if the SBE run is over, it would be surprising if it went up more than 20% more, but with a SPAC stock like GIK premerger, its 11 right now but could only go down to $10 minimum and is guaranteed to get a pop once deal is announced. So I say the risk reward is light years better

Pretty simple.  Account for your gains and don't have all your money locked into positions when the new year rolls around.  Pay the taxes and resume doing business as usual. 


At this point in the year I tend to leave the tax money in cash so I can just withdraw it when tax man wants it.

Weird how all Chads are trump supporters.
The vaccine news looked like it dropped the stock 20% in a day, what are you smoking?

Saying that if you still believe in remote learning despite the vaccines I think it‚Äôs a good play. It‚Äôs started to gain back since the vaccine news drop.

unlimited margin
If you are extremely confident that your trade will work out, go for it and buy them. I would suggest buying contracts that are further dated (at least 2 months from the day you buy them) in case you end up being wrong with timing of the move. Needless to say, if the move you think is going to happen doesn't happen, those contracts are gonna be worth nothing, because you won't be able to sell them. Do you mind sharing what trade you were thinking of making?
Urghh weekend so boring I forced myself to do work so that I can gamble all day Monday.

Just go to the FBI database and look at the charges for espionage. Recently a Chinese national got charged 3 years for stealing defense secrets from RTX. Pretty sure he's a national hero now and a multimillionaire and no one even notices, nor really cares in the U.S.. If a U.S. citizen did this in China, they would be either executed or sentenced to hard labor for life.

Not to mention they probably own more U.S. land than anyone else, so what's the point of going to war, they would just hurt their own real estate values and investments.

Who cares which grumpy old man is president?  Biden will likely pass in 2 years and we'll have Kamala take over, whatever.  What I care about is the BS narratives that are fed to people.  If the vaccine was bad because Trump led the effort, then stick with it, otherwise you are full of crap and shouldn't be trusted EVER.  At the end of the day, all I will do is adjust where I invest.  More TSLA, maybe CRWD, find some green energy etc.

I saw a documentary a while back that showed it actually has a lot to do with their culture of eating small meals to the point where they don't fully satiate their hunger. It keeps the body in a conserving state believing food to be scarce, hardwired all the way back to when we evolved to survive famine/long periods without food.

And this actually has a protective affect on the body and its cells. At least this was the theory in the doc. Made sense too, very interesting.

My opinion..... Stonks like NIO could easily fall 20% in a week screwing yourself further.  If you want to make it all back expect about a year, but wheeling a volatile stonk at its bottom like RKT might be good.  They've got no real risk of falling too terribly much, but plenty of IV to keep things juicy.  I'll be wheeling this shortly with about the same stack size.  $1,500 a month easily.

You‚Äôll be in the clear. PDT is limited to the specific account number that went over 3 day trades, not your identity/SS. The new one is a different account number but still registered under your same info. 

The new one will be opened as a cash account but will have no restrictions. That‚Äôs why you need to remove margin from the original PDT account and that one becomes a cash account also

Once margin is on your new account, it‚Äôs a fresh virgin account with no restrictions and full access to day trades
So i know it‚Äôs lame here to talk about shares, but at currently price I could get ~1,400 shares. That‚Äôs 14 covered calls I could play selling OTM weeklies. What do you see PLTR being at in 3-6 months?

We‚Äôre due for a mild pullback while cases and hospital occupancy spikes before the insane bull run that will be 2021 (that will start mid Dec due to Vaccine being approved/ administered). Fear will win in the short term IMO. 

This isn‚Äôt talking at all about the chance ü•≠ becomes more reckless the fewer legal avenues he has.

Just speculation, but I‚Äôve put a lot of money in SPY puts (that are already up 40-50%).
The most important thing for the markets is fed stimulus. Don‚Äôt matter if we have a vaccine or if we have WW3, the markets will move depending on whether or not the fed can keep buying bad debt from companies

Yes. Open a new individual account first and link it to your main one. 

Then go to the message center and tell them you want to remove margin. Internally transfer your funds to the new linked account. 

Either tomorrow or Tuesday the margin removal will have been processed and the fund transfer should be complete

Then apply for margin on the new account, this will be applied instantly, and boom your ready to trade on an unrestricted margin account

Should take you 1-2 business days to be trading like a degen again

Mobileye's robotaxis for the latter's global fleet will start commercially in 2022. Share price will shoot into another galaxy.

I keep reporting political bullshit and you fuckers are still here. SLV calls!
Average true range is the delta of the high and low for a period. By default it‚Äôll give a moving average of the last 14 periods. It‚Äôs a volatility indicator. Sell calls when ATR is high and starting to move downward if you want to keep your shares. It‚Äôs a good starting point, but news catalysts could spike ATR and still jeopardize your shares.
Ok
So.... SELL SELL SELL?

But investing WSB, BUY BUY BUY?

Wow
Did you guys know you can open multiple TD accounts and have them all linked together?

I currently have 8 accounts and when the opportunities right I‚Äôll do 10+ day trades on a single one to basically sacrifice it like a forbidden sharingan technique

You can only have one margin account at a time though so when you sacrifice one, you just remove margin from the one that‚Äôs about to get PDT banned (takes 1 business day to process margin removal) and then internally transfer your portfolio to the next one while also applying for margin after it is removed from the previous one

One day of trading downtime is literally the only hassle that comes with this. You can even do this more conservatively by running up 3 day trades on one account then transfer margin and funds to the next one while waiting for those 3 day trades to fall off.

If your scalping with a sub 25k account, this is a god send strategy

To thst note, I have 950 trades this year I think... I have 670 realized gains.... 1400 will be added from pton call and zm. I have 8300 in unrealized gains from enph may 2021 calls and jan 2022 call. If I sell those come jan 1 2022, I dont pay taxes on those come April of 2022? Right?? Also I have 15k in wash sale... wash sale prevents you from using those losses. Wash sale DOES not make you pay more in taxes guys. It is a nothijg burger. With that being said next year I'll know to use less wash sale and trade less and actually find stocks to long. I do think we get a crash in jan..

It's like that, yes. Its an "Extended-Range" EV. The small gas engine generates electricity. 

> Extended-range electric vehicles

> The extended-range electric vehicle (E-REV) is effectively an all-electric vehicle, with all the motive power provided by an electric motor, but with a small ICE present to generate additional electric power. Alternatively, it may be viewed as a series hybrid with a much larger battery, namely, 10‚Äì20 kWh; see Table 5.3. When the battery is discharged to a specified level, the ICE is switched on to run a generator that, in turn, supplies power to the electric motor and/or recharges the battery. With this arrangement, the range limitation that is inherent in a BEV can be overcome. For moderate distances, E-REVs can operate in full-electric mode and are then as clean and energy-efficient as BEVs (unlike parallel hybrids and other series hybrids with their smaller batteries and very limited electric range). For longer distances, E-REVs utilize the ICE to keep the battery charged, but consume noticeably less fuel than conventional ICEVs for the following two reasons:

> (i) The engine of an E-REV is significantly smaller than that of a conventional ICEV ‚Äì it only needs to meet average power demands because peak power is delivered by the battery pack. The engine of an ICEV, on the other hand, must also cover peak-power surges, e.g. accelerations.

> (ii) The engine of an E-REV operates at a constant, highly efficient, rotation speed; whereas that of an ICEV often runs at low or high rotation speeds during which, in both situations, its efficiency is low.

What bubble. Solo is only worth 1BB wait till it hits 100BB
Good/bad/nothing?
No, it‚Äôs not genius. Plenty have tried before SOLO. And the car doesn‚Äôt fix urban transit issues. If you were concerned about that you‚Äôd go for EV buses like CIIC (arrival). There are plenty of small cars that have came and went. People though the smartcars were the move. if you wanted a tiny EV a Nissan Leaf is already perfectly sized. The car is ugly, slow and wouldn‚Äôt save you any significant amount of money if you were to buy a used smart car or hybrid. It‚Äôs barely a step above a bicycle.
I can‚Äôt keep up with all these SPACs. Can someone please just make a 3x EV SPAC ETF please. I‚Äôll put 100k into it

Get mad all you like, your priorities are fucked. 

The best investment you could make right now is in your career....if you need to work 70-100 hours a week @ 23/hr, your focus shouldn‚Äôt be in stocks/options; it should be on how you can get into a better employment situation

On the 1 hand this is clearly a scam. These guys have no clue how to manage a business or look to the future. They just want money to spend in the now.

On the other hand, it‚Äôs early in the lifecycle of this scam and it‚Äôs possible that it makes us some money before it implodes

Make sure you are plotting actual production per qtr, NOT peak run rate. CEOs often marketing-speak about peak theoretical run rate.

It looks like you are comparing Tesla actual vs NIO theoretical peak.

Rolling in this week with some short $TNA $52.50c. Really want to get assigned. Want to take my profits and continue spinning the wheel in a better position.

Also holding $AAPL shares and forgot to sell a call on Friday. Hoping it rallies and I can sell it and then get assigned on $KO so I can get assigned to the dividends on Monday.

Besides all of this, cut a lot of sugar out of diet and feeling a bit on edge. A frustrating amount honestly. Probably one of the few things I‚Äôm technically addicted to.

Interesting thing about PLTR, not a traditional IPO, but they DO have a lock up period. (unusual for direct offering) Expect it to dwindle down until Dec earnings then a little more after lock up releases (employees selling earned shares).  After that I expect a moon.
So this means calls right

Whatever happens this week, keep your heads up for you are kings üëë
None taken but it‚Äôs been fed some meme steroids and hasn‚Äôt reached the place where the only people buying are speculators.

Can usually tell what stage meme stocks are in by the cost of leaps and PLTR leaps are super expensive.  So folks think it still has long legs.
Those are Western prices. In their home market, which is by far their largest market, it's completely different. 

¬£799 ~ ¬•7000.

Going one tier up to ¬£999 takes the Chinese consumer to ¬•8700. That's not a trivial difference because Chinese average incomes are not at all comparable to British or any other Western incomes. At that scale, an iPhone that costs only a little more at ¬•9000 is a far more sensible option, being their perceptions of "premium."

You're not taking into account their largest market and the local income of that market. China makes up the lion's share of Xiaomi, Oppo, and whatever else brands' income. The average income of white-collar Chinese people in the rich cities is only ¬•8000. These phones literally cost more than their entire incomes every month. 

Xiaomi is not going to be a worthy proposition considering they're both too premium to compete against Oppo and Vivo, who have far less expensive options, and not as premium as Huawei or Apple, who have dedicated premium user bases.

No! My buddy does I need to learn too üòÇ and exactly that's what I've been saying. NIO doesn't need to become a dominant force In China to do well since the positioned themselves in the luxury segment with differentiation, things such as battery swap, BaaS NIO houses , NIO power, NOMI and end to end customer care (have the highest satisfaction of any manufacturer In China even Mercedes etc). By 2023 25% of those 4.4 million must be EV's and by 2030 all of them must be EV's and obviously that 4.4 million will grow. NIO already has well above 5% of the EV market share In China and is only just getting started. I see this company becoming as big as Tesla is in the US at one stage, since they have entered the lower end market as well with their not nio branded NIO-GAC 007.

Correct. Any gains not realized are not a tax concern.

Never doin coke and watching gary vee again

edit: puts on BABA
I think the main reason I blew through money was that I didn‚Äôt have any long or even short term financial goals. After college I wanted a car really bad so i had an incentive to save my money. Once I started saving up it became harder to spend it and I just kept going all the way to $10k cause It became harder to let it go. Originally wanted to get like $2k and finance some  later model sports shit, instead just paid $5k cash for something more economical. 

So I guess just start with a goal. Maybe challenge her to save $1k in 90 days and see if she does it
You won't regret it, been trading it all year and up 300% i have 50 shares at an abg for 112. Which i won't sell, I got 2 may 2021 95 calls and on Jan 125 call

In dudeitsadell's case, he is suggesting re-investing realized gains. He will still need to pay taxes on realized gains, provided that he is still net positive at the end of the fiscal year.

Hypothetically speaking, if all of your gains were unrealized you wouldn't need to pay taxes?

Here's Huawei's best flagship at the moment:  The \[Mate 40 Pro +\]([https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/phones/p40-pro-plus/buy/](https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/phones/p40-pro-plus/buy/)) is priced at ¬£1299 (they do have a more expensive foldable that we'll ignore). They have a \[P40 lite E\]([https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/phones/p40-lite-e/buy/?skucode=80440110010002904](https://consumer.huawei.com/uk/phones/p40-lite-e/buy/?skucode=80440110010002904)), cheaply priced at ¬£139.99 .  From their latest phone series (mate/p 40s) they have 3 cheap ones(<¬£300), 2 mid price (<¬£700), and 2 premium (>¬£1000).

Now looking at Xiaomi, their website is a bit more of a pain to use as it doesn't show the prices immediately but from what I can tell their most expensive product is the \[Mi 10\]([https://www.mi.com/uk/buy/product/mi-10](https://www.mi.com/uk/buy/product/mi-10)) at ¬£799 . I expect the Mi 10 pro is more expensive but there isn't a buy option on the website that I can see. They have a couple phones priced 500-600 (mi 10T and mi note 10). Other than that, they offer loads of cheap phones. Their entire Redmi series is very budget friendly.

It's hard to compare the phones in terms of performance as Huawei offer their own chips whereas Xiaomi use snapdragons. Huawei also don't have Google on their phones - which I and \[others\]([https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/huawei-reportedly-expecting-a-20-drop-in-phone-sales-thanks-to-export-ban/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/huawei-reportedly-expecting-a-20-drop-in-phone-sales-thanks-to-export-ban/)) believe to be the reason its sales plummeted. Clearly outside of China this put Xiaomi as the phone of choice out of the 2 brands.

I'll talk about Oppo too (I personally own  a Reno 2 :) ). They have 3 lines: the find series (flagships costing up to \[¬£999.99\]([https://oppomobiles.co.uk/smartphones/find-x2-series.html](https://oppomobiles.co.uk/smartphones/find-x2-series.html)) ); the reno series (mid range phones up to \[¬£699.99\]([https://oppomobiles.co.uk/smartphones/reno-series.html](https://oppomobiles.co.uk/smartphones/reno-series.html)) ); and the A series (budget phones). The x2 find phone has the same chip as the Mi 10, it does have more RAM (12gb vs 8gb) and a higher refresh rate screen (120 vs 90 fps) but it is also ¬£200 more expensive. There are rumours the next Xiaomi phones will all feature high refresh rate and be the first to feature the new snapdragon chip likely to be getting \[announced next month\]([https://www.slashgear.com/snapdragon-875-is-coming-what-to-expect-from-the-flagship-chipset-10641808/](https://www.slashgear.com/snapdragon-875-is-coming-what-to-expect-from-the-flagship-chipset-10641808/)). 

I think Oppo and Xiaomi are pretty close in competition in regards to the phones they produce and their prices, and I can't wait to see the potential of the sliding phone that Oppo demonstrated earlier in the week! I think your judgement that Xiaomi is in a weird spot in the market is completely wrong. I think outside of China Huawei will continue to fall short, especially for its pricing, and Xiaomi will continue to grow (I'm hoping they come into phone providers, like EE, in the UK for this time next year when my contract runs out lol). I do think Oppo is a big rival for Xiaomi in the market and that they're competing for a similar spot - but I can only invest in 1 as the other isn't a public company.

&#x200B;

Here's the current mobile market shares globally - you can clearly see Xiaomi stole marketshare from Huawei [https://www.statista.com/statistics/271496/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-vendors-since-4th-quarter-2009/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271496/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-vendors-since-4th-quarter-2009/)
IQIYI struggles to turn a profit and hiked its subscription fees.

IQIYI thing is to have a lot of free stuff and then reel customers in with premium blockbusters.

I would prefer Bilibili as a stock, they do amazing with China's Gen Z, even Sony pours money into them. 

Not that I can predict the future, but if I had the choice and I do I would invest into Bilibili over IQIYI.. or you know just get both

 Gunnery Sergeant Hartman : That's affirmative. Charles Whitman killed twelve people from a twenty-eight-story observation tower at the University of Texas from distances up to four hundred yards. Anybody know who Lee Harvey Oswald was? Private Snowball?

Private Snowball : Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!

Gunnery Sergeant Hartman : That's right, and do you know how far away he was?

Private Snowball : Sir, it was pretty far! From that book suppository building, sir!

Gunnery Sergeant Hartman : All right, knock it off! Two hundred and fifty feet! He was two hundred and fifty feet away and shooting at a moving target. Oswald got off three rounds with an old Italian bolt action rifle in only six seconds and scored two hits, including a head shot! Do any of you people know where these individuals learned to shoot? Private Joker?

Private Joker : Sir, in the Marines, sir!

Gunnery Sergeant Hartman : In the Marines! Outstanding! Those individuals showed what one motivated marine and his rifle can do! And before you ladies leave my island, you will be able to do the same thing!

Dec 8-10 FDA emergency use authorization meeting, Dec 11th fed runs out of $, calls for stimulus will be overwhelming since local governments will shut down everything the week before, Dec 14th Electoral has to vote.  Granted some of these could move against you. If the stimulus and FDA hit though before the 14th the market will juice.  Key is you have to be in before since all that will happen pre or ah.  Good luck.

It's not for the prison guards specifically. It's for everyone because it's an enclosed space. It wouldn't work if you only vaccd the guards. It's also possible to get diseases you're vaccinated against. All the vaccine does is give your cells a memory of dead virus particles so it can fight it better than when you were vaccinated. If the inmates are sneezing right next to each other non-stop they'll still get it. 

Also specifically no I wouldn't care. I wouldn't even have prisons if it was up to me.

I guess my question is about exercising the leap. Is this automatic or are you given some grace period between when the option to sold gets exercised and when you have to sell them the shares. And of course this would require you to have enough to buy those shares to exercise your leap.

Can't wait for RH to give me my 0DTE option
Is the average loss here only 200%?? 

I'm up 150% on my garbage penny stock that I got for a literal penny. been volatile. Been up 200%, been up 25%, regularly gain or lose big percentages. Good training.  


My value play is down so I'm buying more. It's also a penny stock. It's a gold exploration company that owns the land, has access to roads, no debt, money in the bank, did well post-2008. It stands apart. I'm expecting a gold rush eventually because there is always a gold rush eventually. Gives me time to buy a stock that troughed at $0.08 in Nov 2008, and peaked at $9 two years later for a quarter a share. Gold rush material.  


And then Mindmed (used to be a mineral exploration company), which I should have bought at 30 cents, but waited like a fool until it hit 1.19. Now I'm up 40% instead of 450%.  


If I ever have money for options then I will pay a professional their $400 fee and put ten grand into whatever they want. Until then, it's clear penny stocks are the way. Beaten down cyclicals. Behavioral economics. Humans like gold. I'm poor. Long term compounding won't work with my quarterly $1200 portfolio contributions. I have to diversify with shaky value principles in something with a long runway, and then sell to optimists. Risk without debt, risk without options, risk with time to buy and grow, or lose. Lose small win big.  


I blew it with Tupperware though. Watched it at 2$, left it alone because I doubt plastic's future. Missed a ten bagger. I've made terrible mistakes.  


Must start a business with low equipment costs, low risk, high margin. Cash flow. Build the machine. Work for no one. Get actualy money. Buy boomer stocks and hold for decades. Compound. Amass shares SHARES. CAT, Altria, Disney, RBC, TD, Scotia, BMO, etc.... build the machine... Start by buying garbage that nobody wants, and never listen to WSB.

Interesting because my assumption was they probably bought at all time highs in the last year or two and even selling at today's inflated prices leads to two problems-- factoring in agent commission, recording fees and closing costs they would probably lose some $$$ in the deal and second they probably need another house nearby so unless they can arbitrage it's almost a losing proposition.

Sure, buying a house outright and never having debt is great. Except you still have monthly bills. You still have property taxes and repairs, and possibly HOA fees depending on where and what you buy. Yes, having no debt can be great, but if you want to grow wealth and do better long term, mortgage debt is much better to have then 250k into a house that isn't necessarily going to appreciate in value.

Best part about this is the Supreme Court doesn't try cases the same as the lower courts. It's not like some new decision would be made with fresh faces.

The evidence and lack thereof has been repeatedly laughed out of court. SC will not hear this, and even if it did, would decidedly reaffirm lower court decisions.

So honest question. Doordash has 45% of third-party delivery orders. The next runner up is UberEats at 28%. Doordash went all the way up to series H funding. It's valued at 16 billion. It made 1 billion in profits last year. But this is the second time in a row my order takes over 2 hrs to get delivered. How successful will doordash's ipo be? Prob very.

Yeah that's plausible. I have a feeling it wont move more than 2.5% either way by the end of this week.
Lol. Commercial enterprise & consumer software is extremely talent-driven. That's why you see FAANG offer exorbitant comp packages to even low level engineers and product managers, stack their campuses with "come work here" attractions and use extensive interview processes to find top talent. No top talent who has their pick of employers will go to Palantir. That's a problem. 

They could change it with a major culture shift and rebranding. The IPO will help them on the comp front. It's not going to happen quickly or easily though.

Yeah we shall see.  If their financial system is nothing but a fraud that isn't going to be sustainable long term.  When more of their companies start leading industries especially outside of China and its slanted market then we shall see.  People were saying how the Japanese were going to dominate us in the 1980s and they had much better brands than China does until very recently.

Right, that makes sense. My friends were also saying that doctors use very small bedside machines these days and they're almost just as portable as the handheld device (the handheld device would probably be more useful in a third-world country, for philanthropic purposes). Handheld devices are heavy and some scans take upwards of 30-45 minutes and require a lot of dexterity. The battery only lasts 1-2 hours. In addition, the device is connected to the users' phone. So wouldn't that breach patient confidentiality in any way?

You nailed it.  RH is designed to maximize dopamine rushes (rolling numbers, cartoon design, confetti orders)... Whereas ToS is all business.  But you can view charts, RSI, better fill priority, stellar customer service etc.

Yes, the Clarius is a little different. The wireless tech when I demo'd the product required line of sight to operate comfortably. This is kinda both it's pro and con. They need to make it more reliable and they may be superior, however they would require the doctor to buy multiple probes, usually 3 (convex, liner and phased array) where as the butterfly can simulate the different probes, although that's not perfect either. They have their uses currently but still don't replace full ultrasound yet.

"In theory, investors could short PLTR perhaps 7-10 days before the lock-up expiration. Or, traders could use short-term options - especially puts - to play the downside opportunity. It's unclear if there's enough downside potential to make this work. Then again, even a small dip could magnify profits because of option leverage. Please note that I'm talking here about short-term trades."

You're welcome.  I forgot to mention, that they sometimes won't check between separate accounts with the same broker, like if you have an IRA and a regular personal account.  It's actually a lot easier to account for than it sounds too.  All you have to do, is not buy back anything you've sold, less than 30 days prior.  If you do buy something back before 30 days, then just don't count any losses from the last sale.

There is still opportunity right now but it isn't as easy as buying monthlies and watching them double. The options market has been terrible at handicapping risk for months on SLV compared to GLD which makes being on the buy side more statistically profitable, but you still have to be right on the direction. Bad time to be selling.

I agree.  BABA is just Fukddd because of being a Chinese stock that can be manipulated at the whim of their government.  I mean it's bound to be bigger than AMZN eventually if they can keep market domination.  Definitely undervalued if it were an American company.

ZM is definitely overvalued but so is most tech.   At least it's making profits lol.  A company like PLTR worth in the Billions without profiting in 17 years.

[Source](https://medium.com/@watfly/will-chinese-evs-pull-a-tiktok-on-tesla-bf0a72777971). NIO's deliveries curve is about to overtake TSLA' deliveries curve (early TSLA back in 2014 that is). NIO CEO talked about increasing production rate to 150k to 300k units per year in 2021, which would put NIO well ahead of the curve.

In a way this is starting to look like TikTok vs Instagram growth chart. This makes me bullish on NIO. 

Some further DD: [NIO car interiors are on pair to Porsche, way ahead of Tesla](https://discord.com/channels/588137369409159208/602915459855024151/780157999502458921). Again, bullish on NIO.

Brokers, since they're all computer based, generally calculate that for you.  However, if you're using multiple brokers, and you sell on one, but buy on another, that wouldn't be factored in, because each broker looks at it's own data.  Also, you're supposed to check yourself, in case the broker doesn't automatically provide that feature, or misses some.  Remember that really similar securities count, not just the same ticker, but brokers can only auto-check for the same ticker, since the second type is partially subjective.  If a spouse buys the securities that you sold, using THEIR account, it counts as a wash too.  There's a very good chance though, that all of your inadvertent wash sales were automatically removed from your losses, and you're probably fine.

&#x200B;

Edit: And that wasn't a dumb question at all.  It's important to know these things before the Government explains them to you, at length, and in great detail lol.
casirivimab, as example:    
    
Naming is 4 parts: prefix, substem A, substem B, and suffix.    
Suffix: -mab for monoclonal antibodies (-pab would be polyclonal antibodies)    
Substem B: -i. This substem is for what organisms the antibodies came from, typically -xi- is for chimeric antibodies. But, per Regeneron's website, these are fully human antibodies, but created in modified mice (modified to have a humane immune system). I don't know how this works honestly, but likely they dropped the x because of substem A.    
Substem A: -v(i) for viral target, since it targets SARS-CoV2, a virus causing COVID-19. Likely drop the i because of the -i- from substem B.    
Prefix: typically up to the company.    
Disclaimer: this is a best guess from me, likely not fully accurate, but the base 4 parts are somewhat indicative of how MABs are named.
Same is happening to Niu, yes, Nio with a U. Everyone is sleeping on that gem ready to sky rocket.

He could  but if what he sold is deep in the money it's be for a major loss still.  Even then no guarantee that it would go back up like it did, just adding more risk.

Not all ThetaGang plays are full proof.  Especially when selling spreads.  Wheeling I guess is the least risky.

Well... it's not a "scam". Right now it's a West Coast thing (heard they going to Philly or somewhere out east). My whole office rode shares up from a buck and made bank, but closing my calls Thursday early and seeing them run up to almost close @ 11 seemed a bit shocking. They are not "a scam", but a play right now? Not at $11 IMO. Probably go back to 8 EOW. If it does that buy 12/18 C's.

Many people are asking: does the Weekend Dow have any predictive ability? Yes it does.  It is a very powerful too, indeed.  Open it up on IG and stare at it until it gives you the answers.  It will tell you when you will die.  It will tell you if you‚Äôll find love.  It will tell you if god exists.  It is a powerful tool indeed and many autists cannot handle the answers it gives.  Be warned, after looking your life will never be the same.  The horrors you‚Äôll see have seen cannot be unseen.  Also, does it have any ability to predict market open or futures? No.
An enormous amount of gamma rolled off the market this friday so tomorrow we either moon or drill and as we all know, the stock market is the economy and rich peoples muney and everyones retirement is tied up in this so we mooon

As a Chinese who witnessed this in person, no. People look towards Huawei for the kinds of products you just described. Xiaomi is stuck playing the tiny margin between flagship killer (Vivo, Oppo) and prestige brand (Huawei, Apple). Another brand in the same space but way more niche is ZTE. Apple profits way more per phone and Vivo and Oppo blow Xiaomi out the water with volume. 

Also, from a a Chinese perspective, Xiaomi is an order of magnitude more expensive than Oppo or Vivo.

Michigan has a lot of idiots. They're all going nuts about this most recent 'lockdown' when it isn't a lockdown. People losing their minds because they can't dine-in at Red Lobster and have to order out and shit like that. It's not even long term, just to hold over while hospitals are seeing high capacity. Check out the 'Real Michigan' subreddit for the real gems -- I know a lot of people who sound just like that crowd.

That community was created this spring because they were wondering why calling the governer 'Whitler' for establishing stay at home orders wasn't well received in the normal Michigan sub.
To me it just shows, even a combination of three EV( well Li is hybrid but retard here like to make it as an ‚ÄúEV‚Äù company) can‚Äôt compete with Tesla. Thing is , Tesla‚Äôs made in China price war has just started and those three simply does not have the gross profit margin to compete. Their business model has determined once Tesla starts making cars in China it is over to use price as a competition tool.

I mean, I've been thetaganging it for two months and, besides the week I lost 2k, I can make 2% a week easy. Theoretically you should be able to double your money in a year selling options- rinse and repeat to your heart's content.

The WSJ talks about the DJIA but mostly I think because they have ownership in common. And as messed up as price-weighting is, the "finger on the scale" way that components are included in the index makes up for it a little. It has a rough but intentional sector-weighting that skews a bit more boomer than most large cap indices, so it's not a total waste of time. When someone says "the DJIA outperformed the Nasdaq 100 on vaccine news" there's actual information content there.
I used robinhood to buy out robinhood
They don't really mean shit if it's anywhere between -1% to +1%. It can change by like .3 within 10 minutes sometimes. Futures kind of can indicate something if it's a margin of like 1.5+ in either direction
Dude the number that matters more is the percentage of people who are long or short. There is literally no money moving on the weekends so the indicator doesn‚Äôt matter unless it is down or up bigly

Do you want to do long- term low risk investing, if so this not the right sub. R/ investing or stocks a better place. This is mainly an options sub high risk high rewards almost gambling. There you'll get advice here you'll get someone telling you to YOLO all your money into the newest trending meme stock option. But to answer you'll need to get an account on one of the trading platforms. You tube the basics. Buying stocks and options is easy the hard part is making money. If you're really fresh maybe start out paper trading ( not real money) so you can get experience with the only cost being your time. Look for platforms that offer that.

Your wife is blasted. In a way she hasn‚Äôt been since baby was born. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you looking at?‚Äù she slurs.

You turn around and are surprised to see her bare chest. The darkness of her nipples contrasts sharply with her skin, but looks like a sibling of the wine in her hand. She smiles at your confused face, sheepishly. You collect yourself and respond coyly, ‚ÄúNot much.‚Äù

She moans in an exaggerated way as she bends down to open the black bag at her feet. ‚ÄúBut really, what are you looking at?‚Äù

You decide to humor her. She‚Äôs drunk and won‚Äôt remember anyway. ‚ÄúMy Palantir puts. Different strikes and expirations. It was a good day.‚Äù

She looks at you cross-eyed, then shrugs. ‚ÄúOkay, baby.‚Äù As she places plastic cups over her breasts, you ask her what she‚Äôs doing.

‚ÄúBaby can‚Äôt drink this.‚Äù She gestures at her chest, spilling some wine in the process. ‚ÄúPump and dump.‚Äù

You look back at the Palantir chart. ‚ÄúAh, yes.‚Äù

See that‚Äôs the risk with options it‚Äôs like the stock market a pyramid zero sum but here‚Äôs why people might want to buy options if they are ITM they can exercise the warrants print shares from an outstanding share pool and dump them on the market. There is an incentive to buy options. 

If they have 10 warrants they are allowed to buy 1000 shares at the strike price this goes through options clearing house etc etc and they will sell you shares from a pool at the strike price meaning if the strike price is 3$ but the market value is 50$ you can with these 10 warrants still get them for 3$s and the insurance company must sell these shares for 3$ to you.

Welcome to WSB
This definitely works on robinhood. So you‚Äôre selling the calls and then buying them back for close to nothing right before exercise. If you actually wait and they do exercise you would have to early exercise your leap and lose a ton of value

But because the leap will always be worth more you can always close it out even if it runs too much

It‚Äôs like calendar spreads if you read up on those. Just over and over

Depends if the market thinks we deserve to gap up on the regeneron news. If it's a repeat of the past Monday vaccine pumps then you should be able to unload those at open.

I'd be cautious about holding because the first vaccine pump gapped up massively then faded all day. The second vaccine pump went up til like 11am or so, faded hard, then only rebounded EOD.

You know some of us have been saying all along that ByteCorn is probably a decent idea. It feels incredibly comfortable to at least have one entire coin safely stored in a hardware wallet. It will become a real status symbol in a few years to have an entire coin, even now it's not pocket change. All we got from ya'll was crap, it's like a perpetual call option on a USB stick.
why?

Explaining to WSB newbies PLTR is a pump and dump is like explaining to Trump supporters they lost the election. They just don't want to accept reality. But but... The supreme court will win it for us! üòÖ
IBKR is downright negligent with their margin; what‚Äôs why they‚Äôre my broker or choice haha. Also consider that getting assigned on a naked call just leaves you with a short position. Same way getting assigned on a put leaves you with a long position. How quickly you have to cover that is between you and your broker.

The way I see it is that Stripe is best case scenario, merger happens, stock is valued between like $80-$100. In that case, my 11 35C 6/21 would be worth like 60k. 

Worst case, they stall on an announcement and stock is hovering around 23/24 and I'd be down 50-60% by the end of February, where the announcement would be made anyway. 

If it's a decent company, then hoping it goes at least 40+ and I can cash out or decide to hold. Best case.. Stripe... huge open..

I think it's more the lack of cars that force you to walk a ton. I lived on a steep mountain in yokohama for two years and I would get wrecked in fatigue walking it (29 at the time), but people over 90 were doing the same thing having conversations with each other.

Don't buy weeklies. Consider leveraged futures instead. If you buy 10x leveraged futures at $350, SPY can literally go to $315 before your instrument gets knocked off. No decay. Futures are cool.

Ah I haven't heard ornery since I was a kid. I miss it. Now that I'm an adult people just call me a sarcastic asshole.
I feel sorry for all you newbies who became bag holders on PLTR. It was hyped up on WSB and other social media sites but the price didn't justify the revenues.

If you didn't get out on Friday, place a sell order on Monday and don't look back.
It was only a matter of time

This is the amount of money to where you don't yolo shit on low probability options buying.

Sell cash secured puts on AMZN 4 weeks out.  Guaranteed $8,000 a month.   You've got enough cash to literally have a complete second income selling Options.

I see the bull case for EV in general but this one looks half baked. A solo commuter even without a global pandemic is a tough sell. Sparrow tried back in 2010‚Äôs. The higher end solo models are 50k and 125k.

Yes but they illiquid as shit. Prob calls on car
Since none of you idiots can be fucked to check, let me help you out. 

Palantir will report their Q4 2020 earnings on 2/4/21. 

If the information in this article is correct the lock-up ends about 3 days after that. But 2/7/21 is a Sunday, so probably Monday 2/8.

TL;DR lockup should end 2/8/21 or thereabouts.
1. Can be seen as an upside Ie; no need for onsite storage space, servers, costly start up PACS systems costs etc. 2. A standard ultrasound could be hours away (on call technologist) even in a big city not all hospitals have 24 hour ultrasound staffing. An immediate okay scan by and okay operator will more than suffice when time is of the essence ie the emergency department.
This strategy went well for everyone that went cash gang right before the elections (NOT!!!)
Should be some stimulustalksgoingwell well news in the morning too
Wait can I still sell my calls in lockup period
That looks like a cesspool of covid transmission. Also no fucking chance only two employees had covid

I found out about it on r/pennystocks when I started trading in June. It was $5.40 when I got in, sold at like $7 lol, of course the DD was there, people were saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a long term hold‚Äù, and they would get poked fun at with the usual ‚Äúdont be a bag holder, it‚Äôs a Chinese scam blah blah blah‚Äù. All the information is here in WSB, you can literally make thousands here, just be judicious about choosing your stock

Is it if people can‚Äôt afford to buy things?
Wouldn't put money on it. They only did the Tegra to Intel conversion not too long ago. The integration runs deep with secure boot, firmware signing, fusing etc. Not easy to rip and replace with AMD. Most of infotainment etc is just Linux but everything that happens before Linux boots is a big deal in a TSLA.
Parties are nuts. Imagine being Eisenhower and overseeing one of the largest public works projects in history (Interstate Highway System), the creation of NASA, expansion of Social Security, increased funding for education, and support for the minimum wage and public housing programs.

Yeah as someone pointed out, you could either go up the Mississippi and through Chicago (there another river and canal) or the two ways I mentioned. The interior waterways in this country are pretty nuts (same is true for Europe also).

Potentially yea, but it would have to drop a lot to lose money if depending on how you play it. Eg bought corsair at 35, sold a 30c against it. Basically banking on getting assigned, but getting to keep the theta from a high IV stock. It‚Äôs not much, but it would have to drop 15-20% in one day for you to actually lose money. Basically a ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù single day trade that lets you get out by the end of the weekend because your hoping it gets assigned.

well the difference between paying the IRS and the Market is that the market will provide returns eventually. if youre so risk adverse that you struggle to believe this, then its likely you wont find yourself even in this situation lol

Well...see it‚Äôs legal to have it in the airport. It‚Äôs illegal to have it on the plane. 

But the only way you get caught having weed on the plane is if A) people witness you using, and B) people smell it. So basically edibles pass the bar on that because your not smoking or vaping flower. Essentially, edibles pass through the same as all packaged food

Comment on the NYT article:   


**Butterfly‚Äôs basic business plan of uploading patient data to their own cloud platform, without any way to keep a copy in the local medical record and without any sort of business associates agreement with the hospital in which the device is being used is problematic in the United States.  My impression is that they believe that they can create a consumer ultrasound device that requires no tech, no radiologist and no clinical judgement by collecting and analyzing ultrasound images collected using their platform.  I think that goal is admirable, but In the meantime,  they are creating a massive trove of personal health data that is being used for much more than the immediate diagnostic need without permission of the patient and without making it visible in the rest of the medical record.**

i promise it hasn't, king. leg down or no, buy contracts that are over 100 dte and otm and in the reopen sector ie: ba, ko, luv. Lots of analysts with price targets closing in on S&P 4000. if FAANG just gets back to their ath's then we'll get 3850. the cyclicals that have been beaten down - if they recover to their previous ath as well then we have 4000. Everyone thinks this happens before eoy. The real show starts in january if trump refuses to leave. no leg down until then

and if you are really bearish on america, NIO and BABA calls. theres always a bull market somewhere...

For real, I don't get how the FIRE subs talk about always maxing 401k and Roth (that's 26k a year!!). That'd reduce our YOLO money to 0 for most of us, plus play with this calc to see, how far 16 years of saving the max gets you

Nio sells a decent amount of expensive ass EV's..
Also the glassdoor employee reviews are decent and theres quite a few authentic reviews In there talking about inside information. Tesla being added to #spy500 is a massive win for ev companies and nios second behind Tesla in actual production of electric cars.

Started off with about $85k but added to it as I can. I have a high salary so a lot of that is contributions from my salary rather than investment gains so far.

However this isn't the bulk of my networth which is unfortunately in my mortgage right now because I didn't really think things through. Got emotional about property, bought property. It's nice but ties up huge amount of money because I had to front 30% of a $1M home as a deposit.

I consider these funds my retirement funds which is why I don't really make YOLO plays. That said, half my portfolio is in BABA dip right now: https://imgur.com/KzhvY0g so my risk tolerance might be higher than yours.

However I make ~200k/yr salary and I'm 29 soon so my risk tolerance for these funds is much higher than most probably.
Basically I see it like this, if I can risk a bit and get to 3-4M over the next few years then I can retire and just keep trading.
Gotta think Travel stocks/casinos are gonna bomb again, So many went to ATHs on vaccine news, no incentive to hold with all this risk.

you correctly assessed my ballsack, and for that reason I'm in.
I don't think we'll see spy drop below 350, maybe 348 ish, anytime too soon. Every day a 'contested election' looks less likely, vaccine news will keep trickling out until FDA approval next month, and stimulus likely on its way (maybe).
I agree that there will be a crash some day. Prob with puts is that the vast majority will lose money, trying to time the market.

What is your reasoning? If you don‚Äôt have a reason it‚Äôs probably best to sit out unless your 9k is play money. You‚Äôre trying to invest in high IV plays.      

Disclosure: I am long on JMIA, but I only bought it because the options were too expensive and buying 300 stock was the same price as buying 10 options dated for December. 1/3 the gains for 90% less risk.
I've been lurking here long enough to realize the masters ways
In a rational market yea, but the last two weeks were vaccine pumps just because their vaccine were announced 95% effective. You don‚Äôt think another pump could happen based on them ACTUALLY applying for emergency use?

About the Chinese vs western sentiment, It‚Äôs not quite like that. Jack Ma looked like a fool next to musk in China last year.  Alibaba is a majority investor in Xpeng. This is a personal beef between Ma and Elon.

This guy confused me like crazy .
Craps is actually one of the casino games with best odds since the pay close to the real odds. You just have to know how to play and bet behind the line. Also, some shooters can control the dice quite well. I used to go play and there would be this old guy who would consistently roll 10-12√ó before a 7. Just pull out on like roll 8-9
No higher than 515 plz I sold 500s against my shares with that as BE

I mean with something like palantir or Corsair. Sell a call when it jumps up, buy it back when it dips. If it doesn‚Äôt dip then just let it get assigned. Def don‚Äôt do it with TSLA that thing is scary if you theta gang.

Posted a bunch of links yesterday. Honestly I feel like NIO weeklies are the play til year end at least. If banks are all raising targets and the median price is $305.65, rally won‚Äôt be over for a while. I‚Äôm going in on more weeklies and leaps tomorrow. Call it FOMO if you‚Äôd like, but a family member bought 1k shares at $3.50 and I‚Äôm pissed they‚Äôre better at this than me lol.

Dec 18 itm options were up 300% between monday and Fri of this last week. I don't expect to see that again, but with a dip this week i think calls as near as jan would be fine.
thanks for the info. but....whats the difference between the two? in your example you start with 300k gains. if SPY ends up dropping and you sell at a loss, you just cut into that 300k gain you started with. so either way you are losing $. the difference is just who it goes to (IRS or back in the market). i guess the best outcome is if SPY is higher than you can keep the shares.
Just get one 11,000% gain you fkn retard

I've watched plenty of videos and read stuff on it, but I just wasn't sure on this point because some have described option exercising as just a buy and sell. Also, you can sell puts without owning the stock, so I wasn't sure if you could do sort of the inverse with calls.
Yes the parties re-align every now and then.  LBJ as a Democrat supporting the civil rights act did a lot to cause the current re-alignment.
Yep that‚Äôs what I bought. And 50 1/21/22 calls with $50 strike  It weirdly didn‚Äôt put a space between the lines. Formatting on my iPhone...

This sounds like the best plan
Short term perspective- there‚Äôs still room to go up in certain areas and make solid returns.
Long term - You are more likely to make 0 to negative returns when picking and choosing individual companies. Best bet is passive indexes or hold cash.

I get the vibe that Investors aren‚Äôt looking at long term prospects at these prices. They are looking and will continue to look for quick wins until there‚Äôs a catalyst driving markets definitively lower. Probably will be a liquidity based event.
Lol no

You actually gets taxes twice . First you pay the capital gains tax from your profit. Then your profit before the capital gains tax was deducted is again added to your annual income so that will also balloon your income and you go up higher the tax bracket so you pay greater percentage

I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs priced in. Palantir has plenty of space to grow because it‚Äôs gonna be a major part of the military industrial complex. Palantir is willing to take AI contracts that Google isn‚Äôt (ie deportations and AI software for targeting suspects in drone footage). Military industrial complex just eats up taxpayer dollars regardless of market conditions. In terms of the commercial side, closest competitor is Alteryx. Just look at their stock and it will be a good guide for what Palantir will look like in the future. Also, Palantir is ahead of the competition in terms of creating analytics software that has built in compliance with GDPR and privacy regulations.

It will rise. Low market cap, gaming sector is one of the best right now. I also like the fact that it has a low float (only 17M shares).
EUA getting approved, that and Trump concession both should be large pumps.  As will be whatever day they start administering vaccines etc.  Once all of those processes start market will run on hopium for awhile.
why is it bad to trade those ?

So let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm cash gang....

I‚Äôve never been more confused which way this market is heading. Seems like all bad news is priced in with vaccines but also feels like we could have another sharp selloff ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Thoughts?
You get the option premium + difference between the price of the stock and strike price if it‚Äôs excercised. Only cons of doing this is that you are stuck holding those shares until those options expire unless you have enough collateral on the side.
Not when it has a 40 billion market cap.
BABA yes. Rest of market? Unsure yet.
We might get vaccine pump or we might see big tech breakout and QQQ to the moon.
No fucking clue yet.

why is it people believe PLTR will drop after covid restrictions ease? Wouldn't that make them go up, since domestic teorrist groups can gather again (10 or more people) without being in danger of being obvious? fyi, half real, half joke.

" Palantir even sued the US Army in 2016 to force it to consider using its intelligence software after the Army chose to go with its own. Palantir [won the suit](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-prevails-in-lawsuit-over-u-s-army-contracting-practices-1477940218), and then it won an [$800 million contract](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/palantir-wins-competition-to-build-army-intelligence-system/2019/03/26/c6d62bf0-3927-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html). " what the fuck? 

" Despite its high valuation and lucrative contracts, however, Palantir‚Äôs financial documents show the company has never made a profit, with a net loss of about $580 million in 2018 and 2019 and nearly $165 million in the first half of 2020. Those numbers are trending in the right direction, though the company admitted in the filing, ‚Äú\[W\]e expect our operating expenses to increase, and we may not become profitable in the future‚Äù and ‚Äúwe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.‚Äù "

Let me know what you‚Äôre buying this week so I can do the exact opposite.
A relatively safe play at the end of the week for minimum risk but minimum returns if you cash but itching to do something, is to buy 100 shares of a stock you like and sell slightly ITM covered weekly calls against it. Just make sure the remaining premium is worth more than intrinsic value.

Yeah very true but as a company shifting into more and paying off that Aetna debt I can see them climbing back up some. Nothing feels better than making a profit off boomers money
all good then! leaps. And occasional weeklies.
Exactly
Leap contracts only expire on leap years

Yeah, the philips were nice but just not sturdy enough feeling to be trusted to firefighters and medics though. 2 other ones were very much made for FFs to throw around and were pretty phenomenal. I know they were both awaiting approval still but would imagine done by now . One I think anyone would love, built into a pelican type case, with case in case design filled with foam, supposedly good drop and crush ratings, and lies tilted to 45ish upright on open for easy viewing, plop on chest and get views while able to see hands also. US main built into box, holds 2 probes, 6x4x2ish or so for easy carry, fits in cargo pockets no problem. Of course I don't have any of the names though, so can't even find it by looking thru the EMSWorld exhibitioner yet. 
As for wireless, absolutely. Gotta admit the wireless stethoscope is pretty damn awesome in the field when used with earbuds, beats out my cardiology 3 in almost all situations. Wish we could have wireless monitoring box for vitals, but I know that would be lost every other day of the week by crews. I'm kinda curious if bluetooth has enough capacity to be delayfree enough for US though? I'm imagining so but dunno.

What if your country doesn't require you to pay taxes? I heard many middle east countries don't have any taxes.
i dont think i'm clearly explaining it here. 

say i have $300k of realized capital gains this year, I owe $150k of this to the IRS come april. 

if I turn around and buy $300k of SPY today, come december 31st I have two options:

if SPY is higher than $355, I keep the shares, come jan 1st I realize the capital gains in 2021 and those count towards my 2021 capital gains. if on dec 31st, if SPY is much lower, then I sell the shares and realize the loss, effectively reducing my tax burden for 2020. the same day I turn around and buy AAPL which is basically SPY (or VOO if youre especially risk adverse). 

Its called capital loss harvesting and any tax professional will recommend this... setting aside money for taxes is a horrible strategy unless youre a multimillionaire.

But also making bank on covid tests and in a few months (hopefully) they will literally lead the nation in making a killing on covid vaccines. They are already prepped and pushing for technicians to be able to vaccinate to try to get every damn arm there is to stick.

Huya is definitely a good choice. Especially now that tencent merged Huya and Doyu to create a monopoly in game streaming. Huya is like twitch (makes money through gifting streamers and ads). IQiyi is like netflix so I wouldn't say Huya competes with IQ. IQ's competitors are Tencent Video and Alibaba's Youku.

The vast majority of people will not be getting a vaccine anytime soon. There's even a logistic issue with delivery of vaccines to boot. Winter is playing out exactly like Fauci said it would, too, with each new passing day worse than the day before. The states are calling for more lockdowns, not the Fed. Without stimulus it's anyone's guess. If Biden can get bipartisan agreement on a stimulus I would expect stocks to continue to rise otherwise I would expect a bear market. Lockdowns won't help but we know the market is overvalued and removed from reality today.

I promise that's not true unless his wife makes a shit load of money.

Minimum wage in CA is $13 for an employer like McDonald's. There are 2,080 working hours in a year for a full time employee. Your friend will be subject to FICA taxes at 7.85% and some other small taxes making up another 1% or so. His income tax bracket is likely 10-12% federal with 2% state.

He's making at least $27,040 Gross with a minimum net of around $21,456. PLUS he's likely eligible for EITC which will refund pretty much all tax he paid in.

Source: I was a minimum wage worker in CA for a long time and still saved a nest egg of around $50k by 19. I'm now a tax accountant.

Yeah what he said. Promoting is much better word choice. I didnt want to say "selling" because of its connotation nor pumping as I believe it's rise is more than justified. 

I don't want to miss out on the chance it gets the 10% pump post ER that qc0m, er!c and even c!sco received. OP is right, the LEAPS aren't worth risking paying higher premium for if it catches fire but im only buying half next week.

Im subscribed to it. Most of their original shows are targeted towards young people & moms (chinese themed romcoms, dramas, & variety shows) because that's what gets them the most views. They also have a lot of chinese movies, their anime selection is sparse, and they don't have much foreign content. I personally don't watch that stuff, but I do watch is their murder mysteries dramas. Their award winning shows are murder mysteries so it shows that IQ has the capability of producing quality content.

The only thing that concerns me is the time it would take to sell the contracts back. I‚Äôve never had for than 20 at a time and my strat for it involves a min 100 contracts. The DD on the front page is for 1200. Sounds like a good play in theory but I don‚Äôt understand where all the buyers are for that many contracts.

Fun fact!  I used to sell cell phones to the Stratton boys, and Jordan threw me outta the main (and only huuuge) trading room while he was reviewing the day and giving marching orders to the troops.   

"Who the fuckkkk are you?"

"He's the cell phone guy"

"You can't be in here right now, get the FUCK out" --- "And after I'm done talking you can sell as many phones as you want"




(Thanks leo dicaprio, and fuck you too!)

I waited in the hallway ... and sold a lot of phones that day!

Btw the parking lot was SICK!   I mean fukkin sikkkkk.   Ferrari, Dodge Viper, Lambo, Rolls Royce, every supercar you could think of.    About 20-25 of them in the front row.    All the other peeps drove regular cars.  I guess they were working their way up to the front row parking spot!

Nope, just authoritarian government. They locked down Wuhan by sending in the military to enforce noone left their homes, welded doors shut on apartment complexes and delivered rations to everyone.

You could never do that in a Western country.

Also they have no requirement for tourism so no need to allow anyone else in so once virus was eliminated locally there isn't a means for it to be re-introduced.

And that isn't mentioning the fact they control all the factories tha tmake all the PPE required to administer care safely and prevent transmission.

There are lots of reasons China in particular was able to shut down the virus spread but in Asia more generally it mostly just comes down to culture. People just wear mask and lockdown rules are followed closely.

Yes they probably lied about their numbers but at the same time they literally arrested people for not staying home, welded their doors shut, and doing extreme things cause theyre China. Meanwhile people in USA holding protests against masks. Also when this all started  our ‚Äúleader‚Äù was saying the corona was something the Democrats made up to scare people and that it was a hoax
Look into some spacs before they merge when they are in 10-10.30 range and ride the momentum when merger news or any news comes around and sell. They typically hold around 10 without any catalysts. Or dump it all into MAXR.
Almost certainly above $300, -maybe- above $320 ATH but we will see. Fair value is much more than that but china stocks always in the fucking bargain bin.

In addition to what that guy said you need to check what your broker's policy says they will do as far a exercising. 

Mine will exercise if the call expires ITM (in the money) and I have the funds to exercise it in my account. If I don't have funds to support exercising then they sell the option something like 15 minutes before close.

This is for a cash account, no margin.

Yes. Those leveraged certificates are not good for long term holding. Over time volatility will eat it away even if you guess the direction correctly. About the holdings, NIO and Tesla have had a good run but VW, BMW, etc. are ramping up electric cars production.

Keep the shares and sell the options.

You know what maybe shares is the way. Thanks brother
I think it could hit it sooner. The low float can squeeze HARD and with increasing pressure it could go parabolic for a bit. Normally that would be suppressed by the large investors selling but I dont think they have a large enough stake yet to do that (and those that do probably don't want to sell)

Why on earth would you set a stop loss for 3 dollars on a $259 stock? Especially BABA! That should be a long hold and weather the 1% loss. If you can't afford that, your shouldn't be investing.

Invest in your education so you can get a real salary that you can use to buy stonks.

If you aren't tarded consider programming or another trade that isn't gated on expensive college education and has high return on investment.

Otherwise if you feel like you will never have a job that makes real money get that shit into index fund like VUG and just keep adding to it.

But for real, invest in yourself first. Making money with money is a lot easier when you have a stack of it first.

You think they use the weekends to Etchy-Sketch the market graphs or do they do it live?
Hmm 30k is fine here but that also has to do with low costs of living.
I missed the video sorry. That‚Äôs fucking stupid haha. 

You do seem to like the market to do a lot of things and I guess I can sympathize with that from an American point of view. It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt think that college costs are only like two thousand a year here because of the market. It‚Äôs because the government pays a big share.
Do you think colleges would get cheaper if you let it go? Or just more exclusive? And who benefits? 
I indeed just now realized I‚Äôm having this discussion on wallstreetbets hahaha I thought it was some random life pro tips page or something sorry:D
Retail target price is $30. They did a spilt just right now before ipo to bring it down to $30 for those who are lucky enough to get in first

Not that it matters much, but IQ just completed an internal investigation recently and found no wrong doing, and like OP said, IQ also stated that they are still working closely with SEC to clear their name. Also, the fraud accuser (Wolfpack research) is no longer shorting IQ, they announced on TV that they covered their short shortly after they released their fraud report. Which kinda says that the fraud accusation was likely just a plan to make a quick profit from the panic and dip.
My bad bro, 11/27s you‚Äôre right about next year lol
basically this. Was going to wiat a month before I considered it. Then I thought no, too much of their growth strategy rests on increased use from China. No thanks.
Does anyone here speak autistic? What is this lad trying to say?
Ok, I‚Äôm not well read on the Malheur Wildlife Refuge situation, but from my understanding it was in direct response to the government illegally seizing private land from a rancher in Nevada. So to call one a peaceful protest ‚Äúsummer of love‚Äù and another a domestic terror incident is just intellectually dishonest. And again, to my knowledge, people were shot and murdered in CHAZ, and this other thing ended peacefully with the people being arrested. I‚Äôm just looking for intellectual honesty overall. So many people change the rules for their side while making an argument and it bothers me
Please set a 6month reminder on this conversation. I‚Äôll be taking the other side of your TSLA bet.

Ok thanks
Nothing coming if that is what you are asking.
As for what could do that?
Any one of:

1) Clarity from BABA execs on their evaluation of how either of the new draft regulations will affect core business + ANT and intention to work with regulators.

2) Scaling down or downplaying of the anti-trust or fintech regulations by CCP officials (hugely unlikely)

3) Jack Ma apologising for criticising banking regulation in China and committing to work with regulators to shape better fintech regs.


However the most likely case is no news which should send BABA to ~$290 this week or so and $300 will follow soon after. Reaching $320 may not happen this year but we will see.
The stock market has become a popularity contest

This is what the retards from /r/investing fail to understand

One interesting thing is that Steve Cohen, president and secretary, and Peter Theil, director, together cashed out around 30M shares between Oct-Nov.

Most major players have announced results. Basically it depends on whether they have their shit together for delivery announcements which is a huge shot in the dark. The success rate is high but doesn't mean they're confident enough to deliver to market, or have delivery means, or have coordinated with Mango for the army rollout if that is real or not. Burry's CVS play implies to me he's banking on that being the biggest distribution method and I think that will take time to implement and roll out. But everyone wants it fast. Definitely at the latest before end of December there will be a plan in place.

Do you think TSLA will be worth more than AAPL soon? Because if so your absolute best case scenario is you might 4x your money if Elon takes over the world. Your downside risk is easily over 50% at this point. The odds/risk reward are so insanely against you in the near term. Everyone gets the TSLA hype, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs trading at a 1000 p/e. You‚Äôre in a bubble, and a pre requisite for a bubble is a convincing narrative. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap that because it makes so much sense to you it‚Äôs not a bubble. ALL BUBBLES MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY, else they would never get off the ground. 

It‚Äôs mental gymnastics.

Are my AAPL 122.5 calls exp 1/15 fucked?
Nah I sold it. If something else happened to the house I wouldn't have been able to fix it. The money I made off the house went straight into the market and has made me a lot of money.

I'm not scared of right wing militias bro. But there is an objective difference between protests that turn into Riots and sending death threats, plotting to kidnap and kill a duly elected State Official.


One is premeditated domestic terrorism. And the other is a heated and overwhelming confrontation of two differing opinions.

Top 1% only makes 400k annually.
I still don‚Äôt think people really get it. TSLA isn‚Äôt in manufacturing any more than AAPL is. Imagine if we had to discount all revenue for AAPL outside of its phone and tablet sales. TSLA is making these cars that are technologically The equivalent of an iPhone in the Nokia brick era, and their production costs are decreasing while their capacity is ramping. I am fine with people disagreeing, but I am one of the people who still views it as cheap based on long term (3-4 years) valuation and I have almost all my money where my mouth is, so if I am wrong at least you get the validation of knowing I lost a ton of money.

The thing is the only justification is that others are betting on it right now. Much like nikola it is trading off of hopes and dreams right now.

Seeking Alpha has a good article about this.

Basically the lock up ending will have downward pressure on the price. 

But the greater number of shares floating allows for institutions to buy more without affecting the price compared to buying now.

He's expecting the price to drop a little 1 week either side of the lockup expiry date but to recover after that 2 week period.

I agree we might see a few terrorists get in from foreign countries. Right wing militias and sovereign citizens are a bigger threat according to analysis from our own intelligence agencies. Syrian Kurds destroyed Isis for us. The leader of al qaeda, Ayman al Zawahiri, is rumored to have died from natural causes recently. Israelis killed al qaeda second in command very recently, and this was just after the Afghan military killed a high ranking al qaeda member in a Taliban stronghold. Radical Islamic terrorists are a threat for sure, but homegrown right wing terrorists are the bigger threat right now.

So if the price freezes today, according to projections they‚Äôll have a p/e of 120 if they reach the high end of their estimates for next year?

Consider the tech companies ahead of Tesla that already have established service revenue sit around 30 EPS. You might think well sure, it makes sense because they‚Äôre already sort of topped out on their growth curve, but Tesla is right behind them as the 9th largest company, so TSLA is already in that echelon of market cap. Basically either TSLA‚Äôs market cap is going to be the largest in the world this time next year, or more likely it‚Äôll stagnate, or even more likely we‚Äôll see it come down to a more realistic multiple for a top 10 company which at this point is literally a tenth of where it is now.

Very few people on WSB execute their contracts. Almost all are selling their calls after they increase in value.

At the end of the day the CEO calls the shots. Thiel also didn‚Äôt support Trump‚Äôs reelection bid.
BRrRrRRrrrrrriiIng it!
1. It's been months since last time Trump attended any of the meetings related to corona. Usually it was Pence sitting there.

2. Asshole destroyed CDC right before it would have been useful to actually have a functioning CDC.

3. See number 2 to understand why the orange asswipe is directly responsible for at least some % of deaths that could have been prevented.

4. Blowing dogwistle for anti vaccination, anti mask wearing groups and organizing rallies and parties that directly helped to infect people including himself.

5. Preventing  a peaceful and organized transition of power which will also delay the mass vaccination efforts.

Anyway he lost so deal with it.
That is the easy way. Starting with zero is much more difficult

let the bard tell his tale
I‚Äôm not an expert on Germany‚Äôs tax laws my any means, I‚Äôm just citing information from a former employers employee info page (they send lot of people to work in Germany). That‚Äôs all fine and dandy, but you can see in the video I linked that Biden wants to tax ALL capital gains at 40%. Also not shown is him saying he will do away with the tax cuts for capital losses as well. I have no problem paying my fair share in taxes, but we just have a difference in philosophy about what that entails, which is normal and fine. I don‚Äôt believe I should be forced at threat of prison time to pay for someone else‚Äôs college/healthcare. Should we reform American health care? Absolutely, we need price transparency, that would bring down costs immensely. Should we reform college costs? Maybe, but in my opinion the current system doesn‚Äôt allow for capitalism to lower costs because the government stepped in and took over all student loans. Not only did that raise the cost of tuition in America exponentially, it automatically eliminated competitive college tuition rates and thus student choice because colleges get paid instantly from the government. I guess we want different lifestyles, because 30k is a very very meager living in my opinion, and I would assume you agree as well or you wouldn‚Äôt be here trying to invest your money to make more money.
I think the only way I can get my account to 1 million is by starting with 2 million.
Better to do something like 10k 10 times, but I agree with the overall sentiment.
Western capitalism has pulled countless millions out of poverty worldwide. Our global quality of life is better than it's ever been. Not saying it's perfect, but some perspective is needed before criticism.
Logic and common sense?

Blasphemy!

Since I started doing options earlier in the year I went from 30k -> 42k, then came crashing down to 2k after the Softbank fiasco. I was thinking of giving up on options but figured I'd try one last yolo on TSLA. Up to 8k now. I'll be happy if I can just get my initial investment back.
I dreamt of WSB and stonks.

Am I a retard?

If you treat it like a tech company their multiple is only accounting for projected future EPS a couple years out based only on their car income. Do you not agree? Or do you think they should be at a PE or less than like 10? Consensus estimates on 2021 earnings go as high as above $4 EPS which would put them at a forward of 125. Almost universally projected income is a decent amount higher than that for even 2022. None of the estimates are currently accounting for an explosion in solar or any subscription self driving income.

I think so, you can see that already happening to some extend already. If you're not in some STEM field you're essentially already left behind in high tech areas around the world. And as you say, once automation and AI really kick in, I think it will worsen the divide, because high income service sectors  and blue collar wage earners will get whipped out, further concentrating wealth. The biggest unknown to me will be if the exponential technological advancement can sustain itself and at some point human beings will be so hopelessly inferior that their existence will be 100% at the behest of technology. Maybe this is how it's suppose to go, maybe this always was natures way at preserving equilibrium.

They also have just released new Occulus and are moving into cloud gaming in a big way. No one currently has conquered the cloud gaming market and I think FB has a good shot given their huge user base.

Dump out of tech toward the rest of the market will start in the 2-3 trading days of the year. It's when TLH ends and people start buying up the stuff they harvested.
Some morning brown?
If the price was reflecting the cars being priced in, then it would have a value no more than other already established car companies. 

It is already being valued like a tech company, hence why it has a valuation as high or higher than other tech companies as the 9th largest company already. 

TSLA priced in the car side of the business a long time ago, that should be obvious in the market cap relative to other car manufactures.

I think it will be green no matter who takes office at this point. I do think though the market is going to slide down at some point. Trump has already started putting Chinese companies on a no invest list. I think if he takes office, that list gets deeper and tech starts hurting really bad. I also see trump creating a huge trade war to destroy their economy and I think the market will start to bleed.

But isn‚Äôt that only the top scale that is taxed 42%? Where I live the scale for anything under 18k (you can live off that) is 0% then everything over that is 21% I believe and so on upwards to almost 50% but the first 20 to 30k is not very expensive at all. Who needs to make more than that anyway? And bear in mind that this is income tax right? So it‚Äôs after business costs and you can always keep cashflows inside your company for buffers and growth and whatever you want.

I do, part of that is asking retards why they think retarded things.
post this on r/WritingPrompts
116 comments, all based on hopium and tricking people in buying a shitty stock.

PLTR doesn't even share a screenshot of their application. No, they say they have a "platform". There might be substance, but it's invisible. 

Is there anyone who can explain what their product does in a *technical* fashion, because I have seen literally *nothing* that isn't straight up buzz words. If you would tell me, that there isn't actually a company, and that it's just a landing page, I wouldn't be surprised at all. 

Take their "Gotham Platform", which says "Integrate, manage, secure, and analyze all of your enterprise data.". Google Cloud/Amazon also offers that for the right price. 

https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/modules/ is also just one big list of jokes. 

You would have to be a complete tool to buy into such a platform. Buying stock would make you a complete retard. Buying options on how many retards are going to buy it can work, but how long do you think it will take for the rest of the world to figure out PLTR is worth approximately nothing?

When you look at what their "platform" is based on, it's literally the same shit the rest of the industry uses, and sometimes even the worse parts at that. You can read that on their blog, which could have been written by a software engineer with a year of experience. 

The *only* way PLTR is ever worth anything is due to corruption. In a free market, PLTR is worth *nothing*.
What is this, r/investing?
Idiots who play weeklies will. None of the PLTR DD (ive done it myself too) implies short term, we're all in it long. 

You're confusing your bubbles. PLTR isn't an EV hopium play.

2021 ITM TLT calls make a lot of sense rn. You get to leverage your way to a 40% bond exposure with a lot less cash. You can bail with minimal loss because it never gaps down.

You wake, coughing. The light is dim, like it is most winter mornings, but you can still see the shape of things. Things you don‚Äôt recognize.

‚ÄúHere, have this.‚Äù You feel a metallic weight on your arm. You look down to see a woman you don‚Äôt know, pressing a warm Coors Light against your bicep. She smiles, and you notice she‚Äôs missing a tooth. Or three.

Her smile fades as you start to cry. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna pay me, right?‚Äù She stands up, and what you see in the near-darkness should not be seen. Ugly isn‚Äôt a fair word for it...she‚Äôs *weathered*. The ugly is beaten and bruised.

She repeats, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to pay me, right!?‚Äù She chants this, between chugs of the beer she offered you. A dying voice in your mind wonders if you can pay for hookers with margin. Why not? It let you buy uglier things than this.
NIO? Just googled EV back in 2018 (after I test drove my friend‚Äôs Tesla) stocks other than Tesla (cuz at the time I though they were to expensive lol) and followed the rabbit hole till I stumbled upon NIO. Did the same thing with NVDA back in 2016 and I‚Äôm up >700% on those.

Yeah Netflix posted their lowest numbers in like fucking forever in Q3 at 2.2 million added, granted after record breaking numbers because the pandemic. IQ investing heavy in content and I think are due for some uppies.
A CC is neutral, not slightly bullish, but overall I agree. It depends on the strike price relative to the stock price.

It just proves my point though. Why is the entire thread full of PLTR pumping if the people pumping it don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs going up soon and are just selling calls to everyone else here before it crashes

Everyone who bought calls is trying to sell them too. And the people who bought shares. Hence -8.66% intraday on Friday while the daily thread was all desperate pump

You should note that if this was made in 2020, you still have until Dec 31st 2020 before that taxable amount is calculated. If he loses it all before Dec 31st, he owes zero taxes.

I'm buying calls on Kohl's at Open. They did something ingenious to capture some market share in the gaming world and more importantly increasing their retail market share.

PS5 is sold out everywhere. Kohl's ingeniously gets social media, particularly Twitter talking about how PS5 can be bought on their website. Swams of people go to Kohl's website and successfully buy. These same people get $180 Kohl's cash for their PS5 purchase. And they are non-stop talking about this $180.

As of right now, many PS5 orders are canceled by Kohl's. But these people get to keep the $180 in Kohl's cash. The backlash is minimized while increasing Kohl's footprint. Customer acquisition in full swing atm

Yes. You can make a diagnosis with pocus. But often times it's not that clear. The ultrasonographer isn't the diagnostician either. The images are sent to the Radiologist who is an MD or DO that specializes in imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, Sono, etc.) ED docs are most commonly doing the "eFAST" POCUS in the case of trauma. Looks at both lungs, quick view of heart, liver, spleen and bladder. That is to make quick determination of certain interventions needed immediately. Overtaking in commonality the "eFAST" is POCUS guided IV placement. Fam Practice docs using them mainly in the context of obstetrics. You'll do fine with the butterfly as an investment. Not a bad investment. They're the first movers and it's a slick device. One of my friends bought one.

In all seriousness, the timeline also plays a role I would guess. Typical education timeline is in the range of Bachor‚Äôs-Med school-Residency = 11-13 years post-high school. With average debt levels in the 200k+ range, by the time we can actually save for retirement, most are in their mid to late 30‚Äôs. You end up with people who think they need to be more aggressive with their investments, and have to at least somewhat believe they‚Äôre smarter than other people, with a healthy dose of good old fashioned autism

I think the move here is probably to buy Moderna Calls when it dips after PFE approval.  There will be a lot of press about PFE distribution.  The narrative will switch to Moderna and they will be the one to mass distribute.   If Moderna falls around low $80 after PFE approval, it would be a good time to jump in on June 2021 calls. There will be too much huff and puff in January, going out further would be a good idea.

it actually is. investing you winnings after a huge win is the best use of your money, especially if theyre short term capital gains. my taxes in CA in the highest bracket come to 38% fed + 12% CA... so 50% i have to give in april. Buying shares with that is relatively lower risk since half of it is tax money anyways

It Goes up up up regardless
Okay wait, I think you actually need to know this if you‚Äôre selling premium. 

A CC isn‚Äôt bearish, because you have to hold the underlying in stock. A CC is slightly bullish, and you must be fine either holding, or letting go of your shares. 

Depending who you talk to, the best case scenario would be to sell a (for example) 18.50 call, and have it expire worthless with the stock at 18.49, retaining your shares.

This strategy could potentially be ‚Äúshort term bearish‚Äù if you were holding something like SPY for your entire life and decided to sell a CC a week that you expect it to certainly go down, but that would only be to offset losses during that decline.

This is irrelevant though because I don‚Äôt hold low cap stocks for life.
Should have tsla bro. MSFT just sits at 200
Get cozy folks. Nothing to see here until the 15th üëÄ
**BEAR CASE FOR BUTTERFLY**

&#x200B;

Well first, I really think that this is a disruptive technology. It is easy and more importantly simple enough for an amish to hook up to their smart phone. The biggest upside is the cost--at $2000 a piece, this is probably one of the cheapest device (if not the cheapest) in the market. Gates is invested which is a positive sign. However, does the technology carry enough potential for this to be a multibagger? I don't know but I will be a devil's advocate. 

&#x200B;

**Potential Competition**

This is not the only portable device in market. Here are some of the portable devices that can be hooked up to a smartphone.

* GE Healthcare Vscan--most commonly used by hospitals. Cost is steep though at $8,000
* PulseNmore At-Home Tele-Ultrasound for pregnant women
* Babywatcher for pregnant women

**TAM**

Total addressable market per investor presentation is 40 million worldwide. That includes 12M   doctors and 28M nurses. The phrase to remember here is worldwide and not US. Of the 40, they are aiming to reach out to 3M doctors and 5M nurses (more on this later). Therefore, unless they pivot from their original idea of supplying the device to med professionals, their market is limited. In addition, rate of increment of medical professionals in the TAM would be no more than 5%. They probably realize this and therefore introduced a recurring revenue stream to address this issue. They offer four options at this time-

* Option 1- One user license and lifetime membership for $2,999 which offers unlimited cloud storage.
* Option 2- License for up to 5 users at $1200/year. Cost of device (2k) is separate.
* Option 3 - Enterprise license which I believe is on a case basis but essentially for larger teams that use multiple devices (think 10+) in the hospital.

Should be clear by now that the potential for revenue growth are in hospitals that will qualify as enterprise customers. However, are those hospitals willing to give up on incumbent GE's devices and replace those with Butterfly? I don't know. Also, GE does not charge a recurring fees so hospital admins who make those decisions will be clearly looking to avoid recurring expenses.

&#x200B;

**REVENUE GROWTH BIG IF**

This is the biggest factor when deciding to invest in a company. They have not published any data on revenue growth for the past 2-3 years, although they have boldly suggested a growth of at least 60% until 2024 when they predict they will break even and revenue will slow down significantly. There is no data to support that revenue growth will indeed be upwards of 60% from here on, specially when they do not provide what the growth has been for the past 2 years. Bear in mind that this device has been in the market for 3 years now. 

For the purposes of comparison, Inari Medical has grown their revenues at >100% for the past 2 years. Thus, market gave a premium for Inari's stock. Dexcom grew at >100% back in the days so the market traded it at a higher premium. Livongo was growing at >100% revenue for the past 2-3 years before they went public. 

Thus, unless Butterfly shows the rate at which they have grown the revenue in the past 2 years, they are flawed in assuming that the revenue will cloak in at north of 60% for the next 2-3 years. 

&#x200B;

**BUSINESS MODEL**

Retards on here will mention that this can be used by anyone including vets and farmers. However, think of this for a minute. Farmers already operate marginally. They do not have the money to buy an instrument like this. They would rather prefer paying a premium for insurance that covers the health of their livestock. As for the veterinarians, I am not sure again. These folks typically buy an instrument which has high upfront cost but comes with high reliability and unlimited storage. Would they prefer that or the mobility of instrument? IDK but it can be hard to change that mindset.

&#x200B;

**CLOSING REMARKS AND WHY I AM OUT**

1. Unless they reveal their revenue growth for the past 2 years, the merger appears to be an exercise to raise cash because VCs have cut short their funds.
2. Founder/owner has a history of founding 5-6 companies, selling them for a profit, and exiting quick. As an investor, that is the last thing I want. I want a founder who can run the company forever (also the reason I am invested in Shop, TSLA, SE, SQ, etc).
3. They need to pivot from their original business model. Identify a larger market which can be addressed and identify a large problem that this can help solve. Currently, Butterfly is suggesting that the instrument is for use by medical professionals only and technically, if the margins on this instrument are not higher, it will be harder for them to make it a cash cow. Further, they will have to integrate a # of functionalities that a traditional ultrasound monitor can offer so that a case can be made to interested parties.

This is ridiculous. All that CDC order did was delay the inevitable and allow people to dig themselves into deeper holes. Yes I feel for the renters but what about the owner who has to still pay the lender? We all know the homeowner* is going to eat the ENTIRE bill (which thanks to the government, continues to grow) yet we sob for the renter. Meanwhile there are tons of companies hiring right now: Amazon, Target, Costco, Kroger, Unilever, Facebook , Phillips, GSK, Wells Fargo, UnitedHealthGroup, Spectrum, Anheuser-Busch and more.

For the month of October, there were approximately 638,000 job openings. In terms of the unemployment rate, the rate had dropped to 6.9% back in the month of September. Due to the rise in the job market, this provides a bit of hope for the nation and the economy.

It may be bad for the housing market short term but we can‚Äôt let millions of people live rent free for an unspecified amount of time. Hell if I was a renter, knowing I could get away with this, I would sit on my ass and live rent free for as long as the government would let me. This gives them no incentive to try. Meanwhile no entrepreneurs will ever want to buy rental properties or invest in real estate again - the government is removing the incentive on both sides of the house (pun intended)

Not going to lie this is a fairly large unknown but with how little inventory there is, coupled with the growing economy and enormous demand for housing (especially sub 200k houses, which the majority of these rental homes are) there are tons of pre approved buyers and accredited renters willing to step in. 

Might just provide a good buying opportunity. Don‚Äôt let this event convince you to short RKT, like covid convinced a bunch of idiots to short SAVE at $10.

It might be a little dif cuz i guess paypal is buyimg up coins like crazy so there is a shortage, hence price going up more. But, can u determine if mara was up the same exact time as bcoin? Or was it lagged behind? Im pretty stupid, but i think if mara is getting better at mining and more profitable in gemeral, along w coin prices up, i think its just a matter of time until mara ath.

You‚Äôre the one asking, I‚Äôm just giving opinion that putting in TSLA might have a higher risk than putting in AAPL. Of course the upside is high as well in TSLA.. but you do you
how about some HBI as well
Should probably just get in now lock up ends after Q4 earning report
Are we really gonna melt up from here? So many are bearish which makes me think yes, but valuations are so fucked..
Every Monday baby right one schedule
NP. I'll go looking for some sources. I do so much reading during the week that I don't keep track anymore unless it's a stock I'm currently holding. If I convince you, will you help me set up some plays?
I was with you until you used the term ‚Äúneckbeard.‚Äù
I think its actually really risky at this point to pull user data. With all the concerns about data privacy these days, if there's more restrictive laws, that'll impact companies who deal with user data. More reason to long PLTR over SNOW.
The change to ARVL is not till early next year. I would count on a significant dip before then.

Good thing no one is talking about JMIA in here

And we‚Äôve already seen it move 100+ points with 100% of the float, I agree it‚Äôs ridiculous, but so is the current valuation. It‚Äôs one thing to play with fire but another to play with a wild fire

They both have negative delta and are thus bearish strategies.

LGVW is a SPAC. That means it's a publicly traded company that literally only has money. And it looks for a promising privately held company to buy just so that private company becomes a public company immediatly. And then with that merger is usually a name change to reflect the buy.
I‚Äôm saying if you owe the IRS 50k in four months, that money should be set aside and not go anywhere near the stock market. I know this is a gambling sub but it‚Äôs not worth risking your business because you gambled away part of your tax payment.
So historically what happens turkey week? Do most people stop trading wed and ignore the short day Friday?

I don't get what you are trying to say. You pay taxes on net profit for the year. By re-investing with profits in the short term, you aren't risking anything additional other than losing your gains. Just gotta be careful with wash sale rules.

Your story isn't wrong but I thought you had sources to back up your claim that demand is falling. Demand for EVs is rising and with it, Tesla's demand will naturally increase. If there is some data to back up your claim, I'm happy to look at it.

Pretty much this. Imagine if AMZN also owned big stake in TSLA and also owned PYPL and that would still not be as big as it really is.

Oh and it's in a market 3-4x the size of the US domestic market and isn't about to go through recession because of fucking up virus handling.

The premium paid is added to the basis. So i exercised the call at $45 but my basis was a little higher, like 46, because i paid for the call

What happens to your premiums when your exercise a call?
They revamped their entire business model and got new CEO. The changes they made turned the entire company around. Early 2021 they will be debt free and turning a major profit. Last year at this time they were swimming in debt and occurring major losses per quarter. Not the same company now.

Lol what? You know anything about contracting? 8.3 million is minuscule.  I‚Äôm sold on them, but not for this
I dont know. It was a disturbance in the force that told me
Where it matters: China. TSLA's unexpectedly strong earnings in 2020 that lifted it so much, and its forward growth prospects, are in the China markets. It was positioned to dominate there by default. Now everyone from BMW & China's own startups are moving into that EV space, so it's getting really crowded really quickly.

All these retail traders with their life savings in TSLA are going to get crushed.
Thanks for the pump
For like the 100th time, I never said 250k wasn't a big windfall.  I just was agreeing with the guy before me that 250k wasn't going to buy you a big house free + clear, and mentioned that if someone thought that was the case they likely aren't aware of the other aspects of home ownership.
Nah it takes way longer for me to lose 2k at the slots
Oh I sell theta all the time. The point isn‚Äôt that you couldn‚Äôt have sold a CC, the point is you‚Äôre still ignoring that the stock is crashing right now in direct contradiction of what you‚Äôve been saying. That‚Äôs the denial part I keep emphasizing

Now you want to act like you made money anyway which, regardless of whether it‚Äôs true, is irrelevant.

Clearly buying puts would have money too. It‚Äôs the same directional delta as selling covered calls and you would have made even more money. But then you‚Äôd have to admit the stock was crashing lol

You don‚Äôt sell covered calls if you‚Äôre bullish
really nice and fuck you!
TSLA bullish gang wya?
Wonder how many people don‚Äôt realize buying weeklies that we have a day and half less of trading this week.
If you‚Äôre already in PLTR congrats it will be gapped up Monday don‚Äôt be retarded sell that shit. If you‚Äôre planning on FOMO and buying in Monday after it‚Äôs gapped up please really go for it and stick the whole account in. Make sure to document the process and don‚Äôt worry about a little pullback diamond hands baby it‚Äôll go back up.

So you‚Äôre saying he gave out handies behind the dumpster for his fortune? Hmmm maybe my life does have potential then, Wendy‚Äôs here I come!
Me too. My 1/21 call is down 1,200
Look at what happened to AAPL in March...
Because demand fell below production in Q3. Prices aren't just dependent on costs of production. They're also determined by buyers' willingness to pay for your product. I don't think TSLA is going to be able to hold onto the market share it has over the next 4 years. When the auto majors in the US start moving EVs and owning an EV is more than just an affectation car for cool-ish tech players, then he's going to get shut out on price/quality/features.

So let‚Äôs review

1. You claim the stock isn‚Äôt crashing right now

2. I point out I called it going down Friday and it went down 8.66% peak to trough intraday and barely recovered any of it by the end. In other words, it *is* crashing right now

3. This underscores my original point that it sounds like you‚Äôre in denial

4. You respond by saying ‚Äúwelcome to the market‚Äù and insisting you made money anyway üòÇ

Went pigeon hunting under this bridge by my house yesterday. Its more like a freeway underpass actually, but same thing. Always packed with cars so I get weird looks when I do it. I wear my homemade pigeon costume so they think I'm one of them. King Pigeon if you will. I run around flapping my wings, hooting and making pigeon calls. After about 3 to 5 hours they fully respect me as their ruler. They start circling me on the ground. Hundreds of them, and this is when I make my move. I do a huge flap of my cardboard wings, followed by a brutal body slam. Takes out anywhere from 10 to 20 pigeons. Best I ever did was 35. At this point I'm covered in blood and guts but I don't let it go to waste. I scoop them all into a bucket and take them home. Food for the whole week now. What kind of data could PLTR get from that??

CIIC is the SPAC set to merge with Arrival, which looks to be totally legit. They've set up full scale manufacturing facilities, and people who have toured them are impressed. EV buses and vans could be especially big in Europe, and they're the best set up to produce in volume.
Hey guys found this really promising lowkey play for this week. Ticker is PLTR company is called Plantir call them up and they will send someone out to your house and plant anything you want trees, shrubs, flowers.

I know webull is also a free similar one to RH. 

But literally just do some searches. You wont find anything identical. it is what it is. There are far worse ones. I know New Zealand is stuck with just common stock share. No options at all loool.
CDC warned against Thanksgiving travel and LUV still gained a percent between when that was issued and the end of the day.

Elon has said in the past that any reduction in cost of manufacturing will be reflected in the price. Battery day has shown us the cuts to cost that we can expect over the next 2 years. What makes you think that the cuts are due to reduced demand?
How do people allow this to happen lol
Wait until one-two weeks out from the end of December and buy puts on a green day
you can just sell the calls when you want to cash out.

most options never get exercised, even if they're ITM.  they eventually get bought back by option writers.
Tomorrow will be big green.

Then you‚Äôre a smart man my friend. Real estate can be very lucrative or even just a great side tool to make your life easier a bit now, and lots in the long run. A lot of people get to caught up in appearances to be able to take a second to think if maybe buying a duplex or triplex would be a better option then finally shelling out on a million dollar home. That multi unit property should pay for itself, and eventually they‚Äôll be able to pass on that appreciating, and passive income generating, property that‚Äôs paid off to their children, and make their lives even MORE easier :)

Been holding Daimler and Nvidia since 2016 and right now Im pretty much even considering dividends (with Daimler, up bigly on NVDA). There's momentum in the Daimler stock that I havent seen before and I think their partnership with Nvidia is good. Tesla investors are so god damn retarded they think they invented the wheel and that Tesla is miles ahead in self driving cars while its not actually the case. Nvidia has been working on self driving cars for years now. Daimler has the fleet and Nvidia the brain, they will be putting out very competitive vehicles. When it comes to AI there's no company I would trust more than Nvidia, they're pretty much all in on AI and Daimler is gonna benefit from that. But it's gonna take a few years for that to materialize so I dont know how one would take advantage of that here and now with options. I dont see why Daimler would take off any further right now because they heavily rely on the economy not to be dogshit and the economy doesnt look too hot right now.

Sure. OP mentioned the positives of the company so I thought I'd also add a potential risk.
It would certainly be good feedstock for edibles or vape pens. I've been in the extraction industry, in one way or another, for a decade and have seen acetate pop up on occasion and tried plenty of it.

You might have different experiences with acetate than me, but all of the comparison claims between D9 and acetate fell flat for me. The hydrogenated THC was interesting(HHCA?), and I like D8 or D9/D8 blends for vaping.

But if a cartel made huge amounts of bulk crude, distilled it en masse, then made Acetate to go into edibles and drinkables...I imagine they could stay in the game.

Sounds like you are getting on the right path bro.

I struggle with depression even when I know logically I have no reason to feel down. The important thing is to identify this is a problem and work on what you can to alleviate it. For me that is forcing myself to do the things I know will lift my spirits each day.

Acknowledge it's there, work on it and life will be better. Can't promise the depression will go away but that doesn't mean you can't live a good life regardless.

Best of luck man.
What‚Äôs the model, do they mail them to you? Will you distribute prepaid mailers or something? Or will there be deposit locations? I feel like if you get some of these choices wrong the biz will never have a chance
The only one I could find is interactive brokers and they require hella cash to be able to do options
Not if the CCP has anything to say about it. I'm waiting for that shit to cool off.
You mean the stock that fell from $19.66 to $18 after I warned people to get out on Friday? Yep about 8.5% intraday loss

I think EVs will come down in value soon when more already established car manufacturers take it seriously.

Will be a while but I expect the car market to balance eventually

Are my over leveraged positions okay next week?
100% agree. But we're in a retarted market where pfizer cures a worldwide oandemic and their stock goes down. Nvidia has a record breaking quarter and their stock goes down. Nio has a shit business and its skyrocketing. Perfect environment for a crash long but short its tendie town
Then maybe AAPL, it can‚Äôt really go down as much.. TSLA can be unpredictable
See the other comments in the thread. Their data center growth potential and recent numbers plus the potential for a company to buy MRVL
Thanks!

There is, but it had a hell of a run last week and volume on the buying peaked Thursday. I would personally like it to pull back for a minute if I was gonna buy more. If you want shares you could DCA

If you‚Äôre actually wondering what it does. It‚Äôs basically just antibodies from the 10 or so most prevalent illnesses always found in the body. So that your body temporarily won‚Äôt have to fight them and can focus on covid in your body. It kind of forces your body to focus on just the one disease for a moment. So it‚Äôs not really a vaccine so much as a temporary vaccine against every disease except covid, in the hopes that that makes it easier to fight covid
Buying 1 options contract controls 100 shares, so you are looking at needing like $1800+ to exercise your option if it‚Äôs ITM and buy those 100 shares. You can still buy options contracts and make good money if it hits. 

Buy shares if you are fine with slow gains, buy leaps if you want to make a little more gain with a little more risk

Reminds me a little of our housing market bubble 2008, where they built houses in my neighborhood like crazy until the crash, and that then sat empty and half finished until 2016ish. It was my professors take though so I don‚Äôt really have the ammo to debate the point like he does lol.

This is a serious concern imo, in 2017 something like 20% of people in Nigeria had an address where they could receive mail

 Nigeria is doing the same thing the Ivory Coast did, 3 word digital addresses

https://www.guardian.ng/news/nigeria-adopts-new-addressing-system-nipost-sets-2020-target/

> A document from the Ministry of Communications yesterday said Nigeria‚Äôs current poor addressing system means that only 20 per cent of her inhabitants receive mail at home. It revealed that 79 per cent of homes and businesses cannot receive deliveries while the remaining one per cent receives mails using one of the 478,000 post office boxes nationwide.

Sideways and maybe a little up would be my guess. If trump concedes, green af. The possibility of social unrest will keep some in cash until January. 

Also tech exploded up already so if you‚Äôre looking at more immediate gains I‚Äôd look outside of tech. Market usually leads economic recovery by two quarters

Yeah, that article is fairly accurate. And at this point even a couple years old. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, China is fucked up. Cities built this way without the character that comes from time and organic demand are really unappealing to someone from a US major city. And you‚Äôll still see whole shopping malls in major cities that look like they just don‚Äôt need to exist. But that‚Äôs a bit superficial of a take too, as there is upward mobility for poor Chinese people and they dont give a fuck that some other city is moreüî• by American standards.

Lessons learned from last week:

1) Don't buy weekly calls if you aren't willing to gamble away that money. 
2) Subsequently, buying long calls weeks away is a safer, more smarter bet where you have time to get yourself out of a sticky situation and possibly even make a profit. 
3) Don't invest in Meme stocks like PLTR, especially not at the tail end of its market value vs its actual revenues.
4) Mango is now like a nasty Ex-girlfriend who has a court order to move out of your house in 2 months.... It's going to be a loooooong 2 months.

Yep me too. It‚Äôs not a Tesla and it increased way too quickly. This really isn‚Äôt a stock you want to buy options with IMO. Leaps maybe but I‚Äôd just be holding long On this. I‚Äôm 60% up on my leaps but this may be the best it is gonna get with the lockout period ending in March 2021. I‚Äôm getting greedy.

You think the people trying to pump it...... have a short interest?

How in gods name did you make that one make sense in your head?
I don't think it will go bankrupt. Also, it has pulled back from recent 15 dollar highs. I do think it has good potential. And I sell covered call options from time to time to hedge a little bit if it declines in the near future.
Europoors use  etoro
That‚Äôs not true at all. It specifically stated there were multiple crimes committed but they would not elect to prosecute. You cannot prosecute a sitting president. There‚Äôs also double Jeopardy and pardoning power to consider- so you can‚Äôt make a swing right now anyways because if you get obstructed and lose he can‚Äôt be charged again and if you succeed and he‚Äôs pardoned you can‚Äôt charge again. 

If you want an honest take on the Russia investigation you‚Äôll have to wait until the DOJ is no longer under Barr/trumps control. Then the barrage of federal and state charges will roll out. 

Lastly: the mueller investigation is generating a return on investment for the government. Should more asset forfeitures occur as it continues, the return should be worth posting as a gain shot on here. Just give it time and use your nogin brodie.

The Fed is getting quicker at absolving unpaid debt.  We‚Äôll get a news release within two weeks saying the Fed has printed 1.5T to bail out the banks again.  And all that money that was supposed to go back into the fed just ends up in either circulation (hyperinflation) or continues to feed the asset bubble.  I‚Äôd like to see the Fed stand up and say they aren‚Äôt bailing anyone out the next time around.  Is that fair after the precedent they‚Äôve set?  I don‚Äôt see it crashing unless they have the balls to keep raising rates on the incumbent that is ok with the market tanking on their watch.

If you're holding for taxes maybe just buy stock as those won't expire worthless. You could even buy stock like NIO to hold until then and probably profit well.. or just throw it on way out of the money calls on a meme stock expiring next week and triple that investment
Never know for sure, but if it does anything like TGT last week...I'm in
Just because it expires next year, doesn't make it a LEAP.

Not sure about the US.

In the UK, if I'm not mistaken, you can deduct commissions and other trade related costs.

Regarding donations, I think that may be possible however you'd have to check with an accountant (or online) since trading options is subject to CGT tax and not income tax, but to me personally it seems that you can.

Took a quick look, IVR doesn't look "due to recover" to me. They got hammered in March, losing the vast majority of their book value selling assets to meet margin calls as the market tanked. They might be safe and profitable (no idea, but not confident) but they're just not worth what they used to be worth.
Hell yeah haha. I wanted to do it so bad but I hadn‚Äôt been trading all week and felt like any trade I would‚Äôve made was fomo. I fucking put $200 in gild puts just to get my feet wet, thinking the WHO news would bring it down a little bit but it went sideways all day. Guhhhh.

Hahah that describes it perfectly.
Since vaccine news came out there's been a good amount of rebalancing away from tech giants and into things like retail. QQQ isn't a tech fund but it's heavily weighted towards tech giants so while it hasn't been crushed lately, both the S&P 500 and the market as a whole have beaten it for the past few months. 

Good chance that continues but QQQ is a great fund. Prob best to stick your money there now and not stress about any short-term variance.

You do know a lot of the Asian countries never went into lockdown right? Even in places like Thailand they were able to lockdown only locally since they contain (fur to tracing) effectively. Vietnam and S. Korea had terrible experiences with SARS which, thankfully, force them to create all protocols a priori so that they would be proactive rather than reactive. Blanket lockdowns are a last resource to buy you time to setup your medical and public health systems, they are not the most effective tool to manage an ID. So if you already have those systems setup you‚Äôre kind of a step ahead and hopefully you don‚Äôt mismanage it

A little off topic here, but out of curiosity, how does/would billing work if a non-radiologist MD acquires POCUS images and has a radiologist read them? I imagine billing would be the same as if a radiology tech acquired the images and had a radiologist read them (as is standard). Perhaps there's a small bump in reimbursement for having two MDs (non-rad and a rad MD) read the images?

Reason I ask is because widespread use of routine POCUS will depend largely on reimbursement. Learning to use it requires an investment in time/effort that may not be worthwhile without appropriate reimbursement.

Overall, agree, POCUS's role in healthcare will continue to expand. This is a long hold.
Ahh I thought it's related to a specific event

Not going to lie, quite the learning curve. But I was also coming into stock trading with no fucking clue how options worked, ETFs, CFDs etc. So I had to learn that shit at the same time.

With that said and done the web interface and mobile app are pretty easy to use.

TWS, their desktop app though is really hard to use but very powerful and provides features you just can't get elsewhere.
If you want to get into advanced stuff like option spreads it has features for building spreads in the UI itself which is pretty nuts.
They have a full set of videos that will teach you how to use it and also about trading in general but definitely not for faint of heart, stick to web/mobile unless you have a lot of time to spend learning it.

Valuation is a little retarded. The problem is you need some type of a catalyst to correct it. Vaccine took about 25% off, but that‚Äôs all on speculation, which can just as easily swing the other way. You need something like a disappointing earnings report to show the growth honeymoon is over. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs happening until reopening, if ever given how many employees are going to want to stay remote.

I'm thinking of putting all of my savings into stocks. So I just don't want to fuck up and invest at the peak.
Alex, what is shot term correlation between similar stonks?
look at some point when all the remaining cash goes into already inflated assets, there is going to be a liquidity crisis because of over-leverage and because all the excess liquidity that has been built up since the financial crisis will have to be removed, and no one will supposedly see it coming, just like during the GFC. Markets were very liquid as long as valuations of CDOs kept up with the euphoria, until one day they were toxic assets. What will be the CDOs of this bubble? That is the multi-million dollar question

oh yeah and the FED is not omnipotent, their effect on markets is mainly psychological so they won't save the markets when we have a real crisis
I panic sold OSTK at $16 in May.  Never again will I be a pussy

I love the Rhino.  There may be cheaper places but if you are just going to have a ‚Äústrip club experience‚Äù I would recommend it.  If you‚Äôre looking for lower cost or other ‚Äúservices‚Äù there are better options.  I‚Äôve have never come out of the Rhino when it wasn‚Äôt daylight outside.  They say you lose track of time in the casinos, but that applies to Vegas strip clubs as well.

Market tends to price in events like these using simple stats. Most projections assume gains within one standard deviation of whatever model/estimation is being used. This presents a great opportunity to make (or loose) big $$ if the numbers are way outside estimations. This year is incredibly difficult to predict so there‚Äôs a greater likelihood that the insane drops or jumps will happen. There have been many earnings posting at 2 standard deviations or more which seems to shift predictive model evaluations and is fueling these bizarre market moves around ER‚Äôs. It‚Äôs also encouraging MM‚Äôs to get out of stonks around earnings more than usual to avoid unquantifiable risk.
It would've been way worse if it wasn't but yes it was

Come on, maybe Singapore, Japan, SK and Taiwan but you think places like Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam had their shit together?  We‚Äôre talking about poverty-stricken countries where everyone packs in buses together.  You couldn‚Äôt lock down those countries because the governments have no money to give people to let them stay home.  I don‚Äôt think you can blanket all SE asian countries like that, they‚Äôre vastly different economically.

It's a UX sort of thing. It's hard enough to make older medics figure out a duty cell phone that is different from their personal. To require one to use their personal cell on calls with COVID/Blood/Generalgrosspeoplestuff is a quick way to have to be replacing personal cell phones on the regular. Not saying ANYTHING bad about the product, it was freaking sweet to play with, it's just the logistics of rolling these out on a company wide level. Makes looking at dedicated units a more feasible thing when they're rolling out units at 1500-2000 or less. Potential is good but I think the market is about to be completely overwhelmed by handheld units so it won't be quite so rocket shippy.

I‚Äôm shocked at the behavior of these lazy Americans. They need to pull themselves up by the bootstraps and get a job!

You need to get out of your own head. You have to love yourself fully and honestly, and be comfortable in your own skin.

If you come off as on edge or nervous others detect that too. Women enjoy feeling comfortable and are attracted to it. Ignore the money thing when it comes to women. I literally don't have any money to my name but that's never stopped me in my escapades.

I'd suggest a gym habit and a good dose of psychedelics with a trusted guide as a way to start resetting your ego and self-image. Be proud of who you are.
Nokia is am undervalued company with a roughly 30% market share of 5g networks world wide. 5g is just now becoming mainstream and will continue the next decade, their goal is to become the leaders in this field.

What is immediately clear is that you‚Äôre a douche knuckle.
By have to I mean forced to. It's higher risk going super deep OTM. If you gotta count on something mooning by 35% it's easy to run out of time or for a temporary dip in the market to fuck you over. Closer strikes are gonna pay more consistently if things don't work out ideally.

If that's how you play it then do it. I been better off recently with buying slightly OTM moves.
Ppl need to manage their risk better and adjust their expectations. If you couldn‚Äôt make money of TSLA lottos last week, you might actually be mentally handicapped.

People really have no other place to put their money, huh?  Can‚Äôt sit in cash because it‚Äôs being diluted.  If we don‚Äôt get stim, we‚Äôll just print off the student debt bubble.  Why do we pay federal taxes at all?  The money won‚Äôt end up in circulation, it will just add to the trickle up economics of company profits and sit in the pockets of shareholders.  Just drip feed the poor and have it all sucked up by the elite that own the things the poor need to live on.  The fed doesn‚Äôt dare raise rates, which keeps this asset inflation on a continual path up.  Why would it pop?  Where does the money go from sold shares?  Fiat that keeps getting diluted?  TINA.  How do you turn off the tap after this many bailouts?  Are you telling me that my debt to repay is somehow different?  We‚Äôre on a path to wealth inequality the likes of us have never seen.

Nah too logical. Anyone that was going to sell at 500 sold at 500 already. If the price holds 490+ at premarket tomorrow it‚Äôs going to break 500 before markets open and hold, then it will get pushed from all of us dumping in OTM calls. It will be 550+ by weeks end.
Same reasons why nvda crushed expectations last week but didn't moon imo
This is blatantly a pump and dump. No DD, does not have a position yet, almost no volume or open interest on the contracts. Very legit!
Their tweets are pathetic, who takes them seriously?

Compare a statement from JP Morgan and to one of their tweets with a fkin hamster üêπ

So basically, Reddit.
It's the point in the season where my worthless Falcons win a bunch of worthless games after they've been eliminated from playoff contention just to fuck up our draft status.  So your Saints are doomed.

Gooood morning. Feeling veeeery good about my BABA calls
Same bro, same

I'm expecting at least 50% on Monday, will set a stop loss and hopefully ride it up
You guys see the lines at the food bank in Dallas üëÄ guess all those people forgot they still had plenty of money in their pockets
Not just any retards: WSB retards
People here seem bullish on Biden and the stimulus he‚Äôll be trying to pump through congress, but seem to have already forgotten about the Democrat War Machine.  Leaps on LMT and RTX baby!!!
Thank you so much for the advice!!
PLTR was the best one by far
Short $hsy to zero IMO
You sure woke up with a bad attitude.
Riot is a retarded way to play shitcoin and im not convinced that RIOT/ MARA pumpers are not ü§ñ or shills. Change my mind
It pumped?
Working on my wife‚Äôs immigration and prepping for the in-person interview with USCIS. They wanna see my Robinhood account....Also how do I explain away her boyfriend in these photos?
Yeah but I'm not talking about Palantir... I'm talking about these crappy EV companies
Damn won't dimes do
Lol bro I'm not trying to be an asshole but it already happened. ETSY is only 10% below ATH. ZM be mooning. WFH been up huge Thurs/Fri
But the S&P is where growth stocks go to die.
I got 500 on it
Only think here that is not that risky is SRAC. I have never seen a spac trade below 9$ for more than 2 days. So potential downturn 20% while  if the launch is successful who knows. The sky is not the limit haha. I went for it because the risk reward kinda pays off. Tesla nio sbe.... idk looks like a pump and dumb. Who knwos mby the pump will last trough out december l. Mby even longer
Good morning sir

If you plan on going to one of the clubs take one of the cards from those bimbos outside the casinos. They will usually have a deal where you can get a free ride and 2 drinks with your cover charge if you use their limo service. Plan to Uber back tho, they promised us a ride back but never came. I'd bring at least $200. Drinks are expensive, and the club we went to it was $20 for a lapdance on the floor. A private one was $100+. Really strip clubs in Vegas aren't worth it. I've had more fun for less money in my hometown many times. ‚úåÔ∏è

Yup üëç! the fucked up part is all it takes for one game on your ticket to not go your way and the whole thing is worthless. 
Let‚Äôs say you had 
The browns, Steelers, chiefs, falcons all to win but the falcons lost. Then the whole ticket becomes worthless. 

Do some reading for sure bro. Get on bovada and play around with the betting odds and potential winnings.

The crappy part about bovada also is that you can only withdraw with shitcoin or shitcoin cash üò≠
You're a money printer it's insane. So much respect honestly. I'd be happy to make even 100 weekly

Are you kidding me that started last monday. If you didnt get your positions in on TDOC PTON CHWY SHOP you done fucked up
For options it takes like 4 business days for funds to clear...pain in the ass. You probably can't trade til Friday
I bought 12 shares on Friday EOD... hoping for a BOP!
Yeap, I had 42k in sept and yoloing 100% , when you get it goes up a lot but again when you are left at a top it sucks! I am stuck on 24 now and using only like 5/6 k for day trade, you can make 500/600 easy or when u start loosing just cut it before 300$! Its slow but at least you are protecting your money! Last week I had 4 decent trades and 3 fuked up one that I cut early, still 1.1k up, not bad for me! Also my baba leaps did grate!
Very true
It‚Äôs actually quite simple. The SE Asians countries had the protocols and experience from SARS. Also African countries where Ebola was rampant have done quite well bc their testing and tracing systems were already in place
the Pfizer approval is expected to happen around dec 8th - dec 10th and distribution starting 24hrs later, this is known. I don't think this news will pump tomorrow, but when the actual approval happens and distribution starts, I expect one because it will be a psychological barrier lifted
Gotcha thnx
I‚Äôm not taking part in that trade. I don‚Äôt trust it or believe in it.
!remind us all when he gets assraped
Already priced in broooo
Ah that makes sense. So you can basically create a ticket that says "the Falcons will win and the browns will win," and you'll profit more if they both win (vs betting on them separately).

Makes sense.


Damn I'm gonna do some reading this week and bet on next week I think. Thanks bro.
Gooooood morning baba gang!

I think PLTR could even end up out of business but the retards here will still buy it if it does.
They get mesmerized by the lotto winners and will get what most lottery players end up with.
I don‚Äôt think, I know. Don‚Äôt waste your time trying to convince me in your reply bc this is the last thing I will say to your post. An electrician who trades stocks and did a job for pltr during the same time it‚Äôs being pumped and the odds of you finding wsb to disclose this ‚Äútop secret‚Äù job you did in the uk. üëã
I have a feeling we get hit with a pump every Monday until Donny is gone. He wants that shit to crash only after he leaves. Maybe stimulus going well announcement.
opening a tdameritrade account today.. how long will it take for my deposit to go through
Standard pump and dump mate. But yeah, any DD could have told tards to stay away.
I said all of that in an edit, but I guess you hadn't seen it yet.
That‚Äôs what everyone said about 2020
Well with Mnuchin pulling the $600b from the Fed he sort of put the Dems in a tough spot. If they refuse to reappropriate the already available funds to small businesses and hospitals then they look really bad. It‚Äôs not enough to give to states.
No idea fam. I have an iPhone and mostly use safari

ZM has already started its return to the premier Covid play.
Yeah but that doesn't matter to an options seller.

As long as it doesn't hit the strike, he keeps his tendies.
You had me at the first 4 letters
Wow you actually did some math to come up with your numbers. 

For that reason, I‚Äôm in.
Pelosi went go big or go home on something that needed compromise. Why not start with industries that R Fuk and then move onto more if it doesn't work?
If you have to buy deep OTM calls then you can't afford options on that stock
Playing spectacularly retarded is one of the ways to get spectacularly rich.
What‚Äôs the purpose of buying already itm though? All that intrinsic value is built in. Is it just for the delta?
I think most of that is just for the memes.
Vast majority here seem to make decent plays but shitpost about FDs all the time and then the new tards actually go and do that shit and get zeroed out.

I would say I feel sorry for them but that would be a lie, loss porn makes me hard.
Why?

Just asking since i haven‚Äôt looked at the  sub in depth yet
420.69
Calls or stand back and enjoy the show.
I can‚Äôt do margins and shit. Points spreads are confusing as hell and really unpredictable. I typically bet on the money line. Basically who‚Äôs going to win. When you add multiple money lines on one ticket it‚Äôs called a parlay and those amplify the amount of money you can potentially win because of more risk.
I‚Äôll buy that one too for sure.
Why didn't you just do verticle spreads and up the contract amount? 

It would lock in profit, lessen the premium, and eliminate theta decay.
Week or so
I approve this message on behalf of all europeans

dude buy RIOT calls and profit on the run-up in shitcoins, then dump. As more dumbasses believe in them they are going to surge
honestly great analogy
Puts 2 years out
Wow where to start 
Ravens - couldn‚Äôt stop a mediocre Patriots rushing attack, face the best RB in a run happy offense today and missing best defensive tackle

Browns - look at their defense stats without Garrett.. awful, he‚Äôs out

Pats - 50/50

Saints - taysom hill sucks

Steelers - yes
I had to sell one of my 45C 12/4s to buy dip elsewhere. I'll probably regret it

just dont lose your lunch and shirt money in long positions ok

I bet this sub would cut its losses by at least half and double its profits if everyone here switched from deeeeep OTM calls to ATM or ITM. 

Seeing a lot of people that are right directionally lose a shit ton of money because the options they‚Äôre buying are spectacularly ret√§rded.
üòÇ why are you so desperate
Lol I'm buying calls 11/24 I don't know how I can lose. Shit can't go tits up.
I got a big old Greek god body and one of those little tiny statue pps to go with it üò§
Right, that makes sense. Thanks for the info, it‚Äôs got me thinkin (of the obvious lol).
 This claim about SPY is disputed
Woah there buddy don‚Äôt get too crazy now
lmao same here. Bought around IPO and it wasn't moving anywhere except down & flat. So I noped out of it for a small loss.
When do we think market gets the message Covid19 isn't cancelled and rotation out of cyclicals and back into tech starts?
this is big brain moves thank you i will do this
Day trade with only 25% of your portfolio, never more! I started doing that 2 weeks ago and actually works fine!
Vaxx pumps are the new stimmy talks. Each one will have diminishing returns until widespread vaccination is completely priced in.
Got a real hankering for some TSLA 800C
Tbh I never really looked into it, but it seems sorta confusing.

Do you just do straight "XXX to win" bets, or do you do those crazy bets where you try to predict win margins and shit?
I deeply resonate with this
My 364,365 and 367 calls approve this message.
Robinhood 0dtes are gonna ruin some folks
Just go to a brothel bud.
lol We get beaten by market (like Citron reporting on NIO, etc..) but we still hold those calls regardless to collect the sweet tendies.
I think it‚Äôll hit $400 this year before cooling down to $380
That‚Äôs for a larger stimulus. I‚Äôm talking about the $600b that Mnuchin is getting back from the Fed and recommending that they reappropriate to more PPP loans

Real talk, the Falcons MO is to suck ass until they statistically knock themselves out of the playoffs, then suddenly become a giant killer that beats the best teams in the NFL for no reason. They do it every year.

I think Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales could be a catalyst for a move in either direction as well. I'm suspecting the sales will be surprisingly good because of pent-up demand from white collar workers working from home, but if those numbers are bad, it could drive the market down a couple points

If you're an atlanta sports fan, you're used to getting rekt. We dont just lose, they rip our hearts out
Exactly.
I hear ya. I was super into it for a long time and trained a bunch of people in college. People who came in overweight (not obese) always had the best best results going straight to bulking. I‚Äôd put them through easy 3x10 3x15 reps and do a lot of different lifts with bike riding for the first couple of weeks. Then we would start transition to heavier lifts 3x8 4x6 5x5 over weeks time. The guys who did this and 1/2 way ate clean with lots of protein always blew up. It‚Äôs awesome how excited people get when they start seeing muscle definition and getting stronger. After 3-4 months we start back towards lighter weight more reps and lots of cardio. 

Nobody who is out of shape over weight and weak wants to come run on a treadmill and starve themselves to look soft and skinny. Much easier transition if you start new guys on a bulking/ strength cycle. Ask any bodybuilder which they prefer lol. Those guys live to workout and look jacked and they hate cutting. Newbies want no part of it or give up. Build muscle first then tone up to show it off.
Great

Good luck

Well imagine if gamestop coupled their ecommerce platform and wide array of stores together with pickup and same day delivery while expanding their sortiments to everything gaming. They could sell games, consoles, PC's and PC parts, LED gaming chairs seats, digital exclusives, physical exclusives, trending accessories, ... all the while having a great online marketing division focusing on game reviews via YouTube, Twitch etc... like all the things that made chewy win against Amazon.

Specialization.

I can see the potential Cohen does, even in an age of ecommerce gamestop could be a superior niche shop in an expanding sector. This is the first time we could have 3 generations consume video games regularly.

I tend to prefer warrants over equity or options for SPACs. I held DEACW and FMCIW before their respective mergers with DraftKings and Tattooed Chef and it paid out graciously. The pros of the warrants is you have much less of an up front cost to buy into the stock in the future. The con is that when warrants are redeemed, the company must issue new shares which increases public float = shareholder dilution. This differers from options because option writers have to buy any shares not owned from the open market to then sell to the option holder. Keep an eye on the amount of warrants sold by a SPAC

The contact is cheaper but it has nothing to do with delta. In fact this wouldn't matter at all since selling a contact on shares or things that represent shares are separate events; PMCC is not a "multi-leg" strategy. That would be a calendar spread. 

Regarding the IV again that's relative to the short and long but the long itself can have high IV (see: NIO, TSLA, et al) so while the IV is lower for the short than the long the vega is far worse for the long than the short (sensitivity to change relative to volatility) meaning that you are actually long vega here and this is not short volatility.

Long leaps react more to volatility which is why they're not used in short-term plays. It isn't that they can't be but rather that they wouldn't be optimal in a MM window or IV crush would do them far worse die to vegas nature and the multiplicative stance.

TL:DR: PMCC is fine but don't take it for more than what it is. Keep it simple. Depending on length of time it is likely not as profitable even with reduced startup costs.
At least spell the ticker right goddam

You belong here with that tard name.try again 2024 knob job.
Actually we don't have inflation right now... world is headed towards QE to try stem bleeding from Covid which is inherently deflationary (which is why equities are skyrocketing). The goal is to get to inflation but it's going to be a while before that can happen with everything going on right now.

I don't pretend to understand why shitecoin is mooning because I don't consider it an investment vehicle and my goal is to make money and not gamble (yes, I know I'm in a casino full of tards).

Electrical capacity. The infra to a normal gas station is to run some lights and a few pumps, not to hypercharge papa Elon's $TSLA rocketship. It's not necessarily economically viable to make that capacity available in the locations that existing gas stations occupy.

True but in practice most people that start exercising late are doing it because they need to lose weight. It‚Äôs a pity while they lose that weight to not try to maintain as much muscle as possible. And when someone is new and overweight, having him overeat is not really a great idea. So they need to lose weight. In my opinion they should be losing the weight slowly rather than cut fast with a lot of under eating and cardio that will melt any muscle. 

Remember, most of these people are not regular gym goers going through phases. They need something that will improve them the best way and can be then maintained without too much trouble. Telling someone who has been overeating all his life to cut sharply and then to start bulking up and cut again is too drastic and dangerous (especially losing control during bulking period and not being able to go back into cutting). 

I‚Äôm not talking about the theoretical best, I‚Äôm trying to see into practicality for average Joe (Biden)

Nah its not that much. I got into the options a little late (only at 3.75). the dec 5c are up 600% and the march 5c are up 400%. But all in all I am up around 60k I think. I told off my 10k in shares on friday to move into brqs and aezs. keeping my options until expiry or 15/20. All in all not too bad for a $20k investment.

Looking like targeting mid-2021. I don't anticipate much of an impact if any to stock price. I think the main problem with the draft legislation was the amount of uncertainty around it and the poor timing.

You need to put in context that draft fintech regulations were announced, then the ANT IPO was blocked as a result of draft fintech regulations. This caused a decent enough stir amongst investors but stock bounced back pretty quickly.

However immediately after two more pieces of news followed, draft anti-trust regulations AND rumours that it was Xi that personally blocked the ANT IPO.

Any one of these happening in a singular event would have fairly little impact on the share price (except for ANT IPO cockblock, that would always cause a 5-10% hit to BABA).

Reading the draft anti-trust regs it looks like BABA will benefit quite heavily from them actually. Most of the regulations target anti-competitive pricing practices, exclusivity arrangements etc. All things BABA did in the past to get to where it is now but doesn't rely on anymore because it's the biggest fucking dog now.

On the other hand JD and PDD might take a bit of a hit as they are still trying to cement their positions and not having access to these strategies could be perceived as being harmful to them.

All in all not too much to worry about long term. Maybe investors get spooked and sell, maybe they don't. But can be damn sure that if people sell I will buy, this is my #1 stock for the next 10 years.

[Hahaha](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-carl-icahn-151414502.html). No thanks HTZ guy.
INTC data center numbers were poor last quarter vs MRVL is set to grow in that area hugely. That is why I picked MRVL but I think the whole sector is going higher over the next year. 

The other possible downside to the play is there are a ton of value plays/ possible acquisition targets in this sector (ON, Skyworks, just to name a few)

So I guess in a way I have just picked one to hitch my horse to vs diversify with an etf like BOTZ

Chances of getting COVID outside are much smaller. Chances of dying are also, very small.
Sure you can do this. But you‚Äôre never going to see the results or progress you want going this route. It‚Äôs why a lot of newbies give up. You won‚Äôt gain a lot of muscle, strength or lose much weight trying to do it all at once. Cycles of bulking or cutting are what work best.

Yea it‚Äôs because we separated everyone into political extremes the past four years and then decided to make a global pandemic a political issue instead of a health issue.

‚ÄúSince the order does not cancel or freeze rent, all of the tenant's back rent will be due come January 1. Without rent relief or an extension of the protection, many struggling renters will -- again -- face eviction‚Äù

If they signed the treaty we fucking fly our planes like what was agreed upon. If they don‚Äôt like it they can withdraw. This wasn‚Äôt a two party contract. Our NATO allies lose a lot with this treaty. Not sure when we became so soft on Russia but I‚Äôm sure they will continue to do the right thing and we can completely trust them.

Both are good strategies for stocks with expensive options (nvda, shop, amazon, Tsla.) I‚Äôll do a credit spread when something is super overbought on rsi and I‚Äôll do debit spreads when something has an oversold rsi and is at support (for example zoom and shop last week.)

IV is good too but don‚Äôt need to worry about that as much with spreads. I look at IV more when I do naked options

Care to weigh in on how the government has literally taken control of rental properties in the country?  Millions of rental/mortgages are still unpaid due to the eviction moratorium.  
Come Jan 1,2021 this shit show will come to a screeching halt.  The question is who will be on the hook for the thousands owed by renters?

‚ÄúSince the order does not cancel or freeze rent, all of the tenant's back rent will be due come January 1. Without rent relief or an extension of the protection, many struggling renters will -- again -- face eviction‚Äù

I've never looked into it but always wondered - if every car uses lidar doesn't that kind of destroy the technology? Wouldn't it make the environment too noisy for lidar to actually see anything?

It's a similar concept to defeating the radar guns police use - broadcast enough interference and the gun can't tell what "returning" signal is the one it sent and therefore doesn't know how fast the target was going.

If you're in a treaty and the counterparty doesn't comply after repeated warnings of violations, why the fuck would you stay in the treaty?  

Do you stay in a marriage after your spouse repeatedly cheats on you?  Does a loan company allow you to stay in your home after you repeatedly don't pay your monthly payment?  

A weak move would be staying in a treaty where only one side is living up to the obligations.

It won't be easy. I actually believe LOGI should be closer to $90 because they are killing it right now. I think the challenge for CRSR is that they will need to be seen as more than just "for gamers". They can obviously make a living being seen that way, but their growth could be seen as too reliant on gaming. (Though tbh, there's no way gaming doesn't continue to grow). E-sports will only get more money, prizes will get higher, and competitive gamers will see their pay moon.

So Russia didn‚Äôt want to comply with the Treaty and our response is ok we will back out then. There was a ton of other parties in this treaty that are now very compromised because we gave Russia the easy road out. Very weak move by US administration.

He didn't say quit his job or insinuate he'd be set for life, he just said he'd buy a better house and live mortgage free which is a very viable option. Depending on where you live monthly property taxes could be less than a fucking car payment. Is it the wisest idea when mortgages are relatively cheap in the grand scheme of things and it's smarter to just invest that money instead? No, not really. But it's not a terrible idea and knowing you're sitting on 250 grand of equity that can be liquid in 2 months time ain't too bad either.

When would you guys use a credit spread vs a debit spread? Do you base your decision off of the IV? Or is there other factors?

Does anyone ever let options expire?
Off-topic, but I wish there wasn't a stigma against being adopted. I know a few people who were adopted, and whenever it gets brought up, they're slightly embarrassed about it. Why?

You know what being adopted means? 

It means someone went through the ridiculously difficult adoption process to raise you as their child. There's absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about.

It doesn't matter why your biological parents weren't there. Imagine being that loved that someone who isn't directly related to you, or even a complete stranger, would sacrifice a huge portion of their lives to raise you.

And for those reasons, calls on PZZA.

INF: you can't make missiles greater than a certain range.  
Russia: fuck that, we created missiles that fly 1000 km further than the INF limit, but you, United States, should comply to the terms of the agreement!  

Open Skies: you must allow US and Russian flyovers of your territory.  
Russia: we will have regular fly-overs of the US, but you, United States, can't fly over our nuclear facilities, some weapons facilities, and some bases!  

What world do you live in where the US has to stay in a treaty and comply with it's terms, when the counterparty has been flouting it for years?  Staying in both treaties with Russian noncompliance is the "favor gifted to Russia"

The INF especially, where expanding the range of cruise missiles provides deterrence in the Pacific theater against China?

So the punishment to the country who is violating a treaty is to end the treaty how the fuck does that make sense in your world? The only country this is beneficial to is the one who was not complying with the treaty funny it seems another favor gifted to Russia.
AAPL no longer has moon capabilities like TSLA. It's already a $2T company. To moon, that would require a (at least) 20% jump in a short time frame.

No question they will eventually be valued at $4-5T...just not anytime soon.

Wheel it. Start by selling cash secured puts on Tesla to lower your cost basis until assigned.... It's Tesla so holding stock shares isn't the worst thing to happen.

With 316K. You could sell 6 contracts every week or so collecting ~4K every week until assigned. Then when assigned, flip to selling covered calls 40-50% deep OTM  for 563-1.1K per contract. Everyweek you could make somewhere between 3-6k. 

One year? 150-300K again. It's no lotto, but with the money OP has, it's a much better strategy than gambling.
Don't forget selling naked puts at about 2-3% below the current price every time a stock trades down.  With expirations 3-4 weeks out.  If you consistently follow this strategy and roll over, there are much profits to be had. 

Unless of course you don't have the money to cover when the market takes a dive and those OTM are suddenly ITM.

Not when its hanging out like a ball of whipped jello.  Looks like you can suck it out with a vaccum or something.
Options have value based on the number of days until they expire. So as they begin to dwindle they lose more and more value.

Some peoples stock strategy is to purely sell options and make their money hoping the stock doesn't move and theta gives them money as the option heads towards maturity

What's ur strike ?
You'll see my TL:DR post before this, but I think TSLA is going for first mover/ installing themselves as the defacto transportation solution, globally.

If you can have a bespoke national transportation fleet that effectively replaces basically all other modes of transportation (bus, train, cab), and be able to get that green/woke seal of approval from the tree huggers and SJWs, not to mention Elon will negotiate/finesse/kickback whatever's necessary to lock up jurisdictions on LT/exclusivity/govt contracts, I think he'll have a sizable moat for other auto manufacturers, barring govt intervention/backing to overcome.

Edit: LT I see what ur saying about Huawei battle, but I see an APPL iPodesque era of sales/margins for TSLA as it relates to autonomy before having to worry about "smartphone" competition.

Statistically and historically, the market has been strong one trading day before thanksgiving with the next day being weak. Though Black Friday is typically a call for a giant green dildo, I‚Äôm not sure how covid will effect it. Pretty sure everyone pissed away their stimmies on Worthless option trades so maybe Black Friday won‚Äôt be as profitable this year, but still has to be the most profitable day for retail companies regardless

That sounds good on the surface, but, no fapboying (promise), I think Elon is playing 4D chess.

He knows industrial espionage and IP theft is the cost of doing business/way of life out there, so he's basically doing whatever's needed to extract cash from China, meanwhile throwing damn near all his free cashflow into:

- developing non-rare earth metal reliant battery chemistry/next gen manufacturing outside of Gyna
- CoInCiDeNtAlLy sticking to a domestic China battery supplier for Chinese manufactured vehicles (to shield batt IP-for now, at least).
- spending on mfg innovations like a madman to get the cost per unit/production speed down to rock bottom and up to light speed simultaneously.
- building local production footholds in every major vehicle market globally.......simultaneously, to be able to side step tariffs, tap top tier human capital, and extend first mover advantage/market share gains (re: price cuts).

Because he knows all he really negotiated in China was first mover advantage with rampant IP theft and illbegotten market share erosion. But if he's the only one seriously running the autonomy race now, while everyone is running the compelling EV race, he can be the incumbent/moated/national scale govt sanctioned transportation solution before the NIOs and XPENGs even think about ~~stealing~~ competing on that level.

So is theta the guy that collects the premium if the contract expires worthless b/c he wrote the contract?
Yep agreed - as for what valuations that means for these Chinese EV's I have no idea. If TSLA is at 300+ billion and these new Chinese players are at only 30-50 billion theoretically they have a lot of growth to come - especially if you assume they take the Chinese/Asia/Europe market share from Tesla. Tesla can only win if their automated driving is so good that even the Chinese can't compete - I think it will end up like the Huawei vs Iphone market share battle. The biggest problem for China is the view they are 'cheap' and low quality - IF they can manage to shake of that tag then nothing will stop them.

i love seeing the dedication of people pumping PLTR 24/7 every 3 post. Beautiful
RemindMe! One month
I made a joke in reference to a movie. If I thought that‚Äôs what should be done I would‚Äôve cut straight to that point. If you don‚Äôt live here you don‚Äôt know the hate that‚Äôs been placed into Democrats and Republicans and how insane the hardcore cultist Trump supporters are. Not all of them but a lot of them. Also Trump literally said New York won‚Äôt be getting the vaccine what do you think that implies you fucking stooge?
Friend, trust me on this. GME is going to go up very very high. You will see many retail investors turn into millionaires on this sub. 

Keep the time horizon in mind. Buy all the GME you can and just sit till January 15th. You will easily double your money, and most likely see 10X.
Damn your crazy! You don‚Äôt think March will be recovery because the virus will be subsiding by then?
Wacka-wacka-wacka!

We have pretty much the same thesis. If we're talking about TSLA eventual China penetration, I'm with you on a domestic co winning out.

I was talking more along the lines of global sales/market share.
It was. If you think because I was there putting cables in their walls that i‚Äôm doing some illegal trading then your‚Äôre beyond help
But only 30% of the shorts would have to cover. The rest of the shorts could just wait for the price to hit $25 and cover there. 

If 30% covered, then 98% of the float would be shorted and they could all cover near $25.
Why are you grouping yourself in with the cultist? I didn‚Äôt put you there. I didn‚Äôt say every single Trump supporter was a MAGA psycho did I? There‚Äôs the normal level headed people on both sides I can talk with and have conversations about politics with. Then there was this new breed of Trump supporters I‚Äôve never experienced before and fuck those people. If you want to group yourself in with them that‚Äôs your decision.

Steve jobs was before Elon. Just saying
The CCP already forced Elon to drop prices on his cars to qualify for the subsidies - I think it will be a slow strangle more than a brick wall - they will let them coexist but introduce policies that favour their own companies and slowly eat up market share until Tesla's are left to the lower % rich Chinese that want something American. If it becomes clear that the Chinese can produce just a good a car then its game over for Tesla in China. They will have to hope that the Chinese don't succeed in Europe or TSLA will be stuck to only the US market with high market share.
If your only basis for puts is a 100% growth I would disagree and say it has much more potential to grow at such a young age
Ah yes.  The myth, the legend.  You have my blessing.  I know you have been through some tough seas, but there are geen days ahead. I am crowning you Theda gangs king.

Yes, taking a loan to throw into FDs, what a good idea. Go for it. Dont forget to post loss porn and subsequent $ROPE positions.
I've seen the influence and ability the CCP has on 'private' businesses around the world - these fuckers don't lose and are ruthless - tech stealing and all. Good luck taking them to court in China for IP theft lol. I think they will struggle to expand into the US market however Asia/Europe are there for the taking because no one has enough balls to say no to the CCP and put them in their place.

Blaming others for being a nazi doesn't mean it's okay for you to start acting like one. If you unironically believe Trump would kill Democrats then you're seriously retarded. Especially considering it were Democrats talking about making lists of all Trump supporters and putting them in "re-education camps"

And I guess the jews getting those funny little numbers on their arm doesn't count as branding. 

"I would love all MAGA people to be branded forever, but I would never brand anyone or advocate branding someone". At least stand behind your point, pussy. 

I'm not even American and I can see the shitshow you're country is becoming.
Hahaha just because i went there and connected their lights and sockets up? Okay
Apple
*WSB Perfection FTFY
Here's my point of view from a fan and investor in both companies. China is a huge and growing market for EVs. Tesla and Xpeng will co-exist perfectly, China needs Tesla to help increase competitiveness in China and Tesla needs China because it's the world's biggest auto market. Tesla will have the better car and Xpeng will have an (almost) as good version of each Tesla model at a cheaper price. 

The ones that will lose out are the ICE automakers that don't switch fast enough.
I‚Äôm saying for you to be saying this, here, then also investing in said company based off the information you gained from having inside access. Reminds me of this form of securities fraud but I forget what it‚Äôs called.
I posted this two months ago, when SOLO was at $2.50, and the Mar 21 $7.50c were trading at $.25. Mods took it down bc I‚Äôm a beta. I sold out of my position a week later, because I‚Äôm a chump. And now those calls are at $5. FML.

Just because you support the president doesn't mean you take every word/action/thought of his like gospel. Do I think you worship Biden as a god because you voted for him? No. Don't you see how frustrating that is to be called a cultist because you support a political candidate/president. You re coming across as unhinged.
You‚Äôre also more delta positive with shares, which is why a PMCC is usually cheaper. But you‚Äôre also most likely short volatility with a PMCC, the leaps

Do things normally 100% off IPO and then continue or how‚Äôs that work??
Pros of your thesis are companies whose products i use usually go up

Cons of your thesis is the ‚Äúmore garbage cuz covid equals more business‚Äù

All i know is I pay the same each month whether i have 2 garbage cans at the curb or 5.

So if there‚Äôs more garbage that‚Äôs more labor for them, but maybe that cost is somewhat capped cuz unemployment so high etc. 

Anyway, they have to compete for garbage contracts each year so maybe if there‚Äôs more garbage they can beat out the smaller guys because of their scale i don‚Äôt know.

But their customer facing website to pay is kind of trash in my opinion.  

I miss the local garbage company that got in trouble for bribes that lost the contract, they had good service and prettier recycle cans

thanks for this
You are incorrect. Due to gama risk, it is possible for the short leg to increase in value more than the leap. Even if you roll the option forward, you lost money on that trade.

I used to love PMCCs, but I actually fell prey to gamma risk on GME and M in the same week. I ended up making a profit overall, but I decided to take less risk and do shares after that.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, using leaps as collateral is a great way to leverage and make bank, but you open yourself up to a lot more risk than shares.
Then it is bullish for Xpev
My county voted 85% Trump. Every single person I‚Äôve interacted with in the past four years is a trump supporter. Friends and family and coworkers. Some mild supporters, majority out spoken won‚Äôt consider any view point other than what Trump/ Fox News told them. I‚Äôm not exaggerating people I‚Äôve known my whole life became ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù into blaming Hillary and Obama for literally anything going wrong and refusing to consider otherwise.
Stay on the sidelines until it shakes out. Right now it's unclear if the management is tarded or not. In theory it's an awesome idea, in practice Africa isn't a single market, it's like 100 markets and the challenges of operating a real business there are difficult to say the least.

If they pull it off it can be worth megabux but it's definitely up there with one of the riskier investments you can make right now.

The problem is: you would think that unmitigated aggression would lead to a calming effect, when in fact all it does is increase aggression rates.
Every conversation I have had with people about PLTR reinforces the tard stereotype. That said I have found better arguments for buying PLTR on WSB than /r/investing or /r/stocks now there is a bunch of kids with their dicks in their hands.

Dont listen to anyone here! Make a safe play! Put that 10K into GameStop. Fair value is $12, and we are headed into a new gaming console cycle. 

They will make more money in 2 months than in the last 2 years. Also, huge names are behind this company. Lastly, if we get a short squeeze, your shares will 10X easy.

Works the opposite way too
This post deserves some awards. Quite accurate
Um okay but even more reason to but PLTR is that it produces software platforms for the military and other governmental agencies....which is guaranteed income for a recent IPO company. They also have contracts with governmental agencies outside of this country(not China) which makes PLTR at least for the next 3-4 yr a good long term buy.
Except RKT is also not great. It's just profiting because of low interest rates, but so are all of its competitors. I haven't seen anything that's special about RKT, but happy to be proven wrong.

I'm not super pro PLTR btw, and love a hype as much as the next man - I'm just saying that some companies are yeah, and some are actually legit. PLTR and the Chinese EVs seem more legit than say PRPL or NKLA
If you think there were a significant amount of people who blindly followed trump then you are detached from reality. People supported the policies but he didn't have millions of "loyalists" like the MSM wanted to scream

Buttc0in skydiving. Robinhood must be making a killing on the idiots buying it there ‚Äî the spreads are absolutely criminal.
RKT is an amazing company that shit on everyone when the hype was like this.
We‚Äôre still in the beginning stage of the ‚Äúbubble‚Äù. 1,000% upside left for NIO and Tesla before popping
Exactly. Plus, even after Morgan Stanley downgraded it PLTR still rallied more than 6%

I guess so. Feels like I‚Äôve had screaming maga cults shoved down my throat for four years. Blindly supporting anything he‚Äôs done and reciting Fox News.

Oh. Wait. What is today?

I did that but for March
Hype is the same, but the companies are different. GME was pure hype and short covering on a trash company that didn't die when it was expected to.

PLTR at least seems to be a decent company with potential.

Interestingly when I looked into this story thats precisely why he started this weird endeavor.

>After countless sketches and many 3D-printed molds to test the flavor and sensation of different shapes, Labesque created the structure you see here. It optimizes the surface area that strikes your tongue, with two of its edges tapered so that they melt instantly. But it has enough verticality¬†and texture that it‚Äôs more than a thin, substance-less wafer.

Evidently the design in the photo maximizes the above while retaining important mass production properties.
Agree with everything but the parenthesis. To me it is not coincidental that $TSLA shows up and a year later there's a BoOmInG electrified Auto industry in China basically 5 mins later.

I think if Elon is smart enough to silo/air gap China Ops from rest of company (re: IP/tech advances) he can remain competitive in the market until autonomy; then I think it will be a domestic China play to overtake them in that market and TSLA will run autonomous taxis out in rice patties if they're lucky.
Company doesn‚Äôt matter. When everyone is bullish on a stock it dies. Let‚Äôs just see what happens. I just saw Friday was -4.5% and everyone‚Äôs still crazy bullish so I‚Äôm not even sure wtfs going on this a new strain of retard.

I agree. Retail investors don‚Äôt realize how much TSLA‚Äôs numbers in 2020 were due to China sales and how TSLA was a Chinese consumer rebound play this year. 

That‚Äôs why TSLA is so fucked by XPEV making better, cooler cars for less. And if XPEV & NIO were to disappear, there would just be other competitors. There‚Äôs something like a hundred new EV companies in Chiba right now. Musk can drop the price of his cars but he won‚Äôt be able to outcompete them all.

Yeah, Musk is claiming that. He‚Äôs also claiming that they‚Äôre making their own stuff that is inferior to his. He should make up his mind.

The only thing that‚Äôs clear is that XPEV is putting out better, cooler cars for less money and Tesla‚Äôs trying to make excuses for why.

Musk should stop blaming others for the fact that he‚Äôs falling behind after his half decade of lead in the EV market and losing market share to new competitors.

I just might put in my entire net worth into this just to help pump this fucking thing to the moon for you.

XPEV and NIO have the Chinese communist party on their side - they will NOT fail. This will be a China vs US deal - we have already seen how it plays out before (China wins on price at slightly lower quality because not everyone is rich to buy Tesla's).
Given his lame duck status if he did it, he would likely face war crimes. A president cannot unilaterally start a war. That is the House and it starts in Congress. He has emergency powers when a threat is imminent. Most of the world making fun of him on twitter doth not a threat make !
You're right, ears to the street I say. I went to a brunch with a couple old friends the day after Halloween. Rhett aren't investors or into stock.

Regarding your edit, she did not win, Ted Wheeler won reelection. Sauce: I live in Portland. But OP is being retarded and arguing like this is the Politics sub. The left was causing violence in Portland and it was SEVERLY underreported because it made them all look bad. Over 100 nights of distruction, multiple attempts to burn buildings down, throwing rocks, fireworks, and ball bearings at officers downtown. And on top of all that, a leftist (with ANTIFA ties) straight killed a trump supporter on the street downtown and no one seemed to care. Then when US marshals tried to arrest him and he started firing at them and got killed, the left tried to blame the US marshals. I whole heartedly believe this rift and extremism between both sides is being played up in the media to make it worse. But I'm just here to be a degenerate gambler, so I've said my peace on it.
This is actually the truth. This time  last year I had been pretty injured so any real workout was going to be tough. So I went hardcore diet and cut. Had also just quit drinking and my goals was 216 to 140. Got there in June with just massive cutting and diet. To much muscle lost though so I had July through October of this year doing physical therapy to fix mycle imbalances. Now I'm 165 with and I literally have to stop myself because I'll overwork a core day and wreck myself for a week instead of 2 to 3 recovery days.

Everything was bodyweight at home and super strict diet. Gotta bulk a little for winter around my parts since minnesota gets heckin cold for the winter. But no way in hell I'll ever let myself get back above 190 unless I'm super jacked and it's muscle or I'm layed up in the hospital injured.

You gotta target one goal then go for the other one. This is not a "have your cake and eat it too moment". The process of taking the weight off will hinder your ability to rack on muscles unless you have the " strictest diet and routine" with no deviation at all for like 6 to 10 months. NO DEVIATIONS. While it is technically possible it doesn't leave room for anything fun and that level of discipline is just rough.

Given the scope of the potential market and the necessity of what they do for the continued smooth operation of society while technology develops to the point where the exponential growth rate of the population of humans on the planet won't inevitably lead to our extinction, their market cap at fair value is probably like $100b or something.

Too late for my 11/20 calls.  LOL.

But I be rooting for you, good luck.
S&P500 is obviously market cap weighted. So the inclusion of a bloated market cap stock like Tesla obviously has a compounding effect in both directions due to passive vehicles, like index tracking ETF‚Äôs. Tesla is a bit of an enigma as it‚Äôs both tech and by any normal metric over valued.

Tech has clearly been valued based on forward multiples for some time, based on perceived exponential growth and debt liquidity. Growth will slow in a deep recession and liquidity will dry up again, which brings into question those forward multiples. This is probably when you would expect a rotation out of tech into value. 

Since the VIX is based off SP500 volatility, and that volatility gets compounded if there is a disproportionate sell off of higher market cap stocks e.g Tesla in a rotation to value. Then really, long volatility is the trade. Vol appears to be relatively cheap at the moment given some of the potential tail risks.

This is the way
Long term you're right. GME needs to innovate to become a $10B company. Will that happen? Probably not. However, that doesn't mean they are dead.

Google search traffic is **always** consistent. There are tens of thousands of games with at least tens of thousands of search volume for each one. Guess what? As of this past week, Gamestop bids on roughly 2,100 of those keywords. That should be **at least** 100x higher. They should really be bidding on at least 250,000 keywords. Looking at the cost per click, along with all the relevant stats (click to purchase, etc.), GME is looking at a profit of roughly $250-500 per keyword per month (not including COGS). Now imagine that was on 250,000 keywords (and that should really be 500,000 keywords). That's a minimum of $62.5M in monthly profit just from digital sales (again, not including COGS...that's just return on ad spend).

My point is they don't need to innovate. They just need to enter the Google AdWords platform full force...none of this pussyfooting around bidding on a handful of keywords.

Dude, I live in South Africa. I've been browsing their site and I'm genuinely surprised. They're better priced than the other shit I've been using. I'm gonna place an order for something after pay day, if they deliver it quickly and without issue I'm jumping on board. I bought this at like $10 and sold at $13 thinking I was so smart, didn't expect them to actually be successful cause it seemed like a pump and dump. I'm not sure about other countries, but their product range here seems tiny. If they expand it and are able to deliver quickly, they'll absolutely destroy their competitors here ( takealot & bidorbuy ). But right now, in SA at least, their product range in smaller than the retail store down the road from me.

Great post. 

I think the recent post-ER moves to $20+ is due to what you posted. 3rd Party Logistics, Jumia Pay and Operating Profits. Hope we can stay above $20 from now on.

Been buying & holding JMIA since IPO. Bought at $21, $15, $6 and $2. Holding forever. There's no reason Jumia won't be the MELI/AMZN/SEA/FlipKart of Africa. Either they raise more money over and over or we get bought out.

I'm hoping for a return of some explosive top line growth soon, that'll eliminate a lot of the bearish sentiment. 

Also I'm slightly worried about Jumia Pay being overhyped. TPV Growth is impressive but it's all transactions from the Jumia marketplace platform. Management won't say when they plan to scale Jumia Pay to other stores/platforms. It's easy to make it compelling for users to use Jumia Pay when you control the checkout experience yourself. If Jumia Pay scales well outside of Jumias own platforms, this will be huge. What do you think?

Africa is improving fast on all metrics. Internet penetration, e-com adoption, young population etc. Also big things happening in the VC scene there, tech companies are popping up like weeds. Wakanda is real.
Africans wouldn't invest in africa.

That's the point. I live here and I'm browsing through their products, they're actually better priced than I expected. Much better than the other ecommerce sites I've been using. If they get a wider product range over time, I'd definitely switch over.
You‚Äôre the kinda dude who people worry about getting trapped in a conversation with.
Another point noone seems to be talking about is battery swapping. Probably to most used argument against EVs is the range and charging time (add the time you have to wait in line until you even get to the charging port). With NIO growing and a swap station around every corner, which takes as much time as fueling a gasoline car, I belive a lot more people will be choosing EVs and especially NIO
I'm at that point where I'm not sure if it's a great company or a big ass hype.

EM physician, I‚Äôll give my thoughts

Possibly good short term hype play, likely dump and flat for 1-2 years after initial run up, then slow build for boring hold

Problem is that, like everything else in the world, or at least USA, medicine is a business focused on money. What does that mean? Most hospitals and institutions will not stand to make much of a profit off of these devices themselves, as the ‚Äústudies‚Äù people will be doing with them will likely be brief and cursory and lead to formal studies being ordered. This will lead to these being mostly a niche tool, though not to say they won‚Äôt serve a purpose.

For example, most EM residencies nowadays train extensively in US, and a graduate can become US ‚Äúcertified‚Äù or US ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù. The former essentially says you know how to use one, the latter is more extensive training with minimum study numbers from a US fellowship trained supervisor that pretty much tells whoever hires you that your good enough to be able to bill. 

The issue here is that ACEP, our governing body, does not really have a true standard in play yet for residencies, has not updated their guidelines since 2016 (I believe), and leaves it to the residencies to self govern, with some places graduating residents with far under the 150 scan recommendation. This means that institutions and hospitals will have no comfort or basis to allow billing privilages for the majority of POCUS imaging aside from the basics, which happen to be the easiest. Compare this to the sonographers that have very stringent training and certification, as well as the radiologists who both do and intercepted the studies. Also, good luck not having the radiology department try to block the billing privileges in the first place as not to lose their revenue if it‚Äôs a private practice staffing the institution, which is still common.

Where does this leave POCUS from a revenue generating standpoint?Not in the greatest shape in the current insurer and medical legal landscape. All imaging obtained to be billed has to be stored and available for review and auditing. In the truly critically ill, no one enters patient info or saves the images. An E-FAST in the trauma bay or in a code is typically used to guide the event, not generate revenue. Most internists aren‚Äôt doing a GB on a floor patient, we do that in the ED, but good luck getting a surgeon to take the patient to the OR off your bedside scan without the formal (I‚Äôve had it happen, but it‚Äôs rare)

So where will this generate money?  As OP said, outside the hospital and US healthcare system. Otherwise this is just another tool one can have at their disposal, but only if they know what they are doing, how to do it, how to interpret, and stay up to date (like how truly useless looking at an IVC is...)

TLDR: This is a great tool with currently incredibly limited revenue generating capability in the current healthcare and insurance setting, at least in the US, which will likely leave this as a niche product in the first few years. Expansion into other areas outside the Hospital/institution setting is where this will shine. 

Also, short AYRO this week.

Yeah, I held CCL for way too long. Bought it early hoping it would come back, but every time the company hit $20 a share they would issue a new round of stock funding crashing it.  Finally sold out at $18 for about 10% gains, but damn could have had that money in something else during the bull run.

All puts now on CCL.  This is great news for me.
Not in some states.

Investopedia is good for describing the various patterns. Start with the fib retracements on their site then look into wedges, flags, etc. important thing is to recognize which patterns are continuations and which are reversals and where resistance points are. Wsb is full of people who deny ta because it‚Äôs astroturfed with people who want you to lose money for their gain. TA is critical for understanding where breakouts happen and where it‚Äôs going to land

Wierd.  I know they do that to hypnotize Republicans , but I dont watch TV or youtube videos for that reason , i just write about it alot all over different social media. Heres something cool you might not know . The president and the goverment release stock tips to the public but only the Masonic elites probably know when it happens , and it always has huge stock tips hidden in plain sight.  They did it for tesla back in March  at the bottom of the tip . And they continue to do it , through the news announcements.  Heres a cool one I just did . Brad Raffensperger was just in the news last week but if you rearrange the letters of his name..you get....Fn Fear ge spread brr

Well you can play spreads with less capital but in general just look at less expensive contracts. I wouldn‚Äôt sell tesla contracts with 2k but maybe stocks trading around 15-35$

Young Caesar was locked in a pirate ship cell with his crew. Many died but the ones who ate the meager rations they got and used their own and each other's body weight to stay fit survived. 
Caesar was released eventually when a ransom was paid for him. He returned and slaughtered the pirates because they'd offended him with too small a ransom. 

TLDR: do some pushups, pussy.

Yes, you have no idea.
If you‚Äôd asked this same question about MELI in 2010 you‚Äôd have missed when it ran from $20s to $1400. This hasn‚Äôt mooned, this hasn‚Äôt even left the launchpad. It‚Äôs a long play though and still has to prove itself over the next couple years.
let me drop some DD on you.

Read my former posts about tesla if you want to understand the reason why tesla will go up.

we're in day 5 of 30 in this tesla bull run because billions of dollars will buy and hold tesla.  The floor was at \~400.  That new floor is now ATLEAST 460.  Wait 2 weeks that floor will probably be 500.

Anyways the DD.

Tesla go up=all the other EV's ride the coat tails but actually grow more percentwise.

money printer go brr.  Atleast for another month.
60? Yes. 65? Hard to say but it seems likely
Except all the times he was right. 

Nonetheless, it‚Äôs just discussion and information. You should be trading off your own research, not others.

SOLD! BY THE RETARD WHOS DD IS HERE SAY!

All in on stocks, you boys better pump this bitch.
Got in on Arcimoto at 9.750. Holding for dear life.
1. This is more true than I see it mentioned here

2. As it pertains to GME‚Äôs current business model, that doesn‚Äôt come into play within the lifespan on the company (if you‚Äôre assuming it will fail). As likely as it is there‚Äôs still far too much negative speculation on GME to say it isn‚Äôt priced in. 

Though, for the sake of argument, both of those things are huge opportunities where GameStop could establish themselves as the Netflix instead of the blockbuster. They already flubbed mobile. But if they manage even a minor turnaround in the short term, they‚Äôre currently trading far below their brand name. If they were clearly headed anywhere but irrelevance - they‚Äôd be in an absolutely PRIME position to capitalize on these trends. More uniquely than other first-to-mind options for partnerships because of their b&m presence. 

In terms of WSB yolos I do like this one for shares. If you check /r/GameStop the employees are currently miserable and understaffed which is hugely bullish.
That‚Äôs factually incorrect. They impeached trump for trying to get a foreign country to interfere in an US election by investigating a political opponent (and implicitly threatening withholding aid). Inb4 yes I read the transcript.

Hillary conceded the day after, and Obama invited trump to the White House the day after that to begin the transition. There was never any doubt that Trump won. Liberals weren‚Äôt contesting the results. We‚Äôre they concerned about Russian interference? Yes and that‚Äôs because the intelligence agencies found a good amount of evidence for it. US intelligence agencies have not found any evidence of systemic fraud in 2020 elections.

My work has a hand in distro and we were told on Friday that it‚Äôs looking like best case scenario we have it in hand for the initial tier of shots in 8 weeks. Half of that was the approval process. It was a MS Teams meeting so I was probably reading wsb instead of paying close attention.
AOC/Sanders is what we in Europe call Social Democrats and are mainstream capitalist parties, just with a focus on the social net.
Note that, theoretically in a neutral market, selling OTM puts and ATM puts gain the same per one trade in terms of net gain vs loss. You win 9 small lose 1 big, or win 5 big and lose 5 big. Timing, support, IV are probably more important than just the win percentage.

I.e. a 85% win percentage for a 15% return is still a net loss. (85% chance of 15% = 12.75%, 15% chance of -100% = -15%, net -2.25% per trade)

If you already knew that then this is just for the other readers :)

Al Gore thought he was President for 30 days before the courts over ruled that. 

There have already been 2000 votes in one GA county found not counted. And on a purely anecdotal note, a friend of mine checked his ballot after he voted and it was not counted.

And fuck faux news too . They're not even news .
Check out optionsprofitcalculator. For example if you bought a 12/11 19.50/21.50c debit spread it would close at 77% profit if RKT was at 21.50 or above at expiry. You don't need huge moves to make money with spreads

Kind of funny that both WSBs NIO puts AND calls expired worthless. You guys know you don't have to buy 50%+ OTM right?
1.  Selling the deep ITM option will net you the intrinsic value (call: strike - stock price, put: stock price - strike).  If your ITM call is deep enough, you probably won't pay for any extrinsic value and you'll get pure delta movements.  So no issue with selling deep ITM.

2. If your forecast is double the current price, you should do some OTM calls with the same expiry or bull debit spreads.  You're paying quite a bit due to the extrinsic value of the option.
touched 506 last week, probably gonna touch 600 by wednesday or thursday

Three things to note. 

1. He made the statement on wechat, this is because he is Chinese and twitter is banned. This is important because nothing coming out of China has any value whatsoever.  Its just stolen IP put together by people who's education consisted more about celebrating the greatness of the communist party than actual engineering.  

2. He made the statement in Chinese, this is because he is Chinese. This is important because nothing coming out of China has any value whatsoever.  Its just stolen IP put together by people who's education consisted more about celebrating the greatness of the communist party than actual engineering.  

3. It follows the same style as when the CCP threatens countries with dire consequences for acknowledging the existence of Taiwan.  A loan of waffle that means nothing.  Before you buy this stock,  ask yourself.  Would you buy their product? Ask everyone you meet,  would they buy their product.  Chances are they wouldn't.  They would either buy a tesla,  wait for an electric car from Ford,  or VW, or Toyota,  or GM, or never buy an EV.

In short,  stay clear of this stock.  It is pumped to fuck by autists. It will move a lot based on speculation,  people losing their nerve and pulling out,  people looking for easy gains on short term sales.  But there is very little underlying value.  This is the CCP using the Americans to fund them. You might as well being investing in $CCP

Had someone been sleeping in one of those buildings, arson is now murder. Violence is violence bud.
Yea chances are slim to none Tesla fails in China. But this is something interesting I heard in the NIO earnings call last week: in the last year Tesla cut prices 3 times. This is in line with what you‚Äôre saying about Tesla focusing on market share, which is indeed smart for them.

But here‚Äôs what NIOs CEO said about the 3 price cuts: first price cut towards end of last year/beginning of this year, NIO sales took a significant hit. Second time a few months later, NIO sales fell but by a lot less than first Tesla price cut. Third price cut in October, NIO has record breaking month in orders and deliveries. And XP is experiencing similar trends. And overall the Chinese luxury car market is in the millions of cars sold per year. So still a lot of room to grow for all of them.

In terms of autonomous driving in China. I think ultimately the winner will be the one that the govt supports. Something as critical as traffic infrastructure, you‚Äôd need CCP support. And it really doesn‚Äôt matter if you have superior tech if CCP isn‚Äôt on your side. My guess is they will pick whoever gives them the most/total access and control of the system. So we‚Äôll see. Could very well be Tesla‚Äôs approach but could very well not
Can confirm from Portland, mostly peaceful: 93% of buildings were not burned down

I started investing in april with 10 dollars and used the governments unemployment checks to add funds in the market every 2 weeks , its 7 months later ,unemployment ran out but I'm 30 % on RH and 18% on cash app that only lets you buy in dollars ,but combined they're around 6k  and I have no idea what I'm doing but it pays and it's free money anyways so if I blow it , at least I tried for real with free money to make more free money .

It's a decent move, just don't fall in love with it, sell when you're happy with gains and wouldn't consider buying that same option at that price. 

Liquidity will be fine on DKNG, just adjust your ask closer to the bid if it doesn't sell right away. gl

In a good way or bad way? For whatever reason, I have an easier time wrapping my mind around ITM options - they are less subject to time decay and other factors I don't yet have a good feel for. While I might be paying a little more, I am paying for built in value, which I view as a sort of insurance policy. Please feel free to correct my logic though...

No actual violence? If you owned one of those "few buildings " that were burned you would consider it arson. Arson is a form of violence.

It‚Äôs because EV owners have EV chargers and everywhere people live has electricity.

There are a lot of older apartments that don‚Äôt have EV charging yet - but it‚Äôs much more likely they will add them than it is that EV owners will go to the ‚Äúgas station‚Äù model. 

If there is a future for ChargePoint it is in rev-sharing with apt complex owners.

The police was running out of time and his victims running out of money, until WSB caught him.

*Current* EV owners *usually* charge at home. This makes sense as the majority of EV owners are higher income and as such have a charger at their house. 

As EV‚Äôs proliferate, a consequence of  declining entry level price points and sustainability trend continuance, those who live in housing situations incompatible with private charge-points will begin to make up a material percentage of the addressable market. To add, Chargepoint also offers at-home charging systems to individual electric vehicle owners.

On 11/9 when SPX gapped up i knew that gap was gonna get filled quick and it did. Felt more like a false breakout. The thing is, if stimulus bill somehow passed, your sold calls are going to hurt you too much, especially holding over night.

That‚Äôs possible, there‚Äôs growing regs on gas powered cars. 

They‚Äôre not even that competitive in the Chinese EV market though. They sit at a strange price point here, cheaper than a Tesla model X/S, but more expensive than everything else. 

EVs of a slightly lower quality can be found at almost 50% of the price.

Gaggia Classic Pro is fucking awesome. You will make REAL espresso and it‚Äôs a solid machine that will last at least a decade. And it has an awesome milk frother. Go for a machine that you can do non-pressurized filter baskets in. You do need a burr grinder for non pressurized though which is another $200 (Baratza Sette 30 is a solid, cheaper one).

If it‚Äôs too expensive then I strongly recommend a nespresso (classic, not vertuo). This version gets up to a pressure necessary to produce crema. It‚Äôs pretty good.

What ever you do I wouldn‚Äôt go for a machine that can only do pressurized filter baskets. At this point you‚Äôre better off with a nespresso. The shots are more consistent and better, and its cheaper. Once you try non pressurized (and get good at it, it takes practice!) you‚Äôll never go back. I recommend watching ‚ÄúWhole Latte Love‚Äù videos on youtube.

This clown lucked out in March and is now proclaiming to be a part of "smart money." It's easy to make money during a bull market that's propped up by the Fed.

Why does XPEV CEO speak as if this is their tech? Aren't they using intel's mobileye autonomous tech?
My man.

Regarding the comparison: it was meant more as a fear based comparison. Not a comparison of what they do, obviously they are different.

I'll tell you what tho, I didn't invest 364% of my portfolio on RKT like I've done with PLTR.

All the DD I've come across, both on Reddit and on my own, has me to believe that it will rise more. My presumption is that it will hit $40 by Q2 2021. At that price point, I'll exit half my positions to get my initial investment back.

Maybe naively optimistic, but given the cookie jars their hands are in and their current market cap, I don't think it's impossible.

QE is deflationary no doubt. But the fiscal stimulus is inflationary. And there's a damn good chance we see fatty stimulus in 2021. By putting money directly in people's hands, velocity can pick back up. 


I think that they're going to be a little too heavy handed with the fiscal once they do it and think "hey look, no inflation". Then it will happen all at once. 


Ultimately not sure if inflation really hits in 21 or 22 but it's coming. 1970s style. Own hard assets.

For all you retards, typical market falls right before Thanksgiving. 

Plan your moves.
Are you selling options against your shares? You should at the very least be taking those profits out to diversify. You have all your eggs in one basket and 600k is more than enough to invest correctly and be set for life. It‚Äôs your life and your choice but 30k to 600k is massive and leaving it all on the table without diversifying and protecting yourself is not smart. It takes one market crash and one competitor making a superior product or receiving a Amazon contract to crash it beyond recovery (see INTC)

Considering they tend to think that people are "fleeing California" because "it's a massive shithole they ruined and no one wants to live there" despite the extremely high property value that makes it expensive and can't figure out the correlation, no, I don't think they've ever considered that.

As someone who had a paid off house and then burnt through the rest of my savings fixing up that house's unforseen problems, I can assure you that the mortgage would've been much preferred. I would've made soooooo much more money with the equity than I did holding the property, and not had to stress about spending so much on repairs. In fact, after repairs, I didn't even save on what I would've been paying if I had rented. I was paycheck to paycheck for a while. It was extremely stressful.

Always borrow against your assets. It's what smart people do. UNLESS you are so rich that owning things outright makes almost no dent in your finances.

If anyone tells you TSLA isn‚Äôt going to pump off being included in the 500, simply remind them that it nearly doubled off absolutely nothing other than offering red shorts for sale. If that doesn‚Äôt convince them make them aware of even higher ATH high it made when it took one share and turned it into four. Literally adding no value or innovation to the company everything was the exact same as the day before except the share price was displayed at 1/4th the value. If TSLA doesn‚Äôt hit 600 minimum on inclusion day the SEC needs to investigate for manipulation.

Lol carvana isn't selling lambos or just beamers either, is way better brand recognition/more popular/well-known so anybody looking for a car is going to either go to carvanas website or they're going to get told by someone "oh use carvana thats what I did", also has better/faster logistics, has fucking vending machines scattered around if someone is antsy and wants a car that day, better customer service,  and has a much wider inventory along with way higher cash flow to keep up that inventory and get better deals with partnerships to undercut vroom if it came down to it. Very dumb investment, comparable to investing in craigslist when you could invest in amazon or even more comparable buying a literal piece of shit when you could buy a high end hooker to shit on your chest - way better experience for the same thing

i really appreciate the advice, but I've made and lost half of this money twice, already. so much is in the shared and so much in leaps that even if there's a crash (highly unlikely), I'll recover a significant amount by 2022. even the covid black swan event only took the market down for a couple months. 

i have a house in San Francisco, though it does have a massive mortgage. that being said, my mortgage rates is around 3.5%, so it would cost so much profit to pay that off with my gains. 

this company is set to have explosive growth over the next couple of years. it's truly such a powerfully rare opportunity that i just can't pass it up

I think of the other EVs as altcoins. Pretty sure they ran a little long and topped after shitcoin did back then. It‚Äôs really the exact same thing, TSLA creates the bubble, then people flood into the cheap dogs shit companies as the bubble reaches maturity. TSLA will drop 50% from where ever it peaks in the next couple months, and the ‚Äúalt EVs‚Äù will all see 60-80 percent declines. Should only take a year to unravel.

Holy shit man that‚Äôs amazing! Congrats. Make sure you take profit and keep yourself protected. This market is record over valued and the fed can‚Äôt prop it up forever. Also with the massive runs green energy is having the past month it‚Äôs a great time to lock in some profits. 600k is some serious money make sure you protect it. It‚Äôs a great time to cash some out and buy land with. Entire economy could collapse but your land value will stay the same. Lots of good deals now too with people hurting for cash. Good luck man!
Why the 20k limit? For like 10k you can find something that's fun and decently reliable in the used market. Keep a few grand in the bank for repairs and you should be set for a while

i honestly don't think this is a bubble. the way i look at it, we're seeing a paradigm shift. EVs are the future- many countries are looking forward and making strides to fight climate change and reduce oil dependency. Here in America, the prospect of a green new deal is viable given the political climate. Covid had a side effect of showing the general population how much of an impact we have on the climate and how much of a difference we can make. With a lot of these EV companies, given how many cars there are in the world, it'd be extremely short-sighted to discredit this as a bubble when in reality they're vastly undervalued. The market is just catching up to EVs. We'll start to see this trend start hitting clean energy companies soon, although I imagine it will be spread out more as there are many more companies, and many of them are well-established.

I'm almost all in on enph. i started with about 30k that i invested starting last April and I'm up to 600k in my two accounts now, and I've pulled that 30k out, so it's all profit

i have 750 shares, and about 90% of what's left in enph is in 2022 leaps I'm up at least 220% in each of the different sets of LEAPs I'm holding. 

the company has been trading in the same channel for 4 years. In 4 years that same channel puts the price over 1k/share. 

I'm not selling, and nobody else should be, either
at 19 a 20k car loan is enough to pretty much enslave you, unless you have an unusually high income which I'm guessing you don't because you're asking us this question

The aughts called. They want their hot take back.
>Initial doses go to first responders

they tried it by inoculating 500k medical personnel in 90s regarding anthrax during first iraq war. did not end well back then, i doubt it would end well now especially with "untested" the selfmutating vaccines ...

i got zero issue with 40+yo vaccine coctails for kids. but this mRNA tech just screams umbrella corporation ...
Not if you made the correct choice and got a tesla.

A tragic accident and the guy that got screwed was the only person in that room that was the first to say he had to be in a while and then I come over and over to my house I thought I had to be in a while to see you before you were to me about a woman. Always about a woman.
Real talk for a moment. So I was talking to this chick at my work, whose last day was Friday, and she‚Äôs insistent that her and I need to try shrooms together. She said she‚Äôs done LSD before but not shrooms and thinks it would be great for us to experience it together for our first times...

You gotta turn it into tea, takes away all the nausea. Was a game changer for me. Some on my hardest psychedelic trips are from shroom tea.

Actually model 3 is even out selling its ice competitors, in fact I personally believe Tesla‚Äôs sales in China played a critical part in this year‚Äôs performance. One country contributes over 100K car sells a year right after its factory starts production shows Tesla is eating market shares in China like a buffet. 23.3% of the revenue comes from China. 1.4 Billion dollars in first half the year. Without my government‚Äôs support they don‚Äôt stand a chance.

Responding to your edit, I‚Äôve been saying that it‚Äôs coming to that for years. The insane divide that has been created between political views, race, cops, anti-vac etc. hasn‚Äôt been by accident and I‚Äôve got to admit it‚Äôs been way more effective than I ever imagined possible. You got all of us fighting each other distracted while the 1% has been gathering up staggering amounts of wealth in the background. I lost my shit when republicans started saying democrats shouldn‚Äôt accept the $1200 Trump check. They are so caught up in fighting they don‚Äôt realize ~50k of debt was printed per citizen $1200 to you, $48000 to Airlines, Banks, Churches etc. I‚Äôm hopeful one day everyone will realize it‚Äôs not the wellfare recipients, students who want loans forgiven or immigrants who come here for better lives that cause all the hardships. It‚Äôs the 1% at the top who have syphoned all the wealth and strapped us with the debt that is fucking us over. I‚Äôm surprised heads havent already started rolling from this shutting people down and giving them no compensation. The ‚Äúbattle‚Äù that‚Äôs gone on for months to get people stimulus makes me want to go to Washington myself and I don‚Äôt even need it. Peoples lives, careers and business have been thrown away and they have $1200 to show for it. Pretty fucked.

I think China will allow Tesla AI on Chinese streets, however I suspect that Tesla will not want their AI on Chinese streets for years after it has hit the rest of the world.  The reason is that Chinese driving is unpredictable. Most police in Chinese cities do not ticket for moving violations. Because of this, the rules are much looser and human behavior is harder to predict.

y‚Äôall ever notice how shitcoin always has the worst charts on RH, shitcoinbase, etc... everything is programmed to display a decent looking trend that hides selling and big volatility to the downside. that‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs a scam.
Price targets 15.00+ , they completely revamped their entire business model. They will be debt free and turning a profit in early Q1. That‚Äôs like saying don‚Äôt buy NIO because it was trading at 1.50 last year at this time. Companies change, valuations change. TOTALLY different setup. New CEO also.
Of course it is okay to criticize, it is the way he criticizes. Arrogant, mad and no class. The Chinese version is more volatile in languages.

I don't think so either. It's a treatment, so it won't solve the problem which is the rapid spread of the disease.

Now SBE (Chargepoint).. that's a $20 billion company 5 years out.
Wow. Yeah I looked into them. They suck. They just rode the wave up because EV went on a rip last week. It should settle down. I do have shares and sold covered calls. Ended up losing 100 shares @$9 when they got called away. Still made a nice profit but I would‚Äôve liked to hold em. I can‚Äôt see this stock over $7-8 but it can get that momentum to rise solely because of EV. It‚Äôs bullshit because the company really sucks and their solo car is so ugly too on top of that shitty range/charge that you mentioned

Ultimately it‚Äôs on him to prove if he can live up to them and we‚Äôll see if he‚Äôs right
Ok just went and checked and it had its best week of all year last week and went up $1.68 so not only will it have to do it‚Äôs best two weeks back to back, it will have to double to hit your goal.

JMIA is already working to improve everything Africa needs for ecommerce to flourish. and they've accomplished much of that in a short amount of time. "gmv and orders down" without context is a killer and why it sold off and bounced. gmv was down because their higher $ value operations were drastically reduced. excluding those, GMV was actually up.

also, never mind where JMIA is headquartered. DD the co-CEOS -- they've got years of experience in Africa. it's where their passion lies.

It looks to be consolidation at the moment. Stock price movement after this point would be dependent on other factors. ARVL (currently CIIC) has blue-chip partners in Hyundai, KIA, and UPS. Notably: signed contracts with total order value up to $1.2+ billion, including 10,000 Vans from UPS. Good long-term prospect and enters a relatively unique market in commercial EVs. This is something I'm currently invested in because I hate driving behind buses that emit exhaust into my cabin air filter.

this post and many of the responses to it make me think of how warren buffett says "most people won't put in the time to get a knowledge advantage"

everything OP points out is what i and most of the market thought when this thing IPO'ed and subsequently floundered. this whole week i've been doing DD in bits and pieces, culminating in going over the recent conference call transcript. it's legit impressive what this company has done in such a short amount of time. the damage from Citron's short report continues to have a lasting effect as most of the market has shrugged off JMIA and dismissed them as a scammy stock in a scammy continent and one to avoid. this is totally inaccurate. they're increasingly proving to be lean, mean, and eager to prove themselves.

go back to what the CEOs said a year ago -- they were focused on becoming profitable. and as of this last quarter, they made significant progress on that front. yeah, as OP said, their cutting business in three countries, as it turns out, *was* prudent business decisions, not a reflection of poor market research or some shit. they have cut several verticals including travel booking to focus on what's working. in what world is that bad business?

moving on, at first, i thought JMIA was simply the AMZN of Africa. wrong. they're SQ, PYPL, GRUB, and FDX.

their reduction in GMV was a result of quickly dropping the far less profitable higher end bulky electronics and focusing on consumer goods -- a la GRUB. not only did they actually INCREASE GMV when you exclude the electronics (\*for those who don't know, GMV is a measure of e-commerce success, and the drop in cumulative GMV is why the stock reacted poorly initially), they also drastically improved margins. 

re: the logistics and infrastructure. logistics were a HUGE headwind for JMIA, and was something even noted by Citron when they were short -- logistics in Africa can be a nightmare. JMIA basically had to pioneer a successful, scalable logistics network that they're just starting to put to work for third party sellers. they're basically acting like a sort of FDX or UPS if i'm understanding this correctly.

asked about their logistics infrastructure and monetizing it, the CEO had this to say on the conference call:

"Yes. I think the size of the opportunity is, I think, enormous, right? And I say that because we know when we started that business eight years ago, we were dreaming of finding a Jumia Logistics, right? And we built Jumia logistics, of course, because in a way, we had to, we had no choice, right? **And if \[there\] had been a very extremely efficient fulfillment ecosystem where we could have told our sellers just to drop your package, and they'll take care of everything, then we would have leveraged that, right**? ***So we had to create this***, and it's been a very, very big investment from us in terms of resources, in terms of technology, in terms of time. And I think now, we have it. And now, this asset, I think it's a very, very sizable opportunity because we think we have a very unique system.

We have a very unique system, which provides end-to-end visibility, reliant -- or reliability, sorry, and cost attractiveness to every single SME who needs to move goods from A to B. So I don't know exactly the size, but I think it's extremely sizable. And with that in mind, we are really in the phase where **we have successfully piloted the service in multiple countries. When I say piloted, it means that we've had a few hundred consumers who have** **consistently and regularly** **shipped package with us.**

And we think that we are now ready to scale. And that we're going to gradually go out and start pitching the service to consumers, to sellers, to SME and just scale it at the rhythm at which they come to us. So certainly, we will never compromise the Jumia business in case there is a trade-off to be made, and we will limit the capacity if we have to. And we will see how it's coming in the next two months."

&#x200B;

re-read that, again and again. to quote the CFO elsewhere in the call: "The potential for further monetization is both on the core e-commerce marketplace, but also on the assets that underpin the marketplace, digital payments, and logistics in particular." the CFO also had this to say about the logistics:

"We have now launched logistics as a service offering where third-party businesses can access the Jumia Logistics platform to help them meet their delivery needs. And I would like to give you more context and color on this initiative. **Logistics in Africa are notoriously challenging with multiple hurdles such as lack of addresses, a lack of organized and reliable capacity, storage space issues, the predominance of cash on delivery, and so on. With Jumia Logistics, we have built a tech-rich platform uniquely adapted to address these challenges**.

We leverage a network of other 300 third-party logistics partners that we manage through a proprietor back stack. That allows us to have a full visibility on the journey of the package, manage all fulfillment workflows, and optimize delivery time through volume allocation and smart footing. In parallel, we have an extensive network of least physical locations including warehousing space in every single country where we operate and over 1,300 consumer pickup stations and vendor drop off stations. **It is now possible for third-party businesses to access this platform for last-mile delivery services or end-to-end fulfillment services, including warehousing, picking and packing, and last mile**.

**We are very pleased to offer the services of our logistics platform to solve major distribution pain point in Africa**. We hope this will serve as a catalyst to drive more trade in the countries where we operate while generating more volumes for the logistics SMEs that form part of our network."

&#x200B;

keep in mind, and as Citron pointed out, these SAME EXACT criticisms you pointed out -- the diverse and conflicting cultural landscape, the infrastructure, the 3rd-worldliness -- were all criticisms of MELI 10+ years ago. 

TL;DR: JMIA is more than AMZN of africa. they've focused on what works and as a result they've already improved their margins, cut losses, and proven themselves nimble and capable enough to pivot as necessary. they learn, they implement. that's what you want to see in a growth company. they also have multiple UNTAPPED revenue sources in Jumia Pay and their logistics network. **this is a $1000 stock in 10 years.** and nobody is paying attention -- only 6 analysts follow it. but look at the volume in the last six months, and check out the over 40 institutions that started positions as of 9/30. watch for even more when the next filings come out.

Holy shit, they're 2 billion in the hole. Amazing. From their SEC filing:

>Our substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition. We had outstanding indebtedness with a principal amount of $1,997.5 million as of September¬†30, 2020.

Their interest expense so far this year is 107 million. Holy moly.

Edit: I'll buy it if there's good price action, but long term this isn't sustainable for them. That's a zombie company right there.

My DD for DRAFTKINGS/DKNG

Take a step back from your phone. Think about what‚Äôs happening. Sports are back on TV. People are stuck inside. The upper and upper-middle class has a lot of extra money right now from not traveling and not going out to eat. Online gambling just got legalized in Michigan and Virginia. As someone who has friends in the wealthy suburbs of each state, I can tell you DKNG is about to get flooded with cash come January once the states new measures take effect. DRAFTKINGS is the most well known online betting website, and that‚Äôs was even before the current news regaurding legal betting. 
More stimulus money is coming in, which equals more gambling money. Think about all the degenerates who aren‚Äôt able to go gamble at the casino or in Vegas right now. They‚Äôre gonna go to DKNG. 
Another analyst raised his price target to $100 this past Tuesday, with it currently sitting at $48. Its an easy options play. I see this at $90 by end of March easily.

I actually know him but didn't know his exact positions. On the websites the update is from September .now this portfolio is worth over 1 M . He knows what he is doing but also the portfolio return gets boosted from tesla gains. That's why he would never sell them. Don't know what to think of his 3 new big stocks for the next million (what he said) 2 of them are dropbox and beyond Meat i forgot the 3rd. Maybe he is onto something with beyond meat (brand recognition and super strong growth + china factory) dropbox has to many shorts imo.

What‚Äôs the theory behind Nio growing into a decent company. I‚Äôm a fan of EVs and based in China so I can get hands on with most of the new releases. I just can‚Äôt see Nio doing that great, most of the other manufacturers are producing cars that are almost of the same quality, for a far cheaper price. 

I just don‚Äôt get it, what‚Äôs their plan? Why‚Äôs their stock a good buy? Because their cars certainly aren‚Äôt at the moment.
>The western media‚Äôs villainising of China is archaic tbh and I find it hilarious that they‚Äôre ok with what the NSA and CIA have been doing for decades and yet are so paranoid about state run Chinese firms

It isn't villainizing, it's a realistic view of the geopolitical landscape. China is a growing power that wants to be a superpower, and contends with other major powers both economically and through methods like espionage. 

They're more of a threat globally than classic boogeymen like Russia, and they're pushing into Africa and the South China sea with expansionist goals. Anyone who can't see that is blithely unaware or has pro-China sentiments. 

I don't see how it would even be controversial to portray China and the US as being at the start of a cold-war situation, and the current weapons of mass destruction are the ability to destroy the opposing country infrastructure with the push of a button.

Giving an expansionist foreign superpower the ability to shut down your electric grid, communications, etc at the push of a button when you make them angry is a vulnerability of the highest order, and the CIA and NSA are right to recognize and do their best to prevent that for the US and our allies.

I heard from a guy on WSB who heard from his friend who heard from his professor recommended $PLTR.  To the moooon!!!
If Jack Ma doesn't slow down the party would have to make him disappear...otherwise the technocrats begin to usurp the CCP as a new ruling class. Wouldn't it be more likely that China tries to tighten its state owned grip on rech companies?
Thanks man I genuinely appreciate that

Xpev is overbought anyways. Dr Ammon Shashua from mobileye also believe a lidar+camera based architecture is the path to truly save autonomous driving because these two systems will work independently as a fail safe to each other. I actually liked this strategy better but Elon is Elon. What I don‚Äôt like is how Xiaopeng responds to Elon‚Äôs criticism, arrogant and no class. Leadership personality can decide the fate of a company.

Basically there is no such thing as feeling good about yourself in NYC. In every direction there are people who are doing better than you in every possible way and a lot of times all at once. You're probably on the subway next to a neurosurgeon / fitness model a six pack who trades options between patients and donates the tendies to charity.
Fixing the system requires calling the system what it is. Can‚Äôt give bailouts and massive tax breaks to one and not the other in capitalism. If we are in a capitalist economy I know some businesses that owe A LOT of taxes to make up their fair share and A LOT of debt (let‚Äôs call it 4.5% rate to keep it fair) on some hefty bailout loans they received. If we are doing the socialism thing then charge the corporations you believe are to big to fail the tax rate it takes to pay UBI to citizen. In return they get their monopoly officially. I don‚Äôt care either way but this 1/2 and 1/2 is coming to a dangerous snapping point.

I think battery swap sounds nice in theory if we all charged and discharged at an equal rate in a vacuum. But basically this is going to open the flood gates for battery abusers who give no shits about proper charge and discharge... so do they charge higher premiums for the ones who wear their batteries down quicker?? They should‚Äôve just left it to die like Tesla did. Too many of these companies just waiting on daddy xi to bail them out if they go tits up and honking themselves on getting that amzn valuation where they‚Äôll ‚Äúeventually profit.‚Äù 

What most of these mopes don‚Äôt understand is that Tsla needed to scale to become profitable. Moreover they are doing other things for revenue too like energy storage/solar/carbon credits. NIO is producing a fraction of what tsla does, with only 15-18% margin on asp... they‚Äôre at tsla valuations from like 5 years ago but doing everything opposite of tsla like not selling the high end, high margin cars. I like that my nio shares are at 50 but Wall Street is literally duping main St because for once main st out smarted them with tsla so now they‚Äôre trying to make up for the missed bag
It was dark. Then all of a sudden I saw one thing...

Now that PLTR is on a lot of people's gaydar, it can moon $30+ on a new billion dollar contract. I think it will happen next year. Long term, I do think it is a $100B company, but I worry the public will catch on about what their business model is, but if Google is still around, i guess PLTR might not have a problem.

USD is backed by gold reserves as the world currency. You have to trade oil in USD. Oil trade is currently dead and will be decimated over the next 50 years. Now online currency‚Äôs are taking off too and that‚Äôs another competitor for USD. Now if you‚Äôre not aware the US government isn‚Äôt known for just laying down and letting power leave their hands. They will take over online currency and regulate it or they will destroy it. It‚Äôs a risky investment before that fact.

... In the realm of dating, often the most valuable dating partners will not  announce themselves with flashy attire and a perfectly orchestrated  smile. In fact, it's quite the opposite: those with a healthy  self-esteem usually don't feel the incessant need to announce their  greatest qualities upfront, because they are confident that all will be  revealed in time (they have a stable sense of worth). Perhaps we should  all give people more of a chance in the realm of dating and  relationships, and not mistake being reserved or even just quietly  confident as a lack of self-esteem.

Let me put the offering issue in terms you might understand 


Say that My Little Pony releases a limited edition Rainbow Dash fuck toy. Only 100 will be made. 


You and your Brony friends all go wild for these and buy all 100. 


The My Little Pony company needs more cash to make a special, teledildonic Princess Sparkle pegging machine.  But nobody will give them the loans or investment to make this ultimate ass blaster. 


So what does the My Little Pony company do? They go back and rerelease that Rainbow Dash fuck toy. Now your jizz stained Rainbow Dash sitting in the bottom of your cum box is worth a lot less money.  


Your confidence in reinvesting in another ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù My Little Pony fuck toy is diminished because you‚Äôll never be certain if they can raise enough money or if they‚Äôll do something again to further devalue your spunk sullied equine shame hole. 


Friendship is magic.

Damn. He really slapped Elon with his dick huh
Yeah...fucking retards, you should tell those retards what the difference is by replying to this so they can see it
Shut up pussy hail paymen
Realistically if you just believe the dollar is gonna drop you would invest in a bunch of other currencies to diversify. You are betting against the dollar, not for any specific currency.
$BNTX is the better play rather than $PFE. They designed the vaccine, they own 50% of the gross profit despite being 1/10 the size of PFE, and the vaccine validates their entire technology platform (first-ever product they‚Äôve brought to market).
If you want leverage get the Australian dollar or the Canadian.

This is the real deal and has backings from some big tech companies. I have no doubt the outlook is bright and it might be tough to scale and grow their business exponentially. But they have a service that is a pioneer. I would buy and hold, and DCA if it dips since it had a high IPO.

This might be the stupidest question of all time, but if you were to buy a cheap stock with enough volume and sell long dated calls that were a higher price than the actual stock price, you can keep buying more shares, selling more calls as long as people keep buying them and just hold onto that stock for a few years and as long as the company doesn‚Äôt go bankrupt it would be insanely profitable. It‚Äôs the perfect scheme, right? It sounds so ridiculous but so smart at the same time? Idk maybe I‚Äôm just drunk and wanting to imagine myself becoming a millionaire

Thats just as high as I'm willing to go..i just feel like its the overhyped ipo of the year and thats saying a lot. I think they'll use the snowflake model ipo probably asking a completely over price knowing the hype is going to drive it up.

How are you getting only 18%?
Thought it was the other way around. Tesla was an AC current fan and Edison was a DC fan. Edison wanted DC power lines connecting to homes which ended up being a mess. Lots of cables involved.
imo this is why Elon is not afraid... Tesla after all is an American company, with American ingenuity. They implement change so fucking fast that Sandy munro is even shocked, xpeng stole their source code and then they just rewrote that shit within 12 months... and made it even better. CCP can copy all they want this is just like apple vs huawei/oppo/etc and Apple has destroyed them making their own chips... it would be funny though if one day we see Tesla phones/laptops... I dunno if Apple comes out with a car or not but they may be the only real competitors in the long run

Nobodies making people take them yet what‚Äôs the first question on an application or interview for any decent paying job in America? It shouldn‚Äôt be setup where you have to tear your ACL to get a tryout. It‚Äôs never been that way before. It wasn‚Äôt that way when the basketball team owners got their tryout. Right now there are two peasants talking on the internet discussing which peasant is at fault for being in debt exactly how the person who loaned the debt wants. The entire system top to bottom drained this generation at every turn. I know ZERO people who went to college, got a job in their degree, own a home and a car, started a family and are debt free. That was literally everyone in the generation before us. The question should be why is it so difficult to live a middle class life from one generations difference. Keeping 44.2m of the younger working class strapped with debt they will never get out from under working at these wages, paying these housing and food rates will only continue the separation of wealth.

Roblox is completely unique and probably the only well executed virtual world for teen crowd. There‚Äôs nothing else that really compares. And it‚Äôs become really popular. The marketplace element where you can create games and make money off them means there‚Äôs new fresh stuff all the time.

rest easy my fellow degenerates - this will not negatively impact our activities.

here's what they're proposing: a $0.0025 surtax per transaction on entities that make 10,000 or more transactions annually in NJ.

why would they want to do that?  to crush the high frequency trading algos that are gobbling up all your gains.

who benefits from such a tax?  everyone except operators of HFT algos.

will it work to pass it just in NJ?  fuck no.  i guess they're hoping NY will follow suit.

what's all this about it affecting people outside the state?  the authors claim that it will impact mutual finds and 401k managers in the state and those companies will pass that cost along to boomers with a tiny bit even higher of fees on their puny r/investing gains.  whatever.

My girlfriend and I spent a couple hours today making hot pockets from scratch and it's so much better than overpaying for those overpriced mass produced frozen snacks

Basic instructions are:

Make some flaky pastry dough

Peel your pepperoni off a fresh tube and chop it into cubes

Cook mini sausage meatballs

Make and cook quality pizza sauce

Stuff your pastry dough pockets with the above plus freshly grated/shredded mozzerella

Pre-bake your pockets until the dough is solid and cooked

Freeze your 2-3 dozen pockets for later and use a toaster oven to finish them off when you want one
Imagine that you work a job that has 2 weeks vacation a year. You work in your cubicle for 50 weeks a year and you spend half your vacation time to go on a fucking cruise, when you could do literally anything else. You pay $1,300 to not have to think for your self and still have to pay for booz.

Two reasons I don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúonline currency‚Äù. First scenerio, unlikely but plausible, 150 years ago a solar flare hit the earth strong enough to knockout power grids, satellite communications and internet. What happens while we try to repair all that? Second scenario a lot more likely, governments everywhere are becoming more and more restrictive with what‚Äôs allowed to be accessed on the internet. What happens when they start blocking/ shutting down access to ‚Äúonline currency‚Äù besides the one they‚Äôve created? All currency has always been regulated through government, this one won‚Äôt escape that either.
Pretty sure that‚Äôs what makes a market.

I think you should do DD on current state of their business then.

Their financials are misleading if you don't read between the lines.
Take for example their COGS on which they report 80% margin. They only consider R&D to be included in COGS.
Then they go on to spend almost all their money on "Sales and Marketing" but admit their new account management/sales team is only 3% of headcount? So what the fuck is up here?
Answer is they attribute their "forward deployed engineers" under sales and marketing instead so they can be exempted from COGS.
This is stupidly misleading as software licensing doesn't make up the bulk of their revenue, services contracts i.e FDEs do.

Their valuation being fair is contingent on this changing, elimination of the reliance on FDEs for both implementation and revenue, transition to a more traditional sales team and better product packaging and onramp so it doesn't take a year+ for new customers to get onboarded.
Dude my buddy posted about it, the bar was asking people to please come for takeout because it was a family business that needed help during lockdown. 

I still think the price was a mistake so I‚Äôm going to call them about it but at the very least those were some incredibly strong margs.

We can do takeout alc from bars here since we‚Äôre locked down. They changed the rules in March during lockdown 1.

In response to your edit, I'll tell you how this falls apart.  They won't moderate it at all, and it will be a hate group recruitment tool, and the first time a shooting or Q Anon terror plot or something gets organized on it and (hopefully) gets broken up by the FBI, the government will shut it down or force it to become its own antithesis. 

Social media platforms are held accountable for the content that gets posted by its users.  If Parler is effectively pledging to be an echo chamber for hateful bullshit, it's gonna have a bad time.

do you believe a fetus that is almost nearly a baby at 11 months should be ripped out of a mother's body and killed via abortion? I don't. As for God, absolutely yes, I think God should be everywhere in our lives. Those that are offended by the words "under God" in our national songs need to look in the mirror and realize that the problem lies within themselves. As for guns, that is one area where I stand with the Democrats but I do not believe the Dems have any capability of crafting and passing any legislation to remove guns off of our streets - they never have and they never will as long as they continue to be the incompetent Democratic party. Instead they just use false promises like "remove guns from our society" and never deliver. I think our police are absolute studs and I stand with them 100% for keeping us safe and risking their lives on a daily basis. I do not think they use force too quickly - the problem lies in criminals refusing arrest. They are the problem. Yes, I believe in stimulus but President Trump was all for a big stimulus - all indications are that Pelosi didn't negotiate in good faith in fear of giving Trump a victory before the election - shame on her for putting people's lives on the line for her political selfishness.  We do have immigration pathways. Do you believe in open borders where anyone and everyone can come into the country? Where a pregnant mother will do anything and everything she can to make sure her child is born in the US to guarantee citizenship and a lifetime of government benefits for the child and her? Do you believe that people who work hard to meet all of the requirements of US citizenship should be denied because of the massive amount of illegal immigration that takes their spot? Do you believe in democratic cities that purposefully break the US laws and call themselves sanctuary cities? I applaud for President Trump for working hard to address the issue. 

This is why I think you are brainwashed - all of your positions are media talking points from left wing media. Trust me, I said the exact same things as you did before I became educated on the issues. The Democrats are highly manipulative and full of incompetence. It doesn't meant the Republicans are great and I am more of a moderate but I can tell you that the Democrat party has no clue what it is doing and it is very dangerous. And as long as they continue to bring in these airheads like AOC, Omar, the Georgia runoff guy, Yang, they will continue to seduce the masses with impossible promises like "universal income" and "free tuition" and "immigration for all with compassion" and on and on. These are stupid people and those that are following them are stupider. You want to follow these people? Look up the Jonestown massacre - that is where they will lead you too - a socialist utopia that results in massive disaster.

bro no matter what happened, you don't talk about the woman that gave birth to you like this
I read through the other comments, and I think there's a couple of things to consider:

1) GM isn't as behind as you think.  They've been doing the R&D.  The Bolt had the longest range behind Tesla consistently for the past 5 years or so.  Was it fucking ugly and too utilitarian?  Of course.  But that's the past, not GM's future.  As for software, GM's supercruise is rated at or above Tesla's autopilot by several car mags.  The tech is there.  What GM has been lacking is a commitment to build a business plan around it.  That's what they're emphasizing now.  Which leads you to:

2) Institutional FOMO.   The street is falling in love with GM.  Guys like Josh Brown on CNBC's Halftime Report that were mocking it a couple of months ago are now pounding the table over it.  Many of them missed the boat on Tesla, and they see this is the next chance to take that ride.  They see GM using their industrial might to be able to mass produce cars and market them, service them, etc in a way Tesla just can't.  Quibble with that if you will, but real money that still won't touch Tesla can see investable valuations in GM, and they're now pouring in.

It doesn't have to be either/or.  Tesla's valuation scares the hell out of me given the number of competitors that will come online next year, but I'm holding 100 shares and 1 Dec 420 call for whatever's left of the S&P run.  But I've also got 20 GM Dec 45 calls as well.   I think the market may have a rough week next week, but I think the timing of these gets us into Santa Claus rally, and I expect GM to be a beneficiary alongside Tesla running up to Christmas. 

PS, I look forward to earning some theta from a couple of you for the next few weeks.

You still hold the underlying at 20% lower than what you got it for. Would u sell at a lower strike and risk getting assigned at under what you paid? Would you sell so far out that you don‚Äôt make much at all? 

Guess you can just sell puts/ average down and just wait it out but this could also go south.

My friend posted on Facebook about a bar doing take out drinks while bars are closed here. I ordered two margs and paid and didn‚Äôt check the bill. Got home and saw the margs were 80$ So I guess 40 a pop. Obviously i thought this was an error since how is a marg $80. Ate dinner and drank the marg. First sip felt it after a few mins. Got super drunk off it, now I feel like shit.

Read the article out of boredom. Apparently he's been calling for a crash for 2 years straight and also predicted a crash in 2014. However, he claims to have correctly predicted the dotcom bubble bursting and the exact amount the NASDAQ lost.

I mean he's right. We'd honestly be fools to think that we're in the beginnings of a 50 year bull run. Valuations are high and blah blah blah and the right combination of factors or external events will trigger a rug pull one day, but nobody knows that shit.

There‚Äôs no 80-20% gap comparison on this scale. The 99% are sand on a beach and the 1% are the sun. ‚ÄúReasonable poor folk‚Äù who wanted to get an education so they could have a shot at a better life shouldn‚Äôt have to take on 80k of debt at 7% rates to do so. Everyone‚Äôs got such backwards thinking about what has happened in this country the last twenty years. Nothings ever going to change when poor people resent other poor people. It‚Äôs insane how that narrative got stamped in and everyone fights each other over scraps and blames each other for why things are so tough. I love hearing the welfare, food stamps, hud peasants are the reason I have it so bad I hope they enjoy my taxes. Billionaires have accumulated over $637b since covid started and everyone not in that 1% got $1200. ‚ÄúReasonable poor folk‚Äù should resent that not the fact that someone went to college to get educated and extorted for doing so.
Not a year. 6 months so far. We‚Äôll see what happens in a year. Hopefully for the best

How do we figure out fair value on the SPAC shares? They‚Äôre projecting revenue of $334 million in 2024.

The deal is supposed to be $1.5b & the SPAC accounts for 20% of shares at $10. I wouldn‚Äôt want to keep holding at say 15x future rev.
That's...like your opinion, man.

Get out of your own fucking head - chicks are a bit more complicated than dudes and they vary pretty widely from *will fuck you if it means I get nice things* all the way to *I know he's ugly, fat, and has a small dick, but I love him for who he is.*

If you are like super ugly, like there is something medically that went wrong and caused you some crazy look then you gotta work that personality hard. Figure out who you are, what you love, and then be.

If the ones you're around don't like you for that, you're around the wrong people. As SmittySomething says, confidence matters - if you were making $500k/yr you'd probably feel like you are a badass and that is probably what attracts women to dudes with money as much as the *stuff*.

In finance, a class A share refers to a share classification of common or preferred stock that typically has enhanced benefits with respect to dividends, asset sales, or voting rights compared to Class B or Class C shares. There may be restrictions on any specific issue of class A shares in exchange for the benefits; for example, preferences with regard to dividends may be traded for reduced voting rights.

You‚Äôre setting a maximum on your gains in exchange for a small guaranteed premium. 

The problem is that you‚Äôre carrying all the downside risk of holding a stock, but limiting the upside. So if your stock tanks, you‚Äôre holding it and you take the loss. But if a stock beats earnings and shoots up 25%, your gain is limited to ~5% (or whatever you chose).
