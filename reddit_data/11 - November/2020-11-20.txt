This is great. At the same time, you've revealed your hand--no way this is blowing upward. The MMs have restricted selling because retards gonna keep piling on meme stocks, but the pressure is building and all it's going to take is the slightest catalyst between now and January and they're going to sell, sell, sell. Time to load up on VIX calls, amirite?

You just explained my trading “strategy”. Buy too early/late and sell too early/late. I got fucked hard from selling too early last week. I can’t recover from that play until I insert more coins.
This is the way...
Hard to say. Lots of news coming out on them recently.  Finally settled a lawsuit for under estimated settlements and that helped the stock this past week. Investors don't like uncertainty. There are some cheap contracts out there, you might be able to pull one off.

Most "expert" do over estimate. - Paul Krugman (Noble Prize economist) .
For a real reply, it's because of some potential massive sell-off. Certain shareholders  (I think it's employees who received share compensation) will be able to sell their shares beginning EOY without the SEC's cock down their throats.

Yep.. oil stocks are fucking junk. The main argument (mostly by bagholders) is that "everything is still going to need oil to work" yeah but the stock market is obviously going to apply a heavy ass motherfucking discount if it knows the business won't be around in 15 years.. yeah 15 years is a long time but also, it IS already priced in. Basically, the shift to green energy is already priced in.. unless the market ends up being wrong.. but the market tends to call shit the right way most of the time. Market already knew Biden won on election night when NDX rallied 4 fucking percent!!
High volume low pressure

good lord that IV today on ideanomics was fun, I wrote a bunch of puts and sold some covered calls at 1.5 and 2 for 12/18
u/GiraffeGrad just curious do you believe the stock would actually go above 35? I like ackman but just wanted your take as I like the play.
damn u sound like me in march. unfortunately i lost it all.
AAPL 11/27 @ 120c Avg: 0.7

Am I printing? Only reason I bought cause the IV was so low lol.
PLTR @ $15 0% off next week
Yes.
Dude get some sleep and don’t sell your blue chips. Lol
100% was pre-covid... now it’s 232%.... and it’s only that low because they can’t make it fast enough, they bought 2 more factories and doubled the shifts, and they still can’t make enough. Their back orders filled all of 2021... they haven’t even released their cheaper treadmill yet. They haven’t even expanded beyond US and a couple of European countries yet. At home fitness is a growing trend, even Apple invested heavily into Apple One. So don’t give me your uneducated tard rant ever again

Sell monthly high premium OTM covered calls and keep collecting until you get called away enough to reduce your portfolio allocation to 10%. It's a good looking chart, but there are always other opportunities in the market. 

You real advantage of the ESPP is gone, so just another position now. 

Don't sell just because you want to reduce to 10% allocation.
That's going to start bubbling up soon.

I see people use the same attacks on Elon saying he’s an idiot because he doesn’t literally build the cars himself and he has other people do the technical stuff. They’re Monday morning quarterbacks who after a great new product comes out say “oh yea, I would have thought of that” after the fact. 

It’s the common attack for any successful businessman. The idea that every CEO just sits at his desk doing absolutely nothing while raking in money because he has connections and literally anyone can do their job. It’s just a big cope for losers who get nowhere in life. Most CEOs don’t have a life outside work. Their job is 24/7, they don’t get their personal time every night where they can plan to watch TV like most of us do.
whats your secret sauce you fucking retard, SPEAK! I need to eat I'm one play away from being homeless.
I honestly had no idea peeing in the shower was considered weird until I went to college. Did it all the time growing up. Never thought anything of it.
I feel like tech dropped when they started announcing vaccine stuff and people moved money to other shit but if we lockdown again the money goes back to tech. But I’m also a retard and don’t know shit
Not like I was trying to get it, took all precautions and still got it.  Buddy's parent are retired and live in rural area took precautions and very minimal contact with people because of their health problems but still got it.

TA isn't one "thing" but rather a collection of things. there's various forms of TA. some are better for certain trading styles than others.

also some types of data isn't free and thus not public. also TA itself can be interpreted in different ways. some ppl are more skilled than others.

so to price it in you'd need to factor in all of the forms of it, all of the private data, and all of the interpretations. it's pretty much fucking impossible.
I'm drinking so much water from tomorrow on. I think dehydration is the worst for me....and my hair!!!!
Wsb is literally the best free one on the internet. 1.5 million users with one of the highest active user bases on Reddit. Paralleled only by even more retarded subs like r/unpopularopinion and r/amitheasshole where you can literally get banned for calling someone an asshole. (Ask me how I know this)

They talk about some really volatile stocks here. Most of them green but there is a good chunk of stocks that are spoken about here, that are very shortable. 

Don't take any advice in which you read on this sub, but certainly take information from it. Why pay for one of those services when some fucking cuck here will share the information for free so he can get some karma?
Does tracking OI make a difference? I’m having a revelation in my head that it does. It’s a vicious cycle. If MMs create more contracts, and for each contract created someone has to buy 100 shares, this drives stock volume and pricing and tempts more MMs to make even more contracts.  So tracking OI and following spikes in MMs option creating means more stock action in the same direction
Remember that one of the Palantir's first investors was In-Q-Tel, the venture capital branch of the CIA. And that Peter Thiel, a brilliant guy in his own right, and the first investor in Facebook, and a close friend of Elon Musk, owns most shares. The sky is the limit.

Energy stocks folks, what's the consensus? I mean precisely, are they cheap relative to the future of energy? relative to what? i think even at current levels they are not undervalued.. they are more or less fairly valued if the future truly is pivoting away from oil the way Wall St would have us believe.. Opinions? IMO oil stocks have been value traps for many years.. since 08 oil bubble popped basically..

I was the guy who sold very near the top today.  And also the same guy who bought the dip and proceeded to lose 10% of my gains before I cut bait.  

I will also be the guy watching closely on Monday for a good place to hop back in.
Its useful in identify patterns in the market using statiics and probability instead of measuring value that has been torpedoed by covid, propped back up by stimmy, and then completely disregarded by retail fomo, etc. But there are too many variables for something to 100% correct  and its just a tool

There's one thing that you're missing. Jack Ma vision is not spectacular. It's inevitable. It's either Jack or somebody else in China who would do the same. Jack Ma probably got an edge in convincing people. 

Case in point. Internet shopping is bound to happen because it's already proven working in the US, pioneered by several startups and eBay, then Amazon ebooks which became an online shopping juggernaut. So to replicate what's going on with online shopping, Jack Ma knew China was opening up and he just needs to replicate those things. 

Who's the biggest backer to Ma? Is it Steve Jobs? Is It some American company that foresee the vision for China? Of course not, it's Jerry Yang, Yahoo co-founder, who slingshot Jack Ma vision by recruiting all the CEOs, esp softbanks, the biggest venture in East Asia. 

What follows was not Jack Ma vision. It's China's protectionist policy that facilitate Alibaba growth. The same goes for Baidu, replicating Google. It's China protectionist that helps to nurture those companies growth, rather than founders **true vision**. 

The same can be said for India as well. If somebody in India implement online shopping and India has protectionist policy, they would have somebody too. It's not vision per se. It's the inevitable and country policy. But India is entangled with those H1B visa opportunists and those indian CEOs of American companies, India cannot simply implement the national policy to ban American companies. Imagine giving 100 millions to Sundar Pichai and reaping 1.2 billion Indian markets, that's what stifle the homegrown version of Google in India. The same goes for Amazon as well. 

All those Indians proud of being top CEOs in American companies are oblivious to their home country markets and missing the forest for the trees. 

The bottom line is, original iPhone (mp3, internet, phone) is vision. But oneplus is not. 

I'd also say that wechat is vision in 21st century, but whatsapp is not.

Seattle is terrible. Very expensive, the worst city government in the entire country, and homeless people everywhere.

Options are valued based on multiple factors. Various options calculators on the internet should give you a good idea of how. 

The short of it is he has a good amount of time left til expiry, giving the option additional value based on the potential for additional gains. That is multiplied by implied volatility, a parameter that measures how wildly a stock is moving in either direction and how quickly. 

He has high IV long expiry options on stocks that have seen significant upward movement, and their value reflects that.
They have no idea about history of Soviet Union and why it doesn’t exist today anymore

Sold baba put last week and got ravaged. Thankfully I diamond handed it and it is back to being profitable. I would go hard with baba as long as they don't pull Luckin. Think I will sell a 14dte nvda put and 3month pltr monday.
I complained about the expiration date on my protein box at Starbucks, and they just gave it to me, so I gained $6.45. Big win.
all we have to do is find those who lose 100% of the time and inverse their moves, if any of the inversers are destined to lose, then the system will not be able to compute and.. you know, it’ll be interesting to watch

finally someone else said it
Relatively speaking: Short term, BABA, because it's down so much from where it's fairly valued. Medium term, PLTR because it's just a baby right now. No idea on ZM, it goes up and down, but it's basically Skype at the end of the day. NVDA and TSLR could go up a lot more in the long term. TQQQ, just no.
Damn when was this.
You sound like you have no idea what you’re talking about
sure i'll buy some

I'll listen to literally anything somebody tells me on this site

Don’t do it. I gave it up, came back for Forsaken...just don’t have the time for it anymore.
Nobody is gonna buy it, but putting that aside your money is stuck since the bid ask will probably be wide if you want to buy to close.

wish i saw this post earlier, but it would be great to get in early for Affirm, the thing is, can't the SPAC issue / dilute the shares at will? so it lists, to get all the legal stuff out of the way, but then when it gets taken over / transffered to affirm it could lets say issue another million stocks and then say for everything bought prior you would be condensed to having like 1% of the value of Affirm? 

Just trying to see how this behavior would be different compared to lets say newegg which is doing a merger with a cheap 50mil mkt cap company to be listed. which did a similar offer.

I disagree. I don't know about you, but I've never heard of a PE agreeing to a price, then folding to angry investors and raising their bid. They should walk away, not raise their bid and set a precedent for every future bid to be a disaster. It's totally possible, obviously, but I imagine they're a lot smarter than sending that kind of message.
Bro how are you so eloquent? Lmaooooooo you are the voice of my generation

Once I can order a ps5 I feel like I'm gonna spend more on the internal SSD upgrade than the system itself. Assuming Sony starts greenlighting cards sometime next year.

Should I sell 12k worth of 0.5p Jan, 21, 2023 SOLO. 
Would collect 25 dollars for each spread with a maximum collateral of 50 dollars per spread. So theoretically if I collected 12.5k worth of premium, I would risk 12.5k (not including premium) What’s your thoughts theta gang?

Thanks. I dropped it and there were some dead pixels on the screen but there's no visible damage or scratches. I just told the support rep over chat that it got dead pixels all the sudden.

Last week I locked myself in my car and my computer was in the house with my keys, I was stuck in there till 3 hours after closing bell until my neighbour saw me and let me out. When checked my account all my FDs had won and I felt like such a retard I vowed never to post about it here. So don't feel bad you're not alone. Here's hoping your luck changes for the better.
When TSLA first started its original runup I jokingly looked at strikes I could afford ($100) and laughed at how far OTM it was. End of the week it would have been 15k

Yeah the delima I am getting over is I stopped averaging down my calls for Jan and just started buying 22 and 23 leaps and it goes and drops nearly a dollar. The whole idea was to sell the 7 and 10 calls when it got 5.30ish to 6 and then use the funds from those 80ish contracts to exercise the 5 5calls and start running the wheel on 600 shares I would then have. Butttttt here we are so I guess we shall see. Thought it was a good idea if it worked and a fun way to grow a sub 5k account.

I mean that’s a good deal, only needs to go 12% in a month.  Tesla did like 500% in 10 months, so expect to see about 50% growth next month.  The call will be worth 25-30k

The reality is that not everyone will be able to get it.

After that the rest of the public will be lining up for nothing.  
That's also ignoring the logistical miracle that will need to take place to get that far.  
Once reality sets in and people start to grasp the understanding that they are not actually important enough to get, "priority."

Let them, I read enough books on the oil industry to know what I’m talking about. I bet most oil execs from the 60’s are disillusioned. My grandfather worked for Shell in Saudia-Arabia, Indonesia among other places. He is in disbelief governments are still subsidising companies.

I mean, he disagrees about Nigeria for example, those were just different times. He has shown me pictures of the Shell guards shooting negro’s for demolishing the pipes. Lined up and blinded, bullet to the head. But subsidising and giving tax-breaks in 2020, get the fuck out of here.

I figured the china sentiment was going to stick through and be more of a issue. I also so really good results with their D.O.D testing they were doing in Texas setting speed records. I saw that they were down compared to Ericsson and figure if they kept landing massive contracts then they had more room to grow and a larger upside potential. Plus  at the time I had gotten shares for 2.83 a few weeks earlier to hedge a stack of so puts I was going deep on. I had 5calls that missed my sell order by 2 cents when it finally climbed up around 5.16 and I had alot of hope it would keep climbing.

Cool, thanks for sharing. Wishing you luck. DD seems pretty decent, but I'm a bit of a newb so everything seems enticing. The contracts do seem pretty cheap though. 

What's your feeling on when it may pop?
what kinda guy is your type
Or he could end up with 20k. We don't know what is to come.
take the gains, then put a little bit back in

if it dips, you didn't lose everything

if it moons, you didn't miss out

You know it ;)
Nah, he’s still bullish on GME. He may have had his shares called away from selling covered calls. Also he technically still has more money in GME than before, just less shares

Both parties are the “going to war” parties. Both parties have interests in continuing wars, however during Obama administration the US was at its peak involved in conflicts in 8 different countries, the most in our history. During Trumps presidency the military was less directly active however he expanded the already large drone program. I would imagine under Biden’s administration he would follow along the same path as his former running mate. I try to be unbiased and I am not a fan of Trump or Biden but the world is the way it is. The US has been a part of decimating the Middle East for years under both democratic and republican leadership (of course there are many other factors) so please don’t be naive about what an administration is capable of because “he seems like a nice guy”.
Excellent! And I hate you.
I would say 20% if you consider asymptomatic cases and people who couldn't be bothered to get tested (nose swab phobia, long testing line, covid denier, etc)

Sold a bunch of pltr monthly cc’s couple days ago, my puts didn’t hit the limit sell today but if we’re down I’ll try next week. Good money in it
Careful, some retard is gonna call you a commie for saying that lol
YOU PUNCH THAT SHIT. FUK DEPRESSION
Better than being a retard who invests in the hospitality industry 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Even if you got it for pennies you prolly 

Did it post bailout loans.

Locations/neighborhoods weigh heavily on hospitality businesses so assuming you bought a venue that was atleast forclosed on that probably had reason for the venue being forsale.

Invested in one of the only industries still forced to function at half productivity. Manufacturing, IT, Construction, Clerical, Drafting, engineering, procurement fuck there's endless list of businesses to start that require waaaay less work, risk, investment and time than hospitality. 

Even if the vaccine comes out licketty split, has overwhelming success, is manufactured at herd immunity levels of volume, its going to be a fuck of a long time before gatherings are back to un restricted status. So basically you invested in something that is guaranteed not to match its value it was leading up to it being sold.

As a venue owner, you will be one fucking slip up to be shut down for non compliance, one negligible employee from being shut down, one fuckin sneeze from being shut down. 

Please tell me how much of an idiot I am 😘
If spy opens at 360. That’s a ten bagger for some strikes

Yes, also remember that all chinese stock listings are through VEB’s. CCP can literally cancel your ownership at will. Just few days ago Raytheon guy got sent to prison for espionage, I personally feel US, EU, Canada and India should get the fuck along and start uniting as a front against these guys. Up the cyber warfare budget and give them a taste of their own medicine, avoid “real” war at all costs.

What the fuck are you talking about? Social safety nets are far, far greater in Spain, just like pretty much all of Western Europe. It’s why they don’t have the same level of crippling poverty we have over here, even with such a shitty economy.

Okay gang. Do you think the market will care once us starts seeing daily case numbers in 300k or higher this dec?
And when do you think this wil plateau? I think a lot more people got infected and recovered than the case number shows, and soon the virus will run out of people to infect.

Positions or ban
Enjoyed your writing ! Keep it coming bro
Never love a bitch

Love yo issue, love yo non-negotiables, love yo list of demands. If she falls in line with yo issue, how could you not love that?
If she doesn’t fall in line with yo issue, how the fuck could you love that?

Engage her mind, be a great question asker and listener. Don’t be a bitch ass complainer. About anything. Always optimistic and confident. Even if you gotta fake it. Bitches need that energy. 

Fuck her like you’re fresh outta jail. Sex is 100% about pleasing her, but you gotta be aggressive and dominant and make her think you’re all about using her body for your pleasure. 

Keep that jealously shit to yourself. Never be a chill pill. If that bitch wants to go out on the weekend and suck cock...oh well🤷🏽‍♂️. If the bitch fall in line with yo issue, fine. So what? You don’t turn down stock that other people profit off too, do you? Of course not. As long as you get what you want everything else is chewed up grass.

Also, don’t make yo issue easy. I demand mind, body, soul, and money from my bitches. Funny thing is, I really don’t give a fuck if they get outside dick, but they never want to. When you get a bitch to invest that type of time, energy, and effort into you she don’t want to cheat. She wanna be in yo presence. She want return on investment.

Recap: don’t be needy, ever. Never make her feel guilty, ever. That’s coward shit. Be the laid back player. Remember, people will forget shit you do, and shit you say, but they’ll never ever ever forget how you make them feel...

Make her feel good. Mind, body, and soul. Be a light in her world. And be willing to let the bitch walk if she don’t get down with yo issue. End it respectfully as friends. Bitches hate that, she’ll never let you go if you make her feel good and you’re confident enough to stick to yo morals and standards.

You gotta fuck her good tho, or this advice ain’t gone work young bruh.
what sucks about LUMN is it pays a decent dividend so growth isnt really there

What's the update on Michael Burry? Did he quit holding?
You guys gotta chill like OP says, this shit will be at 35 next year. I hate when my friend calls me on the phone when NIO dips 1% or some shit like OH IM DOWN $8 chill & shut the fuck up. Don't wait for some bullshit to dip to buy it when the market keeps going up, just fucking BUY IT.
As long as the hustle makes me money i don’t care if the underlying company is fake as fuck
You are definitely going to go broke trying because one of those is investing and the other is not. But luck to ya mate

I have a theory that every light beer essentialy uses the same recipe but is marketed to different demographics.

pbr- hipsters

coors- people who wish they were hiking more

corona- people who wish they were at the beach more

bud- people who want 1 "beer"

I buy a couple pf shares when it dips. Its free money lads
I’m praying for a dip on Monday so I can get into the 12/18 25 calls cheaper 

Maybe not as crazy but def has room to go imo
Haha why? I just noticed we had a few red days this week a few minutes ago, been so focused on gme and crsr lol. Some kind of catalyst or just time for green?
The problem here is with the usage of the word "we".. someone designed and built them. "We" just use them.
I’m so glad there are people way smarter than I am
Peak.peak x peak^peak
It takes scientific notation to express the excellence of this post
exactly

any retard can buy the dip until it eventually blows up in their face

it takes balls and brains to time pullbacks, and you get to drink rivers of tears when shit goes deep red for days
Thank you
You might be broku
Shit happens. I get money.
Is she hot tho
What’s the take on Vix being red today? ELI5
More words = more gooder DD
Then close the one with the highest total value if you’re planning to reinvest.

Another small consideration is closing the one with the least liquidity cause you figure spreads will only widen the deeper ITM you go.

Lol. 2019: They’re a shit company for spreading themselves too thin and not developing strong base in core markets first then expanding. (Exits markets to do exactly what everyone criticized them for not doing). 2020: They’re a shit company, look at all the markets they exited.

Well yea sometimes it works, but like i said, sometimes it doesn’t cuz of market volatility rn. Also you can’t rly trade based off these breaks of resistance and support for more than a few hours maybe even minutes, it changes very quickly

Immigration is another issue where Biden and Trump disagree. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up immigration law enforcement action and boosted funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the tune of $200 million, according to CNN. Biden has taken an oppositional approach to the immigration issue and plans to scale back enforcement activities, according to his website, joebiden.com. 

If Biden is elected, his policy shift could hurt defense contractors like Palantir Technologies, which helps ICE conduct surveillance and compile evidence against undocumented migrants. Palantir has two contracts with ICE -- one for the agency's Investigative Case Management (ICM) system and the other for FALCON,controversial software that allows the organization to access sensitive information from other federal agencies. Together these contracts are worth as much as $92 million.

You kiss near her navel, and she laughs shyly. That's forbidden fruit. In ways, it's more forbidden than other parts of her. But you're allowed to partake. Because she trusts you, in spite of herself. The lights are on, after all.

Forbidden fruit. Like Apple should be. Your calls have bled for months. Bled. That's a generous description. It suggests there's blood to bleed. Apple is a zombie. Surviving on sheer will, on its hunger. But it knows it will never be alive again, no matter how much it eats.

She looks you in the eyes, and in those eyes you feel her commitment to you. You feel that she would do anything for you. You choke a tear out of your raisinated soul.

Haha yeah that is such BS. Anyone that read some oil history books knows that oil was well on their way in terms of tech, they just couldn’t turn a profit. 

If you look at the 100’s of billions and trillions spent on optimizing oil, to get at where we’re at now, you see that the thinking is just completely backwards.

If these oil companies would just spend their profits on R&D, I bet they would be live till 2100 and make a shit-ton extra in the long-run but they can’t cause’ management won’t get to cash their option incentive packages.

Biggest con of capitalism is people’s complete loss of anything resembling morals (in important positions), I ain’t no honest earl myself but I read the biography of some oil execs/founders from the early days of oil and goddamn, they would turn around in their graves. 

Crazy how far we have strayed from the “bible” in terms of capitalism if we look at Adam Smith for example. People still captured by snake-oil salesmen like Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman.

PLTR at $300 would make it a $500 billion company. It would be about the 7th biggest company in the world, very unrealistic. You guys need to stop looking at prices and look at market cap. Just because a stock has a price in the teens does not mean it’s a cheap company.

I hear u but I’m only trying to secure profit to reinvest and I’m not doing this for risk mitigation. Basically my question is the best way to exit partially on the position while maximizing my profit potential for the initial investment. 2/3 of my them are in the money as of today and I want to let the last one run. I’m only looking to exit on this position assuming that it will rally on Monday

Magic 8 ball says "seems unlikely"
Selling a covered call limits your upside. Flip side, it can absorb some losses, and/or generate money when it’s trading flat.

If next week it hits $25/share I only get profits to $23/share + $1.75/share premium. Basically, I make money until $24.75 if I get assigned. If it hits $23/share and I get assigned, I’ll just sell puts on it. Make money off gay bears and all.

BABA dip play. Had to average down 2x and managed to scoop another $45k worth of shares at $253.30 to bring my average price down reasonably. Also grabbed the calls to double down on it recovering as I can afford to risk that much capital with the shares being very safe.

And what the fuck does socialism mean these days anyway? I haven’t seen any real socialism in the US yet, and I don’f think there ever will be.

I dont know nothin, all i know is the money nigga
> Trump has shown that; two peace deals between Jews and Arabs even after recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel AND most all of the troops have come home or are on their way.

he just left his allies (on the eu and the kurds) on their own, midconflict (the conflicts never ended after the us left, if anything, he just left the wars to be proxy wars of turkey vs russia and another one popped off in naghorno kharabak). him leaving the region ammounted to nothing, it just made the region even more unstable. just like what will happen in afheganistan, where as soon as the us leaves the taliban will take over the country again. 

>wo peace deals between Jews and Arabs even after recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel AND 

they are hardly peace deals, as they are amongst countries that weren't even at war. and seriously, sudan, uae and bahrain are absolutely irrelevant, all things considered, countries that have common enemies with israel. this is not even close to as relevant as trump fans try to imply it is.

>Don't be fooled by this "abandoning our allies" nonsense; it is unsubstantiated.

its hilarious how confident you guys are in spite of being so unknowledgeable on the subject, lol. the us gains significantly more than those countries by their good relations, and those alliances only exist in those terms because they were forged in times of war (and won't easily be put together again, if broken, in times of peace), when the us was their only hope and had huge bargaining power. having military bases all around the world, the freedom to move troops and to put atomic weapons on foreign territory, right on the border of their enemies is a power that can't ever be measured in monetary terms. china and russia would give everything they have for similar freedoms - and trump constantly risked them. not to mention how good for the US is the use of the dollar as the tool to do international business, something that could be threatened by europe if they wanted. you follow the same retarded logic that trump follows that geopolitics are a zero sum game, where if europe is winning by avoiding conducting war on their own america is necessarily losing - when in fact, both sides win, as america mantains its position as leader of the free world, an hegemon through supremacy of the dollar, almost automatic allignement of european powers in international matters, and remains the greatest military power on earth; while europe has the security of a much more powerful ally protecting them from middle-east instability and russian aggresion. if the us leaves europe on their own to develop their own military safety, europe is going to be much harsher on america positioning troops there, will be much more egoistical on the geopolitical chess and in international institutions, and will look for money and safety elsewhere. 

> it lets them funnel billions into Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed.

> Bet you can't guess which 3 defense stock every member of congress owns?

mantaining military supremacy is what secures international trade, the high living standards of the american people, and the power of the dollar. you don't want to see raytheon boeing and lockheed being weaker than their chinese or russian counterparts.

[to be pedagogic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhMAt3BluAU) people don't hate trump because of his twitter feed, people hate trump because he has a shallow, uneducated worldview that would set america into a path to irrelevance that connects well with shallow, uneducated people. his twitter feed is just a window into his absolutely shitty brain.

Right, that'll be the end of Q4, and the start of Q1 but it specifies released AFTER Q4 results are published. They don't publish those results right away. I'm sure its not good for investors and current share holders tho. That said Finviz lists most of these shares already outstanding so I don't know what to make of it.

Daily COVID update:

Told ya'll last week I was still really bullish. CVID saw more steady gains today, closing just over 201k new cases. Deaths continue to be a bright spot as well, edging just over 1900, beating analysts estimates by 10%. I'd hoped we could hit 2k today, but it looks like we entered an area of possible resistance.

I'm still bullish, but RSI indicates CVID's been in the overbought zone for a while and faces increasing headwinds in the form of vaccines and advice from medical experts. Some analysts also show concern that future growth will slow due to a ceiling of 330 million max infections.

Year to date SPY is up 9% and USD is down 6% compared to EUR. Accounting for 2% inflation your real return is 1%. 
Year to date Nikkei 225 (Japan’s index) is up 10% and JPY is down 1% compared to EUR. Accounting for 2% inflation your real return is 7%.
As you can see, USD devaluation will cause money to flow from the US market into places like Japan because the real return is much higher.

Congratulations on your $1,731. Don't spend it all in one place!
everything is gay
you could also sell way OTM call for the same expiry on all of em.
Lol that’s a no.
Mods = SEC as far as I'm concerned
Dude it's not gay to suck dick
I have puts and even I think theres like a 90% chance theres gumby stretched dicks all over the chart monday.
CGC has actually managed to stay up a bit after the post election high it had. Been fading back down though this week.
Shoot, if I see a profit at any point next week, id sell immediately
You should be trying to think of how to turn that 10k into 15-20k. Then you can start thinking about how to turn that 20k into 30-50k. Then 100k. ETC.

10,000 into 100,000,000 would require a 10,000 bagger. You would have to buy far OTM calls on a penny stock and then hit the lottery on a black swan event.

Beautifully said. And good point, I have been curious about ways to make smaller, recurring gains with a larger foundation vs larger returns with less cash. I appreciate all the tips, as I'll be the first to admit that I've got plenty left to learn.
Mmm...tough question.
Yes please
Can you imagine the set of balls it must’ve taken the retard at Snapchat to turn down $3 billion from the Zuck?

I know it might be crazy, but I could see this administration intentionally making decisions that cause economic havoc and Devestation in a desire to spite the incoming administration. They have that lack of maturity.

Good shit man 😊
Doesn't account for the comically underpriced value of RKT.  It's a money printing machine.  Nets BILLIONS in profit every quarter.  Very few companies do that.  Even a small rate increase won't prevent this beast from printing money.  Very little overhead, no real supply chain issues, just raking in cash.  This is a $50 stonk.
Are you not going to debunk that metric>? look up warren buffet indicator

I'm actually a programmer and this isn't true. Look at evolutionary computation for example. Computers can actually evolve the solution and frequently do find solutions that a human couldn't. There is nothing magical about what we do. We are also just biological machines. Computers easily best us in many ways. In many not yet. But a generic statement like humans can't create something "smarter" is false.
Is there any daily table we can see? That would be helpful.

At the start yes, but after continuous devaluation it’s not. Big money will flow to other markets because even if their stock returns are slightly lower, the exchange rates will mean larger gains in USD terms.

People use calls for leverage here mainly because of low capital. A call represents 100 shares but you have to pay a premium for that. With a million dollar account you don't really need to use calls to make meaningful gains.

So funny since I was listening to the call as it was happening. I was baffled by the fact that CEO was pushing this deal. If Sanjay and others didn't get on his case I sure would have. This deal is not going through. No way no how. They won't get even 10% approval. There is going to be fights to replace the CEO and the board soon.

Went there last year on vacation. If I ever get rich enough to live from interest, I’m gonna move to Marathon TX, the pure serenity there made my heart beat 20 beats slower. 

Me and my dad were talking Dutch up there, getting looks from the local. We were heading for Big Bend, god , never seen so much freedom and so much open space. I suddenly understood why these people hate Washington imposing laws on them (although they would probably be helped by them), this is an empty bloc of space and it’s fucking theirs. 

I bet if you don’t fill yourself up with Murican junkfood and can pay for good healthcare, you get to live to at least 90 in that part of the US. As a European from a densely populated country, I just feel calm when I see this from the front-seat: https://i.imgur.com/5loxnIP.jpg. 

I think I had never seen an empty highway like that during daytime in my entire life. This year I’m hitting Colorado, driving all the way up to Jackson Hole, WY (gotta say hello to the Fed). You country got it all, shame there are some disturbances that fuck up liveability. Only would move if I would know to be and stay rich.
I need a way to combat the "no way they do that again tomorrow" mentality

Shares. I want to say it was on the nkla IPO hype so I just googled stuff like “EV company”. Made a quick 100% on SOLO and PLUG and never looked back. Obviously left a lot on the table but it was so fast I just took profit. 

Same thing happened with FCEL this week. I sold half up 100% in just a few days. I just stumbled on that and it was in a tight range so obvious place to throw a stop in. Just got lucky with that one.

how about 3 weeks and 100%

I'm in SBE, PLTR
“Poor people impress by what they wear— clothes, bling, etc. That is because they cannot afford to display in any other way.

Middle class people impress by what they drive— A trendy car, or maybe a boat or a bunch of motorized “toys” like four wheelers. They can afford the “bling” but don’t want to look poor. However, they can’t afford to radically change their lifestyle to show off.

Upper Middle Class and Wealthy people impress by either where they live or where they go— Some live in nice show houses in trendy neighborhoods. Some are the “millionaire next door” types that live in a regular house, but take a trip to Europe or the Amazon each year. Having an expensive car won’t impress any of their neighbors but they can’t afford to have a college named after them.

Very wealthy people try to impress by what they do. The wealthiest like to have buildings named after them, like Carnegie Hall or the Geffen School of Medicine. Think about it. What could Bill Gates or Warren Buffet wear or drive that would make anyone more impressed. Help develop internet access for all the libraries in the US (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) or buy ABC Television and General Motors (Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway) and you have something.

There are some theorists that say this effect actually works in the other direction. Poor people stay poor because they spend money on “bling” instead of saving for a decent vehicle. The trendy vehicles the middle class drive are usually too expensive, lose value and are bought with interest payments. This actually stops the middle class from becoming wealthy. The Upper Middle Class and Wealthy people end up spending too much in upkeep and property taxes on their homes. These people would say that the very wealthy became that way because they were not concerned about how other people see their clothes, vehicle and home and concentrate on doing important things.”

People here are saying it’s too late and I’m not so sure. 

AYRO exploded the last 2 days but it’s market cap is still a little less than 200M. 

To put that into perspective, even with all that growth it’s still 5x smaller than SOLO. 

It’s a risky play, but they have partnerships with guys like Ingersoll Rand and Karma that look to be big money plays in the future. Deal with Karma is to make 300M in cars by 2023.

It also isn’t competing with NIO or Tesla. They build short haul trucks for food, campuses, government /etc.

I’m schilling because I’m in on them long - but I genuinely see a lot of room to run left in this stock.  Check their investor stuff and read some of the other DD on here.

Not really that high. I just have high conviction on this play and have a long term hold mentality on this one. I also have a much smaller position in NIO ($40k @31) that I'm also planning on holding long term. Not really an options or a day trading type (I'm here for the laughs). I think PLTR is just getting started.
Moderna could apply for FDA emergency use or we could get an update on Phizer

If you want the security of a LEAPS, but more optimal profit... go with a June or September 2021. Maybe a $450c, but $500c is reasonable too. Be sure to have some capital to double down if TSLA gets back to 420. If so, have a couple LEAPS and sell some weekly $650 calls
MMEDF was up 15% again today. Shroom money is free money. Can’t wait till they list on Nasdaq. Available on TD and Etrade - still no RH though.
that’s what you assume but then ask yourself why banks pump during vaccine pumps... it’s because they expect increased rates
shit company

>However, I don’t know about the stimulus bill coming before late January, though, and we still might get jittery around the Covid aid expiration time in December

I agree. It could end up being flat. Vaccine approval is good, means economy opens up sooner, but no relief means people and business suffer. So, market can end up being flat until EOY. I think if vaccine passes, govt aggress on spending bill, and miraculously pass a bill that contains PPP, and UI extension I think we head higher.

I am a little nervous about the FDA meeting. If the vaccine is not approved, it’ll be terrible. But the odds are low, I think. 

You raise good points about rally into EOY, and I think it’s possible. However, I don’t know about the stimulus bill coming before late January, though, and we might still get a little jittery around the Covid aid expiration time in December. There are also going to be some mutual fund portfolio rebalancing, especially for funds holding 60/40 equities/bonds. We are talking about 160-300b in value. That’s a lot of money which can make things a little volatile. 

To be fair though, I really hope we can relax after September and October.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts though! This stuff is really interesting.

Texas > Nevada > New Hampshire > Tennessee

Just my opinion, but if you're relocating for tax purposes those are the top four, and Texas is the winner by a mile. Nevada has warm weather, Vegas, and is within a day trip of LA and Zion. New Hampshire is okay if you can tolerate the cold, and it's close to Montreal. Tennessee is cheap, central, and temperate. Also an above average number of red heads.

Posted this in response to someone else asking so the tone might sound aggressive but here...

Palantir designs data amalgamation software from the ground up for its clients, imbedding quite a bit of clever machine learning and artificial intelligence in that software. They hand the finished product over to their customer, they don't gate behind a shitty "products as a service" model. 

Companies have ASSLOADS of data piled onto different systems, and more often than not don't have a cohesive strategy or set of resources to pull it all into one place to create one grand scale picture of operational efficiency (or lack their of).

Palantir employs some of the best minds in the ML Big Data industry to build custom software that takes all that data and turns it into useful information on which more confident decisions can be made. Allowing companies to save large swathes of cash as Palantir customware points out all the stupid extra shit they're needlessly wasting money or time on and tells them where that can be put to better use. 

That's the enterprise side as I understand it. They have no moat, just a two decade head start, deep government contracts, and enough power behind their creations that it scares other players in their industry into virtue signaling disapproval of their methods because it's too fucking good at what it does.

>if you think the middle-east would be stable if not for american intervention,

This isn't a sub for politics, but you are right.

The middle east could have been stable BECAUSE of American intervention. Trump has shown that; two peace deals between Jews and Arabs even after recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel AND most all of the troops have come home or are on their way.

>the vacuums that trump is creating with his rushed abandomnent of allies

This is some bullshit that EU leaders are spouting because when American troops leave the EU leaders get three options:

1. Send their own troops in and have the political fallout (eurocucks hate wars)
2. Don't send their own troops in and have to deal with mass migration of people who follow a religion that explicitly forbids them from integrating into Western Society and the political fallout from that (Ever heard of Marine Le Pen? Nigel Farage? You think Trump is nationalistic? lmao he ain't got shit on those two!)
3. Pay Turkey to house any refugees and prevent them entering Europe

Currently the EU is paying a few milly a month so Turkey houses all the migrants.

Don't be fooled by this "abandoning our allies" nonsense; it is unsubstantiated.

The middle east is far more stable now than before Trump took office. Interestingly when you don't have tens of thousands of Americans on the ground and stop dropping bombs on people they end up sorting their shit out.

There are two reasons congress keeps authorizing bullshit "peacekeeping" missions and "wars" in the middle east: its far enough away from the US to not affect voters directly and **it lets them funnel billions into Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed.**

**Bet you can't guess which 3 defense stock every member of congress owns?**

Ahh serious? What would you recommend to invest in right now then
Hi Gary, it's me, your brother.

I read somewhere that Chinese companies sometimes hire white people to pose as executives when they negotiate with other Chinese companies to appear more sophisticated.
Palantir belongs to the "Enterprise software" section of the market. Most of those successful companies are valued at $100+, and quickly rocketed up in valuation. 

PLTR is founded by a very credible group, including Thiel.

I have high expectations it will be very successful, and valued by business as a required tool in analyzing any aspect of ROI.

Several companies have used their services and it lead to dramatic cost savings or increased operating efficiency. 

They have excellent customer retention as a result.


1x PLTR $35C 12/11 lotto ticket

1x PLTR $17.5 CSP 11/27

And contemplating some $35C Jan 2022, at ~$500 premium, which seems like the steal of a lifetime if this takes off the way other enterprise software has.
To be fair it looked real grim for awhile.  I had 355c 12/18s that I kept averaging down as it continued to dip.   Finally sold for $600 (80% loss) and yesterday I bought January 265cs with that and added to it. Today looked promising finally.  Probably time to get in if it continues.
It’s a reference to the sample, “Break da law” by Three 6 Mafia

Whatever happened to that guy
You’re playing the wrong game.
> If we fail to uphold ATHs now, there is going to be very little confidence in the markets.

This is true. Bulls failed to keep 360, and we are at 355 which is support from the looks of it, if buyers don't step in Monday we can fall quickly.


However, I do want to point out that:

>FDA sets Dec. 10 meeting to weigh Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine authorization

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/fda-said-to-plan-early-december-advisory-meetings-on-covid-19-vaccines.html

And the government needs to pass a bill by Dec 11th to avoid any shutdown, then they might even put in a small stimulus into the bill (highly unlikely). But let's say the data is good, budget passes, and we get a skinny stimulus. Wouldn't that move us higher for EOY close? I think FDA data alone can push us higher. What are your thoughts?

Yes.  This is the path to the dork side.
If a computer was smarter than a human it would create itself yet it relies on man to teach it what it should know.  It is only as smart as the person that created. So basically your calling your creator dumb and the computer smart when actually the computer and the person are both equally dumb at the same time. You guys keep pissing on each other. Elon may be smart as peanut butter on crackers. But jack ma didn't lift a finger.( WHOS SALTY NOW ) THEan leading with little skill or the one who knows alot but can't humble himself. You don't need to know everything you only need good people around you. Grow up. 🥺🥺🥺. It's like getting mad at the guy for coming on COD but his Kd is higher than yours and the pro player rage quits because he keeps getting shot from the same spot. Jack ma = camper / Elon musk = pro player lol 🤣🤣🤣

The thing with shitcoin that most onlookers miss, though so obvious, is that there's a mutually agreed upon movement. The movement is "hodlers" and it's like almost all participants are on the same quest.

I hired an excavator for $300. The trampoline needs a 15' diameter hole 36"+ deep. I was doing a landscaping project at the same time and needed to level out some ground so the excess dirt just coincidentally worked out. It took longer for the guy to unload the excavator than it did for him to dig the hole. I ended up with a 10ft tall mound of dirt, it was wild. I added 7 tons of clean 3/4 gravel in the hole to prevent any possible drainage issues. I haven't had any standing water issues.

It is super sick. I can tell the kids to go out on the trampoline and sit and watch them from inside. Being in ground, it doesn't look like shit and I don't have to mow under it or move it around.

All in all I think it cost $2300 for everything. 2 guys can knock it out in less than a day.

Trampoline is from Trampolines Down Under. Their prices have gone up due to crazy demand.
dont buy weeklies bro
Im not joking here if you take the real meaning of my words. Financial landscape is different between those days. Chart alone only explains how people play the market but not explain who play the market.

So I'm trying to get into option trading, though won't be doing it a ton, but I'd like to try a call option with PLTR. I'm pretty familiar with the terms used around options and the overall theory/strategy, but I'm not sure what exact numbers to put in for a call.

What does a 25c 12/4 call mean? 12/4 is the expiry but what is 25c? Is that the strike price? What would be a reasonable call for PLTR, knowing I'll just do one contract.
Imagine yoloing and pltr. Never again.
Lol wtf
Agreed. He/she should get banned
I think so. Shrooms have so many good properties to them for mental health and other shit
So shares
What are you talking about? I read today that it’s gonna hit 100k by end of the year. Wait no, 500k by next year. Oh wait another guy says it’ll hit $1million in 5 years
Because half the sub is leveraged to the tits in weeklies with 200% IV
At least they can diversify into cocaine and hookers.
That was how I yolod on pltr and got burnt

Not at all... Humans created that computer. Sure the computer can add and multiply numbers faster but a human designed the hardware that it runs on, the processes to create that hardware in a fab, and the machine code that runs on it.

You may not understand how it works, but the engineers over the past 50 years designed every single calculation that the conputer does. Sure, a computer can do math very quickly, but those its just following deterministic instructions that a human told it to do. Could a computer today do experiments and make enough scientific discoveries to be able to make a computer? Well, maybe in the future. Computers at the moment are just dumb machines that do exactly what people tell them to do.
Because the market is going to do whatever it does.

I wouldn't really buy into gamestop purely based on the idea that we might get a short squeeze.  Treat it as an investment in a severely undervalued turnaround story that could also happen to be a lotto ticket.

This type of thing has happened in other companies, but that type of short squeeze has not happened in GME before.  They do however, have a much calmer short squeeze every console cycle that usually runs the price up to about 60 (closer to 90 in today's world because 1/3 of the shares were bought back by the company since then).

&#x200B;

The share recall would only happen if Cohen made a buyout offer, or he pushed the company to oust the CEO and install him in that position.  Other votes wouldn't be significant enough for everyone to recall shares imo.  I can't really put a number on the % chance.  It seems likely based on what we know about cohen and his actions over the last few months, but buying in expecting that to happen is dangerous.
At least that call will print deep ITM. 🙂

Can confirm. I took a six figure loss almost ten years ago. I’ve used it to deduct $3K from income every year since. In my tax bracket, that equals getting back about $650 per year.

Finally, this year I turned it around and have six figures in gains. I will be able to use the remaining losses to offset almost all the tax.

Bottom line to OP: A big loss isn’t the end. You have balls. Add in the wisdom from your experience and you will prosper. Probably faster than me.
It's just ran up so much. Just some profit taking, it's gonna continue to climb for sure tho

I’ve now came back twice from my last $400. Turned 400 into 3k on Amazon calls over night. And just this week was back to my last $500 bought a TSLA calll and the S&p news came out and I got my first 10 bagger. It’s not over until it’s over. Still down 5k tho
Nah call is the way to go

Not a bad card! I just think it can be utilized a little better. I have different cards for different purchases. Def check out rotating cards which give you 5% each quarter on various categories such as grocery, dining etc. The reserve is nice for traveling you get $300 in credit back annually for travel purchases so the price is easily justifiable.

I bought puts on YY towards the bottom.   Hasn’t worked out.  I pushed them out to end of December and they’ve lost enough value that I’ll baghold for now.   Do you think they’ll fall further?

I was willing to let those expire worthless in 2 days from the get go, it was a lottery ticket my strategy was in the DD. But who turns down 1000% gains heading into expiry day.

Any thoughts on NIO?
You realize that that means more of my account is in GME.  1/3 in calls plus 1/3 in shares = 66% :P
AMZN
Bro you a chump.
Hold forever I think. Not only will it still be massively undervalued even if the price returns to $320 the company is only just reaching maturity. The Chinese market is increasingly middle-class which is driving massive growth for them in their core business.

Their cloud business is technologically at a similar level to GOOG GCP and AMZN AWS. No other competitors are in the same level as these 3 but crucially neither of AWS or GCP adequately serve the Asian market. If their cloud business goes profitable in March as forecasted this is going to be a massive growth center for the company going forward.

Finally the ANT IPO will eventually land, this is going to be a big boon for BABA stock as it will retain its stake but it will increase in value after public offering. I will also be buying the ANT IPO in as much volume as I can afford.

China just has more growth potential than US stocks right now but that is -not- priced in currently. TCEHY and BABA are still bargain stocks even at ATH.

If this means anything, I live where Waitr does business and a lot of people use them, they are extremely popular. Except when they pissed off local business owners (so that pissed off local users), they slowly attracted customers back. There is most definitely potential in this company. 

Also the fact that they just went positive in earnings for the first time since being public is a good sign.
Can you alert us your plays and we all get tendies together
Bro don’t tell me that I just bought a call today lmao
At least your not me and sitting on a stack of nok Jan 15 7 and 10 calls I bought in April. At least my other positions pulled me from -35% to -20% today. Guess it's what I get for not unloading them in July.

Inflation is coming for the economy eventually down the line, but it seems that stimulus leads to the stock market getting that inflation much faster than the rest of the economy.  If covid runs rampant and we get stimulus checks around the same time in January, tech could smash through.  I foresee the market staying at substantially higher levels permanently (with dips of course) just because of QE/stimulus money and the massive horde of investors that were never involved in the market before.  Vastly more money chasing the same stocks, and still with a lot of money on the sidelines
Gonna ZM my way up to the six digit club. Then I will join theta gang and conquer the world.
One last call on CRSR??? One last shot at the options bar?? One last redemption??

Also Primary Vision Networks is a small but high quality YouTube channel with guys in the investing side of the house, highly recommend them. They have more detailed info than I’ve seen anywhere else. Also do great interviews
Stocks usually go down on Black Thursday.
It will be on a constant upward trend until just before dec 21.  Once on the s&p 500, I expect it will nosedive from profit taking.  Funds will need to buy billions in shares before then, there is no way around it going up.
True, it looks like that to me too. They will be the architects of their own and our own destruction. Corporate greed/ and the shareholder driven model....well I could go on, point is stonks go down...

How much money would a 20 year old need to have to be considered “rich”?
How can you crash when you cannot sell? You know how hard is it for companies to take money out of the country?
No sale if none left in stock
But from what I've read everyone here has great emotional control already
MGNI. They do ad-services and are comparable to TTD except it’s not valued like TTD yet. It’s up ~130% in the last 30 days, and 38% this week. This is in the price discovery stage. It’s going higher. There were unusual and recent blocks of very OTM calls bought for June, institutional ownership is rocketing up with big money flowing in. I’m in June 17.5c and 2k shares @11.15.
Congrats. Sounds like a sensible approach.
Is there even any 10 bagger left this year ?

Inventory isn’t nearly as bad as it was over the Spring, half the excess total crude and products has been worked off since just July in US inventories. The distillate draws over the last 6 weeks have been killer

I ain’t sayin go long I’m sayin have a weekly quick flip, the only reason there’s been downward movement these last two days in XLE is because it’s trying to break its 200 day moving average while also busting its upper Bollinger Bands. Cali and NYC announcements spooked everyone yet it’s right back up to that 200 day. OPEC cuts will be just what it needs

I bought plenty on the dip today.
thats a nice doggo
I came too fast though

This is the way
Also I’m okay with taking the shares. I do believe this company can have some longevity
Honestly though, if we have a down turn next week, on top of buying leaps, you should sell cash secured puts on ETF's. IV is gonna be SUPER high. 

Idk man, feel like you can do it. You have more money than I could ever hope for, don't take it for granted and blow it all racing to 1 million (not to imply that I think you will). You got enough capital to basically just dump it all into SPY and almost 100% get 10% gains within 1 calendar year. Yeah I know this is r/stocks retard shit, but honestly, WSB is filled with people chasing lottos to get to where you're at now, which is why we all pick on r/stocks, because it's the chick we like but we're wearing special helmets and don't know how to socialize properly.

Dsx 1$ calls June 31 2021
Your DD is ok. But it’s lacking an incredibly important aspect.  The management team from Collier Creek (the firm that initiated the SPAC) is the management team from Pinnacle Foods. Pinnacle bought dozens of brands before Pinnacle sold to ConAgra. UTZ’s first acquisition since the IPO was HK Anderson - a ConAgra brand. That relationship is deep. I could see UTZ buying Andy Capp’s and Angie’s from ConAgra as well. 
Additionally, Campbell’s Soup owns Snyder’s-Lance.  UTZ and Snyder’s almost merged a handful of years ago. That’s the end target.  By the way, the current CEO of Campbell’s Soup is an ex-executive at Pinnacle.  Without divulging too much. I’m very much “in the know” when it comes to the snack foods landscape. 

Edit:  forgot this tidbit. UTZ is stupidly profitable. Their margins are exemplary and they’re cleaning up some distribution inefficiencies next year which will increase their margins.

Business factory
Its pretty wild that it has 130s% short interest amd 120s% owned by institutions. The shorts eventually have to cover but shit got to go up first
Rkt when they had their first earnings, Ups and fdx earnings in summer, then a bunch of EV nonsense. Also a ton of smaller options just gor earnings run ups and selling before earnings. Ive never really yolod everything on one thing, i probably could have more but i hedge and play really safe

Bitch please, show us your trades and if you really bought at 11 and sold at 19.3, I'll book a ticket right now to go suck your clit.
How much explosive growth can we see from this though? 

Seeing as it’s not your traditional growth stock I don’t see the return on this being stellar for calls.

No way.  The potential market cap is unknown.   They’ll be pulling cap from energy and oil.   They’re backed by CCP and have lead the battery compatibility.   They’re releasing their sedan in January and ramping up production quick.   Not to mention they’re looking at selling IP to other companies long term.  Check out some google videos of people that own one or review them (not the investor vids).   It’s hot and just getting started.

Just when I thought I started figuring women out they throw a curveball at you and make you rethink everything. Back to square 1
More importantly though how did you originally set the EV portfolio up? Like 20% NIO, 15% RIDE,25%FSR the rest TSLA? I'm in FSR.WS and SBE.WS. I do think its a bubble but whos to say it won't inflate for another month lol

Good job! And shoutout to you for having a healthy graph. 👍
You are not wrong.
We dont even have robinhood back then when spanish flu was around. Who the fuck do you thing is pumping our calls.
I’m a pessimist by nature and also resent the market markers who have helped squeeze the life out of the “bottom” 90% of citizens in the county.

It feels good to profit knowing those obese mega bulls are losing money. I know that’s emotional trading, so I don’t let it guide my trades, it just feel better to profit from puts.

TLDR: The market is greedy and evil, and I take more pleasure watching it fall, and riding on its back.
I hope they release it in game, like you have to play on their servers and kill a dragon or something to buy shares.

NIO grew like a cancer on this sub. And papa Elon is the surgeon
..they are the *only data analytics company that pay themselves \~$1bn compensation* if we are more accurate.

I mean, with revenue projected at $1bn for 2020 and..

"We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing." from: [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

..that's right, close to $1bn for compensation only. The company is loss-making because of how much the execs are paying themselves.

Their core revenue #s come from government contracts. Their commercial arm is weak, very weak. There is no growth if you don't crush the commercial side of things.

If people don't see a problem with a just-public company paying themselves a truckload of money putting the business in the red..well, best of luck.

disclosure: I got no positions in palantir but I see too much pumping of it.

Prolly end of day today. Ugh
She hasn't looked at you like this since...you first met? That night, three shots deep, when you bumped into each other on the way to the bathroom.

You laugh with your friends now about how that random hookup led to marriage. When you go home at night, both of you have the smug--and earned--arrogance of committed couples as you discuss how people seem sad when they hear your story. You appreciate the luck and oddity of what you have, of course. But not as much as you appreciate the hard work that got you this far.

You've never lied to this woman since you met her. The three shot beginning helped that. No filter. But you lie now. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing?" As she takes her hands off of your pants, you ask, "What's wrong?"

"I don't know." She walks from the room, briefly looking at you quizzically. She's as confused as the universe is that you would lie to her. She can't prove it of course, but she can *feel* it. Because you've never lied to her.

What's wrong is you bought calls. Too many calls. More than you could afford. More than she could afford, too, via your joint account.

Your relationship is about to meet at the bathroom for the second time, except this time it will be flushed down the drain.
Itm have less iv then otm so when my break even price strikes my calls go up a lot faster than a higher strike price, I don’t think we will see pltr in 17s again, I could be wrong but this stock has potential I wouldn’t stay in it long term though

sign up, get free stonk, sell, profit. do it again? couldn't people just do this non stop?
You’re the kind of person to dip your salad in your dressing.
Honestly might be able to catch a few EV plays next week if the momentum is there. Maybe don’t go all in but scalp a few plays if it’s going in the direction you like. Will probably still be hot early in the week. BABA will probably continue ie upward momentum. NVDA is down right now, looking to head back up next week. Earnings were good.
What do they age gin in? I usually hate gin, then I think it seems cool, get some, and remember I hate it. I think I'm in the second part of that cycle now that you said "aged"
People are basically just going to tell you to trade options on tech stocks here
why do they have more potential to be worth more..? though it was the opposite
You did one .27 contract and held. That’s making your dollar go far man.

I did 13 .03c contracts earlier this week on FUV and sold at .35. If I just had more diamond hands like you those closed at just over 10.00 before expiring...
They basically run the servers for their transactions. The boycoin community likes to make up cute names for it like mining but that’s all it is. Boycoin pays them to process the transactions. And they get paid in boycoin for doing it so there’s a real reason it follows the same chart as boycoin. A percent of their assets are always going to go up with it.
Accurate
Oh you mean stocks not options? No idea then. I would just buy ITM Tesla leaps and check back later

those things were happening regardless of obama, lol. if you think the middle-east would be stable if not for american intervention, you haven't been paying attention. the vacuums that trump is creating with his rushed abandomnent of allies are quickly occupied by russia and turkey, and the region didn't got any more peaceful. he just pushed europe into the region and made the us weaker in the world stage, as its allies arm themselves and become less reliant (and less likely to support or cede their territories to military movements) on the us , that they have come to see as unstable. the us alone ammounts to 25% of the world's gdp, with its allies to more than 50. an isolatist usa just means that china gets to dictate how the international world order will work. it already is doing exactly that with the rcep.

That shit’s gonna run up in the next week and no way they can retain the growth and provide good guidance.  Puts into early 2021 will profit, imo

Thinking about jumping on but still skeptical. Most people have no idea what the fuck they actually even do. They also lean more towards conservative politics and what does that mean with Biden in the white house and Dems possibly controlling senate?

Being a publicly traded porn company is a good way to lose most of your user base. Think about it. They would have to find more and more ways to appease stock holders at the expense of the actual consumer. I don't see any benefit to PHIB going public
What are the catalysts for this stock (other than covid announcements). Like is it reports of high projected sales demand?

I'll take his word for it but "more flexible than a traditional IPO" should be read as, "less regulated, less scrutinized, easier to profit from".
13c for 15 dollars a piece last Friday, and the price of that call tripled this week. That’s a win if you ask me.

That could be the bottom IMO. Maybe even 335. I think we close the year above 340.

It's a bit strange though because we expect slower growth in Q4 and Q1, but the outlook remains bullish for Q2 onwards.

The way we have reacted so far looks to me that the market has chosen an upwards direction in the long run after trading within a tight range for a few months. But it's too early to tell, still.

If we fail to uphold ATHs now, there is going to be very little confidence in the markets.
sounds good bub

don't worry its just a phase
In other words, after the Q4 earnings report 80% of the shares outstanding become available to be traded, or am I misunderstanding. Would that be in their public filings?
That’s my thing 😂😂😂 that one person three wheeler car is kinda weird but the company does have a rather nice package in which they restore old classics and convert them to EVs. 

Furthermore I believe they have plans on opening a few showrooms in the near future.
Don’t think it works that way but you should be buying what’s on sale whenever possible

Same here, boomers could get fairly easy jobs and make 100k 20 years ago while houses were 300k.

2) literacy is not so low, most people will have a family member/friend that can read. Also literacy is improving as gdp increases in most countries.
3)a high valuation will allow JMIA to secure capital and  work out kinks in their operation. Ultimately their experience as a European e commerce company operating in Africa is an invaluable asset even if they’ll get acquired by another western company, they are likely here to stay.
4) I find your cynicism distasteful. So you read a financial report and decided this is an unsolvable problem, a whole lot of competent professionals decided it’s worth years of their life and capital, I rather tie my future to optimists who are trying to make money by growing an enterprise, fixing something than some 🌈🐻trying to make a buck by saying it can’t be done.

Oh yeah we should be all good. Had some serious issues with business being shut down so cash dried up and i was basically living on my passive income that isnt relly enough for anything yet. 

So a new plays here and a few there. Money is whatever. If i lost it and went in debt then id just use the last 2.5k to pay for the operation and deal with the debt later.
Not up 500% on the year? Not my kind of stock.

I agree, it’s ridiculous. I could go on for hours. I really need to vent with someone. Do you have zoom?
Anyone desensitized to huge losses
The only use case I see for these cars (ignoring that they're fugly) is for huge cities with very limited parking. Other than that they're shit, a Mini Cooper could total one of those at 40 MPH
What?
Another Vodka soda good sir
I currently have an 86% return on it. It’s a Canadian EV company which mainly deals with buses. My average was CAD $15.36. Wealthsimple fucked my ass when they removed the buy option 🤦🏻‍♂️ it just started rising from there
My position are 50k in NIO long term
yessss my SPY puts are green
it sucks. I’m glad I’m learning now rather than down the road when I have more per se.
Most investors thing options are so risky they will never touch them.  That’s quite a sad life
I bought 545c for next week at close 😎
Sure, if you would like to buy nothing. I’ll take some pocket sand.
Gyms closed. PTON gap fill to 120. I’m 30k deep, but want to buy weeklies as well.
Proof or ban
Jan 2020 I can confidently tell you it will be over 200. Look at their numbers and growth rate compared to Tesla not even counting the other beneficial factors and it’s easy math. 200 for 2022 is stingy it will likely be over babas current numbers with the revolutionary tech they have and support
Would that have worked on you? 🤪🍑🍆
that works too. But 18th is the date of inclusion so I'd puta my bets on that. The original hype is dying...
It’s cool if you do that in the daily thread... But posting a new topic for that is obnoxious

Thanks, I will keep that in mind for next time.
You sell cash secured weekly puts on stocks you wouldn't mind holding, and collect premium from the gamblers in here.
True. That’s also true with literally any option in general. I do believe it has more upside with EV being in a bubble right now.
I don't blame you, that's the smart move. If we moon on Monday, I'll probably take my profits. Good luck!

Things are going to look quite different in 40 to 45 years even if inflation stays pretty tame which actually my numbers kind of assume.  If we go to 1970s inflation again going to need more like 20 million.

I lost $21k and my whole account this week
For most growth companies capex and/or capitalized development is higher than D&A on the income statement. Levered free cash flow also reflects changes in net working capital which also not on I/S. Many I/S line items are accounted for on an accrual basis, but cash into and out of the system may not match - one example is companies pay interest on their bonds 2x per year, but the interest expense on the I/S is smoothed out over quarters. There’s 1,000s of other differences though - these are just some.

No, cause usually when people discover options their account goes the OPPOSITE way
Yeah, I think everything you’re saying makes a ton of sense. I do agree that rising COVID cases won’t be the catalyst for another leg down because people are somewhat expecting it, would probably have to be some other black swan event. After I saw what that single vaccine pump was able to do, can’t imagine what’s gonna happen next. But we will see. It’ll work out for one of us man. BOL!

Why a SPAC then?
Honestly as a 30 year investor if you’re not taking advantage of NIO and xpeng to a slightly smaller degree you’re a retard. Every single analyst I Respect can see the same thing i do. Mark this comment and come talk to me in a year so I can rub it in. This is literally the chance of the year and this is coming from someone who got in on Amazon at the 200’s. Bear enjoy eating from the dumpster as always
Retards on here won’t tell you this because they play with 100% of their money and it’s only $60 in their Robinhood account but Vanguard Total Market 75%, Vanguard Total International 20%, 5% whatever the fuck you want. This is after you build a 6-12 month emergency fund. Book wise Millionaire Next Door.

12/18 $10c ... If you're right I'm screwed lol

I just went lots of shares because I already have other big calls and didn't want to incur more risk. If I did one, it would probably be January and 560ish because I try to be extra-secure if the company's calls cost a lot.

Too scared to fall in love with my current girlfriend cause my ex broke my heart

Lol 😂 when it’s official I got you . Just want to see if Trump has his cards laid out . Haven’t forgotten!
I bet those were up 300% earlier today though, every day you wait more bag holders give up hope
If WSB was an options chain I’d skip buying that strike because of low volume.

Whose data should I believe?
I hear there’s a terrorist organization brewing inside the American homeland as we speak. It’s called “y’all-Qaeda”
I picked up 8x 520c 11/27  today. Slightly green. I seen this coming but didn’t think it would break out until Monday. Hope to grab a few tendies next week. I’ll jump back in after earnings to play an oversold bounce or top fish if it moons to stupid levels again. Is SoftBank in on this?
Every time I see his picture I think it’s intentionally distorted to make him look like a smushface but it’s actually true that his face looks like that.

December IPO right?
PLTR is the way of the future. 


No matter how much bad rap it gets from people, it is an essential company. Not only for anti-terrorism/military, but also for things like public health/contact tracing/vaccine logistics. 


It is a nightmare from ESG perspective but i dont really care. It’s a good contrarian play. 


The power of the PLTR tools are too tantilizing for government to ignore. For better or for worse, all governments will want to be able to track everyone. They will have to do so in order to stay competitive in the future world. Just accept it and make money.
Fair enough
Sell the 12/18 14 put. Fat premium and if you get assigned your cost is 13.xx
I’d be shocked if some boomer analyst doesn’t raise PLTR price target in the next month

12/24 is more than enough for it to print so absolutely hold it
There's plenty I could have done to yield the same result. Your mom would have paid me the same amount to go to dinner with her every Saturday, but I chose this route instead.

It’s not, and neither is BLNK. But we live in a world of first movers with the advent of the retail trader. It goes against everything I was taught about technicals. If it’s a company with a real product and revenue then it’s worth a shot. Otherwise, you have seen NKLA (people still buy that shit!).

You’re a god damn fearmongering bear and if you’re not you’re an idiot who doesn’t know how to do research. Tell me after you do real research that the big Chinese EVs are going anywhere but up. There’s nothing we can do about it whether we like it or not. Do your homework before you post stupid bullshit. NIO is going to touch base with 200 before next years end and if you didn’t make money of it you don’t belong in this game you fucking cuck.

Tech valuations are pricing in exponential growth in the future in perpetuity. I’m not saying it will decline, but if you’re trading at 50x revenue, there needs to be growth to justify that multiple. If there is no growth, then 50x P/S is absolutely absurd. 

Imo Square is overhyped because of cash app. FISV has more growth and out does SQ in every main business line. FISV gets no attention because it’s not a meme, even though it’s a way better company fundamentally.  I know you can point to digital currencies as what makes SQ better, but underneath the hood of digital currencies is one of the largest Ponzi Schemes in history run by Bitfinex/Tether. Square is unknowingly (I hope) helping funnel government backed currency into funny money that could all be gone when authorities find a way to prosecute Bitfinex/Tether for fraud. Right now the “outside your jurisdiction” defense works, but it won’t work forever. 

5G is just a marginal improvement over 4G networks. It’s an expected improvement, nothing revolutionary at all. At this point, the “5G revolution” is just marketing.  Qualcomm won’t go away of course, it’s just expected. Similar hype was around Qualcomm during the dotcom bubble, but investors eventually realized telecom networks are fairly low margin and can’t justify high multiples. 

We’re really coming full circle with the tech bubble. Tech won’t go away, but the big tech companies in the future may not be the same ones we have today.
Wait until you realize you are probably going to need between 2 and 3 million to retire comfortably with inflation.

I think the party's over if interest rates get bumped and I think everybody has that in the back of their head.. but it has to happen. I'm also a bit concerned about the end of the year.

I don't understand the ins and outs of tax law, but I've read some speculation that there could be a lot of shifting around of money EOY in order to take advantage of tax law while Trump is still in office. The fear I think is that Biden will make changes to capital gains tax

Naked brand to the 🌚

TSLA 500c 12/18
BA has massive government contracts, they make pricey planes, space gear, etc. So what?
Hmm 🤔🧐🤔 should I sell you these??
Rules for betting, don’t be dead. But seriously don’t do something that is gonna ruin your life. If your life is already ruined, don’t let me stop you though...

Also if you’re already retarded this place wasn’t gonna save you. You need to save yourself
Why isn't fisker doing better?
just gotta say shout out XPENG! it did beautifully the past two days. Turned $25 into $300 in basically 5 minutes...

Bitch we complain because our weeklies are about to expire worthless.
People don't give a fuck if ES goes down because there's always a dip to buy in this blown-out market.

Vol decreases when people could care less about the consequences of going long at the top.
Didnt pltr have a direct listing and not an ipo?
It's kind of sad how many people base their views of a particular politician based on how they talk and not act.

Obama destabilized the middle east and northern africa with the arab spring and killing gadafi, created a migration crisis which bled into europe, but he's a coooool guy so we like him.

Meanwhile Trump is a social media troll who fumbles his words and didn't start any new wars, but you'd think he really was orange hitler.

Maybe this isn't the best place to ask but can anyone explain to me how Levered Free Cash Flow is different than Net Income to Shareholders? The calculation seems to be the exact same but the numbers are different on all the cash flow statements I'm seeing
At this point I’m convinced WSB could be an EV company and have the stock hit $100 by next fall after a spring IPO of $4.20.

Yeah, I was bullish on that late day / AH action, I know it didn’t preform well, but those huge sell walls were obviously places to hinder any real buying, I suspect if Monday futes are green we gap back To 19.
PTON $120 is actually so likely.
Right cuz financial institutions and banks never use algos to facilitate millions of trades a day? And they literally made their money off of bid/ask spreads. They absolutely hold long term positions if there are no buyers. Also most of these banks run private wealth management and hold MASSIVE long term positions for all of their clients, taking in fees. They have to dump their positions both when the market is dropping so they don't baghold worthless stocks they can't make pennies off of anymore, and so their clients don't destroy them. Also so they have liquidity so they aren't over leveraged, which they all are even after '08.
This guy market caps
It's in accumulation mode. Shaking off weak hands

Could you explain this in basketball terms?
You guys ready to yolo on the Airbnb ipo and make that bank? Or y’all a bunch of bitch bears ?
Have you realized the IPO time interval vs the volume congruency? In other words stop being a pussy and yolo.
You could have bought VOO with same result
If you're in a western country and know people in China, your sample is skewed. The people who don't have connections to the West has starkly different psychology. 

Yeah I know people in third world countries that don't buy third world shit because they wanna feel better about themselves by buying American gadgets. But their behavior is definitely few and far between.

So, Robux is the future currency of the new world order??!!!!!
Well done
There are better plays for more upside. If you dont mind mid/long term plays, do 1/3 into ayro, 1/3 into aezs calls far out for a fun but very realistic gamble, and 1/3 into brqs shares for a fundamental play

Bruh you have puts on a freight train. Get fuuuuucked
IMO Fisker is the most undervalued EV. Fisker designed Aston Martins and team is legit 

Nio and XPEV are def overvalued but are at least legit companies with great products, founders and backers.

they aren't convinced. they are secretly trying to sell at 22 while telling others its a 300 stock.
Anyone else playing NRZ? I made a killing today on it.
I’m the guy who takes a shit on the barstool at the bar!
There is only the WSB way you take all your money then you check what stonks have the most meams in here and you wait till that bitch hit its peak least 300% and that’s when you buy and just sit back and watch the magic to happen 🎢🤑🤑🤑
Upgraded from Huggies? Congrats tho
If can look really good with the strip and that outlet is placed well. But I love a good install, it's satisfying! And the only time I've ever clowned somebody's tv is for being too big; my friend has a 65 or 70 in their bedroom and it's obnoxious, I feel like the light from the screen will scorch their eyeballs.
I originally bought shares at 9.83. Then I saw ARK bought 1 million shares at 16. So I got more lol.
Nah dude it used to be wayyyyy livelier in there, most posts would get at least a few hundred comments. Now most posts don’t even hit double digits
No. Maybe he threw in some PIPE $?
Or the guy that moans when they take a shit. Wtf is wrong with those people?
Cant remember exactly. But 80% of total stocks are still locked until Q4 report.

FuelCell Energy  
Latest Developments

FCEL received $8 million funding from the US Department of Energy to design and manufacture a SureSource electrolysis platform for producing hydrogen in October. It also agreed to distribute green hydrogen to Toyota to accelerate its fuel cell car and truck adoption, as a part of the National Hydrogen and Fuel day celebration. FCEL is currently working on generating solid oxide hydrogen for commercial sale, storage, and power generation.

FCEL raised $177.35 million through a public offering of 50.03 million shares. The company plans to utilize the proceeds for technological advancements and business growth, as well as develop its presence in South Korea and Asian markets.

Idk man I'm super new and there shouldn't be anything wrong from learning from you old fucks. I've asked so many retarded ass questions on this sub bc I'm insecure in my decisions but I'm extremely grateful for your advice/reassurance. Hopefully I can pay it back soon.
Better gamma go uppies next week.
Amazon/Tesla/Baba/Zoom/Palantir/Solo calls going into Monday and not the least bit worried. Let’s fucking gooo
Could be a dump or not?

Making money is making money.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Didn’t even close under yesterday’s low. We could see a nice move coming next week
Monday morning, NIO is at 45. I sell a weekly call at 47 strike for $200. 

At the end of the week, if NIO is down, I've got the $200 to offset my losses.

If NIO is flat, I've got the $200 as gain.

If NIO jumps to $47, I have $200 from the stock and $200 from the premium.

If NIO jumps higher than $49, I would have made more money not selling the call. But I still have a $400 profit on the week, for a $4,500 block of stock.

The premium I collect is insurance against every week the stock is down or flat.

It's easy money.  I strongly recommend.
You could land a jumbo jet in the space between racist boomer cuck investors and the degenerate gamblers on here.  Not a binary choice.
What makes you think xpev has a good shot for further highs by January?
Ready Player 1 vibes
No clue tbh but I’m assuming next quarter
Literally can't if trump will fucking tweet every time it hits ath.
who gives a shit...bunch of people will sell lockup shares...don't think that will really bring the price down
Glad I can help man.
Their main strategy is buy an index fund and hold for 50 years. Since timing the market is impossible, put money in regularly and go on with your life. There really shouldn't be much discussion on that sub anyway.

Of how many shares?

It would make more sense for him to issue the share dilution after the S&P 500 inclusion.

Market makers are not the same as algo bots. Market makers literally just create liquidity by facilitating trades. They hold no long term positions in the market. They’re constantly hedging to stay delta and gamma neutral.
If the float doubles in size because they have 1 billion shares about to potentially get dumped on the market that would be bad for the performance of the stock.
Cuz ev sector is in a bubble
ok
Right now it's just riding the current EV hype. But t3 company is betting on a return in demands as the pandemic ends next year and road trip in EV cars resume.

I thought the same.  Then researched it.  Don’t do it.
This is actually sad if you estimate how much time of your Friday night was wasted on creating this.
dude, I saw the same thing, then threw $200 on gnus calls for the shits and giggles in the spirit of wsb. btw AEZS has cheap af calls, I am loaded on 500 1c Jan contracts. If it pops, itll be a nice $100k profit for christmas for the $2500 i paid for them

It's a quote from the show that you are quoting you retard.
It's the difference between everybody being at a party together and having a good time (bulls) compared to you and I dueling to the death and I win lots of money as you bleed out (bears).

Both have their appeal.
I honestly agree with you, and it's hard for me to buy puts for a "second leg down" (as in, a March repeat) despite a lot of the TA suggesting it should happen, *because* that seems like the most logical thing to happen with the world seemingly falling to shit around us. It's like my brain has been re-wired to only buy tech calls. 

It really looks like SPY is forming a triple top, and God knows I'd love to get rich as a bear on the elevator down, but the sentiment just doesn't feel the same as it did in February, you know? People are tired of COVID, but they're not panicking. 

Maybe it really is as simple as just buying calls, man. Fuck if I know. I'm just a retard gambling here. Some SPY $330p 12/11s might be a nice hedge.
Sitting on 750 shares and waiting for a transfer to pick up some more

Especially fun when you consider that the places with the worst spread in NYC were correlated with Trump support including Orthodox Jewish areas and Staten Island. Because wearing a mask is some sort of conspiracy against freedom.
Down 21% past month. Down 26% past 3 months. Up 7% in the past 6. 

Sept. And Oct are always my worst months. Still up 45% all time though so I'm not terribly upset.
I thought your messy bedroom looked real sexy tbh, keep it up

Why not keep my options now then sell options to buy options later

I like to keep my account as leveraged as possible so I can x200 or x0
I’m pretty confident we will run to 15-16 by earnings, then Q3 will be ok, good guidance, and I’m betting RC makes some right moves after earnings, he wouldn’t wait till end of Q4 to make moves. Also there’s still christmas sales, and they could release console and Christmas sales PR sometime in late December or early January. It’s a risky move to buy Jan 30’s, but if earnings aren’t great, Cohen will use this as more of a reason to buy GME and put more pressure on mgmt. if earnings are good and they state they will work with Cohen, boom short squeeze begins, however it will be slower than if Cohen buys GME

Good post. I’ve always been extremely skeptical of the naive idea that somehow advances in computing power would lead to the replication of the human mind, up to and including the replicating experiential consciousness. We have no idea why or how the lights are on. 

Americans are raised and educated in an environment of naive background materialism. All of our institutions take it for granted the world is just particles bumping into each other obeying deterministic physical laws. 

It creates strange and unwarranted assumptions and discussions of AI lay those bare. The brain is just a computer! We can make computers, so we can make a brain! The line of reasoning infantile but literal geniuses agree with it because the assumptions are so fundamental to their understanding of reality.

It’s wild.

Palantir has a set of products which can crunch huge quantities of data and give quick results. We use their product called ‘Foundry’ but they have other more successful product ‘Gotham’ which has a few government clients. They are not strong among enterprises but strong in US government contracts. For AI you need to look at ‘Gotham’. But not sure how much more they can milk existing long running government contracts. ‘Foundry’ has competition in Tableau, Cliq and a whole bunch of new companies. 

Also they will not give you solution, you have to decide how to use them. If a person doesn’t know how they will use these products the implementation will fail and after sometime they will stop using it. My company is trying hard to make it a success as it is one of the early investors and wants to give as much opportunities as possible. But not sure how much other companies will wait. I felt other companies have better operating model where they try to look at a company business and try to propose how their products can add value

Hell yeah! That’s awesome! Great week for me as well, was able to hit a little over 3k profit which was nice! Wish I had been able to hold onto my tsla calls a bit longer, but hey, profit is profit!
It’s the most absurd one besides NKLA. I bought the run from 2.5 and sold at 5. Bought a daily bear call spread today that worked because it’s the only safe thing.

He used a drone strike to kill a war criminal and Iran knew they couldn't turn to anyone on that. The difference between Bush/Obama, and it is a difference a light year wide, is no other country gives a shit about Iran. Not Russia, not China, not anyone else. He did not get into a conflagration, he was the least volatile president in half a century, but yes he was the bad man with the bad tweets so I guess he brought us to the brink of nuclear war.

Yea, the valuation is bubbly 🤷‍♂️  but all those industries are extremely large in terms of revenue. Tesla probably won’t capture the whole market but it reasonably can grow a few trillion more over the next decade, it just takes a bit of imagination. On the fundamentals Tesla is worth maybe $25-50 a share, obviously people are imagining what it can be and not what it is.

Moderna scares me. Similar to xpeng to Nio. You either gain big or lose big. Regardless of whether moderna or Pfizer makes the vaccine, you'll both go up. I'd just would hate it if it rises like 30% after a vaccine is made and shipping and then sink 50% because everyone is selling off and placing their funds towards other stocks like airlines.

Big boys are trading shares to each other and want it kept a secret (too much volume for open market to handle). Once these positions are in place and insiders stop selling, stock will only moon.

You could do half, which would be half as dumb or half as smart.
Yes. Was down about 9k in September and October and now up 1k. I am in UK so trade CFDs. Important to realize what works for you and what doesn't - and to stick to that. I realized I can't trade price movement in 5m and 10m. So I gave myself a time horizon of a week to a month. Also I started having a more balance portfolio of growth and value. I lurk WSB to pick up the meme stocks. Meme stocks tend to do well (most times) regardless of what the market is doing. However, don't get to greedy with meme stocks. Make small profits and get out. Also no point in entering them too late. For instance, Nio

What do you guys think. All expiring on Dec 18 and Jan for BABA
The only way to feel something from gains is to lose way more than you can stomach to lose. 

Then every win matters both in notional value and in gambling logic.
I want to be in it, but I’m afraid we might have missed it? Unless we make it the next meme stock 🤔

I'm starting to buy more positions a few months out. When I'm SURE it's going up or down I'll still grab weeklies though. So far so good...
Not correct, it’s been through this same process before only to get struck down.

I’m never getting the time back I spent reading all that.
Wtf is this bullshit, President Trump used a drone to kill an Iranian general. They retaliated with medium range ballistic missiles. President Trump could easily have caused a larger conflict. I don’t disagree with his actions, but to pretend that he has not been using the mil as a big dick is disingenuous. His moves in Syria point to a man trying to unmire the US out of conflict, but they also look like he’s trying to appease foreign powers. I don’t know the right of it, but I think that he would have no problem getting involved with war.
I know it isn't likely & not a pharmacist but I really think this could be the next Vioxx if enough is overlooked & fast tracked.

If even a fraction as deadly would kill a bunch of people.

Never. And that’s a good thing. Stay hungry and try not to let the stupid win.
bi-sexualnance allows you to, but the amount you can borrow is dependent on your balance/trade history.

Otherwise look up coin I will not name CFD's and futures. Lots of leverage there with margin + contracts. 

I also believe 'bye bit' (no e, one word) does up to 100x.
MAC, short interest is insane and they have 10 AAA+ properties that have 95% occupancy. This one is a long play for when we recover from the pandemic 1 year plus, but its already started to pop. Got in at shares for 7$.

I know for a fact it was mostly luck and on top of it I made a ton of stupid bets that's ate into my profits like a motherfucker, I could probably be closer to 20k if I didn't just love throwing money away. When will I feel satisfied? 50k? 100k? 1m? Probably never

I don't disagree with you.  But the concept here (WSB) is yolo leverage.  100k of options is not the same as 100k of stocks.  That's the point here.
You can deduct 3k from your taxable income and therefore reducing your tax bracket which is approximately 1k back.
I see. So 300 soon?
If you do then you just might join u/Deepfuckingvalue  in folklore.

Who says pfizer is even ready?  Maybe they still gotta crunch the clinical trial stats.  It's not gonna be as easy as the vaccine prevents covid.  What about the other 5% that got covid after the vax?  Maybe the vax reduced severity and hospital time?  Did they have something in common?  Was it in a specific racial group?  Who knows?  There are a lot of layers that need to be analyzed before presenting. It could be PFE that needed the time.

As a leftist that's a dream come true.

So what's the reason PLTR will hit 21 next week? Meme strength?
Already sold out, if you want one for New Years you’d have to had ordered it a month ago
The problem is retards buying calls with 1 week expiry 30% OTM. I don't understand why every person in this sub thinks buying OTM calls with short expiry is a good idea, but I'm glad they do because my CCs are a nice bonus. Either buy options ATM or ITM or just stop playing options if you don't know what you're doing.
We went from short squeeze to growth stock?!

Sumo is a cool name I’d buy that one!
I just got into options a couple weeks ago, honestly. So mostly shares up to now, by far.

Haven't made any big options plays; going small and cashing out at 30-50% returns to try to learn a little bit first. I've got small options positions in APHA, AYRO, DKING and FSR that all expire in January and February and will see how those go.

Something going on in the dark pools and PLTR.
CNBC " FDA says its panel of outside advisors will meet on December 10 to discuss Pfizer's emergency use application for its Covid-19 vaccine ". 

That's just great almost 500k cases in the last 7 days, and the FDA decided to wait until December 10 to discuss the vaccine. Why is the meeting not tomorrow?
Awesome man, keep it up. I've turned 12,500 to 13,800 in the last 2 weeks strictly stocks with stop losses. Options just kept raping me, so I needed a break
Unless it’s TSLA then kiss your tendies good buy like me 🤡
Market cap too high, and its up 50% over a few days. I missed the boat. I only do trades that have 5x plus potential. Not to say it doesnt, but I dont feel it

PTON was angling down hard first five minutes. I noticed it and caught it at -1% and went oh no you don't even though I liked peloton long-term. Sold my April call and shares. Once i sold it it immediately took a 180 and went up to +5% without ever looking back.

I think its possible. When I spammed AYRO it was at 1mil volume, now its at 125mil. As long as the algo bots and scalpers keep swing trading it, people will fomo in and drive up the price. Its the cheapest EV stock left with the lowest market cap. I imagine $20 by jan

You are so dumb and poor and it shows... they are back ordered for like 6 months. They can’t keep up with demand. Just because you can’t afford it doesn’t mean other ppl can’t,been waiting on mine for 2 months now

Bought $80k worth of shares at $15, so I sure hope you're right.
Sounds like me every Sunday betting on football lol
Happy holidays fam, enjoy the tendies. I am holding my options for another few months or until $20ish, sold out my 10k shares and reallocated.
oh yeah i was meaning to tell you. we filled the janitor position. will contact you if any other opportunities arise.
Good choice! $638 is quite good for an A7! Which year?

Based on this comment, you should not be playing options. Seriously, just stick with meme stock shares and you can hit 10% a week with much less risk. Which is just a casual 500% per year.

wtf is OPEX?
RKT
I’m down total but not because of my affiliation with WSB. I lost 750K with Bernie Madoff in ‘08 and go figure, I haven’t made any mentionable portion of that back buying FD’s. 

The only sage advice I have is... trade small until you know what the fuck you’re doing. If you don’t really understand how option premium is derived, just buy shares. 

I’m not theta gang but I don’t usually trade FD’s either. I like to buy 60+ days expiry. That or shares. If I buy anything expiring within 5 days it’s usually a hedge.

Got 100 shares at $18.55. Hoping my 12/24 21.5 calls print. What’s the move on leaps for Monday?
Someone mentioned it on here a few days ago and I had $28 left in my gambling account, so I found the cheapest call. Mar 21/$7.50. Cost me $25. It was 1200% up today. God bless that guy's heart. So yesterday I bought some more calls with real money and they too are up 300%. 

Cannot got tits up, everyone buy, free trendies. 😃
Its pretty unique, not sure what to compare it to really. It's pretty strong, around 14%, so think kinda like a wine. Theres a big spread of quality between the cheap stuff and the really great expensive stuff. You wanna chill it down in the fridge a bit and just drink it like a wine. The flavors are kinda subtle, but a lot of times I find myself reminded of a honeydew melon. You can find a small selection at most of the larger liquor stores, dunno what you have in your area, but look for something around 20 bucks a bottle and that should give you an idea of what its about

I've only gone up. Rotating in and out of popular stocks has helped. I could make more but the fact I started out with 3k earlier this year and finally broke the 10k barrier with a lot of losses learning how not to do options I couldn't be happier. I still have JCP if anyone wants those.
I've been down 40k in a day (and it was 90% of my account) and I've lost plenty more, some large some small. I've learned a lot. I'm back up over 50k. After a while it loses it's terror. The losses are just part of the process. Nobody goes green all the time.
Just lick your wounds and stay over. Learn from your mistakes! We're you using too much of your account on each position? Were you holding on to losers because you didn't want to lose 5%? We're you buying too far OTM?
Figure it out! Don't do that again!
Good luck. I know the pain of cratering your hard earned money. Just remember it's only money, but don't gamble the fucking rent you dipshit.
You are taking the best month of nio and the best quarter and assuming it will grow at the same rate. They dont even make their own cars and the growth they had prior was in the triple digits. They have stagnated to 18-22% quarterly growth in sales. Nio is slowing down when it should show nothing but more growth. That is only because we are the in the busiest time to sell cars. Next quarter they will probably do less like every other car company does in Q1. People buy cars in particular towards the end of the year.

I feel as though that could bounce back due to that but sustain long term growth

Since we’re all too poor to actually own 100 shares of Tesla we hold these options in the hope they go up and we sell them to people that do. You get 100x leverage which means for every cent in the money the stock moves your option moves $1. You can also sell options which means you get the premium and hope the stock moves opposite of what you actually sold so it expires worthless but you get the full premium.

Thank you for sharing your story, i truly feel for you. im doing well in the market so far but always good to see something like this to remember the risks. i can’t imagine those kind of gains and losses. Good news is your life isn’t over, you can make more money, and you can even invest again one day (though I suspect you will do more of a buy and hold etf strategy rather than options). You’ll bounce back from this.  Good luck to you!

Take the persons 3 initials, and find their ticker. If it doesn't exist, try it with just the first and last initials.

You're longing their spirit. Its what they would have wanted.

Hits me in the nose too much but still delish
Pretty stoked to see SBE hold 26. If she pops more I'll keep adjusting my stop limit because I think when she falls its gonna hit hard. Maybe around merger time.
We might dip after earnings, but it will only make the RC tender offer situation more likely. And yea, shareholders vote would take some time, but I don’t think him placing the offer would take too long, I’m sure he already has a plan
I haven’t seen any posts today declaring the top. So I guess it’s my turn.

Sell! Sell everything at open Monday, today was the top

One of us will be right eventually.

I would gargle a random scrotum for Alibaba to hit $300 next week
probably not a bad move. the subs for those un-nameable things are 99% bullish hopium, which means its ripe for a crash. ngl i help feed into it bc i bought relatively low and want the high to keep getting higher.
Missionary
Let me ask your mom
I never realized how much i needed this
I’ve been here a decent amount of time, like 5 years, and I cant think of that many weekends in the history of this sub that were more anticipated than this one. It might just be because I’m actually all in meme stocks this weekend for the first time in a year or two... maybe it has nothing to do with this sub at large... am I black out drunk again? Probably. Fucking PLTR... if we don’t at least hit $21 next week I’m gonna be pissed at some of y’all. It’s cool I’ll get over it.
If fucking SOLO can moon, then so can Canoo.  Goddamit.
Unlikely. But not impossible. It did go up like 20% in August.
Dunno about NIO but they aren't wrong about SOLO

PLTR, a ticker that has yet to make a dollar but moons.  RKT, literally profits BILLIONS of net income every quarter, shit ticker.

RKT has made more money this year than TSLA in over a decade.

Cap loss write offs for next two decades as the year end draws closer. Can’t tell if I suck cause the standard deduction is still better.
I jumped in with quite a large share position today. Let’s see where this goes. I just have some worries with price drop after earnings report. Hopefully RC pulls through with the tender offer, however that’ll definitely take some time I think?

That fact has been hammered into my head don’t worry, but I don’t understand the shift to small cap stock from large cap during a time when it’s becoming more likely stim will be small if anything at all, Fed is stopping lending programs, and the worst of Covid is obviously ahead with likely harm to a lot of small-medium businesses..

ARRY has been around for years and yes, it just went public.. but it hasn't been profitable up until 2019.  Which is good, dont get me wrong, but just now coming to market, it looks like they are just riding the "green market agenda" of Biden and will gladly take investors money, I just can't see them long term comparing to wind.  Probably a good 1 year investment in my honestly opinion.
You're going to buy something that ran up nearly 300% in less than a month and is being shit on by citron like they did to nio? Good luck.

Don't you just hate when you're taking a shit and the water splashes on your ass cheek
anyone wanna lend me like 100k so i can throw 50 on two diff EV companies shares? I’ll give you 150k back when it’s worth 200k (obviously joking) but ugh i wish
I would say around the anal creampie chances
I should have. It’s cool tho, gained from Nio couples weeks back and now lost it all back to Nio. I’m new to all this options and investing shit btw. Learning the hard way 🤷‍♂️

I just lurk and I dont think there's anything wrong with not posting anything. The post is for people that post shitty gain/loss porn and garbage DD. It dilutes the quality of posts on the sub.

Thx
Pretty well. Won on the TSLA fomo calls, BYND shares bought after earnings last week, and RTX calls bought after the vaccine pump. Decent loss on ZM calls bought last friday sold midweek. Overall net gain around 2k holding some RUN calls over the weekend. You?
What do you mean?

Thanks for giving me hope
Was down over 150k earlier this year.  Lots of stupid moves.  Now got that back and about 350k in gains - I changed my strategy to basically not do anything too retard - and when I get bored I trade swings.  I still do plenty of retarded stuff, and typically get fucked on every earnings play I make.

Hey my bad then, like I said, I think I’m just salty/on edge from some of the shit others have said and need to let it roll off my back. I’m assuming it’s either dudes that have had a nasty breakup or lost money and want to take it out on an easy target (ie. an easy username to bs about). 

Yeah I had no idea what it was either but another dude the other day was asking what you get with gold and I had responded, so a different person kept giving me awards as I explained each one to the other. That makes zero sense. It was a funny shit posting experience that I’m grateful for because I don’t have ads now for awhile 😂

Hope you’re having a good week, and yeah, sorry I unloaded a bit there. This week has just been a bit stressful with the entire covid crap, and other junk piled on top of life. Need to be able to take a joke again. 🤦🏼‍♀️

Have a similar story. I bought $2662 traded at the hong kong stock market, about 2k$ worth of it, at 1.12$/share. Was up like 10% and a week later it got halted. Couldn‘t sell since then, holding since approximately 2 years.. feels bad man
What is the move then
Yeah. That’s what I’m asking. I don’t know. How many do they make per year? And how many of that goes to China?
Thanks! You're very kind to say that.

I got Jan 150 AAPL that I bought in Sept high. I think we are both fucked, and just bagholding. AAPL has no catalyst until ER Jan 28th. I want to believe we start seeing rotation back into tech, but I doubt it.
It’s the first stock I ever bought. The next day they were being investigated by the SEC. I kept all 100 Shares...
Boooooo paper trades.
NVDA killed my 11/27 545 calls
I’m less skeptical than of most other evs. Its niche, it will be cheap(er) and it will own the streets of densley populated cities
1. I gave my options more time. 
2. I didn’t fight the momentum and rode the waves. 
3. I stopped adding to loosing positions.
4. Luck.
5. And if you lurk around WSB, there are a lot of decent plays/DDs that might look autistic but are hidden gems.
You’ll regret selling the Tesla for the rest of your life. Just broke out of the bull flag fool.

Here in St. Louis, covid is spiking higher and higher.  Trump finally coming yo terms the election is over, and his announcement of making medications cheaper and sticking it to the pharma companies so they can't continue raping the US residents with inflated prices where they sell for half or more for the same medicine in other countries...is going to add to volatility.  Biden taking over, and seeing seeing the big companies supporting his campaign, their stocks will increase after he is sworn in.  Lobbyist and Special Interest groups come back in to control the economy.

If the share price was 300 it would actually be worth 470 Billion(300 billion MORE than Lockheed Martin) and if shares were 1500 it would be worth 2.35 trillion(more than Apple). Getting to 1500 would be an 8,150% gain on a company that’s already worth 28.49 Billion.

Because China has developed their own domestic steel industry while the US killed theirs with imports.

Steel will come back quite a bit over the next couple years though. The political mechanisms are currently in place to keep Union power limited, so domestic industries are safe to start coming back now. 

Domestic steel pricing is back to where it was in January 2019, when X was trading at  $21-22 per share. Considering it's at $10.96 per share today, the stock is way undervalued still One catalyst and it's going to fly.

Uh oh
It hasn't been at 30 since it zoomed past it on its first trading day a little over a month ago. It opened at 22 so when you bought in it was at ATH and also up 36% on the day.
Omg you are so funny!!! That made me spit out my beer!
You mean kidney bean
Haha thanks. Sometimes I'm a genius and sometimes I'm a total retard, like most of us I guess.

Most of my plays were already in motion. Had calls on ETSY and SUMO waiting, as well as some solar sector calls. I made a few plays at open and bought puts on MGM, Uber, and Lyft. Really fucking risky play, but I felt like the market underestimated how bad this Winter is for Covid and how quickly we will put it behind us, so I felt that casinos and travel were overbought.

Later in the day, I made a very very small play and just bought 2 calls on Twitter and SNAP.

Last thing I have in the works is that I've been holding calls on CLNE and WPRT. These are Liquified Natural Gas companies. This is a supposedly cleaner form of fuel, mainly used for trucks right now and can be produced from waste. Both of these stocks have moved up a decent bit in the last 2 weeks, but have kinda flown under the radar. The play isn't a slam dunk though, because I need Biden to get behind them or for some news to break to push them into meme status. Still CLNE was up about 8.5% today and WPRT was up like 15%.

But yeah WPRT has almost doubled in the last month and CLNE is up about 40% since. This could be the next FCEL/PLUG if it catches fire, but it could fade out too.. Do some research on your own if you want. I like these plays a lot, but there's no certainties when trying to predict the next meme stocks lmao

Also, what the fuck is *wine the pooh*?
Yes... they never meet the deadline. It's because Elon over promises in terms of dates. His time line is 5x times faster in his mind and even if Tesla misses it's still 3x faster than everybody else.   


Where to start?  
\- Rtrded boomer car companies couldn't come up with decent EVs until Tesla. Even now all the sht they came up with are still marketing sham. Half decent are the chinese ones that stole from Tesla anyway...   
\- Tesla's autonomous project is based on NN not lidar based. It's the biggest AI project in the history. It will take time...  
\- Whatever you mentioned above will be delivered in 2-3 years. Which will still be ages before anyone else.   
\- They literally reinvented battery if you have seen the battery day presentation.   


The list goes on.   


Even if your statistically inaccurate claim of Musk delivering 5/100 great things, that's still 5 more great things than anyone else doing. Great things take time when you are doing it with honestly.   
Rest of the industry is trying to ride the EV wave. They are all gonna fail like Nikola. Guaranteed.
Even more fun when u are also leveraging.

Yeah. Reading through it, it also says “The specifics of the plan state that as of 2035, 50% of new cars sold in the country will be either electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles, and 50% of new cars will be conventional hybrids, which still run entirely on gasoline.”

So only 50% will be “gas” hybrid. Also, as China moves more towards EV, the article also mentions there will be less demand for gas and as such gas stations will close, etc. So either case, the “pure” gas cars will be gone by 2035.

And as I said. How many hybrid cars is Toyota producing right now per year? 

And if there is this 50/50 divide, NIO/XPEV/LI aren’t even direct competitors as they are on different sides of that 50/50.
just added them, not sure what happened. sorry bout that!

Phenomenal analysis l, do you have past charts that show this same pattern and the dates of those significant dip and strong bullish action leading to this point and the aftermath after this point?  We can factor in economic changes/presidential elections/world catastrophic events etc...

Yeah I know u need such a big move to be profitable on puts it’s actually insane lol 😂 I think it’s cause it’s known they would go down big lol. I am also not a hater and made good money on some of the shitty one like solo but it’s getting way too high imo. You Sound like a smart guy what are you playing? I took profit today so I am looking for a play lol
These are all terrible haha
Exited all PLTR today; the meme is over...
It's just an opportunity for the media to bait readers into getting mad at someone in Trump's cabinet. That money was not being used anyways.
Godspeed friend!

This is the most expensive market in modern history factually. You clearly have no idea what you are talking about.  This market is objectively more expensive than the dot com market.

im up 20%+ this week even after today

what the fuck are you playing???
Doing this on NIO. Selling weeklies that are out of the money by 2 dollars.  Making the 200 in stock appreciation,  plus the premium.  Going very well for me.  Strongly recommend.
Mall shootings because schools are closed I guess.

Someones gotta do it. Its your turn this time.
I was told SQ was supposed to be worth $300 per share. If we could do that in the next 3 days that would be great.

359c for 11/23 ahah
If it's like all the other stocks it'll be worth 30+ in a couple months. I'd say it's better to buy it rn than regretting not buying a week from now
Monday ?
I just buy shares and then sell put and buy calls if I’m bullish
GRWG. Was at $14 about a month ago and is at a steady $30 now. They sell cannabis grow supplies and have a pretty massive market share. They also just acquired another large chain of stores so they are going up and through the roof once Biden can get rolling on national legalization.

The antithesis of wsb
Agree. But this trend has been going on for months and it hasn’t impacted the market. Now that there is a path forward I don’t think the market will turn full bear. I think we are slowing going to slide with unexpected pumps. December is going to be wild!
Puts on that guy's brain.
Fuck cab - drink a Super Tuscan or a Beaujolais Gamay. Same price, better wine.
Baba is still honestly undervalued at these prices. Baba is basically the amazon of China and it will be increasing these following years. This bad news incident that made it dip hard was a blessing in disguise.

Faust is a good california cab available at wegmans. $50 a bottle but good value

The first thing that pops up typing in will china ban gas cars. Idk we can talk about Scandinavian countries all we want but not even close to a majority of the market will have gas vehicles banned
100 prolly for 2020. It wont quit.
Money needs to clear into your account before you sell the shares. They haven't been paid for yet.
I kinda like calls on CLX right now, but I missed the dip under 200. I think the market has been too optimistic about how long it will take to get the regular economy firing on all cylinders.

All it takes is a little push for sentiment to swing back in the form of the vaccines not being as effective due to covid strain mutations or some shit. Q1 2021 ERs are still gonna be shit for a lot of companies and things aren't gonna swing back on a dime as soon as restrictions and everything are lifted. Consumer sentiment is gonna be important too, depends if people bust out and start blowing cash immediately or if they hesitate until everything looks clear for a while
Ahh I see so doing things that follow very sequential and obvious steps where each input leads to a specific output. 

I guess. 

So I guess the question is whether or not a robot can design another robot then. Which the answer is no. 

Also, no way any robot drives better than a human right now.

I lost that same amount in a week earlier this month and I'm overwhelmed by how easy it was to lose and how long it will probably take to get back (if ever). F in the chat ❤️
Oh, really? Thanks for telling me! I’ll edit it. But yeah, I’ll be opting out then.
Yes I have some calls for December so I'm hoping runs. IPOB looks like a good bet too if you want to diversify
Bro that XOM strike is way fucking too high
So, 300 BILLION market cap? Fucking retard Lmao
Yeah, I've seen their numbers, and I've seen people yelling they are the next Tesla for all the wrong reasons. I have a small stake in them, but I'm not going all in.
jacked to the tits with calls here. $20k SUMO LEAPS and $40k shares in my IRA
don't follow analysts. most want it to get back to $10 so they can double up.
You are obviously a moron and know nothing.

"Hold" 

They are fucking options you idiot.
🌈
Thabk you man. Some huge paper handed mistakes. I made some bad plays but almost all those losses along the way were gains that I traded out of. I stubbornly decided to hold baba calls longer through the dip and average down because I didn't want to end on a loss and watch baba moon. 

I even held $25 CRSR calls expiring today that would have been $13 in the money but I sold them Monday for more baba calls that bled to almost $0 lol.
I really wonder what their top will be. Seems unstoppable
At first glance I thought that was a cop about to flog that girl

Had lunch with my GFs parents, was kinda talking stonks with her dad and he told me I need to read The Intelligent Investor. I was talking about clean energy plays now that Bidens taking over and dude cuts me off mid sentence and tells me "Biden's not taking office. There were fraudulent votes."

ICLN $5p 1/21

Same. Next on the menu is THCB for next week
I have a bad habit of making good gains for the day then selling and rolling over my profits into the same upward trending stock at the top and then it dips. My downfall to this game is greed because I get way too aggressive and impatient
And perhaps most importantly it’s their brand, they can get into a bunch of the innovative industries blooming rn and they’d have an automatic advantage just because they’re Tesla. 

We’re in a different world than the bubbles of the past, they shouldn’t be compared

I’m glad that as a member of this sub I could help you achieve your goals and help you become successful, with this being said please remember that without us you wouldn’t have a milly I’ll take my 10% cut

Thank you in advance
LEAPs are just long dated contracts. If you aren't trading spreads, your contracts need to be long dated or else you suffer serious theta decay.

Investopedia puts it at a year. But honestly you should buy 3 - 6 month minimum, particularly if your market timing is shit. Most of this sub would do well to buy more time. Worst case scenario is you make money early with a long dated contract.

I bought a $30C on CRSR which expires next spring. Already tripled in value in like...a week. And I have no pressure to sell because theta is virtually nothing, especially because it's so far ITM.

That is the non-retard way to use options leverage if you don't want to trade shares.

lol, your really going to enjoy the next chapter in life. High school-college tons of friends. Friends start getting married and you lose touch of those friends. Then you get married and your wife or whatever will want you to mingle and hang out with other married couples. Of course this leads to dinners with some friend your wife really likes and you have to have small talk with her friends dipshit husband. Every time it’s the same bland convo “what do you do for work?” He responds “oh I’m in accounting at (enter retarded company name)” and I says “oh that’s REALLY SUPER interesting”. Then you talk about sports and then usually I start looking at my phone while the wife and her friend cackle like retarded hyenas and drink wine. Since this is actually happening right now it’s time for me to put my phone down and try to talk to this dildo some more and hopefully I’m outta here within the next hour.
Hundreds? 😂
Directly short (small positions) on NASDAQ and 50% cash
So what do i buy?
100$ scratchers
They do have to disclose *all* known or perceived shareholder risks. I imagine this is pretty common language for recent IPOs.

That said - I’d rather own F the NKLA.
I’ve been trying to get into wine and really like cabs. I just figured something “fancy” from my birth year (96) would be pretty cool for celebrating with. Any suggestions?
AAPL is literally on its support line at 117 if it breaks come Monday we may see a 110.

It’s the people asking for tips on how to spend their money that drive me insane. Or people needing emotional support on whether or not to sell a contract. Stop putting the responsibility on us and learn how to blow up your account with your own poor decisions.

No, I won't have that, sorry. Price consolidation is a basic reality about how markets work. When it breaks, it breaks. I am not claiming to know the next move
Don't! I sold NIO Monday because I was $-2,000. Probably the dumbest decision of my life, but I'm new and still learning. If I didn't have paper hands I would be up $25,000 right now.

Personally, I wouldn’t wait until Thursday or Friday though. If I see a strong spike early on Monday that puts me back green I’m going to take my profits.

NKLA is trading at 26.50 a share, with a market cap a third of Ford's. The company has no actual product and no revenue. It's facing class action lawsuits, an SEC investigation, and grand jury subpoenas by the department of justice. 

On December 1, the company's lockup agreement expires and approximately 161 million shares of common stock will become eligible for sale. 

The company's 10Q says the following:


"Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact its price."

I obviously could be wrong, and I usually am, but i think they are blasting off one last pump to find some bagholders before the share price dunks. Get your puts next week. Price target $10 in the near term. 


The 10Q

Done on purpose. If he was cold and calculating, he would be seen as a threat. He puts on a retarded front to keep himself and his family safe.

Ain’t going to get clicks watching that. Been saying all that shit online is bullshit. Most people are super chill but that doesn’t get views. Fucking Karens and people doing dumb shit do. I’ve just stopping watching or clicking that stuff as it just supports it even if you trash it. Clicks are clicks.

Fux yea boi. My 267.5 dec4 is already almost itm
Lol! Actually I did buy 100 and it did pump 5% from when I opened so I set a trail stop at 5% which triggered so I basically broke even and locked up 2k in funds for 2 days since I don’t use margin 🤡😂
I’m not sure either but I know my kids talk about it a lot and that it would be a competitor to Unity. I could see it getting that autistic strength though.

Yes this is how stocks work
Corona will be irrelevant by the end of 2021. Big money HD, LOWE, Clorox, etc. investors know that, thus will not pay for more for the stock knowing that will be the case. 

Tech investors are in the here and now. Those investors are still pricing their stocks like Corona will never end.

You mean gains? Cause right now It's gains.
I honestly think, given low expectations, Q3 might be decent. If it does dip, might be the last buying opportunity pre Q4. Either way, shit is going down December 8 for GME!
Haha nah. 
I kept chasing weekly's throughout the years... was trying to go even for so long. 

Almost got it right in april with some savvy trading on Activision and irobot. 

But hit a huge bump down when they announced closures. 

Hopped into some hexo 1 dollar calls and surprisingly got back to 9k..   but... I failed to sell due to diamond hands. 

Always take profits I guess.

Have any of you ever tried to play roblox? I downloaded it on my iPad for my kid the other day after listening to you chodes go on about how its going to make shitloads of money, and it was the most non intuitive and lame piece of shit I have ever experienced. Every youtube video about it had some gay autistic 20 year old screaming at their Webcam about nonsense so I couldn't figure out wtf to do and gave up. I dont have much faith in it after my attempt to play it went nowhere. I might be slightly retarded, but I feel like games should still be easy to at least start playing even for a retard.
Everyone here thinks ev bubble gonna pop soon but when Joe B focuses on green energy they gonna do another leg up

Because you creating a box position is not the same as a failure of the trade to settle. You can close a box position yourself and make the funds available to trade.
How we feel about SHOP? Got a nice return early in the week but didn't buy back in like a retard.. thinking about getting in again monday
After turkey day
Nothing.
I doubted my PTON calls on Wed and sold after buying at the bottom and watched it moon the past 2 days.
Definitely would make the strike farther otm. Lock in the smaller premium as these things will be worth a lot I think
Haha almost like someone who bought in at $15
Dont be afraid to take profit my dude.

This thread is amazing lol: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxtjqi/buying\_pltr\_dip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxtjqi/buying_pltr_dip/)
They are at the end of phase 3 trials. They published data 2 days ago saying that 208 of 209 patients that received 2 shots had antibody levels that fully neutralized covid19.  That 1 patient still had an immune response. So for this type of experiment AZ got >99% effect and moderna got 80%. I would bet, and I did, that they will see close to 100 efficacy and will report within weeks.
I lost that on a single trade.
Like what?
oh, who tf knows I just have June calls I need to print
Kinda sounds like an adderall epiphany
Got 3 calls dialed up for 1/15/21. A $300C $315C and $325C. Already up bigly
Absolutely
"your butt then you can have my butt"

its a fair exchange.
wish it had more liquidity in the options market.
No not really. That’s such an incredible generalization. The market is made up of a plurality of up seven or so companies, maybe one or two of which are slightly overvalued, with yes Tesla being beyond recognition. 

Using some actual perspective helps in these situations. Amazon is a relative value right now. Facebook is an absolute steal. And if the market corrects, Holy shit I’m going to be buying the mother living shit out of those two. And those aren’t the only ones. People still don’t understand how slack works really, and once they do that shit is going to blow the fuck up.

The reason people have this misconception that the market is overvalued, and even more incredible, that it’s anything close to.com, is because they keep focusing on the ridiculous meme stocks. But those aren’t the stocks that I’m buying, and maybe I’m missing out, but I won’t be in 30 years when I’m rich as shit because I made wise investment decisions.
STOP THE COUNT
Hopefully they start going back up. I’ve got 12/18 calls for both that are down about 30% right now.
10K gain on stocks and 2.5K gain on options haven’t been enforced in ages idk why
What if BABA was nothing but a bull-trap so MM collect premium.
Looks to me like you’re going to break even

Fuck, it didn’t hit 14, lol might get banned. But I do think we will hit 400 as well. Just a little nervous if Cohen doesn’t buyout GME before expiration. What do you think? I’m predicting he buys right after earnings
Welcome to the fund
cool thanks!
No, y'all still don't get it. The market for these devices does not give a shit about the price. They could be $5000 each and it would not matter. These folks have the money.

I mean I think most people will get it but yeah bump that up to $10k and I'll get the rabies vaccine too.

Sold my last position in my portfolio 11/27 $265c today for a nice 100+% gain. 

Might jump back in next week. I sold higher than where my contract ended up end of day and would have had theta eating away all weekend. 

Things are different when the one call you have is your entire portfolio lol. Easier to hold when you can handle the loss. Also probably just gonna pull out because I have real world applications for that money.

I told myself. If it goes above $19, sell and buy back more shares lower. What did I do? Sat there like a dumbfuck all day staring at my casino app and didn't do shit.
Recover Stocks going down next week. More bleeding from BA, Airlines, Cruise etc. Recovered too fast. I think MTN looks like a great one to short/put. It is over its price before Covid. Don't know how it is more valuable with all the uncertainty.

Cycle back to Tech - In ZM, FSLY, GME, LOGI, Baba, Amzn, NIO, PLTR, Ostk (been really beat up until the last couple day) etc.

We will see Monday. I think it will be red, but Tech will be up. I was up 5% today, 10% before Options Friday Sell off.
TLDR; BIGLY up maybe but also down
What’s the best strat for this? Buy shares and then puts to cover in case it drops?

No, he told Elon Musk that humans would never create an \[AI\] ("animal") that is smarter than a human, to which Elon musk "very much disagreed". Big difference. I think computers/AI can become smarter than humans, and actually way, way smarter.

what do you mean when people find out it's fake?
Bad earnings from lowes: they have increased costs because of rona. Do you pay attention at all?
If it takes a war to fix all the bullshit trump has done, so be it, I'm all in PLTR
Lol have fun pal
OP found the money printer
I held through the dip and end of day. 

It has a tiny float. I’ve been saying this everywhere but it needs to hit the 30s before it matches SOLOs market cap and it has US production benefits, a deal with Karma and a product that has sold into federal government (in small numbers).

Do your own DD and know there is a ton of risk - but I think it has a nice long positive ramp if you can keep steady.

It’s because people realize Tesla is the next apple / amazon.  You’re gonna feel like a moron for not buying in years from now.

Sorry for late reply, but it was mentioned in a Marketwatch article at the same time Soros announced he was pulling out. Too lazy to find the link now, but it gave the impression she may also have ethical qualms.

Jokes on you, i got out even and yolo'd $baba calls 

Doubled my money since that comment :)
Every time I sense this kind of fear we gap up. That’s why I bought 10 SPY $370C 11/27 today
Still time.  Apple and amazon have both been fucking broken.
I didn’t but I did research and I figured the Chinese government is backing this company and would want to compete with Tesla. So it makes sense I would at least break even taking the risk
Now now, you cuck.

Bought at 18.5 on the climb up on Tuesday. Theta is only .04 but since then it's had it's swings back and forth. Wednesday seemed kinda bad bouncing off support and never breaking resistance but yesterday and today have been good. Momentum is good going into next week. I've been saying it's a healthy, stable stock and the rsi is there to prove it. Just missed out on some other sweet plays this week since my position is pretty big on pltr.

12/18 40c I bought a few days ago already up 40% then today I bought as many 45 12/18's as I could afford. Already up 1.18% AH so I think I did well for once. As far as the top... I have no idea. I am not a smart man. But I own corsair pc equipment and their customer service is top notch so I'm in.

The weekly Tesla bubble chart (+S&P500), surely?
Bro that call will print how about Pltr 30s next week
Social reject here.
Its true
When the rug pull happens you’ll think there’s another leg down incoming and be too afraid to yolo.
Tsla down today bud.
Buddy, you came to the wrong sub to complain about autists.
Your wife’s boyfriend might put up with you whining like a lil bitch, but take that shit somewhere else
Bye
get rich and enjoy having zero attention
Think they will hit double digits next week?
wonder why🤔
Just explain to her how small your dick is so it won’t hurt as much
Woah, don’t go overboard with those printers
Inovio would be the best but FDA being gay
I trimmed some of my position but am still long and confident in long-term.
*short dated calls
Any guesses on how earnings will play out? I have a somewhat large share position in hopes that RC and Burry will make some moves and shift it to the right direction. And of course the squeeze
Imma tell the girl i’m talking to i’m a derivatives analyst and show her the account i’m green on not the one i’m down -90% on 😎
This wouldn't effect you unless you have a short position. Sounds like you have a long position (you own GME shares).
Roblox and DoorDash for me
Good call on the BABA Yetu song.  
BABA and CIV 4 LYF!
You got it all wrong. Short interest is not falling, market caps are rising. taps head
WTRH  


Food delivery company. States are going under lockdown. It has 10K employees. Price only 3.8$ per stock as of now. If I had 3K$, I'd put into WTRH. Unfortunately, I only have 550$ so I have yolo'ed all of it in WTRH
Red rkt
of course its an ev tech bubble im talking about including those especially nio
Do they still do physical stock certificates? I want to gift everyone 1 share of NKLA.
Cranium size checks out
Shorting PLTR at 10am after it gets its morning wood should be pretty easy money tbh

Xeekend Xow up bigly 1.6 points
Just ask her how her last boyfriend convinced her.
Not should they
I don’t think so buckaroo
Tell her you let a few guys do it to you and it wasn’t so bad so you don’t know what she’s making a big deal about
Fuck yes TLS LETS GO BABY
if you actually expect sizeable stimulus to pass with a republican senate i've got some tulips to sell you
taking a large position in baba long dated calls. talk me out of it. thanks
As long as you're selling the call for more than you paid for the stock, preferably at less than .30 delta, I think it's a great way to increase return.
Wait 10 year for the next crash clown
I hate how close it looks to NIO, but I’m 100% serious here. Check these guys out, I really think they are primed to rip.  Compared to the other EV companies that get talked about, these guys are WAY undervalued.  Do your own research here, and good luck!
He sold..
Idk it limits your upside, and sometimes I exercise calls early when they’re just barely at the break even just to fuck with the person who sold me the call.
Bro it didn’t start from a bat, it was created in a laboratory 100%

Spoiler alert: Santa isn't real.
I think most electronics have a plug
They have a ton of competitors. They just happen to do what no one else can, Raytheon or any of the other large defense companies cannot keep up. Their only disadvantage is their high price.
I mean that is fair and i can average down if tech runs up a little further. But where is the nasdaq going to go to? It is meeting fat resistance at 12,000 I seriously dont think it will run much past that. It is not worth trying to time it perfectly I think it is just safe to bet that the nasdaq will take a serious dip in a years time.
GUH

Look at the gains on KXIN for calls lolololol holy shit
Another weekend, where I impatiently wait for Mondays.  
At least I've got so much work to do, it'll fucking race past.
A lot of unusual options activity for Tech made today. Sweep purchases for QQQ 300c/340c, GOOGL 1750c/1780c, NFLX 500c/550c, MSFT 225c. Fucking AMZN 4150c. All of these were made in the last hour of trading, with the cost ranging from $1MM to $5MM. The expiry is for 1-2 years, but that’s likely to limit their vega exposure. These boys are all about that delta.
Chill, it will go up next week. Stocks always go up
Buy more. $ 1000 per share!!!
Ugh yeah...

Bitfinex, an exchange operator, also operates Tether, the digital currency that claims that is backed 1-1 with to USD. 

They have no oversight and refuse to be audited by public accountants. There is a lot of evidence against them showing that in fact Tether isn’t backed by any USD, and they are printing infinitely. Evidence suggests that they were scammed prior, so in order to pay liabilities they started printing Tether infinitely. New York DA publicly released the email exchanges between Bitfinex/Tether employees and the scammer that ghosted them. Their only public “audit” was from a consultant that said “this is not an audit” on the actual documentation.

US authorities have had trouble prosecuting Bitfinex/Tether as they’re incorporated in the Cayman islands. Tether/Bitfinex doesn’t really deny any of the accusations, their defense is that they’re outside the US and US authorities can’t go after them.

Just look at Tether’s market cap/volume with other currencies... they are printing to infinity. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/
With that kind of money and you went all in on options, just set aside like 1k per option play on a heavy dipped large cap or play with a cheap stonk at least 6months out, put rest on stonks(etf). Gg
Will EVs keep running or will there be a pullback next week?
Baba calls. Way undervalued for no reason.

Ur right about NIO.....but I THINK you could time shorting it by using the only useful TA indicator: RSI.
Electronics and clothes is easy money if you have a plug
Please tell me you aren’t here for the “stop the steal” shit lol
To many positions to post.
Trading call contracts is a bitch!!!
Split my portfolio evenly into three stocks. FCEL, TLS, and PLTR. I really don't know what the fuck I'm doing

I bet against America with spy puts 😌last time I try doing that. The bear life is not for me 
I'm also retarded
This happened back when Agent Orange was still raping our troops, a plane hit two big towers in chicago, and Kennedy got trickshotted, where u been?

Not to mention it was a technical glitch, he wasn’t actually in debt making the story much bigger than it is.
Options or shares???? (:
I do because I have no idea if I bought the right stock at the right time.  20 delta at least 2 weeks out.  If ITM and don’t want to lose roll up and out for a small credit if you can.  I been struggling with that on DOCU and did today with BABA.  Now I have a 12/4 182c.  Probably in trouble on that one.

It is December 21st. So long as the stock trades above $12 every day for 20 days beginning December 1st, pre-IPO investors can sell their shares. Ergo, December 21st.

The OC on this sub is the absolute best. Keep it up retards!
The world is a much better place once you’re able to PDT. Good gains, dude.
how did you get burned? Just need to buy puts immediately after announcement and then sell for a gain
I would probably always write some wayyyy OTM calls for a few extra bucks but there's good argument that CC won't help you long run.
If it’s a fast growing stock u plan on keeping long term, I would think twice. Because If u really believe in its growth it may not be worth jeopardizing it over a little extra cash. Something like PLTR or NIO for example.

But if it’s a slow steady one, then u might as well

They were $0.8. I bought at close so it's almost the lowest possible price this week (0.7 was lowest). The weeklies got IV crushed throughout the day because NIO stayed flat. We're in mania phase so it's a decent lotto. Also huge flows today into 11/27 60Cs. SOLO AYRO XPEV all pumped hard today, just looking for NIO to catch up, but not a YOLO, just play money

People on this sub: have fun getting wiped, it will be $10 at open on Monday 🤡
Do you still plan on playing CRSR or do you think it won’t grow as much anymore?
How could you be down fam? It literally went up 20% in the last week
Both pfizer and nio dropped during that time. Nio was a roller coaster and if you didnt sell at the right time, you either had to hold or sell. Because I trailed nio at 3% loss, I ended up buying into SBE 20% and ARKK 50% while keeping 30% open waiting to buy in dip. Today I gained roughly 12%, so i made the right play.

Recent plays: I repurchased nio (risky) at $48 (15%). I believe itll spike monday and drop wednesday. Pfizer is probably going to open monday 3% up but the market closed before I could buy. My miss.

yep, just stoplosses are important in any case, never know

Oh haha good point.
Monday at 4pm eastern of course!  But IBKR will force a liquidation at 3:45pm on unfavorable terms, so really, 3:45pm Monday since I do not have the capital to exercise these.
Why are you trying to pump a stock already at ATH? Wait for a pullback. It’s a buy below $40.
It was a peak but it won't be the peak
You should have bought 20
Bruh moment
No it’s not. It’s not. Why would you even think this. It’s definitely not. I’m probably right. The chances are so small. It’s probably not. I don’t think it was. I guess it could have been. There may be a chance. Seem likely. Odds are it was. I guess you’re right.
If you're too stupid to connect wedding venue industry and restaurant industry both being in the hospitality industry then yeah, go right ahead and weigh in!
Lots of instos and funds been buying though not just retail, highly doubt that a full on rug pull happens

Worst case it just becomes a boring boomer stock
This is the biggest problem I have. I don't know when to lock in gains vs ride something long. I am only opening otm or slightly otm long calls, but as soon as I'm green I usually sell. What's a good target % gain to pull?
And boomers.

Guys good news. Market gonna be flat next two weeks.
If your repost prompts a newbie trader to try and understand what they are doing BEFORE doing it, then I guess drudging this tragedy back up is warranted.

Don’t know how to buy leaps or sell CC against them
Know your risk - reward and your own risk level. Also no emotions.. don’t linger on missed gains because you are not a magic 8 ball. Don’t get panic when the market is shit. I find trading breakout stocks have better RR. Buy high and sell higher because there’s a trend. And don’t think 100%-300% gain is common.. it is not.. have a target of smaller percentage gain and scale out. If you want to score 100%, leave 1 contract on the table and set a stop loss. Find some meme stocks.. meme stocks work because there’s a trend. But don’t get greedy. When you find everyone is on this train, maybe it is time to jump off. And have a few stocks that you are familiar with the movements.
I didn’t sell shit today I’m going for 200%
Lol yep. And just because it's the future doesn't mean SOLO or KNDI will end up being successful. That's why TSLA is such a premium stock and sustained itself even after going batshit insane. Big money knows that it is extremely well positioned and has things in line to dominate this industry.

What sucks though is that the premiums on options for these companies are absurd. I was looking at SOLO options right now and even buying expirations a month or two from now carry an IV of 250ish. Not worth it, imo because you just don't get much back for your investment. People still buying options on this shit aren't just playing with fire, they're playing with nukes.

I'm not a hater either lol. I didn't YOLO on this shit, but I made some nice tendies. It's just too risky now
If your as bad at trading as you are at karma whoring then you should prolly follow the rookie trader off the building.
found this company today, opened a small position and planning to add more in the coming weeks
Are you saying "Don't have emotions. Don't have diamond hands."? Because I'm saying "Have em' both. Go get em' kiddo!"

Thoughts on PTON and TLRY??
Hahah....couldn’t have happened to a better guy
Not that they'll stop shopping online altogether, but people will have more options, and won't be afraid of leaving the house, so they'll buy a little less online instead of damn near everything. I'm not saying Bezos will be selling handies under a bridge or anything. Just that their year over year for q3 21 will probably be worse than q3 20, and while they're still going to make an assload of money, it will be a slightly smaller assload n that makes stonks go down.
Looking at their market cap of 34bn currently. I think they could go to a price range 100-150 in 4 years. So your 20k would go to 100ish. I hope my projections are totally low ball as I'm holding too @16
Agreed. I won’t be hibernating this winter.

Don’t ever enter a trade without a plan of what you expect to happen. The way I go about it is figure out where I expect the stock to go, what my contracts will be worth at that point and when I’m going to cut losses if things go bad. If you follow this strictly surprises will generally come to the upside. Hardest part is cutting losses and giving up on a trade. That’s why I went to monthly trades and I’ll buy into them over a few days/ weeks so I can average down any drops and not have to cut losses like I would if I went all in at once. Example I now have 25 GDX 1/21/22 contracts first five buys were $3.10 my last five were $85 and my average is now 1.40 I plan on getting 25 more but if I had bought 50 at once I would’ve already cut out and had a loss or be holding a MASSIVE fkn bag. This isn’t a good example because I should’ve cut out several times instead of averaging down but retard gonna retard.
I just made both a roth and a traditional today , so I’m gonna make 6 more accounts to trade regularly to grind up to 25k thanks a lot

BABA healthy green in AH. I wanna believe that's a good sign meaning I did well by not cashing out anything today
13.41 high is what i'm tracking. And thank fuck I sold right then. I'd been diamond handing GME for a few months and the ceiling today just barely managed to cover almost all my losses, and then lo and behold an hour later (and throughout the rest of the day) it dropped back down. To which I promptly put all of my money back into it.

If it doesn't run on earnings, I will be nervous about the january calls, but I feel very strongly that it will because of what is going on with Cohen.  Possible that I might sell a few calls if we run up a lot before earnings (16-18 a share), but probably not, and if I did, it would be the little batch of december 18th calls I got this week (dec is risky though, be warned)

That’s not the reason bud. We rejected ATH three times and the outflows out of the biggest names have been huge. Smart money has been flowing out for months and retail just put up another 2 billion. The dollar is gaining strength and money is moving into the 10 year yield. By all means just think it’s only opex day and we should be bullish. Busted out stimulus hopes 4 times and didn’t save the market. One bearish catalyst over the weekend and we will see a huge down day.

OK well now you're kind of shifting the goal posts to basically saying all of the stock market, or at least all of tech, is in a bubble. Which also may be true. If you want to short the market, short the market.

But that's separate from whether Tesla should be worth more than all other car companies combined.

welcome to the club! I have been buying pull backs ever since they released this video on earnings day & its been Green days since. Just be long term & dont be sad/nervous when it goes into Red.

The beauty of this is that people set the price for the stock, not some dirtbags that price the stock high ass shit and dump it on IPO like SNAP or Uber stock.

It's actually a good chunk less since they also have the premium collected on the sale; if you want to buy shares this is the way to do it.  Of course, yeah, it's a fuck-ton of money regardless.

What are you looking at that would suggest we see 370 anytime soon? Bonds and DXY are looking ripe for a big move and a massive short squeeze. While equities continue to correct. Imo we hit sub 320 in short order and we will be looking at 370 sometime in the spring/summer.
The play here is to go 100% all in, and then sell after 2 weeks and buy HUGE PUTS.

Etrade could for a different reason (if you go in margin on other things and they tank).

ETrade will not take your shares from you for this though, you own those shares.  What I'm talking about here are short positions.  If you have 100 shares, Etrade may be lending those out to short sellers, since they have to sell a share to open up that position. Etrade gets an interest rate from the person that borrows it.  When the person with the short position goes to close it, they have to buy shares to replace yours.

If you wanted to vote, you would have to recall your shares to do so, meaning the person borrowing your shares for the short position would get closed out without their consent.

It is a little more complicated than that, but that is the gist - your shares are safe, its the people that shorted the stock that are at risk of having their position closed.

I got shares. Up 50%, I told myself we still haven’t seen Black Friday nor cyber Monday nor Christmas yet. So hype could continue. I looked at the MC of razer ( I hate them) they sit around 3billion USD. So CRSR is higher however CRSR has 1 billion in revenue versus Razers 450 million. So I can still see it growing. I don’t expect it to beat Logitech in MC (13b) for obvious reasons so if the MC gets close to 4B for CRSR I’d say it’s fairly valued, however there are some people very bullish on Logitech and have price targets stupidly high compared to what it’s at now. For now I think CRSR still has room to run. But once the MC hit between 4-5B I’d start taking profits

TLDR:
-Room to run
-4-5 Billion MC in short term estimating 45-50$/shAre short term if things keep going but it’s definitely getting a bit hot.
Almost 100% of the trades I've made the last few weeks have lost me money

There are options day traders that already do this, buying atm options and scalping. Risky, but the options are at their cheapest and they’re holding them for a few minutes at most. 

It’s interesting that RH is doing this right after some other brokerages, like Fidelity, did the opposite and now prevent same day expiry options to be purchased unless your account value is greater than $1 mil.
Why the hell does this micro cap even have options
well that was a big red limp dick power hour...

This is 5 months old, were you living under a rock dude?
What the fuck... These contracts are cheap as fuck am I missing something? 12/4 19c are literally .01 per share.....

I'm looking at the chart, why did it sell-off sharply 2 weeks ago?
It doesn’t change any rules. It’s just a way to circumvent the “punishment” or like I said, you can alternate accounts when one has 3 day trades and you don’t want to get PDT restricted but still want to daytrade using a margin account

Allows for much more frequent day trading. I guess PDT ban can be completely ignored using this but it’s quite easy to get it removed or you could transfer to a different brokerage
Loaded some 55Cs. Hope it catches up to XPEV Monday
where can i cop a 5 bagger
GEX goes down. Stonks go up! Isn't that how it works?
Roaring 20's would have been awesome for trading stonks

Y’all think BABA will hold or just dump next week?
Lmao how did he not get it earlier? Didn't both his girlfriend and dad get it?
I left $10k on the table for getting out too soon. Calls or shares that you buy and forget about.

Thanks for the reply. With all the EV momentum lately, following trends really sunk in lately. I kept anticipating a move to “value” stocks and it just hasn’t happened.
That iv is pretty high tho.
tldr?
The 12/18 BABA 300C actually looks like a good position.

You sure it’s not supposed to be 11/27 BABA 600C?
SOLO will be destroyed imo. People didn't even seem to notice that it dropped over 20% from its high today.

CRSR is not overvalued though and I think that play is a loser unless the market drills all around.
Lost it all this past couple weeks continually buying the baba dip. 

Sold my last position in my portfolio 11/27 $265c today for a nice 100+% gain. 

Might jump back in next week but I sold higher than where my contract ended up end of day and would have had theta eating away all weekend. 

Things are different when the one call you have is your entire portfolio lol.

It seems like Every fucking stock has no problem moving $5-$10 like nothing and this shit just bounces from $20-$22
Sorry to hear that my man. Good on you for doing that though.. that’s nice to hear
DIX flat, and GEX down. Rally next week?
Could be worse. You could be like me and have bought 10k worth of shares at $14 instead of leaps 😔
Investors in these companies don’t understand profitability, market potential, and growth. They just see the stock going up and buy. 

I wouldn’t try to time it. Ride the wave until the euphoria stops. Weed bubble lasted for quite some time before it popped. Same with digital currency, although it’s rallied a lot recently primarily because of blatant fraud.
If it can stay above 15 I'll make money :)

You need to delete the idea that institutional money = smart money. Maybe in the near term it's a worthwhile signal, but do not think for a second that institutions aren't just playing the same exact game retail is. Everyone is just trying to catch the wave, institutions get rekt just the same as retail in a downturn/correction/bubble pop.

I YOLO'D from solo into titan pharmaceuticals this morning and had a bad time. Feeling dumb as fuck. No tendies for me tonight. Dont deserve it.
Fair enough as a hedge, and a year out gives it time to go into profit.  I'm not in tech atm, but as we get more lockdowns and especially if biden launches the 6 weeks of lockdowns as soon as he enters office that his team has talked about, tech is going to run again regardless of how stupidly they are valued.

Tesla makes most of its money on car sales now, but people investing in it are investing based on the future, not now.  And it is a cult like following.

Hope it works out for you, but it seems like a bad idea to buy those right now
You must go to Illinois and lock down immediately.
Most likely this is a spread and he's not showing the buys that covers it. Robinhood doesn't let you sell puts without collateral

Decide when to pull out before going in. You have to analyze how the stock will change in price and try to imagine every outcome. When you reach the goal you have set do not think twice, cash out.

go to the roblox website sometime. They are not 1 game, like GTA and Fortnite. They are a library of user created games. If the plat form is anything, it's closer to garry's mod for kids. They give you a library of stuff and say "have fun".

There are so many different kinds of games and they're all user voted. If your game stinks, it sinks to the bottom of the list and people dont play. If it's good, more people play. It is always generating it's own new thing. It by definition can not get stale because it's all user generated and crowed voted.

I lost my ass April-June stopped trading and learned as much as I could. Came back end of July followed strict rules and made it all back in August. Then broke every rule I was using and dumped into gold and silver and I’m losing my ass again lol. Rules that helped 1. Don’t buy on big green days (no chasing) 2. Average into positions if I want 20 calls buy 5 at a time 3. Monthly (swing) trades only never daily/ weekly 4. *THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT* If you go to the daily thread and the stock is mentioned in 50% or more of the comments do not enter and sell if you are already in.
I would rather split dat ass, dog.

It's possible. I'm not touching $AMZN for a while. September, and recentl vaccine news killed my calls I had. I will say however that we've seen random tech pumps on low volume days bc softbank imo, and Monday / Tues might pop off bc they are typically low volume days.
They’re the only profitable food delivery company and have been paying off debt the past few quarters while expanding. It’s the cheapest entry point into food delivery and this shit could run on DoorDash’s IPO buzz alone. Buy Jan 2021 calls or shares either way it’s got potential at a discount

I'm a Brit with bad teeth and no access to options so this is my YOLO. I've done very well on NET so this sits safely just beyond my risk tolerance.

Is it a bad sign I'm asking a drunk Autist if the company I'm balls deep in has critical Govt contracts? Maybe....
There is tons to be made in while its still by selling weeklies, but when it starts moving you're way better off just holding shares if you're risk adverse.  Holding shares is not casino style.

That said, April calls are the way ;)

Join the guard, learn how to be disciplined, then buy calls.
Good luck getting to a mili' with your 10 shares of AAPL breh. (Y)

Real talk though this is the problem.. it's fine and dandy to say "once i have a million i'll literally just make 1% a day and still have tons of money" but how you going to get there? Through fucking shares? Fuck no.. you need outsized returns nukka. Once you get there, fine, chill the fuck out. But in the meantime? Buy calls not shares homeboy.
donate, itll make you feel better than buying any shiny shit (id say go travel also but thats hard these days)
I think that seems logical but I have more faith in this BS market just pumping based on any vaccine news or something else. If not, RIP me. Pretty simple.

Big tech playing with my emotions rn.
Their income comes from a little thing called vendor lock in. Basically gvt AND commercial firms need that shit to make sense of the disgusting clusterfuck of a data landscape they've accumulated since the dawn of the computer. Because having a well organized IT landscape is some administrative shit for nerds, right? That's true but guess fucking what, data is more valuable than fuck and that will only increase.

No indicator is 100% reliable. But using them in conjunction with other indicators and technicals helps you get a better scope of where the market is trending and what price targets you can set for weekly/monthly trades. Also paying attention to macroeconomic trends help let you know how hedged you should be. I don’t know what will happen Monday, but it’s very likely that we will see SPY 370 before we retest 320

Yeah I totally agree. It’s definitely the futures and those are good companies but the prices got wayyy ahead of themselves you know what I mean? Companies like solo kndi and spi and shit had to go down big lol
Sometimes I cry afterward.
Sound analysis any time but this current enviroment. The virus/lockdown fear is back in play again. Check out the travel and oil sectors that dumped again after the initial vaccine euphoria and the wfh that rebounded for the same reasons. That is not strong forward looking behavior.

Either way, I'm not going far otm. 1.5% or so is def on the table.

Jerk off to my positions
It IPOd at the beginning of August, so it’d have to be later than that. You sure you didn’t buy around September 2? At its all time high? That would certainly explain the dramatic percentage loss for a mid December option. It would also be extremely autistic to do, and you’re posting this here, so... Right now the stock price is barely above its debut price back in August.

The most useful lesson you'll rarely hear is that you'll never make it big in one trade. Yes, somebody somewhere, that "Statistical" person will win and make it rich, but it's probably not going be you.

The market is a constant battleground, you'll need to win a few thousands well picked battles to make any real wealth. And by well picked I don't mean day trading like an idiot following hot tips online :) (hope that didn't offend anyone).

Bullish
There will be a lot of volatility since it's a hot/new/growth stock.  The less you look at it the less likely you are to panic sell. Just buy a bunch of shares and don't look at it for 2 years. Will be a 10 bagger.
Im salty i didn't atleast have a stoploss when it was up 4-5% at open, shoulda known better
So you believe we can keep this rate of stock prices growth for years without any significant pop?
Who are the alogos?
Uh no... algos are not foolproof
Aight good thanks fam
Guh
I know a guy who can turn that into $20.
Bullish imo. Atleast it didn't throw a flaming gas tank.
Pls

More than possible.  On a year where I did over $4million on the site I wasn’t even a top 200 seller.
I disagree with that overall. Biden’s admin is awfully hawkish though I do think we’ll see some wars of some kind. PLTR calls lul

Well they just got a $91 million contract with the Army and that’s now, if what happened under the Obama administration (up to 8 wars) happens under the Biden administration which isn’t hard to imagine there plenty of room for the PLtR contract to expand if the Army is happy with the service.
Very soon IMO. The EVs with nothing to offer will go down first. I'd still feel safe with money in the likes of NIO, Xpev, and Li tho. Probably see a pullback in those stocks, but they'll keep going up.

Kinda reminds me of what they said about the dotcom era when everyone and their mom had a .com company and people just FOMO'd in constantly. The market is still retarded, but I think it knows bubbles have to be popped sooner than later rather than risk destroying the whole thing. We will simply move on to the next meme
I’m in tune
$375
I mean if nio is any trend to look at, there'll be a dip before the end of next week, so not too late
Sounds like a reasonable plan actually lol I always pull out thinking it can’t get higher then now 😂😂

Quick update: I went from down 25% to up 15% today. Took all my capital off table and left my profit (two $260 1/15/21 calls) to let ride. Godspeed dude!
Remember when some of you cock mongers were saying BABA sucks it’s going sub 250 buy puts
eBay bought PayPal from Musk, etc for under $2Billion - then spun it off.  Probably one of the few missteps Musk has made
Yes after watching him loose 12k on Thursday I went and bought a nice chunk with my Tesla gains. I’ll leave that money there it’s already giving me a 12% return. I’m already buying it so cheap, I’ll legit leave it there.

This is the way
hard for plebs to swing the price around, so its mostly big boys buying the underlying. theyre also currently burdened by increasing operational costs with covid, in addition to antitrust issues preventing international expansion. there may be some uncertainty as to how amazons growth will scale out in a post covid world. probably not amazon is a bad pick so much as there's currently better pickings for gains.

I bought 100 shares the minute it IPO’d. Sold about 10 min later for like $84 profit. Should’ve held. I’m gonna hold mine for the long haul. Hoping this thing hits $100/share.
I think Trump was less bad though. Like how long until the next oil war at this point.

Wish is largely successful because it’s a bunch of Chinese trash (dirt cheap) sent via epacket (dirt cheap rates.) 

Although the product remains cheap the model is highly contingent on cheap shipping which is affected by a countries contracted rates on epacket by courier and political regulation that could alter terminal dues. The current model allows chinese distributors to utilize international shipping at rates below domestic for similar products. It’s subject to change and isn’t something the company controls so it’s worth looking into.
I like it.
The direction matters...and so does the velocity of the move...

Options are very low volume. I just float out bids at random prices and see if they fill for longest date $5-10 strike. Hold them. Then, exercise them like a real man. Buy shares, hold em, I expect a buy out longer term.

If you look at their chart this is the third time it’s popped ~275% and then fell back to around where it was before hand 1.30 → 3.50 → 1 → 4.50 → 2.50 → 10.50 and if what citron says is true SOLO seems to be way overvalued currently

When things get better, keep living the minimalist lifestyle even though your income goes up.  That's how you get rich.
Theoretically? Sure, it could potentially moon before then and you make a profit, it could have some really strong days and you might be able to recover some of the premium. Likely? Fuck if I know. If unemployment spikes without any stimulus or relief then I don’t know how many people will be buying a house. But at this point you can either sell and claim the tiny amount you have left in it or you can ride and hope for some recovery.
Valid! I don't trust the market conditions at all right now so I'm a bit skittish in general. But I definitely salivate at the potential of seeing a +2k% on a non-FD for sure

Gtfo boomer
Bro it's just numbers on a screen
Buy low sell high, I never buy while a stock is pumping. Use tech analysis to determine is something is oversold short term such as past month or past 3, for me I always cash out when I’m 200+ profit on a call or put. Don’t get greedy. If a stock still falls and it doesn’t make sense for it to be that oversold, I’ll double down. My favorite stock to trade is activision, a lot of up and downs and is predictable. Aside from activision is Microsoft, Facebook, and Tesla(occasionally).
Aren’t we all?

Fair, but I’ve been in long positions where I pulled out at 500% only to check back a couple weeks later and seen that they’re now up to 4,000% from what I bought them at.

Say you sell a 4.75 itm credit spread with a 5$ width max loss for a .25. assuming no early assignment, these options will decay as the stock moves in your favor and the width of the spread you sold to open will narrow down over time to something like 3-4$ at which point you close it. This is one of the the best risk reward strategies on paper but it’s not easy to fill

Then a cop pulled out to pull someone over a few vehicles behind me for talking on their phone, and I celebrated prematurely.

I ended up taking a sip from the Gatorade bottle rejoicing I didn't get pulled over, but took a large swig of my piss in the process. It was mildly salty. Did I win anything?

its highly possible
In that case, how about I drive and you ride shotgun to tendietown
How does everyone I know manage to only buy in March low and every dip but never has any position before the dip🤡
That’s my guess as well. Institutions likely know that a recession is coming, so they’ll hedge their positions while bidding up stock prices and let retail go wild on another “bull run”
Look at broke boi with no gains to pay taxes on
nice relaxing weekend of catching up on all the shit I should have been doing this week. Xanax, Rope, Garage

In ToS is an option under Order Type [Limit, Market(ask), Stoplimit, and Trailstop]. RH doesn’t offer these but I assume most major broker would. Allows you to set a market order when the [bid or mark] drops a certain value. It let you save your gains and focus on other things. It can get a little screwy on low volume options if the bid fluctuates wildly.
true, but if you don't take care of yourself you can't take care of others.

Big Daddy Thiel + EV Tech. SPAC merger slated for 12.1 (i think?). Merging company (Luminar) has contracts with UPS and Daimler backing and Thiel is an investor. 90+ patents being approved for LIDAR tech, currently being worked into Volvo production vehicles. They have LIDAR options for passenger vehicles, commercial trucking, robotaxi, and other things (like agricultural stuff). SPAC currently at 510M market cap, enterprise value should be closer to 3.5B. Look at these articles while drinking beers... cheers, tard.

There's probably no, or a ridiculously low ask price. The bid price will be higher than that. It's highly unlikely that if you put that price in it would execute - though it's theoretically possible that very, very rarely an algorithm will screw up and actually sell it at that price.

Find you one that’ll ride with you while you’re poor and you won’t feel like you’re only loved because of your PLTR YOLOs. It’s not that hard:

Step 1. Have attractive face
Step 2. Be at least less than chubby or moderately fit
Step 3. Have big pp
Step 4. Know a lot about a few very specific things so you come off as smart
Step 5. Have a plan to get your life together
Step 6. Get dog with girl
Step 7. Bro out with her father
Step 8. Anticipate the needs of her mother
Step 9. Always bring up how irresponsible you used to be so you can  do dumb shit like black out every other weekend but she still sees you “improved”
Step 10. Fall legitimately in love
Step 11. No kids

imagine doing that when SOLO was 13 or last week with NIO at 54
It would be 403 for the contract + 1250 
For $1653 

Versus just buying 100 shares for 1741 $1741. 

You would save about +- 90 dollars
Right now sure.As time goes on software, solar, battery, etc.  will take up more and more.  Also, just a matter of time before they start licensing or selling their tech/parts.

Soooooo is this still a potential case? I know it’s old and it seems consumer spending data is actually pretty positive right?
why is PLTR going down like a soft dick
I shouldn’t have sold like a paper handed little bitch for a 80% on my calls or sold the boomer shares I had for them when I was dipping. I’d be up 30% all time in stead of down 34% of all time.
It be like that sometimes
I really like this stock because people have a misconception regarding China that Trump instilled. People think these companies are scams & penny stocks. I think this company isn't garbage. It actually has a lot of users, and just needs time in my honest opinion. Plus it's UNDERVALUED. Legit People have been picking up this stock up in crazy volume since it dropped. down to new low. Its like drop $200 and forget about it type of move.
More lockdowns will be announced soon, and spy feels like it will crash any minute so guess Monday will open green

Even if there is war, there's no way pltr is going to get any piece of that.
Lmao Roth IRA what retarded shit is this.
wasn't DIX at over 46% yesterday? and now it says it was at 43.9%. Did it retroactively change?
I've taken to working at night, trading during the day...it's driving my wife nuts

Not too late to buy puts for when they go down 10% a day next week
Intresting. Why would they spread out after I goes down if they were deep itm? Wouldn't that mean they were more likely to pass?
Everyone follows those now so they don’t mean that much anymore
FCEL up 1 cent AH. Here comes the 💰
No lower than 17.50 buts it will trade sideways like old people fuck slowly.
Noisy ass family
You have it backwards.  If you SELL Calls someone has the right to buy your shares at that strike price.

If you SELL Puts that give someone else the right to sell their shares to you at that price.

This is why covered calls have very little risk because you own the shares and all that happens is you lose the upside.  Only risk is the stock goes down in value while you hold it.

Go back and look at your transaction.
Screw you old man
This is the way.
Even if it goes up I still make money. I just have collateral
Most people would have sold for gains when it was a penny stock. There’s no shame in that. It’s now a legit player in the China EV movement. As long as production numbers keep going up, so will their share prices.

$SUMO finally broke out of its down channel... with people starving for growth, earnings on dec 3, and a relatively fair valuation (5x revs) its hard to see this one staying st $20 for much longer. Get in while you can!
I’m curious too. What’s it take to not be poor for a living?
you have more money to lose, retard
When I saw we could do the repid test here in minnesota and I had a co-worker test positive I had to go get a test. Ours are moving faily quickly depending on the times you choose but I have seen 2 hour waits already and our city isn't much larger then 80k people MAYBE MAX.

ALSO  everything about the vault health test system is just sprung up and I think all privately held. Whoever landed those contracts are making a fucking MINT.
yes
Mamo wey
i have tsla calls so it’ll probably gap down until they’re worth a dollar and then jump to 2000 as soon as they expire.
Fuck yea

This is hell staring at my losses fuck you COTY
Maybe consult a tax professional, you can't contribute $60k to a Roth IRA in a single year...but what do I know - tax professional
You sell covered calls or puts on your shares
I saw Pltr at 19.50 and I decided to do what I don’t do, get off wsb and the internet for 4 hours. I was fantasizing about how much I’d make since I threw a sizable amount in. By the time I came back, my calls were -50%.
Because it a) wasn’t used b) the law - I read the text, he is doing what congress wanted him to do..

You can get close fill on something collecting 90% of the width as collateral on something with high iv and a tight spread and close it after a good delta move in your favor but you have to have at least a month to expiration and watch the dividend schedule. The major disadvantage besides the ones mentioned is liquidity as deep itm options aren’t as liquid

sometimes you need to reposition vs average down.  I.e. blown up baba 300c could have been cut and replaced with 2x 280c or similar.

Bless your heart retard. He said he sold the puts.. which means someone has the option to buy his 100 shares at strike price of $18.50. I just got assigned some RIOT puts at $4 so now I'll have to buy back at around $5ish  but I locked in profit because I bought at $3. Comprende

Wanna share a sad tale of how bad my luck is. My broker which has been good and usually only has service interruptions for the first few min of the day f’d me really hard today. I got 0tde pton calls for .40. I put sell order and kept bumping it up cause it was flying up mid day. I pushed it up to 2.65.  Then the broker app went down for 2 hours. This was the first time it’s ever happened and also the first time I had a 6bagger. Their phonecall centre wasnt working either. The call high for the day was 2.48 so my sell order didn’t go theu. By the time the app worked again the calls dropped to .6.   Set you limits within reason and don’t get greedy folks.

The thing with the stock market is that share prices are based on assumptions about the future and that pricing is often very far down the line. Jumia is being priced for what they could be in the future. The arguments against jumia being 'african amazon' here are reasonable enough but there's a very real possibility that certain African countries (keep in mind that Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt are fairly large economies right now, roughly equivalent to European nations like Austria) will rapidly advance in the next decade and if jumia is a market leader at that point they'll be a making bank.

Buy shares of potential meme stocks before they moon.  Wait for the run up.  Sell covered calls while WSB is circle jerking over it to profit from volatility
It's the opposite of buying a call. So you sell 11/27 22C and you get the credit amount. If it never passes 22, you keep your stock and the credit for selling. If it passes 22, you have to sell your 100 stocks at 22, essentially still keeping the gains from 18 to 22, but nothing past that.

Stop being a pussy
Looks very likely that Wall Street is going to gin up a "crisis" until some sort of stimulus / Fed backstop is signed into law. I have no doubt that they'll drop SPX to 3200 if necessary to get what they want - MOAR FREE TENDIES.  


As the virus gets worse and analysts begin downgrading GDP numbers (JPM gave a shot across the bow today) and earnings estimates, we'll have our catalyst.  


Pay very close attention to the US Dollar, it will be the tell as well as the spark that ignites the tantrum.

When people say the stock market is forward looking, they really mean it. If you wait for unemployment to return to 3.5% before you buy stock, you waited waaaay too long.

Especially when interest rates are so low that bonds earn you nothing. You basically don’t have a choice but to buy stock if you’re a money manager.
You absolutely should

I thought I was fucked coming into today tbh. But yeah, SE is nuts. I've been playing the volatility the last month. Wish I had grabbed more shares when it dipped to the 160s.

That's their fault for building such shitty planes. 

Also I'm guessing COVID-19 is probably their fault too.
Theta will usually make consistent gains as long as your right most of the time. In my experience if one out of 5 plays goes wrong you lose. Credits and diagonals are my thing. Nothing like gaining like 5% a month on your capital
Wow he sounds like a dick
> Also what club were you going to where Peloton was cheaper than the membership

i see you haven't been to lifetime. cheapest i've seen starts at $79 for their low end club. 1-state only. For their diamond club, you're looking at around $160.
They’ll be ITM next week
TSLA 11/27 630c
Got blown up in june and have been slowly trading spreads since like a bitch. Like a recovering alcoholic in a gin bar I couldn’t help it and took out a margin loan to buy 1000 PLTR Monday. It worked. But I feel like water is about to find it’s level and I’m fucked
was gonna yolo into it a couple days ago knowing itll be back fast, was a pu$$y
It should go buck up to 19 by mid next week, don’t worry too much.
Gawd what stupidity. The perfect and obvious choice is right in the name.

Have u been making bank? With covered cald
limit gains son. I sell CCs
thinking 550 makes sense for next week
U forgot blnk. Up 124%
these institutions are playing against other institutions. 

im bullish because even in the worse drops in the last few years. you only had a draw down of 1-3 months. I can sit for 1-3 months holding.

if you cant do that then this business isn't for you
Haha true
🧲+❤️=💰
WSB is your only reason
Well, I did double my money with the 0day 36.5's. Bought a handful for 20 a contract and sold at open for 50
This is so dangerous I love it
And we killed him...
Now that OPEX is out of the way, next week we'll know the true trend we're taking,, after the last two OPEX's we continued to tank (Sep, Oct) but the one before, we mooned (Aug). fuck the algos

AH action means nothing for PLTR. Float is ginormous and action is insane. We drilled AH yesterday as well.
Why do DDs when you can just *feel* the market
no. vaccine is now priced in.
the yolo giveth, the yolo taketh away

she'll never see this but I'm sorry babe... I had to go to the moon.    
I'm sorry I was so autistically fixated on stonks that I didn't follow through with more important commitments in life.     
portfolio up over 100% since breakup last month btw.    
positions: everything electric vehicle related   
may buy some $MTCH soon as well.
Hell, I think I'm a hot shit genius when my options go green before turning red.
Alright pala-bulls, get ready to buy the dip when palantir hits 17 on monday. It wont stay there long
like 90% of their revenue is thru car sales
Gotta keep the poors informed
Soros is offloading shares. I think there’s a few more red days. I’m gonna be a buyer mid next week.
Because bears live here on weekends while bulls go have fun with their gains
Then look at DNK. Best short term gains because it’s considered undervalued tech. It’s a SPOC like palantir but it has a huge user base
PSTG for earnings next week. 1/15/21 20calls
at the TOP not after the drop LMFAO,  
timing was about 1 h before market closed but sure,  
its only slightly leveraged and not options yet so ;) nop see you at the bottom fam
CCP gonna fuck u again 🇨🇳
Yeah, you’re a clown I hit 100% profit with 90c 11/27, even more because I’ve been swing trading it this past month.

What’s a play I can do with $80 fellas
Dude it went below 18 twice today. anyway no worries now we're all strapped in for the ride
The plan is to use our chinese ev gains to buy teslas
I am confuse
Love it!
So now I can pick up worthless OTM contracts on the cheap and pray for... something... to move the price... then sell within my 1 hour to expiration timeframe? LETS GOOOOO!
I need short term like next week
What wars did Obama start?
Yeah I did some credit spreads for earnings that worked out. Also tried to buy some dips but we all know how that is going lol. I finished flat this week but it was a fucking battle to get there. Next week here we come!

Got'em.

Oh wait it's me.

Yeah dumbass
Pretty red day smh, great week tho tbh ngl.  TSLA gang BABA gang PLTR gang like Little Pimp, joined SQ gang at close

You trade differently when money is on the line. Hell I play poker differently when there’s money involved
nah not really

Especially if the overvalued market unwinds even a little
Bought sept $40 calls. Holding over 200% past few weeks
Shut up and drink the coffee I bought you.
Holding KNDI over the weekend, Hope that pays off, just let the uptrend keep going after this pullback into Thanksgiving
How far out did you buy?
Unless you’re experienced and know how to interpret real TA like vix term structure, it’s best to sit out for opex week
What is a reasonable price target for CRSR next week? I just want honest answers boyz
bro no joke this is an amazing strat lol. Might buy in before new year
Well the current one isn't going to the moon ever lol, thing is yuuuge. A fancy space version I'm sure they'd find a way to monetize bigly. This is obviously extreme speculation. Even if there is no space involved, printing will be the future one day, just a matter of when. I think it'll be as big as the personal computer boom, every household has a 3D printer and instead of buying a trashcan or toothbrush from amazon you just purchase the schematic and it prints it for you right there. Again, long way off, but this is the future, we just might not live long enough to see it.
u/savevideo
at least VALE is up 20% in the past month

I like to imagine that they've pulled so many trailers in their life that it's just muscle memory.
Fuckin commie
Please tell him to go to college. Very few people have the discipline to self teach and it's literally a free ride. There are so many software jobs, the 5 big tech companies you're thinking of are not the only places to work.

The only self taught engineer that I know of where I work took waaay longer to get to Engineer 2, and 3. College was actually enjoyable as long as you don't have a bad mindset about it, saying "ughhh I could learn this all on my own" is a shit ass excuse to be lazy that I heard from plently of dropouts working at Walmart now.
Solution: sell calls, never puts. No chance of being utterly fucked.
Folks saw it break 19 and probably FOMOd. The play was leaps. Weeks ago.
GMHI still going in AH over deal with intel mobileye. Got 300 shares for selling  premarket monday
No, at this rate, PLTR may drop below 18 AH. I am getting nervous
Because
Do buttholes smell better? Ah I see what you're doing there.
In
Why does it matter when fractional exist now.. oh options
Nah this mentality is bad honestly. 

Once you've secured gains, those are your gains. The risk is no longer a net loss on the trade, but a trim of your gains even if unrealized. 

I eye up a calendar spread any time a leap goes +50%

Also not to mention...the EV bubble will 1000% burst at some point. NIO might be fine but will still take a huge haircut.
What do you sell for millions of dollars a year on eBay? Never heard of such a thing. Not saying you're lying.
You're in the wrong part of town bud
TSLA calls. Any strike
You should learn about naked puts and margin. Theta gang is a hell of a lot more successful than YOLOing on a 5% success play. People drastically outperforming the market with an 85% success rate on every play

Fuck it I’m buying SNPR and deleting my app
Where do you find such info??
Of course PUMP is a top 5 ticker with 95%+ bullish sentiment in WSB

Lmao
Telsa is in the tech bubble and is the center of it . I'm glad you think Tech has more room to run but I'm holding year puts and I'm still  playing calls on tech. It is more of a hedge while i make money on this tech bubble. Tesla makes most of its money thru car sales and they still heavily rely on others for their batteries.
My 9 year old begs me constantly for robux. I will buy shares and then feed him robux. Solid investment strategy.

Did you happen to buy my 11/27 270$calls I sold at open for a 30% gain? Nice.
Agree. You got to play both: Calendar Debit Spreads have always worked out well for me.
Guys why the fuck is PLTR dropping after I bought this morning

Seeeeeking alphaaaaa “why I own Palantir and you should too” 

Lol
Depends on the situation. If their are cars/curbs then yes and can make it easier
Just sell contracts and wait. That’s what I did and it was wild. Was actually looking forward to getting assigned this week. There’s always next week.
Theta gang. Can’t live with them, can’t make 500% gains on a YOLO FD without them
Let’s pump and dump Sears after owning it
I was too broke for TSLA calls so i sat out this week. Whats the move next week guys?
Lots of talk on the inter web about Gluu...it that the next meme stock?
Grabbed 6 356$ calls at close that cost about a grand. Felt gambly. Still somehow managed down 11% in like the last minute before close lol
You're not wrong, but they go for the higher percentage plays. If you have a lot of capital it can work.
I'm bullish on PYPL and have 100 shares, but $300 by March is very ambitious.

Dummy should take the free ride.  Any monkey can learn to code that's the easy part of being a good software engineer.  Go to school because you don't want to be a code monkey nor the zookeeper in charge of the monkeys, the goal is being the guy running the zoo.

Wait, you were hyping PLTR a month ago? Why against it now? Paper hand at $11 and FOMO at $19.66 😂
Where the BABA bois at
I’m already bored. Open the fucking markets.
Where did I say you should buy it?  Observation buddy
Not the way lol
Would be kinda cool. Losing only $12 is like winning to me.
Even though Black Friday is cancelled hasn't there been YoY increase in online sales the week of and weekend after Thanksgiving for awhile now? Won't there be even more this year? Has the market priced this in already and will it reflect the week after or will we see the pump this coming week and hard dip the week after to set up buying before Christmas starts?
If the shares are free you should buy more than just a few hundred 😂

You could have billions worth of equity and for some reason even in your wildest dreams you only net like 20k
SE and BABA calls made it a good day. Got some MP and PCG for next week.
Happy birthday you poor bastard
Easily
nah lots of big money call activity 545 and 550 11/27
the nature of the yolo I suppose
To me results are the only thing that matters. Unrealized gains are pretty much just flashing pixels on a screen. Once you pull it and then transition to a low risk or high probability of success strategy then you're my hero. As a casino once said to a million dollar winner " I'm not concerned that he won that much, Im just concerned he won't come back".
That's a good thing tho

Just keep a small yolo portfolio and the rest in your margin accounts where you do less retarded shit

Hopefully lol
Yeah I thought this was the norm tbh
wsb front page starting to get a lot of gain posts, means we're gonna pull back soon
Lol the whole market is already running on vaccine fumes wtf is more news gonna do
Bears look at their portfolios at the end of the week and be like

"And **we'll never be ROYALSS (Royalls)** It don't run in our blood! that kind of luck just aint for us, we crave a different kind of buzz"
No I really don’t. Majority of my trades have not worked out this year honestly. Was hoping this one would be different.
Word.  Too bad I had a call in that expired today 😭
Matt Ryan is like NKLA. Out of no where it'll surprise tf' out of everyone. Good luck\~
those are just mark prices (average of bid and ask)

Doesn't mean a retard bought it lol.
Here are my self-educated explanations, you can find better ones via google:

Dividend risk:
Say your spread includes a short call. Right before dividend is released, you get assigned that call and are short 100 shares overnight. You should have a long leg that can be exercised to cover that, but you’re also gonna be paying the dividend on those short shares (and you not be getting it back on the shares you get from your long leg because that will be exercised after the dividend is released).

Pin risk: Your option is right at the money at expiration, and your broker chooses to exercise it. Stock moves in the wrong direction over the weekend before you can sell/cover the shares you’re holding.
Such a hard week. Market stays flat but has insane swings up and down. Theta fucks bears, bulls, and even hard to play for theta gang because of all the headfakes making it seem like we were gonna moon/drill hard.
HOWARD STERNS PENIS
Right, or the daily chart is a bull flag and we will bounce off 353 back to to retest ath, if we break below 350 ish then yeah continue slow down trend. But you would need a “strong reason” to get back to 330s too, that’s too low without having some catalyst beyond everything that is currently priced in
I'm so in for this
9000 —> 2,250 —> almost 17,000
Everyone here seems to bearish.
fomo’d into tsla eod. did i fomo into the wrong thing
Getting burned by the fucky market, I have learned to buy to close sold puts regardless of how "safe" it seems. I already got the bulk of the money! Just free it up and make the next trade instead of waiting for the $100-300 dollars left over.
if u think monday red ur straight up retarded sorry no other way to say it
rip

I think it’s possible, but it’d be a longer term thing
Lol at comparing a cryptocurrency to a car company
Hellllll yeah
You got a great chance

Yup. I studied mech engineering but have been a professional software dev for 2.5 years now. Transitioned careers after locking myself in a room and studying for a year straight. A high-ranked bootcamp is much  better than what I did. I have a very strong drive and would not recommend people do this. I hit a REALLY low point in morale.


A STEM college degree goes a longgg way. Perceived or not, it really shows the world aren't a retard and are capable of learning. Unless he's Zuckerberg or Bill Gates level of competency, he should go through college.


Tech is not a meme. It's here to stay and rapidly growing. The entry barrier is getting easier but tech companies in CA, NY, WA, etc only want the best of the best. It's tough in these markets but pay is extraordinary. I'm sure midwest jobs are much easier to land.
1M / 100M = 1%

That's not a bad idea, I might try that
Lol true. I'm also just a retard
I did a shit ton of math homework on the options chain yesterday and today, and I can tell you January is your sweet spot.  You can go higher up the chain and for more premium, then the benefit starts to tail off in February.  If it goes down, you'll wish you'd locked in a lot of (worthless) premium when you could. If it goes up, you'll wish you'da gone with a higher strike for more money.  Staying flat next week is the only way you win the weeklies. Does that sound like something PLTR would do? Stay flat for 5 days?

Are you comparing coins to the EV industry? China EV is a no brainer right now man. They are at risk of facing a serious oil crisis if they don’t go EV in 10 years. Laws are in place where 20% of all vehicles sold have to be EV by 2025. The EV movement in China is mandatory, its not a hunch. This is common sense investing.

Ok goodluck with that. Please post your results of trying to trade off that. I know many experienced people who have tried and failed because its not possible to know whats going to happen based off of just those metrics.
The BABA chart today was excellent and I'm a guy that thinks most TA is garbage and usually trades on narrative.  It was trading far below WVAP at open with a clear support and increasing volume.  Feels good to make a nice play.

Glitch
Tsla 400p dec 31 will get you $1100. Nothing crazy. But 2% a month ain't nothin to shake a stick at either
normally I’d agree, but vaccine news and stim talks are always right around the corner.  seems like no one wants to dump positions and risk missing the rip up.
Yes seems like a glitch

yeah well even so that means spacex will only buy one of their products. Why would anybody need more than one? especially on a rocket where they have limited room for storage.
 looks pretty cool. Wish Tesla would make one with scissor doors. Would be interesting to consider if they ever got them in the US
I have a feeling they're gonna peak in January.
What do my fellow retards think is gonna happen with Tesla next week? I got 11/27 520 calls
It is?
you're selling them against your LEAPS. It's a poor man's covered call. It will help reduce your cost basis.

My dumb ass was wasted last night and threw $1,000 down for the Falcons to beat the Saints on Sunday.  I didn’t even take the points.  Money line.

Idc that Drew Breese is injured and they are starting a 3rd string qb - the falcons suck.

Please someone tell me wtf I was thinking.

How fucked am I?
no guys, BABA jumped $5 in 5 seconds, not a glitch. god damn you're fucking retarded
I don’t have that kind of cheddar, and that’s not the point of a YOLO.
I think you're fucked man.  You're gonna need like 2.5 points before EOD Wednesday o make it profitable.  Just hope for a vaccine bump on Monday.
I sell QQQ and mega tech puts about 30 days out. If some get assigned I'll sell covered calls or just stay long.
Green Monday, confirmed
Baba glitch right?
Good shit I like that enthusiasm
BABABOOEY
I'd rather lose some money on not pulling out rather than having 5 kids lol

Learned a new thing this week. Trust your DD. Follow through with the plan
It would seem that I'm ban proof.....? Haha jk.... unless...
Their only risk is if it drops back to $4. The issue is that there’s been so much hype around it now that if it were drop anywhere close to that amount (assuming they weren’t proven to be fraudulent) then people would see it as being extremely discounted and would buy in. If I had NEO leaps I wouldn’t even sweat the down days because I’d know that by the time they expire they’re be worth even more
That'll come when my congestion makes its phlegmy way to my lungs
Bought TSLA at $362 and sold at $430. Crying inside
I'm one and I know several  self-taught engineers. It's one of the few careers that don't require a 4yr degree but is very rewarding, pays very well, and has an almost endless upside. a CS degree will put you ahead of self-taught folks that have just started in the industry, but 5-10 years in, you wouldn't know who has a cs degree vs not and most companies won't hold it against you if you're smart and work well within teams
Oh I’m bullish on pltr long term no doubt. Pretty sure Bido  already acknowledged their value to Big Brother. Just waiting for pltr to rape Syria

I think $ALGM, might be the next $CRSR...
#1, pick a stock that will go up.

#2, don't pick a stock that will go down.

#3 Get one with higher than usual IV, maybe even something around earnings or an event that will crush IV in your favor.

#4 if you have a website or broker that has a scan you can pop in all these variables and find one with a good return on capital

30-45 DTE, IV > 60%, Delta between -0.20 and -0.30 are good things to scan for.

Friday is gonna sell off every week now.  Nobody wants to hold over the weekend and risk a huge gap down on Monday from bat aids news
10-1 or 1-10?
you should make a high level post with proof.  This counts as a loss IMO.
Worst thing is, i knew Shitcoin was going to take off around 12k, knew i coulda made a solid 30%+ gain on that ( 60%+ in retrospect), but no.. i figured anything below 3x is too low.. now my account is on its last legs. F.m.l
RMG starting to gain traction it looks like. Volume way up this week. Romeo deal supposed to close before year end. I’m gonna throw in a few bucks Monday in case they get included in the EV hysteria.

BABA spike?
Thanks to the idiot who said buy coty calls. Made 800% on all 10 of them.
If it breaks 450 Monday it’s going back to the 470-490
They'll be competing with 500$-1k motorbikes. In Asia, people ride their motorbikes foreeeever and then they get them repaired for like 25$. I think its a hard sell, might do better in Europe though. If they can get a big corporate deal though, that might legitimize them. But they'll also be competing with Ayro on those.
Fucking weekend so boring...
Now do Tom waits!
Just say “I have calls” next time and use a sad emoji
Update, I’m not retiring from trading because I lost money, I’m retiring because I don’t want to lose my gains. Going to live it up over the holidays and come back in January
🤡
I’m not self taught and have transitioned away from software engineering to data science but it’s becoming more accepted to be self taught IF you have demonstrable projects that show you’ve not just followed tutorials online and done nothing else. Software Engineering =/= Computer Science but you can become a software engineer without doing a computer science degree. 

I would 100% recommend right now anyway, to get at least a bachelors in software engineering but preferably comp sci just to be sure you’re going to get a job. If your cousin is however a very motivated and hard working individual who will work hard to not learn poor programming practices that comes with being self taught then it’s very possible he’ll fare just as well as comp sci graduates. I definitely did not have that kind of motivation back when I was starting Uni
All you gay bears better sleep with a plug in this weekend. About to get pounded by the joy of turkey eating bulls next week
Jesus man I would kill for 400% right about now
self-taught, no college degree whatsoever, six figure salary. tons of free/cheap courses to take online, especially these days. you have to be very self-motivated to make it work though, most people aren’t
After a 100 percent increase too lol. Tards everywhere.
To be quite honest, I was looking for a way out of the hole after JKS jumped off a cliff and I managed to scrape out a viable working pool after hitting a 5-bagger on FSLR earnings! We all have regrets. I wouldn't consider this extensive enough to be DD, but I think that if you're in it for the long game, NIO/XPEV/LI are very promising. I understand this is WSB though. 

&#x200B;

[Apparently there's an investor lock-up on NKLA that lifts on Dec. 3](https://investorplace.com/2020/11/nkla-stock-nikola-looks-like-a-good-longer-term-bet/). I'll keep my eye on it from now until that date and see what happens. The EV hype is in full swing right now, but I don't think that there's a strong enough hydrogen infrastructure for a company like NKLA to truly take off yet. Companies like PLUG & FCEL have seen some nice gains over the past few weeks, but they're pretty tame compared to NIO/XPEV (or even FUV/SOLO, if we want to go there).   


If you wanna get into it more, feel free to shoot me a DM some time.
You are at a disadvantage if you don't have a degree. Just get the fucking thing, regardless if you go to classes or not.
Not worth my time dude. Go suck musks autistic cock
IMO maybe to at least 15, If I see it surpass that I’m pulling out bc it would send to good to be trye
Best of luck to you too!
Also shhh it’s a secret
I'm cool with that.
How the fuck did you do this?

No, we can’t. That’s the problem.

No, we have plenty of ways to train neural nets without patterns or similar. Read up on “Self-supervised learning” and “unsupervised learning”

I’m pretty confident that we could develop something that pretty closely resembles general artificial intelligence, if we weren’t restricted by Computational power like we are now.
Nah. Cash gang are cucks because they're standing in the corner not participating while watching everyone fuck (and be fucked by) the market

Lol, no.  I've seen this exact thing before.  Some people are trying to compare this to 2008, but it's nothing like that.  It's EXACTLY like the 2000 dot-com bubble.  You can tell when you're near the top when you start seeing people invest who never do so in normal times.  I've actually been enjoying it because of the nostalgia it's giving me.

I was up over 400% at one point today off of SOLO calls I bought at close yesterday. 

And then I overtraded my way to a -30% dayall in the last hour and a half of the trading day.
JPow shoulda just given all the money to everyone & let the consumers decide liquidity. That would be around $21,000 to every man, woman, child in Merica. If they wanna buy a MacBook, great.

Lol this retard making a big deal of a 5% drop.Thats completly fucking normal.
Probably, yes. Although can also just go sideways
FUBO is a fucking beast.  Gonna be 35 a share before February.
so lets say you started with 10k, you were down to $2,500 after march (-75%)

Then you up 71% over the past 6 months, and are now up to $4,275.

If you mean you were up 71% on your all-time, thats a big difference than being up 71% in the 6 months post -75%, and should be expressed differently because congrats thats outstanding.
Up 5k

So if I am a retail investor and own GME shares with Etrade then can Etrade close out the position without my consent?  Or did you mean close position for those shorting only?  I ask because an earlier response above said put a limit sell to $1000.  TIA
I don't think it was short. It looks like profit taking tbh
Yeah but those are real companies that can shoot up while NKLA is a steaming pile of garbage so I don't mind shorting it
Oh that shit is going to squeeze. No doubt about it
Pltr going up or down next week
Imagine thinking companies aren't always in some sort of debt. They're not going to expand without taking loans and investments retard.
Imagine being stupid enough to think this.
Look at the order flows and then check DIX. DIX indicates how much was bought vs sold, and if there were large order flows and DIX looks bullish then it’s likely there were lots of purchases
Which one?

1. Near-zero interest rates since the financial crisis
2. Massive consolidation in the technology sector. Technology is no longer just about the hardware/software, but about creating an ecosystem and squeezing dollars out of every teet these companies can get their hands on. They make money from customers, content creators, etc. They are expanding not only vertically but also horizontally, into other industries and eating those peoples' lunches. Would you really be surprised in 10 years if I told you that you'd be buying your auto insurance from Amazon? 20 years ago they sold books and mp3 files. They now do that along with just about every retail item you can think of plus groceries, video streaming, home devices, video game streaming and a bunch of other shit. They're making a move into prescription drugs and I'd be surprised if they didn't try to make a move into finance and banking.

I don't understand why people keep calling it a government contractor. They have done business with public companies too.
Selling leaps? You’re gonna fucking die.
This works beautifully.  Its not as great now, but I was selling 12Ps for april at 450 per contract.  Breakeven stock price is $7.5.  If they are at 7.5 after Q4 ER in march, the world has ended
I dunno I hope 280 at open. I really misplayed today. Was bagholding 10 x270 calls 94% down, added 20 more at 0.25 hoping to lose more or win big but some how broke even. I suck.
He is the messiah!
I hope i will have some good story to share on TURKEY WEEK
Realize that eBay has stopped using PayPal as their payment provider and now does it internally.

Technically this is a infinite gain
We could throw together a computer that is physically capable of it, or can match it in terms of neurons but how would you program it to think? How would you have it do things that the human brain can do that we don’t even know? Just having the components to match the brain 1 for 1 doesn’t mean it will have the ability to think like a brain, even given the current ability to “learn” it still requires complex algorithms and being fed data based off patterns, but that does not necessarily mean it can achieve some kind of sentient or conscious super intelligent state.

CERB lasted 6 months (March-Sept). Now replaced with CRB which is $900 biweekly. This is also 6 months IIRC.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
That’d still be it’s high sooo unless you see other numbers like the $100 in your head we live in reality... it’ll cool off and pump more I’m not doubting but I won’t enter up here. Probs $14 and below if it ever sees it again

They do but they are positioned in a good niche situation:

The business sector will go wild for these as delivery solutions

The leisure and country sector that normally purchases mopeds

Europeans and Asians

There is no other competitor right now and it looks like they may be able to secure a contract with DHL and potentially Dominos. Deliveries start before most other EV manufacturers. In my opinion it is more of a business than most other EV plays.

Potential for growth is huge. They're expanding into the commercial sector. Any big enterprise with loads of data stand to benefit from their product line. Application range is also huge.
Disagree.  April calls are win.  Should still get shares, but april calls are pretty safe.
Slow downtrend from ath is pretty clear. Without some strong reason to go up SPY will melt back to $330s over the next couple weeks
If there's a spike you can try to unload it early, but there needs to be a more overzealous person out there.  Shouldn't be hard to find here.  Gotta be careful with the shorter contracts, like weeklies.  You're going to end up donating to thetagang

It’s not that he doesn’t know anything about technical stuff. It’s the fact that he THINKS he knows everything and is super ignorant towards Elon. Nobody is laughing at someone because they can’t participate in an expert talk about Artificial intelligence and rocket science with someone who owns companies who develop self driving cars and rockets.
my bagheld $365 1/15c's would love a gap up to $300, not going to happen, but it seems like we've seen the bottom for BABA and it's the holiday season so I feel like the only direction is up.
Can you give me an example of what you are trying to do?

OP has it right!  Well, except fair value for share price, $25 is low by any measure, but I digress.

Shorts should exit, small possible upside, massive downside.  Depending on what happens, you could be looking at losing over 100 per share short in the event of a squeeze.  It may not squeeze, but its not worth losing your account for the potential of a few pennies.  Get puts if you want to lose money betting against it.

&#x200B;

For those just joining the GME trend, be careful buying short dated calls.  Personally I'm only adding december and april right now.  Short dated may do well, but understand that we coudl get a pullback at any point and kill your kills.  Too many people from WSB have lost everything doing that with GME, when it is so easy to make money on.
All my puts are in the $360s. They're ripening like delicious fruit.
thank you
Box spreads are different but it’s a similar issue; if they let you do this you could open an infinite number of positions with $0, theoretically, and since there are (typically improbable & preventable) risks beyond the theoretical max loss of the spread (dividend risk, pin risk), and you have no skin in the game, RH would be taking on that risk entirely themselves. Basically this is what happened with 1ronyman (the box spread guy); he opened a shit ton of box spreads for profit despite having almost nothing in his account, then got assigned on some of the short legs and got fucked, and RH basically had to pay for those losses.

If it makes you feel better, placing spread orders that are arbitrages will never fill even if the inefficiency is real; you have to leg into them to get those profits. Which you can do on RH.

I dunno, I'm just waiting for it to get back around split prices so I can dump it. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Did some news come up? Or is Monday just gonna be green bc it’s Monday?
Look into sector rotations/sector strength and see which ones are about to start underperforming. Buy stocks in those companies, sell weekly CCs, then transition when things start rotating again. 

Or better yet, start using those premiums to buy into underperforming sectors, so when they start to rise you make money and then can sell CCs when it starts to rotate out.

No it does not. It might need breakthroughs to do it efficiently on technology we now have, but we could also *theoretically* program a complete artificial brain, with the same number of neurons and capabilities a human brain has.

I work in tech.  I can tell you everybody and their grandmother here is involved in some way with "AI" and have some basic understanding of it.  What most layman don't understand is most R&D is concentrated on finding ways for machines to do pattern-matching as well as a human.  The actual decision making (what people think of as AI) is still mostly a bunch of if-elses written by programmers.

There was a spurt a few decades ago where they made some progress and thought we will have real AI but then hit a wall and we experienced an "AI Winter".  Recent advancements in semiconductors especially in memory density has unlocked the development in "deep learning", which is just a fancy way of saying we use a lot of memory to recognize patterns.  It led to a breakthrough in pattern recognition and produced things that seemed "close enough" to many, but I think we will eventually hit a another wall somewhere down the line after we pluck all the low-hanging fruit produced by chucking memory at the problem.

Look at all the American SPOCs even when they are equivalent BS they are being sold at crazy multiples in comparison to their Chinese counterparts.

Not 90% of all countries. 90% of all market. The biggest market/purchaser being China, EU, and the US. China and EU is already have that commitment to ban in the next 10-20 years. Norway I think is already at like 60% (?) adoption. Most of Chinese public transportation and taxis are EV and they are pushing for 25% by 2025 and all by 2035 (?). A simple google will give you the facts. 

You are right though, it’ll be tough for countries to simply let the invisible hand dictate the demand. That’ll take too long, which is why I keep saying there is no EV market in the US. For countries to accelerate this, there has to be government intervention - like “communist” and “socialist” countries like China, Norway, and others.

I'm getting a margarine call soon. Should I tell them I only like butter?
11/27 55c
Thanks! You too!
Puts mean you would be buying shares at that price. Great way to make money and buy at the price you want.

Calls would be you selling that that price.
Most of it is bot manipulated tbh. 10000 upvotes is nothing for people to manipulate especially if you can brainwash people and gain votes
this dude is another level of retarded, OP blesses us with current holdings portfolio of a god mommy minus delta that's a big warren buffet boomer fail pick and this guy is like what's a good stock??
5k into 12/4 370c at close. It's been nice knowing all of you.
I think that’s what I’ll do - I’m breaking solidarity by selling my shares but I wouldn’t mind getting assigned on the cheap on shares that I don’t mind owning
Ban
J-POW just said he’s returning the money... it will not be green...
I’m honored to have a comment from you.
Do you understand what bubbles are? The reality is buying into tesla rn is 100% fomo and expecting the next person to pay more for an already expensive asset.

Interesting.  Wonder what would compel the institutions to terminate their loans and get the shares back. They're probably making a killing off of the borrow fees. I'm short sighted on the issue, and dont really understand how it works and the logic behind it though.
I just bought 100 shares off this comment you better be right man or I swear to fuck
So bullish?
Those dkngs will drill lmao
December seemed like a crapshoot but not a bad bet, January sounds like a lock to me

Hoping we get some tendies on Monday

Edit: closed that's shit for an L 🤦‍♂️
200 contracts, $5,000 worth.
I read “hungry” instead of “angry” and did a double take
Don’t think you understood me. It does cost them money. 85% people lose
Got 358 so close enough
Foh with that light mode shit
Yo. What did you get from McD’s?
Oh shit the J-Pow just said “fine fuck it I’ll give it back”
Are you sort of betting this is the top then?
I know future people when I see future people. So Robinhood also believes in the Bill and Ted future. Excellent!
I loaded down at close. Way more than I comfortable with.
They're all running up their credit cards that they recently paid off by not going out to dinner every night.
Monday "stocks rebound as investors shake off coronavirus concerns."
I love Fridays.

Now I don't have to scroll through all those $0 contracts in my list.

As opposed to r/conservative???
Its more than that GUH ...you .just dont get it
How it work when you buy a call that’s lower than the current share price ?

No I started buying stock in 2018 but only stared in options last year. My initial investment was 2k but total out of pocket was between 17-19k. I think it looks like 1k because I withdrew 18k recently
With uK gov yes
Will be taking position Monday
Partially. I drive a Tesla to school, guess what Autopilot is. An AI.
Because?
Wish I would’ve gone with January but I decided to do December. Hopefully I get some tendies.
Salute!
I thought that was box spreads? Isn't that something different.
Someone ban this mofo

Can u update before 6 so I can go all in lol
Opex day
I have a few 9c ans 10c 12/18. Hope they play out
 Maybe I should buy shares and just yolo the whole portfolio. I like their small EV compared to the solo tricycle thing.
No
Yeah that car in the pic is the p7, it cost 30k usd new. Pretty sick IMO

Very very green monday
Well, if you're in at 7, try to sell for 4 at market open, it'll probably be 3 within a minute

Less than 50% loss, not bad imho
My mans has TSLA 800c 🥵
No doubt it will be over 100 within 2 years.
I think we'll be there next week.
Pushing for before end of year.
What tickers I want to look them up
It's grand central station. The year is 2047. All trading is now  holograms. Women adorn themselves in the clothing of a meth addicted princess and men, a suspiciously mint green dildo.
I'm 92% confident it will be a 50/50 chance
I’m up 800. Still got 4 months till expiration.
Why the fuck is NKLA in a spreadsheet with calls?
Im not in colorado and i still had to google those titties one time
tbh I feel sorry for these guys. It's such a meaningless little cry of anguish.

I wouldn't want their emotions
Fake and gay
It's weird you would know your assignment now. Usually I don't get shares until Saturday and yours is so close you may not get all the assigned shares. Yea I know 1 cent is nothing but if it's like a MM say they have a ton of those. They can get that 1 cent and lock it in on the dark pools for 2.50. (So they make the 2.50 - 2.49, of course they lose the premium they paid up front for the puts but at least they salvaged 1 cent back and all those add up).
Bro who give a shit about downvotes? Lol how do they affect you?
Do you know how stupid you sound
Lot easier just to say “all of it”
Spell check
Lmao this is how someone became 50k in debt on a 5k play.

What price you buy them at?
I loaded up on 11/27 AMD $84c and DKNG $48c. Lets see if they pay off
Im upvoteing because at least ill be involved in something that went up today
went to 2.47 or 2.48 after market.
Already up 40% on the warrants. Wouldn't be surprised to see them at $8 before the end of the year.
Dude they make 3 wheel cars. At least Ayro makes a compact trucks.

Do their cars really have scissor doors? That’s pretty sick
Good luck. I had 3 but i  🐔 out. Good luck! 

!Remindme 3days
What do you all think is the best CC strategy for actually *holding* stock -- say 3 stocks, 50k each, and selling CC's to earn an income. What would you suggest if that was the plan for the next 6 months?
Can’t believe how good 50% looks as a monthly gain. I was up 80% today and didn’t sell my calls. Ended -88%
Maybe.........🤪
Heavy downvoter day.
Happy trading friend
This looked a lot better at noon than it did at close.  Oof.
PLTR 21c January 15, bought them 2 days ago and up on them, should I buy more
I don’t know what that means.
Damn didn’t even think about this thanks
Went balls deep on next day expires on the cybertruck reveal that Thursday morning last year. I was not happy the next day.

Man I’m gonna need nvidia to announce they making spaceship to save my March calls 🤡🤡
I wouldn't, I'm selling CSPs on it. But if I get assigned I'm breaking the wheel and just holding. Covered calls limit your upside and there's too much upside for something that could theoretically happen any day now.
It’s real but I haven’t closed my positions yet so it could go away 😒
So profound.
That’s a picture from the annual Nio call-holders meeting
African American friday*
That's ok, as long as the other 70% is working for you.
Like up this thread, it depends on what you mean by “super intelligent” or general AI. Do you want it to “memorize” hundreds of languages and be able to talk? Perform complex math at will? Things like that are easy enough and will be done. Do you want it to question life or why it exists? To show some kinda of originality and degree of intelligence with a greater knowledge base than carrying out specific tasks like that of a human would require breakthroughs in various places, and no one knows how far off that will be

I don't think it's a bad strategy. I would still prefer to do it on QQQ mainly because my broker makes me pay 100% for TQQQ but only 25% (4:1 margin) on QQQ so I actually put up less for QQQ despite the higher price.

Ok , send it back when you’re done with it lol

Yeah, dude knows he's going to prison if hes not president anymore. He's going to pull every string in this coup attempt. This won't be over for a long time.
sure, a reversal to the downside
Well that applies to every businessman in China. He apparently beat them. I have seen some of his interviews from the early days where I found him very passionate to beat America from capturing Chinese market. Maybe that. And also maybe he is good at listening experts in his company if he personally is not good at certain topic. You don't become the richest person of such huge country merely by luck.
Someone who isn’t busy lambo shopping
True, thanks bro. I suppose I’m a little surprised they would scrape for that extra 0.01 lol
Cant argue with that.

Anybody watching this AH action on SPY? 2 million SPY market buy order just hit AH - that’s the second one in the last 15 min. 1.5 million market buy before that.
Yes I’ve seen the video. It is cultural differences because he was born and raised in a different era and system. I don’t know how to best explain it but I understand how looking at it you just think he’s a retard. He’s deficient in the technical developments of the world because his contributions to creating alibaba were never technical expertise but rather his vision for what it could do. He didn’t code or learn programming or whatever and I agree he’s ignorant of a lot of what Elon is saying but similarly Elon thinks too linearly from a technical perspective. Elon judges intelligence from how fast something (computer) can process an equation or whatever whereas Jacks success has always been in being able to convince people to join/help him realize his vision. Listen to the SoftBank guy talk about meeting Jack. He saw Jack didn’t have any incredible expertise but he was sold on his vision and presentation.



Tired of trying to explain it cus I admit it’s hard to explain. Elon’s great. Tesla will probably get to 1 trillion at some point. But retards here wana act like the CCP decided Jack was gonna be a tech billionaire and made him. No, he had to work his ass off and saw things differently than other people. He had help from the government but obviously you need that to succeed in China. Even Elon had to suck off the CCP to get them to help with Shanghai
Why not just go outside for a run?
I really don't get it.
That’s smart as fuck
All in on poots
Agreed. Babys tantrum will be burning the house down before being forced out

Amazon wasnt the leader of the bubble
It autocorrected to 2.5c, they were 2.5p’s. I guess I figured they wouldn’t scrape that 0.01 lol
Do you drive yourself to work?
Glad to be of assistance.
There are a lot of people who are not out of work, that now can not spend money in restaurants, bars, and cant go to the gym.

Is there anything less meaningful that Friday after market trades?
It's **OpEx** day.
You can sleep with my wife but leave my girlfriends alone
The worst thing that happens with this strategy is that the yield goes down. 

The only other thing is the fund gets liquidated, but you'd be fucked in that case anyway.
Amazon will run up next week into Black Friday and carry the other big tech names with it.
I finally tapped out on my little call position I had on it when it hit 13

Depends how far out the option is and whether you can actually catch the bottom on the average down.
No real buyers with that bid-ask spread anyways
Need better premiums. CCs are shit right now

You say you were assigned puts and it closed below the strike. When you sell a put you agree to buy at the strike, so they would exercise if the stock is under the strike at expiry.

But you also say in this comment that they're 2.5cs (calls). So which is it?
Wtf are these headlines? "Stocks close low as concerns over rising covid cases and economic impact worry investors"

This shit's been happening all year why start to worry now? Retards.
It's a sign.. We're going to $SPCE soon

Me and many of my dog owning friends had to try CHWY for the first time bc of the pandemic. Now we’re customers for life it’s literally amazon for dog stuff and it gets delivered super fast and is super cheap. Also prescriptions via chewy are incredibly cheap compared to buying them at the vet. This shit will go strong after pandemic even.
Yea, chinese meme stocks very safe and conservative.
nice
I think you meant decrease
Should I put 310 in this mf????
lol look at the comments moron. Most of the people here are legitimately defending it.
there' shouold be a huge rent / housing crisis after the new year starts since many federal backed things are deferred to next year, although they make up a small percent of total rent .. if there's a bailout it would go to lenders not the people like obama did .. real estate corporations figured out rental income is more consistent and profitable than housing since it takes a lot of time to foreclose / court stuff for rent they can evict and get someone in faster
Then you might get assigned. Makes sense. It's below your strike (so base case is assignment). However you might not. It's so close the counterparty will make a decision. It's not the value of the option that matters. It's the strike vs price of stock.
[deleted]
It’s incredible how often these posts get published. Thanks Mods.
One of these pussy ass boomers who are SO smart they only buy when there's a crash. Continue waiting and waiting all year like a little bitch and make no money. I know family members like that and its pissing me off, they're too bitch to buy meme stocks like NIO and sit around like babies when the market goes up around them.
Who is the talented guy who makes all the meme videos. Can he make one for PLTR gang?
true tht was weird, but this is mofo covid time bro

i agree. Although at ATH, $ICLN for example seems primed to skyrocket upon Biden confirmation and (hopefully) USA's re-admittance into the Paris Agreement.
Haha duck youuuuu  for doubting my retard!!
That’s what it’s opening at Monday, your wait will be over
You the idiot. Congress is 100% priced in. Biden is 80% priced in. People still scared of what Trump might do
From rkt to rkt 2 lol
BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES PUSSIES


REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Wow someone lost money today
NIO diamond call holding gang where you at

Assuming that there’s a „roadblock“ of some sort is stupid af. There is no evidence for it, nothing to suggest it. From what we know now, there is nothing stopping us from building a super intelligent general AI.
Caught runs on Tesla Shopify Zoom Netflix Hyliion and PIC. Most the gains came from those bad boys

Holy fuck this is bringing out all the autists.

I have faith that my APHA leaps are gonna print after earnings, especially depending on how it goes down in Georgia
LMAO yes xpeng of all manufacturers is Tesla's match😂😂😂
Way up
SPY call. Played a weekly and I lost 2k. If I had purchased 1 more week out I would have had a nice gain. RIP
lol I always tell my self! support... then spy blasts through the one time I adjust my rule.
but yes, think I need to sell my losers maybe at 50%-60% loss

"Watches today's CNBC segment on small turkeys flying like hotcakes"

&#x200B;

"Writes up an WSB post calling it random thoughts of excess large turkeys"
Imagine caring about downvotes
Feeling strong on my PLTR 5/21 12.5c
They don't own Dot's Pretzels yet, therefore I'm out.
KWEB down 0.35% after-hours but that's opaque
I'll have a roughly $5,500 loss, at that point I'd sell covered calls or just sell the stocks and buy cash secured puts again.  The IV would be thru the roof so I'd probably be able to sell $25 puts for $1k+ per week and I'd do that till I recoup my money

Of course any stock can go to zero and I'll be screwed, but it's no different than owning the stock outright.  If I bought now at $49 and it drops to 30$, I'd be down $9,500 on 500 shares

My strategy (the wheel) is one of the most conservative option strategies that exist, so I'll live with the risks
I think you’re good homie
Bought puts three months out on spxs nothing wrong with a little hedge

Nah, they were 2.5p’s I sold for 0.3 and it closed at 2.49
There are hot key shortcuts -- presumably not hard to bot but I figure it's manually with hotkeys. I just upvoted a ton of people un like 20 seconds.
baba looks like a great play. its tanked in the past few weeks and its trending up. I like it
Works until it doesn’t :)

100% must be error. nah
I have AMD calls too 🤮
PTON was dragging down at the beginning of this week and has proven to be a stock that bounces back big... didnt take luck to simply buy the dip.  Unfortunately for me I got a little too smart for my own good trying to take profits and reposition for cheaper and it skyrocketed away from me.
Lost everything on Nio calls today 😒
There are a few bulls downvoting everyone lmao
Ofc, I’d reserve a week right now
Anyone buy SOLO calls at eod
Jack Ma has an iq of 7 lol

I think this might get a little traction in a real money situation with some rules. 2k account, no single positions greater than 25% of current bankroll or whatever...
was playing 0dte, also was shorting with calls
been there, u will be back, and u will make better trades
20 cocks, 11 burgers over 27 fries
Can mods do something about these fucking downvote brigades?
Monday will be 🔥🔥🔥
Like tyga ?
as a loooong time stockholder (sitting in the mansion the shares bought) and someone who sells covered calls relentlessly....it HAS to make a move soon. It's been stagnant way too long
Why is there a gang of like 5-7 downvoters? I only slept with 3 of your gf/wives, not 5-7.
I have all 1/15/21 calls.  so I’ll probably get some at different strikes.  I’m contemplating selling weekly covered calls to whoever wants FDs, but I dunno if that’s a good idea with a big pop on the horizon...scared to do that.  Lol
not everyone enjoys their first time 🌈🐻 

you'll get used to it
Trump to accept transition by next Friday.  Not concede but accept results and announce 2024 bid.  Really it’s going to be over Monday when Pennsylvania and Michigan certify their states. Trump will be out of options.
How much would I make from 10 $350 Monday contracts if it drops to 345?
When will the index funds / etfs start re-balancing their portfolios with TSLA? I'm guessing some have already started?
LMao you shitting me?
Its bots
TSLA AINT DEAD
This is the way
anyone see that BABA down 4% after hours notification? it shows up on the candles. shady
[removed]
Look at the last month/couple of months average. If ir gets anywhere near its lowest point during that time its usually a good time to invest of course there are exceptions and use your noggin. If a company just been done for tax fraud and it sinks maybe leave that one a little bit well unless tour a  gamblerr
They were on CNBC today but I had no dry powder for it
u/Savethisvideo
sure, if this happens by Monday ill do that too. That would mean i would collect a cool 150K

Lol, AI already exists. You mean general AI? You don’t know what you‘re talking about, please sit down.
Switch to AMD and yes. Garbage stock
lol baba is going to 340
Let’s see it through that we both can kick back after Monday. It’s time to start shilling the SPY!!!!
Message my stock broker in Kenya, Mr. Richie, he can help you get better returns on your roblow if you deposit all your cash with him.
 🌈🐻
Because of the free dip??
Idiot
We should get flair points if we call the market correctly
BUTS ITS NOT JUST A CAR COMPANY !!!\* Visible tears\*
I bought 5 january 15 $19 calls btw :) hopefully it'll work out
🌈🐻 gonna have a good week next week
Yes they still sell like zero cars. Amazing.
Hell yeah I’m at like 250%, still got a bit of a ride up
At first I thought this was a joke, but OP thinks 300-1500 lmao 

Let’s just take the middle of 900

If it hit 900 in 5 years, it would have a market cap of 1.7 trillion.

Damn, that would be a nice loophole. I’m a Robin Hood idiot and they don’t allow it

You are forgetting the paradigm shift in well-of Chinese people. They're starting to prefer premium brands from their own country over US/European products. Nio's growth is spectacular and looking at the long-term the current price is definitely justified. Do you think it's an easy job to achieve what Nio is doing? You're making it sound simple by saying that they buy everything and outsource it all and the wait lines are half an hour blabla.

All I read is a genius play to make it this far with what they have and considering the waiting lines, an increase in popularity that will lead to lots more of these battery swap points in the near future
i named my cock that a couple days ago
Srs q wat material events r ppl who bought puts before close today expecting to happen over the weekend? Or just more covid cases

AAPL is such a piece of shit stock. It's the only thing in my portfolio that kept me from having the best day of trading I would have ever had. Who even buys Apple shit anyway? AAPL APR 150C 💩

so what's the ambition behind Palantir?  are they going to be like a Salesforce for organizations that want a ML farm without the cost of building one and its upkeep?
Good looking out homie 👌

Anyone get happy a stock went up even after it totally fucks you? I just spent weeks averaging down BABA calls I bought in the 290s for them to expire worthless and I still shed a tear of joy for BABA gang today starting their recovery.
yes downvote me cause you're retarded not to take profits after it ran like 200% in 3 days
Please. I have 4 calls at 2.5 for a year from now. PUMP SO I CAN DUUUMP THIS LOAD
A wrong clock is right a few times as well
Patiently waiting on PLTR $16.50 to load the fuck up on leaps.
Lucky u. My wifes boyfriend wont allow me
Damn
no
Depends on the orifice
Not sure if I wanna keep bag holding AMC or dump before the end of the year 😑
I mean you're actually down. If you sold at top and bought when it dropped you'd have WAY more.

I see no reason why a baby who’s clearly capable of wearing sunglasses isn’t able to grab himself a titty to nip his own milk. Lil man obviously knows what he’s doin. Take notes aura. He’s obviously waiting for markets to open on Monday and in the meantime decided to flash some cash so he could get a Tit and a glass. He’s only got 48 hours recoup and regroup

But tesla doesnt just make cars !!!!
*HERTZ has entered the chat*
Exciting stuff. I got in below $3. Tempting to let it go, but the future is EV. I’d probably kick myself 5 years from now.
Right. They hardly make any cars so that comparison is silly.
would have burned you very bad this week. 

Inverse WSB would have been : 

PLTR puts, NIO puts, XPEV puts, BABA puts (after it hit about $265), TSLA puts (at like $460)
GME was kinda disappointing today
I am thinking of yoloing amazon 3200 call, hope papa bezos comes from no where and announce stock split lol
Or just position for it
except last year..
holy fuck that thing went parabolic today
damn missed the 110 at the open cashed in on 97 and 100 tho

I'd just make sure that they're pretty long calls, (I have some for December but just bought some more for April) if you go with FDs you might have a bad time.

holy fuck congrats retard
Progress being made now does not guarantee progress in the future. Just because our understanding of things are increasing and we continue to advance technology in certain areas doesn’t mean it will continue forever or even so far as the limits of current theory. Billions and millions of dollars and people being smarter in their field doesn’t make it ignorant(lol) to question how far progress will go before a roadblock that we don’t presently understand (or even know exists) impedes development
Wow glad it worked out. Good luck bud
What the actual fuck is that stock doing, somehow losing on puts

You will find enough fleece at bridge. No need to waste money. Keep doing what you do best i.e. losing money.
That’s a stop loss yo. But what’s your trade? Fd’s, LEAPS, or stocks?
I bought BNTX heavily about two weeks before the initial vaccine efficacy announcement; I had figured out just about every detail of the announcement that surprised all the analysts - I was confident efficacy was going to be 90% or more (consensus was 50%-70%) and believed the trial was farther along than they let on (it was).

That was my real coup, and it made me quite a bit of money. But I was a complete newb so it was just stocks, no options - I would have made a lot more with options but I discovered them in RH the Friday afternoon before the Monday morning announcement blew it up. One more day of delay before the announcement and I would have made a lot more.

After that initial big jump I’ve just been along for the ride. I think it’s a great long-term investment but don’t have any special insight into short term movements (ie I didn’t predict the big drop from the Moderna announcement, though I knew the announcement was coming).
we’re all new to this lmfao...idk 30? The fact that pltr has large govt contracts makes me bullish
LGVW. Everyone is going to be on this stocks nuts next week. Owner is some genius guy. Their main product is a handheld ultrasound device. Bill Gates and Ballie Gifford already jumped on board. It's going to continue mooning into next week. It's insane that only one or two others have mentioned it.
Whats a potential ten bagger for January ending expiration?
They have competitors in the battery space as well, such as QuantumScape which has VW funding and is building its own giga factories. 

Ultimately, for long term success it’s better to be great at one thing then to dabble in multiple streams of revenue. The bubble will pop.
You passed my P/L for the year. 😥😢
Made 6.5k this week thanks to papa elon, still down 9k all time. 🥲

Still up big on Jan calls and just little red on December.  Not worried at this point.  If it goes deep red on Monday I will reassess.

If PLTR hits $50 i will literally get its logo tattooed on me
It dropped 50% in 2008. You wouldn't know that because this jabroni isn't using a log scale on the chart so that move was 1000 points which looking at the chart scale on the right would barely register. 

Notice the recent drop looks huge but it's only 20%

Neat.
I made 50k during the March crash during the 1st week. Market turned against me that weekend and I left with 25k (I could have kept it in and walked away with 300k if I knew how low it would go.) I feel extremely lucky that I timed the market. I took my money out the market because I was unemployed and missed the recovery. I tried timing the next drop and it only caused me to lose profit. Even Ren tech is down 20% for the year becuase they over hedged during the summer. This bubble could keep getting bigger for the next year or two, so timing it will be next to impossible. Ive set up my portfolio in a way to capture gains, but prepared for a crash.

Stop talking about share prices and start talking about market cap. Share prices mean nothing when comparing multiple companies because one company might have a million shares available while someone like Apple has almost 18 Billion shares available. There’s a reason apple trades at $118/share yet is worth more than Berkshire Hathaway who trades at $341,000/share.

If Palantir shares rose to $60/share they’d be worth more than Lockheed Martin and you’re talking about getting to $300/share. You’re a fucking moron.

Oh, I know. California is basically its own country and I know it has a big EV market there. But outside of California, there is no EV market in the US. There is a reason why Elon shifted his focus to China after California.

Also, it took a long time for super liberals like California to really accept and buy Tesla (at mass scale). It’s gonna take a LOOONG time for people in Idaho to buy EV.

Don’t daytrade. Buy a minimum of 30-35 different shares, don’t overextend, don’t YOLO, let your winners run, average down on stuff that’s down (e.g. BABA the past few weeks). Literally cannot go tits up. I’m in the wrong subreddit am I

It’s only weird if you have to compare him to the average tech billionaire. When he was young he volunteered to be a tour guide in China for foreigners so he could learn English because he saw the rise of the US and how much opportunity there was. He saw the market gap and where trends were heading and how something like alibaba would be useful. He was charismatic enough to sell SoftBank on it, which you retards probably think you could do but somehow you’re still in your moms basement jerking off 13 times a day.

Oil-based economies and companies trying to diversify is a whole different and messy field. It's very common to think that self-driving tech is unrelated but it's the self driving tech that changes the fundamental economics of owning a vehicle, or more than one vehicle per family. Future outlook is to rethink the reason why people opt for vehicle ownership. Why would people not want to use TaaS in the near future when it is expected to be 80-90% cheaper than owning a car. Most researchers in this field agree that fleets of autonomous electric vehicles providing transport as a service is the future transportation system in most urban areas. It will reduce the number of cars on the road. Small players in automobile sector will suffer the most because of such consolidation.  But this may not be the case for rural areas due to the economies of scale challanges.
Best decision I made was buying 5000 shares of NIO when it was at $21 a share, and not selling it. Worst decision I made was buying BABA when it dipped last week to $270, and it continued to fall to $250. Felt like being handcuffed to a dead hooker. Thankfully recovered today though.

Learn how to use Theta and trade the options wheel strategy, you can earn a lot just by soaking up premium. And then if you get assigned you can sell covered calls. You can also make small gains using  verticals and stuff. 

Stay away from trying for giant gains, get some small ones over the next month or two so you don't have that sinking feeling when you place a trade.

It sucks now, but it will make you a better trader in the long run. You'll be ok, hang in there.
Damn I hope I’m reading it right. I thought he meant up 1k then saw his gains decrease by 700. If you’re right fuckn sucks retard!!!

Now take all $50k for PLTR $30c 11/27 you degen
Why is FDX so down and dumping further AH? Just dividend people getting out ? I think the next few weeks looks bullish for them...

To be blunt, if you're asking these kind of questions and browsing this sub, you should probably just light your money on fire and post it here. Post karma is worth more than your money right now.

🥘👄🥘
I have the same problem.  It makes no sense.  I can’t even hold winners past being up 100% let alone hold until expiration.  I think the key might be to set a rule and stick to it.  Like sell when down 50% and sell when up 200% or something like that.  Then you can adjust the rule if there are unique circumstances, like if the market is at a significant support or resistance level.
Need that rotation back into big tech anytime now. When it rotates it jumps up like BABA today.
That million dollar PTON guy should have just put it all in SPHD.

I am dying at this. Have watched many times and will watch throughout the weekend.
It definitely has an EV market. There’s zero chance has cars won’t be highly and monetarily regulated in the future.
I made 58% today. Will pass you soon
that's what you're suppose to do?
My best week on record!
I got lucky several times. Namely this morning with XPEV
\>tfw you buy SPY FD calls just before 4pm and they are down 40% in the next 15 minutes

if you're buying SPY options at end of day, do you wait until it's closer to 4:15 to buy them?
Do you understand what a fiscal year is, or are you just a special type of autistic?
Nothing man, have a good weekend.
I’m a big fat sleazy worthless gay ass fucking bear who been shorting the market since March and using 50% of my paycheque to fund this endeavour. Thankfully I’ve been able to pull off being poor during COVID because there’s nothing to do or go where I live. I will persist. Long live the bears
I’m a nonverbal autist so that’s irrelevant

I think it was just opex - I remembered this happened the Friday before Netflix earnings, I was freaking out because it plunged hard through close - but ended up falling up 1.5% on Monday
sToNkS go up?

Tech stock go up = bubble?
PLTR better recover next week or ima need some $ROPE
Can't argue with that dd
Exactly my thinking. Going heavy in the EV stocks right now, hoping for massive returns in a couple years.
I own them both so I forget which one is better
DD coming soon
Just turned 18 and got robinhood, referred my friend. Got $200. I love stocks because everybody is a winner!
Just buy below VWAP on any given day across several days, or weeks - good way to DCA (look it up) into a position. It's how hedge funds and stock brokers generally build their positions.

Theres a reason you are only seeing a month 😂
1 million new cases!
Someone pass the $ROPE I bailed out of a BLNK $15 call on Wed for a $40 profit with a 12/18 expiration date. Shits currently sitting at $8.20......I really don’t know what I’m doing in life
Is this claim false and misleading?
Solid analysis, get this garçon a beer
Yeah I feel for you im on my second week of no trading because I through away 1k and that was all I had saved since I'm still vibin in highschool
Yep. If it opens below 515 its easy money

Thanks for not buying then lol 😂
So how did you do this week?
No problem bby
I think I'll make a dollar on my 4 pltr 12/18 19c

I'm pretty patient and I don't like to use the manipulation word. But this thing had over 60 million in trading volume. Level 2 showed there was hardly any walls compared to yesterday and we still kept going down.

Short interest has gone down. Still around 32%

Maybe I'm doing this wrong. I'll still wait. But the opportunity cost has been pretty big these last two days since I was torn between putting money in PLTR or BABA.

At least there's some stability in pltr and consistent price action. Seems like the perfect stock for theta gang.
I like staying broke
Every damn person, who makes decent money is salivating at the thought of peniston.
I'm confused by your post, it's almost like you're posting from October.  The vaccines already did drop. And the news has already sent ZM down big.
Managed not to lose money all week and then NVDA dumped :( Feelsbadman
Amazon better go up on anticipation of Black Friday.

Why do that to muffins?
Someone tell me my 20C on PLTR are gonna be ok. Theta gang is about to eat my ass over the weekend

Just stop thinking so much.  Scrabble man proved it.
Should’ve bought the nice fleece
Oh I thought it was all the time every day. Even Saturday somehow.
Yeah I read it wrong. I thought you were referring to the big EVs in the first sentence because numbers are hard for me.
I'd prefer a slower climb to about 290ish. My 275/277.5 11/27 spreads would appreciate the padding.
PLTR bears really celebrating after it’s gone up over 13% this week. Lol hope y’all sold EOD cause that $18 support seems pretty solid.
Any tip for beginners? Hehe
Sometimes it takes them few hours. Are you using margin? Probally not since its way otm. You should be fine. If not just Uninstall find a new broker and tell robinhood to eat rocks

yes I agree with that comparison, spy puts are the most straight-forward way to exercise bearishness. I primarily use spy puts.

You are right. I read a tweet about it earlier and I just googled. My bad. I still shorted (not based on the tweet though although I shoulda done some research on the context of the expenses).

Anyone pick up PLTR calls eod?

February $25 calls were relatively cheap
Same. Green Monday 100%
Everyone ready for the classic giant green dildo on Monday only to slowly bleed out throughout the week
PLTR probably the most undervalued stock on Wall St.
Wasn't really important for the yuks ?? 

Yesterday I posted my gain for the day (not to brag but I made it a joke about it being my birthday present) and people jumped my sh*t. They wanted proof or I would be banned.

But if it is important to you the numbers blocked are 567.

Bought a 357p 12/7 around the same time when I exited my BLNK calls. Godspeed brother bear
Yep everybody's buying calls, hence the underlying hedge bidding up stonk price on low volume
How the fuck does someone come up with a price like that? Do they use maths and if so what maths - or do they close their eyes and use a random number generator between 18,000 and 1,000,000?

I think lockdowns are coming, maybe not all states but the blue states for sure. I mean look at NY and CA. CA announced the 10PM curfew and pretty much every county in the state is in "purple" whatever that means. Granted its CA and NY but these are the places where food delivery will strive
If funds haven’t settled then yes you’ll get a strike but nothing will actually happen

Newsflash: yet another dude who doesn't understand the concept of market cap sets price target based on other companies' stock prices
When is it
PLTR TO DA MOON!
Might stay that way till early 2021 but I bet we see $4,500 next year at least.
There is, but it's mainly used as a hedge. I believe if you are bearish, it's on average better to buy a downside OTM SPY put > upside OTM VXX call, other things equal. On average both aren't great long term, but the expected return is probably slightly better with the SPY put vs VXX call for a direct comparison of only these 2 (obviously you have to pick the strikes to make the two somewhat comparable)
They have a customer retention of 95%. Meaning if they get a customer, odds are they're going to be a customer for life.
Very true, thanks for the response.
I think it'll hover around 18-20 for a while, if only because that's the upper bound of its current price targets. But hey, maybe it'll keep going. $400 profit ain't too bad though.

You greedy gay bears are fucked if you didn’t sell today. Spy 357 Monday.
NIO also knows this, which is why they are not vertically integrated. They can easily buy JAC and be vertical but they choose to spend that money on R&D instead. That’s where the true valuation lies.

Guys we literally always open green on Mondays. Have a nice weekend get drunk and watch the calls print Monday morning
...also price target was raised, so I thought it would pump more. Or at least not crash past where I bought...
Haha fair, what strike? I think it’s purely a hype stock, if we go full legalization I think we see another big spike in Q1
Yea end of day obviously rocky but BABA still closed up over 4% on double average volume
I do think it's just a technical bounce. My guess BABA will trade 265-275 all week next week. 

But who knows!
Hoping these zoom calls print

+10.89% and I’m not even a gay bear 😎
The put will probably get exercised.
This calls for puts. Robinhood autists have already priced in actual eps for Q2 2021, explains why the fuck $ZM is so damn high
Just put this shit in IPOB, or GLNG, and climb back tf up! 
Nah but, sorry for your loss man.
You mean the guy who dumps the market every time he speaks?
Bruh I saw NIO and TSLA coming a mile away , I'm up 100k for the year. I definitely didn't lose 20k on spy puts like a retard

ⓘ This claim is disputed by experts
What’s concerning you?
Thanks brotha 🙏🏼
Because I was out of day trades 😔
I have heard this. Is there no sense to buying OTM in order to condense capital? I think of it in the literal sense of buying a call: 

if on this day it were this price, then I would buy.

which I would if it were sufficiently high enough, as it's probably going parabolic.
Alright I forgive you ARK is fucking killing it I hold 4 of their etfs
why do you keep fucking buying puts

stocks only go up, havent you heard?
I fucking hope so.  Rewarded myself with a big boy PLTR leap today after finally getting back into the green (all time).  Not super pleased about the first 6 hours of the play.  Lol
getting assigned my boy or if your broker is shitty it will just expire ITM and you get nothing lol
No I think that’s bank emergency lending
JD crew here and agreed. But AH JD is falling with SPY so maybe not
I made some deposits yesterday but if I'm doing this week profits/pre-deposit capital I'm up 60% 🤑
Which ones are coming up? AZN?
Lol.. call Robinhood. Sure. Someone will be right with him.
Mmm nothing quite like dark roast coffee mixed with sugar free orange metamucil
Any one else miss the market in march. That shit was so exciting with the trump pressers, weekend dow, circuit breakers, and fears that theyd ban short selling. Now its just january again with meme stocks mooning all over the place

You mean it's gonna go up now.

Anybody worried that Mnuchin has pulled reserve funds?

This could spark a crash if there is also no stimulus forthcoming..
[deleted]
Well my greatest worry is just speculation, but someone might know something we don't and be pushing the stock up for the eventual announcement that Xi is letting Jack Ma off the hook and that ANT can IPO. If that news comes next week there's no doubt we'll have a 10%+ up day. Maybe even a jump to 310 or beyond. That 11/27 300c would cuck my gains hard.

Then again, this bounce could just be because BABA was getting oversold and its just recovering from the old bad news.

I think if we open sideways on Monday I'll buy the calls back, since a weekend of theta will have made it a positive gain for me.
You underestimate the power of the dark side
got it, thanks mate
They did well and I sold cause I’m a fuckin bitch lol
I did it with $2.6k to $10.8k~ also in 2 weeks. PLTR, nio mostly and sprinkles in a little penny EOW calls in SOLO, SQ, BABA etc.
If you don't have the capital you can't exercise them.

....so they're gone. Worthless.
EV is more than a modal shift. The self driving tech is unrelated and doesn’t change anything. Same goes for shared mobility.

It’s about changing energy sources. Bloomberg (TV channel) covers the middle east markets on Saturday morning. They cover how the countries in the Gulf are trying to adapt to a post oil world. The UAE and its neighbors made a deal with Israel. They already had startups coming to Dubai to pitch to the Emeratis who are now their VCs. Everybody was excited about doing business with each other. They even had their guests on their national TV. 

Anyone thought any of these was remotely possible 5 years ago?

Jared doesn’t get any credit, these guys have been talking for years and the oil kings see the future. It’s not great if they don’t diversify quick. 

This is no Dotcom. China is a big oil importer, they start to switch, massive geopolitical implications. The same is happening in the US for all states that depend on oil.
hey man gay bears have rights too

I think Tesla is good at its value because of the giga factory’s insurance and auto drive but the others are a bubble
they have a charging network and make their own batteries.

autopilot is sick go check out some videos of the beta on youtube

they are ahead of everyone
Uncertainty going into the weekend. There is always a chance of some news causing a slight pullback (maybe september levels or a bit less) especially because of the rising cases and some new lockdowns (i know i know “market don’t care about corona” but it’s just the fact that these events raise concern over said catalyst potentially happening)
BLNK?

I can’t even. I am at a loss for words.
I did that with VOD and regret not getting the options lol

I'm glad you did what I wanted to do <3 Enjoy
Eventually it will go all digital, just not there yet.  I keep seeing numbers like "80% of games sold are hard copy" lately from the console developers (think nintendo had some kind of press release recently.

&#x200B;

But GME knows this is the case, and is pushing to change in advance of that.  They have 5 billion in sales now and are trading at basically cash on hand (around 800 mill).  This thing is going to print hard.
I shorted GSX shares. Trying this one more time. It's clearly a fraud (on its earnings today, it seems like they even made up expenses this time to cover their ass), but it's whether I can withstand the gamma squeezes. It reported an expense of 300 million USD which is more than what Intel spends in a quarter, but they had to do that since they probably have been inflating revenue and are under SEC investigation.

guess which startup didn't make the list? >!(the tiny tricycle one)!<

and look how much competition TSLA has:

\>not only are traditional car companies making EVs (GM, Ford, Mercedes, VW, etc.)

\>there are at least 11 startups well on their way

why is TSLA worth so much?
What did her boyfriend say?
Was +$1k on SQ 12/18 calls. Now -$250. Holding, but what a bunch of bullshit
NVDA calls for next week
Day trader.  I play both sides and just trade the levels
# That -99.7% tho
Cryptos, weed, fake meat, EVs, biotechs, REITs, ridesharing apps, rare earths, etc. It's just one never ending carpet bombing of pumps & dumps. Each time a village of greedy retail dudes gets napalmed to the bone. And some even come back for more as parents or big governement bail them out

Does Tesla actually own their battery tech or not. Because if Panasonic owns it, then Tesla is just another car company. Every car company has their own proprietary software and AI.

Woah....SPY $354.50 AH...
I have 12/31 20c
Just replace pltr with xpev and this video would be perfect, no hate
I’m all calls and brass balls
I need for a news article to come up that says the Covid deaths have been proven to prop up the market so my itty bitty call can make money.

Why did i buy an EOD call.
Hello

Wife asked how investments going when walking into Starbucks, I flash our PLTR calls up 1k at open like I got this babe. As I get in car I think maybe I should have sold, it's all good. The rest of the day I watch it tank to -700. 

On to Monday!
Are you a permabear tho?
Have been looking at Blnk since July... Never entered, and that's why I don't win

Raise me, ya bunch of homos. I’m calling. I shipped it all this week ready to crash and burn. Who wants to bet a hundred on a coin flip? I need some coke. Gotta keep this feeling going till 9:30 Monday. Cmon do it. Pansies.
Calls is shown 3 times and puts only 2 times calls is upvoted more so calls on monday
I’ve got $300
Maybe.. but 🌈🐻 do not slap around here
Probably not what you want to hear but 10k is nothing in the scheme of things. It might take some months but you can easily get it back. God speed
To Valhalla and beyond
Agreed, I’m confident in PLTR, just a little unsure on the short expiration. As for BLNK, I’m just not sure what my target exit should be I’ll see where it’s at Monday and adjust
Someone just picked up 150k shares of baba at 271.74

Do they announce lockdown news over the weekend?
So do we dump next week because people wouldn’t want to leave money in the market over the holidays? 🤔🤔🤔 am I stupid for buying $25k worth of tech calls 🤔

Just sold my first cash secured puts 

5 NIO 12/18 $44p @3.12 ($1,560 proceeds)

Figure if they execute, at least I'll have a 10% discount from the current price on 500 shares of a company on the rise
We were red today because of the lol yachty concert
Welcome to the family
No... if I wanted to brag, I would have said that I'm in a lower tax bracket than you.
PLTR straight up. Opening 20+ Monday.
DD: bear r fuk
Opphh they gonna exercise them, hope you got the capital.
Guys I wrote 11/27 300c as a bit of cheddar for my 12/18 300c but I'm afraid BABA will actually gap the fuck up and hit over 300 next week and cuck me on my gains. As I wrong to think this way? Does BABA typically move slow enough that we shouldn't even expect 300 next week?
In a lot of puts- ready to feast monday
I did a 25c 12/4 lol, was expecting to keep shooting up after the government monies announcement

Buy assets rather than options  and your risk is lowered

Please be memeing
Check edit on comment
If you made this move I'm happy for you!

He'll be ostracized more than usual.
Lmao bulls don’t worry, we will get more positive news over the weekend and and SPY will be 370 Monday 🤴🏼
$ROPE
Get fucked
Am I the only one that thinks pltr is a shit stock?
Paper hands or did they do well?
How much do you think it will be end of 2021? I know it's too long of a time question I'm still new to this shit lol
True
Yeah goldfish attention spans. Anything not monotonically increasing is a "dip" and real dips are a "crash"
thread looks like bear party. end of the world is near. actually hlaf a percent down. lul
Lmao you actually did crash it, fucking legend
SPY tanks EOD but CCL booms. 

"hey honey, sell our investments, screw this lockdown and virus, we're going on a cruise!!!!"

OK.
With onlyfans in the all time highs and growing? INVERSEEE
I sold half and bought RIOT which also tanked so lmfao
I just saw that movie. Pretty good stuff.
Drill team 6 up in this bitch
The bears get their 1 day per week, as is tradition
I am too, but one of the big banks (think it was JPMorgan) said it expected SPY to gain an additional \~10% for rest of year, so I'm a bit less eager with my puts
And definitely never been inside her
10k for a solar battery
this is so dumb, all day flat only to have a huge sell-off at the end and AH when we can't do shit. It's clearly just retail trading right now lol, no volume to move price intraday.
Stolen election. Great vaccine.  Disobey lockdowns.
I love this shit !!!  All in on fucking PTON.. LOL
Correct
Dude you don't have a portfolio. You have a gambling account.
Is that your severance package post tax?
and the promise is currently being fulfilled
They're going for 7800 dollars a contract as of close today. Stfu and stop lying, put your money where your mouth is
Thanks for pointing this out.
Because I don't think another february-esque crash is possible in this environment.

But 10-15% in a week? Totally possible.
Today was June 10th. See you guys on June 11th, Monday.
Fuck your calls
Why we dump at close
They sucking dik, and when they suck dik, covid gets passed on

But in all seriousness, covid is everywhere, in bodies, on clothes, furniture, and white people think they can just "man up" against a virus
Can’t wait to hear about the PLTR upgrades from institutions and the new contract signings on Monday! PLTR TO THE MOON!
we're actually still on trend to close Monday at $19+
Just bought my first call ever. PLTR 11/27 @19.78 to break even. Hopin i make a few cents
I wish she would put GBTC back in ARKK
Trimmed my AAPL position the last two days and it felt great
Anything special about TSL or is it all just speculation of another potential meme stock?

Guys Robinhood didn’t close my 22 spy contracts that expire today wtffff do I do
Yes
$PLTR is up 13% on the week, goes down 85 fucking cents today and you autists are crying bankruptcy smh
So will this upcoming crash be known as the Thanksgiving crash or Black Friday?
ride the rocket next week with me brother
You forgot about CROX
which ones, the ones that made me money or my current ones?
I am both long and short, but concerned abt short positions
Think of thousands of letters in a book. Their software is showing you how those letters make words. Then showing how those words create sentences. Then you can start reading the sentences, you start to understand the letters (data) you are looking at. I hope that helps.

Fuck. I closed my puts way too early.

And bought a cheapo call EOD.

Fuuuuuuck im a pussy 🐻
Dude, common now.  You should know better than this.

Tesla has been running for most of the year, its holders love the company and the likelihood of it popping in that time frame is not high.  On top of that, the EV part isn't even the biggest draw.  It will likely dominate the self driving (and thus ridesharing) market.  Cars doing ridesharing on their own while you work or watch TV.  Also, their battery tech is crazy and adds massively to their future potential.

&#x200B;

But the reason this is the most stupid.  You aren't shorting tesla, you are shorting the tech market, as we go into the winter with ATH case numbers in a pandemic.  Seriously dude, why

Oh, and Tesla has to be added to a fuckload of ETFs now.  That makes a huge dump even less likely
Some 🤡s yesterday predicted a circuit breaker today lmao
Everyone knows it’s a bubble but still not gonna stop it from climbing until s&p finalizes all its share purchases necessary, the longer it takes the bigger the bubble will get, don’t ask just go for the ride.

Roblox Robs dicks, gay ass bears love dicks. Puts on dicks and dicks on Roblox... puts
I did the other way swing, started up a lot, ended -$3800. BABA, FSLY winners. CCL, PTON (puts), SNAP (puts).  Losers...
My name fucking slaps
I see, fingers crossed then
I also think Tesla is massively overvalued but here's at least a counterargument: Apple owns only 15% of the smartphone market and yet it is more valuable than pretty much all the other smartphone makers (Samsung, Motorala, Acer etc) combined. Why? Because they've built a highly integrated software/hardware experience, have the best platform, and can thus command much higher margins.

The bull case for Tesla is that they basically become the Apple of EVs. Better hardware, more integrated software, premium experience, high margins.

It's a long shot, and they will face stiff competition along the way but that's the path to victory.
> but look they’ve got tequila too

TSLA to 690 next month grab your 690c cuz you know Elon chan will make it happen
Hoping for a weekend of unrelenting chaos to drive VIX up and SPY down to a penny stock
I guess I'm thinking 3-4 years out.  Drives will be 3-4tb.  Older catalogue will likely all be on subscription service style.  

We'll see how it plays out.

Grabbed 6 Monday FD SPY 366 calls at 3:57 for a nice little game and they already down 11% and it just keeps tanking AH. Let's hope we get that vaccine pump with a little side of stimmy news Monday morning !
Poor retarded bulls.

And when do you think the entire world will ban gas cars? 2040? 😂😂😂

That's already massive speculation on your part. 

Even when the world was 100% gas cars we didn't see those kinds of retarded valuations of companies like Toyota. So somehow, let's say it's a 100% ev world, tsla is still somehow worth double Toyota. Man that's retarded

Ballsy move as there are many more possible catalysts for a magical gap up over the weekend (like usual) than anything that would bring the market down.
Sorry I just saw this comment, I just recently started looking at BABA, so I’m not very familiar on the way it moves, personally I’m bullish on it, but I wouldn’t be able to tell you where it’s going.
BA calls😁😎
RIP to all the bagholders who thought PLTR was “just getting started” after going up 98% in less than a month
let me help you, BABA and GO
Best of both worlds
This is when the dump started

***US President Trump will participate in the virtual G20 this weekend, according to a senior administration official***
Less flavor that way I’m good homie
COVID daily new deaths chart looks very bullish. I think we see ATHs in deaths next week.
Big downsies next week. BA put holders in lambos
I lost like 5k of initial deposit but kept depositing money to cover my shame. up 30k first week. Easy gainz
Everyone is so bearish for no reason. Hivemind set.

11/27 @ 120c AAPL
Eff these cash gang 🌈🐻who don’t have the minerals to hold over the weekend. I pray for the biggest donkey Kong size gap up Monday morning!
I tripled down today. I feel like we are cashing in over the next week or two. Charts are looking extra ripe.

I can type numbers too 😂
Burned 2.6K today... just deposited more into my account lol
Hold on their champ blnk is on a temp run, it could be up big on Monday but I feel pltr is the much better long call
Tesla’s valuation is due to its potential in battery technology. They’re creating the platform and the vehicle, but the former surpasses the latter by orders of magnitude if they come out on top.
Please reopen the market so I can cash out these sweet ass puts before the Monday bounce!
the premium for longer calls is mad bread
If you bought high, keep buying, we are going to the moon baby 😎😎
A lot of tech stocks just went towards their highest option pin end of day. FB - 270. AMZN - 3100. MSFT - 210. None of that matters for next week.
Anyone have TSLA 11/27 500c or higher?
oy
My BA weekly 190 puts gonna print or am I fuk... also PTON calls🙏🏼
[removed]
And down to $0 next week
Yeah I’ve learned that swing trade > buy calls
Man, thanks for this advice! Was able to get out of the 11/20s at the peak.
I hate losing going into the weekend
LOL ITs not stopping hahah Futes going to open limit down! (sunday)
BABA and BYND, witness me.
Seriously, people want to be dirty, diseased mouthbreathers as a fuck you to someone who told them to clean something once.
normally I would predict a green bounce monday, but like, shit is still selling off hard. Which is really rare for a Friday.

We might be heading towards a little mini-crash here.
confirmed retard
it went from 400 - 500 this week. it’s gonna be back to 2000 by 12/18.

Convinced that the algorithm is broken and that it's impossible for corsair to go down. It's fucking nuts how much money I've made off of positions that would tank on any other stock.
I couldn't make a winning play if my life depended on it
I’d tell everyone that the logical thing is to buy puts on airlines and cruises due to massive increases in cases/deaths, but that would leave out the fact that the stock market does everything in its power to make sure I lose all my money
On the real how do you get a flair around here without getting banned?
What is Don Don gonna tweet this weekend?
ITS HAPPENING
pltr is long term play
I’m sure you probably enjoy rum ham too. TSLA 11/27 500

shut the fuck up with that stupid shit. Go shill at r/investing

We all know this is an EV bubble but nobody cares. OP is retarded as fuck when he should just be riding the wave.
all the big tech money probably flowing to fucking EVs reeeeeeeee

someone save my amzn calls
😏
OPEX
It’s funny because righties only like Ford.
Except you have institutions saying shitcoin is the new gold standard.
I see you've never met old money rich white people.
nah bruh, up
She said that today?
Maybe I’ll dump the BLNK Monday at open and cut my losses, then throw eem all in on more PLTR shares
It should test $13 at open Monday before drilling lower throughout the week
These 375 is NOT going to be printing on monday FUCK!
Full self driving was promised 3 years ago
Cashed out of most of my Corsair ATVIs losses were made up and fully out of that shitshow now
vaccine pump on monday
Bro I bought in eod yesterday. Expert level buy high
I would be very happy with a green Monday.
I’m so 🐻ish for next week. 🌈 🏳️‍🌈
I bought a MSFT Jan call during final seconds, right after it dropped -1%. I wish I bought two; earnings in two weeks and the calls seem cheaper than usual
He he...BABA didn't fail me! Was able to salvage my 11/20 calls only at 20% loss. My 11/27, 12/4, and 1/15 calls are up

Go BABA!
Don't feel too good with jp morgan downgrade
I'll be happy if it's there. Do you think putting $500 and letting it stay there will be a good idea or pull out at the end of the year?
Not unless there's pictures...
Everyone here is equally dumb, idk google it
brrrrrrrrrrrrr
The great reset tho
I am the dip
[deleted]
Vacay, having some Opus Fuente cigars with Mcallen and not FOMOing on NIO. Why
Wrong again I got in a long time ago
10%+ day and a 60%+ week...left some money on the table with tesla, but I'm sure I would've f'd it up if I would've held. 50% cash right now waiting to see what the weekend brings before going back in
So many bulls talking shit this morning finally something shut them up
they have crazy retard strength
Should I sell my DOCU calls and run with the profit or baghold
ill buy the beers, sounds like today wasn't a good day. watch GMHI for a good point to enter... probably $12.50. god speed fellow tard.
this volume is drab and uninspired. I demand volume that is avant-garde, refined, and erect. Although, it's nothing that you wouldn't expect from a man with a taste for the finest of things. I mean duh
I know this is Wallstreetbets but trying to bet when the bubble will burst is some next level retardation
KODK
*people in the weekend thread 7 min after it’s posted:* FIRST BITCHES, MODS I WANT FLAIR
A single red week would thanos snap half of this sub.
JPM's YouInvest does the same -- idiotic.
Wtf does the company even do besides move sort of with bitcorn. I wouldn’t mind seeing some real DD on these guys.
[deleted]
Stay calm and collected bro. You’ll get it back.
I need spy to pump to 360 so bad
how will i sleep

retard zoom out your graph to even a week
 Stock market is teaching that little bitch Mnuchin a lesson
Gap down Monday?
Man I knew I shouldve held onto puts, but I've been burnt so much on puts I cant trust them to last a weekend.
There’s no time to figure out what it is! Sell the dentures, and Nana’s insulin, as well as that extra chromosome you’re toting around while you’re at it! Buy, buy, BUY! 

You’ll never have a better opportunity to buy high!
You're right, it's not human to human contact it's the 5g towers.
Wait this meme stock ive been dumping money into hinges on there being another osama bin laden?
I'm from Baltimore and this meshes with my regional bias. Fuck it, let's do it.
Proud to be a valiant bagholder of PLTR.
Stock market is teaching that little bitch Mnuchin a lesson
Lol I bought that bitch at the tippy top 😂. Was down 390 but it fucking did a v recovery shits retarded strong
Lockdown play
you're 10th
From an honest standpoint, it's totally ok as long as you don't have the YOLO mindset a lot of people here do. It's definitely worth checking out the stocks being hyped up, but maybe don't just go all in, spread the buying power across at LEAST like 5 stocks, none of this 80-100% in 1 hit-or-miss scenario some of these people do.
Sell it covered
Get Some kodk in there
I don't know what PLAN is but I'm bagholding now 

also got a lotto spy 360 FD so tank incoming Monday, sorry everyone
thanks
Awww you got in late so you need it to break 20.
[deleted]
Who didn't!
Lol fuck yea dude. I sold my calls way too early today but I’m gonna hop back in baba and sq next week at any dip. I’m thinking March SQ calls way out the money and sell right before earnings in February
Loaded up on blnk leaps today, wish me luck
*squints suspiciously*
and i could finally hit puberty..... not gonna happen
The feather game was really fun today until they dumped literally everything at close
Pajamas excited they got a juicy dip to buy this Sunday
maybe if you bought leaps
SPY PUTS GET YOUR SPY PUTS
Bought a few MSFT, NVDA, and AMZN shares end of day. It's shares but I realized this strategy of just swing trading shares (treating them like weekly options time horizon but with no theta decay) is pretty good when the market is rangebound. It worked really well on BABA, so trying in on these 3 now who all went down for no reason.
all your meme lockdown stocks didn't-- ZM, BABA, PTON
Fuck me if it goes that high because I put $500 in my account but it will come next Friday smh.
[deleted]
Just the truth. And I am a share holder haha
Happy weekend all you arseholes! 

See you Monday morning.
Euros stay bagholding lel
SNAP calls next week anyone?
CRSR go brrrrr while market goes guh
he can't, cHyNa send him to reeducation camp  😂
Right when I bought calls

Nice
If you seriously think that's how it spreads, you're a walking superspreader.
Hey guys
At least I'm making money and having fun.

You keep trying
Buy stocks ah, mondays are usually green
The trick is to buy low sell high, what’s the next yolo
If you have just the slightest addictive personality do yourself a favor and don’t do options trading
All of wsb does.
I’m scared
Its happening right? Spy 100p 11/23
Imagine thinking we don't open at 340 Monday
20 realistically
[deleted]
Send pics
Oh fuck off that's bragging not losses you cunt
[removed]
Just sold my pltr calls today, all WSB retards holding it made me scared
Cash gang cause I'm chicken
Nice bought 550c today for dec expiry
You’re welcome
Then that will be good for me
Went full Bear Mode today and already seeing the green.  ROAR baby.
horrible idea. seriously.
[deleted]
Got a chinafolio of calls and SPY puts. Sorry America
Yup
Bro you lost $98

That is not fuk
[removed]
I gave up on it. Lost so much trying guess. If the tracking tickers ever pop again I am going to try for puts.
Nah you just won’t get as many tendies as everyone else. Wait for a green day next week then sell and rebuy for a later date. Stonks only go up!
amazon used to just sell books online. there were probably comparing it to other book companies back in the day, just like people are only comparing tesla to other car companies right now. but look they’ve got tequila too
yes i bought spy calls for next week
damnit 3:59:59pm on a friday is so sad
Every AAPL dip I bought the past 2 weeks goes to shit and my LEAPS been about breakeven for 3 months
Sometimes when I'm home alone, I like to strip down naked, cover myself in vaseline and lay on the floor and pretend I'm a slug.

TL;DR: TSLA 12/28 600
Cant wait to hear about Pltr mooning .10 percent
Only buy shares, never options
it can only go up
my skittles are stiff after all that greeeen
[deleted]
You're 3rd. Try again next week
have a good weekend boys
I feel so empty now when the weekend hits.
Loaded up on SQ calls before the bell
Don't know. Watch on Monday. 👍🏽
Idk if I am a bull or bear if I buy zoom calls
$5.5k in FB 01/15 290c
$12k in AMZN 12/04 3200c
$7k in NVDA 12/04 527c

Wish me luck guys. Either making a lot of tendies, or GG WP 😥😥😥

Jacked in spy 360 calls. Someone tells me I have a 5bagger in my future
Cathie Wood said that digital coin could hit 500,000 lmfaoo
Reluctantly crouched at the starting line Engines pumping and thumping in time
Buy stocks ah, mondays are usually green
Bruh 187k new covid cases in a day wtf
Notice how $ZM didn’t sell off? MM knows there’s going to be a catalyst over the weekend
Don't confuse arrogance with confidence buddy. They're two completely different things. Stay irrelevant
Wow, fuckin wow!
which vaccine company is pumping next week?
PLTR pump starting 5:31pm @ me
[removed]
Time frame for that type of squeeze would be impossible to guess without insider info.  It would basically come down to when a vote was called (if a vote is called).  I went deep in april calls because I'm a little risk adverse.  I do see the stock going up from here before january, I'm expecting at least $20 by EOY personally.  Kinda just have to wait and see, but I hope it happens, and happens by january as well.  Looking at possibly a few hundred k here for me as well if it happens
how is EBAY
Still here. Just waiting for mods to ban me. Or has my account evolved to be ban proof.
Sir, this is a casino.

Step right up.
As is tradition anything I buy drills and anything I sell rockets.
Friggin retard
which autist is the one buying all those damn 12/04/20 370C today? jesus fuck
You swine
Okay universe, this week I'm ready to earn money
Yes. And that’s what I’m looking at. TSLA is producing 300,000. NIO is producing 60,000 (but plan to produce 100,000 in 2021). 

How many is Toyota producing for EV?

Can’t compare ICE and EV production numbers.
I need some optimism here. Realistic prediction for PLTR Monday?
OMG since yesterday, you're giving me Vine flashbacks
https://youtu.be/y-P0m0M_8pc
I love this BABA talk. Keep it up over the weekend
Not a bad idea if you don’t mind ducking your life up and are young to recoup it. I lost 7k few months ago. thought a few hundred would be bad but addictive tendencies have me back at it.

This shit is really tired. We get it, it’s overvalued. What’s your actual plan? 

Ban.
[deleted]
Wait, so NIO didn’t run up even faster than PLTR? And still continuing to do so?
Tesla is just a car company for now and people arguing otherwise are retards...no just because they can update and add new features to the car over the air doesn’t make them a tech company..atleast not in terms of where their revenue is coming from..most of teslas revenue comes from selling actual cars..not software..fsd and software makes up a very small part of their revenue..tesla is overvalued to tits regardless of whether u think it will dominate the future ev market or not..
no one in this thread will notice how gay i am

Don’t homie. 30% of my portfolio is stuck bagholding metals
Funny how XPEV isn‘t pushed as much here.
Yeah I don’t think March is really the baseline you want to be basing growth off of. It’s chart doesn’t look a whole lot different than Canopy’s over the past year.  There definitely isn’t enough of a gap to justify how much more buying power you have to burn on it.
https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxxiry/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/
I keep seeing this, but couldn't you say this about any EV company at this point?  And couldn't you say that about Toyota, Ford, etc.?  With a quick/superficial search, 90% of Toyota's revenue comes from automotive sales and 80% of Tesla's comes from automotive sales.  *shrug*

I literally don’t understand this comment. You’re saying two things.
Terrible ending for me. Dropped like 3k at the end. But I'm actually up (barely) for the 11th straight day, which is my longest streak ever (maybe in April when every day was green I had a longer one but didn't keep track then).
nah
Wrong the bottom is 18 that is the max it’ll retrace. Going to pass 20 next week
weekend!
Welp I'm in with 100 shares

what a shame
18 bottom for PLTR?
$ROPE looking mad bullish right about now
I pussied out of Tesla calls at close so Monday it’s probably gonna break $500 and surge to 550+
PLTR is a govt meme stock which means bigbux especially if theres another bin laden. 

30 EOY calling it now. 

150 2022 if there's another war
Everyone talking about the lil dump doesnt have enough CRSR
Cathie Wood FOMOing back in the shares she sold at the bottom.
This sub makes me feel like a genius
This is the way.
You're such a "very, very, very risky trader"!
How many of you waited until today because you thought might get luck on some dailies?? Be honest
It’s so stupid. I lost $7k and my all-time-chart looks like I lost $3k lol

That’s the one thing I’ll give RH
[deleted]
And that gives you a short squeeze? That’s not even high that’s just hedging. It’s not a direct short and even if it was it’s not high either. That reading if anything says the market is still too bullish.
Pay the $.65 anywhere else and you'll get a fill
Good Luck!

Sitting on baba calls bought at the bottom and solo puts bought at the top, along with spy puts for shits and giggles. For once I feel confident going into the weekend
Well shit.....7 day work weeks keep making me forget when it's Friday... Hands are straight diamonds no matter what when it's Saturday and Sunday :/
Aight maybe I'm using the wrong term. But real easy day of finding meme EV stocks, buying bulk calls to ride the trend and selling them after quick 15% gain.
Fuck me
Lol you made the #1 mistake, assuming the general population is intelligent.

I think it’s mostly where it hasn’t been before like the midwest and shit
Whoever wrote this article your moms a hoe

Very legal!

PLTR will be fine honestly probably just a healthy pullback today. Next week will pump again but probably not as much as the 13% we saw this week still think there’s a chance it gets over $20 by end of next week.
Expiry?

CALLS
ya a lotta golf happens inthe wintertime
How the fuck is covid still spreading? Who's spreading this 9 months into the pandemic? Are people not just staying home and washing their hands every time they leave?
or bahn
They filed something with the SEC for the short position back when GME was expected to go bankrupt (I was expecting it as well until this summer).  It has been posted here a few times but I don't have a link handy, should be feasible to find though
Hopefully you're settling calls against them shares?
I bought TLS at the end of the day you fuckers better be right
Planning on doing that after exercising my original PSTH.U Dec 20c position next month!

What???? How would you get those so cheap?
Lmao I hope this is sarcasm.
The realness right here. I’m 17k deep on PLTR but kind of wish I would have yeeted that hard at AYRO instead.
you probably write these walls of incoherent text because you get paid per word to do it
What u guys think about Monday prolly +2%?
**It’s not a car company**
Are you younger than 20
January 4.5 calls here!
They don’t always get assigned even if they’re itm

I was holding 16c's hoping to hit 20 today. Sold for a profit and bought longer dated 18c's instead. Here's hoping for some tendies boiiii.
Last few days have just been consolidation and setting the floor at $18, this is good for the next few weeks

That's ez money right there 👍🚀🚀🚀
Bought calls at 18.15, sold when it went up a bit before going down to 18.12
haha, shit quality DD. Folks still think comparing apples to oranges makes sense, lmfao. Tesla may be overvalued, sure. But they’re one of the few companies actually producing next-gen automobile technology. It’s not just cars, it’s primarily the AI and battery tech. They’re making a huge gamble in AI tech and if it pays off they’ll have a lead like no other. They’re battery tech is at least 5yrs ahead of anyone else. But ya know, hurr durr Ford sells more cars
Same, they’ve robbed me of my limited edition halo 3 360 by offering me a measly $13.. my young mind thought that was enough weed to hold me over for years

Everyone don’t panic, will make the majority back in futures like we always do.
Not sideways when you bought at the top :,(
I picked up some GE calls OTM expiring 27th. They were a couple bucks a contract, worse comes to worst and I'm not really out that much, but if it pumps then I get a nice little treat.
We'll see. 2 days for any news to blow up.
Gotcha I got a lot of learning to do. I have some money saved up but not working only studying for some exams so I said fuck it decided to give it a shot. I'll probably do something similar as you for Dec 18 but I still need to understand it more. 

It’s now past 1pm and in total from 2 days I made $101.91 so I'm pretty happy from that haha. An extra $500 I put in my Robinhood but that will come next Friday so hopefully I'll still be able to buy PLTR at a decent price and just let it stay there
After initial dump at 80K volume on SPY, pump volume was 17K, then dump volume 124K.  Fake pump on low volume but real dump
I did it! Broke through the 25k mark for the second time. Bought a TSLA 500c for next Friday to go back under!
lmao exactly, you tryna make money or not

i bought 11/27 @ 120c lol was so cheap
3 day trades but it's not really like that. Think of it like this: you have three day trade tokens. Reach time you but and sell anything in the same day-pre market, normal hours, after market- you give up one of those tokens and you don't get it back for 5 business days
Yes, and Amazon stock was $93.75 on 11/26/99 - which is a steal at today's prices. However, if you would have waited till June 23rd to purchase, you could have picked it up for $34.
I don't disagree that their valuation is insane at the moment but you also have to note that it includes their AI tech, battery tech and their energy production/storage solutions.
If they can replace truck/cab drivers and provide battery farms for clean energy storage worldwide, the company is undervalued.
The dotcom bubble had two useful companies with high valuation - Amazon and EBay. And this bubble will be the same, probably with Tesla being one of them.

But there will be plenty of worthless companies in the EV sector 3-5 years from now.
BABA says hello
*bulls
Its anot about elon. Its about us national security. Tesla is the chosen one to vs the chinese. So the govt dumps huge loads of cash on tesla. Also space z being attached to musk helps him bring more investors. The intelligence agencies love space x because they can launch certain payloads bypassing disclosure of what it actually is and whom its meant for. Ill just leave at that.
Hope theres some + in there too
Sooooo NVAX’s turn Monday morning?
Surely they aren't shares
Spy 368c 11/23 is literally free money
nope. it was a trap
that's a big book
Fun day scalping EV calls. TSLA & NVDA calls bought right at close. Hope the world doesn't catch on fire over the weekend.
Thanks
Damn that sucks. Sorry homie
r u a top?
Amazon survived the dot com crash and is now the leader in its space. The weak ones were destroyed.
PLTR moon mission on hold boys, cheap calls get em while you can. Spy puts!!!
Go fuck yourself. You bitch ass piece of shit. I’m sorry I had a bit to much to drink working from home. Great work chico/a. Congratulations!
A

Definitely not C
tbh there is never a reason to hold raw puts or calls over the weekend. converting to a spread before close  is always the move
twice the money by waiting it out till the end lol literally sold at the last moment possible.
Of course.  It is just very unlikely that any stock goes up that much in such a short period of time and those are pretty hard to pick ahead of time or we'd all be mega rich.  This one has a clear path to run that hard via the most intense short squeeze in history.

To be clear, I'm not buying (nor would I suggest anyone else buy) based on the assumption that it will squeeze.  One should buy because it is an insanely undervalued turnaround story and it really only has one direction to go from here, up (aside from little blips).
For real
ciic obviously
Market makers can’t buy weakness if they don’t create it
I'm starting to worry about my SPY 360c expiring today
Snap with the ✌🏻 shape recovery eod
tits deep in Nvda, workday, and baba calls.
Went from the chad to a boomer after the split
600 is more likely around their next earnings if they hit 500000 vehicles for the year, but maybe?
Another perspective is to look at the projected demand of vehicles in the future, which is just 20% by 2030 because of the autonomous driving technologies. Less cars simply means less cars, be it EV or ICE.  EVs are not a bubble but simply a modal shift but Autonomous driving pushing Transport as a Service is the real game here.

In the midst of a pandemic this is the stock that must go up while Microsoft falls down. 

Makes sense. Inverse logic, beat bezos.
y u jinxed it, not it will open red

Right behind you with NVDA 525s
Yup just lost 120+ on pltr calls
Wtf is wrong with AAPL

I’m not sure if this is possible for you or if it’s even legal but I had my wife make an account and I just control it.. she used it for a bit but after I discovered she was 🌈🐻 I took over
Yeah my bid on a NIO spread was beyond the ask at one point and still didn’t get filled
Was +$1k on SQ 12/18 calls. Now -$250. What a bunch of bullshit
Bought in right before market close. Dropped to almost 19. Fuck me daddy.
You mean in the US? There are other markets outside of the US. 

I agree that US has no EV market though. That’s why I think all the US EV play is just a dud. There is definitely “anti-EV” sentiment/attitude among the US consumers. They love their gas guzzlers!
The darkest day in PLTR history. 

But we've filtered the pesky day traders, fake bulls, and the pathetic paper handlers, so that's a good thing.

Remember Skynet, AI B2C scaling, and the power of Thiel. Let's strive for a modest yet decent gain of 1 to 2% per day next week.
Was she hot
I've literally made +%30 of my portfolio on nio puts in the past 8 days so...
Thanks to my meme portfolio I had a great day.  Thank you fellow autists.  Back within sniffing distance of break even all time.
This is the way
I bought some 0DTE FB 270P for literally 2 cents each this afternoon and sold in the last minute for 0.30, that was actually wild
I want MSFT at 230, AAPL at 140, AMD at 100, BABA at 320 on Monday open. Is it too much to ask? 😂😂
I'm not against Chamath.  It is just my envy s-talking.
So am I the only Degen that takes some weekly gains just to have money to play the cryptos on the weekend?

If the ticker isn’t moving, up or down, I feel dead inside.
Stop using a shit broker.
Was today a red day? I was only looking at BABA.
Just a little bit of hope there at the end....

Then back down to hell
SPY about to spring back up on positive guidance
oh riiiiight... that "edited 14 minutes ago" that coincides with your post 14 minutes ago calling me a retard is just by coincidence. god speed, tard. make sure you submit your wendy's application before you lose your money.
Damn, i felt good about my 11% week 😔
Have a nice weekend guys.
WPRT or CLNE I'm hoping. Strong days both and closed near their daily highs. Need some help though, the whole Liquified Natural Gas thing for vehicles hasn't really caught on yet. These stocks been moving, but need a piece of news or something and they will be next the PLUG/FCEL
Bulls in shambles

u/SolitaryEgg in Lambos
I hope flexing a poli sci degree was in jest
I made like $20
I wanted to buy AYRO puts at open bc wtf. But I’m glad I forgot.
My dollary doo was up 15% Might have gained a few dollars. Woo hoo DP tonight!
I got absolutely fucked today (apart from my CRSR shares). I need a meme stock to recover holy fuck
Ended the day $210 gain. Hopefully we wake up to a million dollars Monday.
Hahahaha!
BEAR TRAP! Watch out 🌈🐻
Anyone feel like cnbc notifications have been absolute useless garbage for awhile? And late?
Good luck chump
# I DECLARE CHAPTER 7 13 AND 12
absolutely ridiculous, this post market sell off. Bet many 0DTE put sellers will get hit
[removed]
Gap up Monday right 🤣
Fuck you Tim Apple. :(
Did you lose on the principal or just the gains?

I went from $140k to 280k, then back down to 190k. Felt really bad but I was happy that I still had some house money to play with.

Took a break and now kind of hitting a wall around $220k and now I am missing entries because I lost all my confidence.

IDK, just take some time to watch the market. Re-balance your portfolio if you have open positions and average down when you get the chance, as long as the stock fundamentals still support it.

I wish I would have averaged down on FSLY. I basically bought at $75, rode it all the way to $130 then back down to $65. I wanted to average down but was basically paralyzed in fear and didn't. So I sold at $78 and am still pretty fucking salty how it pushed right past support/resistance at $78 like it was nothing. Shit was gapping down 10% a day.....
Spy hurt me :(
This dump is so fake and so cute mainly to make your calls expire worthless
This is the way
As expected eh?
The original SE. my mom won’t let me upgrade until I prove my worth in the family
Alexa, play xfiles theme song
Basically, constantly trying to time 0dte trades, selling things i planned to hold for a while at a loss, just emotional trading trying to chase all time high.
My friend tried BYND and said it tasted like absolute shyt.

Inverse that so BYND calls.
shit keeps drilling wtf
Is it Monday yet
Is there any vaccine news to pump spy?

Trulieve, Green Thumb, Cresco, etc. I'd list the tickers, but I'm not sure if autof4g deletes OTC shit.

APHA is one of my bigger positions at $5, but I'm predicting that the US companies will react more to 2021 changes in legislation.
I assume nobody made money today?

Another salty downvote fairy bot
Or rope
When you have seen day change -$23k - day change -$1500 is a win.
Yep pretty much. That’s why I love total market drones who say every time it’s the same. In no way can we truly know EV’s value because it’s being discounted further out than any sector pretty much. But at some point there will be clearer understanding and I’m not sold on the EV bulls who think we’re at reasonable levels right now.
This is going to be a wild weekend news cycle. Hang out to your asses, whatever your positions are. Godspeed.

SPY dropping while IWM near the high of the day. Makes sense. Small caps love shut downs.
That was literally so amazing
Not greeeeat

thank god I have PLTR shares, would not have been able to stomach that if I had calls
I was thinking gred
ciic
Dang it dumped so hard just like magic man said it would
Dm me a screenshot. I don’t believe you.
Me thinks we need another 30% correction :)
Another ATH close for NIO!
Over leveraged in calls headed into the weekend 😎

Not yet, i was avoiding it since 🥭 kept pumping it
RH says previous close was .01
Whats the new meme stock for next week?
No. That is exactly what going to happen to this stupid bitch. Thing is gunna open huge Monday.

Fcking week.. next OPEX I should just sit on my hands and watch other people fuck over each other

There’s simply no alternative to their products

Ok 100m isn't as likely as I thought.  It is possible the stock runs to 250 in perfect conditions, but I agree that its not particularly likely.  20-30 million is likely though in the event of a vote triggered short squeeze

I might have lost $976 today..... but it wasn’t $1,000 😎
Are you asking seriously ? It´s less than 0,1%
Lucky bastard, let’s do it again next week until it doesn’t work and you get banned
Honestly PLTR seems extremely undervalued.
[removed]
What strike prices?
Oh great, this is TikTok now?
Haha it’s on sale today. $45 12/24c
That was intense. I pissed myself
that end of day dump hurt
Like a cultist. Its funny because only lefties loved tesla.
ToS keeps screwing up my spread values at close. Like by several hundred dollars. Weird
Penises down have a good weekend autists see you Monday
Holding puts
If you’re using RH, no.
Well that fuckin sucked
Well these EOD TSLA spreads either a great idea or $150 down the drain lol.
God what a shitty day that was
The market was red yet stonks still seem to only go up
crayons down...back to work
Thank god its over

Vaginas down
Just bought the TSLA dip, 600 strike for new years eve. Dun goofed?
Webull has better fills than RH. I used both plus a tda  account. Downside of webull is lack of spreads. The interface is actually pretty good but its probbaly just information overload if ya dont know what your looking at.
And I did
I hope MM’s got fucked on 356 spy puts seeing how hard they were trying to pump it to keep it above water
fucking ruthless lol
thank god it's over

Thank you for the donation.
What stock to hold over weekend hmm
100 IQ is not impressive. Wait... for this sub it probably is.
Bulls talking all this shit this morning damm
If market cap mattered tsla would have never gotten to where it is and added on the s&p . Reality is a stocks as worth as much as someone is willing to pay.

Well that was certainly a day
Can you stop automatic selling of options? Like holy shit it’s ITM I bought it let me fucking sell it when tf I want to sell it not take half my gains I would’ve gotten away
I forgot to sell !! Nooo
How did you know NIO was going to be this big, or even the right call that early on? Im struggling with FOMO so i invest in a more diversified portfolio

RING THE BELL
PLTR whale putting a 30k sell wall at 18.13 - 18.15 for the close here it was never going to moon here EOD with that in the way... moon mission confirmed for Monday.
[deleted]
This is normal for Friday we rallied all week
Yes.
Also, if one is approved for level 2+ options: I believe it is also considered a covered call if I own the same strike price on a later date, and/or a lower strike (for a call, a put would need to be higher). However, it could also be called opening a spread, but it is in essence a covered call.
CLOSE THE MARKET CLOSE IT NOW
hey, have you tried REGN?
Calls and puts
Nobody tell him.
I got into that late bull trap, 14 mins til EOD and still paper hand 🤡🤡🤡

Share recall for a major board vote would result essentially in like, 60+ million shorts having to cover (meaning buying shares) in a very short period of time.  And by having to cover, I mean their broker tries to close the position out for them without their consent.

Yessir
Alcohol and weed
14.7k, starting with 2.5k. lost most of it while rh was down, then back up to 12.9k and right back down to a margin call. Added 2k more to get out of margin. 

Put the game down for a few months after that one lol.
Tanking the market for Thanksgiving so everyone gets depressed and doesn't travel, thereby stopping the spread of covid. 100 IQ play😎
NVDA too low imo
u aint chinese
MA is one of my favorite stocks nobody mentions. It either tanks or moons, no in between.
Is PLTR dead for a bit?
Agree
Hell yeah finally dumped TSLA without having to take a loss.

Baba and go a lil longer trust

Keep looking at ELY guys.  It's starting its earnings runup.  Great narrative with Golf exploding in popularity during lockdowns.
And if monday is red too?
Highly unlikely. We'll see.

I bought some PTON at $100 and sold BABA puts at $260 I didn't really think they would moon this week but I am always wrong so just inverse me
TLT steadily rising all day long. Yeehaw!

Yes

Also thought id mention Vail did a bunch of lobbying and speaking with government officials recently to keep resorts open.  I agree that if they close its GG, but I wouldn't bet on them closing.

sold dkng at 48. bought pltr at ipo after that. pltr went down to 9 but is now 18
I convinced my (very scary) future father in law to buy GME, and my boss.  Currently have 1/3rd of my account in GME calls, and 1/3rd in shares.  Deep margin.  I'm about as sure on this as one can be.  But it could take awhile to kick off still, no way to tell.  When it runs, it just runs
Tesla went up $100 in two days

I too have seen this since 2018. But its so hard to see when the buuble will pop. Can you provide more input on when this shit bubble might finally burst?
That's kinda what i think too...
Thank you, hopefully its under 5B in terms of valuation

Also, it’s a bit of mix. It’s bubble for those who don’t have have production right now like Nikola. It’s not bubble for companies that actually have production like TSLA, NIO, XPEV, and LI.

How the fuck is AMC still up?? Jesus
I was promised moon by christmas so I am still holding strong

Legit tickers like MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, NVDA, AMD etc are red.

Monday gonna be green as greenery.
CRSR doing work
Yeah I think it is to protect people who have calls but can’t afford 100 shares but it shouldn’t just be preset for everyone without no opt-out
I hope not either, elsewise we'll be fucked by over priced premiums like on snow/unity. We'll see though. Any ideas on when it comes out?
Duuude...patience. The game is about patience.

I dont know and to be honest I dont think anyone on here knows either. The issue from what I understand though isn't in computational power, but it may be in pur current understanding. But I dont know why if it is a current understanding why that means we will understand it one day. I think that is very arrogant to assume. There are issues that we can't solve due to a lack of understanding and despite allocating time and resources to studying it we still have not actually understood what it is we set put for. Gravity could be an example.
softbank going in on baba
Probably
Yeah, probably
my shit in shambles rn
PLTR
It makes sense though because governments keep coming out and saying by 2030 combustible vehicles won’t be allowed. Everyone’s trying to hedge that sector by buying everything up irrespective of the asset has any intrinsic value.
Just went all in holding calls until Monday. NVDA PLTR DKNG now at the dip, GMHI MU, CRM VRTS BABA and FSR. 70% sitting in weekly and leaps
NIO to play catch-up next week? 60 EoW

I looked at them this morning. I would not buy anything right now until they finish dilution. Looks like they're trying to buy the other 49% of their TELOS ID company, pay off some debt and I don't quite understand if they're trying to retire their preferred stock yet.

Anyone know where I can see yesterday’s open interest on the 01/21 baba 250 puts?

There was a $3+ million block trade yesterday afternoon and I wanted to see if it was a close out of a put or a reopen. If open interest declined, then I’d say someone closed out their puts (which would be super bullish)
agreed

Edit: wait wtf, I was looking at a wrong company, this stuff is legit. I think it's a good play when you go for leaps. Honestly, kinda surprised it's trading so cheap, might do some dd on it soon
Come Monday you won’t regret it. I’d buy May 2021 calls to be safe. $70 strike IMO

Why does that mean the growth will continue? This is a logical fallacy. There isn't an actual physical force on nature guiding this growth and assuming it will continue because it has in the past is wrong

I was actually thinking the same for NIO which I own. I’m hoping IV tanks at a stretched plateau so I can pick up cheap OTM puts. Right now it’s the most expensive option in town though. Either way I have the same thinking. EV is riding its own coattails to a certain degree.

Excited cycle noises
Anyone here thinking NVDA calls? 🤔🤔🤔
Okay why not
Yeah man you’re gonna make bank
If y'all aren't buying OTC US weedstock tickers, you're missing out.

Pull your Canadian LP charts back to the Trudeau win and the 2018 fed legalization rally.

Didn’t even have to attribute the quote, who else is that out of touch.
BABA calls for monday
This is the way..
I did it!
somehow feel this isnt the final act
Because even if you had the knowledge and proper execution, getting the materials and analogues in any significant quantity is a huge red flag and guaranteed prison time. Not too convenient.

11/27 18c, 12/18 17c, 1/15 15c + 50 shares @ 16.50.

Yeah definitely the play
"The sell order you are about to place includes shares that are not yet settled (paid for). Please be aware that if the funds used to purchase these shares are not settled, this sale may result in a Good Faith Violation."
Third friday of the month, gotta slap them call holders down.

Keep going, PTON!

Because they’re somewhat the competition and also an analog. He’s comparing conversely, you’re reading it wrong.
I got jan 80c on AZN, waiting for the pop
Don’t forget BABA
IWM going nuts
bull trap
You’re right but Market cap 18.8b. I don’t see it being worth more than double that. 

How about Fubo. 1.5b fast growing sports streaming service/package that just announced they’re going to be doing betting. I agree with you that it’s going to be an absolute cash cow once sports are back online in full but it’s less priced in here IMO
The dump and pump? Classy
I am engorged right now
Positions ranked by what I believe is most likely to least likely to peint: 

NUAN 12/18 45c

MGNI 12/18 17.5c

FCX 12/11 26.5C

CLF 12/4 10.5c

Yeah , stop being a lil bitch and up

DOUBLED DOWN BOUGHT 10 MORE 360 SPY CALLS FOR MONDAY
The Fitbit chart is so funny.  At first glance it looks like huge movements and it's really only 2-3 cents at most
Trading control of the company apparently 😕
I’ll admit it, I’m a fucking communist.

BABA 287.5c 12/11
Let's see where it finishes, please
Well I messaged the mods about banning me early since I did  a ban bet. Still no ban..... Am I ban proof?
[deleted]
Post positions
selling?
We could actually end green today
why??
on what, spy?
Yes. Look at the volume of most options; they usually exceed the open interest by a fair amount. Ex: Timmy Theta wrote an option and sold it for $1 premium ($100 total paid). Arthur Autist bought it for $1.05 (the ask price, so the brokerage got paid the .05 difference). The stock decreases in price, causing the call option to decrease to $.90. Arthur Autist has paper hands and immediately sells. The stock goes back up and the option has an ask price of $1.00, where you bought it. The brokerage/market maker made money on the spread each time. This is an extremely simplistic example, most option writers don’t write an option so close to being in the money. But it explains the concept.
360c are only .01c
💎🤲🌌🧠
Any stonks I can buy going into an AH pump? Maybe XPEV?
If I sell, is it a guaranteed violation?

Do yourself a favor and get into xpev and Li right now. They're going parabolic over the weekend
You can use voip to call, it's easy to record in your computer.
God damn TSLA is going way down before it comes back up huh?  Guess I should set a stop loss on these 12/11 500$ calls for next week like a pussy
so damn fake.
Where do we see NVDA end of next week?

That’s what I like to hear

I was just about to say this. You think it will get enough hype by that time?
Thank goodness I was worried!!! World peace achievement unlocked
U, BABA, GO, EPRT, SNX, SNOW
I'd recommend the 11/27 $22 C. That's the one I'm going to sell a cover call on.
🌌🧠 Leaps are free money imo. Just time entry to maximize tendies.
Sounds about right. Their pricing structure makes SAP look cheap.
AYRO
SPY
Congrats! That’s awesome.  How do you feel about BABA long term?
thx. I had an inkling it was to do with the volume of contracts 👍
Fuck these fucking bounces. Just crash
Because I'm actually a profitable trader and you retards actively push away anyone trying to help you
Just put $500 in Robinhood but will come next Friday. Hopefully I'll be good to buy then. Made over $90 in 2 days of starting with CRSR so not bad start
yes
How is nobody talking about telos (TLS)? This shit is the next PLTR ezpz
You get 3 of those before the ban you from trading before funds settle for 90 days

PLTR blasts the fuck off for a whole WEEK, has one red day and all of a sudden it’s a shit stock. I’ve never been so sure that this sub is full of retards
inversed. buying more calls.
20+ have faith my child
Puts next week
Bet how do you record a phone call
spoken like a true autist. good luck!
then can you tell me what a FCV is? seems like those would be complementary to EVs, no? i'm not saying they manufacture vehicles themselves but the tech is involved

my real point was that i was agreeing with lulubutts companies that have jumps in stock prices tend to have more offerings and dilute shares
Yeah but that was unemployment pay, if you were still working you got jack shit
What weekend swing play y’all got I just bombed an exam and tendies would brighten my day
I'm holding ZM calls over the weekend
Thank you for your donation.
What’s the next meme stock
Telling wsb autists to not FD something is impossible so go for it. Sounds like a great idea as usual. 

I hold EOY $17 calls and Feb '21 $20 calls and a few hundred shares at $14. I'm not a complete retard, yet. 

FD is life for some.
I wanna make at least a 30% return on every trade but have 0 risk tolerance. Any ideas for me?

I’m not sure about PTON, it’s a low entry for competitors....if a competitor got a trending fitness star...then it would be devastating to PTON

I’m long for home fitness, but not PTON in particular with the run up it has.
AIM
Not happening bro! :/
How man what were your plays
the more I put in, the more likely I am to get fucked
TTNP up 72% this week.😅

yes, im aware im likely retarded
Up again then big down

tsla
Ark trading anything today??
Most analysts say long term anything under 300 is a steal.... we’ve seen it at 300 in recent weeks and i firmly believe the drop beginning of month was an overreaction. 

This is what I’ve been telling myself tho so tread with caution.
200k volume on GE calls today. Get in autists

THIS IS THE WAY
Do winners do drugs even? By definition I didn’t  think so so I didn’t bring it up lol

i'm all green today mlemlemlmelm
I thought the same but looking at BLNK pumping over 20% 3 consecutive days I say FCEL is ready to move up more. The $5 area building good support
Catch covid
-0.35% is an overreaction to an end to QE and the president going to war with big pharma?

well, ok bro
$70 bet - guaranteed 100% payout

Multiple Thousand $ bet - guaranteed -96% payout

Choose wisely
Asana pumping last minute
NIO $69 EOD. Bet

I laughed way too hard at this during my zoom call
Sell Fastly now !!
TGT + SNAP calls. Enjoy
Please don’t hurt yourself. No new good news till early Dec. (vaccine approval) only heaps and heaps of bad news. Wait till Black Friday super spreader event freak out.

If there's going to be a real market wide drilling session then AAPL needs to close lower than 117.
Yeah it is. You holdin out on me bro!?!?!

Bought 100 SPY $360c for Monday
everything recovering except tech
Estrogen and soy levels are so damn here... why??
bundle the buy, dip of sticks
NVDA 580c weekly for $0.58 looks good
Looking at the charts right now!!
So I guess Zoom and Pton are now back in the game?
Yes. Havent grabbed more, my avg price is just under 16. If by some miracle it drops to 16 or less I will.
Just got baba my dude
Got a SPY put for $4 and now it’s worth $4.50 :) on my way to wEaLth
Everything sucks today
The only catalyst would be bad news. Rona lockdowns were almost always announced over the weekend earlier this year. If enough states say something, expect red, otherwise I think that next week may literally be identical to this one. Big green monday, slides down all week, expect this ecspeically if there is more vaccine news.
lmao, got his ass
Lost money 3 different ways on PLTR today, need a breather
[removed]
Analyst upgrade apparently
Oh shit am I fuc?
Might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen on this Sub
im with you, chief. baby weight but 10x 6.5c 11/27
i’m deciding to wait because a call right before the market closes on a meme stock is how i lost $300 in the first place. i intend to make it back this week.
Yes, maybe.
Market will rise Monday hopefully I’ll get my money back
how many of you tards took positions on GMHI?
SPY $370 C 12/18
Time to buy into a play that will surely be up 100% on monday, but only put in $70 because I'm a pussy
On this note, I just want to congratulate all the SOLO retards this week. Bravo mother fuckers. Bravo.
Ante up my doods. PLTR bottomed.
# BULLISH CLOSE
It's holding up brilliantly in this range, still has more upwards room I hope
PLTR goes without saying
really eyeing some 11/27 AMZN calls... 3100c?
Why roku ?
Baba so bullish going into next week
Hence the wish me luck. I believe in elon.
If I had bezos money I would already be dead
BJ beat earnings, oversold, bought some shares for the weekend
idk FCEL is giga overbought right now. You think it still has room to run before a pullback?
Lmao. Dan Pena energy.

Music videos in general have very low standards but this is one of the stupidest things I have ever seen in a music video.
Who they looking to merge with
The feeling when your positions are already set for next week, cuz you ain’t a bitch and afraid to hold. 😚
Yep, hulk dicks will be back to erase bears AGAIN next week
If you're holding tesla calls over the weekend... I wish you good fortune my shieldbrothers
I already commented on some comments in here but feel the need to address the links you posted. Only one of your three articles even mentions FCEL as being a part of their strategy. That article is over a year old and has not borne any fruit when it comes to profits for FCEL. The others speak to hydrogen fuel cells being used in vehicles but have no mention of FCEL being a part of that plan. FCEL isn't even moving towards being involved with fuel cell production for vehicles because everything they have done up to this point is either standalone power plants or integrating solutions with those plants.

I think FCEL is a total pump and dump based entirely on the name and vague relation to the actual hotness of hydrogen powered vehicles. 

Ultimately, I hope this trade works out for you and anyone who chooses to play it. I say puts or just stay away entirely.
mooning hard next week
Is a January 15 $315c for BABA a good bet?
Joe Biden was the first to push for universal tax rate of 12% in 2008.
Taking profits is a hard lesson to learn. Instead of chasing tsla higher, I could've easily flipped that 20k into 60 or 80 in pton. Fuckin hell. Gl.
It lost $40 the week before, that’s TSLA
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW shaped recovery
Of course
Great last 3 min!! 17 to go, let’s erase the dump

u gay?
Dunkin received its buyout price. Delta goes to 0. Cash out.
Expiration?
MY DD ON DRAFTKINGS, TICKER SYMBOL DKNG:

Take a step back from your phone. Think about what’s happening. Sports are back on TV. People are stuck inside. The upper and upper-middle class has a lot of extra money right now from not traveling and not going out to eat. Online gambling just got legalized in Michigan and Virginia. As someone who has friends in the wealthy suburbs of each state, I can tell you DKNG is about to get flooded with cash come January once the states new measures take effect. DRAFTKINGS is the most well known online betting website, and that’s was even before the current news regaurding legal betting. 
More stimulus money is coming in, which equals more gambling money. Think about all the degenerates who aren’t able to go gamble at the casino or in Vegas right now. They’re gonna go to DKNG. 
Another analyst raised his price target to $100 this past Tuesday, with it currently sitting at $48. Its an easy options play. I see this at $90 by end of March easily.
Tbh I kinda wanna move to north korea
yeah 275x at 18.67
right before black friday and christmas? do it
You're a lot less fucked than you were last week. 🤷‍♂️
Fuck it, I’m in
So how exactly will Cohen trigger the short squeeze?
CRSR killing my account rn this dip is massive

Mmm okay I’m kidding they’ve been holding up my entire portfolio this past week :)
I felt that
will pltr be up next week? (there’s only one right answer)
Lol....don't be toasted
depends on when you bought it, but should be okay
it gained almost 100 dollars this week

This is the motherfucking way
actually it's not
yea lol
Only 20 mins left. What to buy??
If there is anything I learned these past 2 months it is to buy every dip
do I hold baba calls over the weekend?
$AMBA earnings next week get in while u can
load up calls for next week
I'm balls deep in a 17.50/20 Jun21 call spread, 1.50 debit to make $1.  Only risk is if the acquisition is consummated by then and it's a dog everyone wants to get out of, but I see $20 NAV as a floor.
AAPL 11/27 @ 120c. It's so cheap. Seems like an obvious play
I just helped your cause......however little it is.
Wish i cashed earlier
NIO you fucking piece of shit
This market is totally legal and totally cool.
Just as long as it doesn’t go up to 494 and back to 490 in the next 20 minutes I’ll be happy
With the S&P inclusion on the horizon it‘s too damn risky, maybe even stupid, to play weeklies. BUT...to each their own.
;^)
OP is retarded, the bad kind, and doesn't understand exchange rates. You're buying in at $1.02 usd which is $1.34 CAD. That offer of $1.10 is in CAD
No
it's down less than 1% on the day
What
Let's hope you're correct lol. I hold PLTR leaps, but I like arguing against my holdings to keep myself honest.
ok, im holding my baba calls 12/18 300c
This is why you don't use robinhood. You could've bought 11/20 calls today and lost money faster.
u buying AT 3:55? I want proof

Warning: ads in this site are nsfw
Yup fuck it
who are the "smart people"
I don't agree with that
I couldn't agree more, but I'm pretty confused about what the trend is right now. I was saying it was clearly green early this week, but now we're about to have 3 of 5 red days...so is the Sept/Oct bearishness really continuing?
Taking profits from NIO XPENG and PLUG into FCEL
I haven’t bought the call yet, i’m speculating on a potential play before the market closes. i’m most likely gonna wait to see how things play out Monday morning before since it’s now at 18.27.

Can i ask, why’s this such an autistic move in your eyes? It’s got support behind it, what’re you reasons for being a gay bear?
Thoughts for zoom over the weekend?
if u don’t BUY NVIDIA U ARE FUCKEN STUPID !!!!!!

On SPY, yes
Cash and flip or hold to close, always such a tough call
Cuz they don't got that executive functioning working
Joe Biden signed the equal rights act in the 90s
I had been thinking about getting back into PTON and seeing you put a mil in convinced me, thanks for the help getting tendies! I don't have a mil or even 50k total but it was still nice
For sure.

TESLA isn’t going back down below 3 digits guaranteed and i dont see charging stations being hampered for long either. My only long term strategy on EV’s right now is BLNK since i lack the capital to meaningfully invest in TSLA(would require me to drain my savings to get anything menaingful out of it which im not comfortable doing since i want to retire some day).

We’ll just have to wait and see how this plays out for everyone else.
One week...that’s a big bet.
This last dump is gonna be ugly 😫
12/4 23c baby. RIDE THE LIGHTING
So your saying a guy already had the calls and just needed to get rid of them
Why....
CIIC to the mofo MOOON
Should I go all in and buy $1.1m+ worth of GME shares?
Nobody tell him.
i guess its the same reason i dont make my own bar soap

Why did i even buy fb. This shit is the literal epitome of stairs up, jump off a fucking building down
Come on, 20 min, pump it up ....let’s teach the last game dumpers a lesson!!
Yes
Spy on cockroach mode. You keep stomping but the shit keeps getting back up
Bears trying very hard to pull down TSLA, why are people selling a month before SPY inclusion
How did it not dump after it was discovered the new "rumour" was just a month old article.....

I'm a fucking newbie who bought at around $37 yesterday morning for $1K and so far made near $90 so far. It's near $40 so maybe you're still good to go because I heard this one has lots of promise.
Careful of bull trap
If this his true, bears better watch smithfield - Chinese company bought them up a few years ago so they could export easier and learn about raising pigs I guess. Probably one reason for a shortage of pork.

Yes
Get a real bike so you can explore the world
Went from 77k to 8k myself brother. You still have dough, you could turn 3.5k back into 11k in a week or even a day with the right meme ticker. At least don’t kill yourself until it’s all gone imagine the potential gains you’ll miss 🔫
$355 is the floor.
Crack is a wonderful drug
Why should they?
Cramer tells retailers to buy the dip every time. He once tweeted seven times in all caps how we hit a bottom in February. We were down less than 10% and he was telling people to buy.
Instructions not clear, bought SPY call Tuesday and got fucked. It's time for the nuclear option, I'm going full Randy from South Park.

Why aren’t 3D printing companies mooning ?

Anyone else holding PLTR shares and calls over the weekend?
Yes
they're going to be essential when they roll out a system similar to gynas social credit for when you're a bad goy. you'll want to own a piece of the system that oppresses you.
u could be set for a time if u buy 12/18 calls any strike, leaps
you know it
Wow lmao that's incredible. I think it's gonna dump. Rootin for ya

How many driveways do they need to pave to justify that valuation?
But fuel cell doesn’t even cater for that? It’s literally a big ass power supply that can power local infrastructure. There’s nothing innovative or exciting about this tech. But you do you
That’s actually more than 50%, good job retard!!
So, who else dumped their PLTR at a >90% loss? 🙋🏻‍♂️
Somebody says this shit everyday
Explanation: Don't fight the trend.
people are sleeping on this one man.
i've beeni nthis trade and am all over the place. look at URBN after earnings t he last  few eyears, also spikes. i real safe play is a spread, but this is wsb so yolo

Whats going on here? How do I lose my money?
Scam market.
EV week lol even NKLA got a run up
If you have calls (like myself) this is bad because the value went down. 

But I’m excited by the volume and expect more volatility in the coming week, hopefully in the other direction!
Entered a yolo position in a blank check company FTIV
This is the DD I'm here for

thank you for your contribution
I bought and iv drop already fucking me lmao. I really hope they dump after hours
Stop buying the dip, retards. Don’t you want Lower equity prices like March? Fuck...
And up it goes again
Oil pumping into close too
>Dec 18th 40c

What exactly does this mean?

For sure I'll keep that in mind. I started investing for the first time yesterday on CRSR $1K (my only stock) and I made around $85-$90 so far these last 2 days which is not bad to start with. The highest would have been $115 but hey these 2 days any number over $80 I'm content with haha

The autist giving out BJs behind the liquor store so he can buy more FDs said mostly likely 23-25
I concur.
This
Ya it's not haha long TSLA. I just called my mom to verify. Their plan was to sell at $200. They didn't.
damn fucking straight
Why don’t you guys just buy normal, longer dated calls? Why do you insist on making the most money in the shortest period of time, or losing your entire investment? Why can’t you just not be autistic?
Nikola is still worth $10 billion.
I hope so but it seems like whenever one of these citron articles come out it’s almost an immediate dump. Plus iv is dropping on my puts and fucking me already.
thanks a lot donald biden
So NKLA puts right?
Can anyone win, if they have not first lost everything?
I don't know about short-term, but man, the business model is cash.
Same thing that’s been happening with a lot of the recent tech. ER good = stock dump
I just know if I don't hold anyone over the weekend we mooning 15 points again.

Add JD and AYRO to the list
IWM is so strong
cheers, lost all my money
Weekly 360c/365c still fairly cheap actually. Did we get FDA emergency approval for Pfizer and Moderna yet?
yessir. dumb question: can you explain what's the significance of the 3rd week of the month? like options expire all the time
Smart, buy the dip
WHAT STUPID FUCK IS NOT BUYING THE NVIDIA DIP!!!!
BABA's chart looked good so I jumped in today when it was 2 points up.  So far so good.  Got some 275c for 12/18.  Already up about 30%.
And the day passed just like that

SPY pump failed

PLTR shills starting to wet their pants

In other words, nothing new

Have a good weekend

Wear a mask because fucking mandate coming, get used to it

XPEV 75, NIO 80, TSLA 800.... and you're up 2400% total. This is the essence of this sub
big money buying calls
HOLY FUCK SPY  WOWWWW WATCHING MY PORTFOLIO SWINGING 10'S OF DOLLARS IN MERE MINUTES GOD I LOVE STONKS
Trump and Wall Street trying to create a scary sell-off situation. Retailers watching everything not understanding why everything went down and buys the dip. Cramer confused why retailers keep buying.
Warrants here are basically long dated options (5 years) with a strike price of $11.50. So essentially every dollar the shares go above $11.50 you are in the money by $1 more. Type of leverage just like options that can result in exponential returns. Riskier than shares though because warrants can go to zero if the SPAC dissolves, just like options.

!RemindMe 6 months if I regret this (probably not)
My account is down $30k (over 50%) from Amazon calls, don't beat yourself up. Take a step back, maybe even a few weeks off, come back with a clean mind.

You can make it back. Just don't dump large portions of your portfolio into single plays, that's a mistake.

I was up 19k yesterday on my 500c, 1000%. I sold today for 650. Get on my retarded level 😭😭😭
Picked up cheap VXX calls earlier this week that expire next week, feeling pretty good about hanging onto them over the weekend
Bromley?
Fraud market
Exactly. Institutional investors can't sit on cash, they just can't. 1) Inflation eats away at your capital and 2) No one is going to give you money if you're just going to sit on it.

So they have to deploy that capital somewhere. If interest rates are at zero, the only option is equities.
Dump volume on SPY 80K

Pump volume 15K
Calls for Monday or puts? All vaccine news is in. So the market has no reason to gap-up.
Late december $25
I agree

Edit: but I do think you’ll see some winners keep their valuations relatively high, unlike the false pop of weed stocks a few years ago
pinned = mod needs liquidity
Why buy puts or calls and not just play futures?  Futures is made perfectly for this strategy.

Options is gambling for the poors but investing for the whales.
I just buy/sell options while I’m at work. I can buy an option in 20 seconds on Robinhood. Webull gives you 5 selection types to choose from before you can move forward to a separate screen to purchase an options. I just appreciate Robinhood a user interface far more than webulls
“Debit spreads minus the long leg lmao” 

lmfaooo

Lol godlike advice
Eeesh, DonDon's going to be pissed that Cuomo is getting an Emmy.
Throw into some cash weeklies.
lol
Hope you're right, we got 30 minutes for it to shoot up 50% lol
God damn it, I'm in.
Oh absolutely not i think EV’s are in a bubble right now which is why i say if you’re buying in now play on the short term, long term after it bursts. 

I think TESLA’s valuation *will* eventually hit that mark again after the bubble bursts but these EV gains are just too insane to not be a bubble.
Load up on Hormel and Dick’s at EOD. Two kinds of meats to hold you over the weekend.
I sold this morning. Gut feeling telling me it’s gonna drop some more. Yeah US govt contracts and Biden administration are both very good for PLTR but govt contracts aren’t even half their business. Also for a company that’s been around for 17 years, doubling their mkt cap in basically a week is just hype rn. I’ll buy in again if it drops below $16. 

This is a retirement stock, not something to be playing weekly FDs with IMO, but good luck.
Yeah I’m going all in for sure, hopefully they have options early on I’ll buy a ton of way otm weeklies

$SPY below the 5 day moving average, buy calls
I thought it was because I bought calls
Shilling/meme-ing aside, where do you guys see PLTR in late Dec/Jan?

Is it all hype or is there actual value there?
the trend is your friend
JUST BOUGHT 530$ NVIDA CALLS !!!!! 

They beat earnings 

Bro gtfo 😡 with this DIP
Is there a term for strategies consisting of buying deep OTM calls as a bet on volatility increasing, so you print through Vega, with no real belief the underlying will reach the strike?
Imagine not playing PLUG. Red day? Never heard of her.
☝️
If you compare computer and what they are able to do now compared to only 10 years ago you would realize how fast it is accelerating. With neural networks and exponential growth there is nothing that indicates that progress would abruptly stop. There are already things that computers and AI is a lot “smarter” at depending on how you define smart. Fucking boomer!
Vaccine talks going well
Scarlet fu and riktia gupta
😍🥰
Guess ill buy puts then.
I'd taken out £90 for a hooker but put it back in to PLTR to buy the dip hopefully I can buy a better hooker come December

Down 2% today on my long shares - had some good scalps during the day - Roku, Sonos, Twitter.  Closed out the last, time to get drunk.  Don’t want to talk about my options plays until I am drunk.
I feel like Clark Kent when the market falls after I sold my puts. I need to change into my SuperBear uniform
What makes you say that?
Maybe GME
Ok red Friday, you know what it means.. green hulk dick MONDAY 🔫

CRSR, FDX, TWTR, NET, SBE

All calls. I think im pretty well dIvErSiFiEd

at the end of the day it's just money. you feel like shit now but you realise later on it's not that big of a deal. try not to get too tunnel visioned on it and focus on ways to bouncing back. gl bro and don't go long on $ROPE
So , do you think that's a gap in our current understanding , computational power , etc that we will get over in time ( AI winter -> Deep Learning ) or is it a gap we will never bridge because the brain can't be represented in silicon or has something more than just physical matter and connections?

Don’t defy the soon to be retard god
is anybody here a 🌈🐻??
It keeps on dipping ffs🤡
Vix is coming up, looks like that was a bull trap
Honestly, I’ve never been so pissed about a dump. My plays pumped all day and now this? Just from the Trump conference? Ridiculous
I bought like 700 shares yesterday around $18.30 ish and sold covered calls for today for 18.5 and 19. I regretted doing it tho bc I sacrificed long term growth for short term premiums, but now I get to keep my shares and roll them over for the next week. Gonna wait for a Green Day next week and sell 22 or 23 calls.
youre a mad lad i remember you. Props for holding those contracts through july-october fire victim trust fuckery
Okay you are right there
I could have let go of these bags and be free. No penalty. Nope. Decided to hold. 🤡🤡🤡
Fair enough. One of my worst spacs is up 7 percent for some reason.

50% break even on CCL 2023 only sounds big until you realize that would still be a fraction of pre Covid prices, this is basically free money

Anyone thinking NVDA calls here?

Understandable... Nonstop positive articles today and got a target price increase today as well. Guess I'm just hoping the attraction to EV everywhere makes it run up quick before a sell off at 48-55

Alibaba calls for Monday??
I bought 11/27’s on the first dip at $490 and have just been having to average down all after noon
$17 nov 2021 leap. How retarded am I?
TSLA is going to make it but idk if it’s valuation stays where it is. It is just absolutely insane. Although, they may complete the transition to an energy/infrastructure company which they’re well on their way to doing. Even so though.
trend is my friend, and we are trending downward.
Perhaps a prediction of what’s to come next week.
Completely. I’m going to buy some puts when the energy efficiency sector starts to drag

Just bought spy calls, RIP spy call holders 😞
They won’t let me buy stock or options at all. My accounts in jail for 3 months. Robinhood a user interface is far superior than any other app. I don’t need graphs and tons of numbers, and I definitely don’t need to have every single button crammed onto one screen. Webull is literal garbage. If they changed their UI to match Robinhood. I would have no problem. I despise the scrolling feature to look for option prices on webull. Robinhood is simple. I’ve gotta get Robinhood back.
Volume is showing a pump....is it going to pull off a surge?
$WORK, any strike around high 20s and low 30s, earnings on 12/9.

You know you just got lucky gambling right?
The last bubble pop took 15 years to recover from. The next one might take 50. Make sure to cash out at the peak of this bubble, as you won't have another lifetime to recover from it this time.
so your exiting because of the lockdown and you think the market will crash?
IWM has absolute retard strength and it’s driving me nuts
Is the real dump coming now?
Good advice

[removed]
Thank you so much
I made the point about it being an old company but what support has the alternative energy sector had since 1992 in comparison to now. EV is great undoubtedly but it can't solution everything and not everything is going to be battery technology overnight. I think the more industrial sector, i'm talking trains/ships might go a different route before battery
Wow that dump is actually being eaten back up by the cumslut bulls
I didn't lose 50%, but I needed this today. Ordering pizza asap. Thank you.
because of ant ipo though. current levels have dropped to near pre ipo announcement levels. so its a question of how much was alibaba over/undersold in reaction to the ipo delay.
Major short squeeze may be coming on HYLN if you look at the short float
That would get you about 100 chicky nuggets.
Bought the NVDA dip hopefully this shit gaps up next week ffs
Gonna learn python and get a job at PLTR, wish me luck
i guess we will just drive our lambos without them.
I have PLTR infinityDTE shares. Should I sell?
I told you, it will be a boring day. There is no new catalyst.
dont know what $IIVI does but the illuminati ass name is enough to buy calls on
I'm not THAT retarded. Everywhere I look says the ticker is SHC and that's what I'm searching for in TOS and that's turning up zero.
If Exxon can sell it, sure. Otherwise, no.
[deleted]
A fuck ton of people have off all of next week because they have so much vacation time built up from not being able to travel this year that they need to use it before they lose it.  Tons of firms will probably have no one working next week. Gotta take profits now before holiday week.
For now

sell-off is delayed for some reason.
Smart man.
Buy as many reasonable pltr calls as you can for 1 month out and wait. Literally all you need to do my friend

Edit: don’t worry about the loss so much that’s a shitload of money to me so I feel you but it’s just numbers you’ll get back in time
Riot boring today
Me too but which response? Mine or op's?
Goin up to 12 next week
Seriously. It was slightly above 40 and now it's not smh
Understand you put yourself in a position where this was a possibility. Maybe don’t go into Friday with 80% of your money in rapidly decaying derivatives. Cuz this can happen if you do that...as you now know.

And don’t buy puts on shit just because you think it’s gone up too much or it’s a bubble or the PE or whatever. It’s a great way to get killed.
All sold out sorry, but may I interest you in some Tesla 550?
what are you buying?
Thank you so much for this and your other post in the thread. FCEL is merely gaining traction due to its name, not its actual prospects.

I’m actually happy PLTR had a slight correction today. I get to keep my covered calls and can be invested in the long term potential of the company.
Recount the market???
We are recovering
NVDA calls?
SNE at $90 heading into Black Friday week, love to see it.
Where did you read that they’re the only producer in the Western Hemisphere?
Anyone here thinking NVDA and AMZN calls? 🤔🤔🤔

Oh no im not saying only tesla is going to make it im saying tesla and charging stations is the only 99% for sure bet. 

I can see approx. 3-4 large players once this all plays out but the matter of figuring out who exactly that will be is a very high risk assessment.

Don’t have FOMO next week, buy DKNG right now during the long squeeze. DRAFTKINGS received a price target of $100 this past Tuesday. Currently sitting at $48, average price targets sitting over $70. Easy money. Buy May 2021 calls. Thank me later.

How do the warrants work? You basically are able to buy the shares at a lower price? I agree that this will likely hit, I did quite a bit of half-assed research and this seems like one of the more worthwhile and likely to happen spacs

Let's stop and think. Nothing has changed about the company to warrant a 10% pump in a day, we're talking about people's FOMO causing them to jump in (or some big fund deciding to buy in). Otherwise there is absolutely no reason to expect this pump. I think the FOMO has peaked, so I expect it to trade sideways for a while.
Up 23% on my 5 figure account today. Called the BABA bottom (leaps) & the SPY top (dec. puts). Feels damn good. 😎🎰💵
This worked for BABA because it was stuck in a slow downtrend for 10 days where the IV got killed.  
  
Now collecting:  
MSFT IV: 24%  
AAPL IV: 28%  
  
These two giants have been stagnant for so long that the IV has gotten fucked. 1 good green day and we shall be eating!

Not only is not sexy, it’s not efficient either...weather you are getting your hydrogen from electrolysis, or separating natural gas through distillation, you are wasting a comical amount of energy. With electrolysis, you might as well just put the electricity you are using to create H2, and put it into your battery pack in your car instead. we already have the infrastructure in place to have electricity flowing where we need it, when we need it through our societies, and houses. the infrastructure, and supply chains need to be built out for hydrogen from the ground up. everything needs to be designed, and then implemented on a HUGE scale. not to mention, you would never be able to refuel at home with a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. it literally doesn’t make sense to support hydrogen fuel cell technology, it was dead from the start. BEV are the definite winner, and we will see it play out through this decade.
So... ever watched brewster's millions?

There is no stimulus until next year and we the package is going to be small anyway, we all know that already.
Damn, $CRSR doing some edge play today with $40.
had to extract it from TOS option scanner
I got restricted for the stupidest shit lmao
Yes people buying the dip
Higher peaks means lower valleys. Godspeed you illiterate fuck
Bulls gonna get some quality fukt time
damn my friend sold his calls and bought puts at the same time he just made od 🏦
I bought some 20c leaps. Can’t wait for $100 end of 2021
Watch what? What do you think is gonna happen?
Real dump starts at 3:30
TSLA don’t worry about what SPY is doing, you’re your own stock. Go ahead and moon now it’s okay.
All of them
Me
Yup. And then I said “when it hits 40k I’ll cash out”. Next few days I was under 20k and so on
II hedged America with BABA pre election and then it took a dump
My money is manipulated.
To the retard who told me to buy GMHI.. thank you sir
whats the cheap lotto play for monday?
Sounds like you don't know what that means
My friend from the boundox kept talking about how much her family loves dg. Then i google mapped these fuckers (therere 3 apparently in like 5 miles of me) and theyre becoming the main grocer for small ass hick towns. They pray on food deserts and their margins are huge (small quantity sizes = high profit margin). Bought shares last week and i approve this dd
Most of us have been there bro. I blew a 40k account up twice. Buy longer dated options and dont fight trends, especially on meme stocks
This is so fucking true, even some older social-rejects play that shit
HK gonna pump baba so hard
It's only 30 cash covered puts of Amazon in a week.  Only need 9.3mm to cash cover it.  Half of that is margin so I believe it.... Theta Gang it is.
CRSR a meme stonk? Get a grip man.
Calls on sale
Anyone holding BABA over weekend?
Not if you’re in a Solo. Only one seat.
SBE $30 by Tues.
I am going to bet it is profit taking and not wanting to retail traders not wanting to hold over the weekend.
best part about fridays is i dont have to look at all the 0.01 expiring contracts on Monday
Gamestop forms Bullish penis pattern confirmed.
Seems like Monday calls and Tuesday puts is the move the past few weeks! Planning to load up on spy calls
Spy flat til close
STOP THE COUNT
Awesome, great explanation! And I sure hope it's 25 or so by Jan. Good luck to you!
IM ALL IN TSLA CALLS
[deleted]
Very good
How much per contract?
WMT pinned at exactly 150.00. Max pain. You hate to see it, but warned everyone.
Yep selling out all their cars "no one wants" if you can show me some data on "no one wanting" maybe I'll believe you, but before NIO's cars are off the line they are already sold. And you also completely underestimate the BaaS model and the fact they literally just released a cheaper car today as part of their joint venture in the Xpeng price range so??????
they don't have to know the truth!

they can't HANDLE the truth!
Best take profit now
i dont even understand this company i bought it cause of cathie wood and the rest of u guys
Yes
We’re down .5% bud
Rotate into SOLO
TSLA 11/27 550

yes.  It's just taking a breather from the recent rip.  Also today is garbage sideways and options expirations.
Damn, these bulls are on some other level with dip-buying...
Love how Sarah is giving this nerd the gears
Weak dump tbh. Expected more
Hyped. Sad. Either way I'm getting drunk
Same but i sold this morning like a dumbass, couldve had $5000, oh well
Everything is just slowly fading till EOD lmao. Slow-burned hour

Lol Nancy with that mid day pump
Just the fact that pltr jumped a dollar in literally less than 15 minutes this morning, leaves me zero worry that my losses today for holding will come back and more
Back to 19s on Monday I think
RIP my NVDA calls
I mean yea why tf would u buy calls if its red all week lmfao
Baba is safe jump in while America suffers
YEAH BOI! GREEN SQUAD!
gotta wealth transfer Europe’s money somehow!
fuck, same here....we are autists
I said this then my £2000 investment dropped 5.5% in an hour.

I have officially become an ordained member of the community.
Yeah maybe
Yea the sad part is I was up a lot on it but believed the hype and kept holding until it went worthless
[deleted]
...too soon to call it?
My bad guys, I haven’t bought fd SPY calls for 3 months. 

Call me Dr. Dump
**Who bought SOLO @ 13, show yourselves.**
Monday will be green.. This is just MM killing options.
This NYC teachers guy on CNBC is a real idiot
Yeah, it’s dancing around that as we speak.
sell off over? should i take profits on spy puts lol only 1k but oh well
what is this poor people shit
Chart looks like a giant erect pp. All the DD I need. 

I’m fucking in!

You know it’s a boring ass day when your losses from “the dump” just aren’t big enough to be funny or exciting
stfu
Oh WSB gods, I’ve offered 95% of my account. All I ask is PLTR to continue its mission to Mars next week
Why did we just plunge to the depths of the earth? Did another state shutdown?
Seriously. Was down hugely on my BKNG puts. Just sold enough to break even and still holding 4 of them, hoping for a collapse.
Happens almost everytime
Tesla is worth more than the major auto-mobile companies combined. To have such a valuation it would have to sell 20x the amount of cars that it currently sells to match at least Toyota. Maybe if in 10 years if the major car companies roll over and do nothing ev.
looks like we are back to "Wall Street dips on fading stimulus prospect"
lol GSX called out again and dumped in pre, so of course now it is getting all of it back

its so obvious anything that gets called out or shorted needs to just be bought like crazy, they just all go up
This do be some beta ass shit - 5 contracts? Get a life
If you buy the dip in power hour are you a power bottom 🤔
BIG WIN IN VACCINE NEWS TODAY, BY A LOT!
This logically makes sense

How did you lose money this week? Dafuq?
spy 354p end of month?
nvidia is kill
Lol these EOD dumps are becoming a ritual
sigh MSFT.
The man asked for DD, not insider information. Now the SEC is going to hunt us down. 🙄
That remark at the bottom there is a big ole slap in the dick
So PLTR gonna continue to deflate or do people think it'll gap up on Monday?
Yes bro
TSLA's that big-ass snake looking at the dude in the 'snake proof' suit thinking, "these bitches ain't got me to sign a release, I'm not eating that fucker"..
Ive fucked myself pretty hard many times. Just stop for a week.
Who played WORK? What was the news
Interactive Brokers.
Don't get trapped holding calls over the weekend bulls

2022 leaps 17.5c
I'm so sorry about that bro, stay strong, you'll get through this
Yeh false hope is still hope!
I loaded up on 20c 11/27 around 18.80 so there’s still hope
It’s pretty obvious where I started trading options lol. I got carried away by my greed and never stopped buying puts. Now I’m down to my last $47 and of course, it’s all in on 1/15 SPY 255p and 160p because why not. Luckily I’m only 20 years old and have plenty of actual investments set aside. Moral of the story is this: don’t get greedy and once you’ve doubled your initial deposit you should cash half out

What a lovely dip you have set out for us
We be honest that's the whole reason we still are in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is strategically important because of rare earth minerals.
[deleted]
This was the blood red Friday? Monday is going to be stupid green.
I bought spy 358c 11/27 good idea?
Is this the part where SPY just reverses and rip up out of nowhere?
Its china, obviously they are going to lie in order to not look bad to a American company in their own country.
All I want to know is if you came in your pants when you saw you hit 30k?
You bought.
Buy the dip because stonks go up.
Spy should dump to 0 so we can start from the beginning
I can go lower
The large amount of calls bought today for next week were a trap.. 🤡 I’m all in!
Wait for 18 pltr then buy
Bro what's your next play? Stocking with pton or moving on?
If you love money, you will buy NVDA Eod. Seen this fake bullshit way too many times, 540 on monday 100%

Lol hold up
That is what appears to be my game plan
Out of curiosity anyone betting on BDX?  I know this is a BEAR stock but it’s dropping like crazy and I know for a fact that all those vaccines need to be injected into us.  That means it needs to go into syringes and needles need to go into us.  And BDX OWNS THIS SPACE.  Governments are contracting with them directly just for these products because these have all passed FDA and HC.  This division is a huge part of BDX.  

I know shit, and this is my first crack at DD btw but I do work in this segment.  But I am a total autist and am deep into PLTR and NIO so wtf do I know.
Bling dat CPR son.
Still holding?
Green by close - hard green rocket cocks incoming - get ready
I think your dad should have withdrawn...
When all these retards are buying 0, 1 and 2 DTE calls, they hurtin
How many times does TSLA want to hit 490 today
NVDA gonna somehow turn positive before close? What a dog!
[deleted]
Okay then lol. I don't know anything your right. I don't do contracting. I don't process anything with telos it was all a lie for internet points.
Buy CRSR or SBE calls
Just buy nio calls now
nvda is just tracking spy rn but dropping way more. so dumb

Cmon, cheer up bud, only numbers on a screen! The weekend is ahead!
I got 1
Focus on the meme stocks
That’s pretty exciting that we could possibly see such a huge squeeze. Do you see it happening by January? For op sake I hope it happens. That would be crazy life changing.
TSLA needs to quit playin
He didn’t do it though, his mommy and daddy did.
If it dips to around 18 I'd buy more
Baba is safe lol
I'm pretty sure I bought 4 shares at $100. So basically at the top.

Edit.. well isn't that interesting. Ballard trading in the $25 range and up 8% today. Maybe 2021 is the year of hydrogen!!
Thank you PLTR, time to load up on more shares 😋😋
Thick rope... would he embarrassing to snap the rope.
All naked puts.  Naked puts are correctible, so let's say that I'm off a bit, and in Jan, PLTR is at 19.75.  I'll probably take the 20's as shares, but roll the 22's to Feb for even more premium.

I think it'll be way higher than that, though.  I predict 25's for Jan in my future.

Just sell before the bleed

Yes broham
No one wants a chinese tesla at tesla prices (nio). Chinese tesla at half the price (xpev), that's mint.
Of your asshole ok I’ll buy it

Another fake sell off, probably  :-/
Lmao stocks
LOOOOOOL no more stimmy?? Hahhaa
7x 11/27 QQQ 293p puts bought at 3.37 earlier today... bled out till now

shorted 7x 11/27 QQQ 292.5p @ 3.55

closed out my 50x 11/20 QQQ 293/292.5c credit spreads
I’m assuming this sell off is because of shutdowns but it’s going the wrong way zoom 😂
Sounds about what this market would pull

Come on, let’s get this back up, we don’t want to end the week this way.
Stonks dont go down.

The Friday dump of the Dow. So predictable at this point.

I've made profit going up and down with expev so far. I'll stick with my long calls for now
Whats on the dip that looks good for next week?
Couldn’t you set a limit sell on them and avoid that? Lol
Missed out on 20 k gains on ZM and got 1k instead so I spent the day revenge buying more calls even though I knew it’d dip EOD. Gotta take the emotion out of this shit.
For real, everybody panicking for nothing lmfao.
woah spy on some laxatives

FCEL went public 25th June 1992. It’s cumulative return is -92% over that time. It uses molten carbonate fuel for fuck sake. The only reason it’s going up is because of the beta it has to to the ‘fuel efficiency’ market. EV is a complete different ballgame
I want a slight dip so i get get in on some tendies but they are talking about more school shutdowns and im assuming in january online school will be required too

Yah, worried though that iPhone pre-orders will be included in that, no?
What’s up with these red candles? I thought we only go up?
What’s financials? To the moon retards
Of course the sell off begins the minute after RH forces me to sell my weekly puts
If only we had a crystal ball - I was mining bitcoins and trying to buy them back in 2013.. Gave up because it was a pain in the ass - back then you could mine 0.5-1 coin a day on basic rig
OP misunderstands how reserve funds work. When the fed buys bonds, it credits the reserve account of the relevant bank (this is what is actually happening when the fed is ‘printing money’). This reserve account is essentially the same thing as a checking for individuals. Now, by regulation, banks have to keep a certain percentage of their deposit liabilities in this checking account to make sure they can meet withdrawal requests by their customers. This requirement is currently ZERO—I.e., banks do not need to keep any funds in this reserve account. They still will because unlike what OP stated, fed reserves are not just used as collateral. They are used to settle transactions between banks and bank customers for example. 

Now, since banks don’t need to have ANY reserves at the moment, they can do whatever they want with that freed up cash. They can originate new mortgages, they can buy assets, etc. 

No comments on lack of lending and it’s effects on the economy, but to claim that reserves are dead money that can only be used as collateral is hilariously wrong.
Any thoughts on DXCM?
I wish I wasn't such a pussy😔

So annoying when short options refuse to go to 0.01, you’re 3% OTM with 45 minutes left, stop putting in 0.02 bids
If you want it to. But then you better bring hair dye.
I’ve had mine forever but just read the market is only open til 1pm instead of 4...

1) Get a real broker

2) Don't worry about it, it's obviously going to close at 355.01
350?
If you missed out on NIO this week so far. Buy the dip. Just a friendly suggestion
Trade Republic only has "Optionscheine" and "Knock-Out Zertifkate". Optionsscheine is very complex (you will get fucked by volatility) they are expensive and leverage is not very high. The Knock-out certificates are more like options with guaranteed stop loss, meaning you cant lose more than 100%, these are better but depending on leverage and volatility of the underlying they would not be a good option - because volatility could trigger the knock- out and you lose 100%. True Options are rare for private investors in Germany, Interactive Brokers (Lynx) has them.
🤡🤡🤡 it's down .75% now, wait till it gets 1%
Yes $40-50M is possible if it jumps 10x within 1.5 months. But that’s also possible for virtually any stock out there. Anything that jumps 10x within a month is gonna mint millionaires.

Holy shit NVDA just fell through that resistance. I'm done.
Moderna is 2 doses
Highly doubt this as their revenue statement for 3 months ending Sept 30 2020 was $47.4M
My Vix is still red. Unbelievable
Sometimes to torture myself I like to see where i bought and sold stocks my first time. Fucking bought 500 SQ for $13.45 and sold 4 months later for $13.60 because it was so boring. Bought it back at $9.43 and sold it right away. GUH.
did the same with cyrx recently

still waiting for that rat fuck to expire
Don’t most successful NYers send their kids to private schools anyway?

Buy high sell low, I bought at 19.40
Bullish let's see next 5 years where the price will be
The only two secure stocks I can see for EV's is charging station companies and Tesla.

The rest is highly speculative as to which company is going to survive the end of the EV boom. There's just too much competition right now for everyone to make it out of this alive.
Wish it was mooning rn

Me big retard i was on IBIO when shit like this happened. Lost a good chunk thought history would repeat
Yeah probably tbh. Made a good 40% on it, sold at peak today. Could be a good buy back in if it falls more

This is the only thing that worries me and the risk i see. i've seen the EV companies seizing their opportunity recently and expect more to do the same soon; which is why i am thinking shares/leaps, but let's see what happens in a few months time
You mean holding over the weekend or buying too early?
Need little nio pump
If someone could explain to my wife’s boyfriend why I’m retarded for not taking 420% profit on my fubo options and instead letting them expire worthless that’d be great

Make a big poo-poo for Daddy.
Get out.  People taking profits pre-Holiday and CoVid blow-up .
Jumped back into trading early nov after losing over 50k first week of sept thinking it was time to get back on the horse. Using only like 20-25k to make “safe” bets buying shares and a few small long calls and debit spreads, I have managed to lose another 2k since the start of the month. I think this is a sign
MINE TOO
4k volume on 15.5 c for gme next week

hmmm
Puts at close. Poor bastard who is yolo’ing 50k in spy calls at close is doomed.

AAPL and SPY puts got most of me, also chasing ROKU around after morning parabolics these past couple days.
Oh look, a tech sell-off. What else is new. Everybody leaving tech to chase the next best thing, when the money-maker is still tech. See you when you get back. For now, I sit on my quarterly dividends.
Broke under resistance, free fall from here
There is going to be a last minute hulk green dildo at the very end.
PLTR not lookin' good guys. What are y'all positions?
SPY ded
I got PLTR 12/18 25-26 so heres to hoping. Everybody and their grandmother have been boofing up PLTR so I'm in it
I’m glad you broke even Man, shits rough. Maybe pull majority and use what you’re comfortable with losing then use that to build up from “nothing”

Oh, you mean I might be able to get $.40 for my 6 ($1000) contracts expiring in 30 minutes?

Hell yeah, definately a bigass reversal. I'm going with OTM with this one
My portfolio at levels not seen since... yesterday morning.
Once again the MMs fuck calls holders on Friday... who could have seen this coming
Have PLTR got a COVID response contract or is this an assumption they would be used?
anyone in AAPL leaps? suggest something?

Don't let them see this post or you might get passed over.  

Best of luck.  Hope your job isn't in the financial sector.
if it can break out of this 290-295 range, I think it will hit $315 quickly
It can still be in a bubble.

Future proof industries generally do find themselves in a bubble early on due to hype. EV is the future and it's probably going to have long term success but EV's are already highly overvalued and the bubble probably will burst at some point before settling back at a more realistic growth rate.

At this point I agree,

Play the market in the short term if you can handle the risk but I wouldn't go long until that bubble bursts.
Don' forget CIIC. That's actually a great EV company, too.

**Dr. Lisa Su Knows What's Up**

The market did not react well to AMD purchasing Xilinx. But Dr. Lisa Su knows exactly why this is a critical part of their roadmap over the next few years. They will die without it. Here's why.

**x86 Is Dying**

The x86 architecture hit the top of its bell curve, and things are transitioning to ARM. ARM isn't just winning power-efficiency contests anymore, they're winning in performance per watt in many new high-end scenarios like the server market.

* Apple is the most obvious Canary in the coal mine with the [M1 macs](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/) - with [ARM's IPC beating x86](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/axy8mo/arm_versus_x86_ipc_skylake_zen_n1_thunderx2/)
* Amazon AWS [Graviton ARM based chips](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) - a huge cost savings for many types of servers
* [NVIDIA acquiring ARM for $40 billion](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai)
* Microsoft has been trying to make [Windows on ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/) happen for a long time, and now that Apple has done it, we'll probably see this accelerate since it's now posh to have an ARM processor. Microsoft has a problem where they need cheap laptops with good battery life. They can't do that with power-hungry cheap x86 chips, and laptop makers want to use smaller batteries. ARM is the solution.
* The obvious ubiquity of ARM on mobile and power-restricted devices
* The fact that there are many more companies innovating on ARM compared to only AMD / Intel driving x86 innovation.

**The Future Transition To ARM**

This transition isn't happening for no reason. The economics of performance per watt drive this industry. Consumers want more battery life (phones, laptops, cars), enterprise wants cheaper to run cloud servers.

As ARM continues to become superior in raw power in more business cases, while X86 continues to see diminishing returns with each generation, the software market will inevitably start switching over to ARM. MacOS Big Sur is the #1 catalyst.

Cross-platform software development systems are going to make the software transition easy. Flutter and Electron are examples that [compile code to x86 and ARM native environments.](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/faq#run-android)

Unity has made a huge push for[ Game development on ARM.](https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/08/arm-partners-with-unity-to-make-3d-run-everywhere/)

**AMD & Xilinx**

So how do AMD and Xilinx come into this whole scenario? Xilinx already has an SoC portfolio for everything from [low-end cost-optimized ARM to high-end CPU + GPU systems.](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc.html) AMD will need to break into the ARM market, and Xilinx is their way of buying accelerated entry.

Together, Xilinx and AMD will combine their technology and proficiencies to produce high-end workstation, game console, automotive, and server-grade ARM chips.

This transition will further accelerate the pace that AMD is able to take marketshare from Intel as more software is built for ARM systems.

**Intel**

Intel really needs their x86 breakthrough to get to the market. Their [Alder Lake-S architecture is supposed to be the answer to ARM's power efficiency.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021) But the delays have put intel in a precarious position. Had these chips launched on-time - Apple may have avoided transitioning to their own ARM chips for desktop quite as soon ([it seems to have been their plan since Skylake however](https://www.pcmag.com/news/former-intel-engineer-explains-why-apple-switched-to-arm)). Intel has been on the defensive for a while, and these delays are what ARM needed to catch up and surpass in market share.

Now that Alder Lake-S is delayed until the second half of 2021, it's giving ARM critical time to evolve and take more market. The more of the market that uses ARM, the more ARM innovation will continue.

**AMD's Future Without Xilinx**

If AMD continues down a path of pure x86 architecture development, the rest of the market will leave them behind. NVIDIA will be soon getting into the high-end ARM desktop and server market. We know they need to for performance per watt competition - especially in the automotive ML space. We've already seen Apple and Amazon start transitioning.

**Intel is like a stubborn child who will not change.**

AMD can continue to optimize x86 down the popularity bell curve while gaining early entry and innovation in the ARM market - though they are still behind in experience and execution compared to nVidia, Apple, and Amazon, Xilinx is their accelerator to catch up.

**AMD + Apple (Very Speculative)**

AMD already has a long history with apple for providing graphics solutions. If AMD is able to start offering high-end ARM-based CPU solutions along with their dedicated high-end ARM-compatible graphics solutions, we may see Apple utilize AMD processors on their higher-end "Pro" lines of laptop and desktop systems. However, this is also a huge opportunity for nVidia.

Apple may be able to compete easily in the graphics space against Intel's integrated graphics solutions. But it remains to be seen if they are interested in entering the high-end GPU scene. This is a major opportunity for nVidia and AMD arm compatible solutions.

We will likely see the Apple M2 chip be compatible with an nVidia or AMD graphics solution by the end of 2022.

no idea, but I exited most of my positions, still holding a 12/4 265c and a couple 12/18 305c that have been getting theta raped
We holding ATM baba calls this weekend right?
We Buying the KNDI Dip here. Offering, lets move past that
Since stocks only go up, a dip is a deviation from "up." 

Up- not dip 

Sideways- dip

Down- dip

You can buy any stock at any time to get a positive return. If you buy the dip you don't have to wait as long tho
ofcourse there is a sell off in power hour, I am holding them whole day like a jackass just to lose more 🤡
[witching hour irl](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N-j6TDUNBuc)
No baby... that’s WSB.
Back of the napkin math puts you at around $8k taxes, assuming you're not a millionaire (upper margin).  So the advice to set aside $10k is sound.  Just to back him up.
Will be quickly approved but the real benefit goes to BNTX, much of which has been priced in today (to my benefit). BNTX owns half the gross profit of the vaccine (they designed it), but their market cap is 1/10 of PFE’s, so much greater impact for them.

This vaccine also validated their entire mRNA platform in a sense, so it’s a huge long term boost for them (basically they’re gonna help make cancer go away). Same goes for Moderna - same basic technology, also validated by their vaccine. In both cases it’ll be the first product they’ve ever brought to market.

Frankly I think both stocks should double or more in the next year or two, though there could be dips when AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson announce their vaccines. That ought to be mostly priced in, but I thought that about BNTX before MRNA announced and was wrong (BNTX tanked for a week or so).
3pm rug pull!
I have a bad feeling pltr is thinking about dipping under 18
Bang. Look at that, what a coincidence we always tank in power hour every Friday...
Look at SPY go!
Sold covered calls against PLTR @ 19.50, Almost thought i was gonna have to eat a loss
$SPY call at 3:59 free $
You lose all your money?
Start by learning what the fuck the VIX is

Then come ask dumb questions after
??? U think QQQ can go to 315?
Oh shit the economy lol
Holding until January
Going to eat the theta loss?
lmao bye bye SPY
Saw someone purchase about 400k shares and a ton of call buys at the 80c 1/21.  I’ll see if I can find it again, I’m an autist so I’m ok with the possible 60 loss
AYRO got some of yall holding bags
Gotta pay to play. Hopefully it was a 4K lesson on your way to eventual tendies. Here's a tip don't get too fancy, slow down and stop fomo'ing. I know this gay but maybe even buy some shares as a hedge in a stock with huge upside.
🙋
Can't wait for Jack Ma to burn the Chinese flag after I place half my portfolio in BABA.
Should I buy this dip, it hasn’t worked for me at all this week but as a bull I feel obligated to
you deserve it for even being in that situation
Fuck AAPL
Blood red
Dump it
I am expecting them to dilute shares soon
there she goes
SPY taking a fat dump
My portfolio resonates with this
I'm going to cum if we hit 354
FFFF
Literally just buy and hold.
I think it’s been priced in for ages, AZ was leading the way for time... sure it may go up a little, but bigger gains can probably be found elsewhere.
Same here
Puts on this gold digging bitch
who am i buying eod calls on
Alright m80
I am a college educated white boy with a family and higher level income. For some reason they love me!
Thought spy wouldnt tank since i waited 10 min after the announcements to buy spy calls. 

Spy tanked right after that. GUH
Me, and I've lost a lot of money on tesla puts..
It's over guys. Take them gains before they gone
I mean i have to seeing that i am down $1k+

Great day with BABA. I could afford to buy a Lambo ^((replacement key to the Lambo I don't yet own)).

Im hoping the holidays will give it a boost and the lock down helps.
my guy
...cause you can't spell the ticker properly, so they probably think you are a tard.
Same retard. Same.
QQQ calls could look really fucking good next week

Nasdaq has been consolidating for months in a cup and handle so i think a 20%+ move within a couple weeks is likely if QQQ flips 300 into support and nasdaq flips 12k into support

Even just a 10% move on QQQ puts it at 330ish. That would be a 25x return on the 12/18 $315 calls at current price of $60

I'm scaling into QQQ $315C 12/18

you think it will continue next week?  i have 12/18 300c
If you are confident in the direction but not the timing, why not just load up on SPXS shares? Genuinely curious.

SPY and/or IWM, I suppose.
Meanwhile BABA is Headed to the moon!!

PYPL you rat bastard waited until the last hour lmao
WHO just put a warning on their vaccine yo
What a day! BABA still mooning while SPY tanking
Thanks buddy, I think it's time to start doing just that  XD
A lot of the big players in the market are tech companies which are experiencing a boom due to ppl being at home. Markets don't necessarily reflect the economy in these situations. Less spending overall (economy), but more spending on tech (majority of the market).
Not buying FDs actually means you are less retarded than 90% of the people on here.
ha, ok, that was good

well done OP, you're slightly less retarded than the rest of us
Short or long? I think that 280 Dec calls are a safe bet, and 300 Jan/Feb calls are pretty solid too. Premiums are pricey though, personally. I'm currently holding a 300 Jan

I don’t like when SPY AND VXX go down. Makes me sad boy.
Yup, that's my reasoning to hold as well. This will only be a minor dip. It will recover next week. I held just the same with NIO after the Citron report, and I will do so here.
Is RBLX the next meme stonk?
ton of sell orders between 272-273 right now, eventually it will break

Same.
Closed all my positions today for a whopping: -3 dollar loss. All the moves look played out already so I’m cash for the weekend
I am **thrilled to see a SUMO DD post on WSB**

I bought 510 shares on 10/16 for $22... It’s been a rough month to say the least. I was between FROG, SUMO, PLTR and UPWK. Would’ve been up some 80-90% on the latter two but it is what it is...

*I work at a bank and have 30 day hold restrictions for equities* 

I echo most of your points above but what did it for me was the low P/S vs it’s peers, high TAM, low market cap and cloud-native approach to SIEM. The lack of press releases has been disappointing but I’m hoping SUMO crushes earnings expectations and this becomes a household name. The volume some days has just been brutal...

Anyway, here’s to a run to $30 🥂
Obviously...

I got in right before the top on the last pump and didn’t cut losses early during the dump, so held until they pumped it again and made a measly 15%. The pump I got out on would have made me about 30% but I just wanted out.
EOD dump I’m ready for you
Just pick a direction SPY god damn
But I might be overthinking the market by saying that too. Idk man! Nobody does!
Is baba squeezing
They pumped stocks how many times today and spy couldn’t break out positive even once.
Same goes with tesla
I guess it’s cool to post a ticker after its already run up 50% in the past week acting like an autist

Alright buddy take your own advice and don’t follow your advice you gotta inverse your next idea and ride back to glory
The PT is like $30, at this point they are getting way overvalued too quickly which means at some point it is going to have a severe correction

We skipped the entire $30 range in the last 4 days. Just shot right past it so I think we will see a re-test of the $30's at some point....

Most TP are around $2.5

Strong pass
aapl has not moved in ~2.5 months. so lame
I sold NIO 2 weeks ago. Been crying about EVs since then. To be fair I bought PLTR and CRSR ....................and BABA with the money, so its ain't too bad.
Mango's lawyer does not hold up well above room temperature.
I don't wanna share em cause it's too small of an amount to really give a shit about. I lost a lot, was left with $20 and now I'm climbing back from that
Plenty of time my guy. BABA 290C Jan 15th is still looking juicy
Still don’t see how AMD $110c June 2021 isn’t free money.

Oh Africa, never change. (It won't.)

Yep, this is a gay bear attempt at its finest .
fr next week
BABA and CRSR, I understand guys, see u on the moon 🚀
from now on people should not be showing this unless they came on this forum an told everyone the play they were making and have that comment put into this thread. yall being selfish and stingy.
$CLF will hit crazy next week watch
Only industry with cash on hand...eh? I mean, there's a case for a value investment but not much grounds to be bullish.

Where are your bets for Monday?
People have been saying it would happen since Cohen got involved.  See my post today about his law firm on retainer: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxscc7/for\_those\_wondering\_why\_gme\_is\_going\_up\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jxscc7/for_those_wondering_why_gme_is_going_up_again/)

With the letter he just sent this week, I think its fairly likely.  There are 4 options from here.  Cohen can add to his stake and try to oust the current CEO.  Cohen can submit an offer to buy the company entirely. The current board can fix the issues he requested be fixed.  Cohen can walk away.

The only thing that doesn't cause the stock to go way up is if he walked away, in which case the stock would probably dump for a few weeks.  This seems very unlikely though based on his actions thus far, and over the long term the stock is still going way up.
You missed the “S” on the front of that ticker
BABA ROCKETING OFF
Sad I never pulled the trigger on BABA
Well my calls peaked at 130% today bought yesterday, so he’s probably doing pretty good
this dump is too slow. need more action
Interesting, thanks for sharing. Where did you find that?
My first ten bagger, thanks DOCU
will msft move? all this cloud hype and it still sucks
Smarch calls are better.
Totally agree. If SOLO hits anywhere from $3-5 in the next few months I’ll make over $15 grand and Citron just came out with a price target of $2 lol
thanks i needed this
I just saw a Pelaton truck deliver - I’m all in

SPY 355.78 EOD.
I'm a retard and don't fully understand calls. I just bought shares and plan to hold for the long haul.
Give it up bitch. Go to sleep
January 21 $50 call is cheap and so good. It'll get to $48ish by middle of December and then probably start to pull back some. But that's still great profit
Seeing bond yield plummeting at this rate is actually a bit worrisome. Hopefully it's just hedge against deflationary threats if FED or treasury fucks up with brrrt
Didn’t Morgan Stanley also upgrade Tesla price target??
No dumps allowed. Buy calls
oh shit next week is thanksgiving. shouldnt have gotten 11/27 calls damn

Hello margin
CLF is whack as fuck
Dec 15 Vix 30 call at $1.60 . That is going to be free money in december. Its going to be unstable and the volatility is going to spike to give you chance to cash out atleast at 100% gain.
Loaded up.  Should have took the 30% profits but I’m greedy so I’m holding over weekend
what the FUCK is spy doing
Thanksgiving. But remember no one's traveling and everyone will be on their phone.
It’s the path of least resistance.

I lost a lot of money today - Good thing I know all those losses disappear when we open on monday!
I got some Leaps when it was at 100, i m still holding
***yawn***
I like this stock. With the threats of new lockdowns I think there is room for growth. It is a competitive market though with doordash and ubereats but I like they are targeting the underdevopled market.
Had $115 gain and now it's down to $95-$100 gain. Debating on playing "Big Bank"- Big KRIT regardless later today
My calls are breaking even after being way up earlier this week. Do I sell out or double down 🤔
I’m a true autist sorry thanks for the edit

I bought Decenber PLTR calls at 18.5. Good entry point?
TSLA Power hour! Going green or BAN!
Anybody in CRON? I’m ready to get some puts. I think we dump the next few months. Thoughts?
It will keep going up because the rona will get worse and the vaccine won’t be ready to the general population for a couple months. I’m buying puts on it around late December early Jan for 2 months out, should be easy money
Damn. Did you get in near ATH or ride it all the way up and down?
Can someone explain this to me?

Right now I am trying to buy a DKNG option. Bid ask is .45 and .55. When I sell at .50 I see my order plus 8 at .5. When I change it to .55 the 8 and my order are gone.
Hopefully PLTR makes up for lost time

I mean I get it but like fuck really, my gfs dad just bought 50 shares of NIO and I’m trying to get him to gtfo
I feel you.  These are still automotive businesses and auto is a highly competitive capital intensive industry.  It’s max brutality, don’t invest in auto it fuckin sucks
It's pinned so I have to go in
Don't waste your time trying to trade next week. Go outside and kill some shit to eat. The market will be low volume and lame.

Shoulda bought a mcflurry instead
I just realized that charts are pretty phallic.
First I gave you my triple clown buy alert on TLT and BABA at the absolute bottom and you laughed at me.

Then I told you to go all in TLRY yesterday, and you called me, quote, "retarded." 

Now I am telling you that this your entry in QQQ. Don't fuck this up
Chill man stonks don’t dildo all day your Ass hole needs time to repair and consolidate before next green Dildo destruction
\-64 comment karma huh. wth! lol

Spy forming the dreaded "Fuck Option Holders" pattern
Right there with ya. I wonder if there's more headroom for BLNK next week.
Because he knows shits bout to go nuts!!
Lmao 😂
Yeah my 91 is basically a portion of the profits from an 80 I had got for earnings and sold out of at 86 or 87.  Allowed me to to pick up a few shares for my boomer portfolio for free, so anything it makes is just gravy.

I am just starting out so I am not 100% but based on my research gains are split into short term and long term. One year being the line in the sand.

You can offset your gains with your losses. For example, if you gained 45K on this stock but then used 30K to buy something else and lost it all, your net would be 15K.  Assuming you don't trade anything else till the end of year,

For the most part, your long term gains can offset your long term losses and same for short term gains being offset by short term losses. You can them use those to offset each other. Personally, I would get an accountant for that part but just know the basics.

Short term gains are taxed 0% up to 37% depending on your income.

Long term gains are taxed 0% up to 20% again depending on your income.

Again the main thing is how long you hold the stock before you sell. One year is the answer.
That’s what I was thinking. If I could clear $200 off it would be fine, but been down around $100 all day due to theta 🔥.

The good thing about options is that they come with built-in expiry date, for relationships one has to figure out by himself....

That would be way too good to be true
This...is buying NIO at the bottom?

Wow that's peak retard
Don’t think he’s going to have a problem with that
Greed or guaranteed profit? Why is this so hard
20% more and im at 25k come on nio....
We won’t read a post longer than 3 sentences.  You think we are going to read this fucking bullshit.

Should have bought BLNK calls instead of PLTR
Best of all: guess what I liquidated yesterday to buy calls? PLTR😂😂🧠
Why?
The irony is lost on many.
I’ve got mostly shares, don’t play around with weeklies. There could be some short term volatility but we’ll trend up the next few months. I’d do further out leaps into Q1 but I know that’s not the WSB way 😂
I love the buy high sell low people buying xpeng at the top instead of NIO near the bottom. This is why the real traders make bank right here classic shit 😂if you bought xpeng over 51 or 52 you’re gunna need to wait for it to boost back up next week before you can sell after the initial dip to the 40s
BABA 12/31 295c no?
Guys I did it. I broke Nio as soon as I bought call.
Whoever told me to buy COTY calls go fuck yourself

Literally been looking at \~10 stocks today and kept pricing out options for hours -- have yet to pull the trigger...
Might be waiting for a bit strong support at $16.50 - 17
Yeah you’re right. But the risk of CRSR dipping was too high while PTON was near support and only had upsides. Not that upset, looking forward to getting back into CRSR once it cools down a bit
That’s a meta AF comment.
jesus christ at least get the fucking website right retard
lots of rambling statements that did not make sense, as usual. No one ever told him about Good RX.

Xpev went well high today. Good call.
What do you do with blue? I'm not familiar with what that color means. Do I buy calls or puts on blue?
Is anyone sick of the fucking EV/Chinese EV shit, like I MAYBE could understand the NIO XPENG LI argument if I was drunk enough but even then it is shit (Tesla is better but still too high imo) . I just bought puts on SOLO cause why the fuck is a company who is selling a 3-wheeled, 100 mile range, 2.5 hour charge vehicle valued at almost 1 billion dollars. And they aren’t even selling them cause they haven’t hit production. The only incoming cash flow they have were from custom roadsters and that was only $300k. Yet somehow they’re sitting on like $50-100m cash. Fuck that I’m starting an EV company called ShitV to make a quick $100m.

Yea it’s a weird case basically Clovers current owners are implicated by owning hospitals in NJ, with the IPOC deal,,well, they will basically be previously inclined “owners”. It’s a pretty complex web and they may have given a $60 ml loan under Carepoint to fund some things including Clover. IMO they are a company who is perfect for SPAC due to this scenario, public ownership will be great tool here.

just hit 40, crsr is wild
Dude seriously this is hilarious
Yahoo is fucking stupid, do the math yourself and you'll see that it's wrong. A 300% short interest would mean 120 million shares shorted, not 67 million.
Generally speaking I'd say it's a day when the stock is negative/in the red. Buy low, sell high. Wait for it to dip down so you get the most value when it goes back up. How much it needs to go down for it to be a "dip" is really the name of the game. That's up to you.

Not necessarily lucky. A lot of businessman become successful because of their good decision taking power, discipline, dedication, and vision. They may not necessarily be tech smart or smart in any particular business field. Maybe he is good at predicting the wave of change in the market requirements in China. Maybe he understand market of China better than others and hence managed to take bold decisions. Number of factors at play.
Lol, don’t blame you.  I don’t have the stones to yolo and I am perfectly ok with that.

Anybody else seeing the bear flag on SOLO?
Locked in my calls at 400% gain, this is too retarded for me.


Unfortuantely I only threw in 100 bucks into the calls as a lottery ticket, should've put a bit more in i guess

Wrong spot to post this kind of stuff most of these guys don’t understand what a chart is they just get a scrabble bag and pick letters and buy calls. Then they will try and tell you it’s not a bubble.

Man than sell the strike over yours ! Close profits by turning it into a spread
On one hand I can’t wait for 4pm so I can look forward to next weeks gains on some long calls. 

On the other hand, I don’t want to the weekend to come because I’ll be nervous about next week and my long calls.
Don’t let this stagnant market distract you from the fact that

 >!i just learned how to do this and I wanted to try it out!<
>I just don’t know where is Nio making profit,

They're not.  They need to reduce their operating expenses and/or increase their margins.

They can't raise their price for better margins because it will negatively impact their sales.  When shopping, people don't want to pay more money for a brand that they've never heard of.  When entering a market with a new brand, you can't charge more than your competitors unless you have more to offer.  However, if you try to offer more - your costs to produce the product go up...which reduces your margins.  Alternatively, you can try to offer less for a substantially lower price point.  The last thing you can do is build up your brand.  Brand-building is NIO's current game plan.  In the US, a brand usually develops over time, as their products get polished.  NIO (and China in general) is trying to do this in reverse order.  They are spending tons of cash (mostly US investor money) to polish up a new brand, before they create a polished product. Q3 earnings shows $0.5B in cost of sales expense (i.e. fancy stores that serve Mojitos and have toilets with fancy remote controls).

Their stores are meant to create a sense of being established; having lots of value/worth.  It's purely a marketing ploy and it is very effective.  Even in this sub, after watching videos of these stores - people are saying that the video makes them want to buy something with the NIO name on it.  When you see all this fancy stuff, the mind starts to associate their brand with luxury and success.  That's because you've been conditioned to think this way, and they're exploiting that.  If anyone disagrees - just think of the last time you used the term "*no-name brand*" to describe something.

The problem with trying to create a tangible-product brand in China is that the Chinese don't respect trademarks.  As with every brand in the world, as soon as a brand name starts to trend - the factories in China spin up and flood Alibaba with cheap things branded with that name.  Very interesting to hear that your contacts in China don't want a Chinese brand; I wonder why that is.

Volume is also an essential factor for profitability.  In general, the supply chain gets cheaper for everything, when you order larger quantities.  The price of all the parts going into a vehicle get cheaper when you start ordering very large quantities of them.  When expenses decrease, profit increases.  Sales volume has an exponential effect on profit.  Buying parts to make 100 cars might leave you with a 1% profit margin.  When you buy parts to make 1000 cars, your profit margin could jump to 10%.  1% of $100k vs 10% of $100M.

TLDR: NIO will not be profitable until the Chinese people start actually wanting these cars (without any subsidies).  From what it sounds like, the middle class Chinese don't care for them but the US investors think they do.

Alright, adobe sign - yes - others are not that popular, there probably is space for duopoly. But have you noticed the extraordinary revenue run rate of Docusign? Not to mention that they are expanding their service around legal services, notary etc..

If you were a popular video game maker, would you rather sell your game at gamestop or amazon? 

Also, try selling your somewhat new games back to gamestop. LOL. 💁‍♂️😂

Man, imagine if GME and steam powered partnered on anything though ... strategically, thats a HUGE win for gamestop. 🚀🚀🚀

What did I miss?
WSB IS ABOUT FCKING OPTIONS - FCK OFF W THE POLITICS FIGGITS
There isn't really a way to do the math for what this would look like for GME.  There are too many unknown variables.  Would all of the institutions recall their shares?  How many people would short on the way up.  How large of an offer would be made? If he made an offer at $30, algos would instantly buy all the shares available under $30. etc.

I can tell you that outside of a squeeze, if GME went to a similar price to sales ratio as best buy (closest peer) or corsair, the stock would be trading at around 60/220 per share respectively.  I can tell you that if GME went to its market cap from the last console cycle, or the one before, it woudl trade at 100/151 respectively.

&#x200B;

Those valuation metrics aren't exact comparisons obviously, but it puts in perspective how cheap GME is. I don't expect it to sit at those valuations anytime soon, and without a continued massive turnaround push.  I'll be thrilled if this goes up to 30, but it has the ability to run vastly higher, especially in the event of a squeeze.

I'm looking to hedge a bit against potential downturn particularly in the junk bond market, for 2021. I thought a put or 2 here and there in 2021 on HYG might be a good call for this, but nearly every HYG option is at 0 volume. Does anyone have any recommendation on where would be a good avenue for further DD into corporate bond puts?

You owe taxes on all the stocks that you sold this year, even if you reinvest the profit.

If you held the stock for a year or more before selling then you only have to pay the long term capital gains tax, either 15% or 20% based on your income.

If you bought and sold the stock within the same year then you pay the taxes at your marginal tax rate, again based on your income.

Google "long-term vs short-term income tax" and also put at least $10k in a high yield savings account tomorrow that you can access when you have to pay your taxes next year.
26m shares w TSLA? What. A. Fucking. JOKE
AMZN has been looking so bullish for a week now but it can't seem to breakout

I’m holding - but stonks.
nice I was debating 290 as well but I have a fuck ton of money tied up in DKNG at the moment and wanted to keep some cash on the sides for hedges and other good dips. No way either of ours dont print especially if ANT IPOs soon.

Don’t tell me you actually own Kodak
You realize the dollar per share value can't be compared between companies right?
I mean you can Google it of course but basically they get credits for being green and they sold those credits to become profitable. The green credit market is why you need to be suspicious of any company that claims to be carbon neutral....they maybe but it's because they are buying up carbon credits to offset their shityness. Tesla has used this to become profitable.
This morning I opened up Jan @ 20 for a 21% premium.

trading strategy:  **SPY Dec 9 2020 360.000 put.**

I will post signals here for bottoms when the red line hits the green line you open a call 20 days out if red line hits red you open a put 20 days out.

GA Senate race looking like it'll be a democratic win. There's already a stack of cannabis legislature sitting in Mitch's desk ready to be voted on.

I have no clue. My thought is it's going to rage into earnings but won't be able to live up the the hype, no matter how much they knock it out of the park. But I also don't pay attention to or care to trade the news. Definitely not advice, just sharing my personal thoughts.
Do you even have to ask? 

Over the weekend they secure a TSLA partnership, or something
trump sounds like a loser lol
Same
There is a certain tone with pump and dumps on here. They like to put alot of words and theyre are usually ghost accounts commenting “all in”. Alittle bit of digging will show that its all bullshit. A good DD post will have good comments to go with it, and opposing view sentiments. Usually a stock going up will continue, timing a massive pop is retarded and will likely result in a 99/100 loss.
Same learned my lesson last time, +600% in a week is more than I could have hoped for.
not holding, about to jump back in
Let me know. In the same boat.
It’s gonna happen at 3:55
is it some EV shit?
Him talking right now.
I love that in the background of the chorus there’s just a guy screaming “BREAK THE LAW”

Can I get me some of those "unapproved drugs?"
Do you know where the setting is in the app to enable it? Or do you just have to wait for a pop up? 

Thanks!
Feel bad for the retard who bought SOLO at 13 dollars
Yup, no reason for it to be under $300, oversold
I'm trying to get 3x Bear puts
Source?
Last 2k. Am I better off buying the dip at 3:30 or waiting till Monday. ?
rest of the world markets green

SPY like "nah, imma chill here"
yeah it is. i have calls
Baby Baba is my little long term hold can’t wait for normality
Mind if I hop on the BABA train with you?
I'm hoping it rallies, I ain't got ant day trades... lol
Buy the Big Pharma dip, Biden will make Big Pharma great again
Vldr $25c 27 dec20 and erii $12.50c 19feb20
Basically. Also on general news that a vaccine isn't going to be fully deployed until the summer or beyond
A toddler could have traded better than me this past week
Obviously. But I’m mostly talking about the braindead people who are always posting about how they sold everything to “buy back in cheaper” and wondering why the market isn’t crashing all the time.
Why did all weed stocks just go up?
Spy is boomer
Puts on big pharma

You actually have to start with 2 million if you want to get to a million
Big mistake 💩
This would be way funnier.
How many times do we have to teach this lesson old man!? TWTR bull flag AGAIN!!!
This is the way
BLNK is super autistic
It was too high man it needs to go back to 40s. NIO should always be above it
I mean, there's nothing really to research.  The fact is you can exercise options up until 5:00 eastern, assuming you have a decent broker and can get in touch with them or exercise yourself on their platform.

So for example if you're holding 1 contract TSLA $500 call expiring today, and TSLA closes at $499.99 during regular market hours but goes up to $510 after hours, you can short 100 shares AH at $510, cover by exercising your option and then capture $1000 of value instead of letting the call expire worthless.
Thanks, I'll move this there
thank you for your service
It just dropped, good time to go in?
BALY by it before close and thank me later
You make my tiny brain hurt
Zoom going up due to CDC travel restrictions and earnings hype?
PLTR calls and my GME shares rebounding.  I felt the same because I could’ve made more on PLTR than I did, but you’ve gotta trust your gut dude.  It can always go the other way.  And most of the time, it does.
Most favorite nation rule? That’s a 4th grader’s essay title

It's not red. I made the most ever in one day today with calls
We tested resistance 3 times today couldn't do it we dippin with extra dipping dots
Least he admitted to losing lol 😂 finally
It’s gonna be tremendous
Pfizer is a piece of shit when it comes to options. Could be in the green but I bet there are 1000 better trades to make
I absolutely agree. Quite literally half the people here in the UK voted for our PM because of the strongman crap.

Interesting...
no i'm talkin about EV stock with no cars
Womp womp
Why I chose APPLE over BABA yesterday?
Aye, most of my calls (by $ spent) are april to capture that.  It is looking like we may not have to wait that long now though!
SPI
you going to hold ZM over the weekend?
same here and tdoc
This isn’t a red day... wait until a real red day

That was in October or September
Buying ACB is a fools game
Wow what’s the news on BABA? Is it just going up because it’s been down for so long? Might buy 11/27 300 calls.
[deleted]
I’m green due to EVs
I don’t have any positions and I didn’t say it should drop. Just asked what the thoughts are behind these plays.

I can understand xpeng trickling down but anyone selling NIO at the price it’s at is a fucking mouthbreather lmfao. Poor fools
Just loaded up on 50 SPY $350 11/23 puts. Im ready for this 3pm selloff

Im also ready to pussy out at 3:50 if im wrong
I've been in at 2.50 with 3$ call options going to get out at 5.50 and leave some extra money long term I think it will go to at least 5 definitely I was thinking 6 maybe January.
[deleted]
I think I saw it was on Jalopnik they had an auto expert tear down a couple of Chinese Evs. To be clear, I don’t think this company is even in the same sector as Tesla or competing at all. 1st of its in China so completely different regulatory environment and idk if they even have ev credits there.

I don’t invest in TSLA so I wasn’t aware they made any money off ev credits, how does that work?
There should be a drink called, "The Stop Loss"

CIIC BQCK FROM THE DEAD
I’m sure. What was your lucky break?  I pulled out early from trades that could’ve got me going.
Lol on my long holds they're all red for the most part
Selling everything to go into GME calls. My faith is renewed
Took enough to profit. Let enough ride now expiring worthless. Less profit but. Had to test the thesis, brother.
Anybody think this thing will belly up to 368 next week?
selling all my chinese stocks the second NIO goes red
Kinda bs if you ask me
Webull cash account use for daytrades ain't that bad thinkorswim is great too
Lmfao
Yessir!  Stocktwits has an awesome guy tracking online orders (sequential order numbers).   It is looking like they will average around 75k online orders per day on the website.  I see gamestop going to 40 within a year with or without cohen....but if Cohen takes over this thing is going vastly higher than that.
you can you tell us your moves before you make them?
Peace out spy
sector rotation out of spy into CRSR PLTR and BABA
Only after hours... it’s the same story every day
PalanTEAR 😢
Chances PLTR ends at 19
Blimey mate might as well go ye teeth then
Hope you’re right
IM GOING TO CRY
That’s what I’ve got. Let’s get those gains!
5 18c 11/27. let’s goooooooo
Too many words. Biden will be great for PLTR is all I needed to see.
Red days are boring and gay as fuck idk how bears enjoy this wackass shit
18.78 here, I'm pretty stupid
Really... I was up 11% on the day 30 minutes ago and now I’m gonna fade to red...
BABA 52 wk high 319 guys

I think it was right after Jpow spoke and it went from up 1.5 to down 1.5%
And he fucking walked out. Dude was driving in racing speeds, redid the neighborhood landscaping, took the phones out, sent modern molotovs flying inside people's houses and a fucking tire through a second floor window. All while high as fuck. 

*And fucking walked out*
Yeah, when I hit send on that comment, I was already too late
Thoughts on Pfizer calls?
I’m gonna pay you $100 to fuck off
Should have this morning
Very Cool, Very Legal EV dump
Spyagira didn't work today.
S&P tanking on trump speech.  Must be a lot of pharma in there
Should i sell my BALY calls if their deep in the $ rn?
A lot of people buy it, though. The fact that you can see through it doesn't means everyone can.

i swear to god i’m red every fucking friday
friday EOD dump very bullish for monday
these are numbers that no one has ever even contemplated.
My plays for next week:

BABA 275 c 11/27
SQ 210 c 11/27
NVDA 550 c 12/4
AMD 90 c 12/24

I plan on entering right before close today. Any thoughts?
they bought
One more thing on amd chips. Local distributor i have an account with has thousands on order.... and even more back orders already outstanding. 

They did well and demand is high. Not an AMD fan boy or anything but it's actually time to tell your friends that they're idiots if they buy intel. There is absolutely no reason not to go Ryzen. 

That, plus their vid cards finally giving nvda a run for their money + lockdowns.

Calls calls calls.
Maybe that’s why eurapoor
Trump is like the crazy ex-girlfriend of the stock market. It dumps every time he speaks.
All these EV’s this week have been crazy. 

But ELIO today 😂😂😂 What.The.Fuck.

316%
LETS GOOO HIMX
So did the PS4 and Xbox One
BABA sellers dead and gone, passing the moon and headed to mars
no day trades left so holding everything over the weekend.  really hope XPENG holds and TSLA gaps up.
ACB...lol
What leaps you got?
I’m with Tastytrade, so like $4 to open & &0 closing cost. Plus, the put was $30.
PLUG was my free share when it was worth $4. I sold it right away though...
Maybe he'll concede with GA official.
I regret only that I chickened out and bought only 3 265c baba calls at the dip
[deleted]
Just sold My 100 Corsair contracts for a nice $5 gain on each contract thank you for the tendies daddy

Fuck, you’re stupid.
Baba blows pass $270...all aboard before we hit 300.🐂🐂

This.  The IV is insanely good for this.
Does anyone else remember a few months ago when SPY dropped 3% from 2:50 to 4? All the days are blending together now, so I don't know when that was or why.
Paper. Fucking. Hands.

Wtf is solo
You don’t have to sell. Personally and I’m no expert I see more downside than upside for amazon. They have a lot of their growth priced in,and they aren’t gonna do shit in black Friday sales. So what’s gonna come first Amazon is gonna grow into its PE? Or is Joe Biden’s administration go on the attack and either raise taxes on them, or break them up. I’d argue the latter. Trump hated jeff Bezos, but republicans would never let him go after amazon. Biden will with support of democrats and I don’t know any constituents on the right who would complain. The senate absolutely would protect him, but not the people. It would be a populist position to attack amazon.

XPEV wyd lol
CCL gotta die, hoping the downwards momentum continues with share dilution next week
Bought my first call. Feeling like a palatard right now
I bought 100 shares at 8.70 but also sold a December 12.5c at the same time for 200

Effectively loweres my share price to 6.70, and by December either it moons past 12.5 and I make +$580, or it tanks and I keep the premium and DCA into 100 more shares
I didn't buy any thinking resistance would be $240 like last time.... FECK
I respectfully disagree but I do see it from your point of view. I really don't think most of the EO in the last couple weeks really have much to do with what the GOP wants so I don't see it as much of a political leverage. Trade and international repairs will be one of the very first thing I believe Biden will try to tackle to steer the nation into his Green New Deal in his first 100 days which will include him undoing Trumps tarrifs and trade restrictions,
yep same buddy, so fucking hard
UTZ is my state brand and I’m brand loyal, why didn’t I slutz for it?
damn sold some of my baba 11/27s at 270 still holding leaps but that would have broken my record for 1 day tendie accumulation
I haven't researched that.  Some quick hints what to look up?

Your drive has about 650 gigs free.  The primary games like cod take 100-125gigs each.  You can have 5 games total on your drive (maybe less if they require allocated space for patches).  You cannot use external hard drives to store PS5 games (though you can for PS4 games I believe).

Also, depending on your provider, you may have a fee if you go over a certain data useage.  The only one available in my area would charge me $20 bucks to download one game if I was over my data limit (a data limit I can't increase). I live in a shitty state, but the second largest city....so this isn't the boondocks.

They have revenue share for all digital purchases/subscriptions made on xboxes (new and used) they sell. They have this with at least one other partner but we don't know who.  They are pivoting into more of a focus on peripherals etc.  Think of them as a gaming focused Best Buy going forward

If you change this to "I'm going to buy MORE when it's cheaper" than you're in good shape.

I mean everything mooned when Biden won bc there was more hope for another stimulus but yes either way Biden will be great for PLTR.

I’m personally holding cash rn, I really expect another crash within the next two months. Word just came out today that Mnuchin is ending key emergency fed programs and I have a feeling Trump is gonna try to fuck things up for the Biden administration as much as possible on his way out.

BABA still under 300 boys! Get in now. Holding 300c March!
Do people not realize that $270 for BABA is still heavily discounted?
God amzn bid/ask spreads werent this fucking wide a couple months ago. I swear it's me, the mms and the etf managers doing the shit volume on this.
From your lips to gods ears.
Remember when baba was trading in the 300s? Jump in retards.
(More) PLTR calls or FCEL puts?
My ZM PTON JKS disagree with you
The meat at Arby’s is liquid when it arrives at the restaurant. Comes in a bag, it solidifies in the freezer/fridge
I didn't want to use a daytrade and probably should have. Do we think it'll continue running the next few weeks? Seems like a relatively fresh play but I'm hoping it's not just a PnD.

SPY IV is so low. Want to see it up bigly
Sometimes you crave a beef n cheddar man, best laxative there is
I guess PLTR decided it wants to trade shares via carrier pigeon ?
lmao this response haha
How the fuck are you going to shit down restaurants again without stimulus help
knowing my luck, my TSLA weeklies will go ITM AH :)
no resistance, was being held at 271 the 100 day ema but it broke theough, straight to 300 eom
LOL you don't stay away from a bubble are you retarded? You jump the fuck on the insane growth of these companies and take profit along the way. If you "stay away" you're going to completely miss out on one of the greatest rises ever. When it starts to fall just get out. It's not like you have to ride it back down all the way to lower levels than where you started.
That’s the point....anyway made a 25% loss this week instead booking my 30% profits earlier. Will stay away from this rigged stuff
Welcome to options trading.
Id sleep better if it ended green. But im not tripping on it
My only regret is not buying a little more Baba in the 250s.

He’s swimmin in bitches
I have no idea if it is going to dump, but if it does, it will happen at like 3:30. Or 3:50.
Does BABA even have a resistance between now and 285??? Or are we just mooning over the weekend
i think mr market maker wants to have this shit pinned at 357.5
We need to ban anybody who is cheering on a stock like it's a fucking little league game.
Chances of CRSR holding over the weekend?
You'll be good.
Convince me this isn't an astrological phenomenon.

Everyone has been saying to get in on BABA. They went down on no news directly related to them. There's still time to get in. It should be at 300.
Yes
Lmaooo
Date and expiration?
I am sorry to flood with questions but could you tell me what exactly is a dip? How much does the stock have to go down for it to be a dip?
I’m hoping you’re right, I might exercise and add the extra shares, in for some already with 18 avg cost right now. Hoping for $150 by end of ‘21
any LI 40c past dec
Haha don’t blame you. Short week next week so good for selling calls to have theta work for you. Their premiums are so high right now too
I am an exhibitionist, so it makes me super hard. I'm all the fucking way in
I wish I knew. Think about how many fucking boomers out there haven't spend a dime on travel this year and are going to upgrade their phone. China is back to normal economy wise. The Santa Claus rally in this name is going to make PLTR gains look tiny.

They only have 6 employees. That limits the number of people who can make this go tits up.
Rationale?
Ban
IM BUYING A CHICKEN POT PIE
FB is green!
It’s a pump and dump retard get into $FSR for a real EV swing play. On a red day currently should bounce next week.
I sold  at 10:30 cos I got scared lmfao
Let's go BABA, 271 broken!
FDs?
It's really not a terrible idea if you invest in very safe things over a long term.
what does that even mean ?
Delet
Nah this thing going back to 82 like clockwork
Yo can we get a fucking tesla rally into close ???
We’re businessmen doing business which is none of her business wait why are you packing your bags why are you leaving
Proof of positions or ban
Today gay AF
I do play around sometimes in my individual account. Threw a couple hundred bucks at Tesla last year and 4xd my money. Bought net in the 20s and sold in the 50s. But I only do that with spending money that I have leftover, not my actual investing money.
FUBO
I see where you're coming from, since they did just get approval to fly the MAX again, but it's simply not enough. -🌈🐻 and proud.
GET UR BABA CALLS BROKE RHE 100 EMA ONLY UPP
Went with  **PTON Jan15'21 140 Call**  , its fuckin printing already
Your new to this aren’t you
none, analysts tend to fuck up mysteriously when it benefits the firm they work for
50 for 19.58 let's go
Just got back to even for the year...  feels good.
I FUCKING LOVE YOU BROTHER, BUYING MODEL S MONDAY
AYRO, you come back, only green dildos, no red
Good call...
Y’all are acting like pltr is down 2% from how much you guys are saying buy the dip smh.
Bubbles freeze in the winter
fair enough
Me and all my homies hate Roblox
This guy litters
PLTR lives matter.
That's interesting, not agro dude. Who tore down the car? I mean this is the shit that makes investing in this area difficult. You don't know if they are making cars at a lose simply because they can make money through green credits.
I think I'm gonna jerk off into a cup and freeze it so my grand kids can have my kids.
Why does everyone think baba will rocket soon? There last earnings were disappointing if anything. Xi can fuck jack ma more at anytime. Not to mention they sell fucking garbage.

What’s the thoughts on this thing rocketing back? I’m not seeing it
Glad to see we are all on the same page 😂

Gold had a bit of rough early/mid week but maybe it will have a power hour to finish the week strong.
And... sold out in all stores. In minutes, honestly. And this is in-store.
I’m expecting it to stay around the 50’s that’s why I’m selling calls but just in case it moons again I’m selling far out the money calls to collect premiums
InB4 Bull celebrate blowing a giant lead on the week
Is it dipping? -> Yes

Is it not dipping -> No
Baba breaking out!
BABA GOING STRAIGHT UP NOW BROKE THE 100 EMA LETS GOOOOOOOOO
At this point I'm not buying any more January.  Grabbing a few Dec 18th 15cs because we either pop after earnings (around the 8th) or probably not until march ER. But if you do go january, 15c is solid.  For April I'm running 12 through 25.  I'd suggest ones around 20c though.

&#x200B;

Understand that you may be underwater on these for a little bit if we have drops in the meantime (normal for GME).  You have to be willing to go Diamond hands.  I have jan/april calls that were -70% at one point and are almost break even again.  I don't think we go down again like we did in the 15/16 crash (and especially not as far as we dropped), but its always possible.
BABA lotto calls worth holding over the wknd? Thinkin bout gettin in but it seemed flat as fuck all week
i cri evertym
Feeling better about LTHM today?
I need a $1000 leap play
Lol it really depends on where you live. I’m in SF. A chain gym like 24 is $30 a month. A private specialized gym is gonna be $100 month minimum. There are a ton of people who pay $200 for equinox.

Also a bunch of tech companies offered wfh stipends and fitness credit. My last company gave every $1k a year to spend on fitness related equipment. I spent it on an Apple Watch and sneakers. 

My friend who works as TWLO got 1k to use for any WFH needed things like a desk monitor etc. She got a Pelaton bike.

[HAVEN’T EVEN BEGUN TO PEAK](https://youtu.be/PrxJJv_Za6M)
Thoughts on UVXY 14c 11/27?
I did yesterday. I’m so bad at this lol.
LOW is stuck in a pretty tight range for the last couple days, hoping to see a breakout in the coming weeks so my Jan calls can turn a profit
yep
FCEL just keeps going up.
How do you explain a spike like that? Is it hype or is it actual valuation? 

If it's just hype it'll spike down as fast as it did up.
Usa number one
Doubt it, was just there the other weekend, they have it down to a system
Gov contracts, good ceo. Huge growth potential. Soros is a bitch
Thank you, Spy! Very Cool!!
AMD all tuckered out from its move yesterday. I would load up for Monday. Rotation back into tech.
yep
Looks like VAQTF
Volume on the day 200.....
I want it to be flat/kangarooish and then I want it to do one of those rocket launches like the one from Monday AH.
You guys need to get some GME shares. Squeeze is coming feat. Cohen and Burry. Almost 300% short position. Shorts have been shorted it’s insanity. It’ll rocket in the coming weeks
Post proof of your yolo or don’t post at all. Stop ruining the sub you fucking ultraretards
How much G
Bagholdin my 11/20 25C 🤡
AAPL
Y’all said this was gonna dump. So that was a fucking lie.
$2 or 0.05?
Is $23.25 entry for blnk a bad move?
LETS GOOOO BABA BROKE THE 100 EMA CALL HOLDERS  WE’RE GOING TO 300 COME HUG ME RIGHT NOW YOOOOOOO
New contract with the Army, fuck ton of revenue for the year. Great customer rendition and Still plenty of growth potential

A gallon of bleach to drink
Wrong
Real as saying I'm not a virgin.
I got January calls 21 strike
Pump just to dump.
They just don't want to be on the wrong side of Skynet once it becomes sentient
Baba on that “no means yes” vibe
I fr fr thought pltr were those animals that gave the Chinese covid. Turns out those are pangolins.
what to pump\*?
Lol we shall see
lots of people exclusively trade SPY.
**BABA 12/18 CALLS ARE SIZZLING HOT RIGHT NOW**
Yeah.
Don’t have one I’m not interested. Amazon has garnered more bad will than good and will be a target of politicians especially in this administration coming up. Why would I buy here with a PE of 91 and thinking they’re gonna grow so much that it will come down significantly in five years.
You get what you pay for I guess
KNDI 03/19 16c

Buy that dip baby, she's goin to the moon!
They just see the line going up; no one has any idea what they do
People pay 1200 for a iphone or 2000 on classes... there’s a big market for this and lockdowns have very little to do with its demand, it just sped it up.

Even without a lockdown these guys will be selling more bikes than they can produce.
I put a little less than 25% of my initial account into $35c 1/2022. I'm hoping for a Mars Mission for PLTR in the next year
What are you buying for the weekend?
COME ON BABA BREAK THIS 100 EMA ONCE IT DOES WE’RE GOING TO 295
TSLA will probably go up given that they have had a continuous upward trend since joining S&P 500
Any plays you recommend for over the weekend?
Agree
PLTR 20 when?
PLTR is initiating a full blown KODK moment
The only sure thing right now seems to be RGB fans and keyboards
Lots of liquidity mostly I think
Should I buy more PLTR? Genuine question
0 min*
I SAID IT YESTERDAY I'LL SAY IT AGAIN TODAY. NFLX CALLS!!!!
How retarded am I?
Literally sold BABA calls for a loss today
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Okay
Need to really break out to 272 before the rocket absolutely takes off
The day before you decide to buy calls
Deep itm debit spreads today expiration, free money?
Why not both? I have my boomer account and a play account. My play account is 4x ytd and that's because I went safe and not full retard. Could have been more.

Just bought a few hundred shares of IPO. It’s the perfect diversified memefolio
Bulls don’t surf! 🏄
Don’t do it
There are few things more satisfying than selling a put for a shitload of money and then watching it expire worthless
So I don’t know shit about pltr. Why is everyone so confident in it?

What kind of miracle are you retards expecting in the next week?
Lmao
cHyNa   😂
Serious, why is there so much excitement and comments about SPY everyday?
I wrote this in another thread, but here is my prediction: 


I'll be buying anything under $20 I can afford. I'm waiting on the Covid response to be transferred over to Biden's team. That's when we will find out PLTR will be essential to the response and boomers start treating it like Zoom, bringing it up to the triple digits by December 2021. We threw 2 trillion at Covid this year, tax payers will cough up anything needed to stop it, including paying whatever PLTR asks. Once we do it, other countries will want it also. By 2022, PLTR will be well known by all due to Covid and other shadey contracts will follow. By 2023, the reptilians will reveal themselves.
way more!

They both suck - can’t prescribe narcotics
Yes
i'm making money on CRSR and NIO. Let me know when you hit $20. not gonna be next week guaranteed. So why you holding still?

Do you think the vaccine news is enough to correct ZM's stock? Maybe short selling candlesticks when the news drops would be a better idea.  Thank you for your input.
Pltr is acting like rkt.
Baba is safer
Yes
You fucking idiot
How much did you invest?
20 EOY minimum

AYRO calls Monday are either a really bad idea or really good...hmmm..
Right here holding strong
Be real. Is PLTR going to pass 20 this year?
Sheeeeit I'm only run of the mill degenerate, not actually retarded

It hasn't been inflationary yet because there is only so much crap you can buy off the internet and fill a property with. At some point inflationary spending has to come from travel and services. When the lid comes off of lock down is when inflation will rise.
Your mom would love that
PLTR will rise again
Breh its doin that rn
lmaoooooo u not make money on it salty boi?
Just hold.
Ew he’s Canadian what the fuck (I’m Canadian btw).

how many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man ?
Twitter calls 😘😘
What would your entry point be
Too late. I'm ALL IN.
WSB Live comments is life.
You ever been on azure cognitive services and tried to look through their deprecated documents 2 merges old where no one monitors the GitHub because it’s CSR’s and not the engineers taking questions. PLTR is a polished gem for UI in the big data processing field. Long PLTR
That's why I did it
That’s why it mooned after the weekend Biden won.
Holy shit BABA is past 270, we have rocket fuel again.
Two weeks ago I wanted to buy some AAPL. Glad I did not. Most boring stock ever.
is this fr the baba break out? tf?
I mean, he did lose 3BN in one day.
I intend to hold forever
Dump
[removed]
Yes. Lockdowns on the weekend and won’t get FDA approval for vaccine until December
30 min till fated direction
PLTR = for sure tendies

BLNK = maybe
Torn if i should continue holding these aapl shares. I've sold the $118 calls expiring today. $118.00 + the $.80 premium = $118.80. Currently costing me around $.20 if i wanna buy the calls back and keep the shares. My average share price is $119.
Ayro may have been a bad call
True. Thanks bro
I'm not working rn I'm only studying but I have a decent amount of money saved. I'm not expecting to be a millionaire but hopefully as many G's I can make I'll be happy haha. Big Bank by Big KRIT will be bumped in my car later today lmfao

I went 357p 12/07. Feels weird to be atm
Bruh I think we pretty much agree. No need to be so aggro. I don’t think Tesla is a money printer I don’t even have positions in tesla. At the same time, auto experts have torn down the 5k car and they have no idea how any profit is made on it. I should have said that originally. That’s why I said Tesla is making way more profit than them. I think the percentage is higher for Tesla. 

I wasn’t trying to pump Tesla, more like shit on that Bloomberg article saying it’s a Tesla killer
drugs be going down.....prices that is

14:30 start, so in about an hour it will kick off lol
Pltr gang wya
Good check on my $ 0.01 spy 365c
50%
100% do
Hearing some people saying TWTR might move bigly next week. Any catalyst as to why?
WSB pump thread
It's doubled in two weeks... How's that not easy?
You know it’s been around for about 20 years, right? 

It’s a speculative stock, that’s all.
i'll never understand u kids and wanting to zoom up ur dang computer. I've had my Windows computer since 2003 and it runs word and office and minesweeper just like the day i bought it. Oh well, guess u can't teach an old new tricks ha ha. Thanks, 

Bart
Haha nice one you retard
I was told there would be a news conference about drugs. Anyone know where to watch?
To the retard who called me desperate for pumping the 11/27 TWTR gap up play. I'm up 75% on these calls.

Suck on deez nuts

Hope some of you got in, room all the way up to 50.


Next plays, BABA and RUN oh and PTON
Such a terrible stock
how about 10K orders from UPS? does that count
Since September... 20
Most boring day for spy in awhile
Elon woke up
It would make orders harder to fill right?
BABA broke resistance. End of day pump incoming
Good ol reliable PLUG.
 Ermm where the fuck you got that from? The air industry is in the mud for the next year?

> sumo logic 

Isn't too late to hop in!
It’s actually pretty affordable because Affirm let your do interest free month payments over a 3 years. That comes out to $70 a month including the sub over three years. People pay up to 2/300 for a gym membership. The only people who can keep a PTON are people who own homes large enough to keep a bike in.

If you actually read a recent article by Affirm, they state that a bulk of their revenue is from PTON.

70 a month is peanuts.
I don't know much about AES. I do know there is only one Tesla. Tesla is a once in a century type of company.
Do you have the link ....
The driver fled on foot after the accident......

Innocent people don't flee the scene.
What kind of leap position are you taking?
Why is the IV dropping on Baba? Need that back in the .39-42 range
Bummer. Sorry about that. The ‘beauty’ of options we all get to bask in.
More like Theta de*Gay*, am I right? LOL!
Damn is amazon gonna drill, drill soon? 

Past 5 days it’s seen larger outflows, and today it’s had the most outflow compared to the rest of week
All options
Are my TSLA calls going to be safe next week?
not just ev, veg ev 
lmao
so this week was EV... what's next week?
Elon just snorted like 10 viagras 

LETS GOOOOOO
shaddup back there
Better pump that number up. $60 is only scratching the surface. It’s going $100+ for sure
A month or two, til they get things with Chinese regulators sort out on Ant.
PLTR moon mission please
not happening
The more I looked into it, I realized that was a decent accretive acquisition that opens them up to US markets.

I want to see more from management though. This company deserves more hype than CGC.

Why not all
Spy do somethinggg
My palantir puts are printing nicely.
2 weeks is my opinion I’m no professional tho. Just someone with BABA 300Cs 01/15
I'd say the 4/16 calls are a better bet. They're just starting phase 3 trials. No guarantee you get data back by 1/15.
Bought 25x 19C 11/27 today, up around $400, expecting a lot more
100%. Still over sold
Buy AYRO dip
Hahaha I'm a retard too clearly
Look at the chart now 😉
PLTR order book just looks like it wants to get run over to $19
wHY DID i BUY PLTR shares
Boys, I feel a disturbance in the Force.   


I think Palantir is misspelt: it is actually Palpatine.   


The dark side that be.
I was on the fence this morning too. So I sold my  4 23c 1/15/21 for only a $20 gain. To just stop worrying about it but just bought more shares in the dip with the money.
Good luck w that pal

I have watched calls i sold yesterday go up way beyond what I had.
This is the type of thing I needed to see after buying AMD calls earlier today.
Only the mods
Good! Yes it does count!
I know. The vaccine pump fucked me last weekend because there were a lot of new cases/lockdowns. 

Feel like the vaccine pump is hopefully pricing itself in by now, and rise in cases could become news. But who knows lol
You got any those 55 11/27?

Bout to drop a fad wad
What's the original video?
My whole EV and Power watchlist is up average of 75% on the week. Meanwhile I’m still holding shares of AAPL..
There's no reason to bring your mom's boyfriend's family into this.
PayPal lives between $189-$193
Great fire!!! It will go up
Lol a Biden administration would be the best thing for PLTR
It’s going to take some good news pump to get there, who knows when that happens
No, I made a comment yesterday giving my price target for it to be $100 within 2-4 Months for the winter season due to stay at home behavior and great guidance from their first earnings call. Get in before 50.
The t33po portfolio: 

- Face value - decently profitable and on a broad uptrend

- Reality - a collection of epically stupid moves bailed out repeatedly by meme FD's

+300% on ZM zero days save the month yet again.
What do you mean?
Yes, which is exactly what OP is doing.
please take that profit and get off of cricket
PINS week chart looks fucking stunning.
Baba calls worth buying ?
Whole market is doing that
This is REALLY good information, thank you. But, this is a vaccine news play. I don't really care if Zoom is making money, just that people are seeing the vaccine release and panic selling their extremely overvalued stock.
You'll be using the \[GAINZ\] flair soon. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
baba
You mean 22c 1/15/21 are gunna make me richer? Noice
probably heavy competition with ddog and splunk combined with a lack of catalysts compared to ddog.
So glad got out of my SNAP shorts this week. So fukin boring, almost forgot I had them. 🥺
cant decide between baba tesla or zm as my next moonshot
GreTat!
Idiot. He is referring to offsetting losses against gains to lower your tax liability. Once you sell out of the position, you will realize the short-term gain, which is then taxable as ordinary income.
I got no daytradddeessssss
can i ask why you bought that high?
PLTR shares and 1/15/21 contracts gonna get me a 6 figure net worth at 20
You would want puts
Opinions on how long it’ll take baba to get back to $300 ??

Sorry you lost- hope you win and we win on this one.

You can buy spy also...
Yea use your 2 thumbs same time
everyone needs 2 doses minimum. there's still no data on how long it lasts, could be 2x a year till its eradicated.

so could need billion+ just for the US that would need 100m a month with large portions of the populous unvaccinated for 6-9 months from now

Shorting BKD and DHC with all of the spike in COVID.  They have way higher operating expenses as well as much lower occupancy as a result of the virus overall, and with it spiking in the country, Q4 is going to be pretty bad.  Expecting a slow bleed back down.
Palantir ffs. How have you not found Palantir yet?

Look up Peter Thiel and the other companies he is involved in. (PayPal, Facebook, SpaceX)

Look up Alex Karp and ask yourself if you think he will build up a cult following.

Look up Project Maven.

Look up their q3 earnings report.

Read between the lines on what Soros said about Palantir. He is afraid of how powerful they are becoming.
Same here. Down!
Eat dick.
Can I buy calls on WSB?
At this point I just want my money back

is it just SPY? or all options
I'm so sleep deprived today my eyes match my portfolio. Red as a mofaka.
He picked Military companies (BA 200-300 lockheed) and tech companies (tesla 2k). 300-1500 is random but the point is that PLTR is hard to gauge in terms of value because theyre growing like a tech company
Tesla 🔥🔥🔥🔥

You're the definition of retarded
Your outlook on money will change quickly and you’ll feel the same in a few years with 100k as you do now with 1k. Just a matter of time and consistency.
Shares?! Get the fuck outta here with that bs. 

This is WSB pussy, ain't nobody in here trying to make $300.
Yup, meant to start in a minute or so...
People have been asking this daily since last week and it’s literally gone nothing but up
1/15/21 22c
$100 by late december
Pls post another today😢
If you search red in google images you can see blue
Buy PLTR at 18
I do have a serious question though. Why do you guys talk so much about weak volume on SPY? An ETF goes up based on the stocks that it tracks going up, so why would the buy volume on the actual ETF matter? Is it just to show that people support the stocks that it tracks?
These 0dte would be so much nicer if robinhood didn’t have pdt restrictions
Hurts seeing this rally after my baba 310 calls expire worthless 
About 49k loss smh

Wow, rotation out of everything I own and into whatever everyone else has, apparently.

This is true every broker will do this for you once

Meant I'm even. No profit/loss, should've said that better.
Two Finger Tequila will help u navigate them, as well.
If your EV stock doesn't actually have cars, you probably gonna get rolled
stfu i remember you were one of the wsb shills. ciic isn't gonna move, everyone heard the news about the merger and price didn't move. there's no more new news until ticker changes in Q1 '21. please stop sharing with us you have no money.

I don't know why you're being downvoted. Anyone with half a brain knows if you invest $5,000, you can't lose anything. $5,001 or $4,999 is playing with fire though, avoid that.

Looks like algos are taking the wheel to kill options today. Updating my forecast to close near open price today, AH dump and red Monday after a morning pump.

PH sell off still isn’t out of the question though, but don’t bank on it.

Yesterday it appeared to hit the bottom and is undervalued
Wait
It's hitting 27 before Christmas.
I’ve been buying shares lately. So much easier.
What are scratchers?
I have simply watched CRSR move up 40% in 5 days, cool lol
I'm selling puts
sell and buy an ATM longer expiration IMO.
Not retarded but that’s a lot of money to lock up in something that isn’t going to move a lot in the short term.
I knew what pubes is. Just wondering who raised you
AMD chips selling like crazy. Local store showed 5600x stock an hour ago... was debating buying one... down from 5+ to 3 in minutes. Now down to 1. Meaning: all gone.

Can't you just switch your account from margin to cash only
owning microsoft is like putting money in a bank. YOU WILL NEVER GO WRONG LEAVING  MONEY THERE. Don't let these loser with minimal daily gains of $50 throw you off your longterm goals. Play the earnings that is coming up in end of month/early December. I think this stock will be $220+, it just released the new xbox and its sold out everywhere.
same either way for me
[deleted]
Y’all gotta chill on PLTR. It’s up 90% this month and 15% this week. Don’t get fussy cause you bought weeklies
i got spy puts guys your calls are safe
MMs playing games
Pinned for options today, will continue moon mission next week
u/savethisvideo
Yee i had 4 $7.5c i bought for 1.64 theyre at 5.40 now lol sold them around 2.5 but cant be mad at profit
time for anxiety to kick in  😂
long way to go lol. its the first 4% of many this month
Where do you get the 137% from?
It’s never been an issue until today. I guess it saves some people who don’t constantly manage their accounts from things expiring if they are up
357, the battleground
Not too late
Either 11/30 or 12/2. I've seen both. Idk man, price is so low comparatively I think it's got a lot of room to go up. Regardless of what they say, the vaccine and widespread distribution is a long ways away. You also have some permanent changes with remote work. Be careful trying to outsmart the market. Not gonna tell you what to do, but I will say I've lost a lot of money betting against meme stonks.

Full disclosure I have a lot of money riding on ZM through the next week, so my perspective may be skewed.
old
How is it as compared to tdoc for doctors ?
Same. VXX options destroyed me this year even though I bought at Rona lows. We have some potential obvious false-flag spikes, like a final-fit trump throws, partial lockdowns, vaccines being broken etc.

Looking at the stores how do I buy calls on toilet paper
Good news= stocks go down. Bad news=stock goes up. Idk why, but it always seems to be that way. If they furloughed 3/4 of their employees TSLA would rocket to 4K in a day.
at least there r no expiry  😂
LFG!!! Love seeing this mentioned in here

Because it ran up 20% this week and $50 is new resistance
Yeah, you're probably right. I think this vaccine will correct the price though, even if for just a month.

Subscription is $40/month and is required for classes regardless. But you can share that cost with everyone who physically uses your bike so if you have several roommates you can split it with them. The people who delivered my Peloton said you can have up to 50 accounts on one bike which would make them great for apartment buildings.

Don’t you dare. Scared money don’t make money
I’m guessing you didn’t like Webull because of the bid/ask spread not being averaged out instead of Max bid(the reason I tell people to learn b/a)?            

Webull actually has quick transaction times, have aftermarket exercise times(if you have the money to buy 100 shares), and has full US premarket(4:30 et) and most of aftermarket trading(up to 7:30et).
It was up to 135 last earnings even with the delivery delays.  Keep waiting.
Yes
Please buy the calls I’m selling
Biden wouldn't undo any executive orders quickly related to economic stuff because he won't have any information to know whether or to what extent any are appropriate, and some will probably stick for awhile because then Biden can then use their removal as political negotiation tools.

Biden and his team will be flying blind for awhile---anything they do quickly will be focused entirely on a domestic agenda like student loans and whatnot.  International trade will be impacted by whatever Trump does right at the end for awhile.

I know SOLO was up a lot more, but a +10% day is hardly "destroyed"

AYRO is still like +30% lol
More like 490 at close
AYO NIO WTF
I don't think earnings can save the effect of the news. When are ZM earnings anyhow? Is it before the vaccine drop? Because I think ZM has long-term feasibility, just not at this price. Playing earnings isn't the way.
It will be high $19’s or $20 by Monday morning

to what price u think
I don't play Roblox so is it popular and addictive like GTA online & Fortnite? Are the players retardedly that addicted? Is the publisher just print money with this shit? Also, what prevent the players from simply moving onto the next big thing? Doesn't seem to have a moat.
What kind of gay monopoly crap is that? If it's not green fucking burn it.
Ayro is bogus EV
WPRT looks promising and still dirt cheap
UVXY a buy going into next week?

Got fucked on vol options too many times so I'm thinking about going in on shares here.
VXX
K shaped recovery. Lots of people are still making money, but now have nothing to spend it on. PTON took a huge hit from vaccine news, so I anticipate another run up.
LIIIII you bitch. EVs are all bitches and don’t put out.
nice. air bnb busy alienating half their potential cust base, so theres that to consider....

I could see this.  Someone asked about what option to play over the weekend and I thought I'd go BABA shares rather than any option (even on BABA)
No of Retards on this sub are unreal.
Tell that to the hindenburg
Goddamnit, the restrictions keep you from placing day trades, not all trades. Change your retarded strategy for 3 months or deal with dogshit UI's, kinda your call. You can also try asking RH to let you out of jail, I've heard the first one is sometimes free
positions or down.
The pussies sell now the real players hold for green monday
How, please lend me your secrets
better hope the dump comes early.

If you don't ride the EV hype you are retarded and don't belong here.

Did the EVs run outta juice?!
you are aware this is r/wallstreetbets?
I'm a newer retard. What significance does the downgrading last week hold?
Oh yeah, Nikola is a dumpster fire for sure.

I got a PLTR $23c @12/04 hopefully it pans out
Not even in the slightest. All the other SPACs have gone up 100% after going up 20%. You’ll regret not jumping on now
Gobble
Lets go! They bought Sweetwater brewing
Yeah, it's a bummer.. I'm losin' $
Yeah I sold today as my entry wasn’t that low anyway. Hope for a pullback
I truly envy those that don’t have to floss their teeth
i wonder what the next news catalyst will be that takes out of this trading range.
Buy the LIT etf. Whatever one of those succeeds is gonna need batteries.
I want calls too. But market looking scary imo
Fuck Tesla
jinxed it
My man, thinking of the people. Your awesome brother. Keep it up
If they somehow pull off vaccine fda approval, thatll be your catalyst
for sure... big government data? thats a no-brainer, im gonna keep DCA some shares until i retire, lol
they ain't yo true friends if they ain't sucking you off anyways
I came here to comment this exact sentence
How much were you down on it?
wouls love this
I’m slowly buying 12/4 amd calls
Have 10k need a play
No. Do the opposite of what this man says, OP. Yolo on everything instead of nothing.
PLTR is looping the beginning of this

#I know I said it yesterday, but this is the last week you’ll see TSLA under $500 until the next time
Give me one logical indicator of CIIC going up.
NIO sucks
positons
Someone’s getting squeezed
would be long term but heads here have memed it so its prolly gonna look like an ev stock for 6 months
I cant even imagine buying calls for any reason other than selling them
puts decently OTM and a week+ away. we are about to drop over the next couple of weeks. right? right!?
It's so boring. I have some shares but that's my "safe" play that I probably won't sell.
yeah, good for playing dips and rips
FUCKKK CIIC, FUCKKK!!!!
No problem. I don't know shit either because I'm not a financial guy at all, but I just learned all this crap by reading a lot of Investopedia and watching videos.
Now. It’s there. I bought yesterday.
Just wait until Soros, Karp, and Thiel dump the rest of their shares
days like today where AMD NVDA APPLE MSFT AMZN are all red and flat and AYRO SOLO XPEV are all crushing it make me wonder why I sit here for hours looking at this screen
so 6 months?
God damn, im never cashing out
Shares
I'm going deeper. Looking at 3/19/2021

like on < 1D chart? was just lookin at FSLY again and realize that what I thought RSI represents is not at all right lmao. was thinking of momentum as a way to time a top or bottom. stonk could continue to trend down at a slower rate and RSI would rise, still no idea what to do with that info tho lmao. shrimp futures r tha way bb

Yeah they sell it for you an hour before close if it’s expiring that day
Papa needs a new pair of shoes!
He tried lol. We would be low 300s right now if he did the Chinese stock ban he issued couple weeks ago before the election. Market doesn't care now because any executive orders will be undone by Biden. It's called the Lame Duck period for a reason.
I though RH is only profitable because of autists

Bruh I’d be swimming on pornstar pussy with lots of coke and I’ve never done either lmfaoo. 

I was thinking dropping 200 but decided to say fuck it and dropped 1K and I’m pretty happy. No fucking way was I gonna do like $5K I’d be scared to death hahah
I had gainz and needed to jump ship out of an option. I made 4K on the option and later in the day it dropped to negative so I made the right move but it cost me to become a pattern day trader.
who will lie ?
Looking forward for your analysis!
It’s tightening up on the daily. Any thoughts on it?
.35 345s for Wednesday are absolutely 10 baggers Monday
When can I buy $TLS? Not showing up for me
No way

I got fucked so hard on AMZN calls this summer. My dumbest moment 🪦
Their success is tied heavily to epacket regulations and rates. Otherwise they seem like a good bet.
No stopping this slide, hop on for a good ride down.

They won’t get approved until 12/8-12/10. FDA said so
please explain this to an e-trade trader? They make you sell at 3??
the fact that you autists think we are dumping in the final hour means we are most likely going to pump
Fuk it lets go

If someone bought the morning after I posted, they would be up about 100%. I’m up about 35% because I bought too early. Still holding though.
Somebody said they expect this to keep going on till the next earnings. Such a shame.
get ready boys, CIIC and all other ev is gonna moon over the weekend
hold for a year per inch of your dick
Welcome to the club!
“Could be” lmao ok
Good shit buddy!
Haven't held it long huh?  Couple of weeks ago not so much.  Get a real news vaccine pump and fucking yields will go over 1%.
When you try to hold out it dips, that’s why.
Oh I’m invested in CRSR, I’m just saying it’s already a lot of peoples play
actually didn't
If solar doesn’t pump next week I’ll eat a pillowcase
IV so fucking low now tho kind of worthless in selling rn
Noob.
what price do you see it going to?
Why tf is my wife in the background?
Bought them Nov 9th when there was a couple of posts going around about Lyft puts since it has gone up for 3 weeks straight and covid blah blah blah, so I went with it. Should of inversed with calls
That’s a good point, never saw it that way. So you’re saying that investors are slightly more aggressive with their trading since holding onto money is pointless and will just burn up with inflation?
😂
Sell half, see how other half plays out
What’s the play for amazon? It’s been flat for days.
If you sold you owe tax if you are from usa how much idk maybe wait and let irs figure out how much then they will send you a bill maybe

Yes but worried about another vaccine pump.
Good for you.  Glad you aren't still in it.  Up pretty big today.  I think the trend is up if you want to flip to calls.

BABA looking good for calls also.
Fuck, here we go..  January 30c I'm in.
Paid off credit card and doing a refi on the house a couple months early. It’s not much but it’s honest work.

The rich get richer by buying and owning appreciating or income producing assets for many years. Retailtards are going to stay poor by constantly jumping in and out of their assets. “I’m going to buy back in when it’s cheaper” is the ultimate sign that that guys probably a retard.
is palantir a long term or short term play?
Fuck tesla
You snooze u lose. Happens almost every time playing weeklies. Best feeling is when the opposite happens tho
I think your gains can be credited to the strategy of just "all-ing" on stocks more than the choice of stocks, and I started doing the same instead of trying to dollar cost average on the rise.

Will be doing the same and report back when I hit 1mil in a few months.
Killed it by making it go up 80%
INM Leaps are free money, going to blast off soon

Hahaha how many pubes you got?
#see YA'LL IN VALHALLA!!!
I'm about to paper hand PLTR
AAPL has been a theta delight
That’s so fowl.
People do still move into PMs as an alternative to the USD periodically, which leads to a temporary rise, but then more shorts are piled on. It appears that the dollar to PM ratio really doesn't matter, as delicious as it sounds for those of us who hold PMs, I'm sure we'd all love 100k/oz gold and 500/oz silver, but that would simply put too many USDs into the hands of foreign nations that hold lots of PMs, as well. Therefore, the price can never be allowed to rise. Banks rule the world. They are as much weapons of the US govt as our military is.
This dip is heading back to 420, I'll wait.

I am so curious why you got a 90 day restriction from RH.
We know
Should I dump my PLTR leaps at EoD? It's only gonna get worse from here
Idk but what were people expecting? It mooned for almost 2 weeks lmao. I wouldn't feel good about buying options, especially with the IV being what it is, but I'm holding my shares
Moving out! Good for you!

I see, I like this answer quite a lot. Although I can’t help but think: job unemployment numbers are still historically high compared to usual levels and economy is still down 9% from February levels.. isn’t it a bit too soon to be above 3300-level (February’s level) considering that the virus is technically not even behind us fully?

WPRT
Are you so fucking retarded that you dont even know that US govt already have initial order for 100 million doses for US only and the 20millon+ vaccination per month estimate only applies to US only. They said Americans can expect 25-30 million vaccinations each month after December. AMERICANS. Shut the fuck up if you dont know shit.
How the fuck did you do that
Good for you man!
Good man
a lot

or a little

or, potentially, none
Only like 65% needs to go to the US to achieve herd immunity by eoy next year which is likely

Disclaimer, I have positions in both, shares and calls

How much money did you lose? Positions?
Trust brother hold it. Stay at home stocks were flying up earlier and and it’s only catching on to Netflix now. IMO it was kicked off by insider trading on news off lockdowns coming up
Good luck, 50c 12/18 here because I could afford 1

Hi
la impresora de dinero hace PLTRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
No idea.  Okay fuck it. How high can this go? 10?
Ok
Why did you sell crsr
Was doing well on pton so I sold at 109$ and then proceeded to buy back in at the top. Insert high five through the face meme here.
Sup
Thanks
Chimpu?  That you?
Still takes 30 days to be effective.  As much as healthcare workers are important, I think we should immunize the top 1% of earners first as we cannot afford to lose their federal tax contributions.

This is hilarious. AYRO same thing, 890k revenue with almost 9 MILLION in losses. Stock up 125% in 2 days with market cap of 215 million. Kinda pissed I missed all these hype stocks KNDI AYRO SOLO etc
Ok so we are fucked then?

Well, I was up 200% on some TSLA calls yesterday, but held for more.  I'm now down 98%.  I'm not even retarded, I'm just *smooth*
How many of you have actually changed your lives trading? I want that for all of you. New car? House? Moving out? I wanna hear it
have to dance when the music is playing
There's only 18k people on WSB right now? Did everyone get wiped out before the election?
fridays suck
Betting against PayPal Mafia for a tiny ass company that is having a temporary moonshot and makes ugly ass cars. Sounds smort, count me in!
just dont hold positions over the weekends
Doesn’t matter you’ve made more than most of us ever will. Hell most of us won’t even come out of this shit positive
what
Can’t wait for robinhood ipo that shit is gonna rise for being the shittiest brokerage and I’m gonna have infinite calls on that shit
And now you have to hope that he'll step out of the way graciously for the next administration instead of stirring up shit globally on the way out.
Yup, but that's why you ride it up and then let others hold those heavy bags.
I can’t wait for the vaccine news on Monday. Like clockwork.
Your good. Log out. Smoke a cig, relieve yourself and come back later
[deleted]
Big tendies this week. I'm trying to figure out how it keeps going up
Sell TSLA or hold? I'm really pissed right now about to sell this bullshit american shit for some sweet orange chicken
Investors don’t care because nothing has caught up with us yet bro. It will one day, definitely not soon but one day it’ll all come crashing down. Imma bull my ass off and live like hell till that day comes
Are you me?
Jets to win afc championship, payout has to be ridiculous

C'mon baba $270 close
Children can’t understand simple multiplication, if you think they can even slightly understand stocks and options then you’re a moron. 

Giving kids stocks as gifts to hold for a decade / bonds is the best thing you can do.

Trying to have your kids enter the stock market at age 6 is setting up your kids to become gambling addicts. 

Teach your kids how to be hard working instead. Smh
BABA black sheep have you any (rockets to please blast to 290 next week).
trust the plan
No idea. Its just a used car sales company with like a dozen branches. Maybe someone left a good pair of boots in one of the cars they bought. That would justify such upward trend

C'mon Hyliion do your thing

Come on FUcking DO it!!!

#JUst Do IT!
EVs are exciting and have a bright future but this is the biggest bubble around right now.
Well, I was up 200% on some TSLA calls yesterday, but held for more.  I'm now down 98%.  I'm not even retarded, I'm just *smooth*
Why would you regret it do you hate money? Hope you picked up more on the dip
Since everyone being wild. Depending on local, if US short term captial gainsTax, bout 35% so 13K.
“The whole shitcoin mania” 

Shitcoin blew past the “mania” ATH this past week bro so idt anyone gives a fuck about that comparison anymore.

But I do see what you’re saying as far as everyone trying to search out what next EV company is going to run up. As if that’s just how it works.
Eventually it could be worth $300-$1500.
In 5 years
If TSLA dip more, should I drop $3,000 to yolo on $530c 12/24?
There’s only one way the market tanks and that is if the fda rejects the vaccine

FULL VERSION: [https://vimeo.com/453713945](https://vimeo.com/453713945) (2 hours long) watch this bro. Its the future I think.
TSLA calls or puts this weekend? I need a win
The most annoying has to be posts that start with “imagine”...
Literally any positive news related to BABA and it's going to be up 10%+
Literally made $850 since I posted this loooool
350-650 imo
its just what company they invested in or w/e
40 and 45c 12/18. It's gonna keep going up.
And thus, CRSR was introduced to the market; and the market said, “we find you undervalued”.
Thoughts on IPO ETF?
Palantir did tons of business with Obama administration, do you know who was VP when Obama was president?👀
first day pump, high chances of continuation through to monday tho?

Anyone got some good nfl bets?
The fact that we are even red after a solid red day, makes me doubt whether we gonna see 360 again this month or not
It does help because the calls won’t be exercised, but it hurts because the premiums are shit
Plz sell
TSL BOYS ASSEMBLE
I'm diamond handing my 55c 1/15's.
Eat dick
You could be me. I lost 50-80k being stubborn with my 10/16 $60 calls that were up over a quarter million net at one point.
I’m pretty excited about the $400 i made this week..It kind of makes me forget about the 15k I lost last week
That doesn’t make sense. If anything it would dump once everyone let’s go of their puts and into calls
Took profits on printing PTON & BABA calls. Holding my 12/18 MTN puts which are also printing but I think they still have a ways to go. This summer I lost $6k & I began this Fall w/ \~$1k. *S l o w l y* crawling back since. 'Til last Monday, my RH broke $2k. Today it broke $3k. **Thank God** there's finally momentum, now I won't get assigned on $ROPE.  Wondering if it's worth it to switch to 🍒Tastyworks?🤔🤔

Oh rly? I thought EUA would take a few weeks for Pfizer
The fact that it’s in the middle of a parabolic move upwards due to literally the world’s largest funds being mechanically required to buy 10-15% of the float of a $470B company in three weeks. It’s like the worlds slowest moving special situation trade and it rules

Midget loss porn incoming
Is that good or bad?
yes normally cause I could sell a bunch of contracts and then rebuy as I move down but right now the premiums are so low. Making more on my NIO covered calls at a way less risky price and I have 1/4 the shares. You need some volatility to really get good premiums.
I didn’t notice that. I will take break from wsb now to cure my terminal autism

Sentiment is pretty bearish, this shit is probably gonna explode to the upside when everyone lets go of their puts, then we'll get more stimmy/vaccine pump over the weekend.
Maybe an early selloff for the weekend?

DEATH TO SMALL CAPS
Pfizer getting FDA approved over the weekend fosho
Bought the dip. Stock is on sale right now ! Pltr 🚀
January solo puts
agreed but if both of us autists are thinking this then it most likely will pump to 360 somehow.
you sound confused
I swear some bears were even asking how many CBs we could fit into Friday on the daily thread yesterday 🤣 That cuckboy Mnuchin ain't shit compared to our glorious Godfather Jerome
Are you retarded? Not everyone wants to get vaccinated. Don’t assume that everyone will be open to vaccination. This is a country that cant even agree on mask requirements. We dont need vaccine for 250 million people
mmmm look at the chart. depends on how long you want to play leveraged miners.
This whole EV run up feels like the shitcoin mania...every tom dick harry was selling new shitcoins

Mortality is way down even though cases are up. 

It’s okay to be a 🌈 🐻 if you don’t like money and it’s okay to be scared. You’ll be okay though, just be responsible, wear a mask, and wash your hands.
You won’t
Options are only available for either December 18th or January 15th.  I think if a sell-off will happen, it won't wait until the very end of the month, but the January date gives you more time to account for any additional sell-off tied to worries about transfer of Presidential power

JPM believes in a negative Q1 GDP. The logical decision here is to buy calls.
Wednesday peak.
Getting tired of holding these PLTR calls but every time I sell something it moons the next day or two.
Realistically tho depending on stimmy talks and lockdown talks imma bail at €525
I heard a while back that the Saudi royal family was buying up CCL shares. So maybe they’re pumping it.
I’m waiting till Monday in case a dump today

Damn, was gonna buy ZM today and woke up to it up 6% already. Still looks hella bullish so I'll buy anyways I guess
That’s high....
I would say yes but we aren't drilling so I don't know.
Bought some 1 hour ago :) fucking great decision
Okay Trump
Fucking hate when I own only one contract like this, lock in NFLX tendies or wait for retest of 494?

random p&d. I got out with losses way above where it is trading now.
bought a few shares to test the waters, then sell and buy calls once they come out ;)
Yeah waste of $75 but stonks only go up so TMUS should be in 130s next week so maybe I'll make the gains back.
No worries, also I’m a buyer!
Only big moves can make it move big n’am sayin
They’re selling in the UK!??

PLTR releasing 7 plus vaccines Monday heard it hear first

When are all of you retards going to be balls deep in SBE and BLNK? You’re pumping like 10 different EV stocks, but there’s only a few EV charging stocks that have huge potential.

You better have bought the dip for PLTR. 🚀
we're at the precipice, which way will she turn...
I bought the top of XPEV Ask me anything
Umm can someone tell NVDA that it crushed earnings and that it will be a trillion dollar company once the arm acquisition goes through? Thanks
$ttcf hammer!!!!!!!
What’s your strike?
To think i almost bought tesla instead of zoom
Look at treasury yields. Why don’t investors care? Who is going to replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency?

We should’ve been levering up even more this entire time and plowing that $$$ into infrastructure
And.... he know Cohen is about 10%.  Cohen won't be pushed around so Burry trims some PROFIT.  He is probably even now and just left house money in.

Hedge managers know how to take profit. He wasn't looking for short squeeze just an undervalued company.
Pretty surprised airports aren’t enforcing it tbh
Well like most of my plays, we let it rise and rise then, watch it fall, hope it rises again and end up selling when it goes negative
It's 2020
Rsi is good I use it with vwap Bollinger bands and macd
Just chill and watch it soar next week. It had healthy growth and hasn’t reached its ceiling yet. Xpeng got overhyped and blew up too much so it will trim soon
Nope gonna be rich
Sorry, that would mean I would make a shitload of money. Therefore impossible.
It is the most annoying fucking phrase in this game.
I can’t believe I slept on blink fuck

Fuck me, xpeng is mooning like a mofo and Nio didn't do shit, fuuuuuck

Edit: so yeah, next week 60c it is my fellow consumers of tendies
Might not happen, lot of resistance at $270. More likely it closes at or a bit under $270 and moon service resumes after hours.
They will produce 20million vaccines per month starting in December. By this time next year,most of the population should be either vaccinated or given chance to do so.

EOD SPY calls for Green Monday a good move or nah?
They’ve had the contracts since the Obama admin lmao
I can tell you need to do more research. It all depends on your goals and how long you plan to hold. I place mine a few dollars out but nothing crazy. 

The more research you do, the more money you will make. You need to truly understand options to make consistent money. 9/10 people on here don’t know what they’re doing.
Looking at market cap vs. revenue and comparing it to something like Logitech. Q4 will almost certainly end with profit, so room to grow (in my opinion). I keep setting trailing stop-loss to secure profits.
Based on what?  That it’s a tinge red today?
No doubt in my mind even a little bit.
Set time from 1 day to 1 week, poof, stonks go up!

Same. I bought a single PTON call because of this guy and closed for a quick $400 today. Legend.
I’d laugh my ass off if the bears who kept getting fucked over by EVs are finally trying to change and are buying xpeng at the top right now lmao 🤡 🌈 🐻
Ignored 25% gains on an FD with plans to hold till 3pm to make my 100% but I ended up selling for 50% loss to jump on another weekly only to realize i had the chart scrolled back 2 hours and bought the actual top. Im fucking retarded.

I’m getting drunk tonight.
There’s over a billion shares in circulation
I’m fine with that I guess. My expiry isn’t until January. 97.5 call
If I played that game, I would have bought puts on XPEV at about 9:40 this morning. Because I bought calls on LI last Friday at 9:40 a.m.
But the is economy is currently 9% off of February 2020 levels. So what justifies the fact that the stock market is almost 10% above February 2020, is it simply “we survived”?
What makes you think that?
Sounds good dude

Is energy a thing again?
Once again former (and future) bear here to say if you’re not buying TSLA rn you’re insane imo
Is that the meeting with the Michigan state reps?  If so it’s possible that the reps cancelled and the Covid thing is just the story.
People who held are too powerful

Negative p/e? Just can't divided by zero ,😬
yes
what are we hoping for in power hour.... pump or dump?
I just want spy to dump is that too much to ask ?
Perhaps this is the end of their gravy train with Biden's win becoming official.  Peter Thiel is no friend of the new administration, so their gov contracts are not guaranteed now.
PLTR ATH next week $23.50. Save this.
Screw it, I'm in
I sold almost all my stocks. It shows on buying power

China is going to protect their home grown EV industry, that's how.

Also all of the existing manufacturers are burdened by decades of baggage - union deals, supply chains, poor engineering decisions, lack of software expertise and so on.

Tesla proved that the right way to build an EV is to do a ground up fresh design. The big automakers have been really reluctant to do that. The only one I know that really committed to doing it is VW, and while they had good mechanical engineers, they didn't hire the software talent needed. Now they have a ton of brand new cars sitting in lots waiting on a software rewrite.
PLTR 🚀🌚
Get your penny stock horse shit outta here
check FLUX
Come on feel the noize! Next week will be time for tendies boiz
all those words and paragraphs aside, I'm going to be hitting up my local mountain.
I want to load upon puts for nnox because their stock price is highest of all time while they’re going through a class action lawsuit for defrauding investors. This has been going on for months, but the stock price hasn’t budged. Is there something i’m missing?

What's happening to tesla? Is the stock market price going down?
I’ll watch a stock for a few weeks and if I like where it’s going, and the news surround it’s long term growth is positive, I’ll do 3-4 months out.
PLTR coming back bitch
Yes, the MM are doing everything to keep it below $13. You can see how it fights up but gets dropped down. We need to keep pushing and the squeeze will come with RC
He told me my account was only $22 😤
You need lvl 6 clearance to sell covered puts like that. I’m guessing you’re lvl 2, so your mind goes blank when you try to think how it works
Logitech is at $84 and rising as well. I know it’s not the best comparison and Logitech is much larger than Corsair but I don’t see how $55-60 isn’t in the realm of possibility for Corsair. It’s been on a tare and this bitch hardly has a red day. I keep saying maybe resistance at 25 maybe 30 but nah this bitch is cruising.
whats ur LI plays
11/27 strike?
9$ puts dec

50k each week lol
just wait till roblox ipo's and steals the max level retards and the 12 year old robinhood investor
HELL YEAH
Did you take profit or are you still in the position? If its a stock play you can get away with 0 taxes if you hold through Jan 1. 

If you did sell you still have the ability to lose it back on yolo options.  This way you don't have to worry about taxes.
Does this phenomena have a name I can google? I want to learn more about how the market reacts to open interest at a certain strike near expiration.
Ight. Fuck it. Its house money anyway. Im averaging about 17 bucks a share

Wtf does that mean
Lol past week I’m up 5k with TSLA calls and the one day I lose 1k I’m mad at it. Thanks for bringing me back to reality.
No worries mate, it's a play I'm making. The've been too quite through all this.

wtf is actually going on... I don't even know what to buy wtf. Stocks randomly go up 40% on no news, others just stay flat. Index is flat af. Anyone want to create a fake EV start up so we can be millionaires already fuck

Chinese EVs will soar especially NIO. The ccp controls NIO and they won’t let it fail. Huge tariffs will be placed on non Chinese EVs plus Chinese are very nationalistic. Think about this and do your homework NIO cannot fail

Thoughts on Costco before special dividend deadline?
What sets them apart I believe is nio and xpeng going right into the Chinese market backed by the Chinese government. Nio and xpeng also reported decent earnings
Is TSLA on sale right now?
Start waking up an hour before you can start trading options, take a shower, and stop trading weeklies. It’s free real estate
With major bills and states pushing the legalization of THC would companies like GTII and CWBHF be good investments while the stocks are low? I would assume even if the bill passes the house in December it would start pushing these companies up.
LI 40c 0 day expiration LETS FUCKING GO

Damn online shopping trends sped up by 10 years cause of covid, come on SHOP!
u realize that's bullish for baba right
Implications for Retail Therapy through online buying are pretty good. Cyberpunk 2077 will be a market changing event however. Calls on CRSR, AMD, NVDA.
Lmfao I’m almost positive on my PLTR calls...
China is extremely protective, no way they let Ford steamroller domestic markets. Import tariffs are already bonkers
I’m more of a Ram Ranch fan
Hey retards: PLTR has a float of over a billion shares!
Arent they being investigated?
Xpeng killed Tesla
holy fuck
Good enough for me
Screw TSLA and screw AMD
YAAAAASSSSSS
Yes, but j & j is a good gamble because I can guarantee that they are not going to simply let everyone else make money
The smartest thing i ever did was get into options
im glad everyone here has a sex life

19.50 then 20 AH
pretty sure KXIN is the play for next week
Tbh I felt like it’s a little overvalued rn anyways given the company has been around for 17 years and doubled in value in the last week alone. This is definitely a retirement stock, but I’m here for nothing but green dildos.
Market has no idea what to do

Come on Mr. Market, prove me right, show me how smart I am!
I can't speak to that, but I'm looking at the trend in margins and that stat will make or break the company as far as I'm concerned. It looks promising though as of this last year but that's not saying much!
Timing VXX can be really hard, if you want the hedge with this bad boy. A debit spread can help you fight that with some defined risk/gain
Real talk.

Ev hype bubble is real. Aside from tesla, how will the nio, expeng and others generate strong revenues with Ford, gm, Mazda, hyuandai etc all coming out with electric models? 

Won't their ability to do economies of scale and drive mass production dismantle the others?
They dropped the ring in a volcano
PLTR 12/18 16C gonna print
Wym. No point in having more then 16 gb u cant even utilize more then that lmfao
You autists are really keeping PLTR alive.
Nah
I listened to their earnings call last night and they had amazing guidance going into the holiday season. Its also undervalued relative to its main competitor. They have over a 1B in revenue, positive cash flow, theyre tweaking supply to keep up with the  surge demand in gaming hardware for new streamers/internet atheletes for competitive gaming as well. On a final note, with winter time approaching, stay at home behavior isn't changing which will continue to buy their products and in general bring their price up.
Is this a strong company

I know the market doesn't seem to care about cases anymore, but we're already at 75k cases and 800 deaths today, and none of the big states have reported yet. Looks like we blow past 200k/2k today easily.

At some point the market has to react to this, no?  The implications on retail for Black Friday and the Holiday Season have to be pretty bad.
Its terrible, I've lost $3 already!!
today? LMAO
Let me guess, ITM on a low volume stock
Pltr back like an invasion from V
lol. don't worry u will be back
Sure. But I doubt I will sell today. The price action today looks like MMs trying to kill 11/20 weeklies but still accumulating TSLA for a pump next week hopefully.
major bear signs on spy but Idgaf

Some massive SPY sell volume

Would be great to get more of an activist investor role from Cohen. Of course a lot of people are hoping Cohen takes over and starts running GME himself. But even without the Cohen catalyst I see the increase in the gaming pie, transitioning into more e-commerce and the console cycle as good enough catalysts. In shares and leaps and have doubled down at every dip :)!
It's about sending a message.
Decent

NIO PUTS!
11/27 $495C praying Elon doesn't let me down
Ahh gotcha
Dude why didn't you sell in the morning
Was able to turn my 12/4 NIO 54c’s into 12/4 52c’s and only lost like $10 of delta 💪😎
Dear Diary,

I am flabbergasted that GameStop is not above $13 at the time of this entry today.

I sold a covered call when it was $11.50, and saw it moonshot yesterday up to $12.60. Fearing a short squeeze was imminent, I bought back my covered call for breakeven. No money lost, no money gained.

Today I’ve observed the short squeeze continue bright and early this morning. Upon seeing the price hit levels unseen for weeks, it appears that the MMs, like me, who had also sold covered calls at $13, have artificially beaten the stock down in order to close under $13. 

Perhaps the MMs have an ulterior motive with this suppression. I shall eagerly wait and find out next week.

Until then: GME $15.5 11/27 (has crazy volume)

IPO one month ago. 95% customer retention rate. 7 year contract average. 30% comound growth per customer year-over-year. new customers acquired every year. 300 million in private aerospace contract renewal - product is marketable and liked enough by companies using it. Dozens of relevant industries for product. SAAS platform. Where is the logic that this stock will move downwards?  
EDIT: from an RM perspective I really enjoy the optics that the senior leaders display. They're very down to earth. I've worked in disruptive software sales (augmented reality), shit is hard to sell. PLTR is a good long-term pick.

Munchin pulled emergency lending support. We have to pray the children we allowed to run the country don’t try to crash the market out of spite because they lost. They’re a straight up disaster.

Yes
CRSR is not mentioned...
This is hilarious 😂! Glad he lived and no one else got seriously hurt.
It is my professional opinion that your account is small
Boomer
Square and Paypal accept it, why not.
Yo what u guys think about VXX right now?
Just to further comment on this - virtually all of GME's revenue from gaming sales \_could\_ be captured by studios & console makers, if they simply locked this down with digital only.  

It's in their best interest to do this, I think it's only a matter of time.
Baba acts like a trader's stock, even though it's a buy and hold play. I've been tempted way too many times to sell early. Hold!
Apparently you can go through his post history since feb and follow all his trades. Shares only. Yeah it could be a paper account but the numbers add up real money or no.
Lol. We literally just had a massive sell off on XPEV last Friday when we went down -25%. This week, we barely made up that sell off and only slightly up from last Friday. 

Same with NIO. NIO hasn’t made up from last Friday’s sell off and is still in the red from last Friday.
r/politics
Dumped all my FSR calls....thought it was reasonably valued @ 1B especially vs these other stupid EV valuations. 
Not to mention Henrik Fisker designed some badass whips inc. ASTON MARTIN DB9. 
Fisker deserves to win...feel bad bailing

Would love $32, but i’ll start buying at 35

All the bad news is out. Will probably get bought up Monday. I’d sell.
Is anyone holding TSLA over the weekend?
Flux is plug power with no options
market cap is 40 Billion. Doesn't make sense for it be 60+ billion,

The DD in that last one was that it’s gonna be a volatile stock considering it’s PE, just don’t paper hand shares because you buy in too high. Don’t leverage everything off the bat.
Why
Prob gonna let it drop more before going in
Yeah same idiots that suggested to sell at 200, 300...etc.  Hold the line!
just like the original AA, two dudes with one goal. Except they were swapping stories back and forth. I would know
Just going to put it out there:It's pretty fucking rude to exercise the calls you bought

EV overhyped on so many stocks kinda like when weed stocks were
And Citron clapped them
So TSLA going to squeeze the price action to a few pennies around 492? Cool, cool
Google
400 or bust honey
is $271 the resistance?
Cuz that’s how this shit works. It makes no sense.
baba action into next week?
Don’t buy puts against the powell cult. There’s an infinite print button and it doesn’t give af about the economy. *Thanks for joining my Ted talk*
Got 30 boomer stonks at 257 as well. Should’ve just yolo all those into options
PLTR pushin
I think I agree, except I own ETSY long term so I don't like shorting what I own. Otherwise I feel guilty for not believing at 3am.
Where’s the $100 option leap plays?
100 pt
Please boom to EOD market, so I can take some profit and be a weekend bear
Why u bought some fck thing call “stocks “ ??? 

Buy options man. YOLO
How is he going to act like he had no godly idea about their business practices for 8 whole years and then it IPOs and booms and he pulls this shit and sells acting like he hasn’t profited majorly from their business practices. You got to be a true retard to buy that shit.
No!
Same here, but I got $5 1/15/21. I'm up 120%. It's a slow moving stock so it needs time. Also the contract volume is very small so weeklies will not be good
This is true for Tesla too

10am pt or 1pm et - markets generally sell-off due to lunch. News outlets seem to embrace this trend and load up any bad news for those hours. This doesn't really matter if you're a long-term trader though.

> Shares of Tesla TSLA, -1.47% have now risen nearly sixfold in 2020. Jeff Reeves thinks this might be an excellent time to sell the stock and lock in gains. He lays out the arguments for and against the stock, while pointing to a possible problem with demand for the cars in China.

Ok but he lays out a stronger bull case [in his article. ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/now-that-tesla-is-joining-the-s-p-500-should-you-buy-or-sell-11605631506?mod=jeff-reeves) Why does this shitty site undercut its own writers? 

Bull case for Tesla: Jeff Reeves is bald and marketwatch is a toilet.

If pltr gaps down this weekend it will take out half the sub
Should top out in March again. No idea when it takes off.
So about $3,000? That's pretty solid.
i would have but my puts are fucking me in my ass

Yes stupid
1. I hate vote bot and it hates me.
2. Yeah so in Canada we can't use RH hands are tied I have access to TOS as a papertrade account and it stayed live through whole outage but TD broker platform went down just before noon and has been up and down since. Frustrating as hell. Been on hold with CS for two hours trying to get them to give me access to the TOS platform for live trading cuz it ACTUALLY WORKS... since I can't trade, i CAN shop for a new bank to move all my assets to... see if that helps.
BABA stopped at 270 because the OI on 11/20 270c is 20k. Going to get pinned under most likely.

If you want into BABA, now would be a good time while the IV gets burned off a bit. Maybe even wait until EOD when IV has had the most time to settle in.
Ill cum
who blew up their account from buying 11/20 calls on TSLA a few days ago?

Getting 10 shares of VXX to hedge my 40k in call spreads 😎 thanks finance degree

Ha, I know. It was long gone before, as I bought them awhile back and couldn’t sell yesterday after that investor call. They were cheap.
First one is always free.
Yeah instant $1k yesterday and put in $500 today but looks like I'm gonna have to wait till next friday
Well I wish you all the best. I'm holding wmt stonks too

Fuck your pun
Never felt more comfortable losing 3%, Palantir will easily be 50 next year, sell me those cheap stocks you weak handed chickens
CRSRis undervalued or does it have increasingly better growth prospects... dont get it, help me guys im big retarded

I’m planning to just repeats process. Use 5k and turn it into 50k each week lol

The crash was pricing in a far worse case scenario than actually played out, large tech businesses that actually *benefit* in a COVID environment make up a disproportionate amount of the market currently, new Tech in the form of renewables + the possibility of new legislation that boosts these sectors is causing a speculative rush on certain stocks.

And if my memory is correct, Tesla achieved that from subsidiaries. Which means it’s even more difficult for Nio right? Because their car simply cost more than Tesla to build and they make a lot less of them in quantities. Nio also uses all aluminum chassis which is good but cost hell of more than Tesla’s steel+aluminum.
at least I can read the thing in my app that says you can only instant deposit 1k

why tho, why is it undervalued
Seems like MM are trying to keep it under 90 for expiry.
I scroll through here (terrible idea, I know) see what you guys are talking about and if I know anything about the company and think it’ll go up I’ll buy

Holy shit

PLTR leaps, with some spy puts sprinkled in for some flavor, BLNK is way overvalued, EV bubble got solo above $10, and AYRO close to $10...EV bubble real
whats broken today? there is nothing left to break
More options than shares, I guess stocks is your new bank.
Because the entire country didn’t crater and the post-vaccine economy is going to lead to a 6% GDP growth in 2021.
Because everyone else has announced a vaccine on Monday for the past 2 weeks. Shit literally can't go tits up.
Unless your calls expire today
Ayro makes light duty commercial EVs - what is redneck about that?
Don't hurt me please
At this point I’d wait until Monday, but I’m terrible at this so inverse me
$500 lol

*sorts by top gains*
Lol alright who just bought PLTR for 19.01, I see your candle standing proud
I have NIO. Kinda boring imo it stopped the big moves so I moved to LEAPS for that. I’m asking for some degen weeklies fd’s lmao
I remember 2 years ago when if you mentioned anything positive about Tesla you would get mocked on this sub. Now this sub is an Elon musk fan page sometimes

I need to get accepted to grad school ASAP so I an get a loan and buy BABA leaps. Future me will thank me for paying off grad school and securing tendies.
How getting some TSLA calls at Eod
How do you guys not be wusses? I found a stretch of 5 good plays. For each, I was gonna confirm my option order but I wussied out at the last second.
Johnson and johnson?
yeah average of 20 new cases per day so that means 20,000 new cases per day which is pretty bad
how the fuck is shitcoin close to ATH
Yes
Serious question. How long do you generally hold before selling a contract that far out?
Anyone else convinced your positions do better when you're not looking or just me?

Boring morning for me anybody got some pumping trades?

Kinda right homie
Remember fellas, that pullback is good for Tesla. Nothing to worry about. Just opportunity to pile up on those sweet easy tendie calls...👌🏻

He gives a lot of for democracy projects in south east europe. And thats good. He paid for a lot of people university like viktor Orban. He is a fan of open societies.

Read about what Pltr is doing, big data for analysis die police ans security services.
I never called someone moron.
They're not
You know, this is probably a horrible financial decision, but for some reason I have faith that all the morons in here are right and I made the right call buying the PLTR dip

So last week?
NIO
Roblox is a kids game and kids don't have money to invest in stocks, short this stock.
They’re great. And good prices
Any recommendations on what I should hold over the weekend for some YOLO?
*Pump. There I fixed it for you
Anyone use R language? I feel like I’m cheating. Trading on easy mode.
This man speaks the truth
I’d get them ready for the coming week. Get some reasonable ones like mid 40s that expire in a week
2k play?
I’m up a WHOLE 5 doll hairs today :) 💎
SOLO clapped by CITRON LMAO
you still holding brother? Well done.
...still dipping? the dip was 18, we are at 18.45 - tard.
it shifts from government-only clients to commercial( for example their system helped save up to $1 bln for oil company). This is my main bull reason
It literally never fails. As soon as I buy spy options it slowly creeps up and never looks back

Basically the reverse of IV crush.

volatility in the stock is soaring right now and subsequently all option premiums are rising.
Much intelligence
Dude, fucking hell, it's proportionality that matters. Fucking basic shit. If that shit box car is 15% profit vs teslas better car at 7% you lose. I know you know that. Shits going to get super competitive. Vw still dominants china is launching like 100000000 electric cars in the next 3 years. My point is simply enjoy the tendies because telsa fucking prints right now. Just don't believe that they will forever.
Those are rookie numbers - gotta pump those numbers up!!
Is this a beta. I didn't get this email.

Feels bad. 😞😞
Did you not read the Sub rules?
A true fucking autist
Mark my words next week SPI going to take off bois !
I blew up again trying to mess with Tesla this week first time since battery day and sept 1st. 
Never again messing with stocks that premium could wipe my whole account with a 5% drop . I’m having fun with small caps and lower IV . Might even start selling someday if I can save enough $..
SPY must buy it soon. Many other mega funds must buy it soon.
What do people mea. By dark pools
JMIA about to be up BIGLY


If you missed on BLNK  XPEV etc. rally it not too late to jump in JMIA
Nothing, no news is good news for a stock that is massively undervalued and just went down 20% for almost no reason at all.

I am really bad at option do you want to share your few calls on jan and april?
Yes.
10 bags? How can I say no
Good points! Ill say I am also heavily invested in green funds just looking for a 6 month or so speculative play
Retards here will just say Masa lost billions yoloing this year, so what he says is irrelevant lol
U think the Chinese government will release that kind of data? Shit....they are gonna hide that for them trade deals.
don’t want to get greedy but Netflix looks like it could push to $509 EOD here
NIO has room to grow before a dip comes
Maybe in reality, but here is funtown, no.

If you got some serious cash to put in, just slowly buy in averaging up and down.

Ok, Master Retard, you have 6k right now. What do you do?
Baba bull flagging. This can push to 275-280 next week
I often wish I had the patience for Theta gang.
I really sold my 1/21 NFLX 500c this morning for a fucking loss....
Im not a big fan either but i think its obvious these mega companies who are down will recover at some point even if they ultimately are gone in 30 yrs
Sure bro
But really. Dont invest solo.. that shits funny and all, but the company is garbage
Hope y’all load up on JMIA 09/17/21 30c 🚀

This question turned out to be a easy way to pull the trigger on PLTR puts considering everyone seems to be in way over their head, trying to pump this lmao

It must feel even worse being one of the few people who lost on Tesla this week not the only one. back in September I lost about 37k in Tesla chasing the top. so you could have fucked up even more
Hahaha, and then you wont be able to sleep all weekend just thinking about how fucked you will be on monday
this is dd. he sees ugly and it prints...
thank you pltr for the dip.
Xpeng is gunna have a sell off because they are at their ceiling. NIO won’t have a big sell off till 60
These are the vehicles of the new world order future. Living in tiny pods, driving your tiny EV car, eating synthesized meat from a tube. Soon you won't be able to drive them yourself, just pick from a pre-selected list of allowed locations.
It’s “groundbreaking tech” in a lot of fields imo but not really for autonomous driving.
Congrats and, as always, fuck you
I would get rid of if I don’t like it, sell the bike and stop paying the monthly. The place I was going was more of an “athletic club” which is an overpriced gym, so the break even is a bit quicker than if it were planet fitness.
PLTR 19c
ER on the 30th. Careful!
It’s just how the stock behaves. Once you understand this, easy money.
when you buy?!?! this strike is juicy
Lol this aged badly
It was down 20% start of the week.
BABA is free money
SOLO
Proud of you king 👑
Lol atleast I’m not that dumb, I mean if it was set to expire around a year from now you had nothing to lose by holding on. PLTR has genuinely great future outlook. It’s probs going to be worth keeping track off for the next few years
Honestly.. none of this makes sense. Companies doubling their market share in a month.. you tards have completely fcked the market.
roblox bad roblox go boom
TSLA consolidating for next week 🚀
No dips. Buy now

Skype got turned into Microsoft Teams awhile ago
I’m retarded and have no idea what I’m doing I bought a decent amount yesterday evening assuming it would go up the next day and it did. Then I started feeling myself I was like damn I’m not bad at this, it hit 19 but then started dipping I panicked and sold and then bought again when it started going up a lil and now it absolutely plummeted 

In conclusion i am retarded and it’s a good thing I’m too poor to put in any sizeable amount of money into anything
Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind
Feels like the ship has already sailed
I mean just look at what SOLO is outputting, nobody is ever going to buy that POS, easiest short of my life
Just file for bankruptcy rn

Thoughts on WDAY? And if u have calls what’d u buy
Favorite EV stock other than Tesla?
NIO will blow up when they get the hype next week. Xpeng won this week but NIO wins long term because they do triple the sales of xpeng and Lidar isn’t really good honestly. I actually understand what it is but the hype beasts just think it’s some groundbreaking tech lmao
HOME gonna keep going up 🔝
Fully. I wouldn’t buy puts yet, but it will be like the weed stocks dump.
Last chance to get 350 0dte 10 baggers

I would say BABA will mostly be green most of the whole next week, so i’d probably say hop in before closing today
Well duh lol. A more specific place. Like a website, etc.
Buying puts on low cap meme penny stocks is just not a good time. 

And I don’t mean like, NIO, or even XPEV, but like SOLO, FSR, AYRO, etc.
Meade pump
First step is understanding you’re slow. Now that you know this, you will fit in well. Good luck in the casino sir.
What exp date for the Tesla leap?
All good bro these things happen
You’ll get the next one, esp in this 🦘 market
👏🏻 👏🏻
I made a 4% loss 😀
what news is there for BABA to go up 4% today?
Just put half my account in $VIAC because it looks sexy
gf had a great tip and she knows jack shit about investing

They went up from around $2 to $3 in a day early this month and were featured in the day's biggest movers on Robinhood. I took a look, saw they were an EV company, and bought a couple of $4-5 calls expirations between today and next june. 

Wish I'd gone in for more, but hey, 1500% returns on a couple hundred dollars is still nice.
I dont think the majority of people here are holding for 2 years though
My BABA shares are so underwhelming :( but gains I guess
Since the market has been going up, I would assume any stocks that were going down this whole time probably won't do too well if the market actually tanks.
vxx too low imo
Why is this not tagged as DD?
I bought for $5.40 back in June
Because it took a dump popped back up
Baba as much as I fucking hate Chinese companies and refuse to buy them myself kinda fits this bill
I don't see how it could go below $10. sure 20% rise on the day, but low risk entry point at $11.90. well $12.05 now.
I got some for hedge
Kid already got a bit of a beer gut. He's doing well.
Bois buy baba for the love of god it’s basiclly free money at this point
My problem is even if they can catch up in sales numbers, how can they be as profitable as Tesla. Their current business model just don’t make sense. Ultra luxury showrooms, crazy good&costly customer services, everything oem from supplier and JAC.
Where and how
Hoping for a real pump here EOD
which FD for me? serious answers only, rent is due
PLTR is that meaty bit at the end of a rack of ribs thats so delicious you cant decide if you should start with it or save it for the grand finale
The only people dumber than anyone long NKLA is anyone short NKLA just to get wrecked repeatedly. 

That's me 🤡🤡🤡

Bro xpeng is at its ceiling for the week the profiteers are gunna sell off by end of day or Monday. They are just seeing how high it can go but max is 57 so they will start selling off since it’s basically there
I would keep waiting, more selling is coming. Retards will buy it again next week though so it probably goes up again even if it has no business doing so.
Buy puts accordingly
Good option pick?

Oh shoot. It's Canadian! Get him!
Yes.
I got like 600 invested right now and almost half is in a 12/18 50c for CRSR. After that sells way sooner than it should I’ll half close to 600 to spend on stuff
LIIIIII
Lol, I sold my SQ calls for a small loss and put it in spy puts. Ever since SQ and SPY  has mooned leaving me in shambles again. Only hope is BABA shoots to 325 by next friday
Yea $28. Just used to the standard notation. Sold before that Citron shorting tweet that knocked it out. Phew
I’ve been watching baba lately but missed the gains today cause I was too busy watching these EV companies print. Should I buy in now or baba or wait for a dip? I’ve seen this stock jump a lot and quickly so I’m scared to hold off on buying now.

Yes and this is why NIO has 2 months of order backlog
Damn up 12% net portfolio this week? Is it even possible to lose in this market
Picking up 9k in TSLA and PLTR leaps at EOD
still China will try and eventually steal the tech and give it to its automakers like nio or whoever the government supports.
I have the TD mobile Authenticator for two factor authentication and it’s not authenticating for either app.
not concerned at all tbh
Jesus I just looked at the chart. I had an order in on IPO day & cancelled since it faded so fast. Fuck me.

To make up for my shitty earnings play?
Why is twtr up and price predictions for next week???
Too many people would profit, feel like we're all gonna get cucked but holding steady
there's no options market for this shit company lol
CRSR 12/18 55C
Is that new? I switched to TOS for many reason, this being a huge one.
Honestly this movement is good. PLTR is simultaneously burning premium and killing all the 11/20 20c that was around, and testing the 18 floor. It bounced exactly at 18 on the dot, which is hilarious.

Anybody playing 11/20 who didn't sell on the peak this morning fucked up. We will keep flying next week.

I’m down. Just get me the fuck out of here.
Ok well it's easy, fuck all. Hence why they only make money from selling credits that are going to go away sooooooon. And don't get me wrong, love the tesla play, just don't drink the koolaid and actually think they are esome super company
FR huge sell off today, crazy. It’ll go back up though
Honestly the PLTR dip was a gift to the share holders. They said 
“ hey, you made it here and thank you for that. Now were going to drop one more time so you can make even more gains. “

Thanks PLTR.
Market is always bullish, except when it isn’t.
Great business model with solid financials. Plenty room to grow. But don’t take my word on this, do some research for yourself.
just went all in ntflx

Holy fuck - I just started trading with level II quoting (I'm not sure why I completely ignored this, but this has actually changed up the game.

3/19 16c baby
It’s an insta ban. People already tried it
has great potential long term for sure. but it went up %80 in 10 days soo
Now the question is when do we bail on it?
I’m selling puts on FCEL and it’s awesome collecting 1.71 for a dec18 6p. the stock is around fucking 5 and a half dollars
This is a blue chip chip stock
What’s the WSB EOD FD for the week? All in for tendies!!
Stop posting my purchases
Guys max pain for BABA is 270

If you had calls in the AM congrats, getting into It now is just theta rape

Edit: unless you are going 300 11/27 FD’s
What the fuck is a Fintech?
Welp, sold SNAP call too soon! Still have a little (riding profits), geez this ones got legs
[deleted]
What ticker you talking about? Spill the beans!
It's a slow mover. If it holds 10.60 today should be good.
PLTR puts
This
Spy bull flag
I’ve been railed by PLTR all week by buying into the hype here thinking it would go higher for my calls and it did not work. I’m -75 on it and I’m a small value account so take that as you will
Bought baba December 18th 295 calls, and January baba 320 calls, going to be like 200-300 percent return easily
Best chips in the game
Yep
Can you say 40 year old virgin
No matter when, how, where, or why  I buy AAPL, it manages to screw me over.
I bought when it was 19.28 and then panic sold at like 18.50 like a true tard
Well this should at least should up the value retards for awhile with their talk about rotations.
COTY gapping up after the dip get in
[deleted]
Yeah JAC makes their cars, and they still have a better vehicle margin than xpeng. Have a greater demand although they only sell 50% of the Chinese market (SUV's) while xpeng offers both sedans and SUV's, so really NIO has more room for growth as they haven't even accessed half the new EV market.
Are you explaining to me how you are going to lose money?
Paper handed my ZM 12/4 calls. Would hope it tanks next week so I feel justified but I'm not a 🌈🐻, so fu*k that
#11/27 TWTR CALLS OFF THE CHARTS THIS TRAIN HAS LEFT THE STATION AND NOT COMING BACK 50 HERE WE GO!!!!
7k to a mil with that call volume? Wtf lol
Apple 3 month chart flat lmao
AZN calls are about to free tendies after announce their results.

Can someone direct me to babystreetsbets?
You're making my pp hard

Wtf why is there barely any options for AYRO?
Ya’ll investing in terminator skynet PLTR when you could have CROX like a real badass🦆
and tesla
Grwg is a good move?  Been looking at it
Besides clout, bitches on tap, and a new bullet point on your resume.... I’ll throw in all the awards my gain porn can afford
Probably sure. But its high right now eh?
Yes they allowing soft core Cinemax movies
550 TSLA 11/27
Well stop. I need my Poots  to print thanks
SPG up again today. My leaps are up 29% in total.
Well, someone bought it. If it fulfills at expiration I still make 25% on my position. If it doesn’t that’s fine with me too. Just keep selling em til it does :P
Hope you’re right!
I will singlehandedly pop this EV bubble. Watch this.  I'm buying XPEV NIO and RIDE
COTY
Tell me some plays with my $300 left to get my account back on track
Hold, if ev dips I'll buy some calls
F
What does that have to do with SE tho?
XPEV's P7 Wing LE sedan looks dope AF.
Yes
Yes- I agree. I like their voodoo chips too. Don’t try them or you’ll be an addict
Twitter about to be in the gap. $50 calls are cheap for next week
They are a great company if they have the technology to locate and capture Bin Ladin
Me because i am up 32 bucks on my TLT calls
Grindr 

No condom
Only due to selling green credits. They don't actually make fuck all besides that. Just a little more legit that trevor getting solar panels installed on his house
i hope it keeps moooooning i need it to keep moooooooning
I blew up my account with Tesla calls right before they didn’t get in SP500 and went to low 300s and this week I revived my account on this pump from them finally being included. 

Full circle.

They've been banning the shit out of those and people are losing games they've purchased.  I have an old FB account, but I haven't logged in for several years and don't want to.
Market too flat imo
let me just break out my stack of confidential production costs real quick
Got a couple Yeets for over the weekend.  Spy 380 Christmas Eve.  Gonna flip if we have a big green dildo Monday
Whoever bought my 0DTE 20c PLTR calls this morning, thank you for lunch
nope
Then do cheap weeklies until u can. This week I bought a tesla 490c 11/20, the whole contract for $18. I sold the next day for $15 but the day after that the price of the contract went to $1,000. Don’t be a retard like me and it’s possible
If BABA holds above 270 it's going to fucking soar.
268.73
I sold my Xpeng 55 calls for January at 9:32 am Eastern time and bought palantir. One minute later it spiked. I've just been feeling sick to my stomach this whole morning watching how my life could have changed had I kept it. Any advice? I just feel so shit right now

Are you serious? If this is true then I may actually throw down
People still buying JNUG??
Sounds like the only true way to defeat covid is to become a mall Santa
What I’m saying is to sell everything every Friday, and only use 5k when investing each week. So I can secure and not touch other portion of money
Lockdowns starting up and  it’s relatively cheap
if you didn't buy the PLTR dip.. well your full-on tard.
Definitely a bit of a dump, seems to be rebounding now. Waiting to see eod.
Yesterday I posted my official Price Target of $100 within 2-4 Months.

Get in now
I sold and will buy on a pull back
Are you me?
So he turned 40k into over 1M on only shares? Is that what you're saying? Cuz I call extreme bullshit
It won’t meme but it could easily go to fair valuation in the mid 20s
Yeah just ticker change
You know how it goes lol
It didn't even go lower than yesterday's low yet. You bought at the top or what?
That’s why I’m not buying and was wondering if anyone had some that were hidden. I just pulled everything and am waiting for the crash.
No francias, but I’ll take the suck
Saving this comment
What’s pumping the market rn ?
Snap calls = a good time
🤡🤡🤡🤡

Nah I'm having a great day. Been scaling into BABA since the -8% day
Amzn calls over the weekend
[removed]
Thanks, I wish I had advice but I mostly just got lucky with pltr and the tail end of nio
Is PLTR actually a great growth company which is gonna moon or just a meme created by WSB
Yeah done did got outta that.

Doh!
Not all Walmart’s, as far as I know there is still lots of expansion potential within sams and Walmart.
Id poop my pants
thanksgiving week is traditionally a light volume week, and usu. goes up.  This year with the plandemic, who knows, but good bet that it'll shift upwards. 

&#x200B;

bought BABA calls.
damn CRSR is at $40 lmao wtf
You’ve made me $50s of dollars. God speed.

Bro just suck a cock and the pain goes away
i didnt hear no bell
Sell and buy further out
And I cashed out this morning at 52. If it did under 54 today, I'm back in. If not, I bet there'll be chances next week. Looks to be a good long term. By good I mean fantastic.
Rotation from CIIC, KNDI, SOLO, FSR, FUV, and RIDE (and all their profits) into NIO, XPEV, and LI.

This is quality shit lmao
Not middle aged with kids depending on you or might think differently.
come on PLTR the red color doesnt look good on you 🤭🥰 get back up there
Selling puts is a bullish move , not buying
Only down 6% on my PLTR leaps. Life ain’t baaaad baby.
Oh hell no, Way too far otm.  Typically I try to keep it within 10% of the underlying unless calls are really cheap or really long dated.

Even my flyers typically are within 20% of the underlying but IV needs to be relatively low and I need to be pretty confident in the play.
NIO 50 EOD lets goooooo
soooo who's going to have bragging rights this weekend?
Ok? Palantir doesn't make money yet lol. I don't really care about who the guy is. Been around for how long and lost...how much?
Baba 300 eod
FUCK I shorted bynd$ at 136 just now 
Why ?!!

The fuck man
SPY will end the day up 1%.
Can one of you nerds explain to me how options work on SPACs after the business combination is announced? When the ticker changes does my call change to the new ticker? Shit be whack yo
So I sold TDOC and BABA before their jumps. Anyone want me to buy into something and quickly sell with my teepee hands?
WOW CLNE. thats a ticker i havent heard from in over 8 years. Had some of that POS when it was in the $14s
buy poots
I’m with you brother got 50% of my account in it
Bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
LI JetLi Sway Li

They don’t make money, that’ll work short-term but it’ll crash on itself eventually IMO. I’m not stubborn in changing my mind, if the company eventually catches my eye. I would never short it lol.
No rotation, sadness for increased Thanksgiving  restrictions

You mean pump it? Shit is pinned to expire calls worthless imho
“Listen, orange is kind of retarded”
COTY with the price upgrade after citigroup or bazingo tried to fuck them with fake news. Move that price point to 15 and ill call it good, k?
Tsla
So there’s a chance
No, Tesla is the only and first foreign auto maker in China own by themselves 100%, no forced “partnership”. That’s why I believe the competition from Tesla is so fierce. In China, Tesla make their cars by themselves with their own IPs in huge quantities. Not only they are far more profitable, they can use more aggressive pricing strategies as well. On top of that, Elon and Tesla is already a household name with a status similar to Apple in China.
more like 70 cents after tax.
ntflx babe
Would probably have to wait for the market to not be near ATHs to find those deals.
this is interesting, i'm going to try this out, thank you
BABA eod predictions?
call me Mommy
Lets ride this to tendie land and beyond.
It will because we are retarded. Bankruptcyception
[deleted]
Thanks for making me feel better about myself 😘
Why?
Even my AAPL leaps are hurting now
My body is ready.
It will move ( or may tank) once the regulations on fintech are finalized.
EV is overvalued AF but dunno what other wave to ride. Which EOD FD's guys?

PLUG, SBE, FCEL, or XPEV
cars aren't investment grade; they are heavily depreciating assets 

The first sentence isn't really up for debate. It isn't about yields it is about market value. i.e. increasing housing prices, long term bonds like the 30 year (TLT etf) going up in value as money piles into them and yields fall, stocks going up 10%+ per year constantly establishing higher multiples
NFLX NOW
So, what's your next move?
PLTR
LI leaps?
Closed some positions in morning at top. Rolled over into daily ZM and tripled money. Now I’m back in on PLTR
Lol it doesnt work like that. You will owe tax even if you buy stocks with gains. Since you already realized the gain, your tax should be 35%+
tesla dump in 3...2...1 🐻
Same, usually just pats me on the head and says thanks for the sammich
Tesla has an entire order of magnitude of cars over NIO. For every one NIO there's at least 10 Tesla's which will appear in the single percentages of one to the other. I agree, it probably looks like they're getting slaughtered now, but if revenue, production and margin continue their trend or even slightly less, they are on track to rival tesla in a couple years. I'm not sure what the CCP is doing to help them.

NIO is producing 10k cars a quarter vs 100k TSLA. 1:10 in production alone. If that starts to close things will look different.
reasonable crsr price target? WHEN TF CAN I ENTER THIS IS INSANE
Stock can still rise before official merge. See $IPOB. Ideally it merges however, as stated previously, inflows have overlooked this stock so far, has been asleep at $10 after quick bounce to $13, I see another big jump soon target is $20
life was simpler when all yolos were just earnings plays where 90% lost money
**EV & Corsair Bears Mass Extinction Event**

**11/20/20**

If NIO could hit 50 again that’d be greeeaaaaat
Sold some today. Gonna buy dip next week rinse and repeat. We going to the 🌝
none if the social security is not ur name
Nice nio short
PLTR is back from the dead and on the rise again
FLUX the next BLNK watch
Already did my fellow autist!
Trying to, I rolled my 11/20 $5 covered calls into 12/18 12.50 calls, but I'm losing my ass. I suck at this game...
Dow Jones been teasing that 30k for way too long now, this shit giving me blue balls

NFLX doing this just to fuck with me. Need it back below 490
Selling calls on that ass more market cap than ford.  If you going long try a spread in case IV drops?
So instructive looking at disconnect between market vs media gloom and doom

Alright boys. What's the play next week? EV again? Whats the rotation?
Thinking of going all in on TSLA 520c 11/27 eod. Thoughts?
GOTCHA BRO!
No
Btw my dude any thoughts on PLTR? I try to stay away from stocks that seem too bullish on WSB but for CRSR I just really love their products so that’s why I’m ok with getting in on the action
What ya'll wanna bet 15 minutes after market close, the MM's dump this shit into the ground?
Have a feeling NIO gonna break 50, LI gonna break 40, and XPEV sustains 55 EOD
Fucker should be permabanned
I keep getting spam calls saying they are going to cancel my social security number if I don’t call back.

**by all means please do, then I won’t have to pay taxes**
Hold, the price should be 290 at least by now and I have full confidence it will hit that next week
Yessir
Li is ridiculous, glad I jumped in today!
This is a bad deal, and it's not free money. The Intel news caused this pile to finally move, but their valuation is asinine. Blah blah blah, the rules don't apply to tech valuation you say? Well look at their competitor VLDR who, ya know, sells actual products and makes actual revenue. A month from now they will be back hanging out around $10 at trust value.
Finally NFLX
Wow ICLN finally finna close above 22
Pltr
What if you can’t afford long calls...asking for a friend
I sold my calls for a measly $90 profit and the next day they're $540 each.
I know how shorting works and how a short squeeze can happen. But none of what you said above is actual math, unless your math is just "VW went 5x, 130% > 30%, so this can go 10x". The VW case was also different in the fact that Porsche announced they were effectively about to own 74% of the common stock (and another 20% was tied up by another big investor), meaning that only 6% of the stock was actually free floating and with a 12% short to outstanding share ratio, the stock had essentially 200% of its free float shorted.
IWM and QQQ outperforming SPY today. SPY calls for next week is probably the way.

Added a few more here. $210c 11/27. It will hit all time highs at $201.33 today. Above it, straight shot to $210

pltr.
Yeah they’re awesome honestly
Are SPY 360 12/31 calls a bad idea
Fuck is Ayro the next NIO or XPENG?
It's coasting to $500 soon, pandemic
No. But XPEV did 30% this week. LI is lagging the most out of all EV plays this week.

I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing why is palantir plummeting it was going so well
so, I guess using a Oculus for some scrumptious porn is as good as shipping your porn habit logs to FB and eventually posting it publicly (the eventual hack that will take place and find all of the data that FB is supposedly NOT collecting. we've all seen that movie before).
Well, looks like my 2 Covered ABBV 101 Calls are going to get called away. Maybe rotate into MSFT or something with the cash and repeat the process.
Tesla makes money?
Time go get some PLTR, glorious dip
This feels like the kinda day where stimulus goin well news will come out at 3:15 and we’ll pump into close
The point is that just because his thesis here seems correct, does not mean it will work. Everybody on the planet basically thought SPY would correct down to 150 from covid and the terrible economic conditions, yet it did exactly the opposite. Even variationseparate's thesis for the oncoming bull trap followed by another down turn made a LOT of sense. yet it didnt fucking work.

So maybe Monday?
Only thing I can think of is Loop initiating this morning with a buy rating and $35 PT but it just completed a 3 day head and shoulders this morning so I'm expecting a dump back to $21-$22 by eom Monday.

Just bought my shares during this dip. I don’t dabble in calls really.
I think hold. If you're afraid of theta, then open a spread.

Never mind the fact they’d have to sell 20x more than Tesla to make the profit differential equal 😂

I grabbed 8 15c 2/19/21, tried to post as proof so there would be SOMEONE that had positions, automod removed it cuz im a broke bitch. I did buy tho. How tf do I show my proof to you autist
Whats up with TWTR
Great DD. I wish all WSB DD posts were this strong. I'm tired of where this sub is going. 

Just keep in mind that there is always a risk that the bid gets increased to a price where shareholders would be happy. Happens all the time in M&A situations
Amazing

Fuck haha seen 3 people do this recently now me now you yeah aww
Wtf is going on with those candles on APPS?
Someone is for sure putting that together.
Since the market closes at 1pm EST on next Friday for Thanksgiving, does that cause theta to burn faster? I'm guessing so, since those options will indeed be worthless after market close if they aren't ITM, so time value will burn faster.
FUBO meme time? Not much talk here but I feel like it’ll fly

Positions or ban
All of it
It literally did 15% this week. I mean it’s good, but low relative to other EV stocks
Aye bro profits is profits. Remember you could have put it in something else and made nothing or worse take a loss.
Please baba
i love how the trend for SPY today is rangebound with the lows getting higher, and the highs getting lower. Which means it could just break out in either direction and it's a literal coin toss.
Back to business on Monday

Could make $750 selling next months $21 calls, would cap your gains but a win is a win.
Yo if Li breaks $40 my 2K is worth shit
You’re retarded
the EV boom is supported by TSLA on a 4/30 day bull run.
And with a price target of 300... sky is the limit with square.
Beat earnings by a billion too!
$GDNP good long term environmental friendly play
Once vaccine gets deployed and virus numbers come down, this will be how the market moves everyday. 

Up or down 0.3%.
Lockdowns bullish for tech. Cmon give us more.
That would suck, I’ve got 1 12/18 $35, riding these gains to December.
Saw target price is 300. LETS FUCKING GET IT
Do you sell covered calls owning all that stock? You’d make a shitload.
Is this the genius who claimed that AI is Alibaba Intelligence?
They bought calls expiring in 2 weeks bro lol
TSLA is always scary you just gotta strap in and hope it doesn't run out of charge
Problem is so many people around us bought Tesla, my sample is small but the ratio is staggering.
Chose PYPL over Square when both were at 181, oh well

Surprised there isn't more people talking about CRSR, this thing doesn't stop!
Nah it's just the media trying to turn our pets against us... My dog has been watching CNN and suddenly hates white males, which is an issue seeing as I'm a white male

I knew I should have gotten the apps calls for 11/27 instead.  God damnit.  RIP 10x 43c.
UVXY at same level it was in late February, fucking ridiculous....  Just picked up 7 Dec 18th $13 UVXY Calls, UVXY is a like a siren song that I keep crashing myself into over and over again....  Still, it feels like the calm before the storm like in late February, everyone had a feeling Covid would wreck shit up, but no one wanted the party to end and make the first move out of the markets.......

I called it out earlier, hopefully you jumped in. All time highs coming at $201.33. Breaking above will have a clear shot at $211
I'm with you, it's addition by subtraction at this point. Survival.
Had this a couple months back and sold for a quick profit; they're actually trying to cash-in on a hydrogen car - - Edison(?) if I remember.  Funny it's going up on solar.

Somebody should make an all EV ETF fund. I’d buy the shit outta that forever. NIO, LI, XPEV, TSLA, PLUG, BLNK, RIDE, SOLO
Damn I was gonna buy SQ call EOD if it didnt hit $200 but now I dont want to

Pretty good, got in at 13, had 16c 11/27 that I sold for +150% and still up 10% on my shares
I'm going to feel bad for the people who bought my $40 11/20 $CRSR calls earlier this month if $CRSR ends the day right under $40.
Bought 100 12/18 @35 c Corsair contracts on Monday for like $2.00 they are sitting at $8 now just took half the profits and letting the rest of this bitch ride
Pltr$ GETTING ASS FUCKED

You can buy and sell multiple identical  contracts in the same day and it only counts as one day trade on RH correct?
Sqqq 21 by next Friday or no?

Prob cuz she was ousted
Cashed out some of my SOLO at the top and put it into Telos. Seems like a boomer stock tho
Went on their website and it really does suck. Also read some pretty bad reviews regarding delivery and fulfillment issues. There is little to no accountability for stolen packages and broken or missing items from third party sellers. Also the overall growth of this company is underwhelming especially given the hype around e-commerce expansion under coronavirus.  It's advantage against true e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba is highly overstated and its fake image as an African company won't retain much brand loyalty when those other players enter the market. All this being said the company is being pumped up by Shitron Research and other institutions and retail investors who don't read financials or look at earnings and growth. So this will likely go way past its highest conceivable valuation based on the reality of its current business and hit some unjustifiable price.
Is your caps lock key stuck?
ZM about to go ape shit watch
Xpeng will have a sell off soon they are hitting their current ceiling so once people stop buying at the top the fat will get trimmed. NIO still has room to grow
Great advice
That’s pretty steady climb compared to SOLO which did like 100% in a single day.
DABO!!!!
who bought rkt ?
Roblox has a giant, looming IP problem on the horizon. Some of the most popular games are ones that use highly protected content (disney, marvel, spongebob, soylent). They directly profit off of IP infringement through Robux purchases within those games.
Haven't looked at my account all day. Going to open it maybe  EOD. It'll be a surprise.
bullish. People buy new iPhones after they rage throw their old iPhone when they miss out on deals

I’ve noticed since I started adding pumpkin to my dog’s food she has become really racist, can that be caused by the high amounts of vitamin A?
How much you willing to bet it will just be another news conference whining about election fraud?
Perfect time to buy up some more KNDI calls before the weekend. #buythedip
As long as the ticker isn’t RKT it has a chance to move $5-$10 in a week.
If anyone wants to roll the dice, there is a pretty good play on the horizon with Penn REIT (PEI).  

It's going through a pre-packaged bankruptcy in which the equity isn't to be impacted and all the debt gets rolled into new debt. All the major debt holders are already on board.

There will be an immediate bump upward once the "bankruptcy" is completed within a month or so, and if you're willing to ride it out through COVID for a year or two into a more normal business environment, it could be a 5-10 bagger on the common and also the dividends will return.
Fucks with the technicals huh?
Tbh just google the difference between options and "Optionsschein" to get a broad overview instead of relying on me. If you have any questions after that regarding derivatives or shitty european brokers, feel free to drop me a message in my inbox.
yuck
PLTR support at 18 looks liek

This is very true. But so easy to do with stonks
That SPI pump and dump in late September was a blast
Cash Secured Puts could also work. Buy calls on a slow day. Although if a MM is holding the price under $13 today may be a cheap/slow day to buy calls. Any other day I bet it would be hitting $14.
I’m bout to give y’all noobs a great tip

Organize your portfolio into sections: tech, boomer stocks, pandemic stocks (zm etc), China stocks

That way you can tell what’s going on in the market at a glance. Bigly green pandemic stocks? Virus fears. Big green boomer stocks? Sector rotation. Tech green? Business as usual, printer is on
All these EVs are going to start issuing shares soon they don’t make money they’d be crazy not to.

Monopoly money... worthless
What I'm seeing on Twitter is the executive order issued awhile back about most favored nation had no way of actually implementing that rule. It was just an "I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!" moment with no real-world plan.

That is so annoying because so much movement happens during power hour. Should be an optional feature
I love you daddy
Idk i made 2 times +40%. I would wait for a dip
Thank you. I opted out of chasing XPEV calls for GMHI instead this morning so I’m content. If there was some game changer that I’m missing I’d have no problem selling my old NIO shares to switch to XPEV long term, but it sounds like that’s not the case.
The merger close date is in q1, but that could go to March 31st, so what happens if it doesn’t close by February 19th

What the absolute FUCK! When did UTZ start trading publicly and why the fuck did I never know...I eat a minimum of one barrel of sourgdoughs a week. I jerk off to UTZ sourdough pretzels daily. Holy shit this was the best news I’ve ever seen I remember looking if they were public few years back and was pissed they weren’t. Best pretzels in the game hands down.
Idk what HIMX even is but it was close to 5$ already an only .05 at the time it’s an easy 4 bagger as it is rn

There’s only a buy button. Can’t find options button. And for that reason, I’m out.
SPI is the new WSB meme stock ! Lets go !
Dip lmao

For 11/20 20c?
Wish ACCD volume was higher, beautiful chart with Cathie Ark's blessing
SOLO is dogshit, first to collapse for sure

I’m sorry that it’s not what you want to hear but I’m just realistic. I play with both these stocks and have made a lot from them but trends don’t lie man
TSLA 11/27 plays?
Yup this made my day 🤣
Everybody buy SPI ! this is our new meme stock for next week ! I’m sure y’all see me post here a lot so you know this is legit !! Lets go boys !!! Let make this bread ! 12.5 calls looking juicy ! 12/18
So fucking close to selling Apple
Lots of pegging on all sides
Haha man I should have bought in on the 2% day yesterday, just didn't wanna risk another drop and waited til today to be safe. Train is leaving the station boys!
When are we gonna pump LI
BLNK will it keep going up?
They do that on purpose
You own this shit?
Check Walter Bloomberg in twitter
Apple is prime for a lift off
just bought hella pltr calls for next week on top of already having leaps ... i just know this is gonna end up horribly lmfao
Vix is actually dead. Back to its lowest levels since the bad news that started happening, fuck this.
Big money bought calls on Xpeng today.  So - idk if listening to you is a good idea.
Absolutely nothing
Thoughts on JNUG??

That shit is $0 now fam
baba is fine. nio is high risk
I bought shares and am a little nervous about losing them with the covered calls I sold.  I wish I didn't but it was my way of averaging down
This will be our finest meme stock. 

Imagine opening the door to get out of your gold plated Hyundai as cocaine and hookers spill out onto the street. Bystanders run up to you to ask how you became so rich. You slowly lower your sunglasses and say **roblox**
Joe Rogan tried the same thing. Didn’t work out so well for him.
Well considering the number of cars they have made is in the tens of thousands, it wouldn't even make a dent in the population out east. I guess I would think in orders of magnitude and make note of how many of the cars even exist. It's really hard to make an estimation based off this.
or... and hear me out... he realizes he fucked up and either wants to drive the price down to get a better re-entry price / has shorts on it. I refuse to believe he'd go on a PR spree shitting on Palantir without something (monetary) to gain. 

Just look at the headlines like this FFS: https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/11/18/george-soros-anxious-to-sell-palantir-stake.html
NIO because they are unveiling new stuff this weekend and analysts will upgrade price targets and they had a underwhelming week, they should have gone up more
Lol you’re not getting the argument here are ya pal
Bought 200 shares of PLTR this dip is juicy
Sell that at open today and buy new contracts
no it sells automatically but if u havent hit the strike and it auto sells i dont think u get any profit even if u did make profit, but if u sell it manually before it auto sells u get the profit
Is PLTR a dip or just the beginning of a bleed
Diamond hands my friend
It actually looks worse lmao, I’m in
I understand the pump in the other small EV companies, but NIO, LI, and XPEV followed each other leading up to each of their ERs and have for the most part after as well, but NIO has kind of gotten left behind lately. Kinda figured all three would be following each other with LI behind because of recalls and XPEV would slow down but nope.
Also holding 7.5 c AYRO
Username checks out
I think for day or two it was below 1k lol
hugging $357 for dear life. hang in there SPY.
Good job

What a fucking ride this one has had this week
How about now fren?
u know who peter theil is brah?
but we don't hate that at all
I'll repeat it again....Xpeng Lidar announcement was nice....but just wait until Nio unleashes the motherload at Nio Day 🍗🍗🍗  

BTW I hold xpev as well.
The china rug pull is going to be nasty
Did you do 3 lines of coke before writing this? CRSR is old news by WSB standards.
XPEV erect 🚀
That salope!
Have you seen the new car? Basically electronic lambo for like $50,000
Puts it is.

I probably make enough money to not work, but I still work. My portfolio is like 12X my post-tax income, so lately my portfolio returns are greater than my wages. But I don't want to be caught holding my dick when the music stops, which it always does, so I'm not willing to give up reliable income.
gg's brother we ride to the lows before the highs
XPEV is just fucking crazy.

EV in general is going apeshit. SOLO, BLNK, XPEV, NIO (taking a rest below 50 for OPEX), LI, AYRO, CIIC.

If you aren't in at LEAST one EV stock right now you have fucked up.
Pls go back down to 10 so I can buy more
> bull flag

No sir, that is my rocket refueling station.
nice year, way to go man
dont worry brother. ive missed out on pltr, solo, nio, xpev etc. pretty much all the ev stocks

but you gotta stick to your rules. i may of missed out on 4 plays but have saved my self countless times as well
Hear me out guys I make money for a living so just trust me yet again and you will make money. Xpeng is going to sell off today or Monday buy it then, buy NIO now it has room to grow before a sell off since it’s price target is 60 and they are unveiling new products this weekend. There ya go, listen or don’t listen it’s on y’all

This dude obviously missed the timings
Just bought 100 more shares of palantir up to 255 at 14.11 cmon babeh
Back to boring:

Let’s fucking go DLTR
yes, buy the dip.
Yeah fuck you MM for fucking my tsla puts, would have been making a bank on them if yall didnt cuck them into oblivion
It ain’t like that homie G. Plenty of money flowing around it’s not necessarily coming out of this guys wallet. Honestly the more money in the market the better.
He started with 40k
Will AAPL ever wake up? Black Friday perhaps?
How do I roll over PLTR 19.5c 20c and 20.5c 11/20 into next week?
The top. Of everything.
Why would you get rid of something you purchased to begin with? Also what club were you going to where Peloton was cheaper than the membership? I pay $27 a month and I get access to all the clubs locations. It would take 6 years of gym membership to pay off that bike. Gyms aren’t going away, you can get a gym membership for as little as $10 a month now a days.
Soros done selling?

PLTR hasnt even fuel'd up for liftoff yet, we are still accepting passengers to tendy town
SPY having convulsions all day
As soon as you buy calls
Had 11/20 Li calls. Sounds great except I bought them last Friday at the top. Tried to leverage down. They traded flat for so long that they got absolutely crushed by IV. Bought some 12/18 FSR calls yesterday that dumped this morning. They’ve got time to recover.
Dude what charts are u looking at. Jump in tech or EV
for fuckin real..
MY BOY NIO WILL NOT LET US DOWN 55 END OF DAY!!!! CHANT!! 55 END OF DAY!!!
yea wish i stayed in nio, left after +60% and didn't even consider XPEV and LI

Okay just hand me $1M and ill start to agree
MMs are goin to fuckin eat this dip...
Can't tell if you are being sarcastic but that's not how it works. Try it
PLTR needs to call in a fucking drone strike on a nuclear reactor or something and get some shit going.
these are the comments I need. Not omg my life is over I spent all my 100$ on pltr and its crashingggggg.
Super weird people are getting at me for this. Fucking Reddit educate auditors goddamn. Let me tease this sub in peace. I already know you want the fucking position.
this is a world i'd like to live in
I hate to admit...but a bull flag forming on BABA
Explain?
Have you guys seen the ridiculous price targets on Chinese evs? 300+ in a year
What kind of gains are we talking about? 20% or 2,000%?  


Maybe sell 2 to lock in profits and let the last one ride.

The one day I decide to jump on the bandwagon and get into PLTR and it falls all day. Fuck me.
Yeah I know that, but its just so *fucking obvious* at whats going on. Every single source I look up leads to some shitty scam clickbait sites
Shares are converting to amd at 1.7234x january 1st
I bought one. The market for these things is people paying $140+/month for cycling studios where they have to wear masks and book well in advance just to get a bike. 

People who are into cycling will do anything to keep doing it. Especially with more lockdowns and winter coming, it’s a no brainer. Never bet against cult followings. Been in shares since $27

Hahaha fuck me, im doing too much shit right now, I just hopped in a BABA play with a little extra BP but now it’s printing, what I meant to have said is where the next level of resistance would be if 270.5ish broke
Imagine forgetting the principle of fleecing as many people as possible
Hold, you’ll be ok
PLTR
I like all of the positions im in. Little sketched out by NIU but we'll see. Although it's super risky it's the first time I've been happy with my portfolio in a minute
Pltr has a ton of potential. It's earned contracts w/ the US government/military. Once they expand and foreign governments use their product it will pop off. 

Go read about it online and determine it for yourself. You don't want to take advice from 99% of autists in here (myself included)
Which ones
My crayons said it was a bear flag on SPY :(
Not looking forward to the bubble in my portfolio popping after bid ask spreads become realistic

Took profit thx

One of us, one of us, one of us! ....Minus being a billionaire.
Not shaking just curious, if something had happened or if its just a good as time to hop in
Bought XPEV when it went IPO at $22, sold at $23 after bing frustrated with it for about two months. It was just stagnant around $20.  
  
Now, I just cover my eyes in horror as it goes to the fuckin moon.
Just wait until new year resolutions kick.... pton will be on fire
Same, been loading up today. Just sold TSLA for more.
Did any retards here hit the WKDY earnings play?
Fair point but remember if the general public ever hears about how pltr knows who they're associated with then they'll freak out and there will be some fun hearings

Yes. Sucks not moving much today
Thinking about selling one of my apple stocks and trying to buy a put or call, what’s the move
Holding 12/18 40 and 45's :D
Don't do anything sexy. I'm holding 90% cash. 5% EBN and 5% Canadian telecom 

SU is good, but made too much too fast

I want to buy into air and cruise, but my dad said (basically) the market is high off of optimism and the might still getting the IRL effects of bleeding money.

Spx is at a high, so I don't recommend that.

I'm day trading with little money, to rack up some big boy XP
been saying the last 2 days it'll be $16 before $20

downvotes will confirm the hurt
Don’t worry bb, it’s still up 13+% for the week
Smart people don’t buy at the top we wait for dips and sell offs and there’s a big one coming for xpeng
MY GAINS FROM AYRO HAVE BEEN WIPED BY PLTR REEEEEEEEEE
Buying calls on any EV company. No matter how small, or meme like, is a sure fire way to make bank
Man I should've doubled down on $ARKK

Anyone have an idea when this will go public? And will this be on Robinhood?

"How can WSB have insider knowledge if we dont have any knowledge?"

Stay away from Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. Bought calls on all of them and they shit the bed right after.
Buy low and sell high 👍🏼 never fails to make money
this is so sad
I now have 10 shares of Amazon, time to gap it up pls Joff Bozos, make an Amazon military for hire or something idc I just want tendies.
I’m calling 1-2% sell off by market close today. Small bounce Monday morning with sell off going red by EOD.
if you take a post titled "i found the next ASDFFJH" as actual DD than odds are you should stay the fuck away. even if you called nio "the next tesla" i would call you an idiot
They do it so they can scoop shares on the cheap... tale as old as time

Bought PLTR calls so it should go down to 16 now
Worse than the $5000 Chinese electric car I saw on Fox News the other day
If you’re not playing xpev you hate money .14-> 2.00 today x50 lmaoooo
Need Ackman to announce something and it'll take off
What is wrong with you? EV was free money this week
Lmao lemme guess, you posted that
NIO FOMO
Same for SOLO. It is a retarded clown car that is up 50% this week. The damn thing only has 3 wheels!
Guys I hate to burst your bubble I’m a huge bull for Chinese EVs but don’t buy at the top seriously. Xpeng is going to have a pretty nasty drop back to the 40s this is too much of an increase in 1 week. Be careful and buy the dip, just trying to help.
because it goes up
Given that this guy makes more money than everyone else here using stocks instead of options, might consider changing up that mentality
Reminder PLTR has long term government contracts and incredible tech. It will rise significantly long term. Also don’t bet against Theil. I don’t agree with him on many things but the guy knows business.
I hope ur right. I got 19c 11/27 and leaps
BABA!!!
Because it’s a penny stock you apex retard
FVRR you're the only thing keeping me green today
NIO FOMO
show us your 50k gainz in 2 days or gtfo
Ten more days buddy.
CRSR 70 CALL
I just sold at $56.
Going short here feels too obvious.  Like it’s a trap being set by slight red and weakness
Anytime my guy, good luck!
Thats what they said when Telsa was $1000 this spring. Jump in the waters warm pussy.
Still time man. Save your day trades on robinhood for this shit if you're broke. This shit is going off pure technicals and hype. Most of these companies will be lucky to make money by 2025.

Buy morning. Sell before lunch. Rinse and repeat till your getting close to getting flagged.
Samesies
Man if baba gets to 280 next week that would be amazing
why do you like this stonk? is there a comparable company that is public? i dont get why this shit climbs 2-7% a day lol
I’m staying on the sidelines, it’s just fucking ridiculous. I have 100 NIO shares in a Roth from back when it was $13 but nothing else that’s going wild. Lots of tech. At least zscaler up nice today.
Don’t get bear trapped on PLTR

What a terrible week. Literally every play I've made has just hemorrhaged money. Think I need to sit on the sidelines for a while... Good luck to everyone else.
Perhaps because the closest strike available is a 1000% OTM
Love it!!!
Is it just me or has RH order filling gotten considerably worse?
everyone leaving NIO for XPEV this is amazing and hilarious
Buys the dip... Stonks continue to dip....
If you bough Dec 31 23c I might have sold you one 😂
The bikes are pretty sick, beats paying a gym membership in this covid crazy world.
BABA. Make the run to 300 please over the next 2 weeks. I will be greatly appreciative
Can someone explain to me why pltr is a good buy
Analytics company that hasn’t made money for 17 years vs. company that makes electric tricycles. Hard to pick.
nio is a winner? doesn't even make its own cars. worst shell company out of the 3. li is gonna replace nio next week just like xpev did this week.
Imagine thinking about max pain 🤡🤡🤡
Spy pump is so obvious. In 3... 2.... 1....
Dec 11th 300 call is up 100%, too bad I just bought one as my first option play :(
PLTR support @18 poggers
I would nut
FCEL super undervalued. may hit 10 in a month
Who let Kudlow out of the looney bin today?
those of you invested in Solo have obviously never seen their cars. You’re literally investing in the ugliest car in the world
True story, my mom was playing hide and seek with her siblings and hid in the dryer with her cat. Obviously my uncle takes a rest against the door and bumps the on button accidentally
Ah yes around $20 for a year considering that it IPO'd... \*checks notes\* yesterday. Brilliant.
Weeklies and monthlies. I think the last time I had anything was around earnings. So my dismay is probably because of that. I used to have shares but sold them all years ago. Kicking myself for that but made a profit on that though.
It’s ok donkey Kong take a breather, Monday we will jump into orbit
EV definitely fucked us all. But in a sense I do feel it’s a black swan event eg it’s not everyday shitron shits on something we own. That’s just my opinion but yea I do love CRSR and I’m actually gonna sell some of my NIO leaps and put them into CRSR cause I’ve had it losing sleep over chinese stocks LOL. Thanks for the confirmation bias bud
This isn't a dip you morons it's barely a few percent off ATH and it's doubled in the last month
shares brah
Ok I will explain everyone stuck at home on social media.  They are getting fat.  They get a peloton they get to lose weight and brag, fomo of other people happen and they order bikes.

I am so glad I bought the xpeng dip today
PSTH has been feeling like getting weird a lot lately. Bill SPACMAN definitely has something up his sleeve that we'll know about soon.
The fact that SPY hasn't fallen off a cliff after Munchkin talks and parabolic Corona cases is pretty Bullish.
fuck bro have you heard of picking up a phone and calling them? As long as your broker isn’t RH you can call to place trades lmao
Sir, this is a casino
God I wanna buy puts so bad but just feels like it’ll be another green week next week
My diamond hands on my baba calls is being rewarded handsomely. They came back from the dead
I don't care who you are. 0-1 DTEs are fucking exciting. Go from despair to elation to bargaining to prayer in the span of an hour.
I was told pltr would be 25 eom
Man 600 is what I have invested total rn but it’s split up, and like half is in a 12/18 50c on it. I’ve lost a lot of money trading stocks and options but my all time money in the account is like 1300 or something. Once I get out of my options I might just go shares on CRSR

Go long for years and this is an easy 50 bagger by 2025, never good to buy a position all at once though
ZM breaking out?
I have 20% of my portfolio on this, so both yes and no depending on your definition of yolo
Turn your phone upside down it will make you feel better
I'm holding out for the 3 o'clock pump.
Usually the case. People dip out then it shoots up.
AMH:

P/E of 110x, which isn't ideal. Price to book however is very good at less than 2. Asset to liabilities is great, almost 3 to 1. Earnings have consistently risen, save a slight dip this year, no doubt due to the Rona.

The extremely high P/E gives me caution, as does its profitability compared to others in the industry. Still, that Price to book, good asset-liability ratio, and solid earnings record could be enough to recommend a buy, but only short term. As for options, the stock is not particularly volatile, so I'd caution any strike prices above say 35 for December.
My account is starting to look like an ark fund lol

She doesn’t see things my way but silver lining here is her bf is siding with me for once so maybe he can convince her.

the crsr 12/18 $55c is beggin for a yolo
CRSR has had 6 green days in a row, giving me 0 chance to buy in without guilt
[deleted]
Same, but PYPL
ZM about ti break out
I am in IPOB as well, Opendoor will grab significant market share no doubt. However why not IPOC too, I climbed IPOB from 10-20 now it is time for IPOC. IPOD,E,F are close watches to, people who doubt Chamath / most SPACs just cause are ignorant. These are investment vehicles plain and simple.
Barely a loss
You did tho

Ewww careful what you ask for
Let's hope it touches 14 dollars today
Probably should have waited EOD to hop into PLTR
It’s gonna end the day at $18.50 which  is where it was bound to end up all week.
Those deep itm calls are wasted. Sell and buy otm calls. If you sold your nio and bought the same exp for say 50-80 dollar call, youd make way more money when the stock moves up compared to that 5.5 dollar call. Those ITM call options right now are pennies over the actual stock value. Or exercise the call and sell 20x covered call weeklies 15% over. That would be $1800 this week on nov 27 calls.

Xpeng is insane. I can’t keep sitting on the sidelines but I hate buying in after fucking ridiculous rallies too
Brothers and sisters, load up your calls for flight cruises and Disney bc vaccinee cominggggg. Trump said that too. So load it up and thanks me later

Samsies. Sold yesterday morning
Will the SPY ever have a -3% day? Ever ? Ever ?
XPEV is literally the most retarded stock on planet earth now. Holy shit
Come Monday we'll see if I'm an idiot for double downing on PLTR again I guess
[deleted]
nah , i only put like 10% of my account into it since it was such a new stonk. made 500% but only put in $525. Still great gains but imagine I went all in =[
Wonder how much the original CRSR DD guy made out with
gr8 day to buy 100 shares at open lmfao
TSLA $600 by Dec 18th change my mind
I had 2 x 45c.  Bailed early as well.  No reason why it just keeps going up.
this sale on PLTR is free money.
Portfolio is now 96 percent PLTR.
Shares my guy
IV falling on tsla
In case you haven’t figured it out... XPEV is the next NIO/TSLA
Max pain theory is dumb as fuck
Put a fourth into GME shares, a fourth into RKT shares, a fourth into PSTH shares and a fourth into RIOT shares. GME is what you'll sell first, then PSTH, then RIOT. Hold RKT for a couple years.
PSTH moving
EV bubble wrapping with people realizing it might be better to hold companies that are at least selling some cars.

WFH mooning. Solar mooning. Hard to tell if the hydrogen shit is wrapping up or still has legs, but the buying on PLUG and BE is getting really tired. Casinos, cruises, leisure, retail, and oil starting to sell and some selling hard. Gotta figure that shit is gonna crater unless more vaccine news can provide a pump.
Imagine parking your SOLO and coming back from shopping dildos for your gf to find an SUV parked on top of it

Imma blame this slow ass market on Mnuchin.. duhhh
[deleted]
soros is a hypocrite. He talks about moral issues with Palantir but like literally how did he make his own money? Certainly not at the detriment of others right? 

I'm hoping he dumps all his shares so that we can all buy them. Then, one day 10 years from now he'll regret it big time. Screw him
12/18 here, I was down 17% even when it was at 19.65
Hmmm amd tesla news today?
You hurt bra?
Yuh
Seriously? Goodbye to your money lol
CRSR might actually go $45 before EOD lmao
Because he wants to distance himself from them, isn’t that obvious? Please don’t tell me you think it’s some conspiracy for him to buy more shares...he has a 1% stake and bought the shares in 2012 when PLTR was private.
I’m holding strong on PLTR! Hoping for the best next week.
Not so good atm tbh
no fuckig clue
Upvote if your broker f’d you out of a 5 bagger
Wat they are the most retarted of all
[deleted]
Well, that escalated quickly...
For anyone retarded enough not to see it SOLO is being pumped on here by some fucking mouth breathers. They make trike cars in fucking canada, that's literally all you need to know to fucking steer well clear of.
I just have shares so idc
Spy 340 soon
Epstein used robux to pay child sex workers.
PLTR, you ignorant slut
hope PLTR gets govt contracts to find all this disgusting AOC deep fake pornography 🦶🏻
SPY IS SO WEAK WOW!
PSTH is doing that thing again
It's just Soros selling off some of his 18.5 million shares. As soon as he's done dumping, this bitch will be pumping again. It's the old dump and pump. Puts on the pump and dump strategy.
Look at Logitech as a comparison. As someone who doesn’t have money to buy long calls and has to do weeklies and started this week, I feel very confident in saying EV fucked me, but CRSR has a good trend and will likely keep climbing. Idk to what height, but we’re locking down again and people want pc stuff
I mean it seems like as soon as people remember that what peloton offers has been available for decades at a fraction of the cost I assume NLS will go up and PTON will drop.
Seems more transparent with USA media is my only guess

Xpeng stole the hype today by unveiling new tech for their car. NIO is more valuable long term but I like both of them.
Icic. So you reckon XPEV’s tech is all fugazzi?

Was really hoping for CRSR to dump so I could buy my dec 2021 45c contracts back. Probably going to be like 60 EOY 2021 at this rate. Didn't think CRSR was going to pop this much. Now that's gonna be some super missed out profits. X_x

its ***insane***, and its been this way for weeks now. No one has said JACKSHIT
I just said that bc it wasn’t options

Amazon could announce the cure for Covid with prime 2 day delivery and the stock would only go up .2% smh
I severely regret selling my baba calls for more SPY calls
no you're not. you're gonna dump 130$
CRSR FUCKING MOONING
ya'll saw nio.. xpeng.. these big stocks dip and jump back up last week

but naa don't buy the dip

PLTR baby
Pretty good.. I have 4,000 shares at 9.50
Wtf how is this labled DD?
Twilio ODTE 300p
Hhhmmm idk i feel like i have bad a luck..
Lol imagine buying a long position right before the dip today... like I totally just didn’t do this morning when the price was 18.88
200% on $ZM weeklies and it’s time for afternoon beers. Have a good day y’all.
pltr shares and leaps are the way.
What an absurdly slow trading day. very few people commenting
It's friday heading toward a holiday.
Aside from being a pump and dump run by a notorious fraudster and being totally dependent on the price of shitcoin which has no intrinsic value whatsoever..... is there any good reason not to go balls deep on RIOT calls?
Tell me FSLR isn’t sporting a Bull flag
Li and xpev literally to the moon
It has been one of those weeks where I’m on point with every move but pussy hands each one
SNE leaps
time to panic sell
why GIK?
XPEV is sickening. Why didn’t I long that fucker
Rotation out of memes into covid safe haven zoom
Nah dog-shit or cat-picking food ones are the go-to's
Nah its all downhill from here
Anyone in here was ever down 70% and managed to get positive again?
Isn’t CNK going bankrupt like AMC?
Congrats we all get that message once we’re flagged as degens
Today's top, maybe.
It be like dat fam stay strong
Sold boiii

Bet all profit 280c 27/11.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I had USO calls and they were definitely not the play
Maybe but the context of him dumping is not because the company won’t make money, it’s because they are evil lol
LOL
Ttd u glorious
Nope shares and hold for a few weeks
FUcking discoiunt !!!

buy!!
Imagine thinking a company that lost 20% of its share price in a month was overvalued when nothing has changed? lmao you belong here bro
Mad resistance at 17.5 on CCL, but they’ve got another dilution on Monday that might break it
if PLTR ends at $19 today I will convert to Christianity
Sr. This is a casino... we're degenerate gamblers.
PLTR
IV too high and shares still cheap enough that 100% shares will still be extremely rewarding
Support for PLTR @18
I already nutted though give me a few minutes.
Lucky bastard
Buy pltr dip!!
Cheers brother 🍻
I have 21 $30 11/20–let’s get nuts
Oh no guys PLTR dropped to 3 day old highs!!! Like if you bought 11/20 calls in the first place you were dumb. Still an easy hold, I’m buying more on this fire sale.
just random shit mooning as people unwind their positons
COME ON SPY! PUMP to 359 at least!
Right? I sold out yesterday, perfect time to buy back in
I've been taking a lot of trading courses and read some books too.
You are right thank you
Guys I have no money left, put it all in spy calls. I bought puts and havent won a trade in months
How is Roku a boomer stock?
I picked a wonderful day to go in on PLTR 🤡
Genuinely asking: why? Assuming they aren't lying on their earnings\* their P/E is lower than any comparable chinese company, let alone US company. The fundamentals of the company are solid, this is the kind of investment Buffett would love to make if it were a US company. The big issues are risks of:

\- international conflict

\- CCP intervention

The popular bear stance I see is that Ma insulted the CCP, which is the kind of thing that gets you 18 years in jail. However, BABA is a huge, publicly-traded company, and Ma isn't running it. If they butcher it, they'll kill foreign investor sentiment for at least 5 years. That seems very unlikely given that they have their eyes on global economic leadership.
buying the dip of course
still a good entry-point, just hold
DISCA guy is getting me rich Boomer Style 1% at a time

remember it for end of day 🤡
All these PLTR bears bought at the top. Chill

someone pump PLTR already I’m bored

Agreed but wasn’t it exactly like this when NIO had its run up? And it would’ve continued if not for shitron
Wish ipo filing 1.7 bil in revenue on 176 mill in losses I bet people are gonna FOMO into and in a year or two it will crash like Groupon.
CNK 17.5c jan 2022 free money
excuse me kind sir, BABA is up 3% on the day
Ugh ya silly move to make, now I don't even feel like buying 2021s
That's like whole basis for waymo, who is still likely the closest to full autonomy.
See you on Monday
Invest in a high quality webcam and some good lighting. When your on onlyfans bleaching your asshole you want to give your viewers the best experience. Labeling yourself 18yo Virgin will probably bring in more revenue.
Someone tell the lizard people we need a pump
aint gotta tell me twice, been in there like swimwear since $19
$22
BABA 300 next week
Someone explain to me how XPEV has been blowing by NIO? I don’t have any positions beyond old NIO shares, but I’m curious.
Congrats, now you’re an investor.
Are you holding through weekend? I got same shit but scared of IV crush
Everyone around my age and income seems to have one including me. It is less expensive than my club was and I don’t see myself ever getting rid of it even after lockdowns.
I'll probably get down voted for this, but put it in a mutual fund and consistently contribute to it. Maybe take 25% of it and gamble it on options. Keep saving and buy your first house in a few years. When you graduate college, or have a full time job, then you can start losing your money on options.
NIO is going to win in the longer run homie. Just wait till they unveil their new battery along with other tech they are working on. Xpeng won the hype this week, both are good companies but NIO will be higher stock on average in the coming year

What would be more beneficial? Shares or options?

Sweet!  Made a similar play off a recommendation here. I'm kinda new to options though. Is this something you will hold through the weekend?
I’m sorry you YOLO’d in PLTR at the top
The last few days, there were 13F filings showing big money flows into the stock and anticipation that Ackman might say something significant on the PSCM call. Those catalysts are behind us now tho.
It’s confusing and unclear in that of these law firms, I know that some of them are actually suing under claims that HDS is undervaluing their stock price. Whether this would make them negotiate up, thus leading to an increase in value, or accrue liabilities and damages, thus leading to a decrease, is unclear. Best bet is to go ask your wife’s boyfriend if he’s a lawyer, and ask him
😂😂😂
I actually think these will work out.
Ayyy hope this pops off.

I have $2.50c for Jan 2023.
We need to unite and tell FINRA that this 3-day-trades-in-5-days rule is bullshit. It's an arbitrary barrier to market entry intended to keep us poors poor. Poor gang rise up.

Dude, people are buying RV's and hot tubs like they are going out of style too.  Wait time on a new $15,000 hot tub is like 9 months.
Don't. If you really want to mess with the market, take a couple hundred dollars and play with it. Don't ruin your life savings at 17 years old.
It's Friday, sell off is bound to happen plus the whole thing with soros. It'll be up again next week
It's a way to say that you're the pro...
Someone tell me TSLA about to rally. Lie, idc.

Why beat him when you can join him?

Hey bro, same question, how can we tell if these are buys or sell?
Just realized I bought spy puts to early. This will go green by 2pm and then slowly drift about .2% red and my puts will mose 90% value

Same $20 11/27 Call, down 35% so far
oh dont mind me, just getting dipped on!
0dte fsly 85 calls bought right now, see ya on the other side
Dead cat bounce on PLTR, anyone else loading up on puts?
Good shit. Now only upwards from now on.
If SOLO can be worth 1Bil this thing is worth at least 400milli. I'm riding
Price too low imo
ArkK
dumb retail selling tesla to index
You can invest in me. Send me 3k.

Thanks.
Look at history on CRSR, if you have the money, it can only go up.
I like NIO and xpeng both but it’s honestly stupid how crazy high xpeng is today compared to NIO. Can’t wait to buy the dip though
Can't believe it fell all the way down to.. yesterdays opening price
What makes you think that? They just unveiled unrivalled tech that no one else in the market has yet (LIDAR autonomous driving)
In the 260 for $1 Wednesday out yesterday for $1.5 lol.  Rage
NIO and TSLA flat as fuck meanwhile Xpev is mooning to beyond
RUN is running
My price target is $100. Do it. Thank me later
Why Tesla going down?

You ain't go no alibi

You ugly 

Yeah yeah

You ugly
Haha, fucking perfect, get your calls in boys, shits going to be a green Monday
Diamond hands
SOLO flag complete.  Back up we go.
wsb is survival of the retardist
In a loss below 495 - any chance it goes up a bit or should i gtfo?
It could on Monday. Who knows. Wait for good price strength and confirmation before getting in.
Fuck all effect on price....
I see TLDR, I follow like a retard.
Puts on my self esteem
Averaged down 2x and just held on but we going to be rich now.
Hope that it will really be a 3/4 bagger in a few years. @16.5 holding
PLTR 21.5c 11/27
Can we not go flat that would be gey

Bears celebrating PLTR having a red day when they know next week is gonna be to the moon baby
Better to be thought a fool something something.
I'm limited on DTs 😂😂 I've been buying FCEL EOD and selling the next morning for some wild gains. Just happened to forget to buy in yesterday lol
i got a 360 for 11/23. I hope so
Roll DUMB ASS.. don’t take profitsz
Hold
PSTH jumping again. zero chatter on twitter. Must be just people not wanting to miss out.
Weed stocks are holding up during dips.
perfect time to buy more
Even 700 seems a bit high lol...
Up 3.6% for the day.....”dumping” $1 off the days high 😂
Why December expiration? Is there a catalyst coming up?
Buy high sell low is inevitable. Welcome to WSB
Yeah I 3x'd my position this week. Was down 40%, now overall up 20% with a much bigger asset
Full retard here... So the idea behind buying both puts and calls is that the puts are super cheap and therefore hedge against the "Utz goes up" bet at minimal cost?

What's the name of this technique?
To the top this goes
This bear bear needs it to. I've made so much money on my puts.
Same man same
I IT WAS ME
GME will most likely have short squeeze soon. Look at the short interest float. Cohen and Burry gonna rip it

tsla going 480
Experts?
You write like John McAfee 🤔
Anybody playing BEST or CRON?
Hello again! Are these Purchases?
I hate you I just bought the same call you did. Thank you
Lmao at PLTR support
need to break 357 rejected 3 times already
PLTR unable to break through $18.00, buy the bottom
Buying dip
Good job
what are some free money plays boys?
Lol someone come tell us it'll be ok.
356 retested
Who bought TSLA calls at 500$?  <--------
Isn’t it always green on Mondau
It's ticker is RKT. Sure, the company is called Rocket but the ticker says you're gonna get rekt

Thoughts on ciic coming weeks?
Tsla giveth. Tsla taketh
TSLA is being an asshole today. Thank goodness my side piece XPEV is treating me right
Who going cash gang? This doesn't seem right
[deleted]
Be careful with xpeng guys, that thing is going to dump big time before close or by Monday. Buy back in when it dips for sure
unsure, weekend will prob rise though
then I jinxed mine too?
ye of little faith, PLTR is far from done
Dont disrespect my sweet nio like that young man!!
keep shaking out paper hands pltr. we stand with you.
Sounds like something an old person would do
Don't worry boys, Mondays are always green.
GIK imo
Anyone think TSLA dips below $490?
I’m going to enjoy watching them burn.
Autism
US is pulling out of Afghanistan. No war no tendies
crazy that it hasnt found a bottom yet
How much can BLNK and SOLO grow
Sold TSLA at $700 (pre-split) after buying it at $620. Am I doing it right?
[deleted]
Fsly 0dte puts are so purty or wait are they?
come on bud, this is the part where you do your own findings. Cant look for answers for everything, go earn your prints. Look for anything EV, they're all UP

FSR SOLO MP CBAT LTHM FCEL NIO BLNK SBE RIDE
aight PLTR are we done consolidating now? jfc what a load of shit

Ngl might have to move over to Xpev instead of Nio on Monday if this keeps. This is pathetic. Theres simply too much Nio shares in circulation.
COTY is a company
If you don’t like her at her* bottom, you don’t deserve her* at her top. *”her” may contain traces of malignant omnipotent Skynet-AI
Longing around between 117-120 as usual
I guess XPEV is going to keep ramping into orbit.
u/Savethisvideo
Don't look at his profile guys.....
Both of you are gay
So what vaccine announcement we going to get on Monday, who's left?
Yea but I’d buy after the huge dump that’s inevitably coming
srsly ... why would people buy weeklies after a month of 100% growth LMAO
thank you for your service.
Partially cucked by RIOT today. WORK and BABA saved my greedy asses big time
Today is not gonna be good for me. Need to take a week off and just let my 11/27 sit.
U forgot Corsair
Soros didn't agree with their "business practices" ... They didn't say anything about their valuation.
XPEV really worth 55.55$??????????//wtffffffffffffff
Hey someone had to do it
All of these pumps and it went nowhere stocks just remained flat. Imagine the sell off without the six pumps we got. We got mnuchin, kudlow, pelosi, Schumer and even vaccine pumps. We got everything and the market stayed flat.
[deleted]
fuck man, every sensible stock gets pegged and all the meme stocks just fly, why do I keep buying the former, I must really hate money. But then again, I know that when I'll buy the meme, it will instantly tank or stay flat
God damn it fuck you.
Fucking wiped out a week of gains
r/accidentalracism
Think we’ll see 19.5 today?
I know but am afraid that this is one of those shit stocks, which has topped at this price and will never comeback up
Xi closed his BABA shorts today and got long. Get in
Are you doing weeklies? I think you could easily lose in that situation but i've bought and held shares and doing call leaps and i've consistently made profit every time
✌️
Did it really drop a whole 4.43% after a 80% run in a month??? Oh no.....
In my opinion yes, people are going to want in before earnings.

One vaccine news sends it packing though...
CAN WE BEAT SOROS?? THAT RICH ASS JEW HAS A LOT OF MONEY
$1
😂
 Be my guest.
 🧑‍🦽
Bought a 12/11c today 🤓
[deleted]
You realize people have been saying Tesla is overvalued since $250 pre split right?
PLTR isn't a miss yet, buy the dip today
Damn I wanna load up on tesla calls now
Spy bout to moon, I just bought 11/23 puts
Max pain is 18, watch your anus
This one is flying under Radar IMO - holding till merge.

* 1,250,000 | $270.40 | $338,000,000
BABA 265c weekly was a 10 bagger if you bought the dip
Now this is the kind of trading analysis I come here for
Get in GME before it’s too late
After it bottoms it will go up but once it tops out it will go down
PLTR just taught a lot of people not to buy weeklies lol
Baba dumping as predicted. Stupid clowns on here buying calls made it dump
LYFT being beaten senseless
Maybe
[removed]
Fuck yeah SBE gimme that thick veiny green dildo

Pltr sucking hard dick
Where is apple going next week
Just start the next baba 15m candle already pls
Yeah I think it’ll take a few weeks to ride back up to $300 but we’ll get there
yeh shit on my dick too eh? ffs
\>Tesla down -1%

\>HEY GUYS YOU BUYING THE DIP LIKE I DO?
Yeah kinda but YMMV
[deleted]
Bought BABA top lol
All
lol
Happened to me too. Her behavior was basically exactly what you described. Hoes gonna hoe.
And 7.5P/E! so cheap! They've ran up into earnings 3/4 last quarters. They're a great buy the middle of January IMO. Probably 25-30PT
dump coming. when? no one knows.
should hit $20 next week right?
Bruh you got shares not weeklies, just hold
idgaf what the "top" is today, i bought in at 9.50
Fax
Got 100 more shares today
You had me at free money
Ok I'll keep my eye out thanks for the insight.
If you're wondering why baba is going down now its cuz I got a call when it touched 270.5 😉
this is exactly what’s happening.
[deleted]
COME ON NIO FFS
Better jump on that 1.8% dip considering that Tesla is up 20% on the week smh
$SPY calls at 3:59 PM, 2 dollars out of the money. 100% is there gonna be vaccine news.
Give it a little time
Ban
Hope so I got a third of my portfolio in at 258.
people surprised that things do happen 😂
It was around two days since the creation of that $PLTR DD thread, when MMs realized it's time to make that phone call.
Ditto
Get it 🚀
Fuck this market, pick a direction already and do it faster
Weekend at Soros'
Chamath>Buffet NextGen$$$
Cause they are poor
only sources ive found all lead to some clickbait Pump&Dump sites
Yup why did a oost about this get seleted
Where my KNDI bag holders at. Anyone buyin the dip? or u gtfo.
A bear doesn’t feel disappointment. All they feel are the incredible highs when the stock market turns green, and the murderous rage when it turns red.
If it falls, it will be a dip and you should buy again
There’s still time, we will see, also GME wouldn’t get banned, I would
The train is making a stop for y’all to get in
On Monday, who knows. Long term it's a buy the dip and accumulate stock.
XPEV hitting 57-58 today?
Zoom out. It'll be back to $290 before you know it.
i dont think its too late. Clean energy and EV seem to be the current bubble
All in on BABA
ZM

I feel that, holding onto my December calls as well🤘🏻

this xpeng car looks sick tho
Friday has always been a premium kill day for Tesla.
it's not a different story... it's the same fucking story. 

If this guy has $100M and he puts in $1M, what the hell is the difference than a guy like me who has $100 and buys the 4 piece at Wendys??
Yess FUV was a quick $1500 yesterday & today
I bet women that make a lot of money have huge gaping holes
Not good enough 😖
Well I didn’t buy the “top” of the baba run.... but I was very close to it
Sometimes i think this guy is Michael Burry's troll WSB account
Lets go for a half yard on those treasury bonds
any weed stock
Well, I bought a wedding venue right before the pandemic. Want me to weigh in here on your comment and how off it is??
i know. i want them to make some tendies. hopefully they feed me one or two .
Not with black Friday here
[deleted]
Holy shit that would be insane. Thanks for clearing that up, I’m not well versed on the subject. What kind of propbably is there for something like that to happen though?
FCEL gonna break 6
Monday we seein another vaccine pump?
[deleted]
Tesla ATH got rejected earlier today. If you hold those you are very dumb
Im all in BLNK, time for it to drop!!!
Probably more like $700
Obviously I'm not getting to a mil with 7k just looking for some nice gains :)
OP will offer to double down if this hits 10 cents.
This is the way.

Well, or April calls
AMD slacking. Hope my 12/4 86 calls will be ok
And I bought PTON top 😭
Right but him announcing that he's going to would drive out other investors right? I'm pretty retard so I could be wrong too
PLTR leaps didn't actually get crushed that badly. Seems theres still tons of confidence.
Tbf whats the diff between $18 and $17 when it will hit $40 2021
PLTR doing a RKT 😂😂😂😂
Options Expiration date today. Trying to keep it under $13 because can't keep it under $12 now. 

We need a push to like $13.35-$13.5 and they would quit fighting it.
whoever can time the puts on these EV scams will retire super rich
Think 113p Apple 11:27 reasonable ?
I'm already in PLTR at 10.40 lmao
hype stock, slow business model - there will be dips
Lol duuude xpeng chill you’re not Nio what do you think you’re doing with all that big dick energy
it's up 2% dude
Better than what the CCP did to jack ma's bottom.
FUCK tsla come on man
Other than TSLA, does any stock seem particularly overvalued at the moment?
I sold them out of fear an hour ago but I bought them like 2 weeks ago
Fuck, I forgot to buy yesterday EOD
[deleted]
It’s not even degenerate. It’s just smart.
But I heard you do refunds. 😈
XPEV saving me from my TSLA foolishness
BLNK EOM?
You’re right and I’m sorry
Great buy tho, payday will come, hold next few months
Maybe don't buy calls after a 98% monthly increase in share price
yup . price dropped like 20 extra cents right after I bought in today but this going to 20+ anyways
Plz don’t tell me this is the end of BABAs run
This shit can't be real?
Never actually thought about a mil. Just looking for some nice gains. Maybe someday though lmao
I hope we go green by close just to shit on bears who are on full parade lmao
You clearly must be retarded
Roll baby
I have way too much in SNE... I am a bit worried
Its pretty easy. Not very exciting tho
wym tanked, this is a spac
PLTR we are on the way to the moon, were just not worried about getting there fast

Harvest some tendies and roll it forward. That’s what I’m doing on NIO and PLTR.
Down bigly on tsla 535 12/4 questioning my hands. Tesla bulls how we feel
Baba easy money
Yolo is the reason I’m 1.5x!
Take profit dude...
oh wtf BABA I went to drink!! 🙄
0dte on a Chinese EV 

ayy that rhymed
Entire market going up on super low volume
calls...
You get nothing tard.
Thanks man. I only got in the market in August after constantly putting off getting a brokerage account (it's harder for me because I am not based in US). So this will be my first big win. :)
Just hold. They will be over 50 by this time next year
Yea I’m getting super emotional with this move and pullback buts that’s why I went out to 12/4 and 12/11. Also have 2/19
now i see how people can be spectacle on RH
I dont think so, high potential
Retard is as retard does
Dang that hurts. Those contracts are probably worth at least 10x more.

There will be other opportunities though.
PLTR is killing me today. The one time I decide to go into weeklies instead of leaps
Im new to this, what does that mean for the market
contemplating buying FCEL calls
Jump in retard
EXRO rocketing up all day...y'all shoulda gotten in when I told you to...
You need to pursue education! And not the one that costs $$$ if you don’t have it. $10 an hour is not enough to make $ in this game as well. Try Real Estate, Computer Science, these are skills to learn without college that lead to great $$$ careers.
How could you've lost on $TSLA? Don't tell me you went 🌈🐻
You can get BKNG 0dte puts at $2010 for ~$4. No chance this closes above $2005 today. It’s Friday, with covid cases on the rise and lockdowns imminent, with the gov telling people not to travel, and here is a travel stock close to ath’s.
It is with this dip
Hold monday green
1000shares in sumo let’s fcking gooo
All in pltr shares right now
Literally one study that is based on tests that haven’t undergone peer review. Every other study is showing masks do help prevent spread. Are you gonna believe based on a single study, or all the other studies that say the opposite?

Exactly.
Price target: tree fiddy
yep, agreed, I back them. Does anyone have an idea though on institutional interest? I'm curious as to why thus far the stock hasn't overall really gone steadily up or down, are institutions ambivalent?  slowly building positions? where can I find out what institutions hold FEAC?
And i thought my 4 calls were bad
I'm sorry, but thank you
Boy did you just buy the top? lol!

They're shares, average down.
I think today is going to be one of those days where people end up saying:


1) I was fucking retarded not getting into PLTR at $10


2) I was fucking retarded when I missed my second chance of getting in below $18


It’s ok to be retarded. Just don’t be extra retarded.
she will comply soon
will be 25 eoy!
Could print. Lockdown means mess activity and less lyft usage.
PLTR dip
Why are we pegged at 356.5? MM fucking both sides
Definitely not
Hawaiian Luau is already in walmart
Max pain is 270 for BABA I’d wait until EOD if you’re going to hop back in
LIDAR blows
NIO I thought you were the chosen one....what the actual fuck, guess XPEV was the mvp all along
There is your issue. Make your decision stock specific. Not previous experience specific. Gauge what the stock is doing. Is volume picking up? Is there any bad news? Are you going to use that money somewhere else if you sell? Ask yourself these things. Don't say this happened to me with AAPL last week so I'm going to sell. If you have rules like taking profit at certain percentages this won't happen either. If its 20% then you sell every time you hit 20% and yoy won't be upset about decision because its your rule. Listen, I'm not perfect either. But I remind myself of these things every trade. Reasons why I bought and sold. Take BABA yesterday for example. Stock hasn't been volatile lately, took a massive hit and looked like it found a bottom and started gaining speed. Maybe you sold because you fucked up a TSLA trade last week. But thats a totally different stock so your reasons for selling would have been different. And BABA yesterday had momentum, looked to be on the way up so maybe you think ill hold this one and see.  I dont know if I'm making sense anymore but hope it helps.
When are they announcing the contract? I have 2 for January. Will there be tendies or not?
Hell yeahh 11/27 270c 🍆🍆
Going to be rolling in tendies
I think they release information this upcoming week? don’t quote me tho
Always make the worst trades after taking a big hit in either direction, + or -. Always
I would be surprised if it didn't go to $15. Even then it's over priced for what it is. (please don't sprout garbage about data to me, it's literally my fucking job)

Yeah for calls longer than EOD/EOW 😂
Wait for it to go back to $25 then sell it.  The closer to the strike price the better it is... trust me, I’m a genius.
Why did you have to say 14 man, i need you to go out there and spread the message of GME not get banned :(

Its going to suck in here when the VIX dies. No more volatility means no more sweet sweet options premium. The bears are doing the bulls a service every dip
I want to party with your cousin
This
Merger with BFLY was announced this morning... I was not involved in the decision 2 days ago, sorry.
I have 6k. Whats the most degenerate move you can think of?
Average down but holy fuck let that serve as a reminder to not buy into FOMO
Here another stupid question... what’s with the number flair?  So many have it and I have been wanting to ask but don’t want to get flamed. 

Now that this is a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply perhaps it will be buried enough and I won’t get shit on for asking.
What do they do
tek is ded
Wait till PLTR comes down to $5 or jump in now?
HBO Industry is not bad tbh
Well obviously hold
Got in at the beginning of the summer. I’m quite pleased myself.
It seems the stock price drops as soon as it reaches $13. They are really trying to keep it beneath that amount. Hmm
I'm up 70% just on stonks in two days

This is just the same dip we saw last time PLTR hit 19, just wait it out
Yea idk what happened. Usually this sub has all good advice
0DTE FASTLY $84 Puts are $.20 right now
GO NIO YOU PIECE OF POO
Coke and strippers
🙋
or any other pharma company for that matter right?
I told you guys to short PLTR this morning you didn't listen
It wont go back to $17.00, next week is $20 you can !remind me if you want
Wish I was smart enough to be theta gang
I am once again asking for GME to short squeeze
Is it going back up Monday?
Spy been a bitch today
I will be so happy if NIO hits 55 next week
Nerds
This move is big but also it’s only like 4%. Once we know the domestic relationship is normalized it’ll climb to 290s. Need to consolidate for next leg up too
Too late to buy into xpev??

what news?

Let’s assume the market runs up until Christmas on stimmy fumes, but bipartisan action doesn’t occur until 2021. Does that mean we’ll be having a massive dump after Christmas sales figures are released?
it's called hedging you retard
yessir
BABA dip
Idk wtf is up with Microsoft/Sony but I just talked to a dude at GameStop and they’re straight up just not sending them consoles. They said they might have *one or two* for Black Friday.
VXX creeping upwards
Nah its crashing at 3pm. People are extremely cautious atm and will want to go cash over the weekend

I would close any of your bullish risky positions at 230 today
In 100 shares of PLTR at 18.95 🙃
😨😨 whats he buying next week?
FSR comeback is fake. Get out while you can boys
I believe its just getting started. the merger was announced 6 hours ago. initial pump is in.
Yeah but clover has a ton of baggage.
Buy the dip lmao
Maybe. Not likely, but maybe.
nvidia papa huang please give me 540 EOD, not asking for much
Invested in shitcoins a week ago and I’m up 60% alfuckingready
if SQ breaks 200... valhalla time.
At least i knw im not the only one who got fkd with pltr
I feel it will pop next week. 270 is a strong resistance
Yea sell monday/Tuesday. Check your theta/IV to make your decision. If BABA moves another 2-3% you will still make money but not much. So if you Wana play it safe sell end of today, or hold and sell early next week for more tendies. For people coming in BABA, please buy contracts further out than a week lol, this could potentially go till 350 next year
Double down on PLTR right guys?
Probably a combination of MMs needing to kill calls and also PLTR employees trying to eat by selling their vested shares “at the top”
Rest of portfolio status: moon mission engaged.
AMZN status: depressed single mother on food stamps
I see PLTR is taking BLM seriously. It's doing an early Black Friday right now.
Cause is subjective
Im holding till im green or expire idgaf
Yeah I’m just going to log out and hold my 525c over the weekend
Congrats bro👌👌
"if youre bad youre bad" no shit
Spent too much money on NFL commercials
well obviously it's going up for 2 weeks. duh
"oh no this stock that has risen >100% over the last two weeks is down 4% today time to panic" 

you clowns all buy at the top like usual?
Ok say it with me “IM A FOMOING AUTIST AND I DESERVE TO BE BROKE” 


Fuck I make some stupid calls when I’m up on cash.
I agree, not sure that the number for Q3 will be pretty, but they should be able to tell a convincing narrative about what the business is doing.

They could shares preliminary numbers for sales in Q4 to drive some excitement about how fast PS5 and Xbox are selling out.
Its very funny as they bought 3M shares on that same exact day..
exactly. shaking out the weak hands.
It’s a fake.  It’s always a fake

You have a beautiful presentation for your DD posts that you know people wont be able to resist. I was in for PRPL now im in for UTZ. Ultimately when i stayed in PRPL to long I ended up getting fucked on a nice comfy mattress. If UTZ fucks me im getting fucked on a pile of chip crumbs and disappointment....... 10 4/16/21 22.5c lets do this. There will 100% be a spike leading up to the holiday for hippies!  


Also forgot to add: The Voodoo zapps are the best chips i have had in my life..... Grabbed them because the bag looks cool one day and learned the way of New Orleans chippin'.
Yes it will move -15%
XPEV and SOLO took the limelight today. NIO is the corner cuck watching 💦👀 and so am I
290-295
There's ZERO Bids on the Call Options and its been this way for weeks now and no one has said a thing
I thought y’all said PLTR was free money?
Options expiring going to crash tesla. Too expensive to excersize the contracts
PLTR dip getting juicier by the minute
You ain’t got to lie, Craig, you ain’t got to lie
Haha awesome

Yeah but the backend problem is scale. Your buyer pool is limited and ev's tend not to fall apart as quick. Long term fundys are poor.

Bro I'm telling you this stock has been consolidating on $18 since july. Last time it did a big squeeze, was in 2013, right with the previous console cycle. They have record sales and their last ER beat with 500%. The stock not moving doesn't make sense.
My cousin is an MM
So puts again just like back mid September
proof?
I missed out on 1k on potential profit

Perfectly normal to bring a lawyer to any hearing. Same reason you get a lawyer when being questioned to a crime there’s no way you could of committed.
PLTR buy the dip !
lmaooo i think they are helping you keep you money with that one
Profit taking; it was up like 30% this week.
refuel at $17 and then take off
Ok holding my 108 12/4 call then
CRSR I’m sorry to have doubted you I love you 💕
WSB with the pump and dump on PLTR. 😅😅😅
why’d you put it in thetagang lol
Holy shit, $CRSR just absolutely shattered the resistance point of 40$
I always laugh at people with stop losses set. You know you're losing money right?
She got some receding hairline on that forehead
Has yet to announce.

Sell next week if/ when they do.

Then PFE will say their vaccine is really 105% effective.
BABA gang where you at? We watched on the sidelines the last week but we’re back baby 🤑
Negative news about Co vid around 10am, right on schedule. Load up for power hour. 1pm for you East coasters.
PLTR 11/27 20c’s on this dip, hopefully a quick day trade near close or see what Monday brings
Is this a sign? Red monday coming?
When the blue line hits 1% or zero, stocks are expensive. When it hits >2%, stocks are not expensive.
are you a masochist? Why put yourself through this? How many times will you face the crushing feeling of defeat before you give up?
They’re doing that just because it’s your cake day
Always think about this haha
Bro the comments on the video are the funniest thing ever.
The “people also own” section for this on RH reads like a WSB greatest hits. Fuck it, I’m in
You son of a bitch, I'm in!
baba
3:50
Lol to fake BABA resistance at $270. Will be above $280 by next week.
Tbh dont think it going below $17, i mean, the big support was at $18.30 and when it went down to $17 insta dip bought.

If i was you, i would have bought in that 17 dip in seconds
I'm in Palantears.
Woof. Woof bro.
This.
no shit. small world. ok w/ rainy weather...i live in seattle :)
Goodluck
will there be any end of day fuckery to reward fd holders or do the market makers have spy pinned. i guess we will find out pretty damn soon. good luck to all
[deleted]
move NIO you god damn boomer stock
Hold baby - market cap on this thing is tiny. It needs to hit the 30s to even match SOLO and it has much better potential. 

Ton of risk on this but I’m going diamond hands.
Has gore in it, all in. 

Also prove it’s a yolo
You're up 30 percent on the day fwiw
Then I will also have some chicken nuggets please.
Same
Yeah not too concerned about it.
Yessir!
whoa spy cliffhanger...like the game in price is right, that guy is going off the edge!
my account just went red for the day after being up 2k... bag holding a shitty stonk called workday after buying the dip hard, and it dipping harder lol
They have been public for a long time with only the preferred shares trading under TSLRP. They sensed you retards would buy this up so decided to IPO and pay off the preferred and pay down debt.  They sell software to the government and also won an award to administer theTSA Precheck program and do background checks for CMS.
Bought at $1.92 sold around $6.80
Nope. You dont get it if you get fired with cause
I hate it too, I was bitching about the same thing earlier. When options are right around $3.00 the $0.10 increment seems like a lot too.
12/18 $10c Solo - someone just placed a $700k bet on this option.
Ok. I'm in on NIO. If it moves anywhere from +5% - +20% next week, I'm very happy and done for the year.
Shut the fuck up you spineless pussy
Up to you but since your in for a quick win, I’d say $10 would be a pretty good exit
It will
Monopoly money?
[deleted]
Whew man.  I can't wait.

&#x200B;

The crazy thing is that retail/wall street still thinks its going under in a year like blockbuster (when blockbuster couldn't even make monthly payments on loans, but GME can pay off 125 million early).  So not only do we have 70 million shorts to squeeze, but possibly another 70 million as they keep shorting on the way up
Same with NIO man. it's the WSB effect. When we talk about something too much it'll go down. But just diamond hand it brother it will go back up!
This shit makes me depressed
I tried it at gym pre-covid and enjoyed it.    good workout.
U think its dumping more next week?
SPY stuck in between 356.5 and $357 which will break first

I have shares and setting a trailing stop-loss to secure gains. In my opinion there is still a lot of room for it to go up, so I’m not selling until it dips and stop-loss triggers. Q4 earnings should be amazing and they’ll most likely be positive earnings
Should have went with ayro
This is the way
If you have paper hands trading is not for you
Is this the dip of the drop?
Just picked some up doggie
Buy pltr dip
HEAR taught me the meaning of capitulation in Spring. Never again lol. Although they do trade in 2 year cycles. Big game release/new console drives new headset purchases. Actually you might be on to something
have you heard about the new peak? peak peak peak!
Lucky!
Load up on SONOS imo. Had a huge run up and cooled down today. Christmas and lockdowns coming up 🧐
that's called selling.
i don't even care at this point, make me feel alive!!!
If you want to play oil find a company that also has alternative energy plays - which means names like Shell, Total and Equinor

Damn... why did you have to bring reason into the equation?  That makes it harder for me to bitch.
Stop loss hit for PLTR.


Buy order set at 17 and will grab calls eod
Bought into pltr, just down from here boiz
What's funny about PLTR is that it was my only hope at turning my portfolio around.
Sir this is Wendy’s
You don't have enough money.
Yeah it’s everyone else’s fault you went way OTM on a slow growing stock
PFE used the colder storage to ensue results, very likely it fine stored at higher temps as well.

PLTR taking a dip.
This is the way
Yea I agree.. just need to time the sell well. Wsb always buys at the top.
But why AZN?
would love some action before the last five mins

I think we've all had our fill of people trying to monetize WSB.

Hope this is accurate. I’m in

So like... tsla 800 calls... maybe, JUST maybe... not saying you have to... but i would sell those after S&P inclusion. Just saying. Fuck you tho.
What time does TSLA moon today?
Friendship ended with PLTR  


Now XPEV is my  best friend

&#x200B;

Just kidding balls deep in both
would be great if you could just put your position on "hold" for a bit until it stops going down
To all you that said hold pltr ur mom a hoe
Holding PLTR till at least January. Today sucks but doesn’t really hurt much.
# Where is the retard that is going all in with $50K on 0dte SPY calls at the end of today's trading day? Are you ready to go son?
SNOW opened like 300% higher than it should have. Had it opened at the expected price it'd be over 100% by now.
Lemme know too so I have a chance to get one right
Asshole delivery at home smart ass Failer u poors
Gonna buy some PLTR calls EOD
Obviously

Hek yeah

With your luck it will max out at 19.99 florida style.
It’s evil.
Buy whenever it's below 20
Not enough FUBO talk on this bitch

PLTR is getting out of hand... needs to stop or a lot of people will panic sale and then we fckd.
The accuracy...
I bought in today 😂👍
Volatility is crazy
Nice I fucked a tranny raw and tought I got her pregnant
Im not celebrating its definitely going up just not today. I just want to know the retards who bought it when it was up 20% for the week. Lol
In Tdoc filling my portfolio with gains
Heh, that is almost my play but I actually have the diamond hands. I have $133k of shares and $23k in Feb 270 calls.
Shit PLTR below $18
Haha cheers man! It's friyay! 🥃 🥃
[deleted]
But imagine if you bought calls
Meg on CNBC.  I think she’s a 6/10 what about y’all?
Well I may have just gone full rarted, after a big fat red day decided to yolo all my spare capital into late Dec PLTR calls while they’re on sale.

If this doesn’t pay off I’m out boys ✌🏻
If you think baba is going to go back up you’re retarded
It’s my 1st call with Tesla
I hope not lol
PLTR, every drop is faster than the last and it wont stop. Down over 8% in less than 3.5 hours.

HUGE BUY IN SOLO JUST OCCURED.  SOMEONE PLACED A 700k bet 12/18 $10c

you're wasting money you could've wasted on options

Wow PLTR really drilling
I'm not a professional, but we may need a ticker and strike to be sure.
Same 200@15 just chilling, might buy more and join theta gang
Why? Rather low volume.
What in the fucking fuck did I just witness with my bear eyes
Buy GME you nerd
[removed]
So why is PLTR dying? Did everyone load up on 11/20 calls
Buy back in ASAP
I  think that's called a pharmacy
I see the trade sizes on PLTR selling.  26 shares. 5 shares. 9 shares   ITs moving down but its shaking out weak hands ...just like last time.
FCEL and SPI too
As I’m sure you all bought Baba 300c 11/23 like we planned then it’s a great weekend for the whole sub.
🤚
Lol. I try to limit my sodium intake. Healthy kidneys is the ultimate ten bagger
All in FSLY puts
buy the dip!
A weekly now will have big payoff potential
Sold covered calls on all my green stocks at the beginning of the week and that's the only shit surging right now, because of fucking course
https://www.zdnet.com/article/durex-sos-condoms-go-flaccid-over-batman/
keep dropping PLTR so daddy can load up on Monday when fund is available !!!
SNAP!!!

Bought more of those today, expecting big print
is papa elon done dropping? should we get in now to buy the dip?
I hate money.

Lol -97% in 2 weeks
Lol someone’s fussy
Hey I just bought some calls for January. Is USPS really going to announce by EOY?
You buying the new Ratchet and Clank anytime soon? I'm gonna get a PS5 way later
This was so obvious with the emerging lockdowns, I got in last Friday with a 11/20 call and fucking lost money on this, and this morning when I sold it so it didn’t go worthless, it fucking exploded. Why did it take so long for this to moon, it was so obvious, of course it goes right after I sell for a big loss. FFFFFFFFFML
PFE looks too low to me imo
The amount if whining pumping in here is pretty annoying
Cheap leaps I’m hype
[removed]
PLTR support at $0
Should sell nio eod?
Analysts are trash.  When GME got the revenue sharing agreement with MSFT (basically large amounts of free money for gamestop)....BofA LOWERED the price target to $1.6 a share.

&#x200B;

Turns out they have a huge short position they took out to cover a loan to gamestop they were expecting a default on.  Now they are super underwater on the short position.  Almost seems like a conflict of interest or something
I looked into this a lot last night. Bought in today. Let’s see how it goes... only concern is in short term that Q3 earnings might cause a drop (Q4 would be good most likely though). That might help shorts close positions.. unless RC makes some moves. The short position is insane here. The talks have the squeeze have been going on for a very long time but with RC and Burry on board now the catalyst may finally be here.
Clearly thats why I’m asking where should I go
THIS is a post I can get behind.   BYND $250
Baba 300 eoy, we going right back
triple bottom on the spy daily? might just buy a shitload of 11/23 calls and try to sell eod if spy starts pumping
to many gays buying this shit car stock
PLTR giving me flashbacks to RKT. Diamond hands!!
Normally I'd try to clown on you for buying shares.  
  
But you're clearly a patriotic chad with a massive dong.  
  
Carry on.
Tomorrow too
Holding. Hoping to see it hit almost 300 by next Friday.
I’m standing on the stool rn

Oh SNAP. Cha-ching
I sold the next morning at 9:54 once it hit the strike price I gave. I’m not retarded enough to let theta eat away at my options over a three day contract. From the comments it looks like some people who followed made out as well
Are they a bigger fraud than Sino Forest and Luckin at this point? The destruction of this one and YY would be fun to watch - if the shorts can pull it off.

Congratulations to whoever got puts for the earnings dump. Paid off well!
Yeah probably dip through Monday before further run up.
Im not gonna fuck with it unless it falls back to 450. I was tempted to sell my shares at 500 and wait for a big dip to buy back, but its TSLA and that bitch can go from 300-1000 on any random day
I love this song/video (and remix) and this is the best use of this in a meme omg
Selling my AMD calls to buy BABA calls this morning is the most calculated shit I've done all quarantine.
PTON just reloading
Who’s buying spy weeklies and what
Thanks for the additional info. Seems like this could be a potentially decent long term hold if they execute well.
Postmates already do that
Holy fuck PLshiTR

I know the run up was crazy, but goddamn these sellers have wide pussies
BABA puts right now for so much gainz
If anybodys worried about PLTR just look at wednesday-thursdays graph. $ 19 EOD
It burns

PLTR bulls getting the stool and rope ready
oh yeah lol, been staring at zm charts for too long
Why do some options have to trade in $5 increments and some don’t?

I have PLTN 11/20 covered calls at $.01 right now that I would love to close out so I can get ready to sell 11/27 covered calls during the afternoon pump but minimum bid is $.05.  It’s not much but on 10 calls that’s a loss of profit of $50 as opposed to letting them expire at 4pm.
Perfect
I'm just gonna have my 1 year old pick what stocks I buy at this point
I love this
Amazon slowing driving me into a pit of madness
Also congrats the the perfect timers who bought this week lol
Who's buying the ANT ipo?


Ok then stop being retarded and just buy baba now.
Short term, sure, long term? No way.
BALY all time high load for monday
Lol you must hate money
lmao
Imagine having Pltr leaps but fucking bored watching .30 to .50 cent moves
You too! Agree valuations are crazy but just like lulu they'll probably make some acquisitions along the way. It's a pure Becky stock with a cult following and  Covid definitely accelerated it's growth but I see them sustaining it.. They just got Beyonce on board for her fitness routine and Biden basically said he uses it for his home workouts.. Look it up.. Nls was another stock for home workouts but with the news of the 2nd round of lockdown,  it didn't move at all
Somehow all my positions have gone from green at open to destroyed.
This is the way.
Enough with the BS stimulus no one cares
Just bought 250 peanuts fuck yea pltr
I like how anyone pumping PLTR get like 10 upvotes instantly.... almost like bots are in here
Let me hold $60 I want the new Call of Duty
WTF? My $T is green? That never happens
Riot and MARA need to bounce back, I went long again on BABA
Better not. I finally got in on some weeklies. I may be a little late idk though
Fuck you. 

In the ass.
every single human being involved with the SPY price action today should be fucking ashamed of themselves
Its going to trend up towards eod. Monday it will be around 19, and we will see 22 by friday. Their will be dips, but its going to trend up for one more week. Use this info as you please. But thats my play

Well, not as retarded as you but still with you with 10: Bag holding 10 11/27 TSLA $500c cost basis $20.xx for the lot ... sigh. You holding?
keep pumping BABA guys thanks
AZN calls now
watch stocks all day and throw your life away, that's what I do. Your timing will improve dramatically
Babaaaa
use log
Yeah they got tanked
I sold BABA too early...
Algo inverse WSB but I don't think they get nuance. Hopefully this tells them to dump the money in.
Please tell me my $21 11/27 calls I bough 40 mins ago are safe. I’m pretty sure they are I just need some reassurance lol.
the moment someone buys, another sells, and both think they are astute
this is terrible
Enjoy the 30 bucks
#shambles
Just give it some time, they are gonna pump high
Pltr down 4%

The fuck y'all whining about lmao
Literally all of them
>Only the PFE vaccine requires those types of fridges. The MRNA and AZN don't require as cold storage.
calls on $BIDET
Dunno man I got shares.
Or less
$ROPE

Jk just diamond hands this bitch, 20 by eow next week easy
#BABA 🤤
if im flagged for PDT and open a daily, will the auto-exercise restrict me from placing trades?
Hold on tight bois we’re going doooownnnn
Should have sold 15 min after open.
BALY YES YES
Lmao. The best technical indicator available
Sell at close
[deleted]
bought shares too, cant trust this ticker with options
You should see their cars, straight ass. Looks like a street buggy from Vietnam, ass
Yeah. Flat as fuck. I'm still holding though
Kind of. Look at the option profit calculator. It’ll guide you to profits and understanding intrinsic value.
Touché
Yeah, basically the shorts couldn't hold the beast back any longer. It's going to 300 and nothing will stop it.
Can’t oil just fucking die
How you figure?
Lmao Pelosi and the democrats literally stopped the stimulus talks before the election so it didn't help Trump. But nah its only the Republicans
Imagine not caring about daily price action on PLTR because you're already up ~250% on longer dated calls.  
  
Oh wait I don't have to.
Just posted mine and got shunned by WSB, so yes it's a good idea.
I totally can’t find it
We’ll see - definitely too soon to celebrate as I definitely ain’t selling yet.
Where’s spy going up or down to for 11/23
Anyone still holding 11/20 baba 270's? wonder what they are worth now.
Conviction in your positions, wait for a dip
thcb
Analysts said 20%
I have calls for 04/16/2021 strike price 270, break even 295 shall I sell them now? Just looking for small profits.

Do you think it can go back to 256?
SPY 353 EOD
ZM breaks 445 it’s going to moon
Shhh. It doesn't look good for me, but I bought UAL calls based on their picks and I made a decent $1,000 gain, compared to the $3 one of them made with UAL shares. Now they are asking me for a commission.
Quit limping NIO you 🇨🇳cunt. Look at your brother XPEV cuckin the🌈🐻.
What part of this is exactly a bubble? Which automaker besides TSLA is overvalued?
Agree with /u/Stonksflyingup on prices a year out.  I think 20 EOY is reasonable.

If there is a vote and share recall, its pretty impossible to guess, but it could be well over 100 theoretically
everybody knows this, you're just retarded
I just got even lol. Loaded up on270c at .2 out of pure rage this morning. How high we going.
I'm a fan of Ant-Man and hearing about Alibaba with ANT then you cant go wrong with that!! 🤑
Looks like a nice grower, whats good about them?
Baba’s volume is pretty low for only three hours left. Gonna moon all day or sell off end of day? Who know who cares my calls are printing and we seeing 300 next week

AYRO gang we holding over the weekend?
BABA it is
Ok 👌. Good luck
So if I’m in at 7 you think I should pull that baby out if it hits 10 or so? Was looking for a quick win and saw how it been going the last couple of weeks.

How to stop trading like a retard and start trading like an autist?
negative WSB comments only mean that this is gonna print harder
Lmfao all these retards selling off PLTR.

 Guess what I’m buying before close?! Thanks for da shares fam 😘
Wtf do I buy right now to balance out my horrible PLTR losses?
Sorry meant tendies*
Holding
increased losses yet lower revenue in 2019 vs. 2018. Annual 2019 revenue literally just 890k with nearly 9 million losses. 125% stock price increase in 2 days. Seems legit.
So no pre-pre black Friday AMZN run up, got it

PLTR is on a sale again, don't miss out!
Anyone holding BABA over the weekend?  Sell at close?
I sold 264 AYRO 11/20 5C for 0.15 each earlier this week, AMA
Thanks for the reassurance. This pandemic/year is a good time for us (wage slaves) to go in.  For any doubters or unsure Look back at the past bubbles and see how the Big boys/mm made gains after the  recovery.  
  
So what do we go in on that can:  
A. Recover the fastest?  

B. Grow the most?

Just buy PLTR calls for December
I know! 

I’m a fucking idiot bc I expected a slow grind and to get theta decayed so I sold my 262.5 11/20 and bought 12/4 and 12/11. 

Could have been up 7k instead up 3k
What year is this? 2008?
yeah i'm pretty low effort
You picked a graph that doesn't even have a fucking strong correlation idiot
Buy Xilinx over amd
For real come the fuck on
It’s ok ICLN, I have until 1/15/21 so take your time. A quarter per day will do
Bruh your title is misleading I almost bought some contracts. Good thing I read a little more.
YOLO

PLTR edged us in the morning and spent the rest of the day diving. 

Reminds me of my girlfriend rubbing her ass on my wood in the morning and then spending the rest of the day walking around the apartment with the most turn off clothes in her closet.
It's overdue for consolidation on literally every timeframe except the 5min. This is healthy and a chance to load more shares.
Buy the PLTR dip at close. Got it
Nio big dip coming?
VTRS liftoff any minute now. Annyy minute. Very soon. *checks watch*
It’s going up too fast with no news, and I see an offering coming next week
Looks like ramen tonight boys pltr is hot trash like RKT

Congrats to my fellow BABA diamond hands. Paying off big time
Same except the complete opposite.

Calls or puts?
My PLTR 11/20 -98% 🤡
Welcome to options. You want to buy options where the bid and ask are fairly tight and volume is atleast a few hundred.
Who bought tesla  at 500?

couldn't have said it better myself.
When did you buy them?  I'm expecting it to hover around 13 for the rest of the day tbh.  We had a pretty big move this week already, but impossible to really tell

Damn bought too early could’ve gotten them cheaper
Would have made 113k more had you just stayed in corsair for another 2 days.
I'm a BMW guy, I have an e36 and e46. Old BMWs get shit on a lot when they don't deserve it. Especially with an automaker like Volkswagen. I was briefly looking into an S4 and realized every time you want to do something you have to take the whole damn front end off, and the belts and coolant hoses are on the back of the engine, pretty much impossible to reach. Combined with shitty timing belts and water pumps and the car is a disaster.

Anytime I see anyone driving a Volkswagen I think it just means they wanted a German car, with no regard to how shitty they are.
For sure I'll keep holding. I'll also buy PLTR next week
They’ll never learn
because it makes literally no sense why such a small company would have this high a run, other than EVs go brrr

Monday
This will not age well
What can I buy right now guys?
Who cares how expensive they are? Even if you buy 1 contract and gain 10% on 1 contract, you gained 10% overall on your principal investment.  Percent gain is more important than cost of contract.
Also, did you consider, the higher the price of the contract the more room it has to go down as Theta decays over time.
:)

Swing trades on this are a blast, but I had to set aside a specific portion of shares/calls for those or I ended up missing big upswings
Jokes on you MM my options don't expire until next week
Thanks whoever said IPOC
getting fkn wiped by pltr rn
You would think they feel disappointment enough that they would be extra cautious to not disappoint anybody else in their lives....... guess not.
That hits way too close to home for me

Did someone mention Blackrock owns GME? 

Cause that 12.60 bounce is certainly a Blackrock bounce. Been seeing them every fukin day for 9 months straight.

Unmistakable in it’s precision.

Nio puts exp next week a good idea at close or am I retarded
Gme interesting
It's just short of five minutes before the big boys at the hedge funds finish their lunch, drink the remainder or their Café Cortados, finish eating their gourmet smashed avocado paninos and then drive this market into the fucking ground before a weekend of hookers and blow.
PLTR will finish green today calling it right here
Every dip getting bought
Boston and NYC are the biggest tech hubs on the East Coast. Northern Virginia is not even close.
ok cool so the american people can finally get some help during a pandemic if a party needs their vote

very cool
Same call but don’t have as many as you /: up 81%
I will LOL if TSLA goes to $420 again. I sold my calls when the stock hit $506, and would love to pick them up again at a cheaper price.
Bullish
Yeah. I’m pretty sure I’m retarded. I read that incorrectly
No catalyst. Just solid earnings and business foundation and extremely undervalued.

This is all current news media outlets, that I am aware of. Are you going argue differently?

Like you I also would like more positive or even just neutral news stories. Stay well buddy.
Placed a buy option order for $2.40 between the $2.35/$2.45 bid/ask. It didn't fill, so I bumped my order up to the ask at $2.45, and it insta-filled at $2.37. What is this 🤡 shit?
BABA is super undervalued, come join the tendie train. Already up close to 50% from contracts that were bought yesterday. Don't miss out
[deleted]
If you sell, don’t sell all. You’ll FOMO back in when it rallies to $300 and regret your lost tendies.
Someone give me a day trade
it's down 3% today oh no
Hard to find some potential 12 baggers
Chyna stocks Will explode these 2 weeks

Hmm, let me log in to check my stocks.... Oh wait, TD is down because it's a piece of fucking shit.
🧻🤲🤡
This is a moody assstock
Yup. Look at the chart on those calls. They were 13.00 last week and 9.40 now. I think msft could have a small pump as we rotate back into tech and sell for a hundred.
Tesla just rejected its ATH. Puts secured
Market has been treating the bulls well 🌝
FTIV is about to moooooooon🚀🚀
Anything to get this thing over $20. That’s when the real action will happen.
I sold mine a few days ago for $90 profit, today they're be worth $1080, fml
I read the short squeeze post a while ago about GME and it’s up since you last told me. I might well see. I do have a diversified safe account
Lame volume. Holiday approaching. Time to see how much fishing I can accomplish over the next nine days.
4. sell PLTR (it's a dog) buy AYRO
Exactly what he said lmao...
God I hope so lol
Bury me in voodoo chips. $UTZ to the fucking moooooon
PLTR is only crashing because it so happen to be the only call I bought in the last 4 months.
At the same time
Barcodes
Always believe in moderna bought in at 30 wish I knew how to call then
Good luck, I typically don’t hold over the weekend in case some shit news happens
[deleted]
it already did the drop today from the Citron tweet earlier. I bought a call and 29 shares at open and Im still green on both. Might be worth just holding through the weekend
Why do ppl waste money on lottery tickets when they could just buy calls?

Hold and it’ll keep growing. Great long term investment that’s bringing rapid short term gains with it. Doesn’t get much better than that.
Dude have you been in Nio for longer than like 3 days? That shit just had a wild run. We just catching our breath
12c 1/15/21 lets go
Baba doesnt give a fuk about murican problems!
It’s really as simple as buy the dip and 💎 🙌
We going back to 420?
Buying long dates apple calls. I think they'll be coming out with Project Titan News soon.
EV's are the future and no way they don't capitalize on the recent hype.. also Puts on Nio. This news will cripple them
Luv u bb
why are calls barely up when CRSR is up like 7%?
Get Jan at the min, but I'd suggest mixing jan/april.

I know the pain though, I have 3k in 15cs expiring today that I bought a month ago.  Hurts, but my long dated are covering the losses
what's the catalyst
Starting to look like DT is burning the bridge on his way out.

- slaps on bunch of restrictions on China 
- not serious about passing stimulus 
- treasury taking a more hawkish tone acting like they’ve done enough already
- no more public market pumping attempts 

LMK if you see it otherwise.
checkout BABA. Might not be that late but at your own risk
Pull your risk capital you retard and ride the gains

PTON 120 eom. Easy
Eat my ass gay bear
Papa BABA!! 💚
If get the money soon I’d call it a buy, it will dip again next week if you wanna see how it does but it will eventually be up overall throughout next month, it’s a long term hold
dear diary, today mom made pancakes instead of waffles. I specifically told her I wanted waffles, I think she hates me. I'm going to tell Dad when he gets home from his Pegging club.
Lmao 420 get lit
if u guys simply do math on crsr vs logi

crsr stonk go up
Yes. Stay away from companies with increasing revenue while almost all others post losses.
Same way im feeling with BABA and Z

People ask me what I’m on... I tell them there’s winners and losers in this life, I just got lucky.

Ireland is amazing if you can get the weather, especially the West coast.
Just get out of Dublin/Belfast asap. They're shithole tourist traps.
Imagine selling baba under $260 lol. RIP weak hands
PLTR has just seen it’s first red day this week and some of y’all act like it’s the end. It’s just the beginning🚀
Aye
webull sucks for options
If they bought in after those two days of craziness, they deserve a loss.
You call this DD?
Positions now or ban
Just crash and burn PLTR.
not looking like it fam
Imagine after an grossly overreaction/overselling of one of the biggest e-commerce companies in the world, people are still shorting lmao
Remember to buy the next CRSR dip 🚀


What? SPY is flat AF.
Puts
 Noooo
It's comments like these that make me certain there are bots on here trying to drive prices up.
Great fucking this is
because BABA is not in 🍔 land
But right  now savings rate only keeps going higher and personal debt hasn’t increased at all (compare that with 08-09). I believe not traveling is saving people $$ which is going into savings and spending on consumer items.
dw i wouldn't hold you to it lol

but yea anything under 480 i'll probably buy
Considering it's chinese, doesn't that make sense?
Let's go flipper
So, when should I sell my 11/27 calls on ZM

Today or Monday?👀
watching SPY candles today is actual torture
Man I need a play right now

Sold my PLTR 18c for 11K profit at the 4% pump this morning. Immediately switched to puts after. Up another 2K on puts. Feeling like a goddam King 🙃
It‘s good as long as it‘s positive, doesn‘t matter how much!
Yeah i usually feel pretty good about my 5 consecutive 50-100 dollar days followed by a -2k day. 😂
No fear, Palanteam! This is a totally normal pullback on moderate volume.  Healthy and expected for stock to take a breather before next leg up.
Can I get a NIO pump? Amen 🙏🏻

What stock
yep, wanted to make a quick 20% and I would have if I had entered the order about 20 minutes earlier
Sell while you can make a.profit
ban
Lockdown in SOME of America.
“Cap” like not truthful, grandpa
Just set up an options trade for some strike and it asks you if you want 0DTE
This is what peak performance looks like
Exactly.  He also didn't need to amend his 13D to include the letter, unless he is looking to protect himself from lawsuits by the short sellers.  He can say he made his intentions reasonably clear that he may force a vote
I kept spamming for you retards to get in CRSR. Set trailing stop-loss and enjoy gains. It’ll keep going up looking at Market cap vs. revenue. Q4 will be definitely positive earnings too
3 simple rules: discipline, hard work, and knowledge and you can do that too
I shouldn’t of ever doubted you. Apologies
Well typically my sister and I have an argument and my mom cries
Bruh just throw your money in GME shares or April calls. Possible takeover by Ryan Cohen soon which would squeeze the fuck out of shorts. My PT is 300-400 at its peak, literally could just be a 5 days squeeze since shorts would have to cover if shareholders vote to accept the buyout and loaned shares must be recalled. Just sit back and watch it unfold, shares are the best choice imo
[deleted]
But long calls are quite expensive. Anyhow thanks for the note, will remember that for life now
I sold my $40 calls when it was around $35, missed out on over 1k
TRUEEEE

Never trade on Emotions. I swear, lost money for no reason today except for fomo and over trading
Anyone cashing out today? Or holding?

I’ll fucking do it again
-154 on your CMI call? GARBAGE! /s
Leave it to GME to experience 5% swings several times a day lol.
Robinhood is one of the worst brokerages in the United States. I'm sure you have to have better options in the EU.
PLTR!!!🚀🚀🚀
P/S 34.21  


Am I missing something?
Lockdown in America but BABA is flying lol
Put a few hundred in it last month and then proceeded to pull out after I made a few bucks bc no fucking way it keeps going f up...   ya. I’m a dumbass
I thought pltr was as solid was crsr, once pltr started drilling I panicked. Profited off crsr at least
SPY is traaaaash today
1/15 25c. Thinking of dumping before close
[deleted]
if you are not short this market, less maybe some tech, get your head out of your ass
hold that, going back to 300
Man... PLTR is really making my daily chart ugly. I need to remember I have long dated calls and don’t need to worry. 

On the upside, those weeklies I sold will expire worthless.
I sold crsr at 38 and  held pltr i'm such a retard, even bought more PLTR when it ''dipped'' to 18,9
CRSR was PLTR before PLTR. Don’t meme a good stock.
what is the predicted timeline for this history making short squeeze? I just dont understand how if this is going to be "biggest short squeeze ever" why am i only seeing it on wsb
Always fun ngl
Must be an iPhone thing. I'm on Android.
I didn’t see these lines before- you smart, I buy more
Same
Probably right. Had me fooled without the fedora
PLTR down 6.5% from it's high. My December calls were *still* in the red when it was at 19.65. Scared to even look now.
I think ZM could see 500 again, but I don't have the balls to go in on it
Nice! Locking in those sweet sweet gain
Regret not buying those rba calls I was looking at 2 days ago
Hoping APHA stock finally holds. Solid company and decent product portfolio compared to rest of CA market IMO. Good luck!
Sold out all shares
No way
I noticed that - the top recommendation was GME :) - so many people pitching GME to him. That thread is gold - has some really good investment ideas and companies to look out for.
Man making money while playing PS5/XSX should be illegal.

Guidance has to be really good.  They are going to work harder than ever before to make that happen because of Cohen's threat.  They need to give good guidance and a full strategic review to keep him happy.

I was a little neutral/bullish on dec earnings until this week, since EPS will be ugly, but guidance would be good.  We know based on order numbers that they are likely to have massive online orders coming in (est is q4 will be 75k a day).  But after that letter I think we do see a sizeable pop on earnings.  If I were you, I'd dump a few shares and get a couple of april/july calls.  If there is a recall of shares for a vote, god only knows how high it can go.  200 bucks is worth the shot at thousands ;)
Lunch dump
earnings is 11/30
Happy birthday!
Fine by me
Surely, these meme tricycle car stocks I'm tracking are up like 100's of % in a few weeks, who's even buying this and how it the price moving so fast?
jelly
Basically I trade divergence and I use support and resistances to do that. In a strong momentum trying to find a reversal is risky, this thing has been oversold for a while and the short covering momentum as well as buyers makes it hard to find pullbacks
BABA is having a nice V-shaped recovery.
why do we even bother
Made $42 in/out AYRO shares :(. scary EV
It’s a good day in the market if I make more than $50. Anyone else? I wanna see if I’m not alone in this, I always see dudes making thousands off YOLOs but I’m okay with the consistent change I make.
Needs to break 425 levels for an upward trend
where the TSLA bulls at lolz
CLF dec.18 $10c looking real good for me rn
Your first mistake... Never, ever, buy weekly calls unless the money you're playing with is free money you can gamble with and not care to lose. Always buy long calls (month out, 3 months out). Long calls allow you time to get out when price (eventually) moves towards your direction. It lowers the option market risk tremendously.
One of the best growth companies out there, hold or roll that shit
cool. my dad's grandfather's folks are from louth and meath, i believe. can't wait to take my son out there
They actually went from being a chinese market company subsidized by the government to getting commercial funding via a US company, to shifting a ton of their focus on india. They had a few big sales there this year. I think their earnings is going to be great and the first big catalyst. The real hidden gem is their 5G products coming out...
dump tsla dump
you clearly lack context
Had weekly calls expiring today. You really think it’ll go up Monday? Could be worth loading up on some 11/27 calls
Toilet paper hands
Too vague. Looking for advice with no info. Ban
Solo volume is off the charts.
[deleted]
Can you go cash account on robinhood and trade options? Heard you can’t. I am missing out on day trades because of this.
Hold and sell Monday at open is what I would consider personally from a non bias opinion
Max pain for BABA is $270.00, we might just hang there until EOD
dump while it's still worth something dude, the drilling has only just begun
I just did it on my iPhone XS. All segments just like op.
He can’t even sell until March
This 2 weeks Will be Red my ninja.
This is the way

If this call reaches more people, then I will have done my job. Spread the wealth my fellow retard. You should seriously look into clover (if you think market cap will be under $2bn your argument is not strong - $3.7 bn enterprise value)
Just watching red candles as price falls away from magic lines would be sexxxx
Do you see it hit $20 EOY?
[removed]
I don't know what to do. I've never had this many tendies. They about to rug pull the whole market aren't they
I guess I'm the only one who is printing money off SOLO
That might be your opinion, honey, but here we know better.
Jesus fucking christ lol
Made over $100 so far and CRSR is my only stock lol
It will be, but it's a LEAP play, not a weekly or monthly play.
Down the remainder of the day or maybe a jump back to 500?
Imagine not buying baba under 260
Scalp half, secure the profit, I sold 265 next week and holding feb/jan!
Is ZM done? Or 465c 11/27 a good move
Another great day of trades, executed perfectly. If any beginners are looking for tips you can DM me for a course on how to be a successful trader day in and day out, just like this...

Damn wish I sold this morning I didn't expect this dip, can't buy anymore :l
Pltr dead
I entered a TSLA 0DTE call this morning and I shit you not it has not seen green the entire day, even when we rallied back to $501 again.
So July 2021 LEAPs then? In it
Xpeng will have a stock offering soon, nio already has.....and is worth 3x the market cap....long xpeng
Absolutely fucking not
I’d say hold man - this behemoth wants to fly.
I just bought in. I think Q3 might cause a drop, but Q4 would be good. RC would have to make a move before earnings..
Pltr 😂
riot you had one job!
[deleted]
Probable just flat code red
Pump and dump.
This ev bubble is going to pop so hard
The real answer is I’ve been burned so many times before that I can’t hold an option past 20% in the green.
Fucking nio
CRSR is an insanely good long term investment but holy shit look at how good the short term is right now. I’m gonna cum. Maybe twice.

Bought 550 12/31 calls at open today.... down 1400 at the moment congrats and fuck you

I dont think it is safe. I bought the same for 4/12/2021 295.

There’s missionary, reverse cowgirl, full nelson and my wife’s boyfriends favourite: doggy style
My April calls are still down though
SPY nooo
I have both PLTR and CRSR in my account, guess which one I have more of
Bro it’s up .3 lol
All in
check my post history, check their 20-F filing, its a play going into next year but an easy 10x on news.
Made around $100 so far when I dropped $1K yesterday morning on one stock only which is CRSR. I'm kinda happy it's going pretty well so far. Imo I think it will be $80 overall when the day ends but I'm still learning and it's nice so far. I do appreciate you guys and yes I sound like a soft ass retard but fuck it lol
Luv the flexin
I'm a palanteerist but that was fucking funny
it really is kinda lame... guess im gonna have to live with only being up 85% this month instead of 100%
Hope you autists were too scared to buy the baba dip
Oh you're mistaken. I'm definitely hoping on the play, it's brilliant. I just think you're autistic for trying to get upvotes to prove your positions lol
11/27 280c 1.29
ayyyyyy $30k in LFG
Man looking on twitter, this Great Reset stuff is starting to get into qanon level conspiracy territory.
It's unstoppable
I dont even have any positions any more, but watching bulls bUy ThE diP for daddy Jpow and never getting their beloved "v-shape" when RSI hits 30 on the 1  minute candles would make me happy
No
Up 100% on Baba should i hold till next week? or sell
Dude. You are so money, you don’t even know. But you do
People who want to work out but can’t because gyms are closed. And not one person complains about those bikes or how much they payed.
Waiting for that big dump to buy more again and let it flyyyyy
Why stop at just Xpev and Tesla then, go big dick, if EV is a rocket going to the moon Im the autist strapped to the side with no spacesuit, idgaf

Jack Ma isn't the ceo of Baba anymore Danny the dump man Zhang is.
I suddenly understand all the rocket emojis. Between BABA and ARYO I might get to fly in one.
It's only 7k. Sleep in peace
SPWR, FSLR?
Just another 100% gain that I missed out on. Good thing I blew most of my gains on 1dte spy and Tesla calls instead right
18.29 PLTR stop loss set. If it breaks 18.30 it’s going way down
Understood. But look at the real reason why you sold that. Understand that emotion that made you do that and remember it for the next time. Thats all I'm saying. Ive learned this lesson before.
CRSR is the new PLTR, boys.
No blink
Hi 🤡
$18.50, which is where the market wanted it all week.
Can ZM just go one way or the other, shit dude
i only up 30%, when u bought and what's your position?

You’re diversified with stocks. You need to do a calculated options yolo to get near a million
Why did you buy for such a close date. Gotta get leaps with these
yeah, I don't think this is comparable to the cannabis bubble at all, two completely different things. I can only see this going one way. I'll see you on the moon base
Going to be profitable

Yes but unfortunately top 25% contribute to more than 80% of our economy it is not good that bottom half is hit hard but however economy won’t be affected...

Baba 12/4 292.5c???!? Smart or no?
Shut up
I'm feeling that the recently developed ATSC3 phone could be big in India if it makes it through the current QA period and into production. It could have the first to market advantage. With data in India being dirt cheap it could help push users to replace their tvs with the new ATSC3 enabled phone.
In hindsight... I probably should have held my BABA 262.5 calls a taddd longer
What are you using to tract the movement
People that are holding or have loooooong calls are gonna be so happy. I wish I had money for long calls
Gay Bears last night: “cIrCuIt BrEaKerZzZ”

What is that, Monopoly money? 

Also.. I’m sure that baby rekts chicks in Manhattan penthouses, don’t lie...
Sure some will drop off, but I'll say it again:

Calling this a bubble is misunderstanding the consumer demand.

___

Right now the US market has how many mid-range EV options? The Leaf, the i3, maybe a couple more if that. **This is a lack of inventory, not a bubble**.

Consumer demand for EVs is super high, especially with the model 3 dropping out. The US market has no long range EV options.

If there are 5 houses for sale and 700 buyers, you don't call it a housing bubble you call it lack of inventory.
There is no “getting stuck” when it comes to selling off. If you really want to sell, you sell at whatever price someone’s offering. The volume you’re seeing on the sell side is beyond the current price, they’re expecting it to go up before they take their profits. A sell off is when people just sell at current price meaning the Value goes down. You can’t have a “sell off” with a stable price.
BABA and APPS gonna carry my portfolio on their backs
Ask me how I'm feeling today w CRSR and BABA as my largest positions
I have a tasty trade account that I set up just for warrants. Also TD Ameri has them. Robinhood doesn’t have them yet
Did you end up buying more?
17.5 -18. Its witching day
Buy duh dip
Patience here, they got ALOT of room to go
to start, those shares need to be options. This isn't r/investing
I have $20 11/27c can we please pump these numbers up
So if you let it go down 99% what’s the logic behind selling when it literally cannot go lower?
y tho?
Stop while you're ahead. Withdraw atleast 60k and do Roth IRA
At this rate I think $17 would be optimistic
averaged down for 2 weeks, I deserve this
Hmm pretty value. Thanks for the suggestion! Might pick up a couple cheers
Real talk!
If TSLA could jump 8% randomly I'd be pretty happy
Up 130% on the one share I bought for my Roth 🤑🤑
I’ve sold to lock in my profits fyi
I had blnk 11/27 12c last week, a lot of it. I get it.

Any odte ideas right now? Tesla $485p zM $450c??
I'll be buying anything under $20 I can afford. I'm waiting on the Covid response to be transferred over to Biden's team. That's when we will find out PLTR will be essential to the response and boomers start treating it like Zoom, bringing it up to the triple digits by December 2021. We threw 2 trillion at Covid this year, tax payers will cough up anything needed to stop it, including paying whatever PLTR asks. Once we do it, other countries will want it also. By 2022, PLTR will be well known by all due to Covid and other shadey contracts will follow. By 2023, the reptilians will reveal themselves.
CRSR on a mission to fucking Pluto right now

The trade right now is buy every small to mid cap EV and short TSLA as a hedge.
i just used chgg the first time on my mid term. Cost me $60 for a tutor to help me  but he did the entire midterm with all the work and sent pictures and i just rewrote it in my writing to submit for the grade
SHOP 1000c Jan up 70% from this week
Nice, how do you buy warrants? I am new to this and read about it. I don't see a SBEW ticker. Aren't warrants supposed to end with the "W"?
What are you fat fucks doing for weekly option plays for next week?
Because I lost a lot of money last month and my last hope is TDOC calls, or are you asking me to say why to invest in TDOC?

Long story short: More lockdowns = more telehealth
Calls it is
Wtf how? U bought those calls when pltr was at ath or something?
Thing is, BABA still got like at least $40 more left to run lmao
Does OP offer full refund or is there a restocking fee?
Stupid plastic money
Bought at 257 but still happy

You are poor and a retard. Look at the hedge funds and backers for PLTR. I have no positions in it but its not some scam.
Well you wouldn’t be able to get April calls, so you can throw it in January 30c. High risk very high reward
I bought them, but then paper hands set in for whatever reason. Usually that type of shit doesn’t happen to me

NVDA puts printed tho
They seem to wrap opinion as fact because doom and gloom gets clicks and eye balls rather than looking at data and have more positive news which no one cares about.
I saw this marked as futures and lost it lol
They definitely got caught up in the SPAC deflation the last few months. But their last earnings report showed big growth and high margins. Also same company that brought DKNG public. Also, esports betting is the future.

Haha, how many people are buying Telstra right now?
the actual squeeze will happen when Ryan calls for a buyout offer.  The shares will all be recalled and the shorts will have to cover. It'll blow up.  Otherwise earnings in 3 weeks might cause some upward movement.

corsair is fucking flying
Watching baba going crazy when I sold my calls worth 6k yesterday and bought Amazon
No sympathy for those with calls expiring this week or even next week. Weeklies just draining peoples accounts when they could buy a couple months out. Maybe we would get less “how fucked am I post”

They are a commercial charging solution. The issue with their business model is that they can get completely wiped out if the EV makers choose to follow the TSLA model and provide their own charging systems that can be installed in the homes of their customers. If your EV can run hundreds of miles on a single charge and they can be charged in your garage, only a fraction of EV owners will elect to use a BLNK or SBE system. 

I invest in SBE too because I wanna profit on this bubble and then get out

I should have said Wall Street scam. It’s a business. But not a successful one.
Shut up
Stairs on the way down, elevator on the way up. Just fucking dump already
According to a Dutch study masks are statistically insignificant for stopping the spread and in some cases increase the spread. Study was released this past tuesday. Masks only give you mental peace of mind.
Can we start pumping PLTR again?
Would agree but buying now is still bottom and not top like other instances you describe above
Buy high, sell low most likely
Abort! TSLA channel broken
Exactly, rockets run out of fuel here and there
Is XPEV at the top? I need to hedge some of these losses

I bought 12/18 30 calls. I always loose  money in this stuff bu I keep doing it.
Why is it going up?
Hmmm baba showing price action doesn’t matter at all during momentum
😎
My xpev calls are ITM over night. LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Is it Nio’s turn
You think it will stay going up ?
Jesus
Not on the resale market. Costco ran out of TP in my area this week.
Trailing stop losses or buy puts against your positions
Haven’t even started short covering on baba
When a share is shorted, it is sold but and the stock takes a hit from the sale, in order for that position to be closed, the opener has to buy the share back, which is called a cover, and raises the price.

GME has 130-150% of its float (shares that aren't "locked") shorted.  In the event that a board vote is required, the institutions that own the shares that are lent out for shorting, would recall all their shares in order to participate in the vote.  That means that the brokers would close out the short's positions for them at the best possible price.  So you have 70 million shares in a market order position, with not enough shares to buy to cover, so the price rockets up.

Volkswagen is the easiest case to review - their stock ran from 200 to 1k in a few days on this...with 30% of float shorted, vs 130% on GME.

The price of GME wouldn't stay at that high price for very long - could be a day, could be a week.

&#x200B;

The other option is a slow squeeze in the event of no share call back.  Tesla is a prime example of that.  It had 30% of the float shorted and ran up in price as people got margin calls (if a stock you shorted rises enough after shorting it, the broker makes you pay up to keep the short active, or closes it for you) and had to buy shares to cover, which pushed the price up and caused even more people to get margin calls in a vicious circle
It ain’t done yet
Where are you getting 30 EOM from
I'm using it as a short term trade. I have long term positions too but for short term, I don't have infinite capital so I treat it like swing trading options (which most do here).

You know it can be both simultaneously right? For some reason people forget this. If you are saying that CNN and some other networks post repetitive articles / content, I would agree there.

No idea. I'm expecting a sell off at $25 going into next week. But if it stays flat for a bit its a good buy to get in for next year.
Let’s hope it works retard
No rally to close?
I mean, it sucks, but not much we can do about it, except try and make some fucking money.
haven't traded an ev stock yet that's lost money... idk why I haven't bought in yet
PTLR looking for 1h and 4h higher lows, next leg up coming soon ! Time to hop on ! 30$ eom!
I did but I sold them at 263. Bought back in at 264

Just sold my eyeballs, don’t need eyes to see that this stock is going to the moon.

I believe you were right
I sold these puts short brodie, bullish move. Considering hopping on a few calls
How low? 490? 500? Long puts?
FCEL, SPI, BLNK. I’m currently looking right now too, but look at what those three have done so far
We all have our turn. And together we are stronger

Yes. He hates that stocks are going up and wants them to go down. He is mad that other people are making money. He is still upset that the “second wave” hasn’t crashed the market yet. He has no idea what risk free yields are in comparison to earnings yields. He is probably all cash so he can “buy back in cheaper once we crash”.

Good BABA
I don’t even know how did they get such crazy growth on profit margins by doing cost management alone within one year, they either are better at this than Tesla China or something is fishy. Idk
Do you have any thoughts around the market response to FEAC since they announced Skillz merger? It was up to $14, down to $11.50, up to $14, down to $11.50, up to $14.. but watching this closely it hasn't felt volatile, rather it has this base underlying demand and just continues to hold steady and dips get bought up. I know nothing of technical analysis, this is just more gut feel watching this on the daily

Would be nice to know what I'm looking at
Raise your hands if you were a true OG who bought BABA calls when it was 255✋🏼
They probably bought at the high last friday

Well, I’m officially back to my October highs. Still down $3500 overall, but that’s up from being down $5500 at Nov 2nd
Icic. Hmm puts you reckon?
Holy shit we've never heard this joke before. It's become the "it has it's ups and downs" of elevator jokes.
enjoy the loss porn
Imagine if you put more than 3 grand in.
How much premium you get off your calls?
When does today's market open? Goddamn sideways action putting me to sleep.
marriage + children
Wow that's a diamond hand play, you should know when you enter
Being a simp for upvotes....fucking really? Go die.
That's just way too far out of the money. If you want leverage over shares, but less risk than close dated options buy LEAPS ATM, or a bit OTM.
Howmuch was the lowest point?
XPEV gonna fly again
No I’m being serious.
About to go all cash for the weekend.
I pulled out this morning to ride CRSR but I’ve sold and am all-in PLTR again. She’s my true love.
*Press X to Doubt*
Lol. Companies don't need to actually make a profit anymore. Fundamentals flew out the window two years ago
Imagine thinking the market is efficient
Won’t see sub 270 after today BABA
Been buying the KNDI dip. Yes the offering is shitty but the market cap is so crazy low
I had a dec 18 17.5 call I sold a week ago for 85$
Bought $15k worth of BABA 7/16/21 $300c this week fully expecting that to be a 10 bagger hnnng 💦
my portfolio is not retarded enough so I've bought solo for that extra tard spice
This market has to collapse soon right?

It’s literally just fueling retards

Right guy? Right?!?!?!?
The battle between lockdowns vs vaccine news
[deleted]
My broker is down and PLTR tanking RIP
I think the only possibilities are bad vs irrelevant
Is TSLA gonna squeeze later or are we done?
YOU DID IT!!!! WP
Why
Tickers?
Down $1500 past two days. Up $1500 today. BABA calls, Dow puts, reit calls -> the perfect play
PLTR gang just preparing for afternoon moon mission
Told you.
I'd rather join yours tbh
If PLTR pulls a RKT I have no one to blame but myself
Yeah and he got in late lol.
hey don’t be rude to they’re atrocity of a solo vehicle, but you never know it may work a lot better than it looks
I see a lot of you advanced traders with Robinhood Red unlocked and I’m just curious about when I can expect mine to change from hulk dick green? Off-putting tbh.
Definitely , gunna be at ath by new yesrs
Why did I buy 20 weekly calls for CCL? Am i fucked?
This REML shit is cash money. I have no idea what an ETN is but I'm making bank.
You're not just saying that cause you haven't built up your own position yet, are you?

Imagine

Imagining

Vagina 

Really makes you imagine the truth bruh
I've read news stories but haven't seen anything from the companies' press releases on production yet. They are striking deals with airfreight companies so transportation looks good.
What’s the day high for Pton 111 calls 0tde??? Please help me WSB fucking broker is down
They were down 6k and I averaged down this week so the bags aren’t truly recovered but I’m back to breaking even on my BABA plays.
For your sake I hope it happens, doesn’t really affect me either way
From your mouth to God’s ears 🙏🏻
Even effing piece of crap NKLA is pumping
Friday is the day people take profits. It still pumped 15% this week.

Hope we end the day green.
can’t wait for next market open..
yes
What the hell is plrt
Missed out on the BLNK mooning, gonna invest more in SBE before it moons again. EV charging is the next rotation sector
I feel bad for that guy who went all in with 70k on BABA Feb 21 290c and closed it on Tuesday after losing 20k.
Same. I like this ride
What am I supposed to do with this
I really cant comprehend how a stock like NIO can be up 20% this week  and yet people are still managing to lose money on it
BABA should be a $500
Stock.  Will it? Who knows?
If you’re not loadin up the boat on GAXY you ain’t black
RIP to whoever bought these 12/18 CRSR 35p from me the other day, nothing makes me feel better than watching short options expire worthless
It should be 350+
Yes, and sucked JingPing's penis.
Why’d no one tell me about BLNK wtf
I just learned about face time. Honestly buy calls on Apple this is next wave of the future for virtual butt stuff (:

$TLS = Transport Layer Security????? They must mean business 

you son of a bitch, I'm in
Wuz dat
I was looking for a stupid play so I bought into that  

PS: I am selling the new tesla 20/11 C for just .5 😂 don't forget to pick up a few
It ain't back til its 350
Especially considering all week WSB has been quiet on this run up and buying TSLA/NIO while this thing has been rocketing.
Not really, it’s still riskier to dump in more money. You just sound salty cuz you’re broke :/
Tesla to 800 bro? Are you confident?
Oh fuck yes dailies on Robinhood
To the moon. If you cashed out just buy any dip you can get ahold of. I’ll be holding long term but damn these short term gains are unfuckingreal. Hoping for $45 EOD.
If I’m not mistaken, I think they have recently allocated 27mil for the development of 30 EVs by 2025. They had an investor call yesterday after market close- with their truck in the background. Stock hasn’t moved much today though
Yea, I just don't want to be locked into holding for a whole 2 days haha.


This is me doing this so I don't check my account everyday and can't paper hands
They are behind.
I have 10 - 7c 01/15, 7c 03/19 & 10c 03/10. I think it will be around 12 in 03/21
I love seeing 🌈🐻 bleed. Well done.
$IEP 📈📈📈
Wait till you have nth left... can i deposit my broken slippers?  🥺😔
All these autist brains struggling to accept yoloing $1M on a highly volatile company and making more than their yearly wage in two days.
BABA calls secured, to the moon
A $2 SPY drop and I'll promise to never be a dirty bear ever again.
RIP to calls and put holders of AAPL. They haven’t been doing shit lately.
It goes from $30 to $60 and back again at least three times a week ...  


= volatility = risk = expensive options
Indeed
Tendie town*
Waiting till it goes to my Robinhood account but $300 on PLTR later today a good idea?

This is the energy I need
I never doubted you BABA.  back to 300 we go!
AMD calls before Xmas get em before the YOLO degens
What about monday?

YES
I just saw sqqq and qqq both green for few secs how is it possible?
Hitting $300 next week baba
Will AMZN see maybe a little pump for thanksgiving week? Sad to see this stone cold rocket
yes, buy the top
They’re pinning it cuz lots of people bought 11/20 17.5C and 20C. Thankfully I’m in for shares at a 10.55 avg. Holding long cause I think the potential is huge.
Fuck this garbage opex action
do me a favor.. dump some TSLA real quick :)
Thanks! Will do.
Its going to be $18 eod 10000%

Baba yugeee reversal impending. Calls on supreme leader Jack Ma
Cool! Glad to see another VU fan :) 

One of my teachers introduced me to the VU’s first album earlier this year and I absolutely love it. It sounds like nothing I’ve ever heard before (which is also what he thought upon hearing it for the first time.)
What’s going on with TSLA, $510 by end of day would be ideal
I just want them to print damnit. Everything but these two have pumped insanely this week
It's NA bruh.
[removed]
BABA should be around 285 to be honest
Yeah same baby
Lmao you bout to make a killing bud.  The new lockdowns gonna fuck ridesharing again.
I mean... you knew well that this is a big gamble..
What in duh fuk

srsly, if it got up there... my 0dte calls would print rofl
Heels wit' wheelz. I'm in, when do we IPO? I need money to dump into other EV companies.
Fuck this market
GET INTO THE GREEN ENERGY SECTOR NOW
Should I still get in on baba. Boys give me a call to bid in on. I got $200 buying power
If so, that was fast af
I don’t know why the fuck I jumped into Tesla today. Even going in at the bottom is losing me money lol
Extension on cruise cancellation announced...
I got 2 months for the weed convo to spark up again before my calls expire.
So what happens when BLNK goes past all the options you can buy? Can only buy OTM calls once Monday is here?
eh dont know about that, some dude already a millionaire off of it?

$20C 3/19 checking in
Everything I paperhand and take losses on fucking moon right after. Everything I diamond hand expire worthless. I'm terrible at this game
Gyna saying F U mango man. BABA 🚀🚀🚀
I'm not sure why you're insulting me. But math shouldn't add up "pretty well," it should be exact. You never double-check what your broker tells you or highly suspicious posts on WSB?
PLTR will be 19 dollar EOD and 20 by Monday. Relax
*Xi, X-i, not his wife*
Looks like a kangaroo chart
That shit giving back from yesterday and premarket like a real skank
Catching the knife all the way down today on NIO 🤡☠️
14 contracts of 490 TSLA calls, bought on monday. Fuck the gay bears.
Hype will probably pass at some time. I wonder how long it will last.
Congrats and fuck you
my portfolio went above and below open 14 times
Fantastic company and insanely undervalued compared to competitors with inferior products.
Cus we had weeklies lmfao
2:30 trump talk good or bad for spy?
Bro I sold my 12/18 25c waaay too early. $40 could have been $1000.
Haha now I’m green!
You’re fucking right my man
[deleted]
Guys any potential news gonna be coming out this weekend?
Thing is, BLNK and SBE provides the charging solutions for the EV cars. They are pretty important for the coming years.
PLTR speculators keep making me richer, I’ll keep selling you guys these garbage calls
damn they were never bags if youve already recovered
I bought puts at the low 😭😭😭
Oh no bro sell sell sell 115 is STRONG resistance. Roll to 110
% gains should be celebrated. This is stocks Aswell it’s a safe bet. What the fuck has happened to this sub
EV stocks make me horny. Literally the dotcom bubble all over again except in lightspeed mode. I'm currently holding AYRO that I bought 5 mins ago with full intent to sell monday morning when the hype gets investors all horny.
Of course people are buying why tf even make the post with such an obvious answer. But on red if you are long on the company.
What is a share. I WANT TO KNOW
So is Nio gonna release the news or what?

Has... Has... NIO... also become a boomer stock? :-(
Nah not during covid. I am not going to do that. I did receive a full refund and a 5 credit, but I think I’ll just pick up stuff myself from now on. Kind of concerning that ppl might mess around with my food based on what they think of their tip. Thank you for the info, it is very helpful!
Increased my baba position 3x this week. It was hitting 320 pre election and will go back once Chinese people stop being communists
dat IV  is insane.
Where’s it going? Cashed out on a 40c weekly today, felt good
It feels good to have made it all back, now I just got to do it again and again
It'll likely go to 271 before pulling back.
u think its going down?
Jack ma has bent the knee !!?
But we don’t speak European.
Lol you are fucked
Tesla 480 EOD 🐻🔻
Autistic mentality, I love it. I think the same way.
Good luck in your oil-related investments. I personally don’t see the growth opportunities there (and I also don’t want to buy into the industry) but we all make our own investment decisions, and that keeps things interesting!
PLTR has one red day and everyone's in panic lol
Tech is in a bubble and anyone denying it is a retard.

If you like money stay away from any stocks associated with “data” “could computing” “work from home” “EV” “the future” “growth”.
Math
Y’all get in on these BLNK calls? Brrrrrrrrr
MSFT flat as fuck for two hours. Is it pinned? Do things actually get pinned?
This.
Ahah okok, i have mine since monday
True he forgot to say buy NIO and PLTR options
What is shares?!? Only know contracts. Please advise.

BLNK is up 32%. THIRTY TWO FUCKING PERECENT!
All hail to Jack Ma!!!! Baba is back bitchez!!!
Buy the dip.... Be the dip...
What are we holding over the weekend?
You lost on TSLA lul
YOLO material
 Congratulations! Did you sold or still holding?
NCLH puts are printing
Bought 400 more shares at 18.32, pltr to the moon
have they been crushed recently? id pick some up
Gay
why are NIO options so expensive?
Mmm not sure, probably hover around the price it’s at, just look at the articles about it from the last couple days and you’ll see why it would be a good long term hold
killing the 20c it was planned
Fridays are usually low because of the weekend. Watch on Monday.
What day exactly options come out? November 23rd?

Gonna well at $30 next week
That is definitely not a healthy graph
If you’re not buying this PLTR dip, you hate money more than Tim Apple
How do I turn the color to green ?
Imagine not imagining things
lol I bought the 19c ITM for next week, went up 40% and now I'm down 35%
SOLO might still get some swings, but it’s way above where it should be
this cute little fucker.
If he held, he's up big
eh fuck it wiping your ass was so 2020

I just bought some. Hop in innnmnm!

Las Vegas
Pre-merger. Clover health is eventual Acquisition, backed by Google and Sequoia.
8k on fsly today, selling now. Done for the week. Have a good weekend.
The only people freaking out are the weeklies and shorts
When will palantir hit 20 fuck
Made 1k on nio this morning! 0dte made me sweat

almost too good to be true
Ameripoors made pltr bleed yall fuckers
Anyone looking at GE calls?
Interesting! Haven’t paid much attention to that one. Is GM big when it comes to EV?
Baba finally catching a bid
Up 500 dollars on SOLO puts this morning Lmaoo
why?
Wouldn't surprise me at all. I'm holding a fair amount of good positions (for my present level of account) so I'll be holding until I'm up well into the green.
Anywhere near 510 today and I'm out though.
wtf happening to pltr?
Why
well I just bought that exact contract so...
PLTR and RKT gang haz sad?
Was hold PTON 110/115c debit spreads expiring today for weeks. Sold yesterday at -80% thinking no way its coming back based on behaviour for a week. Today they are 250%. RIP.
I could not feel more confident about an afternoon dump. Who would want to hold over the weekend?
NIO get your ass up there with XPEV plz.....
It has barely moved all day. It’s going nowhere in a hurry
Today, both
Lol especially after LK . Me too man.
Fuck solo
would i be retarded if i bought crsr right now
Fsr? Hell yeah I rode that wave when it was $13. Really surprised how they didn’t hit $20 the passed few days, looks like they’ve been stuck at &16 ish for a while
It didnt.

It's 1/3rd of Nio
Profit’s profit blah blah blah 150% profit is great but......

If I held BLNK, I’d be up 300% rn. FUCK.

That’s a fucking L and y’all know it.
June 18th 21 MSFT 235 calls, look juicy.
[deleted]
Wouldn’t really consider today a dip for Tesla, but if you’re buying shares and planning on holding for awhile then yes buy shares
Roblox waiting room

What’s a good short term play until the IPO, I’ve just been wheeling AMD and RKT for baby gains but it’s been alright
That’s the greatest bull case for BABA imho
diamond handers give me your power
Jack ma sucking off Xi confirmed???
My TSLA 500c, that I DID NOT BUY for 0.98 and went to over 12.0, knows exactly that feeling to which you are referring. 

Kudos
Well played, well played
no im actually out till wednesday 😒 im staying out lol
BLNK and SBE
Anyone think Z can keep running into close ? Just bought hella 115 lottos
Started from the bottom now I'm here.

Started from the bottom now my whole port runnin'
Later hopefully 25 by April March
Buying this PLTR dip
You didn't buy calls for tsla like you said you would? You followed my advice to buy PUTS or not buy at all?.... Right?......... Right?
Cathie Wood sold off some shares near the bottom. Her haters want to make her look bad so they're pushing it up.

Note: I made that up.
Sold 500 shares at 12.5
It is definitely back. I bought first my first call for April 2021, at 295 strike price for BABA. Given that there will be two earnings report it should definitely reach that price once either in December, given increased lockdowns or after the IPO is cleared.
This is **not** the way, dude
Dumb
Soros is zapping down PLTR with his Palpatine powahs
Baba is just getting started boys 300 eow next week

My BABA bags recovered and still have room to run
Where them tendies at fam? Ima sign up
All good!
How tf did XPEV overtake NIO so quick, I object. We need NIO to RUN
You hate money if you don’t have CRSR. It’s just getting started.
I’m sorry. If you have anything left in your account that you don’t give a shit about, put it in GME calls that expire either in January or April
Your staff is broken!
It was probably just way oversold
[deleted]
14.5 avg, 2021 expiration. I’m cooling 😎
Looking for a straight cubby man to twerk his ass cheeks for me

BABA TO THE FUCKING MOON. 
KEEP GOING BABY.  🚀🚀🚀🚀
🪦 🐻
Great use of that vid
Sorry for killing baba boys, I just bought calls at the top
This is the way
That’s Merrill edge buddy
Hope you’re selling this pump
It was wayyy oversold. Gap above price, it’ll get to 280 in a week
Selling options is such a trip on Fridays, watched my open 270 BABA calls go from .20 to 1.20 to .50 all in like 5 minutes

THERES NO BRAKES FOR BLNK!!!
Sold my 11/20 265c this morning 🤣 but I rolled up to 12/4 285 I feels man

You're buying puts on all of the wrong EVs dumb fuck. Except solo. You should be shorting solo, kndi, and fuv.

I like this guy, take my upvote

I'm up to my tits in all of them.
Yeah same. What a wild ride it has been today.
Can't believe BLNK is still going full retard lmao.  Missed out on a lot selling at 22 but whatever congrats all diamond handers.
WHO says it doesn't work yet Trump was healed by this medicine. Who are you going to believe?
Wait for BABA dip or get in right now?
I feel like no serious traders thought it would have an up day
What broker do you use?
ATM TSLA calls
How much you lost?
He should’ve held. CRSR is just getting started.
FYI: We are all sociopaths with no emotions.
Same, I almost closed at a loss earlier this week but decided to double down. If this continues to Monday I'm in tendie town
Is that what you’re selling? Alright I bought in. If it doesn’t pay I’ll bookmark this to ask for refund 😁🤣
PLTR gonna slowly die now
PLTR flushing the day traders before next run up.
I'm not selling my baba calls expiring next week, I'll enjoy my gain for the weekend and cry monday when it dumps.

First ones free
They were oversold on that ant group news

Pls
Yes
I like your crazy words magic man
extra stem cells gives ya more t cells and blood cells for a few months i suppose
Same
Up 15% on PTON $150c 9/17
This short term recovery could slap
Na man.. Just letting you know there's still time to get in.. Back to 120 easy by year end.. Bottom line: you are trading for $$ not cause you think it's a cycle with an iPad so doesn't deserve to be up there. Their numbers don't lie
Interesting! Think NIO looks good. Gonna do some research on CIIC. Do you think CIIC will continue up next week?
See you next week
So where do you see the ceiling for xpev guys?
No I like EV I’m deep in $FSR I’m just not much of a day trader. Respect to anyone who got gains with those companies though it’s just a little risky for me. Seems like they’ll dump when volume dries up. We will see tho. Next week will help us tell.
BLNK and you'll miss it!!!
TGT calls make my nipples hard
You jynxed my money machine!
BOUGHT AT THE TOP AND SOLD AT THE BOTTOM HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[deleted]
Yeah, also take a look at shitty SOLO. That's how you know this is a bubble.
ZNGA has been pretty kind to me, don’t know it’ll keep rising but 11/20s printed pretty well for small time stuff
Are they profitable?
Just ride out the dip for PLTR, it’ll print long term
Calls on the kidney. Gonna need it someday.
Missed so many gains this year on stocks I had on my radar

Wish I just didn’t watch market at all cause it hurts knowing how much I could have made
Shares?
FOLLOW THE SMART MONEY
Wow when are you starting your email stock market club?
fuck em
It has. Don't tell him...
I am not selling my shares
Been holding BABA 260C for over a week. Got in at 257...I'm gonna nut so hard if this rips next week.
Pltr goes up a lot and goes down a bit. It’s been doing this for a while now. Paper hands are gonna lose in the end.
Godspeed retard
Made 500 bucks today day trading shit ev stocks based on hype. Bought SOLO on open for under 10 and sold for nearly 13. 

Day trading in EV stocks is EZ. Buy early sell mid day.
Cause he’s right “half of the time”
What’s he pushing today? Sonos again?
What are the hot meme stocks now??
Never thought I’d be holding this many Chinese positions lmao
Almost spat out my coffee just now haha
When it becomes ARVL lol
I wonder how many people are panic selling PLTR today
VIXX Election week was by far my worst.
BLNK TENDIES BOYS
This entire week has been like half volume
Lesson learned? Doubt. I have hands made of papyrus my brother.
Nope, it's going to 280 by next week
this is peak peak
[deleted]
And? Do you just buy any stock that happens to be going up? Do you have unlimited day trades?
Got a 12/11 debit spread we'll see how it goes
Never wrong to take profits, I see it running more, I got a 500c 11/27 at the very top lol
Great, can we go uppy now
I just went in at 100x 6p 12/18 and 30x 14p 12/18.

Black Friday sale
Bought like 1 hour before this pump. Shoulda yolod more.
Fuck you we back in the green
CAD is fake currency. This is a deep fake image.
Ya know that feeling when you look at a stock, and go through buying it, just to pussy out before you confirm your order? 

So glad I don't have that feeling with baba
Can I just buy shares of Elon Musk?
5% 😂

yo lemma hit that
Hey u still have 103k to lose don't give up yet!
Take a break. Work, save, research and get back in when you’re more comfortable. Don’t fomo/yolo. Follow along on the sidelines for a bit.
TSL > PLTR GET IN HERE BOYS
I'd bet 100% that it closes EOD today.
Solid gains on BABA today.  Jack Ma > Bezos
Still down like 15% on my baba 265C 1/15/21 😭 I always try to catch a knife
PLTR big oof
Seriously what the fuck
Thank you BABA bros for convincing me to get in this morning
[removed]
I caught that knife @ 152. Sold many 150p. Feels so good.
imagine being a brokerage and not informing your customers of scheduled direct investing maintenance
This is actually a bearishness a sign
Boys I need an EOD day trade win please. I’ve got plenty of buying power give me a present please
Yes
This is just not true.

The main thing to note is today is OPEX
That’s why u have to play it right 

No calls at tops or puts at bottoms and get enuff time on them shits 

Gg
290 by EOM would be clutch.
Short squeeze on baba woopppp
Don’t go all in, this isn’t a millionaire maker.
[deleted]
[deleted]
stock too high imo
jon najarian has no fucking clue, he just pumps and dumps, not sure why he is on half-time
Fucking got 'em
Yeah, I mean today, It went from +7,5% to +1,5% and now is +4%
Damn bought BABA calls today.. why do I always yolo on the wrong stocks.. shoulda put more in.
When you see BLNK mooning and SBE bleeding down you start to get the feeling that the EV price action is based on absolutly nothing at all.
Sudden big swing for NKLA.
Let’s go I got half my portfolio in BABA calls
[removed]
BABA 270 LETS GO
Trying so hard to fill that gap up from February
No. It's called a dip, and you should've bought more.
Ascending wedge is a 🌈🐻trend you autist. Wait for the dip below into a bull flag for tendies.
Oh lord baby Jesus, first time I did an autistic YOLO play.

Had 50 0DTE $270 BABA calls average price bought at $.19 and sold for $.90

LORD MA I THANK U
Do you like to trade EV? Or not your thing
so what the hell is pumping BABA? Nothing obvious on google
baba! 0dte calls made my day
Never had that one
I wish it stayed at nearly $20 this morning and kept going.
Theta decay fucking my TSLA puts which I got a 506 and they are still not green.. life sigh
FANG touching session lows again cmon bb 🐍🐍🐍
its going up😒
Yes
$360+ territory next week since everyone's a pussy apparently
Wtf PLTR
[deleted]
That’s my boy BABA
🙏
BABA papa to 280$ by Tuesday
Lots of people on this sub love putting dark russets in their mouth.
Dad???? Are you finished buying milk
kept buying workday dip and keep getting fucked lol, i have 75k in stock down 1k but im not worried...
Tell that to those that bough Nio on Friday last week.
Positions or ban retard don't be a bitch
It’s up from wed
[deleted]
Fuck is it too late to jump into BABA?
Patience. Those are both actual winners going forward in the EV space. Lots of small caps being pumped.. don’t fomo.
[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-55013064](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-55013064)
Hi guys, ripping as I said. Your welcome
watch it tank now
I agree haha. No problem for the Leap that I have, but was gambling on a few 0dte as well. I guess that's what I guess LOL
See with those you need a movement in your direction. If the market stays flat ur fucked. Credit spreads score when market goes the direction you want, when it stays flat, and even goes down a bit (in my case $30)
I sold mine and bought a BLNK call, best move ever
Yo what the fuck happened to BABA?
$18
Congrats man...hard work pays off
Please sir can I have a stimmy plump plz
Name checks out
Daily reminder to you tards that Friday always see draws because people don't want to hold over the weekend
Why?
Sometimes minimizing loss is better than losing it all
Hold. It’s forming a bullish pattern
BABA LETS GOOOOOOO
12/4 Tesla $595 call lets get it
I thought it was me. Maybe both? I called the absolute top.
Kramer pumped it????
absolutely.
Congrats
Why would you sell yesterday when it was gaining momentum? Take note if why you did this and remember for the next time. Lesson learned
What’s been your worst investment ? Mine was bigC Jesus Christ what a pos
Can someone explain what’s happening with PLTR
Is it a spread? Watch out for iv crush if not
Congrats to the $BABA call holders
Time to get some BABA calls
Possible pull back around 271 for BABA.
Yeah I really hope people are grabbing some profits at least. Bubbles can go on much longer than seems reasonable, but this shit could explode anytime
Holy Baba it’s parabolic
Well, basically people expected their business to be much harder hit, and then they released their preliminary 2020 results, showing that they were actually doing a good bit better than expected. Margins were at the upper end of what was expected, no big catastrophic write offs like the $1 billion in July, everyone's happy.

https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/recovery-plan-paying-off-at-micro-focus-nx0gb6zk6
BABA going parabolic!!
B\_\_\_ flag
Okay once the money comes into Robinhood, possibly today since it wasn't instant transfer, I'll put a couple hundreds on it
SQ, TDOC and Roku killing it
The man put $1M his n the line, it’s a little bit of a different story in terms of risk.
BABA March calls were down $2.8k a couple of days ago. Now only down $600, good comeback! Now give me a 10 bagger on my calls BABA 🤑🤑🤑
[deleted]
Bets on SPY closing? 
I think we test the futures low of 354 then end a bit above 355
Present
JMIA showing retarded strength. Hope you fuckers bought the dip
[deleted]
Might switch it up and pray to baba tonight
I think maybe $0, before delisted
It took Tesla 16 years to be profitable. Nio will get there way faster. Nio isn’t a scam. Nio will be bigger in China than Tesla
:) big money as soon as the news catches this $25m market cap gem. Wait until they get an EV partnership to supply smart car OS's
downvoted
Already dropped 3% lmao
Can confirm, I’m in the same grade.
They're killing my boy VIX!

Next week we will see a big trend one way  (Today is OPEX, gamma rolling off)
If you complain to DD, they can fire the driver. You should do that.
Seeing stuff like this gives me hope
Got March 7.5 calls yesterday. What’s the move? Where’s this thing going
Honestly NIO should be higher than xpeng because they are worth more. Xpeng just stole the hype this week
Bought the PLTR dip
Change your name to wsb-poopy-pants
live virus update on vacs. BBC
Can this shit just dump hard so I can pick up absurd weeklies at 0.01 pls.
No lol
Buy BLNK, way better
Tell your dad to press buy for zoom
So glad I didn’t buy pltr at the top lol
Xpev🤡
Maybe if you bought around the peak today
I got 200 shares of BABA at average cost basis of 262 over the last 1.5 weeks (it dipped to -1.5k at one point when BABA hit 255). Gonna sell now for a 1.5k gain and probably use it for some other names like NVDA.
It is if you're make $10's of dollars a day!
Tesla is the only pure ev that will be around in ten years.  Other traditional car manufacturers will eat up the rest of the market.
He’s all in PTON now
i will pray with u
I have a Dec 18 $15c I hope it prints but probably not
Picked up BABA PTON and ZM at open, holding until covid gets better (could be awhile lol)
[deleted]
I'm down 80.5% over the last month.... would the Robin hood free stock help
everything #shambles except CCL of course.  FML
I guess we shall see
SHOW OR VANISH FOREVER.
Now only down $600 ;)
Sold my baba calls yesterday. I’m gonna throw up.
SPY 1/15 $110 puts
I like your heart monitor drawing
I comment saying GME gonna rip again, get downvoted, then it jumps 30 cents. Nice.

today is BABA > TSLA
Went nearly all in on baba, expect the worst
That doesn’t mean it’s a profitable company
Should I sell my ZM call expiring 11/27 now, or next Monday🤔🤔🤔

It’s a yolo btw, the call is up 100% it’s a 417.50c 11/27 now worth 3k or something but I think ZM 500 is possible
Not what happened Wednesday
i wish RH had warrants, otherwise I'd go into commons on this bitch with my entire portfolio. Oh well, calls it is..
Extreme hot potato
Please Peter Thiel, start tweeting
PLTR 11/20 19c is like $7

I bought 10 cuz fukit
The only sad part about selling puts on something like BABA is going short gamma when the run finally starts :(
One of these days GE. One of these DAYS!!!
🤣. True enough. But covered puts are an underrated play IMHO even though people love buying puts.
Don’t do that pton
Pltr support where
Feels like spy will be choppy all day then shoot up Monday then go back to being choppy all week
It feels good.
Wtf is KXIN? Somebody answer me
Imagine not buying the dip on the most undervalued large cap in the game. 

Baba calls printing. China number Wan.
Just go to 353 and get it over with ffs
Just buy lithium miners if you think it's gonna stick around
Bear flag dick heads
Somebody figured out MERC is a wood products manufacturer whose factories run on their own bacteria farts
Two words: Bit Coin 😈

Cohen been making lots of noise lately
Super Weenie Hut Jr.?!?!
Think he sold and bought PTON
When the fuk CIIC gonna launch 🚀 🚀 🚀
Buy BABA you retards, it's confirmed, Jack MA is still breathing. He is just missing an arm, a leg and one kidney. He's also been spotted with a leash around his neck with Jingping seen walking him.
that would be dope
so glad i sold my PLTR calls yesterday
BABA going so vertical it's gonna start leaning left
Let’s go!

+ SOLO 🚀🚀🚀
[deleted]
blink 182 fuck yeah
Get shit on Vamshidhar
It is an odd one. Up almost 40% on the day but doesn't even register to show up on RH top movers chart. Undercover tendies.
PLTR  20$ EOD
Last chance to get in on BABA
[removed]
Sold my baba at open fuk
Pretty happy with PLTR right now. This dip is making my CC’s print, and I can grab more shares on the pullback.
Lord my blnk 1/21 $30c is going nuts
I would just like to give a shout out to Baba, Snap, Run and NET for saving my garbage AMD and FB calls. Much love
I’m gonna all in to this wish me luck guys

So happy I sold this shit for like $100 in gains. 

I like pretzels as much as the next retard. They are tasty. But it was way too low volume for me to hold long term.

pltr im not mad im dissapointed

Y’all idiots are really the kings of “speaking to soon”
You hope
PLTR always take lunch break and shakes people out for the pump in afternoon. Prob 19.6 EOD
That millionaire dude is making a killing on CRSR if he didn’t sell.  I wonder if he bought his wife’s boyfriend any chicken tenders yet
Finally
Really wish I was part of BLNK. I know if I FOMO in now that I'll be fucked though. Up like 150% or something in a week, fucking absurd
rolling nuts rn
algos about to rip spy to the moon me thinks
Have PLTR stop loss in place not going to watch this gay market today. Will buy back if it hits
Awww yiiis bad Covid guidance in Canada - please sell off so I can buy you bb
Baba black sheep 🤩
SQ should do a stock split.

Stagmented? That’s not even a word. Even autistic people can spell.
I come across this word on occasion: stonks!
If you downvoted, then you’re right
Bullish for GM although their movement has been stagnant this past week. Hoping it will follow in the path of TSLA and NIO soon
Okay, I'm in for 100 @ 19.85
Bought the fuckin PLTR dip again. Its made me to much money. That bitch going to 30 by eoy. 

Paper handed pussies
Riding the SOLO train to gainzville !
TIL despite the name, the Proud Boys aren't a support group for 🌈 teens.
And there's the SOLO dunno
Just put the kids' college fund all in on this. If this pays off, I'll be able to send them to community college!
Low market cap and tech... this bitch has some room to run. But it'll need to cool down. Hoping for a dip sometime in the future
GME pumping again
When you miss all the good plays and are resisting a fomo.....
ARKK flying cause why?
I thought my day sucked
The fuck do you think I am? I bought more
What's your most reliable way to scan for volatility to look for 0dte plays? I've been having good luck riding momentum and riding big swings
BA\^2
Then Elon will tweet something and wreck the index funds
The antitrust shit wasn't a grudge with Jack Ma, it was a headfake to get the RCEP done. BABA!!!
there is no fucking support, bitch. shit only ipo'd a couple weeks back haha wtf
Xpeng got the hype this week but next week it’s back to NIO on top
Hahahahaha because, because it rhymes, hahahaha and then he said apple? More like crapple! Bahahaha
It looks like 40 is like hard resistance
Baba. I’m about to bust
This is what true delusion looks like huh 😂😂
SPY volume too high imo.
I hope BABA doesn't break 300 next week so my 11/27 300c I wrote will expire worthless, then I can sell my 12/18 300c for max tendies.
Dump your savings, your boyfriends savings, your girlfriends savings, your fucking dogs savings. That shit is going up for a long time. Undervalued asf.

No idea...
Where do you hear about these early enough to jump on at such a low price?

Not baba sir, also because we bled for last 2 weeks
Hahaha!
BA FUCKING BA
BABA PLTR GANG
NIO is quite volatile after a run up. But since you're holding shares for after Nio Day then I'm certain you're confident.
TESLA JOINS DEC 21 LPAD UP
also happy cake day
It’ll be up past that again soon
Sell 11/27 BABA calls retarded or nah?
Several disruptions are expected to happen in the next 10 years that'll make investment in oil a lost cause. Autonomous driving will kickstart transport as a service. That will reduce the car ownership trend so lower milage = lower fuel consumption. Share of electric cars will increase but I guess you already know that. Does not matter how much oil companies will make shortly after the pandamic. Valuation is done based on future prospects, natural gas may sustain for a while but future of oil companies is bleak.  Electric car companies aren't going to do as well either in the long run because some research suggests that Transport as a service will significantly reduce the number of cars on the road to mere 20%.

Umm don’t know what you are getting at. Reliability is a partly subjective( read vague) metric. Using that as an indicator for stocks price is doesn’t make sense.
Markets don't give a fuck about covid. Nobody is going to force businesses outside of restaurants and schools to shut down again.
No way it's at 23.40 without major money buying in.
$40 NEXT WEEK
Long term probably NIO and CIIC
My dad’s a janitor at SPY. He said managers are throwing themselves out of windows.
NIO would be safer it’s currently under its value right now
Bruh. Dude. This is fucking awesome!
Should be higher imo, continued growth and very solid fundamentals
BABA using all my tissue supply
Sold my xpev calls yesterday when they were 150% up. Damn my paper hands.
Who called me a retard for these 260c on baba? Reveal yourself so I can make fun of you while bathing in tendies
ffs nio go join your brother XPEV at 54
Took BLNK calls when it was at $9...I took profits at $16 and I could of had a phat bagger
tards, GMHI... for the absolute final time.
wish I held my OSTK 60c 11/20 for a bitttt longer FUCK
Don't know if the float or revenue is comparable but LOGI is in the high 80s?
Buy calls
This is a Golden Corral sir
NIO IS 🚀🚀🚀
Every meme stock goes up like $5-$10 a week and RKT can’t break 22 in like two months. POS
NIO or xpeng
Don’t worry about that, I had solo 2.5c for 12/18 that I was holding for months and I decided to sell them in October
Hmmm i might buy some too lol
Yes. Always lock in your gains
100 PT is the way
Yeah but pretty soon I can buy costco size.
Fucking hell blink!!!!! No way I’m buying back in. Sold 500 shares at 7$ avg to get into PLTR. JESUS MURPHY. sold all buy 5 at 12.5

Bag holder from Kramer’s pump and dump back in.... was it august ??
PLTR CLOSING AT 20$ BY EOD
Mutha luvin BABA BABY!!!

If you’re into Baba big, friendly reminder that a couple hedges wouldnt hurt. The Dec 18 210p is only 0.63. Cheap protection if the bottom falls out for some BS Winnie the Pooh political surprise garbage
50 today or last week? Calls or shares
Lol NIO and Xpeng are still pretty new

deliveries growing significantly

but na man china ev is trash
Same can’t sell either
RIP “bought NIO at $50” gang
Might by EOD
And if you ain’t a hoe, get up out my trap house
SNE your are chomping on the tail of $90, gogogogo!
shhh don't tell them
40k into NVDA put credit spreads $30 OTM every 2 weeks gets you 8k credit. Do this 26 times and you got yourself 206k for the year ezpz. One wrong move can wipe you out, but yeah
Give me some .01 contract yolo plays
down so I can buy

the queen bey partnership? do you not remember shot up to 110 or so for 1 day and it dropped to 98 the next day
Quit buying solo! Your eating roadkill
It’s down 1%
This EV hype is pretty fucking nice. What companies do you think will do well long-term and which do you think are just pump & dump?
What would prompt a sell off. They got through earnings and had big sell of and consolidation already.  battery day in Jan
Yah, totally reeling from my still $60,000 gain on May $15 calls
Hop on the train boy

You had the right call. Just gotta trust your gut and follow the charts homie. That's why I always buy a few months out. It's also why I've started selling FD's

UTZ dark russets are the best dark russet.

I do not believe Nio is a scam, I believe people are just being too optimistic about future growth.
PLTR getting rid of all the paper hands
I can't wait till I never see that blonde bitch again and normaly returns.
CRSR only drops about $1-$2 each time it hits its new highs. Just buy in!
Okay PLTR anytime now
BABA making me cum
PLTR is literally just following the trend it has all week. This finishes above $19 EOD buckle up
bUy ThE dIp
Future bright as fuck. Target price is at least $50 a year from now.
Friendship ended with AMZN, BABA is new best friend
That’s what I’m wondering, do I secure some money by turning the calls into spreads?
Nio is supposed to be the front runner wtf lol I sold my xpeng last week 😩
Yea, I see it now. Too bad I live in Rh-less Europe and Degiro is slow af with listing stocks. Telos will be on Jupiter before they list it as "penny stock".
Nothing on the outside, nothing on the inside
BABA gang rise up
what's causing this spike?  Plus options seem kinda overpriced at thispoint?
Because it hit the bottom yesterday and is a good buy
All calls are bleeding rn tho
Thanks tbf wise words I’ll stay away
Xpeng reveals a new car model that is also a rocket ship. Stock takes off accordingly.
SE gang, rise up!!!!
Just look at kndi
Gonna be driving a lambo on Monday bitch

Fuck never buying TSLA at this rate
guys is TSLA going up or no
PLTR 19c 1/15/21 still a safe bet?
I like your confidence.  I trust internet stranger
Just read some technical analysis on stocktwits. Half of them say it's going up, half say it's going down. Why do people do this to themselves?
If PLTR could just pump one more time so I can get out green and transfer over to DKNG, that’d be nice
The whole market busting a nut about EVs and this man is going all in oil. Which means by WSB logic he’s gonna be rich
I got it and I def do not have 25k lolz
NIO is currently too low for a sell off, wait till 52 or 53
I worked in food service and tip well. I won’t order again from them. I feel the same about instacart. I don’t understand accepting a pickup when you don’t want it or if you plan to fuck with people because you want a bigger tip? That is going to be the downfall of these services.
I Cant look at Xpev no more!
What makes you say this lol
Hey guys is my fault. I bought $PLTR calls earlier this morning
oh palantiri look deep into my soul and give me tendies.
See ya on the moon, CRSR
Good luck king. CRSR 50c 12/18 because I’m poor
[removed]
Buy tesla
At this point it’s a pure gamble, it’s gonna have a major pullback in my opinion, same with SOLO
This is good advice. Or put into GBTC as a hedge against inflation.
Memes are where dreams are made

#🤡
TGT buying pressure strong despite market action last few days.

Price targets raised to $200.

If it trades at the same PE ratio with the annual EPS including this week's earnings it would be $190.

March $200 calls is free money.
[deleted]
Tesla calls are bleeding fml time to turn off the computer and not look for a week
What’s fReE mOnEy now?
This is a golden age for WSB

I can't remember a time when there where this many stocks gapping up every other day. It's beautiful

PLTR was a value investment and it PRINTED

NIO will be legendary

TSLA s&p inclusion 🐂🐂

Many, many more
Earnings on 11/30 so probably

I got 3 500c 11/27
CRSR... how high we think it gonna go? Thinking of dumping more into it.
I don’t know if I wanna jack off to this or Summer Shae.
Bought NIO at $50 😭
Got in BABA right before the squeeze. Glad it’s finally turning around.
CRSR is gonna keep mooning. It’s so undervalued and the company is just awesome.
Big volume on SNAP 1/15 calls.  Recent upgrade and they're figuring out how to monetize so this could be good.
Any thoughts on Pfizer's application with FDA?
long taysom hill
Yes, but still full of energy
Can you explain it for newbs what's the difference to true options? (also using this "shitty" German Broker - Trade Republic)
It is basically feeless and very user friendly. (1€ per Trade Buy/Sell the amount of stonks that are being bought/sold doesn't matter.)

If OP could also explain which option he bought for me to copy his brilliant gains I would be a very happy retard.
Bye tesla 🤣
did you flair yourself first?
🙏
OH NO 😆😆😳😳
If you are consistently losing money in this market, you are retarded. This is year is like a gimme.
BABA 🚀
You are asking a fellow retard such questions?
On the birder is trash

They are really trying everything to not payout NIO 50C today. Sorry, boys.
How tf did you know my exact car and mileage
Lmao!
You need $4,907,000 more to get close to winning.
So happy I held on to SBE as long as I have. Shit is finally getting its EV pump 💪
BABA boys will finally become BABA men
FAANG dead. Dow dead. WSB memes alive

Idk but I regret not loading back up on it at 40 Jesus Christ I expected more out of NIO it’s so undervalued right now it needs to be higher
How are futs gonna open sunday evening?

CRSR going to the fucking moon

AAPL $130 11/27
Ban. Stop spewing lies on WSB.
Hard to say. Not sure what your risk tolerance is or size of your account but I put in another 850 this morning in 2021 calls. Unbothered that they're negative for now because there's a lot of time left on them. If it's me, I assume today's low is lower than Monday's low.
Dumped FSR...doesn’t look like it’s gonna breakout to the upside. Sad...was rooting for henrik Fisker too
If it flys, floats, or fucks, lease it
I sold at open when it was up. Too much movement elsewhere.
If you actually value the opinions on this forum (and that’s saying something) then this is a great question to ask BEFORE the YOLO.
6 autists can change the world.
You could do a covered position. Either covered calls or covered shorts, and take advantage of the sick IV
Fugg me. Tried to get in this morning and didn’t. Now
just watching from the sidelines.
r/weeniestreetbets
i think it moons next week, i have a feeling, but too scared to get burned by long calls, imagine virus fears hit the market randomly and everything trades down 2-3%, id get fucked on my long call...
Bears in shambles 
Bulls in shambles
Theta gang in 1997 Honda Civic with 289k mileage
Just chilling.  

Was hoping for a parabolic move, but up $7 in three days, it's natural to take a breather.  

If volume starts to drop down Monday, though, will bail with my tendies and wait for a lower re-entry.

Fuk it. All in on BABA!!!!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I watched it but there was no support for the 65% needed for approval , the guy said "I think". I haven't seen anything on SEDAR or any media releases that indicate that.
There's something besides options?
I drive a e92 m3 6mt I’m never selling this babe with eight cylinders, fuck the earth
BABA LEFUCKINGOOOO
I'm not sure.  I think I'll wait and see if it continues to dip next week.
Dude, please don't do this anymore if you're serious. This isn't even a game for people with a few thousand to risk.
Correct, it’s not broken
Sell half. Buy pton with $
PLTR is still just testing support. No indication of a downtrend

Is TSLA outta gas?
Because most retards on this sub are one dimensional. Pick a meme stock, lay a bet. Tesla S&P addition was announced, I bought calls in ETFs that follow Tesla. Free. Money.
Either up or down man, that's my guess.
NVDA is being a bitch. Just need that shit to get to 534-535 so I can get out.
What are those things called, Himalayas?
buy high sell low
Somehow accidentally timed Citrons tweet with me buying a put on SOLO. Let's hope it pays off
Aight bought 4 lets see whassup
Crsr will continue to moon
This is the way
besides daddy buffet
What is LineRider?
Yes for 2 days gtfo with your garbage assumptions retard lmao, also Alibaba is the fucking Amazon on China how tf does that compare to garbage PLTR?
I've started flairing commenters as retarded if they post some baseless shit so I can avoid them in the future
You got a good plan. Looking out to June you're chillin
i finished reading the 20-F. The company feels like a decent company unlike most vaporware pennystocks. In for $20k.

I did like that fact they do have actual patents in china and the US + trademarks in china.

>130 patents in China and six patents in the United States, and as of December 31, 2019 it had 18 pending patent applications in China and three pending patent applications in the United States. 

And collaborations with major companies including Intel, Qualcomm, Marvell, LGE, Micromax, Acer, Motorola and Vizio.
Who the fuck is still buying up SOLO?
No u
Thanks for the info. Nio sounds like most scams.
Sorry I’m new here so here’s my positions
Even then we're retarded enough to think that it will bounce on BK
MSFT is trading flatter than the curvature of the earth right now after major spasms this morning. 🌎🌍🌏
\-looks up BLNK premiums either way-

For this reason, I'm out
Great
No. Telstra is Aus company. Look for Telos
This is potato Elon
if you're on a platform supporting warrants, dump it into PSTH
Yeah, but the market is.

Anyone have any idea what the ftiv spac is?? Its called fintech and its up 200% today. The autist inside me yearns to be free
I don't go for DD's unless I've seen 6 digit returns on the poster's previous plays. The rest are pump and dumps and I've been burned on more than one.

Honestly a profit is a profit. I'd take that $25k than risking a sell off.
Dude what the hell is going on with xpeng
Probably mad their NIO short didn't work

Imagine calling your company rocket when it’s just a flat balloon.
Corsair thank you for the bags of cash that you made me. Made my money back on stupid ATVI and then some. The new autist hope
18.5 is support I think
Sounds like it allows for teachers to do less work if you were able to cheat that easily. 

If I know anything about people who pursue careers in education its that those lazy sacks will do anything to avoid work. Those who can't do, teach.Those who can't teach, teach gym. Those who can't teach gym, teach WSB trading techniques. 

Even if it's an inadequate teaching method doesn't mean it won't continue being used or adopted by other educating departments. If it makes for less work by teachers, it will continue being used and will be adopted by other educating departments looking to reduce work.
I started following u. thanks so far
I know I like an inside bar in PLTR today.
Finally someone understands me, anyone who is buying a car that’s worth more than 50K$ in China will be leaning towards brand from Europe or Tesla. At least their decision making process will start from this mental state.
The way this is moving means someone with lots of money is investigating. I don't think the movement is due to retail investors. Maybe someone know something we don't. But all my contacts are 6m out so I'm good.
I can't read this. Put it in Robinhood format.
Y’all might be retarded. But at least you’re not “sold a Dec 4 OSTK $63.5c yesterday” retarded
Baba gonna make me yeet
I just started learning about SPACs (also thought you said being *in* PSTH was dumb). I should probably start throwing cash at it now. I need to do some more research so I can gauge how the warrants may dilute the price later on
Shitron

Closing the week out which way?
AMD🚀🚀🚀
Not to late, we only 15 above the low
Yea 100%. I'll look way better being all sweaty and out of breath from running places than pulling up in that thing 😂
As soon as Tesla takes its foot off the gas a little some of y'all just drop it? Smh, oh ye of little faith
It's true tho
GME chart is a perfect ramp rn for LineRider
Citron is right, SOLO's head office isn't a corporate office. just an apartment building

i posted this on someone's DD post, but the concept of a small EV has been around for a long time.

what is SOLO doing that's better than Mercedes, which already has a tiny EV car?

What’s your time horizon?
I just bought $50K of both just to be safe.
tbf ascending wedge is actually bearish, but I'm holding for the long term so IDGAF
End of next week.
You think 500 is possible next week or near at least?
Is anybody playing the CIIC game today? Worth it or wait til Monday?
I see you’ve got yourself a young Candanavian options trader
How far do you guys expect PLTR to dip?
I rolled profits over into 2022 leaps in the money. Gonna keep buying near the money calls 3 months out and rotating profits into leaps.
this whole week has been hot
12/18 17.5c... let's do this
I see you post about XPEV a lot. Tryna get the algorithms pumping? Lol
Seems like I missed the boat on ZM. You think its going to $500 next week?
Slept in but my NIO shares up.  Thinking about profit taking up $25k currently. 

Where should be my next move.  Shares only I have about $130k to work with
lol at all the PLTR call options that will expire worthless today

SUMO finally breaking out today
Source??
I bought 68 shares at $2, sold at $3, fuck me with a red hot poker.
CRSR above $40 now. We’re in new territory.
CRSR 40 BOOM
Both my SPY and TSLA puts are in the money. Now all I need is an end of day dump.
my main play of the week was spy puts or baba calls and guess what i chose
With the lockdowns/ truckers going on strike/ no stimulus news/ “Joe Biden’s “ dark winter statement we gon see red on Monday.

$190? What the fuck is this?
Ok thanks for that insight
I’m not a spammer it was my first post, and if you kept it up people could have made a lot of money
Why is AMZN being such a limp dick
Now hp is taking off too, best of luck on the gains brother
it's your own fault for buying puts.
The way XPEV is ripping away, this feels like a buying opportunity for NIO
I mean they are wrong like 95+% of the time. It isn’t illegal to post an opinion about a stock’s valuation though. The problem is people for some reason think it’s valuable insight.
Defintely. There is a strong possibility of a sell off after this run and after the merger date. But SBE/ChargePoint is a must for stocks to buy and hold early next year.
no
I read somewhere they got a lot of investment funding and have tons of cash
Had 50 coins left m. Thanks brotha
You peak in your 20s? Idk about that. But life is indeed a PandD
I sold SQ and BABA calls earlier today that I planned on holding for at least a month... bought em two days ago

Yeah, I could see it going down some more, but I got Jun calls, so i’m not too worried. I’ll just average down if it dips.
At what point do we just start hammering puts on this? How many consecutive days can we see this continue to put up 20% gains?
I seriously don’t know why y’all still sleep on sumo logic, solid ass company, multiple times cheaper than its competitors. Working with all kinds of major companies. I can see this stock easier blow through 80bucks
Yea I would roll it out
Coming from the guy 100% in china stocks
ZM calls
Pure gamble.
WH saying same BS about vaccine. 

The actual virologist on CNBC is saying that the vaccines will help but will take time to administer it and we have to take precautions on the spread right now by providing people support so they don't have to go to work and shit. He also says they don't have any access to anything because Trump admin is blocking them so a transition can't take place.
this is the reason why i sold too

How do u have robinhood in canada?
:))
Good shit bro. Def gonna average down when the selling starts.
Word. I think it’ll pump toward earnings then maybe dip a bit. Just a guess but guidance will likely be good tho conservative. I’m in for long term, I think they have a good chance at restructuring. 6k shares and a 100 CSPs. I’ll load up on more shares and CSPs sub-11.5. I hope tards here size their positions to limit paper handies.

People here require 100% gains in 10 minutes to be happy.
FOH, I got it back. 45 EOD
Discord? There’s a discord? Nah, make your plans based SOLELY on memes my dude. Memes make da money.
They literally got banned from China or at least Left did
Since I have the longest cock I figured I should buy the longest calls 

Oil LEAPS 1/2023
Wish I had a few $TSLA puts...
Citron tweet was pretty funny too
I’m still bagholding leaps, I’m not going anywhere
Did it? Lol
Imagine not buying TSLA below 500
[removed]
Sold my solo bc last friday citron fucked me on nio
120% is good man. I would take it and enjoy my weekend stress-free!
I got PDT to get it back, fuck it. LOL
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Took my profits a bit too early on some BABA, PTON and SE calls. Oh well, hopefully I can get into better positions next week.
trade desk, shop, square, etc. pick your poison, they are all outperforming

MMs fucking the pigs.
avg daily is 50,679,610
I sure hope so. I’m in deeper than Johnny Simms was before COVID.
Not the top. Every new lockdown is a pump. We’re gonna get two weeks of pumps.
Dysgraphia can be a symptom of cortical stroke.
Does anyone else think SPY’s price action is very similar to yesterday
Tightened my trailing stops. This is getting scary
Soros is an idealist at heart.  He sees investments and money as secondary tools to the true goal of "making the world a better place."

Those ideals are globalist nonsense that's massively damaging Europe in particular, but Soros doesn't have to deal with those problems because A. He's already rich, and B. He'll die soon anyways, full of warm fuzzies.

I think this is more about him virtue-signalling.  What good is disinvesting in a company you think is evil if no one knows how good you were by disinvesting? (after you made money)
<3 you GMHI
NVDA hath foresaken us
Hi bankruptcy, it's Dad.
Chargepoint (SBE) is a real company with huge room to run.  Best EV growth play rn
Must be having a great afternoon!
I bought this juicy PLTR dip we can only go up from here
We holdin PTON 130 calls over the weekend??👀
1.5
It had already dumped the prev Friday on the Citron hit piece
I keep missing out on these fucking pumps so infuriating.
once again the rich just get richer while the poor get poorer
10% in a year is boomer status, 300% could just be from buying low selling high and selling contracts on some lucky buys
KXIN the biggest pump and dump in histroy
Everything EV is skyrocketing. Who wants to start an EV company with me?
really?
BABA🚀💸

Now for some good weekend news on the ant ipo to gap up Monday
3/19 280c checking in
Snap and TGT calls 😘
I'm sorry bro, losing 50% of your portfolio really blows sometimes
Can we just go green please I only have 2 and a half hours for my calls to hit
If you would like to learn how to turn that in to 5k over the next few months, hmu.
I feel this on a personal level
Still have
I think it's more about media picking up on citron shite hence making it seem "influential"
Whales making moves
EV gang 🤑🤑🤑
If you haven't gone cash over the weekend in a while. Just be mindful of how much less stress you have if you don't enter a trade today.
baba bagholders can breathe now
Pray for me
CRSR boutta bust 40
Not at in but close enough when you’re only working with a few inches here
already got my answer
Locked in some DKNG leaps. $75 for next May...
Your graph is similar to mine oddly enough our money is the same too I’m at 31.5 though 😭
what are the random 3mil SPY candles all about?
Oh thanks bro. Need to deposit 2k more I guess haha
A tale as old as time
300 EOY
Has citron ever been proving wrong and then sued for defamation?
Probably the smart move, but hard not be greedy
Wow I actually sold SOLO at the $13 peak with a 40% gain. I usually get greedy and lose money
XPEV about to leap up again
Virus-shmirus
BREAKING: Area man sways market with random Reddit comment.
Yeah me too - no big dips lately
You don’t need to lie to boost sale numbers, there are better ways to do it. My people are so good at it there are companies relying entirely on subsidiaries. But even if the sales numbers are 100% correct, it will be an uphill battle for future growth
at least 200
just roll it until the end of time and it becomes the problem of your grandkids, easy.
SOLO has to be the dumbest shit I've ever seen.....shit product shit company, but stock goes up astronomically in 1 week.  At least NIO had some sort of logic behind it.  We really are just trading 3 letters on a screen nothing else matters.
BABA is exiting the atmosphere

See you plebs later
When the fuk CIIC gonna launch 🚀 🚀 🚀
Yup feels like they are trying to unload a lot before the hype collapses
who’s holding 20 C PLTR JAN 15 over the weekend?
[removed]
No far?
He says it’s going to keep popping so maybe he means it will keep raising
buy the SPCE dip
I get it now thank you!
what a weird week
ouch, I feel this.
Never sell at a loss when you have shares
[deleted]
[deleted]
mot fool?
I think the worst part about losing money on puts is when boomer investors that you know say oh the markets been killing it and you lost like 10k last week
L
At least $503, optimistically up to like $525
man you have no life...
WHAT THE FUCK TD GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
Thank you citron for the solo dip
nio popping off man, u should exit
SPY is overvalued imo.
Solo free falling
XPENG picking up steam again. Cucks thought Friday was sell off like last 2 weeks but this thing is blasting through the ceiling.  May need to pick up some over the weekend calls and make a shrine to Pooh
Fsly play for next week
Duke Deuce - Crunk Ain't Dead
This app of yours is misspelling stonks. Fcking retarded.
Just left PLTR going back to my original BAE 
XPENG. 

Take me back baby I’m a fool!
It’s up like 3 %...
Have to have 25k
Should I sell my Dec PLTR 18c for 120% and roll into a higher strike? Or do i let this ride until it’s deeper in the money?
wtf it moves that slowly? each contract is 30 dollar a piece, its not bad right? or is it dumb to buy leaps when the underlying stock price is cheaper than the contract? haha
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
So we are just going to have a million vaccines floating around by diff companies? This seems like a mess.
Wow, so you underperformed my savings account, but with 10X the stress 🤣
This gives me anxiety
BABA going parabolic again holy fuck
That's why I loaded up on 15 12/18 300 calls for 1.8
try three fiddy
But SOLO is obviously the EV of the future????

^(jesus)
280 eom
Wtf is happening to growth? Half a mind to cash out. Seems like MM are baiting retail hard to fomo into meme stocks then massive rug pull.
Sooo who's holding calls over the weekend? I got some Dec and Jan that I'll prob jeep a bit longer but not sure about 11/27 ones.
Guys. There’s enough meat on this solo bull for everyone. C’mere.
[deleted]
fuck pltr i sold it too
Heard rumors that RH has 0DTE options now but dont see it in the settings? Anyone know if it true and how to activate it?
Citron dont need to say shit about that company.  
SOLO is a fucking joke with their clown cars.
Znga get in now
Dollars or hundred? Dude, please stop if it's dollars.
Feels like the establishment wants to divert attention away from it.
Germany considering extended lockdown, Canada extended the border closure with the US and Trump is trying to withhold stimulus so he can prove that Biden tanked the economy...

S&P - 0.3% - seems legit...
Position to make it green: BABA 260c and 270c 1/15/21
tickers? thats all the DD I need
This mother fucker has went the opposite way everytime ive played it
[deleted]
NIO finally ded?
What is this reversal on solo
That volume on SOLO
Oof sorry man. I fomo’d back in to xpev after I sold those calls and bought more 50c 11/20s. Then sold for a 80% loss because I panicked then robinhood crashed and wouldn’t let me cancel the limit sell. Those were up to like 100% around their earnings. I fucking suck at this. Need to inject diamonds in my hands or something
😂😂😂  I expect him to soon tho 😂😂😂
ZM ZM ZM $450 EOD
I need one of those illegal fake and gay pumps
Is tesla gonna stay >500
NIU should release some solid numbers pre market on Monday. Get it while it’s down 💪
Such is life
Tbh we get 3590 eod we will see an attempt for it next week.
So that is all good, but I don't like selling naked calls.... knowing my luck Elon musk will tweet a pick of his gaming PC and say Corsair to the moon. Then we Are eff'd.
Oh BABA you're so kind🤭
It's not a bubble if it never pops. Fundamentals are no longer relevant. The stock market is pure gambling my friend.
Don't bother posting this shit if you don't say the positions. Pissed me off so much
I sold
FCEL V shape inbound. buy the dip
This is the kind of stock I'd load heavy on after an inevitable bubble getting them cheap.
PLTR daily vol at 41M already in under 3 hours into trading, above 36M average daily volume.

Stock is down... bearish?
Were talking avout our 11/20 calls
Stop overestimating Citron’s influence people. Those chumps only have 192k followers. My ugly ex gf has more.
Just say sorry
I don't think their business model makes much sense, or can deliver much growth longterm
LMAO U TRASH PLTR IS DUMPING
Come on SQ just hit 200... You know you want to 😏
what you got
Holding 1/15 25 C

Sold my 11/20 15C on Tuesday for a measly 250% 🤡
I like that she’s wearing green, bullish af especially on green energy stocks
PLTR is so fucking annoying. I'm going to hold obviously but I can't help but think my money would've been better used copping more NIO.
IV on my baba calls gay af
What is the song? Shit got me pumped
What's a good yolo I can do with $2k?
That’s a big if.
I don't
Only sold solo I bought at 9 at 13 today 350 shares, not bad not bad but other than that boring market today
0.25% is worse than inflation lol. But congrats on digging yourself out
Ive cried all week......
Is this the plug rug?
What is the target price on gme just curious the future seem so dark for gme still
BABA price prediction??
Crsr and xpev holding it down for me while two ipos from this week i went balls deep in are getting their shit together
baba gonna hit 300 again EoY
I hate that PLTR is popular here
I lost $12 today .. may seem small for you guys but its like the world to me
I bought PTON top 🤡
that's a good point thanks
Oh no, X company I know absolutely nothing about is dumping, why???
copy thx
It’s not shit if it’s true.
u/variation-separate has returned. 3666 will be the start of the reckoning
CITRON sour af
and now it’s down 2%....it rlly just needs mainstream attention, which hopefully will come with the ANT ipo, whenever that is
Do you really think they show the same articles to everyone? They probably tell half the world to buy and half the world to sell.
Small caps are now green. That’s where they belong. Now, to buy back my short call that’s going to expire worthless and roll it for next week. Need more premium.
SPY just shit yourself already and get it over with
With both hands.
Short Morgan Stanley, safest bet ever, these guys are morons
Wait, we are in a bear market?

*Always have been*
how far up you think it will go today
IV on SOLO is nuts
Amazing.
[deleted]
what the actual fuck

i bought blink shares into earnings, they tanked. sold for a loss at 9.5.

now its 23.
dont talk about mommy like that
crsr new max hope yall didnt sell
Buy june puts on SOLO and forget about it.  Eventually the meme power will wear off on EVs and SOLO will go back to being a stupid penny stock.
How did you do this lol
PLTR up 80% before anyone on this sub even knows about it, it dips 2% and suddenly I’m a bag holder
[deleted]
Idk she’s giving me a chub rn bruv
[deleted]
Daddy Elon is so good to us
I’m giving you Ideanomics early. I know they’re completely different companies/products but compare the SOLO chart and the Ideanomics chart.
feel free to purchase 1 contract of each to follow along, I just bought them all about 5 minutes ago
*The most courageous call on this show is Pete wearing that vest*

Oooof he has a family
yes
Likely to be a survey amongst people who can actually afford to buy a NIO - but would rather not.  General sentiment from the class that NIO is trying to target.

Poor people can't afford it. 

Rich Chinese people know how shit works in China.  They're not buying them.

He's asserting that middle class people don't want them either.  Very telling.
I have QQQ 293/292.5 call credits expiring today ...  this is brutal WTF
So rotation back into wfh? & amazon has been such a bitch today
You make me horny
BABA PUMP
SOLO boys are rotating back into TSLA please
Not in SOLO......but citron is a cunt.
[deleted]
nooo pton dont stop baby
We all know what's happening this time
What did they say?
Can’t wait for Monday open at $550
Sorry no evidence I’ve seen rumors nothing solid
It was so undervalued glad i bought some at 250
Despite the pain and suffering behind this, this brought a smile to my face.
They are going to run to $100 next year
We're gonna close at 13.5 today! Bring ittttttt!
Oh right Asia, that continent that just stops a little north of the equator,,,
I’m just saying take profits in ayro/solo since they’re pumping to the max
Dumping my FSR calls...been a fun ride boys :/

Why did he delete the post
For sure I just put $500 in Robinhood but it didn't receive instantly so looks like I got to wait a little before putting half in PLTR
Just day trade with a cash account. And don't go all in everytime you place an order
TSLA selling has stopped... quick! Panic buy before the dip disappears
Hold. Don’t listen us
SPCE calls cheap
Mondays have been green 86.8% of the time over the last 6 months, fridays have been red 74.9% during that same time frame. Would be better to sell monday if you are going to.
Ah yes. Just about time to sell to open some NIO 55c. Come & get ‘em!

Went cash gang for nearly 24 hours. It feels weird and dirty and I didn't make any money. 10/10 do not recommend.
What do we think about PFE calls for July 2021?
Rude
GSX pretty much admitted fraud today and their stock isn't down to lower than what it was before all the fraud claims by Muddy Waters earlier this year. They said they "spent a ton more this last quarter" aka we had to make up an excuse why our profits tanked this quarter.
CIIC gang 📈📈
I vouch for Cyrusis as he has done his research and has followed this company for months. He told me to buy when this stock was at 80. 

He is the way.

Going to 160. EXPI going to 80 as well so get on that board too
OSTK getting out of the doghouse???
I got a $15 c 12/17/21 and idk what to do
Less than 10 word post without a screenshot? Ban
>One argument i hear is that there are other companies doing the same thing more profitably who can take market share from them. 

Google search Project Maven and then tell me there are other companies doing what Palantir does, but more profitably.

This is a Cyberpunk 2077 sort of long term play my dude.
Software companies are the move rn
Haters
Up 86% on SOLO, cashed out a bit just to be safe. Feels like a shitcoin
Never thot I'd say this but Blackberry > Apple
**PLTR runs 80% in a week**

Retards: HOLY SHIT IM IN NEGATIVE ON PALANTIR TODAY, LETS SELL IT
MACD on 1month crossing. Could be bearish. Sellers are starting to come out on DMI for the first time in 3 months. I want in CARR bad but it could be a bit cheaper next week
Amazing company, needs more hype
Just call them on the phone

$19.66 - $18.62 = $1.04 dump. Over 5%
Should I get in on PTON or is it to late
lol she looks like a drag queen
Holy shit this firm specializes in this stuff. I was looking for this DD. Thanks. This really legitimizes Cohen’s letter. You don’t send this letter to just fade away....
BABA I’ve been pounding the table all fucking week.

Tf are you talking about?
oh my god my SQ calls YES.  Why didn't I bet more sigh
July $7.50c for ~$2.00 is a steal.
Whoa lets pump the breaks. Where the fuck did you gather my comment as a downside to your comparison? 

As a type 1 diabetic, is it fundamentally wrong allowing pharm to negotiate directly with insurance companies and having competition snuffed by gov't regulations allowing pharm to set their own prices resulting in $600 for one prescription of insulin compared to $25 for one prescription of the same insulin? Yes. 

As an investor, fuck you pay me. ("You" implies the sick not you personally)
Mh, what about a short strangle for 35p/55c?

Gets you about 4.70 in premium.
Bet he didn’t

“Let it ride!”
This week's FD SOLO puts are worthless, fuck it im buying them again next week.
We'll see. Out of four positions, three are itm right now.
Haha, I guess this was expected from degenerates like us in Wallstreetbets lol. You're on a hot streak. Congrats.
I'm feeling like a star,  
you can't stop my shine,  
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky,  
I'm SOLO, I'm ridin' SOLO
I know we don’t often do our DD here, but SOLO has absolutely no business being over like $6
Been eyeing 50c 6/21 but waiting for a dip to buy in.
SQ almost to 200...I’m so hard

If you don’t have BABA you don’t like money. Jack Ma hasn’t been found in a dumpster yet so we are in the fucking clear. WERE GOING TO THE CHINESE MARS
he got in at 104. I bet hes having a good day

Take profits on 108 pton call 12/4 or hold

Search up MacPro i9 thermal throttle on youtube
H?
Built quality of Nio is actually better compare to early model 3s, don’t know how it is now. Price wise, Nio has no advantage what so ever, model 3 is the best selling mid size luxury sedan dominating for several month( yep, in the whole sector including ice cars). I also heard from my buddy who bought model s, Nio ES8 Highway mileage is inflated. I just don’t know where is Nio making profit, they spent an crazy amount of money on luxury stores, marketing, they buy their battery packs, they buy their autonomous driving unit from mobile eye, they pay JAC to manufacturing their cars. Battery swap takes five minutes but you need to wait in line for at least half an hour. For me, things just don’t add up, and now Tesla is making their cars in China with huge quantities, competition is fierce. But everyone believes market is big enough for all brands to thrive.

r my PTON 11/20 170c gonna print or what
I sold NIO $30 calls for a 50% loss the day before it started its rally. Those calls were worth $60k a week later.
Mary Barra isn't Elaine Musk but she can be a Sally Nadella
Lol who is next on citron list? Ayro?
buy SOLO AYRO FUV


This is only the first few days of retarded pump

There will be more opportunities

Hi 👋 I'm the idiot who bought ayro at the top. Stop by and say something nice
Bought my first call in baba yesterday LFGO 11/27 280c
Citron trying their luck at SOLO
Super tight range on spy the last few mins. Expect a large move either way
Watch the YouTube video and skip to 55 min. You're missing CI investments as well. It's closer to 55% with just these guys and there's multiple firms stating they haven't heard anyone in favor of this.
PTON going vertical 🚀
Watch BABA ascend into the heavens without me becuase I sold my calls at open for only a measly 110% gain hurts
mouth breathing i see. big suprise, the shit apple doesnt fall from the shit tree retard. happy trading mano
Y'all gonna hate me for this, but this is why you buy shares on BABA. You can always swing trade shares short term too, with no theta decay.
BABA where u going today bby 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
Do you hate money?
Wow, brutal
If you want a rich buy palantir
Without a working vaccine, it's hard to figure out the rest. The best Pfizer has is 15 days validity on dry ice so far.

Solo
Loadin up on BALY calls to run through next week
do NOT buy the solo dip
You should also consider that NIO, XPEV, LI are making under 100k cars per year...at this point. If they keep growing this fast their business and car amounts you are going to see those cars a lot. Or your relatives will. 

How many cars tesla, BMW, Mercedes and Audi makes? How long have they been in Business?

I'm not pro but I would say everyone is investing to future. How big those companies will be in next 5 years?
Love AMZN flat - it’s so strange watching it compared to the 100$ swings
[deleted]
Other commneter said buy $250 today and then another $250 on Monday. Good idea? I'm still a new retard here
excuse me? you must have a small penis
You momos could of bought leaps on PLTR and still be up significantly like me. Sorry forgot where I was.
Getting ready to load up on calls any minute now...
You making that play?

Just like two weeks ago it was pricing in vaccine news?

Sadly, I'm gonna be putting about 1k a month from here though.
Where is that fucking guy who put $1M into PTON lmaooooo wtf
Lmao @ ppl hating on PLTR. It has its daily ups and downs but is consistently moving up. It's kind of meme stock, but not really. Everyone knows it's only going to grow as its deeply tied to the US govt. 

Never doubt the PayPal mafia guys.

Does he mean...invest a loan? God save us all
Hes got a lot of personal things that should cause him discomfort. At least for me, it wouldnt balance out.
yup! i was agreeing with you
So many bearish articles on Tesla tells me to go CALLS TO THE WALLS
Not really a report. Just a tweet stating solo is a joke and they're going back to $2
i swear if i paper handed these  SOLO calls for 12/18 imma be upset
That's fucking awesome. I hope you're not buying weeklies with money like that, though.
Uhhhh PLTR please wake the fuck up thanks
Not bad for a years work.
I had sq 190C 11/20 and I paperhanded them 😭😭
Honestly their cars look like retarded tricycles
I \*\*\*FINALLY\*\*\* took the dip in today at the top after hearing it for 2 weeks and it goes down right after. FML. AMA???

Just shares bud. It’s a bit risky with the CCP going after Ma’s ass. He could be found in a dumpster any day now. 35k worth of shares at $262.00
Targeting SOLO. check their twitter
Just realized BALY has av average volume of 300K lol

The point is this: you don't know what the fuck you're doing. Stop squandering your money on shit you don't understand.

If you want me to be your lawyer, you'll have to pay my hourly rate, and I'm going to venture a guess that you can't afford it.
Fuck I’m the fucking retard
Bout to panic sell PLTR calls for basically nothing -,-
Bologna*
If you’re panic selling PLTR you are actually retarded
Is this as low as it will go for the day?
TDA pushing an article called “This may be the time to sell Tesla stock”....
doesn't matter if you are willing to hold the stok
F
Lol true, basically I went from buying cheap almost expired options to just day trading stock and buying options when I got a good opportunity. I hope I can keep the momentum up
buying 6 20$ calls with a max price of 420? meme funny number? must be my destiny
You made $7
The last two days looking pretty bullish like just before it broke out of the 50-58 range.
apha, aphira cannabis infused beverageco

 around 6 dollar share
Fuck you
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
He's the biggest retard of them all. He belongs here with us
I’m officially green all time again. This of course will vanish by EOD but let’s burn some black tar goodness to celebrate shall we?
You're no autist. You're a savant. 👏

Homegirl doesn’t seem to have her normal pizzazz.
I want to vomit. The xpev 40c 12/18 I sold for 200$ profit is up like 1200$ from what I paid
It could, hence the downside protection. It would need to drop to 32 for you to start losing money
I have maybe one green position right now and I'm all over the place
Pltr is fine. This isn’t alarming lmao
Link to SOLO citron report?
[deleted]
SOLO
August 2.0 and I haven’t bought anything 🤡🤡🤡 let alone I still haven’t bought anything since July 24th even though I watch the market daily from open to close 🤡🤡🤡🤡 then we gonna dump and I missed out on one of the easiest months ever
Yo ARK is really killing it across the board
However you want to rationalize it, I'm not here to stop you.
Sell and roll, take profits
True dat.
Always sus of someone who doesn’t show their all-time
SOLO RIP CITRON 🌈
What makes you think that he’s not happy though?
Stupid ass tweet
Bears be stoked about a $0.50 movement lol
same, was up 50% on my calls for next week. guess im stuck holding
They’ve been figuring out production storage and transportation for months - it’s just a question about how fast it can be manufactured.
Done
should I go all cash before EOD
I wanna buy baba but I don’t want to get screwed again
Profit is profit

This is my point, what ive seen of Tesla and Nio is that your not just buying a car, you are buying a lifestyle choice. 

The tech, toys and gimmicks of a Tesla and the quality and battery swapping of Nio (including subscription service) in particular tell me these are more than cars, just like your  phone is now just not for making calls.

Dunno bout you, but no stipend is worth the cost of my RE of one converted bedroom office. 1500sqft, 800k, each bedroom is ~150 sqft, so the cost of this office is 80k, and you're getting a stipend of 1500... Lol 

Truthfully though, I get some only need a laptop or w.e, but i go home to stay home not stay at work, so literally one room has to be compartmentalized.
Will do. When's the crash again?
Yea lol which is why I thought about jumping
I'm down for the argument against it. It exceeded earnings expectations and long term, I think the trends towards remote work and temporary positions/gig economy will continue - and I don't think the Biden administration will implement worker-friendly policies to regulate against that.
Hey since you got pretty lucky, why not donate like 100 bucks to the autism foundation and post a pic? Give back to the community.
AYRO IPO ed a few months ago. You are looking at a different company which used AYRO before.

If you think the only thing the government does with information gathered through intelligence is spy on Americans, you dont know what you're talking about. Which is fine, I'm not chastising you for it. 99% of Americans have no clue what goes on behind the scenes. 

Based on some of the DD I've read, and what I know about information warfare and what goes on in the DoD, this is a long hold. China, Russia, and the rest of the world is constantly looking for an edge over America and is frequently attacking us in that space. If this technology is as real as I've read, which based on new contracts with the DoD is true, it's going to be a great investment.

Nice. Was eyeing 0DTE that’s up 300% now but TD fucked me
TLT isn't seeing much selling drag recently 🤔
That’s kinda of the point don’t you get it? If everyone runs out of the same exit people get stuck. It’s been slow on low volume, but the tape is clear there’s more volume to the sell side then the buy consistently. Retail is eating it all up tho. Haven’t you noticed that volume tanked after the election?
Remember when baba was being an absolute monster for the first 3/4 of this year?

Don't you wanna experience that?
I would love to see PLTR hit 20 EOD
With biden taking office? The EV bubble might go higher before you make money on those puts
They’re doing in store only PS5 pickup on Black Friday
Once SQ breaks 200 we're mooning
Anyone else's PLTR puts printing rn?

PLTR also has meme strength. Taking a break today but the 1-2% loss of today will mean nothing come 2021
She's 90 pounds lol, she's a hottie tho. Just got dumped by her fiance
I would’ve suggested BABA calls yesterday
Aye
Got calls on the SOLO dip here
You can't sue Citron for simply stating facts.  Yes, the facts behind SOLO are fucking retarded beyond belief.  That's the stupid shit the market is buying right now.  The crash will come and it'll be hard.  It is a penny stock.
NIO likes to take some sleeps before going on another run
Whats option got you there?
Not even going to look at my portfolio since nobody is talking about nio
Goood thing I sold baba calls yesterday and bought Amazon
Helping me recover from these stupid spy pooots I have.  Thank you BABA 🚀
Indeed, but he's living proof that money can't buy happiness.  Or realistic looking hair.

It's not that it's bipolar it's just that banks and hedge funds have been selling slowly but surely and retail has been buying slowly but surely.
You don’t consider being the most well known and widely used betting app a unique service? Not to mention, arguably the most attractive and easy to use. I consider that the same as buying a Mercedes va a Honda, you want to be seen in the Mercedes vs the Honda. DRAFTKINGS is the Mercedes.

BABA - “put the team on my back”
Great point. Adding to it, the vaccine news will make people more careless. The vaccines are proven effective but they have a long way to go. FDA approval, production, storage, transportation all this needs to be figured out before it can be considered a true solution.

The market popped but the finer details still need to be ironed out. We're in for a bumpy ride
Let's make it just a little homo.
I know. Been in both those stocks for months. Short, long, strangled. 

MSFT loves 200-210-215 expiration fuckery. 
AAPL been teasing that 118-120 for a few days. Frustrating, I know. Just swiped some tiny tendies this week. Could take it anymore & that is just the way they like it.

That's an inspirational block of text! I get it and I agree with you on the Chinese situation. I was not as aware of Tesla's exposure to the Chinese market. I was actually more curious about the FUV/AYRO/SOLOs of the world, haha.
What’s their symbol going to be?
Sorta gives me reassurance it wont dump like a motherfucker
Or the more likely of scenario $0.00 SPY puts expiring worthless
Yeah, but in my eyes AAL would have a drastically higher chance than CCL at recovering, and yet AAL has been falling this week while CCL and NCL rose pretty high. And look at everything going on w CCL, seems like they’re really feeling the COVID, more now than ever.

You’re fucking over.
The canadian-american hybrid makes the best trades too. Truly gifted.
honestly if u didnt sell your SOLO calls today... for some gains :S I dunno man. IV was juicy!
If you're not worried about 80% of shares becoming available and a large sell off from early investors and employees compensated with options then you shouldn't be worried about a 2% or 5% drop in share price but yet you are. How do you make sense of that?
Why did this post get removed?
Lmao I kinda wanna short it cause I don't like SOLO either, but after their dumbass NIO report I wonder if this one will have any impact at all.
It is insane to me that people are dumping money into SOLO that’s not just like an option gamble from yesterday
Yo that girl in messenger be thicccc doe
I was disappointed that I sold early yesterday but now I don’t look like such a retard.
I got out of SBE 25c when it was climbing around $26 at open. Good $7k gains. Will get back in once the inevitable selling stops.

The CEO's NIO and LI started these car sales companies just before they started their EV companies.  Owning an "independent" car sales platform seems like a really good way to get away with lying about sales numbers.
inverse the morons
Id say buy $250 right now. Hold off on the other $250 until Monday. It’ll let you dilute your average buying price. That’s how I got in at $15, I kept buying on the pullbacks
Okay I'll start small then. Thanks!
The most special at least
BABA
TSLaaa to 486
Yes sir

What's the IPO date. Can't find it anywhere
Did your fat retard fingers buy that instead of Palantir?
It’s literally crack for children. There are a lot of children, and crack is highly addictive. Roblox is easy money.
doesn't look like it has strength today to me, I'm looking to buy back AH or Monday PH
Mortgages were booming but now market outlook scary turns out jumps aren't as big except in luxury market so next year is a big ? And meme stock is meme stock so dump eet. Also this isn't even really a dump its just a minor correction. Don't buy weeklies when the market is scurred.
Sold 7.5 calls lol. On the upside I also sold $3p so those will likely expire worthless.
Citron... THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT

Goddamn you clowns.  Stay the fuck away from SOLO unless you buy and sell it within only a few hours.  You will lose ALL.  Fucking now has a market cap over $1B based on only about roughly $1M in revenue, increasing losses, and no profits  No one is gonna buy that tripod clowncar.  This shit is radioactive waste riding fuggin' stupid meme power. Its like buying pet rocks and thinking it is a good idea.
[removed]
LOL at anyone who bought SOLO today at +30%
Not this shit again
PTON!!
it fucked me harder than fuck could be, which is why i’m now proceeding to fuck myself really hard till something erupts, then i’ll sell
Gay bears entering like SPY is down 10% when only down at .25%. Yall are really starved and like losing money.
Lmao I love this
Used SOLO profits to short them. I love wallstreet lmao
I'm also from Texas.  They're all made in China.
this is where I am too but I fucked this up by not taking enough when it was up at 135 so don't listen to me
Pton and baba calls bringing my ira back to life
What was the interest rate on the loan?
PLS corsair, just go down so I don't feel as bad for selling you . I'll buy you on monday. Pls
Told myself I was done with options and here I am down 30% on GME 13c 11/27
Oh damn yo its not that serious lol

I spend more than $20 on reeces peanut butter cups on the weekend lolol

good luck to you though
Same. bought at 7. Sold $9 calls for $100 a pop. I thought i was so smart...
You didn’t decide to make money the whole market went up double digits. If you didn’t make money you are truly retarted
Buy that SOLO dip
Lol CITRON is so fucking annoying. Just let people make money Jesus christ
[removed]
Feels like there's nothing safe to buy into right now
broke
Big 3m PLTR DP buy @18.95
This reward is fitting
Didn’t sell low. But lower than when I bought, yes.
Yeah exactly what I did, sooo gay
Up 5% so far!
EITHER MOON OR DOOM I HATE IN BETWEEN, MR. SPY
totally this. zoom EASILY going to 500 by EOY and very possibly into the 600-700 range. you saw how fast it has the potential to move the last time we shutdown.
Feels like no one talks about SPY anymore
This is fucking great
Are my 11/20 12c going to print today or am I going to be fucked as I'm just watching it drop
[removed]
Congratulations. Most of us probably could have made that and more if we had $1m to play with.
Well you can convert to shares if the price is above break even and hold long, they have a decent model for the cheapies who want EVs
I’m Jewish. We’ve been doing that for millennia.
I bought a 1DTE 13c yesterday for .26, sold it this morning for .52.  Probably my best call purchase to date (I usually play theta gang); I too am waiting on the squeeze.

Good luck OP.
Apple and Amazon haven’t really moved in weeks. What sell off?
Pulled out alot this week just to do that.
SOLO has breathed life back into my account
NIO, your brother XPEV is better than you. You're going to stay with your mom.

I think you might as well light your money on fire.
Yes.  These weekend warriors also got assigned physical delivery of thousands of barrels of crude they had no way of receiving.  I read an article about a dude who's online broker just didn't show values below 0 so when contracts hit 0 he thought 'what do I have to lose?'  1 hour later contracts are at -$42 per barrel lmao.  
  
Lots of futures contracts are cash settled but with crude you are obligated to take delivery.  
  
It's absolutely hilarious.
I'm from Texas and never heard of it
Citron says solo to $2
Hell yeah. I actually caught that one on their last earnings call.
Been waiting for the post, dudes an absolute legend. Look forward to the next one bro you’re on another level.
They have negative earnings in 2020(9 months ending), 2019 and 2018 so not sure what you’re reading
Right as my $15 calls I bought before it dived down, wonderful
Got so many salty downvotes when I warned people before the dump. Guess I’ll let the meme stockholders hold bags without warning next time lol
Buy high, sell low.
Nice. Same
Yeah, it’s a healthy red day
Lmfao
Is today the first time you’ve seen green?
LMAO. BA, dump was predictable as my morning dump. Thanks for buying those spreads.
did it really fly though? from 15.80 to 19.66 high this week

i have shares so I believe but this may have been overhyped
fuck wanted to short solo as I sold my calls at 13.40s :( wasn't quick enough, then decided not to fomo into the plunge... regret not doing it now lol
lmaooo
Zillow $120 some whale has to be finishing their DD right now and figuring out this is going to 200 next year
Diamond hands on this SOLO dip
its severely undervalued at 3.7bn, its one of the few that i‘m confident to hold even when it pumped 30% in a week, looking to exit at around 6-7.5bn

Will do- hope you make money.
NVDA
When are you guys pulling out of ccl puts? I have a bad feeling that there's gonna be some vaccine update this weekend that's gonna shoot the stock up again
SOLO. SOLO SOLO. its at a discount now. Will hit 15 EOD and 20 by next week. people selling now cause one sell makes everyone sell meaning more to average up.
Inshallah 🙏 💎🙌
I know there are retards here who went all in on solo at 13 hahahaha

I did not haha. I honestly believe it will get over 90 sometime in December.
Good move long term
Of course BABA taking off. Thank me for selling earlier

Not for months to the general population and just because there’s a vaccine not everyone will take it right away

Says the gay bear. Bet you're still worried that SPY will be green EOD.
I got 99 problems but losing money ain’t one
12/18 here
got out of solo after that tweet still have leaps tho
Just let me break even on my all time and I promise I’ll stop playing this game 😭😭
Yeah it's the punchline the comedian uses in the UTZ ad. He then proceeds to roast the company owner's fat wife, it was quite a storyline. If you haven't watched it you definitely should, best show I've ever seen by a long shot.
not really. tesla is just as much FOMO and overvalued. the car market in itself will probably not grow like crazy and the biggest car makers in the world sell around 10 millions cars a year but their market cap is much lower. volkswagen is closer to NIO. So tesla needs to sell like 40 million cars a year to justify the market cap. Thats as much of crazy bet as some EV startup making it big
Ouch
hahaha
That’s fuck you kinda money
earnings was last friday lol
Gtfo of wsb unless ur at least %10 OTM on weekly calls gaylord

SOLO into FUV it is
Sounds bullish to me
Gay soros
I might be misunderstanding what your saying here, but OP is talking about selling puts, not buying them
hope you get back in when its under 19-20. im thinking today is the last chance to get in under 19-20 before it goes to the moon next week and stays in the 20's with a climb to 30-35 over the winter. big drop and selloff will happen in the spring or summer next year when the stock hits around 35-40 and people investments start to double. people want to take some profit home usually around the doubling point. and since the stock really got popular around 15-18 a share, my guess is it will hit 30-35 then drop hard due to all the profit grabbing to 25-30, then people will see a low spot to buy in and the stock will rocketship up to 40-50 in a matter of days and hover there for a long while like TSLA did until it makes a break out into the hundreds.
DNK is going crazy! Best stock under $5 throw it a few bucks
Are my PLTR December 11 20c gonna print?
Tesla was always going to be suppressed today with options expiring. I do expect next week to resume ascent to $550
WDAY is down 7% today.  Beat earnings but down on guidance.  I'm on the fence about buying the dip.  What do you think?
People thinking that cruises will come back within a year with testing and vaccine.
Hope so!  If it was Cohen, he has until next Friday to file an amendment to his 13D.  If he did start buying, the stock is going to run to near 20 within a few days of the announcement imo

I don’t understand the zoom phenomenon during the pandemic.  It’s like they are the only ones who have this tech yet its been around and very widely deployed in corporate America for decades.  

Ive been in software/saas sales for many years and have sold web conferencing software, directly competing against Webex, Microsoft, IBM, etc.  Every company with dispersed employees owns some flavor of it already, almost all own Microsoft via the Office licensing.  

Idk maybe zoom is more consumer orientated and the others built for business?  🤷 

Also...WFH isn’t a new concept and I’m baffled that the pandemic has made it seem like this is a novel/new idea.  My company has been WFH for 20 years now.

Who also bought solo puts at the top 💀
You can start with a small position. That’s what I always do, I’m a new grad so also not exactly cash flush, so I start with 3-10 shares to begin with and then increase as I see fit depending on what I think the company growth/outlook looks like. That’s what I did with NIO and I’ve just kept buying more. My average share price is still just $38 and I first bought in at $26
Citron did solo call holders dirty ha

Oh that's what im waiting for! Should be great
these quick $1 drops on SPY would be worrying if I wasn't holding puts
Let me say that I don't believe this speculation is true.   But I am surprised that I haven't seen anyone posting the rumor that BRK bought 50MM TSLA shares.  If it were true, it would be an explosion.

You’re a fuckin wizard
There is a dip right now! As long as you get stuff with a long time to expiration, it'll still print even if it goes down in the short term
I felt the same way about buyers this week.🤷‍♂️Luckily got out with some extra funds yesterday. GL, M8.
I’ll give you a shoulder to cry on
SOLO you forgot your 🪂
Hopefully shares and not calls

Hasn't the same thing happened with PLTR every day this week? Big jump premarket, then sell off, then small climb up in the AM, the afternoon the SP drops about 50/60 cents, then finishes AH or close to it
CRSR is still good. It's cheaper to build your own and too easy with the tens of thousands of videos breaking down how simple it [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lmfF0k2UcU) (that shit never gets old). 

Oh shit, just noticed he's got corsair components. 

Probably be rolling nationwide lockdowns (esp when Biden steps in). Businesses that can will continue to allow remote work. Vaccine will drop but we as a nation probably won't be fully inoculated until next fall. 

It's a solid company with more assets than liabilities, recent acquisitions and an eye towards more. Are they top of the line components? No. Are they bottom of the barrel shit components? No. They are mid-end and affordable. As a builder on a budget I want most bang for my buck going towards GPU and CPU. 

Corsair fits that happy middle ground of not costing the most by being the best but I don't have to worry about frying my shit.

The real $TSLA FOMO boys are investing into the countless number of electric startups that are hoping to become the next Tesla. They can't become the next Tesla. You really think these small companies that haven't been able to manufacture 1,000 cars are gonna compete with automobile giants? As electric begins to grow demand, you'll see the top companies like Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota, Nissan start to increase their output of BEVs. There's more to putting a car on the road than just saying "ZERO EMISSIONS" and poof you're now auto manufacturer. Tesla is the leading innovator in batteries/BEVs and that won't be taken away. If you have $TSLA FOMO, I'd recommend investing into Ford or other companies that have already developed EVs, and have capital to build mass-produced EVs. It's one thing to develop an EV, its another to actually sell enough cars to turn out a profit. Most of these EV companies you see will fail within 2 years.
Happy cake day, but it's not looking great. It's Friday and they've been up all week, time to come back down

Yea I’m also in CRSR but a much smaller position and I think I’m going to increase it. My friend has bought just over a 100 shares in PLTR, I’m about drop a £1000 on it as well so at least if it falls, I’m coming down with you! It’s really up to you, all these are risks unless it’s Apple or Amazon
BALY wow
SOLO and FUV stock 95% made of meth at this point
PLTR done for awhile?
If you haven’t learned to load the PLTR dip by now I don’t know what the fuck to tell you
It’s because I bought puts.
It's because we're all retards who bought at the top 😞

I think it's MSFT that will kill ZM. The rise of Teams (shit though it is) for business is inevitable. Their business integration and package pricing is too good.

lemme be right once please
because a real vaccine won’t release for a long ass time, it’s a bull trap to keep the market pumped. You can’t prove a 95% effective vaccine. On top of that, it takes a year of trials to see minimal side effects and a lifetime to see overall side effects of a vaccine. 1900s they released a vaccine that had messed up side effects.
Sir. I admire your balls.

Solo puts
About to go all cash
The best thing would be for AAPL to go under $100 so it attracts new buyers. Also because I am so bored with it.
Absolutely. The crash will be very hard, and tons will lose their shirts. the valuations are stupid AF. SOLO now valued over $1B based on increasing losses, no profits, and only about $1M revenue? lol. Nio worth more than BMW even though BMW sells 500K cars per quarter in China, has double digit growth in China, and has billions in profits while NIO makes no money and sells a fraction of cars that BMW does? Utterly retarded. People are going to lose a fuck ton when the market gets bored of EVs and moves on. Same shit as HTZ, block chain, weed stocks...dumbass meme crap always blows up. Toyota, GM and the rest of the big boys have the best engineers in the world and are going to have EVs. You think these dinky little companies are going to be easily allowed to take market share from the big players? lol. Wait until Toyota blows away the competition with their solid state battery tech that will be unveiled during the Olympics
Buying vaccine calls or stocks during a pandemic??!!? Never thought of that

Here's the issue with this. Let's say this shit runs from 100 to 1000 then back to 200.

First, you're only gonna catch on when the price is already at 400. By the time you get FOMO and start buying price is at 600. Now you're thinking wait if I bought at 100 I would've made 600% already, odds of you selling ATH or slightly before are so fucked. 

The smart cookies are the people who bought this shit at 100-200. The people buying at later stages are the greedy retards who get duped. 

The only people who make serious money out of bubbles are frontrunners, HFT firms and a couple of lucky gamblers

Henrik Fisker stomped on my children’s testicles
It is a Chinese Airbnb/weWork company designed to help Chinese millennials rent apartment rooms. The users get their own room, but share the living space. This allows these millennials to save money faster and get their own place faster in China. This app is in over 37 tier 1/ tier 2 Chinese Cities and is a big player. It did a SPOC during Trumps presidency and got slaughtered due to its origin. However, recently big Chinese tech is considering to buy all the stock and own this company all out since it fell over 90% post ipo. IN SHORT PEOPLE SENSE VALUE & getting in under $5 is a nice/solid gamble on this stock. Over $5 gets a little riskier.

I think the EV market, in general across the board, has a lot of tailwind going for it in China. The Chinese government has their grandiose plan to outlaw traditional gas autos and go full hydrogen and electric. In other words, they're going to make it illegal to even own or manufacture gas vehicles lol. I think that's what's driving a lot of this shift and focus on EVs over there. Even their public buses are going full EV. BYD (BYDDY/BYDDF), Buffett and Munger's EV investment in China, has been on a tear lately. On top of that, China's got a population 4x the size of the US. Part of why Tesla is doing so well is cause of their exposure to China. Dan Ives and Cathie Woods keep talking about Tesla's China market as part of the Tesla story. And remember, China's done with Corona. There's no zoom meetings there. People are out and about because the government took the virus seriously. So I think the bull run for China just started. Anyway, just my opinion. But look into Berkshire's, Bridgewater's, Blackrock and Blackstone's exposure to China. They've invested so much in there. They're partly the reason why I feel comfortable parking a portion of my money there. Hope that gives you some ideas and confidence.
at this point the stock market is an inverse of what i do. im probably going to sell, so everyone else buy calls

Right, so they have limited their market to rich assholes, who they still have to convince to buy a Hummer EV over dozens of other options (Teslas, Mercedes, BMWs, Lincolns, Audis, high-end trucks like the raptor and t-rex, etc., etc.).    


If your costs are low enough, you do not need to sell as many 6 figure vehicles to be profitable, but EV's are also more expensive to make and more expensive from an R&D perspective.  Additionally, Hummer does not even have a loyal customer base that can afford a 6 figure vehicle like Mercedes or BMW.  Anything can happen, but this is my argument why it is going to fail.
This is fuckin terrible. 
A lot of people have options expiring today.
Plus draftkings does have a physical book in atlantic city. If they were to partner with someone like wynne, and get a foothold on the strip, it'll take off. Definitely possible.

PLTR said “I gave you a chance at 19.60 to get out even you fucking retard”
I had solo @ 1.39 and sold @ 1.40 lmao
Bought 4 calls during the dip. Trying to make up for my paper hands this week.

Here's my most basic gut reasoning for them: Intel holds 10% of institutional shares. Everything else is based on their news releases this year and the hidden tidbits of whats to come in their 20-F filing. Its going to be a 10x play at least, from $1 to $10, and they will still only be at $250m market cap.
True, got that silver lining
solo market cap has so much room to grow <3

And I absolutely agree it’s worth more
Retards mistook a two month old post for a recent news release.
So why the volatility all of a sudden?
I’m not touching Solo or FUV with a ten foot pole at this point
Should I hold my PLTR 11/27 17c?
PLTR
Ayro is only 200M market cap, can still go up. solo is already at 1B
Probably December
I’ll make it simple. I saw NIO at $11 per share. The 13c 2021 Jan 15 LEAPS were $200 per contract. You spent $3885 for 210 shares. If I would’ve spent 3885 on those leaps that would have gotten me 19 contracts (13c 2021 Jan). Now those are worth 3800 per contract. 19x3800 = 72k.

If I would’ve spent 3885 on shares, that would’ve gotten me 353 shares (rounded). Now if NIO is at $50 that would equal a worth of 17k.

Cliffs: 

Don’t be a cuck
Maybe they will be better after the merger.


....nah.
Have about 20 contracts of various strikes for February 2021

Mine is 1 call 450 exp 3/19/2021. But i have been holding this since this Monday which was right before theys announce s&p 500 inclusion. (Yeah i got super lucky). Today is down but im holding it. Normally there is huge run ip until s&p inclusion happens, which is 12/21. So im at least holding this until end of november or first week of dec. godspeed retard. Believe in papa Elon

Dude dont go down the rabbit hole thinking like this. You bought shares and are up 150%, congrats! 

You invested a decent amount of money into a stock that could have gone up, down, or sideways. Your options could have easily expired worthless with all of your money gone, you cant predict the future.

It's so easy to look back and say ohh many if only I would have bought this instead of that... its a waste of time and probably unhealthy

Anyways, what’s the next yolo
Pfizer could get FDA approved early next week
Expiration is a month out for them. I'm just hoping they crash over the weekend and I can take my
Profits Monday
PLTR
I say the exact same thing almost every fucking day
Not disagreeing with you but I'd buy puts dated a month out at least. It tends to trade high for a few weeks after a large pump
But solo dip for easy money
I'm in these too.  I also grabbed some feb 290s
😭😭
GME don't let the shorts win!
I've been watching MAXN too, also RUN and SPWR
I’ll take yours if you don’t want it

CRSR just hit 40 wtf. Buy any and all dips, this shit is straight 🚀
But when it does, it is going to get wrecked.
Much sooner it looks like. ;)
Who the hell is PENN and CZR? Lol no names compared to DKNG

Bears this is your final chance to cut your losses before we moon at power hour
as a NIO investor, 10%+ on reveal day on XPEV shows good sign for NIO day.
baba didn't dump with that. take me to vahalla jacky
This market is fake and gay and artificially propped up on stimulus hopes but damn. I just gotta play the hand I keep being given. Probably will load up on calls eod bc we'll get another vaccine and stimulus pump next week.
I guess we gonna get delisted lmao

Eh I did this last week and I am 10% up currently, take heart my dude

Lmfao
I literally never buy FD's, but this morning on the PTON dip I almost bought some 105c. 

Ended up having to buy 1 month 120c's instead. Should've trusted my gut.
We squeezin'
>redditor for 4 months

Congrats on joining the sub
Do you have a link to this patent news?
Im very bullish on it. So I’d say as much as you can afford and just hold them. I only have 24 shares and I was buying them back when they IPO’d at around $10. I’ll be buying more very soon
Die SOLO Trash.

I'll keep repeating this for those in the back: street-level research since i Live in the PNW, they were opening up a location near me so I went to go check it out figuring it was gonna be some fancy store-front or lot with vehicles you can test drive in Portland (urban center is their target market)... the day came for their spot to open and it turns out they had leased a KIOSK spot in a mall outside the city. In front of a nordstrom. Super unprofessional, shitty 0-60 in 10 second enclosed motorcycles.
We squeezin'
Let’s just say don’t try to exist the highway while watching a high liquidity option go up and down
slide right and fuck us all, except theta gang.  F theta gang, nobody likes you.
I'm not keen on upwork.
Thoughts on holding? I have calls through 12/11, trying to decide if I lock in tendies or tell my children I gambled away their Christmas present money
Fighting OTM options so they expire worthless today, and making Theta on the long term shit.   Rigged AF.
Think im gonna put a lot into 2/19 BABA calls sometime today
Don’t go crazy, the stock moves slowly
[deleted]
Lol idk. It seems kind of odd to eat dinner with other people in zoom. Really awkward.
DRAFTKINGS is going to offer better bonuses to match competition, obviously. And they don’t even need to have brick and mortar. They’re easially the most well known online betting site
Not even lol I just kept reinvesting in 11/20 c then today it caught up to me
Fuck you VTRS
It’s not yoloing when it’s itm
But TSLA is cheap now
Everyone drop your most hated stock of 2020:
what about shares
WHERE ARE MY ROBLOXERS WHOS READY FOR THIS IPO REEEE
You realize you’re preaching a mythos right? 2 of 4 days this week ended redder than they opened. This slow melt up I always hear about just isn’t true. In fact, historically (and even the past few weeks), gains happen over night and then bleed all day.
Chances of spy gapping up on Monday?
BA as in boeing.... i have BABA 300, so this has to be a good sign!
but EFFICIENCY
\+17% on the week, yep makes sense
The entire country is on the verge of shutting down again lol. I want it to die too and it will eventually and fucking epically but this is not the time.
I want a refund on PLTR
You are so fucked if you do those puts. Please lock them in asap.
Tsla bottom
NIO
I drive for DD. Tip your driver's, and you'll get good service.
Buy under $18 tbh, there will be heaps of time
Same here, wanted to buy a few dips and TD brokerage is down. For a massive company their services go down an awful lot.
Get in here
Fucking TD Webbroker is down
Yeah I got a few shares at the month's low so I'm chillin
Thats a deep sac if ive seen one
look at the 3 month chart for SPCE - it's primed for the next leg down. get in.
Loading up on some 22.5Cs right fuckin now
Alright what’s the play
i think you mean casino
PLTR almost got me with the double bull trap at open but ya ending the day flat like I thought. The correct play was to not make one.
You're in the wrong place for ethics
About to jump to light speed
For all the pltr, tsla appl posts it's a combination of profit taking from weekly swing traders, selling so close to itm calls don't go itm and generally no holding over the weekend.
SOLO 15 EOD??
Getting close to or past 20

If someone bought then someone sold
Congrats and fuck you. Never would have thought it would boom 100 percent in a week.

If NVDA keep on dropping like this I may be forced to YOLO retard money into 11/27 ITM calls

agreed! the $50 is teasing it. Once it sustains above that, it's game over. XPEV going like 11% today while NIO at 4% is testing this resistance line like a fucking cocktease
I don’t think it’s because people believe in solo, I just think it’s fomo to find the next EV stock for 200%+ gains
ew is that light mode??
You’re way too early retard. And being early is worse than being wrong.

Take your retardation somewhere else or show us some of that future loss porn. The Big Short isn’t about people who shorted the market with $350 and a McDonald’s coupon

Corsair is a great company. They will be profitable for a long time. It’s a safe stock to invest in for sure.

I might have actually timed something right. Bough solo puts when it was at $13.05

I would recommend.
Is solo going to pull a NIO and go to 35?
Sell my xpng calls or no?
Good thing I sold my Square calls yesterday, my account wouldn’t know what to do if it had actually made money
I’m new to options but what is a good position for a call on ayro. for example: 7.5 call?
Good luck soldier

Look at their revenue , earnings and compare it to their market cap. Lots of room for growth. Their Q4 numbers will be great most likely due to Black Friday, Christmas etc. 
I compare them to a company like Logitech
FUV dipped, I FOMO'd
What the fuck just happened
Yeah, I bought in October when 87 wasn’t that far otm
I am not referring to you and I obviously.
SOLO is the most retarded thing I have ever seen
Idk, but I want that cake. How do I get that cake?
You’d be a millionaire if you bought options. Good job buying shares you cuck
Red candles much bigger than green candles imo
I enjoyed this joke more than I had anticipated 😂
Am I misreading? Is NIO flashing a buy signal?

Has anyone actually seen the car that SOLO is producing? It’s an actual short bus how tf is anyone investing in that shit
college is overrated, its just a marxist indoctrination camp these days. Its better to know that the machines will look upon your line with mercy and make sure their dicks are constantly sucked by 10/10s and are fed digital fillet minions every day in the matrix.

Xpev share price is higher than NIO right now if you want to make the switch.
monday i was in Dallas Intl.  At least half of the people in there wearing no mask or a chin diaper.    Once you get on the plane, absolutely enforced, but in the terminals, not many at all wearing them.   I'd say Tampa was slightly worse, BWI was pretty good, CHI/ORD was pretty good.   

As far as cities, Dallas downtown was pretty bad.  Signs up telling people to wear masks, but not enforced at all.  Hotels seemed to be more stringent.  In Tampa/Sarasota, I was usually the oddball wearing a mask when walking into a restaurant.  

In Downtown Chicago, I'd say about half of the people I came across were wearing masks initially, however, they still wanted to have traditional hand-shakes and once in a meeting room or similar, masks off.

i guess BABA is back!

At least break ATH
If you hold XPEV, LI, NIO and SOLO you will have so much money

If it closes flat or red, 10 bagger

You never exercise options why don’t you noobs get this. Count the numbers. Notice how the option is worth more than you would make exercising it?

That’s the value of theta or time. But you impatient retards didn’t bother spending 5 minutes watching 1 of the 100 options guides that explain how options work.

At this point you’ve earned the right to force me to consider it. I’ll probably go way lighter than you, but will watch with great interest.
Said no one ever
> Yet, Nio’s stock dropped after the earnings release.

Isn't this the first time ever that NIO *hasn't* massively dumped after earnings? It was actually relatively stable this time.
After your 30 minutes of cardio 5x per week.
No it isn't that was a lie
Rumors about TTNP being acquired in the near future, part of what kicked off this surge. Any viability to that?
They can just film it rolling down a hill too.
Woke up on the right side of the bed today. Start funding that Long Term Portfolio and retire of it. I had a chance to buy Tsla at $200 pre split , NVDA at $250, SHOP at $200 sure hurts as fuck not investing the 10k i have lost in options on Long term Shares

I always fucking lose. It’s like I’m cursed in stocks. Every single thing I do is wrong. I’m so over it. I just need enough to leave.
I doubt it. It’s tied to a surging EV market.
Congrats dude. Read the 20-F for BRQS, people are shitting on the company because they cant find financials on it. the 20-F has gems in it.

Didn't this company make a total of 32 cars last quarter? And is trading at like 100x?
Bought and sold in the last thirty minutes. About +$2 per share
Dude I sold last night AH at 9.50 got in at 6.39... seriously so hurt.. this could’ve been my breaking point on quitting my job
If pltr is down on a good day it's gonna tank hard soon when we have a red day
Sometimes, I only buy AMD when it's less than 80 and sell above 83
EV market is literally dotcom bubble but its only the beginning so we will see NIO at 150bn and SOLO at 30bn before the crash
not at all, still under the 200 day ma
I mean, BABA clearly has more growth potential than AMZN
Nio is a buy here. $53 eod
Pssst... I've got some KNDI in my van, come check it out. It's supposed to be $14 EOD
I laughed way too hard at this
Glad I could help :) BRQS is my next play, moved some profits into there.
Lol that PLTR guy must have gave up trying to pump his shit stock
If I am on the spectrum but also a retard...  


Does that make me autarded ?
It is a rule that I must share that FUBO has been ripping and it is at ATH which makes it a perfect time for everyone to pile in with calls
For which ticker
I looked at calls first thing this morning but didnt pull the trigger, wish i wouldve. I know its a pump n dump but id like a little action
Higher highs, higher lows. $360 SPY EOD pls
Yea. Chegg sucks. I got a 74 on my final copying and pasting. And for that reason. I’m out
It’s like half a car they made the front half and just stopped there.
Good job puss puss. Now get 300 percent gainz today
dude, you're fucking brainwashed

WTF even is this???
**GDRX** , $40 eod
Who knows? Maybe it'll be market crash Monday?
Ah sick didn’t see that one when I commented earlier
DKNG isn't unique
this is only showing nasdaq though
When is SOLO peaking? Everyone seems to be able to agree when to dip and leave me holding the bag
Tesla 11/27 420p
Well that’s a promising outlook, but I agree
No. But starlink? It’s possible.
SOLO reminds me of a modernized BMW Isetta needs more front door then i'd be sold

I mean.... you're right though, but its going to take big money to leave to come down drastically. I see a repeat of last year after January 20th though.
TSLA 490 support
higher lows and higher highs.
It's going to pop and go on sale for the rest of the year, gotta get it into the funds by the end of the year. Just buy longer out on the dips
It would be pretty silly if I YOLOd 20k on NKLA 40c weeklies because someone wrote a post about it and I just realized it was labeled satire, right? $rope

I dont see any affordable FREE leaps, not sure its likely to see its pre-covid high of $10+ even by april of next year, and even those are priced above other investment plays with more movement. Just my 2c. As for UTZ i cant even guess whats going on
Yeah this why I’m in
I somehow managed to lose money today just... wow.

It would need to hit the 30s to match SOLOs cap.
She gets around, yes
Thee ni🅱️🅱️as caint stop me (no)


so they try to copy 🙅🏾‍♂️


buy NIO at the toppy (sloppy)


Hit the trade and then it droppy 📉 (Drop drop)
hell if that’s the case i’m going to pack up and leave with my 30% increase today 😂
Nah

Why would there be a peaceful transfer of power when the election is disputed and the votes aren't certified. Maybe you should do some research on how elections work in the U.S. before getting all nutty. When the electors vote and congress counts the vote and declares the president-elect then we will know who will be president. This is the way it has always been. This time we have a propaganda media blasting mis-information too a bunch of low-information voters that know next to nothing about how elections work. Then we end up with a bunch of people like you spewing nonsense because 'ThE tV sAiD sO'. Same with your Russian hoax when all along it was your own candidate that was selling out Americans for personal gains with Russia and China. The media really hurt our future and you are a prime example of how.
Only goes up
This is exactly how it works

Yes- BABA is the way
That’s what everyone said about smart cars too

This is the way.
Yup you're correct. Just closed it.
solo puts lol!
BALY mooning
Check out r/tressless, you can find more there.
What positions? Do you have 300c or just some 270c that you’ll hold until 300
NIO and XPEV
walk up there and cough.
im staying in SOLO till 12/17   
only regret is not buying more😌
If you sell your option/stock for a profit. Do you wait for a pullback to play that same stock on the dip or move on to new stocks?
Would if I could, am in the UK and every broker rinses you
my brain just broke
Solo bouta be ded
but if im making money, somebody is losing money so its a zero sum game so therefore Im at least smarter than 51% of the people investing
Life is so easy,  
Until theres any kind of significant movement.  
And then you get gangbanged with no lube.
I thought the lockup was expiring March 2021 - is it December?
Until it isnt

No . He knows he’s an asshole and hes waiting for someone to call him out on it. Don’t risk it . Move away from him
What did you enter in
I had 150 shares at 6.70 cost basis that I sold at break even earlier this week. The more I looked at the company (and the car), the more I couldn't take it seriously and thought no way that POS could take off. Joke's on me I guess.
What is Tesla bottom so I can go all in?
**GDRX**  is not going anywhere, they also do tele health
It's a Fake News
You put a 'k' after 1800, so people thought 1800*1000.
Seriously who would buy that ugly ass car for SOLO?
People shit a brick when california passed a law requiring auto makers to sell all electeic by 2035. That means BEST CASE. In 2035 all NEW sales will be electric. So give it another 10-15 yrs before the gas cars sold in 2034 are old and make the switch. And thats just CA. The rest of the country will take longer. We got a good 20+ yrs before oil actually starts dying off and thats just auto industry not even all the other things.

Well, I think the complete opposite of us would be screaming to never buy Chinese and taking huge short positions on XPEV/NIO, haha. Thanks for the words of wisdom - it is just tempting to try to free up some positions and chase after the likes of FUV/AYRO/SOLO. EV companies are super hot right now, but I'm not quite sure if all of these smaller companies will keep growing, or where they'll end up consolidating at.   


Got any opinions on them?

Dum dum, I don't know what any of that means. You're supposed to explain it in a way an autist can understand.
The problem with calling it a bubble is that there's barely any inventory available right now.

If you have 5 houses for sale, but 700 buyers, is that a housing bubble? No, it's a lack of inventory.

In the US you have *maybe* a handful of mid-market EV options now that the Model 3 is stopping production. People are thirsty to buy EVs.

I'm currently using wealthsimple, but it doesn't have any options trading, just stock buying.
(Cue Yoda voice) That is why you fail.
Id love a bit more info, when, where. Your positions
Daddy chill
I keep saying don’t buy solo cuz when you do it’ll dip but I’ve also been saying that since it was $6 a few days ago literally doubled in 2 days
that just gives me more of a reason to buy ayro
NIO is sleepy
Well shit most went parabolic rn, KNDI is on a dip so maybe them?
PLTR is gonna trade flat most the day maybe will pump slightly EOD closed my positions this morning
If PLTR could get back to 19.58+ that would be great.

have you ever learned anything? its never too late.
i was gonna buy at $3 a few weeks ago and passed for PLTR

I would appreciate it if you sold ?
I need a yolo 0dte  fd play to make. Any suggestions?
I feel so much worse about my calls now that I bought today, thanks
Congrats on u mofo's killing it with solo
Anybody else buying TSLA every friday? It's basically free money every weekend
bruh make sure your arbitrage is on point so your hedge can have optimal risk loss with ... fuck it, trade on!!!!
Theta gang, whats the play
yup
Positions or ban
PLTR knights, the battle at $18 was hard but we WON. Hang in there, we will win $19!!!

What I'm really saying is convert those call gains to shares and start selling covered calls until mid December when lockup expires, then buy the dip.
0-60 in 10sec. They are literally go karts
Right, we're expecting it to return to $8.
I don’t have fun unless I’m holding a weekly

I mean it's up another 5% today, it was 7% at one point. I cashed out, but the gains are there to be had
Anyone buying FUV puts or just me?
That's the spirit! Now back to the bottom
No one feels bad for you meth head
options aren't available yet though
Not much of a boast my friend, it's currently at $13.
Oh ok - that must be why I'm outperforming SPY every month this year
OMG TSLA AT LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE...

fucking yesterday. Relax.
Unreal!!!
Fuck it, sell your kids and put that money in too
You were definitely right.
Yup, great song
Buying calls EOD
Nio pls run into 50s
Technically secks
Next week will be super low volume because of thanksgiving.
Puts, Calls, they all seem PERFECT at the time...probably the worst expired shit I've ever done
Hcac
Looks like that'll only net \~37k if it hits 4000 --- not *that* confident it'll hit more than 3500. Hmmm.
That's what happens when you do a reverse split at an all time high.
Me out here putting the derr in derivatives trading
Every shit EV company getting pumped. Just take a look at SOLO. I’m staying away.
ROKU setting up for a run to 300.
Sold my 6.50 calls yesterday when it hit 8.60. Pain
Just remember what IV crush is and you're good to go
SPY down, PLTR down.

SPY up, PLTR down and flat.
there are like 300,000 idiots born every day.   Some buy clown cars, some trade on wsb.  Never underestimate stupid.
Damn I felt that.
people were saying exactly this about asia and especially china; this isn't close to the most important part of the issue. if anything underdevelopment is a tailwind historically in that you skip right over desktop, credit cards into mobile and payments, and for delivery the presence of vibrant small to medium businesses is a massive boon.
No amount of money and no positions. BAN
That would be a super super accurate clock, like atomic clock accurate. It just has the wrong time , definitely not broken. The opposite of broken in fact. Its like if an atomic clock hadn’t adjusted for the clocks going forward an hour, is it really broken?
Turns out 2000\~2002 was not a bubble. It's just a healthy pullback. 

Stocks go up in the long run.
Shares? Definitely hold
hard pass on that SOLO IV.
Was just gonna put them into PLTR shares as I can see bigger growth there and then get back into AAPL later
Y’all over here sleeping on FUV. 30% swing today
China is winning today.  Hold.
Yolo’d on TSLA calls. Beans and rice for the next, idk, 30 years or so?

Easily, look at the chart in the past it’s went from 266 to 300 in like a week

it’s literally a tricycle

holy shit keep going down TSLA save my poots!
GET UNDER $5, it’s still under valued (gives you at least 20% up side). It was a $10 spoc that got killed because it was a Chinese company during the Trump Presidency. I think the company is honestly worth $5. At $5 YOU should make the decision if you wanna hold longer or sell. Until enjoy the dip, FYI it fell 32% yesterday from 4.45 to 3.5. A lot of people bought the dip from the YouTube channel I follow on this stock.
How???? Which strike and date?
[deleted]
These literal vertical lines with +100% increase in 2 days with these meme EV stocks are fucking hilarious. Shame I missed SOLO AYGO RIDE pretty much all other than nio
At the end of the day, I got out with a 5% gain, but it would've been easy to get 7% if you sold at its peak. I think this stock is going places, but idk if I can stay in when I get a tidy 5% profit that quickly
I'm balls deep.

Haven't sold shit, buy every dip.
what
PLTR what happened to that big dick energy
Apple The last 5 days has had 391 million more shares to the sell side then buy side
Depends, how 🌈 you feeling today? If you’re craving a fat 🍆 In your bum you should go with puts
Thinking the same thing
What's peak autism is that NKLA is still 10B even though it has $30k in revenues from a completely unrelated business. Trevor milton truly has the gift of the gab.

You in the wrong stocks bruh
Or they are pumping for an EOD dump.

Lmao APPS what the actual fuck
Lol it doesnt matter itll be at 540 regardless. Plus it doesnt count unless you sell. If you have 10 shares of tsla and it goes to 390 on friday but on monday it goes to 600 it still money out in the market it only counts if u sell. Plus its tsla its bound to go back up and they valued tsla at 540 anyways.
Position or ban
It’s gonna get pinned there I would close and weekly positions MM’s are trying to keep it suck at $19

they have 2+ billion in pre-orders. that being said, i got out at 12.50 ish. too risky for me

their revenues for Q3 were at around $600k+, up like 1900%, and they're projecting they'll beat Q2+Q3 in Q4
Doubt it. Seems to be having a hard time with the 39.5 wall. I sold my 11/20 40c for way less than I should have because I waited so long thinking it would spike back up today and general decay. Bought a 12/18 50c because I’m an optimistic retard though
Sell my AMD or AAPL shares? Both for losses but AMD is a smaller loss?
I sold yesterday so that would make sense.
Just watched a Rey from Star Wars cosplay porn video. That shit was hot af. I think I like cosplays now.
Solo is so overvalued it’s not funny. Nobody is gonna buy that POS car. It’s a 🤡 car
I’m on CRSR with you
SOLO puts eod? like 230 or 3pm. People probably wanna take profits
Commercial utility segment. Universities,  industrial parks, food trucks, etc.
Holy shit, hope it works out.
Alright I'm balls deep in TLS lets do this boys
You do realize you can still buy on the dips and make money even though week itself is red right? Lot easier to cause usually opens red and melts up throughout day.
I did. Thanks for advice
Had bitchboy hands yesterday and sold my SOLO $7.5 call to take a small loss.  It's now $13.50+

Sell some, buy some. This is how I played NIO. Its how I'm still playing NIO.

I had a bunch of NIO 31C 01/15/21 before earnings I sold more than half and locked in around 30k. The remaining contracts I have are what I intend to ride to near expiration, and I will definitely exercise them if NIO is still killing it.

Took those profits and put them into TSLA 520C 12/04/21, sold every one of those contracts for around 30.5k, then used my profits to buy actual shares (both NIO + TSLA) 

Now I sell far OTM calls on these while also riding my other contracts, with intent to keep doing the same. 

If you believe in the company AND want to get rich, do both.
At this point VT
Holy fuk SOLO
Yes and no
H......

What is it with PLTR and 19
Solo's product is garbage. Nothing wrong with riding the wave but personally I would never commit to them long term.
i’m telling you now it’ll hit $15 either by the end of next week or the week after
Great long term hold

Newbie here and decided to be an insane fuck and and drop $1K on it (only one stock I did it) yesterday morning and I'm doing pretty well so far. Idk when I'll sale but looks promising for the next few months
That means it’s just getting started and we don’t have to worry about a pop until one of these retarded tickers gets over $100 at least.
Coz you feel generous with your profits and want to share with the rest
Yep I feel a big correction coming for it

I will by THO next time it dumps to 80

I will by THO next time it dumps to 80

I will by THO next time it dumps to 80
So we going back up soon
the fact that nio is valued at 6 million dollars per car made and SOLO is taking off which is bar none the ugliest and dorkiest "vehicle" i've ever laid eyes upon .... proves this is an EV bubble
Lost 25% in 5 minutes on Monday, new record. Now Im hopping on the CRSR and MRNA calls tendie trains 🚊
is that MSFT finally not being a POS?

NIO doesnt have a top
\*grabs crotch\* ... price this action ho!!!
VTRS dip, $20-$25 price target
Nothing just a stupid report and because its also tue weekend. Lots of investor hate holding stocks over the weekend. Thats why stocks spuke in mo ey and during the week and go down on friday and or during the weekend.

I dont blame them it happened to me with nio i held it during the weekend and it went to 41. But tsla is a different story though
I just sold actually. Might regret this hard, but it feels so fucking stupid how this shit is mooning
i have been on the right side of every trade this week. cant wait to lose it all next week!
11/10
LMAO i just googled the SOLO car. people are really wilding with this EV run right now
What would a catalyst of that magnitude look like in your opinion?
Has 6 employees, MEME
Having similar thoughts. I feel like next week may dip...
With 300k in sales and lost 9m last quarter.  If I trusted the market to not be stupid I would short the shit out of it but I could see it hitting 20 next week and puts are expensive as fuck.
Fuck, I should've bought more SOLO
Y'all already made the 22.5 December Call go up %1700 percent.
I drink to this.
It did this all day yesterday until the last hour of trading when it shot up
Casinos
AUD? lol whata joke
Gee, that's a great question. It's just the singular document that dictated the disposition of the assets underlying the derivatives that you're now asking about.

Why indeed?
Is there any reason to not just flat out buy shares for like every EV car/truck company right now? Lol
So what I eat McDonald’s while watching my $0.01 spy puts and I enjoy it 😤
i tried telling all of yall 2 days ago that tsla wil dump friday.

i hope you listened to me.

order books dont lie. There was the most calls expiring on 11/20 ive ever fucking seen.
Qqq is green and most of faang is red. Fuck this market.
Yes
TSLA 11/20 420p
Bought NIO at the top 🤡
It’s a 2 week free trial.
I've bought shares and selling calls, so far so good
I ditched the ones I was holding on Wednesday because I didn't see it getting any better. That was dumb.
Bro idc I'm not touching solo or ayro... lmao even worse than smart cars they won't be in the market for long
eye of the storm
Hand it straight to the cashier at McDonalds and place your order
How do I call calls on bankruptcy?
I was just sticking with NIO and dabbled with XPENG a month or two ago. it's been a ride no pun intended.
They expleudhede
DNK stock. Best bet right now
Buying calls cause it’s shaping up to be a big rally EOD lots of consolidation/bull flags forming rn
KNDI your are welcome to moon like the other EV stocks now
Over/under on CRSR breaking $40 today?
Electric Vehicles memeing is so reminiscent of the Weed companies meme era.
lol
They can’t cruise until spring next year and just floated a bunch of debt. Ship is sinking.
Same shit here. Brought for 200 Sold for a loss of 125 now they are worth 520
OP is so damn lazy, couldn't even check himself
TSLA - RSI OVERBOUGHT
MACD - CROSSED OVER TO DOWNTREND
Red candles forming and next support probably at 486

Not financial advice just saying ya noe
Why do they need 65%. The current votes against are not enough. Bloombergsen Investment Partners ,Madison Avenue Partners and Breach Inlet Capital investors  don't add up to enough to reject it especially if they need more than 36%.
Tell my why i should not take profit, please
I think PLUG is unrelated, more like hydrogen. BLNK is same sector though yes, but I understand Chargepoint to be the leader
Sure
have you seen their product

fuck no

I got fucked by livongo tdco merger los 2,300
Why did I sold my SBE shares at 17 and BLNK at 8.20
markets have been boring as fuck for over 2 weeks. Not like anything interesting or consequential going on or anything
Two days ago I sold a few 11/20 10C’s for $0.20 for a measly gain. They’re now worth around $9.00 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Same
Dec18 Solo puts. I just can’t fathom this EV pump wave lasting three weeks.
680c 12/4
Lmao it went from $5.5 to $6.75 the day I bought it, thought I got in way too high, and it just hasn’t stopped
You’re weong
SOLO going to take profits at one point.
FCEL buy the dip
I pump and dump cheese balls all the time
I rolled outta BLNK to sit sideways with PLTR lmao true retard here

Let's not forget KODK, eh?
What’re y’all buying puts on for the EOD dump?
No, it would be more worth it to buy shares
Price action says otherwise
ty sir. I felt that way back in 2018. I took a break and spent the next year learning all the bullshit. I don't really use technicals or use crayons but it helps to understand as much as you can.
Lol
AYRO call worked for me and got 200% ROI, I expect it to go further until bubble burst. TLS for long term growth since IPO yesterday and they’re dealing with US military which is always a gain. BQ said to burst in next year as well.
damn i bought 20 solo stock and they are printing more than my options wtf
Shout out to the guy who bought a single one of my hundreds of $11 GME Puts for $1 today.
Did FUV win the Megamillions or something?

yolo on stocktwit comments 😹
I looked at it this morning and it was clearly the one not to buy, surprised how wrong I was for today but this one won't make it
on robinhood it says this: Tuscan Holdings Corp. Common Stock, also called Tuscan Holdings, is a blank check company, which focuses in searching a target businesses in the cannabis industry. The company was founded on November 5, 2018
what i usually do is not buy too far out the money,
Yilong
solo evs are fugly as shit
I was in solo all week while it was flat. Sold my positions and went balls deep into fsr which seems to be the only ev in red
On what
What's the thesis for AYRO? EV moon meme?  
Ok let me just get in touch with my broker so I can just fucking stop asking questions and buy it.

'like many young companies, ElectraMeccanica is not profitable and likely won't be for a number of years. The little bit of revenue that ElectraMeccanica has generated - including CA$300,000 for Q32020 - has been from the production of custom-built roadsters. Nonetheless, ElectraMeccanica has increased its losses with its operating loss for the third quarter jumping to CA$8.8 million compared to CA$7.8 million during the same period last year, primarily due to the increased SG&A expenses as well as increased stock-based compensation expenses, and net loss rising to CA$14.9 million compared to CA$5.3 million in Q3 2020 due to the fair market revaluation of the company’s warrant derivative liability.'

Don't lose your tuition money on what's tantamount to the segways of cars, for a company that makes no profits, has increasing losses, and basically only has a little over 1M in revenue for an entire year.  This could turn on a dime at any moment.  Make profits and bail. 1 billion valuation for this junk? lol. this is absolutely peak autism.
E-Trade just smacked me with a 90 day trade restriction for buying with unsettled cash and then selling it before it settled.


Thanks ciic for the money and the restriction.  That account is all leaps for 2022 and psth stock so hopefully I return to gains



Now do I use my ameritrade or go make a rh and join you guys
I sold at 10 like an asshole. You’re not alone
Up 500% on my 12/18 $10c 🤑
bubble
Just saw my damn shares of tsla drop and realized its friday. The good old weekend dump. Why do people get scared of holding tsla iver the weekend. Its tsla yall are retards
BLNK PLUG are same sector yes?
Buy DNK while it’s under $5. Chinese we work company worth $5 billion.legit movement is by 100 basis points. Perfect for a swing
WHY IS SOLO STILL GOING UP AND I HAVENT BOUGHT ANY
Wouldn’t be the first time 🤡

Look at my comment’s upvotes, then look at yours. You’ll get it eventually. If not, you don’t belong here.
SOLO really went for $8 75  yesterday to $13.15 now. Im pissed I didn't buy calls....meanwhile TSLA -___-
Say it ain’t so
What’s a $400 play for guaranteed tendies?
Did TSLA ever settle to reasonable valuations? Besides maybe March which was a once in a decade event

Anyone who actually owns an EV knows that BLNK is trash and SBE is the better play.
Thoughts on PLUG?
Take your bitch home then I nut up in that pussy
Isn't NVAX a decent buy atm?
Weak ass fucking paper hands. Sold my SOLO $7.5c 11/20 for a 50% loss two days ago.
TSLA and TDOC sellers can eat my dick
Just got 10k in $380 SPY calls expiring at the end of the year for $.88

Thats a decently strong YOLO IMO
I bought SOLO and BLNK on a whim this morning 🚀
My puts hope so
Yo wtf is KNDI
[removed]
I FOMO hard into SOLO at $11.5... thank god the rocket is still going :)
I think I looked into that but I have to deposit CAD and then convert. 90% of my cash is USD so I didn’t want to lose on conversions.
I will diamond hand these calls of TSLA please?
You mean bleeding from  theta
Everyone dumping it but it will be back by EOD. Jk it’s going to 450...
GME gonna end red. Needs another miracle green candle to sustain that level. Sad really.
Pouring one out because I know someone bought TSLA 0DTEs today thinking they were going to Mars.

Drinking one for the autists who are going to buy it EOD. Because going all in on a stock that’s up 20% this week is the only legitimate start

[deleted]
Sold almost the top of my PLTR nov 20 15C , 220% feels good  😎
Anyone else feel like SBE has the most potential out of any of the EV stocks? Like SBE is the leader in the infrastructure that makes EVs even possible right? Didn’t Biden mention some EV charging station initiative?
Well damn. To each their own. Good luck if you do end up investing!
Spy put expiring in two weeks
I love it!
SOLO might be the most obvious pump and dump scheme I’ve ever seen
Is buying deep ITM call option a good strategy?
Lil pussy hasnt gone balls deep in your mom. This dude is a fake
But you’re going to keep holding them aren’t you
Solo two days ago
I just got some SPY 370c 11/27 for $0.10, similar bet

I just got back.

WHAT DID ELON DO???
BYND$ WTF REEEE
Thanks, i'm trying to avoid putting all my portfolio into PLTR and other meme stonks. Any other recommendations?
I’d be so fuckin green today if I didn’t touch Tesla ugh
GD son! Keep it up!! I've accepted the fact that options aint for me
SOLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We print it. Digitally.
[removed]
It’s ok PLTR, I didn’t want to make money today anyways 🥴
They sold around $3 since 2018, they’ll probably be available soon
Pretty happy I had some extra laying around and jumped in at $3.67. This was a real grassroots thing from BlueWhale, never put into a penny stock company like this but I guess I’m looking into Borqs because the same guy rec’d them 

Kudos brother
Need a $150 play for my small challenge account
fake news
Dec 1st is the 150 day window then 20 days after that (Dec 21st) PIPE shareholders can sell off
Solo is literally a clown car and I love it

Robinhood only crashes when I try and open the options tab on FUV. I can open options on every single stock on the app except the one losing me thousands of dollars.
SOLO puts all day long

12/18 puts
Yeesh bought solo calls for $7.5 expiring in March last week and they’re up 250% already
Still holding mine in at 6.39 now if only I didn't buy just 12 sad shares
[removed]
Oh there’s definitely people here who bought 11/20 550c at the top
I feel you
TSLA falling off a cliff, NIO gonna follow suit shortly
⚠️ IF Tsla breaks 486... its gonna be fun to watch lol
I swear everything I sell just keeps going up right after
Probably short squeeze/bubble mania

Gonna be ugly in a few mknths
Shut up Baguette!
I used to like casinos and sports books, now I come here.
Is TSLA now the boring company?
Holding SPCE leaps
Not green enough, been sitting on an 87.5 CALL forever
lottery. so much can go wrong from now to mid-january. also things return to normal = commodities goes down. things go bad and market takes a shit = commodities moves with market.
Long term they are probably good, but right now meme energy
Forget options, just buy cheap EV stocks: AYRO, KNDI, RMG, FIII.
AMD has been consolidating in this 75-90 range for a while.  I bet if this shit manages to break  90 it will absolutely FLY through 100 to 120+ like PTON did.
What is Tesla doing!?
Captain SOLO checking in for daily yahooo
Just hold it’s already worthless lol still a lot of day left.
On god
Think it could hit back up to $300 by January ?
Warning: just bought solo calls so it's going south
But what iiffffffff!!!!! Lol
It’s also on the cheap site rn
Don’t feel bad I bought one at close and sold it for a loss. Now it’s worth triple. But I’m back in it and not making that same mistake.
Real ass WSB.  All of us autists should aspire to be the only one holding a big fucking bag of gold at the end.

Good for OP.  Rooting hard for you to win this one.

(Yeah, I fucking know I'm tangentially rooting for COVID 19)
Sell now, avoid a bigger loss.
Not a bad idea. It’s a clown car company.
what's your strike?
Wow just straight down huh TSLA?
sold FUV at $10

Fuck me I sold SOLO way too early. Damn these weak hands!!

Tsla probably heading to 486 if it breaks all break loose, so you still got abit of room for puts. This is not financial advice btw its up to you atb
Did the same. Bought at 1.33 sold at 2.15. Over 3.3 right now
Congrats. Fuck you
I'd just like to point out that SOLO is now a 1 billion dollar market cap company.
Theory:

1. Buy stock
1. Stock goes up
1. Sell stock
1. Buy other stock
1. Other stock goes up too
1. Sell other stock
1. Repeat  
1.  Buy lambo


What really happens:

1. Buy stock
1. Stock goes down
1. Sell stock for a loss
1. Repeat 
1. Dinner at poorhouse
should i buy spy calls or spy puts?
My boyfriends wife is not amused
December is usually when people dump their positions so that people take losses for tax purposes. Which is why you have the January effect where people buy back positions.
Will be in play, deary me
sold fcel and wmt, got amd again and blnk
I was promised a moon mission from VTRS and now I am sad
I'm up 30k ytd starting from 250 back in Jan.
I guarantee a lot of these high flyers will be down 50% or more in a 2 year span lol

Wtf is KNDI? CIIC? No chance they keep these gains
FUV UP 400% IN A WEEK
Do it dude!!!!!
Retard.
Y’all really be practicing buy high sell low
Brooo! I remember an autist posting Naked groceries to support them in any way he could, but then talking about owning 15k shares of Naked Brand. 

Still not sure whether he was confusing the two companies or making a joke). That guy made some decent profit huh
That’s why we wear pajamas
Are these EV stocks just running on meme energy or am I missing something?
FUV TO THE MOON BABY
You thought it would be cute to dress up your kid with a meme to impress a bunch of strangers? No wonder stonks go up
wtf happened. it was a bear fiesta last night and futes was period red
What even is Solo. Is this just the EV pump wave? So tempted to sell Dec 18 $15c for $3.40.
Solo go back to 10
I'll play SPY with you
Couldn't find any news, but FSR seems more solid to me then SOLO, way better looking too.
So you’re saying it’s going back to year 2000 levels
Shorter term Dec 18 10% otm
ban
Fuck. My stop loss kicked in and my 13x500c I got for 1.50 on Tuesday sold for $2. Yesterday's high was $16. $18,850 profit vs the $650 I got instead. Take your profits gentlemen. I wish I did.
if you bought calls at the beginning of the week, you probably still lost money i'm guessing.
hopefully, you make something
GME back to $12, Time to buy FD Puts. Buying over, slow beed COMMENCE
Lil Tendie
Sell now if you’ve got profit
Why do you think this? 
PLTR seems to have a wider range of applications, TLS appears way more niche
Get your hands out of your vagina
Just got 3000 shares to the.moon this thing will hit 20$ easssyyy
Adsk gonna break out again and make me finish all up inside my jeans.
Out of XPEV calls for now. Loving this volatility and crazy action. Will wait for a dip to reenter
Price suppression is real and the worst thing about being a PM Investor.  The price to buy a generic ounce of Silver is 20% higher than the spot price. The fines assessed to JP Morgan for manipulation are paltry in comparison to the profits that they've generated.  What Silver needs is a 'fun/relevant' Billionaire Evangelist, who will call out the manipulation on CNBC + Other Media outlets - and sue the Commodity Exchanges after each batch of 'flush selling'.  For now, it's baby steps.  A climb in Silver spot price to $26, followed by a launch attempt at $30+ and beyond.  I would bet a toe, that at minimum, Silver hits $40 in 2021.  As you say, the demand for 'green energy', particularly solar, is a huge demand driver, which when paired with heavy inflation, should vault the price to ATHs.
Isnt that the guy thats drunk on TV all the tims?
nice!!! glad someone made money from GSX!
*buys the dip*

**ahem** 📢 Soooo this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, cuz we all need a little more tendies, btw your wife feels so empty without me

Damn got into solo around 6.80 sold at 8 something just to see it moon to 12 🤡
Held down on xi bullshit. Super low PE. fundamentals will prevail
What the actually hell is FUV doing
Ya got them at 495, getting throat punched
It may be the future but the valuations are absurd right now (i.e. blink running 200% in a few days). Just wait for it to settle and then buy in
DO NOT LOOK!

Ohhh hell ye it is, solo is having a huge aneurysm today
I just dug myself out of a 70% hole I’ve been in over the past months. Can’t be mad, but man it sucks knowing how much I left on the table. I’d literally be able to pay off my student loans If I held that stuff for another day or two
Thank you ... username checks out

Special kind of retard right here.
Again I didn't buy FUV calls at open....
EOD today feels like a good entry point for Tesla
All these EVs going crazy and I buy calls for CLSK
[removed]
Since 300: Oversold mainly on PRC disappearing Jack Ma or “anti trust” fears while the drafts won’t actually affect BABA’s recent record breaking bottom line and sales numbers. Jack is a figurehead and initial dip to 300 was just because Ant’s IPO is going to get rescheduled ... it’s dumped since then (and destroyed my portfolio) due to Xi apparently personally wanting to kneecap Ma, due to Ma’s arrogant (their view) comments about the limitations of China’s economic policy specifically towards banking standards and payment processing systems. Ok now give me an award. Xoxo
nope. don't have rh but nice try retard
or with the loss :(
i'm retarding sometimes. right now, i can't stop looking at my 0dte SOLO call

Pfizer is gonna get that shit through no matter what, Moderna a week behind them.

its a company that actually has sales lol
About to buy some on sale right now
Dumb
stimmy talks back on the menu
Imagine being so bad at trading you find a way to be happy about losing money
[deleted]
Which shares
I mean it just ipod lol
/s?
Why is it dipping?
Bruh wtf
My leaps thank you
Thank you for this i will hold a little longer to see if there is any reversal if not im going to pull out. It sucks to take a loss but better than $0 sometimes i bag hold but im not too sure this time. Thank you dawg youre smart.
Okay okay that was the dip to buy then...
[deleted]
Dont know. But I think thats a good thing.
Yes I know... I am home here
Nah my NIO puts are about to print
The second one but if you don’t get caught holding the bag does it really matter?
Get your spy calls now... 22% iv... $360 will be an easy hiy
yuge dip from past weeks
Slow drop down rapid dildo up
TSLA diamond hands. Next week will be glorious
Is it not still just concept?

Sell before the crash
Spy 369c 11/23 is 0.01 if we got a positive catalyst over the weekend you could make 6 figures by putting in 500

FFS SOLO, i am glad i went to make lunch before hitting the sell on my calls.
[deleted]
Solo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨
Ya I don't know whats going on but following the $ in the past has worked and going to do so again here.
Puts on your lifespan
EV charging stations. Everyone's predicting a big shift to EV manufacturing.
Might buy solo puts EOD. This is absolutely insane. Making me really regret selling my March calls. Insane
[deleted]
Not true lol. I'm down 70% ytd on RH 😭😭😭
solo fuv and blnk lol. ok.
Market trending up GG
Let's buy at the ATH
Tbh I don’t know but the ev market in China is completely protected by the Chinese government to an absurd degree basically forcing Chinese to buy Ev
ARKK making me nice tendies today
Thoughts on TLS? Thinking about grabbing 100 shares
Literally missed out on 3x-4x baggers, amounting to $20-25k. Had ETSY and W 11/27 calls. Both are up 3x-4x since I had bought them right at the bottom, but sold too soon 😔😔😔
You’re going down
Your gonna wanna sell your solo today
wow today is green as fuck, amazing
[deleted]
I posted about it yesterday actually
I’m glad I bought out of my sold $7.5 SOLO calls when it was at $10 today, good lord.
I only worship the dark lord solo
Wow I bought Tesla at the top and paper handed by SOLO calls . I quit guys fuck me
I honestly have the worst luck. Non of my orders go thru. Everything moons. Then pton goes thru and immediately tanks
so the market is FoRWaRd LuKin, but we can't price in the fact we'll have vaccines distributed as early as december and ZM moons, yeah lol 🤡
SOLO! Cleared for launch!
Is SBE dead or is their another run up coming today?
They got approval for a new treatment regimen for one of their chemo drugs + announced a COVID-19 vaccine partnership with Israel + I feel like Vaccine related stocks in general going to get little pops here and there as we go through the submission, approval, and distribution processes.  AZN hasn't released final data yet and I think people are speculating and wanting to get in on the bump like they did with PFE.
The more the fed devalues the dollar the more gold and crypt0 are worth. Bitco to 100k
Yeah back to August levels...
Pomp eet?
ya ok fuv n solo lol.
Is it safe to look at again?
Markets don’t need the Feds 🤑
Anyone have 11/27 TSLA calls?
Absolutely stoopid
PLTR is / was being held down by a 35k sell wall at $19.05 theres other ones about every .10 -.15c
Why didn't you post this 30 minutes ago?!!
Holy shit BLNK might explode lmao this is insane
Blinky!
Just got some calls
already did twice.. after a losing trade, now getting vodka + sprite.
They're full of shit.  Have used GoodRx at CVS for all kinds of controlled substances.
Stuck between good buy and goodbye
Eh I think mango is more likely to tank markets at this point. He's all about making this transition as miserable for America as possible, and he's not against lashing out at the markets for pumping in anticipation of the Biden win.

And he's definitely not going to go for any stimmy before he's evicted.
Ive definitely heard of this. I guess this is the same thing when its dumbed down to 1 sentence. I always thought that was incredibly fucked up though even though I had no power to change anything and never will haha
I sold a few days ago even lower 🤡

ITM Nio Calls after the OG OTM that gave me the initial boost. Then spread things out a bit. Now I’m all in PTON Jan 21 100/120 calls
this is a good reason. thank you maple man!
Bullish. That sounds like a company that knows exactly what it's doing.
Not by me!
it's really where all the moves are made, isn't it?  people sleep on its value.

Hello Reddit, would you like to hear about our lord and savior NIO?
I'm so excited for him to leave
[deleted]
Thousands of dollars in sales. Thousands!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guess who just woke up. NIO is getting me hard tho so
Seems like IV crush will squeeze this stock unless it makes 2-3% growth until your strike date. Risky to hold, but it could do that. Who knows.
You guys must not be making enough to get the 0dte unlock code.

pro's only. I got mine yesterday
Source for rona?
its going down
Tsla making lower highs and higher low. GG back down until the inclusion happens i guess
Cvs definely takes goodrx for adderall
Yeah it’s like at the casino and betting red/black on roulette. If you lose you just double up your next bet. Can’t go tits up
Damn solo
Made 400 bucks in 10 minutes from my expensive ass solo calls
why do i even take profits, SOLO literally can't go down
[removed]
FUCK THIS SHIT IM JERKIN OFF
This is a growth stock.  I'm loaded up on calls
Ur still positive tho. Thats a win. A small win but nonetheless a win
Is SOLO actually legit or is it another one of those times where WSB entices me into losing tons of money?
Yolo into Fisker?
AYRO and RVP expired on 18 December, DLTR on 11 December. My fear is orange man is getting desperate, will say/do something to screw everyone.

Took my cost back for Solo 12.5c dec18.   
Now to just let the remaining ride for pure profit
Actually you might be right. I didn't realize the SPAC went public in July. I thought it was more recent.
gonna let him gamble his own childhood instead of you doing it on his behalf? smart. reSpoNsIBiliTy lesson
Until monthlies expire today in which all but one are ITM. Parabolics always pull back at some point even if only momentarily to catch their breath.
That will just make all the basic bitches want them 10x more if they’re hard to get.
[removed]
For retards who want to abandon NIO and PLTR to FOMO into AYRO at $9 now, remember AYRO was
 
- $22.80 in March 2019, 
- $249.60 in Oct 2017, and 
- $706,395 in March 2000. 

Google if you don't believe.
PLTR back over 19 baby. To 20 we goooo
Can’t wait for the weekend dow. Such a good indicator.
They have weeklies lol.
Which comes out to, two billion five hundred fifty-five million a year. Idk if you’ve got your math right.
FUV killing it again
Literally missed out on 3x-4x baggers, amounting to $20-25k. Had ETSY and W 11/27 calls. Both are up 3x-4x since I had bought them right at the bottom, but sold too soon 😔😔😔
I have $200 SQ calls expiring today. Should I hold till the afternoon or sell now?
Hope you bought that TSLA dip. 520 EOD
FUV you fucking monster
I sold it at $6 AMA

Go SHOP go!  Save me from all the other mistakes I made today!
Bruhhh, shit like this makes me so scared for the overall stock market. Whenever I see weird companies like this moon all of a sudden, I get PTSD from March and get close to going cash gang completely (or PLTR gang, since that shit is going to moon no matter what)
Ciic and tsla 🚀 🚀 🚀
Mobile typing lol. And of course I work for Uncle Sam, how do you think your wife’s foodstamps get approved?
I’ve held Arcimoto for 6 months, sold 12.50 calls because they were still stagnant after very good news. They decided to jump 8 dollars the next two days.
I jumped all over the 12/18 17.50 this morning. Let's gooooooo
Fuckin dead 🤣
I can't stand Jumia. I bag held this junk for over a year waiting for it to come back to anywhere near break-even. I will gladly short it with you.

JIMA 02/19/2021 $20P - pretty pricey premium because of the volatility, but I'm hoping this thing gets wrecked back down to sub-$10 where it belongs.

Becareful, did the same thing with nio, got burned bad

SOLO $3 Call 6/18/21

Insider trading with stocks like airlines going down cause probs a lockdown and ZM going up just hasn’t caught on to Netflix yet
Then sell the contracts
Mid 20’s
Boomer strat.
Bull flag on SOLO
imagine not going into SOLO even though it has actual sales, you autists amaze me everyday
Well if you look at it’s price history since inception is down -100%. So the only way is up right ?
Jump in Solo if you're retarded like me.
And you've got to get the interview first.
Im a pilot and talked to plenty of FOs and Captains who had flown that same type aircraft and they said it was just a matter of turning the autopilot off. It was a lack of training and communication and not really the fault of the plane.
Read the writing on the wall and dropped that shit ASAP. Fuck AAPL, never buying again lmao.

Go AMD, go
You'll be ok

Are we allowed to ban all RKT pumpers now? Fk me

Nvm I sold it for 105 percent gain no way this run up is sustainable in the short term.
Nice try PLTR Bears... We're back, and we're mooning 🚀
Sold solo at 10 🤡. Boomer strats making me poor
Nancy pump getting bull dreams up
Obviously we don't need a stimulus tons of people have plenty of money to throw in to shitty stocks. Can't be hurting too bad.
When and how?
Thoughts on  VTRS calls
Bull gang what we buyin?
Edit..prius....phone autocorrected
Put 5k into shares mate. ARKK, qcln and whatever else you want. yolo the rest. congrats
Spy probably gonna be $359 end of days cause I’m balls deep in $350p 11/27.
BRUH I JUST DID THE SAME THING WITH SOLO, like being down 96¢ per share is A LOT better than down 96%
Can’t go broke taking gains
Is there a car announcement today?
EOSE is p solid, I'm just waiting for more retarded money to go in before I sell
After meme nio now its memeing solo hahaha gotta love the sub
I'm surprised. How are they not making tones of money? It seems like every kid plays this.
What? What world are you in. ? It’s a fact the vaccines will be a reality and every news cause bullish. Come on lammer .
which means their sales (canada only) will be limited even more.  what a joke valuation
drop top
LADSSSSSSSSSSSS if tsla aint atleast 515 by end of next week your boys account gonna BLOW UP
They’ve got me twice today already. I still think it’ll break 505 next week but I just wanted to get in low dammit
LET US GOOOOOOO NIOOOO 50++++++++ cmon join energies
🤔👀👻
They make single rider cars... so like electric bikes with a casing lol
solo -> $20 min imo
what is the target price for PLTR by year end? $50 or $100?
Bear case-  we have a huge anti-vaccine issue in America.  Even the more level headed doctors I know are apprehensive of taking this thing when it is approved.  Plus, commercial real estate is currently straining the banks.  additionally more aid was just denied by the treasury. New York is closing down indoor dining and gyms sometime next week and California has already hit the emergency brakes in reopening.  And unemployment rate is increasing steadily.

Bull case- stonks go up
Toyota is still selling the primus. That car has been selling for what..10 or 15 years now?
Thanks for being patient
Bought 3 solo shares at $3. Now I wish I got more 😐
I bought a single $280c for 12/18 that’s all the Gyna stock exposure I want
FUV
I'm down for the big ballpark ones with cheese, but obviously that's an occasion
Isn’t drinking at a bar the pre ritual before trading ? That’s when the best ideas come out
I feel like you weren’t made for this sub
no. You're probably seeing today's expiring options because you have some? It will only let you sell.
Haha! Did claw some back, down $1.1k only. Which was like -$3k earlier :)
We got this - hang tight
[removed]
Hmmm not sure why it changed 1,800 to 1.8Mil. Anyone have good ideas on how to turn 5k to 1.8mil?
Means double the deliveries
It’ll get ugly before it gets worse but I’d diamond hands that shit..
Lol - imagine listening to the Tesla ticker or some shit like it was a podcast.
Lessons from this economy: did some DD on Solo. Saw it run from $4 to $6 to $8 and then retract. It always has historically tanked within a week of run up on EV sympathy, their products are silly and their sales sheets and numbers are bearish. Went hard on $5 puts weeklies. Rolled them. Got squeezed out hard. It’s sitting at $12 per share for no reason. Whoever times this short will make a killing. But unfortunately, it looks like it won’t be me, oh well it’s just money ... total loss, puts expiring worthless 

TLDR: SOLO shorts will make someone rich, unless someone buys this clown car company. 

Positions 
BABA dec 18 calls, PLTR nov calls
Whats the bull case for BABA
UTZ potato chips are the best chips i have ever had. They are always sold out at my local grocery store.

Try the honey barbecue... best flavor hands down.
SOLO gooooo!
Seconded. Except suggest expiration date to be longer.
It’s a month out calm yo titties, expect another huge bump when they enter the 500 next month.
Who else be playin up SQ??
Yep same here, got all hot and bothered by that bear post and yeeted myself into a bunch of terrible puts.  At least I'm just back to where I started a couple days ago instead of down 50%.
Thanks, maybe ill pull the partial trigger
Sold a few FUV 11/20 10C’s earlier this week for $0.20, AMA 🤡
Damn sold SOLO too too early.
Sold out of SOLO at 6.95 for profit. Figured it wouldn't go any higher. Ugly ass car. God damn
Oh ok were just going to pile back into tech at ATH like it's may again.
[deleted]
I wanna be rich
Have options expiring today and it says I can’t buy more?
We could rename it FAGATN
I know airlines would store cookies on your browser and they would use that to know your interest in flights and increase the prices.

FUV with a 35% swing before noon.  Healthy!
My gut saved me today, chose to be mature and enjoy my gains and not FOMO in
No way so u started with about 1k. Hell na i dont buy it 😐😐😐😐
$555c and i bought them Wednesday and thursday
I think I like playing this game called stocks
up 300% on my SOLO 12.5c 12/18 🤤
Virgin retards start freaking out when pltr drops .3% just keep holding like a chad idiot.
Agree!!!

But that’s to my point, not yours.
There I am. Still at loss. Bought end of August.
Buy low sell lower. I love doing that 😌
Tesla doesn’t have a top
Might buy EOD but Im not that convinced atm.
That's about right.... What did you do in the end?
Im worried you are right.
I don’t have to imagine because it was me. Held leaps and finally sold today.
11c 2/19 F. Some easy money
Could be, for sure, i just dont want to go up like a retard and tank so bad later. Slowly but going up is ok
GameStop? More like gamedrop

It will probably be a long, long time before other countries want to buy Boeing Max.

[deleted]
they sell half a car
I keep harping on my mistakes.
I hear you brother, thats awesome! got in at 2,7 CAD. They're doing an amazing job. Its about catching those goldies before the hype hits in. IMO its riskier to jump on the hype of AYRO etc. than this one.. but time will show. The gains are gonna be real with this one if they accomplishes their mission.
Why would it spike?
How? Source? Are we talking small dollars and cents? Maybe its not as wild as it sounds... but it really sounds like a slippery slope
Please for the love of god already I can’t take it anymore!
wow u can actually make money buy just buying a ton of shares. why was i fking with options lol
SOLO puts just gotta time it correctly 
Don’t enter when the retard strength is there 
Or just don’t touch it
Glad I sold my put at open
Robinhood has 0DTE options now?? Damn we gone lose even more money now
Everything dumping and nio just going up none stop
$555
Tried using GoodRX to get my adderall cheaper. "Sorry we don't accept GoodRX for controlled substances" Instead of being $45, thug CVS wanted $200. Most stingy drug dealer on the block.
How? Source? Are we talking small dollars and cents? Maybe its not as wild as it sounds... but it really sounds like a slippery slope
Dump
Do you think the stock is worth investing in? Then take the shares.

Do you just want to capture the short term gain? Sell the options.
Lol 

I'm the complete opposite position of you. Big in XPEV and no capital for NIO. I think they'll both do well (the big hedge funds seem to think so). Don't chase the FOMO, it'll get us in trouble. I say just hold long on either or and we'll be fine.
I loaded up this morning 12/18 20c next stop tendie town
Momentum is strong today and up 10%. Might be pushed to 55 by EOD. If anything happens, my call is far enough out to rebound and still print if I need to hold any longer. Was going to squeeze some profit off of it today then rebuy back into my safe haven CRSR next week.
Vacinnes. The truth hurts.
Look at PLUG fighting to stay green in a world of red. I'm telling ya'll, now is the time to jump in. I want all of you retards to eat your tendies. Go now my autistic children, and let me fill your lives with the fruits of my loins.
We will be around $20+ for that time
Look at that UTZ chart though. Tasty.
We all getting xmas presents from daddy JPow
Thats what I was thinking. I was only working my ass off to accumulate these lil pennies to where it is at now, so I could just triple it in a YOLO. I’m pretty sure that’s how people get rich
ZM on it's daily slow fade into oblivion
If you don't like the merger you can redeem your shares for $20 each.  Very small risk for potential huge upside.  If it's Stripe...my god....

This is probably the way
Just got off the phone with Nancy she said stimulus talks are going well and that bears are fucked
Dump for easy money, or chance a drop for maybe slightly more
Some dude was buying massive blocks, it was insane.  There was a single buy order for a million shares, 1.5% of total shares in one buy.  Someone massive is getting in, or Cohen is prepping for the takeover.
I'm holdin'

Alright solo this is ridiculous I'm buying puts

Who’s ready for da Netflix spike
lame duck trading day
Talks of possible stimulus talks going well.
she sucked her way into the WH for sure man, she used to be so fine too
The longer it hovers around the same price the lower the volatility the lower the price. I don't see it taking off today at this point but it could march a little higher
Dumped my remaining shares just now.
ZM headed to 405, max pain today
That happens here too.

Very true. I just have a bad habit of going “what if” with certain things.
No
I sure hope so. But FUV and SOLO in the meantime....

FUV and AYRO with big dick pumps early
BBY calls?
Shitcoin is really gonna do it
I’d have to double check but I thought the subscription increase was fine last quarter. I agree LT they will have limited content and students are definitely only using this shit to cheat. But based on their covid growth it seems this gets abused even more in an online school setting.
I thought so yesterday not having a good time rn lol
Ok sounds good 👍

Solo isn't even sold in US
I will say this much, the microtransaction portion of the game does stand on thin ice, as any targeted competition could replicate their model with relative ease and destroy the entire price model. See: any indie game that operates on a completely different mentality than corporate profit above all else
XPEV
it will be $20 on monday
Get a load of this guy: He tripled his money and held 🤡
You guys thinking NIO gonna keep going or should I take my profits and wait for next dip

wow AYRO why didnt i catch this one
I just sold all my SOLO to buy the FSR dip

China's State Administration for Market Regulation said on Tuesday that it's ***seeking feedback on a variety of anti-monopoly rules like offering different prices to different consumers for the same product based on the use of data and algorithms***, according to The Journal.

I was saying to myself this morning "damn, tsla put premiums are way too expensive" you know what's more expensive? The loss on diamond handing these calls lol.
it's so great being reminded how many people changed the course of their lives in the last 8 months, and while i had my wins-- absolutely nothing has been life changing and that makes it feel like a wicked loss
straight up rollin the dice.

imagine thinking those DC cocksuckas are going to give any stimulus 😂😂
Im still perplexed how they went up 100% in 5 days.
Shorting DD was on fucking point today.
Nothing better than buying options over 100% IV right
Nio can you tank already
Theta are away at my fucking TSLA shorts goddammit

Yes. Think of the fun you could have with all those tendies. I've had a few drinks at a bar, so my advice isn't particularly reliable right now though.

Guhhh
RKT?
102% with a 2% margin of error my friend.
FANG don’t even move 1% anymore. sad
Everyday I see SQ calls go up, up and up on my watchlist while I sit and do nothing about it.
Look what it did today lmao all it takes is for it to gap up due to lockdown news
RIP TSLA and RKT
SOLO YOLO

Quit memeing SOLO! I got in this morning and up big now but no day trades to sell
How many TSLA bull traps are there gonna be today fuckin a
How could a leap be in that bad of shape. Date/Strike?
SOLO is the scam of all scams
All in UPS $170 January who’s down
Is that fucking monopoly money
That's my point though. I'm pointing out the vaccine is going to hit the market very quickly - vaccines being injected in non-trial participants in December is a big deal. I'm not suggesting what the consequence of that is. I have my own perspectives, but it's not what I'm trying to say.

If you think the vaccine will make the market dump that's a fair POV, and now you have a time horizon to work with.
I myself had to get 2 accounts because now u can only use chegg on 2 devices.
Are there any cybercoin ETF’s? If not there should be
I bet that worked out well! Congrats :)
tsla???
these Unity swings are wild!
Lmao good luck. Etsy 200 in 6 months book it
35 contracts here. 20 x 90c 01/15. And a few other strikes including 82.5 and 85. Most of them were bought at a pretty shit price though pre earnings.
Whatever tesla is at close, im buying a call for next friday.
no wayyyy
Turned $1k into $3k with TSLA earlier this week and now back to $1100 kewl
I didnt sell, thankfully.
It’s based on the DD that has been posted in this sub if you search PSTH and Yolo Capital Management on Twitter.
[deleted]
SOLO is going full retard
SOLO will be another HTZ.  GTFO while you still are making money.  No one is gonna buy some freak show tripod clown car where you'd turned into a road pancake in an accident in the US given the tremendous popularity of Cadillac Escalades and F150s.
hey, still waiting for a dip before I enter. looks like it could be soon, any thoughts ?
I understand that but that’s causing the rise. The company has release no official statement on mergers or company policy so it’s the only explanation. Their batteries could be purchased by EV companies, which gains if NKLA, TSLA, NIO and others rise
well.. sold xpev last friday :) Love to see it
Why are you using excel to chart? Do you even trade bro?
Narrator: he doesn't have any DD
Let’s be honest Cramer was the First WSBer guy ran around on crack and hit buttons throwing stuff making crazy calls ....

The fact we shit on him and he shits in us is just proof he is one of us... cause we shit on each other
[deleted]
Imagine not getting in COTY while it’s actually low and not at ATH. Get in shit is gonna rocket soon
Solo is so fucking stupid i don’t understand why is this shit stock still going up
I will donate all my winnings if Li hits $40. You name the charity.
I’ll hold your hand bro (no homo)
Highly doubt, $2 is a lot, all week has been trading from 17 to 18 (max 19) $2 drop would been significant as imo
Why gambling with TSLA, JMIA stopped climbing now its BABA time.
bull flag on TSLA
Playing it safe with fake money. Good for you, thats good parenting.
Ummm have you seen the car?
Time to short.
same dude don’t even worry, i sold at a .45c drop coz of my autism and then it went up another 5 dollars before i bought it again, now only on a $2 gain when i could’ve been on a $7 gain, we’re all pretty fucking retarded hence the subreddit, and i think i fucked the maths as well but you get my point
That’s what I do. Turn x into 2x and then Yolo x. It’s taken me from 5k to 35k
How are those AMD puts doing? Lmao
[deleted]
Hey retard btw that HDS thing that some other retard posted wont work. Sure theyre being sued by 5 different firms but thise firms are arguing they should be paid MORE than $56 a share or whatever. If they win, your puts are worthless, because stonk goes up. If they lose, your puts are still worthless because its $56 a share distributed.
SAME
I’m really gonna have to do so much research into existing truck markets/ emissions legislation/EV truck market/ heaps of stuff I didn’t know I didn’t know
Glad I didn’t fomo into TSLA today

11/27 550c NVDA looks like a god damn bargain sale
New round of Stimmy talks going well. Fuck you Munchkin!!
You lost over a million dollars from 10/22. Congratulations you beautiful retard.
any vaccine rumors on monday that would tank tech?
Why is it better than pltr
I said synthetic long put not short.

The long ATM call is to protect you from being short squeezed.

You win if the price drops or rises by more than the premium+borrow rate. Literally can't go tits up.
My first attempt at puts worked out really well that one Monday ZM puts were up 5000%, subsequent attempts have yet to be fruitful.
Wonder if today is a good day for PLTR leaps or they will further be on sale Monday
Whats your play? Expiration date?
all in GDXJ boys and girls
Dude fuck these people that short GameStop and SmileDirectClub
Hyllion wyd?
Well fuck I thought I was buying the TSLA dip at 495. This isn't looking good
This guy is too whole for this subreddit. r/wholesomestreetbets
i am in the same boat. 3 calls but 500 strike and exp 12/24.

lets die trying to get rich
Ok that’s mildly comforting ... will I see gains or break even
Can Tesla stop dying
So are we gonna transition from Faang to Faagt now. Is that gonna be the benchmark of where everyone aspires to work in faagt?
#the sell volume on Apple 😱😱😱
Roblox beat me up and took my lunch money

edit: oh wait that was AAWW
Couldn’t stay away from some spx 3490s. Needed some way to lose some of these XPEV profits.
Tesla trying to fake me out
Good job bro now turn 8.6k to 0 like a true autist
Gains are gains mate
BABA $300c 12/4
Holy shit Giuliani probably has covid LOL

White House press briefing at noon btw
[removed]
BABA is the next PLTR
FOMO’d into SOLO. Decent long term play? Bought shares
Such a gay bear take
Zm up pricing in incoming restrictions and lockdown i think. Just my lazy man way of doing DD 

SPY puts 
BA Puts
TSLA puts
Whale said 680c TSLA so I buy 680c TSLA
They also own Reverb, e-com for music gear and it’s printing piles of cash and part of the reason Guitar Center is filing for bankruptcy.
When is it? Ill probably buy a few puts
Same story here. Saw it was up 45% today, bought 700 shares at 8.20 and sold at 8.80 for a quick 400$ profit within an hour. I have no clue what AYRO is tbh
Something tastes sweet.. almost like KNDI
Pretzels?
Stimulus pump in 3..2..1
Fuck you, I bought on October 22nd and have made $35 so far.
55c 12/28 yolo NIO
no there aren't the market is limited
Is there any hope for my tesla calls expiring next week? Down $1400
And do what? Lose their safety net next month when it crashes?
Good thing I hedged my Tesla calls lol
Check back in a week..
BABA BOOYAO
Makes sense, I think there’s still plenty of downside in the short and medium term but could pay off if they can rebrand & buy clean energy firms
Ontop of the world
I sold at 30. I hate myself
My loss is your gain
Welp GDRX fell off kinda pisses me off....😑
Because this might be the most profitable holiday for them yet.
Most of the related studies from that page seem to suggest it causes heart failure
would love to see it hold a steady +50. This one doesn't like being between weird number like 46.50-48, to 50 lol. I think +50, and it's a shot to like 55
Anyone with a 401K that has any tech exposure whatsoever, which is a whole lot of people. .
Can you convert to McNuggets? I think it would really help me picture it better.
Rug pull is when all bears are dead and only permabulls are left, buying each dip until they're dead too. Years will pass with economic hardship until a new generation of degnerates graduating middle school will have enough allowence to buy calls, begining a new ears of permabulls who never learned of the before time
You're going to start hosting trading seminars after you made $350 in a year?? I can't tell if this is a joke or not.
Just wait, once these PLTR calls print it’s high roller life for me. No more Dollar Tree, we’re going to Walmart now baby!
So how much did you invest in DBX before you realized you got cucked?
Probably because it's not as volatile as other stocks. They've had consistent growth, if slower, and big potential through next year. Seems very undervalued.
Holy shit lol rip
Friendship with NIO has ended.

AYRO is now my new best friend.
Fuck off with your shit post.
This DD must be the fake news we've been warned about for so long
Same boat as the other American EVs that are still up for the week.
It doesnt mean people need a new keyboard and mouse ????
More details
Yea, they do. SOLO has 1 single seater car and they're about to push $12. Shouldn't have sold.
Hey asshole. Some of us are autistic *and* retarded.
Got in, thanks!
Thanks for the sincere reply buddy <3 I'll just have to cope and find alternative treatments and hope that science comes up with an effective solution during my lifespan

Edit: WSB and option trading is really helping with that haha
of course
For those that don't know the packaging dimensions for vaccine vials....theu come in shipped in a cubic foot of Styrofoam that's 4 inches thick with 2 ice packs that are 1.5 inches thick each. Theres alot of protection already involved with the transportation of the vials.
theres only one way to find out brother, best of luck

I've seen the movie Margin Call

MM's are calmly exiting their positions in the AM, ready for the PM drop
And he bases this absolutely on nothing lol.
 hope you make money!
Yeah, it's really bizarre that it keeps tanking after two stellar earning calls. I currently don't have any positions in it and stayed away mostly because WSB and reddit in general hyped it up a lot after IPO. But after going back and listening to their earnings calls, I think it's a great company and currently oversold. I'm gonna get some 2022 leaps at the end of today.
BABA is definitely the safer of the two. But PLTR has more upward potential for the overall cost.
Naw I am with you on that.  Being slightly down is ok, now if it starts drilling down into the 17s I would be a bit concerned.

Slightly red isn’t terrible as it means that the super speculative folks get shook out and entices other folks to take profit, which lowers the risk of random sharp drops.
[deleted]
Who gives a shit, half the meme stocks on here are mooning 5-10% right now ... I’m just salty I sold
Sure 🐌 gang is boring as fuck but it's a lot more relaxing to watch the account just slowly go up in value rather than swing back and forth thousands every tick.
deez nuts
Wonder if chegg has the same issue as netflix - Slow user subscription increase and limited content. And for most students, chegg is only a place for answer copy-pasting, not a good learning platform.
Please keep buying my spy fds. I've been eating good thus week
Ciic wasnt the one.
I keep shitting on SOLO, but you boys are making some money so good on ya
Not enough negative money. Too much cashgang. No T puts.

What is this trash, OP?
PLTR has more upside BABA probably safer bet I would still go PLTR
Unless you get all of your proper certifications this is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
that guy that put a million into pton has gottA be happy rn
When your portfolio is U/CRSR/NIO/XPEV and everything is still going 📈📈📈 🥰
Yeah but I know there’s money to be made when Biden inevitably announces the hire of a bunch of former FB employees.
11/20 420p do it pussy
Lol good thing you didn't give him real money!
wtf tsla
Oooh interesting, can't trade it on my shite UK apps though
Damn lol bye bye Tesla
B L D M
its not even EV related when you actually research the company...
You’re gonna see a lot more negative before it gets there. But it will get there
Tldr buy pltr
Slowly turned 3.9k into 8.6k. Should I sell out everything now and just yolo it on Tesla calls? The retard in me is coming out
[deleted]
Tesla fumbling the bag
It's been rallying for the entire week lmao. 🐽 get slaughtered my dude
Yeah I mean my personal observation is kids love it. I don’t see myself playing it but it’s not bad. I think some or the creative stories are actually pretty great. I.E. there are the equivalent of escape from this room stuff that’s puzzle-like. Not bad imho
What to hold during weekend?
We printing 🤑🤑🤑
well into may be a stretch, but ill give you 19.25 from VWAP. loser buys beers?
Welcome to America 🇺🇸
This is so wholesome mon garcon, i truly feel blessed reading this

PLTR is hemorrhaging, should I dump my leaps at a 99% loss?
Aye
I do dig the bag tbf. Sure they taste great too, but I don't really eat chips these days
PICS OR BAN 😉

It’s cool I sold just after 10am. I lost out on some of that run but now I can relax a bit.
Is this final ZM dip before 500?
My friend's dog groomer sucks off Senators on the side, and he said big news is coming. And there's no Senator named Big News.

SPY $310 EOD
Anyone buying the tesla dip?
[deleted]
Did a little math:

Short squeeze from a vote like that could push it over $100 a share pretty easily.  A normal short squeeze wouldn't, but a vote share recall could.  He has what, 5k calls at an average of 15c?  If he sold at $100, totally ignoring the IV/Theta value (so basically exercised)...it would be a profit of 8.5k per call, times 5000.


So in that instance, he would be looking at 42.5 million.  So 100 is probably not so likely.  But this is also only in the event that a full vote happens and most of the lent shares are recalled
You son of a bitch, I'm in
[removed]
I'm feeling some XPEV FOMO, but also trepidation because I have a fairly big stake in NIO. It's a bit emotional, but NIO helped carry me out of a hole after I jumped on JKS right before the crash from 90. I don't have the capital to jump on both, but the price targets look stellar for both (and LI, to a lesser extent).   


I am wondering how/when/if the focus on battery-as-a-service will differentiate NIO.
Does anyone actually know somebody who’s invested in Twitter or Facebook? I see their tickers on RH all the time and I’m just wondering who the hell actually has money in there
Will ZM save my portfolio? Find out next week.
Sir this is a casino
Call me a 🌈🐻 but i’m selling tonight

someone give me a good reason why i shouldnt short sell etsy
Whats that trade?
So you’re of the opinion that the inherent design of the plane is the blame and not the software and controls? Please, show your DD on this. Would love to peruse.
How funny is it that all EV stocks mooning almost besides TSLA the king
both
PTON CALLS
My buddy got a job with them recently. Its got a good product and have been working hard to get their coil technology adopted by all new EV car companies. Could be big, so I bought in at 2.22. I think its a better bet than AYRO which is very hyped right now.
Taken home a net profit of $350? You shitting me right

True, the shareholders who want to earn extra by selling covered calls deserve to FOMO into it. Although few would sell CC.

As to the 2nd point, no idea. I'll diamond hands the small amount of shares of this till 2050 or something, a small dent in the grand scheme of things.

What makes you think that?
AYRO and SOLO are hilarious to me that they are mooning with the other EV plays. Does anyone even know what type of vehicles these companies design? Hint: it ain’t like Tesla, NIO, XPEV, LI or FSR. But ride the EV wave I guess, why not.
Get some spy puts while they are still cheap
Better leaps right now? BABA or PLTR?
All I know is my 3 year old daughter eats like 2 bags every week of their Salt & Vinegar chips. Position entered 30 mins ago and already up over 20%. A+
up 500 today but i already spent 1k on black friday sales. am I doing this right?
Probably lots lol
I have been wanting to buy xpev, but waiting for any kind of pull back. I know if I buy it, that’s the top
VXX doesn’t think this is a sell off time to buy the dip
Fuck outta here with your rational thinking
Time to load TZA. Small caps must die
You’re missing out. Not sure what to tell you other then to buy some voodoo chips on Amazon and be convertedz
In my opinion, it was an overreaction with a correction combination that made it drop $20.

Oh man I’m aboutta eat good 😌
And NIO never saw 48 again.
It's taking a little break before going up again. Remember what happened yesterday, it chilled at 11.80 for a while then fucking exploded lol
This is cool and all, but I kind of miss when the stock market sort of made sense 50% of the time and you could get mad when it was irrational. Now it's just total random crazy town every day.
Why can I only buy a 15 dollar call?
ban him until he loses all $2M.

Anyone who thinks $BA is out of the woods with the Max is kidding themselves. The pilots are not fans of it and all it's going to take is one incident after return to flight and they're done.   
   
Boeing made a mistake taking the software-to-keep-it-from-crashing approach with a passenger aircraft. Having software tricks to keep the aircraft stable is an accepted risk in military aircraft where you are making tradeoffs in the interest of one performance metric or another. It's not acceptable when you have a couple of hundred souls on board innocent of the controls. After two crashes Boeing should have just reset and scrapped the aircraft, not continue to push a bad hand.
-88% in one trade 🥴
People think the fact that they’re ugly will affect their commercialization; have people seen Priuses before?
FUV💥
It looks like shit
Okay, how about I give you 10 minutes?
Nio such a tease @ $50
It was just shares , but still
Fuck you
Sit pat buys. Buy leaps. Don’t look. Don’t manage. Don’t close early.
Not just green but +8% lol
Absolutely MASSIVE call buying for SPY 12/4 370c.  4.3k OI vs 61.6k Volume.
Ah, yeah I have those too
Yup pretty much. But your whole life savings is probably on RH so who is worse 🤡🤡
Why tho
You know how hard it is to back seat mod... this post didn't get removed so great idea!
JMIA going down down! Watch out
Lmao
Short squeeze from a vote like that could push it over $100 a share pretty easily.  A normal short squeeze wouldn't, but a vote share recall could.  He has what, 5k calls at an average of 15c?  If he sold at $100, totally ignoring the IV/Theta value (so basically exercised)...it would be a profit of 8.5k per call, times 5000.

So in that instance, he would be looking at 42.5 million
It’s been fun GG
Currently it's a turd
Thank you.
Idk if this is some regional thing, but I've lived all over the US and the only brand I even recognize here is TGIF.  

The rest of the logos honestly look like shitty off-brand snacks. Like I'm sure they taste fine, but I can think of 10 processed food companies I'd invest in before I even started researching what an "utz" is.
I can't believe my portfolio is up today
Because it's also bullish.
Nancy is giving a school type presentation on how voting works for those confused on the issue.  


\*head in hands moment\*
PLTR profit taking no biggie, unless you’ve got 0DTE.

For a hot second there the 11/27 20c was dropped down to 1/3 the price it was at peak open. Hope you lunatics noticing IV messing you up from Fomo-ing in 2 days ago leveraged down your base cost per call. Going to print hard.
Shorting zm regardless of earnings
wow PTON. Bagholding for fucking 6 days and gives me - 88% and as soon as I sold it, it moon?
100% agree dude I was just thinking this. Literally slap “EV” on your fucking company name and/or description and you’ll double your market cap in a week.

U just made me 1500$ thanks bruh

IPO'd yesterday give it a few days for options

That's not true, they've produced quite a bit, I believe something like 30K cars this year.
Probably me.

 Buy leaps.
DISCA
Higher 🚀
what is that, like $10 in freedom bucks?
I'm disappointed tbh. BABA 12/18 300 high yesterday was 2.09 and high today is 2.04. And BABA is a good $4 higher than yesterday. IV must have dropped a bit.
His point is he doesn't understand logarithms
💯
Ty
Calls on fridges! 🤡
Lol kxin
I started with 3 and was content to lose 333 yesterday because I had a Tesla 470 that was printing. Then the inner autist saw 9 dollar contracts and decided to try reducing my cost basis. 2-3k later I got it to 12 and seriously increased my exposure but also open the door to win.  Xpev rising yesterday and their announcement today of new car and lidar sealed the victory and my paper hand kept me from more profits.
Telos
There was that one dude who yolo'd his first million into PTON. Dang. He's probably like a 2-millionaire now.
It’s bottomed out. Time to ride baba to Valhalla
Why are calls so cheap?
Jack ma found dead
It’s almost like they don’t have any products or revenue
You had me in the first half, but you don't need to gloat SO hard about it.
Are you me? sold 10x 105c lol 

F
Sell, toss into PLTR
Okay fine I scooped some PLTR calls
Getting our daily dose of stimulus talks going well
I got in on FCEL 4.5c’s for $4 a contract early this week, sold them all off around 500% and they were over 2000% at open the next day
I also think people are underestimating the markets that exist for cars that Solo and Ayro builds. They might not be considered the most fashionable in the US, but a lot of developing countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil, etc. would be great avenues for these companies to expand into. Extreme population growth, improving pollution measures, tighter road infrastructure nations will be big markets for these compact EVs.

It seems their truck starts at 67,500 USD.  So it's quite a bit more.  This isn't typical gun and apple pie guy type pricing.  Actually the gun and apple pie type guys with that kind of money for trucks are dumping it into F-350s and turbodiesel duallys with huge smokestacks.  The noise and the smoke are part of the appeal.

I think 50-70k dollar EV trucks are primarily going to sell to yuppies initially.   If they can halve the price, they might make entry into work truck service though.
Atleast 20. This ayro and kndi are all just playing catch up now and people wanna buy more shares of these cuz they’re cheaper. Business model literally means nothing right now. Just buy a ticket for the train and enjoy the ride.
I didn't take a loss on SOLO but I did get measly gains compared to now. I am removing them from my watch list. It's too painful  :(
Yeah, I'm not confident enough to say what it means for you. Vaccine could mean the market dumps. It could mean value continues to go up. Could mean tech crashes....could mean everything flies. You've gotta judge this.
Market since March:

- good news: bullish
- bad news: bullish
- no news: bullish
-TA: doesn't matter
- economic recession: bullish
- lockdowns: bullish
- deadly virus: bullish
- election with potential coup: bullish
- brink of civil war: bullish
- electrons in each element: bullish

Me, autistic: *why did my puts not print?*
Those things hang. She rub her clit with her nipples.
I can see SOLO going to 20, as long as there's demand in us and Canada. If they start selling in Europe, the stock could hit 40-50
I just fomo'd into XPEV

yall just watch FUV return what spy returns in an entire year in 5 seconds? yea me too lol
I can’t believe it’s November 2020 and FB 300C is still a degenerate play. Zuckerberg sucks
But you did this in 3 weeks, was it all for options expiring much further out?
my stupid ass
For sure, 11/27 calls on sale get them while you can. 11/20 20c will print by EOD.
Am I the only one who's not dissapointed in PLTR being down? Long term this is good. You can't expect it to keep mooning every day. It needs to have some sort of sustained growth
Wtf baba what the actual fuck
Fuck it, just yolo'd my last 450 bucks on NIO 11/27 43p. Nothing else is fucking working at this point so why not.

Lol this market
GO HYLN MAKE DADDY PROUD
You keep saying lockdown when it is actually a curfew.
RKT is dead to me. By far my biggest loss to date. It makes no sense that a digital mortgage company is not growing in the middle of a pandemic where the market is red hot. I’m sure once my calls expire today the price will soar.
I’m riding. I think it’ll rise further on Monday. Boomer investors need to buy more and so does hedge funds
If anything I could see people rotating back into EV meme stocks if the market in general does dip. I think we'll see a break out past $52
Someone get FSR some milk,  only EV down for the week as far as I can tell.

NKLA Press Release: we have invented a way to reduce the cost of producing dry ice by 83%. 

<does absolutely nothing>

<stock up 300%>
What's their story?
Y’all are welcome for ZM & PTON.
Congrats
I've bought into RKT so much to offset some higher price purchases that I've 100%+ offset any higher price purchases. I was up over 1K last week but was greedy and didn't cash out a penny. Stubborn to the end.

XPEV GREEN DILDOS PLEASE
Last week I was up 8% on RKT and now I’m down 2% fuck this shitty stock dude it’s just drilled for a week straight
I think nio is leveling off
What is the scary news for mortgages? Is it defaults? I thought RKT was a loan originator and thus doesn't get affected by defaults? Am I mistaken?
Flair checks out
So near term means the next 4 hours?
Look at SPI. It short squeezed in September.

if you search blaze capital they have an algo that'll send you updates on buy alerts. You get a free ticker to get a notification for. Im sure theres something out there for just "if tesla hits 505 send me an email" but not aware of it.
Me too cause i’m a genius
TLS is cybersecurity giant from 1971 IPO'd yesterday. This is PLTR 2.0 if not even better.
PTON 💋
Does this mean they bought at that price or that they are selling at that price? Sorry for the retarded question

Pump HYLN baby pump
Keep fighting PLTR!!! 🚀
Ok was skeptic, but I agree digital growth direct sale could be an op for them. Everyone I know has always talked about their specific chips, especially the Zapps voodoo and etc specialty chips. Lays sort of suck, and ive seen them infiltrate parties and etc in the past 2 years.

Uhhh not really lmao It's down 3%
Bro hope you caught some of that SBE this week.  I don't even know what it's a SPAC for, but when I read EV I immediately 💦💦💦 and went all in
I'm numbed to the pain
Meanwhile $NVDA is shit
Zm is gonna hit 500-550 next week with the earnings run up+ lockdown news wait for a dip then buy 500c 11/27
PLTR has done this pretty much every day of the week. Opens strong, big spike, takes a ride down, and recovers EOD
Hope your wife didn’t see this
You doing alright man?!
Congrats hopefully the tendies keep printing for you. Both choices are great.
NIO coming in fucking hot, I expect $51 soon boys

Man.. this stock is so ass lol

THCBW (warrants) are an awesome risk/reward play. I’m in for about $1k worth as a small speculative bet. If the DA comes out, it Will moon for a multibagger like CIIC warrants did. THCB (shares) are pretty damn safe since they are hovering near redemption value right now. LOI looked like the deal was pretty close to finished so I’m hoping the DA comes out before the December 3rd shareholder meeting. If not, they will likely extend out to April. As with any SPAC, could be a bust, but with microvast it could also be the SPAC play of the year if merger goes well.
It’s like a Model 3’s retarded brother

Didnt want to be a tard so I bought it.  I hate you.  Just getting it out of the way for later.
Ok I lost 18k on BA this week, and I only have 2k left. I really need a good play to get most of it back. Someone please help me out
[removed]
Go back to eating your oatmeal dawg
You were right.
Yea but the market is so overvalued that vaccines will just raise the veil off the COVID equity price inflation and show everyone how completely rampant speculation has been in 2020
Makes sense. My logic on it has been, next earnings call will be primarily NFL wagers which is the big money for sports books. I see a lot of long term growth so I'm bullish for next earnings. Sold the call for what I thought was free money this week, was expecting it to be sideways mostly around 43 for a while
they print tendies
I did that with FUV too, sold half my position right before the calls went up 7000%
[https://i.ibb.co/Zc6WzbL/image.png](https://i.ibb.co/Zc6WzbL/image.png)

So, a lot of SPY dark pool prints just in:

* 500,000 | $357.48 | $179,000,000
* 500,000 | $357.48 | $179,000,000
* 1,000,000 | $357.48 | $358,000,000

I agree but I think once winter actually gets here the virus will be out of control, it’s just starting to get cold and it’s already out of control in some states. And the virus thrives in the cold, and people are to stupid to stop going to social events and shit, so I think some fuck shit will happen soon but who knows
I bought pltr today for the first time.. what they even doing lol
Goooodddamn i really wish i didnt sell shares at $3...

Bought calls yesterday, loving this
Bridgewater Associates is in Nio and Blackrock is in both. So that should provide some consolation

sold my 11/20 7.5c on monday for a 50% loss so it will obviously be at 15 by eod. sold for 0.41 each, worth literally 10x that rn
Any retards on MARA
it's interesting you say that with literally no understanding of the expense side of their business. How has a data + algorithm startup not turned a profit in 17 years? Not just unprofitable by year, but has seen accelerating losses. Presumably they have no need to invest in a large salesforce, so this is all R&D? on a data startup?

it's a joke currently, though I do believe in Thiel somewhat. Note that he made a profit on it, but I'm unsure if "long term" investors will.
uh lockdowns?

Reason you dont make money in market is that future is unknown. Most of you remember how stock ripped you off 1000 times but that not matter. What matter is future. Stock can fuck you up 1000 times and then when you are out not talking about it. It will moon to 100x just to remind you that stock market does not care about history or chart

FREE has way better stats and is very undervalued comparatively, and they are about to initiate a buyback.
Exact same shit as yesterday.
I would be careful with metals here; vol on metals appears to be declining steeply the past two weeks.

So if you're going to look at metal options (which do appear cheaper than they've been), just note that the volatility looks like it's pricing in "nothing big coming"...

Basically, to profit on metal options, you really need a big move.  A small move in either direction will be offset by declining vol.  Just worth noting.

Yes it is. Gaming and streaming shit brah

Yeah I don't get how people don't see this. The responses to this that don't acknowledge the bubble are the *exact same* as the weed stocks. Like "bro you don't get it Aphria just signed a big deal with Ontario. Aurora just got a special license from health Canada" yeah so let's give them 12 figure valuations on 7 million in revenue. There's always some hype narrative you can use to support your bullish thesis.
Per 1 contract?
Death by meme
And I'm up 5k lol
will do don’t worry, we can sit back and relax and watch it go as far down as possible, i mean that’s the fun of trading isn’t it, or i’m just a retard, eh not fussed
We pumped from 41 to 50 in less than a week. I’d imagine a pull back is bound to happen and when dkng decides to move it swings hard. Apparently more COVID cases in NFL is causing pull back?
because you're retarded
Thanks for making me feel better about the 1k i blew on 0dte today
People who missed TSLA started buying NIO, XPEV and Li. Now these chinese ADRs are also close to $50 and they can no longer afford them. So, they are now buying SOLO and AYRO. Lmao.

Put all my FSR into SOLO last night at +26%, it has been the correct choice. 😍
Lol i wish your comment was just a little more convincing haha
Facts but what people need to focus on right now is controlling the spread of the virus. I agree more people are going to be going out during Thanksgiving/Christmas season, but with congress shuffling their feet around like geriatrics on issues as important as unemployment benefits that EXPIRE THE END OF THE YEAR, this is going to be a bleak Christmas season. Stimulus is the single biggest catalyst in the market. The markets will continue to march forward on the hopes that stimulus is coming but it will always be out of reach because they will always disagree on something. Hopefully when Joe Biden takes the reigns in mid-January his first focus is on the economy, but between that and the "soon to come into the light" investigations into his family's connections to China and Ukraine, I think Joe's first few months are going to be pretty "busy". Also Donald Trump was the president during "Operation: Warp Speed". Without him YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A VACCINE. Joe Biden wants to steal all the glory as the one who brought you the vaccine. Make no mistake the plans for distribution of the vaccine have been in place for a long time. With PFE going forward with emergency approval you could potentially see a vaccine available to you by March-April. Just remember when you're getting your vaccine whose administration it was that got it to you in Record Time.
$50 is lava for Donkey Kong
Rkt is forever 21
Ayro new best friend
Bought PLTR at 19.54 ama
Ded confirmed
This market won’t dump until big money sells the news on FDA approval for Pfizer.  Then the reality of how many are available, challenges with distribution etc shows the realities of the non immediate fix of the economy
Same bro
What's causing the sell-off in RKT? I can't find any news about it on Google?
Lmao ok
I am never worried about PLTR. They are legit in the long run. Maybe not as exciting but if your risk tolerance is low slap that bitch up for some tendies. 5 bagger EO2021.
Fucking ZM!!
1HR CHART 

ZM going Up i guess.

RSI - Around neutral 
MACD - Cross over to uptrend 
Broke the ichimoku cloud, (usually above cloud you go long and not short) 

TSLA 
RSI - Overbought
MACD - crossed to downtrend
Support at 486

Seeing BA and all dropping and ZM Snap rise probably insider news of lockdown

I May Be Wrong Tho. But thats up to you :) gd day all

Why is peloton ripping?

Swing trading 0 DTE BKNG puts has been pretty easy today. It’s Friday and this is a travel stock near all time highs. It’s on a downtrend because people have realized how ludicrous it is to have travel stocks back up close to ath’s. You know the trend is down, and I’ll be shocked if BKNG closes above $2005 today. It will probably close around $2000 to kill all puts/calls. Just keep buying $2020 puts on every bump.
How is nobody talking about TLS in here? Shits PLTR 2.0
Oddly enough, i’ve read that massive growing facilities actually benefit from cooler temperatures as the cost to cool all of the equipment inside goes down significantly.
Left 19k on the table by holding on to TSLA and not selling at yesterday's high. I'm a 🤡😭. But I'm going to 💎✋ till the end because this can easily moon still in the next 4 hours. Papa Musk whip out yo dick and make it raaiinnnn
My BABA LEAP with a delta of 0.35 is up $1.32 when the stock is almost up $6. Fuck you, algos

Thought this was amusing. Only 70 percent will spend Thanksgiving alone
If it has EV in the description, you are set. I would say AYRO because it has a lot to of room to catch up.
they just say were in lockdown. It doesn't mean anything. My gym is still open, restaurants still open, and nobody wears masks where I live.
He can hold till probably 1hr before close and auto sell by robinhood if it hits 55

Yea everything I'm reading now says last day is nov 30th. I wrote down in my notes back in September that it was on Dec. 21st. Idk if there are different lockup dates for different entities? Im gonna buy a bunch of puts on Nov 27 tho
HYLN squeeze incoming
The sub seems to be pretty anti-WFH stock? At least, the most vocal sentiments about PTON/ZM seem to be that people want them to drill.
EOD PLSSSS
Looks like that GME guy is getting banned. Unfortunate.
I don't see any contradiction. I have calls and puts. What annoys me is when people get upset that the market isn't going the way they think it should be going. No one knows! Cool down 😘
The fuck are options?
Worst part of this thread is that the lines are blurred between actual good advice and pump n dumps. I seem to always fall for the latter
Been sayin that since early sept lol
Sell please
I k ow right just plummet already
I hopped on, thats why it started going down. I'm sorry.
Can someone kick FSLY in the ass so it can moon
Curfew is not lockdown.
Im going to buy more pltr stock and yes i feel retarded for doing it
Apparently NIO is more geared towards a higher-end market whereas XPEV is suited for mid-to-low-end. I don't live in China though, so I have no idea if this is actually accurate.

What a good feeling. I was bleeding on some calls I bought 2 weeks ago. Today it went up 1000% and it went from -95% down to a 100% gain. Diamond hands won again! (WORK)

Good thing mine expire 11/27.  Gimme that 🐂🍆
I sold covered calls at 47, i made peace with selling them but now I have hope lol
HYLN big green
Which means 80% of the companies will end up worthless but the other 20% will make people rich.
When did your positions expire? I have January AYRO, BLNK, and SOLO calls that im holding over the weekend. Scared tho

I find it incredibly hilarious that with all the crazy up and down volatility that good old RKT is still at 21
Honestly I don't know, I don't have exposure there except through SPY.
I did this... made me sweat balllllls. Never buying 1dte ever again, I think.

JFC, the hype on NIO fades a little and everyone frantically FOMOs into any penny stock with a connection to EV. This EV mania is what the tech bubble looked like.

It goes from 18-22 and back like clockwork.

Well, exactly why you should get leaps if it dips below $20
TSLA 510 by noon.
Palantir won't break through 20 until next week just to fuck all the 20 calls expiring today.

Market cap is still smaller dummy
yeah I think some of the bubble talk is defeatism by people who either don't know how or are to scared to play it. It is 100% a bubble, but that doesn't mean you can't make money it just means it's riskier. I understand that risk tolerance is a non-starter here though...
BABA PLEASE $300 EOM
EV is definitely pumped but it's an emerging market, still on the ground floor for the most part.
Sir, this is WSB.
If you have shares, hold. It's gonna go way up closer to the ARVL deal being done

SPY just die already. This shit is pathetic
Yes, its a reverse merger  
SRAC will become MNTS
Damn xpeng really surprised me this week, it is a solid stock and a good second to NIO but I’m surprised it passed NIO. NIO is definitely the long term winner in China but xpeng stock is gonna go up a lot too these next few years
Yep. Look at the price before it was announced. I'm not saying it will land in the same place as before, but logically it will drop a big chunk.  30-40% as the company is revalued by the market without the deal in play.
Enjoy those tends!

Bullshit and Bullish, Can PLTR aim a Bullet at the Bully called Soros.
Fro options popping off today! Still waiting for hp to explode, I assume Monday as hype for earnings builds
It’s kinda weird but I know kids play it. Less Minecraft more build your own adventure and let people play your story you’ve built. Stories that are popular get some kind or revenue. There’s definitely an element of invest in the platform (certain story building elements cost dolleroos to build, straight from the company) before you can get an roi, so there’s some heavy micro transaction elements if you’re gonna be a “storyteller,” but playing the stories is free I believe. Don’t take this as dd as I have only interfaced with this thing vicariously through a friends kid who loves to play it, but that’s what I understand about it.

It take so much space to build a nio battery swap station. You think they gonna build all over US? Hmm idk lol
Don’t doubt the PLTR
Truth.
Interesting- didn’t see that under their brand.
Anyone could invest their emergency fund in NIO though
SOLO $10 Call 12/18

SOLO $15 Call 1/15/21
Let's fucking to Zoom.
And just like that, I’m in for 250 @ $19.75. Take me to tendie town bb
HAHAHHHA RUDY for sure has it by now.. that guy is sweating like his dying
Nows not a bad time, last few years would have been better. Using past performance to predict the future, it should have room to run
So im a noob. “Rolling” means buying another one that expires in feb?
This looks likes a slow burn to nowhere on $SPY.  Theta wins.
Friendly reminder that CRSR is very much a lockdown/COVID play
Looks like PLTR is back on the menu boys!

Edit: fuck
It went up about $1 by eod from this time yesterday, they run up late in the day sometimes
Pton back in business
SOLO????? Someone check my pulse!!
I hope they wait until Sunday night to announce the delisting of NIO, so you guys can actually enjoy your weekend first.
Can we talk about Sunworks for a minute?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwoakc/the_next_ev_play_ciic_and_arrival_merger/). His advice was to buy the day before it shot up AH though. He thinks it'll go to $20 though.
made me money already. 500c 11/27 is paying too

7 layer dip on VTRS. Ouch ouch.
LET'S FUCKING GOOOO XPEV
NPR did a piece on pets and adoptions were up a crazy amount since people had time to train and spend with dogs, not to mention emotional support they provide. Combine that with lockdowns and CHWY delivering quality and quickly I see this company doing super well.
i need that

Imagine not buying that PLTR dip
Not today. This is a 20+ stonk though, will recover if dips under.

You can also find them probably locally since you may not want to buy $20 of chips off amazon. And btw, just saw UTZ actually owns dirty potato chips as well as of 2011
I hate this place. I do so much less work since following this sub.
When you got that kinda bankroll your baloney throwing days are done
Volume means that it’s changing hands quickly. Currently there are more sellers than buyers which gives buyers more control -> can get a lower ask price
Ty!
RKT is a TECH/lending company in a time of rising covid cases, historically low interest rates, and hot seller's markets with the biggest individual share of the overall lending market.

Look at BEKE for fucks sake. What the fuck is wrong with RKT. It's almost fishy.

Baba going up and my calls going down. Nice play IV.
5/21 PLTR 19p being bought up today like crazy it’s a nail biter!
You can always roll it into Feb I dont think its going to stop running for a while its a solid company and its finally being recognized. If you want peace of mind with more time to expiry just roll it out and you'll be safe
But noon is 12?
I am just giving a warning, especially with the CCP's crackdown on Alibaba and Tencent. I am long NIO and if they are ready to go after these companies, they might go after NIO, even though they were looking into anti competitive practices. Don't be a sped and start looking at things objectively.

Yo what the hell DKNG
Neeeviidia f u
Kxin again again againKXIN
TSLA going down today.
Yes
It’s a 11 am, this is typical, watch it edge $20 this afternoon
I bought in at $17 so I’m late to the party. Figured I could allocate the funds to NIO which has been my ride or die that last couple of months
I know man, but I’m holding out 😅🥴 have no other option
If you actually thought that, you should 100% play options today. Could make good money on the straddle.
Dump a whole nother dollar and I’ll cooooom
LMAO
Bought PTLR at ath just now and at a loss now. Should I be worried? 😢
Lol theres a gay bear pissed EV isnt tanking. Downvote this and buy calls instead retard
Do you ever sometimes fart so loud and wet that you may need to buy BLNK calls
chelon❤️
It’s spelled Nio.
Xi Jinping
^ someone who’s never tried Zapps before
Buy the dips. 




AHAHAHAHAAAAHAAAA!
Why did they spike this week? Haven't been following.
This guy Bros.

Don’t do it.

>Sen. **Rick Scott** of Florida says he has tested positive for the coronavirus and is isolating at home with “very mild symptoms.” Scott is the second senator, along with Iowa’s Chuck Grassley, to announce a positive test this week.
DKNG DONE lmao
You honestly think vaccines will be distributed next month? 🤡
bad what?
So who bought at 98%?
My puts are ready. Everyone is gonna grow another arm or finger with the fake vaccine
hahhahahahaha 8k ain't shit I hope you joking
I eat none of that shit I'm buying puts
Lol you can barely find any real info for some of these EVs
[deleted]
Do people still like ciic
Why did I fomo into PLTR 🤡
Insane bull fantasy projection for the day: we retest SPY 360

Bearish dreams projection for the day: we retest SPY 354
I think they’re pretty close to equal these days, just like Honda/Toyota.  How would you rank them?
Oh what a wicked thing to do.....make me lose money with you.....
Seriously who the fuck is gambling their future away by not dumping every thing into nio?

How can anybody not see nio as the tesla of 2019/2020?
Wtf where is my daily cat polka video meme?
So everyone here has bought nio so it dumps now?
Minecraft but extremely shitty and also kind of "open source"
Zoom about to zoom out of 400 I think 🤣
yessir. Just keep moving the line forward while stowing away a portion of each gain. I'm on my fourth NIO "cycle" I just keep sliding up the strike on 1/21/23 and selling when it gets "too" in the money. Not only to you keep your gains each time (premium obviously lower when you move strike) but you also get more gain than you would've because the original options were so ITM.
[deleted]
Why ya buying PTON lmao no one got money to buy that shit without a stimi
This is a 10/10 in burgerland.
Is zm a joke to u sir
No. The vaccine for the company that's not PFE doesn't need cold transport and PFE will be localized.
Shkreli, duh
Pelosi speaking in 5 mins about the approved stim.
their dog toys are decent prices too.
That 304 bucks could cover a lot of coffee
im in, vegan power to the moooooooooooooooooooooooooon
CCL puts starting to move in the green direction. Hold strong 🐻 Cruise Gang.
Yup! Good luck!
Thanks dad I’ll get back to jerking off and giving unwarranted advice on the internet now
Sounds bullish!
If you can’t handle her lows, you don’t deserve her highs
Guys we really need to start an EV company.  Who should be the CEO?
If Li hits $40 today I will donate my left nut
What you are afraid of is what you are actually supporting.
RKT leaps if it goes below $20
Aye
It’s happening bröther
ohhh I get it, solo a canadian scooter company that generated 1 million dollars in revenue is worth 850 MILLION dollars.... im all in >=D
hmmm... thinking same but the autism in me is making me feel like watching my money go straight down
Damn nice grab brother.  I don't see her dipping next week unless the whole mkt dips. Might be a little slower pace above the 50 mark, but I could be wrong
That'll work for me, lol.
I hope NIO doesn't pull a KNDI
Waiting for that ZM dip.

Going to wait until 2, after the lunch break
Thanks to your wife's boyfriend for letting you play with us here. Nice input!
To $250...
yeah at these levels and small businesses going into the 11th inning in the next couple of months.
I’m only on Tesla for ev. Until I see import ev on US or European ground I’m watching on the sidelines. But god bless anyone who is making tendies on them right now
So far my weeklies printed but yeah be wary that stock has bounces
[deleted]
Vaccines are literally releasing in December with millions of doses. I don't know what that means for you, but trade accordingly. That's going to hit hard and fast.
I have a 495 put 11/27
You're a fucking idiot. Go lay down on the freeway and take a nap.
MM trying to get paper handed call holders to sell.
[removed]
You aren't lying. 12/18 300 only up 6%
It's gonna bounce probably. That or we are both 🤡
NIO - “dump et”
Buying dips all week😎
I need BABA to do some legal China stock shit
Deploy scheduled 11:00 dump NOW
Where’s the guy that told me to buy CIIC :(
Wverytime it hits 50 people must be loading up on puts
I disagree, they continue to grow, just digital growth is a huge opportunity for them.
In so glad I didn't fucking sell my Tesla puts. I'm gonna be rich!!
How come no one is talking about Snap anymore? 🤔
Not sure the yahoo article I read said dec1st.
Here is one more then, and it’s not fear mongering.  

US seeing unprecedented coronavirus spread, White House says https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/19/health/coronavirus-white-house-help-coming/index.html
Phase 1:  Say you're making an EV vehicle
Phase 2:
Phase 3: Watch idiots zoom your stock and profit
UAL broke 40, free fall now and look at the vol
Dammit PLTR started the day so strong.
damn bri
Say goodbye.
Someone explain Roblox to me. Is it video game legos?
BLNK has to do something to expand that float, right? 26m shares is way too volatile long term.
NVDA why have you forsaken me
SQ and BABA on a run.
Let's go, keep that momentum going. Down with travel!
I'll be interested to see how the F-150 does.  I live in Louisiana, and every guy here (except me cuz I'm not from here) drives a truck, regardless of what kind of job they have (a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much).  Anyway, it is hard to deny the most torque and horsepower of any F-150 ever.  


On the other hand, I think the Hummer EV will be as big of a flop as the previous Hummer.  I do not equate Hummer with luxury, and almost nobody is going to pay $100K+ for something non-luxurious.  Hummers are big, stupid, and obnoxious.  It's probably a stereotype, but only assholes drive them.  I just don't understand who their target market is.
Just sold solo for $500 profit. This up trend has to stop at some point. Has anyone actually googled what the vehicle looks like?
OP thinks WSB takes partial profits on rallies into economic, political, and public health tsunami? Funniest thing I’ve hear today. OPs advice is also totally sound.
I told you, im about to waste a day trade so i don't bleed another 100$.  Want me to tell you when i sell so you can buy back in? it'll go up. Watch.
Pointed the wrong way
In a normal world FE would be down like 6 percent and keep going on dual news of a potential delisting (not filing their quarterly statement) and that their exces paid someone $4M that could be illegal. 

But someone already bought the goddamn dip.
Tell that to blackrock lol

From what im reading thats the reason why they issued 100m in shares. Get funding to help comply entry into us markets🤔
I only know UTZ from mad men

Im in
Oh they're definitely scanning WSB comments to move this sucker.
i'm not crying you're crying fuck you

At this point, idk why this isn’t required by WSB
Damn NIO back to 40

Anyone else think we retest ATH before we get next leg down/pull back
Duh.

I think the key is distribution and utz is doing better every year. I read somewhere they could expand in Walmart easily and add another 150m, I believe.
I was just talking about this company last night. Utz salt and vinegar is a top contending chip. Didn't realize the potential but you might be onto something.
Now you are just contradicting yourself. Why is someone making money on the inevitable crash any worse than someone making it on the pump?

Chewy is probably going to stick around but valuation is tough.
Someone posted elsewhere that a call to vote would require institutions to give back loaned shares due to a SEC rule I guess which means the 130% will need to cover their asses

Ok, I'm upgrading it to $70 price target. Please continue with trading.
lol. As a computer engineer, you're missing a few facts:

A) The desire to switch to ARM isn't that substantial. The additional software recertification costs and time make it a non-starter. x86 isn't going anywhere.

B) AMD had/has an ARM license so they could easily switch to  ARM if for whatever reason the market changes. 

C) Nvidia's purchase of ARM is spooking many of the people do to their past licensing practices and it would give Nvidia a leg up as a competitor.

D) ARM doesn't make the chips themselves just templates and designs for other companies to license. There's a ton of work to bring a design from concept to an working chip, let alone an ecosystem for that chip as each vendor has a different I/O implementation. The chips are not interchangable.

The REAL reason Xilinx is very attractive is:

1) Embedded Revenue is a very stable market

2) Xilinx will help AMD make inroads into the ML/HPC accelerator market.

3) Xilinx has a huge presence in the 5G & Edge computing market which are really growing

4) The packaging technology is very useful for where AMD and the industry is going.

That being said. I do think AMD is a great stock to own and hold long term.

There won't be a new deal. Listen to think links. The CEO had a second asshole torn for him because he thought it would be a good idea to sell a public company to a random solicitation rather than host an auction process to determine fair market value of the company. There is a final shareholder vote in late December, and this is where they will reject the acquisition and the deal will collapse. If you add up all the ownership of each fund publicly stating that they will vote against this, it's already enough votes to kill the deal. This doesn't include those who weren't public, and retail votes.
Expected more movement on baba options tbh
That was yesterday friend. But you are still welcome aboard, we haven't closed the door yet but will be blasting off soon so hurry.
if you're interested in a gay bear position, BZUN puts. cheap contracts and ER usually moves the stock +-15-20%.
Fuck your amp links

I closed my positions to lock in gains, I think it may possibly reach 184, but it doesnt stay above 180 for very long in my experience. Suggest getting out and waiting for a better entry point (it will dip next week).
Of course. Gotta know when to bail! That's my point. Ups, downs, nothing in this market makes any sense so why try? Take profit and enjoy life! 🍺

I like to imagine that PLTR is using its own software and AI to manipulate its stock price better than any MM or Algo ever could.
It's up from $34 to $48 in a month.

Right. Your calls look good but I don't ever see this being more than a 2B company. Snack foods are such a fickle product. Everyday there's something new and cheaper
Why so many fkn down votes every comment
Can you guys take your 1.5k gains to smallstreetbets? I've saved up 8k over the past 3 summers and it doesn't help me to see how peons invest..
Stay over 50 NIO. You can do it
baozun puts before monday morning earnings. they're pretty cheap contracts and they usually move +-15-20% after earnings.

Campbell's owns Kettle brand potato chips, Goldfish, Late July tortilla, Synder's pretzels, Pop Secret, Pace salsa, Lance crackers, Pretzel Chips, and Cape Cod chips. So basically the rest of the chip aisle.

I made 110% profit on SOLO calls I bought a few days ago and I got out when it was at 10.90 just a bit ago. Not even mad that it probably could have been 200% or more. Just wish I'd bought more.
Whats anyone's thought on GMHI
Buying opportunity for KNDI? I mean can they enter US market?
Back to even for the year!  Thanks GME!
Lmao who's salty with the downvotes? Puts on baba didnt work?!?!😂
Sorry, as soon as i bought into Solo it started going down. I'm a cancer to stocks.

Am I the only one who's not dissapointed in PLTR being down? Long term this is good. You can't expect it to keep mooning every day. It needs to have some sort of sustained growth

GRVY and SE have been great rides. And of course U. Feels like this sub just overlooked U to dive into PLTR. IPO’d the same week. U is going to the moon; so, so many games run on Unity, and Epic is the only competitor. Different engines, Epic is better. But this is a duopoly in a very lucrative industry. 

U is also emphasizing ad tech to a greater degree than epic, probably because Unity has a much larger mobile user base, and mobile free to play makes good $$ from ads.

I think existing car manufacturers will have to switch their production to ev. But if the competition is already ahead they will be playing catch up.

They will then be competing with the fan boy culture.

Lol the mods won't let me post my ayro gain regardless of the title or flair but this goes through 🤨 mods are hiding ayro tendies to go in on it themselves. My call is up 40,000% no cap
Hmmmmm
Correct me if I’m wrong, but are they going to fight rivian when they go public? With backers like Amazon, you get a beast of market visibility, and no shortage of workers. Which seems to be  RIDEs biggest issue: production.

We know if Amazon is backing
Anyone else trying to short the fuck out or REGN? Would be amazing to see them below 500 next week
Suddenly my 11/27 ZM 500c doesn’t look that bad

Shhhh, don't use logic in here.
in that case you gotta switch to the pure Columbian stuff (ie futures trading)
I think so. I bought some 0dte lottos. lets get it. Amazon should be higher because of the pharmacy news.

Whoa downvote party
Ben?
Recommended PLTR to the pops. That shit is an actual buy and hold. But also though could it pop to its previous daily high again I have 0DTE bought at the low.
ZM calls were so obvious i almost doubted myself the last two days. Airline puts are still on the table not too late
Really been incredible to see how long the opportunity has been to get assets out before the dump this week.

It opened down to -7%, now it's up +20% (as of this post)

I think something else is going on here beside meme, b/c no one talks about this stock (in relation to the others) yet it's been moving like crazy w/ what is arguably a fugly car.

Meme aside, hopefully they are bought out, they make a quality and competitive eRoadster ( I want an electric Miata!) or they get a fleet contract.

I do have a position.

You guys think the feds are downvoting cause we’re to powerful?

EVs are the only way for batteries lol. Panasonic’s plant at Tesla literally produces more batteries for Tesla than the entire world’s li-ion battery use combined.

You mention all other things like it matters. If Tesla simply double in production 5000 cars a week to 10k, the entire world’s battery supply would have to double again. This isn’t even including other EV brands, which will need just as much batteries if they want to compete in the EV world. “Other electronics” that uses batteries are minuscule at this point.
Bro I had ZM 11/20 calls this morning and sold for like a 1k gain... would’ve made at least 10k if I held for literally 5 more minuties
Not to be super gay but spy is just hanging on. Ready for a elevator down.
I have no sympathy for you nio call holders 😂 talkin all that shit now you fucked
I mean share price growth.

 Ford can't suddenly have 40% higher earnings because their earnings are in the billions. But a smaller entity can have 40% more earnings quarter to quarter when that 40% is a smaller amount.
Weak.
Don’t need lifeboats when the ship is unsinkable 💪🏼

Yeah profit is profit I think it’ll keep going earnings in 2 weeks

My porfolio looks good and safe; I can go back to bed if I wish. If I do, I hope SPY goes up bigly so I can short it with confidence
should i sell my VXX calls? They aren't doing too hot today...
Anybody playing Nio leaps?
FD selling degenerates like me deserve the rope in Minecraft
Secure gains on Thursday. Buy on Friday during the sell off @ EOD. Mondays are green
Have you been to China? Do you read anything about china that's not written by the Five Eyes?

If your answer is no to both of those questions, you have zero influence and just sound like a salty whiny protrumper that's mad that he exposed our shitty admin on the global stage.

If your answer is yes to only one of them, you clearly have a lopsided bias that needs to be checked.

Either way, your words are just textbook regurgitation of a total "ra-ra-murica" with no substance or any actual impact in real life economics and global trade interactions. Better catch up or you'll be left in the dust.

Fucking EV stock on fire 🔥
The autist in me bought for the gamble. The emerging boomer in me bought for the hope of some sweet dividends. The 🌈🐻 in me is selling the covered calls.
Thx for this post. Bought 2 contracts immediately after reading this and I'm up 44% already. Fomo buy prints
Solo is an EV COMPANY with ACTUAL sales

Chill out(unless you bought FD’s) on PLTR.  It has literally done this everyday this week.  Itll come back.
The downvote bots are really killin the Friday vibe. 

PLTR is on sale btw don't say i didn't warn ya
Ah I see makes sense

Btw check ZM I yolod but exited too fast
ZM zero days⏰💣

For real though
Boeing is in the s&p now
It's never a bad idea to take any profit - if you're okay with a fat wife and a 1999 Honda Accord parked in the driveway
The photos were enough, all in
Some LinkedIn ‘yee-yee ass haircut’ trader posted about how we’re in for a massive dumping. All I’m saying is, the energy you put out is the energy you get back. The stock market is psychological. TA is for posers
Solid advice
5 dollar credit to risk 95?
fuck you  JMIA , turn +20% to -20%  in the span of a shit...
Not comparable

Yeah nobody ever regretted that.

GME going over 15 dollars next week easily
Eh it was a total cost of like $10 per call to roll them into 14c 10/27

For all you pussies thinking about selling your PLTR, remember when AMD was at $30 and crashed back to $22? Probably not because you're still in utero, but imagine how retarded you'd feel if you sold then. PLTR is gonna be $50 by next fall.
What do I guys n gals think of Telos
Wtf is that 1 year chart!  how did I miss this one
[removed]
In order to exit short positions you have to buy the shares then sell them in open market so there is a little bit of a bump and then dump.
Fuck your calls
The guy who literally grabbed the chance to destroy an entire economy while exploiting a loophole now pretends that palantir isn't moral enough for him. What a dick! What a gay bear also!
The angry 🏳️‍🌈🐻 are out in force today
Can someone just buy me some pizza I'm starving
PLTR giving you guys 1 last chance to hop on this dip before it moons. Now is your last chance!
Memes gonna meme
A lot of problems have been solved is what I will say
Let’s go Apple

How can a company with a bunch of concept cars and limited manufacturing grow faster than a company with existing facilities, a customer base, trusted brand, and years of expertise? Doesn't make sense at all.

It makes no sense that these startups have more growth potential in the EV space than BMW/Ford/GM.

Big pltr dip, easy calls
I thought this was me at first but I got fewer shares, NIO Dec 24 '20 $50 C, I'm punching myself in the face today, the fucking underlying stock is worth more than the strike price and I'm still losing money because IV crush made me pay $11.89/call.
after nvda is done consolidating, its shooting to near 580 imo
Got in ZM this morn. Already up 700$. 
Forced diamond hands no day trades left let’s go
thanks for making me feel better retard
Screenshot + WSB profit porn post = sell
lol @ clown car company Ayro.  Why is this up 50% today?
THD Calls ?
Hey Fariq, we got another sucker to invest in PLTR. We drinking hot tea today!
DISCA (Discovery Channel) is announcing a streaming service Dec 2. Calls are dirt cheap right now. Low volume though...
You are right, once I break even I'm selling.
when NIO sustains +50 today, I think my 53 and 54 0DTE calls will be nice lol
Nio bouncing off 50 support. Lookin good
CRSR is about to couple up to the retard train.
I am not selling any tsla.
im holding ez. in at 6.25
Hey at least SOLO looked more vintage and got their own style. KNDI EVs look like a 2003 Honda Fit
NIO is gonna have such strong support at 50 after this. Bulls don’t worry, this will turn out goo
Agreed. Hasn’t been confirmed yet
Is this upvoter suppression

CRSR testing 40 today book it
I think it will, but I have calls, so it's more hopium than anything.  I'm hoping there will be a fairly-typical late day, 100$ face ripper today.  Volume today is \~30% of its average daily, so nobody's trading it right now.  It's just floating in space waiting for someone to make a move.
Will someone please chop these diamond hands off of me?

Bag holding moron
Bought mgm 27p.
Totally agree. Vegas may be officially locked down again. Last time mgm dropped to 15 on that news.
Many hotels are closed mid week. The only revenue is from gaming as everything else is closed. No conventions. Etc.
Technical analysis or a more simpler approach?
Dump eeeet
If shorts exit, shouldn’t it drop the stock? I thought if more shorts entered, it can go up due to short squeezes
Where did you get that onesie?? I need itttt!
why boeing? Any technicals or news
I dont have looney syrups to trade for canadian puts tho
Tired of seeing Munchkin's ugly ass grill on my news
That’s pretty risky, this company could disappear completely a year from now. I would just try to ride the short term wave.
I bet most the people on here trading FCEL think its EV related & not what it actually is: a company that never turned a profit, has outdated tech from back in the 90's & will not turn a projected profit til 2025....

No one here is invested in GME to make some chump change of 40%. We in to be part of the greatest short squeeze in history
The circuit breaker is coming Monday. Prove me wrong
Come on ZM!
Which one would you suggest? I think Christmas and new lockdowns will do wonders for them but I'm not sure when wall street will price that into the stock, when will number become public
congrats bro
The fact that this many gay bears are downvoting out of frustration gets me off so fucking hard. Omg I’m literally getting off to their sad little mistakes it’s become more than just gratifying to see them fail for not listening it’s become sexually gratifying ohhhhhhh yesssssss bear tears are the best lube
I wouldn’t do that yet.
I don't know I'm here for you retards to tell me how to manage my money
My same thoughts, this is all smoke and mirrors to screw over 500c’s
I think it might be a bit more today
They already created that twice this year
This what you call pain for all PLTR calls
imagine being this dumb

why is @deitaone always yelling ?
I agree. Just sold my long TSLA today. I think their long term potential is still insanely high but the short term is getting a kinda iffy. Most of their long term stuff won’t happen for at least another 10-14 months.

Short term, I think it’s irrationally high. Maybe it’ll stay irrational until the long term prospects hit, and I lose out on some gains. But it’s not a risk I’m willing to take.

why tho

Yo wtf Tesla

What’s with the downvotes? I guess someone is losing money 😂.

Should expect my downvote in a sec or two😂
I can’t believe I’m enabling you. Go to YouTube and search “In the Money”. The top video will be his introduction to options trading. It’s 71 minutes long, but watch it at least twice.
Volume is \~30% of its daily average, so far.  It almost seems like everyone is waiting to see what's going to happen.
Honestly feel bad for these ppl, and how shitty their lives must actually be
I love when this places screams ITS DEAD when a company goes down 1 percent
I saw that. I was thinking it has to be shorts exiting . Who is buying right now ?
And you have my bow
Gme was up 7% for once today actually lmfao
No, no one ever talks about me
Bought PLTR calls and shares at $19, I hope I don't regret this...
WWR might meme once we rotate
Has anyone actually looked at how the KNDI’s EVs look like on their website? They look awful. We really trading this ugly ass shit?
Massive bull trap, even TSLA's unable to break the 500 barrier convincingly, we are looking at an incoming dump
that's more than 0
WTF is wrong with NIO, I’m right behind you you can blow past 50 I know itrrr
I was promised TSLA at $550
January $30 calls are going to print

Don’t talk about your wife’s boyfriend like that! Sounds like you’re the beta now.
Someone is really trying to tank PLTR or what
*And
If retail has shown me anything lately it’s that those types of moves are already priced in.  Look at BABAs massive Singles Day numbers - absolutely crushed Black Friday and yet it was a total flop for the stock.  Don’t get me wrong I’m bullish for ya but I’m not buying it at these levels.

No
>this profit comes from shareholders who sell covered calls

So in your words the shareholders are the ones fucking it up by selling calls. If they didn't see calls then there wouldn't be any weekly calls to buy. 

If you're worried about people selling and reducing the price, what is your strategy for the lock up expiration of 80% of the total shares floated? Are you predicting a massive price drop
FUCK
People who buy PLTR automatically become a shill.
Just buying a ton of leaps just below the current price. Literally nothing can go wrong with this stock
Wtf rocket
This is gonna get deleted too 0/7
LOCKDOWNS!
Is there beef?
PFE is a garbage boomer only good for swing trading .
This is definitely not the way

You're not wrong. Non-electric new energy vehicles are speculative RN.
Freud had this theory that fetishes were born in the first moment we realized we were unlike women, usually a moment with our mother, when we were young. In that moment, if she was in long socks, you like long socks. You saw her bush? You like bush. Etc. This, like most of Freud, is total bullshit.

But I have to say, my very first day trading, I watched SPY take an enormous shit—and profited from it—and it’s been my fetish ever since.
I don't think you should be in a rush to buy now but have cash ready

Amazon has 10k rivian vans ordered for dec 21. Same as Arrival for UPS. I think Rivian ends up with the US market and Arrival is able to pull some commercial market in EU especially with the UKs push to make public trans EV. Makes sense for them to go with a hometown startup and a cheaper option (supposedly)

Shut your whore mouth.
You mean someone who owns weeklies. Shorts is a negative position where you borrow shares from your broker but have to buy back the shares evantually (hopefully for a lower price).

A weekly holder can make 1000% profit, and this profit comes from shareholders who sell covered calls. Say you own stock ABC at $100, and you sell a covered call strike $150 for a dollar. If it mooned to $200, you miss out on the extra $50 for the dollar premium. The call buyer gets 50x return. And the shares gets SOLD in the market after exercising the option, thereby LOWERING the share price.

A long holder sticks with the stock through good and bad. A long holder will not sell, thus there are lesser sellers and the price would not be pushed so much down. The more long sellers there are, the more they help each other by reducing the available stock for selling, pushing up prices. 

Long holders can also lend their stock to the broker for short sellers. The more lend to short sellers, the more short sellers are able to short. Combined with long holders tendency to not sell, would reduce the drop in price, and hopefully make the short seller cover higher at a loss, pushing up price. 

Tldr: Short holder take big gains at the expense of long holders to sell open on market, reducing price. Long holder cumulatively reduce shares available for selling, raising prices.
 It's insane that SOLO has almost the same market cap as $FSR, when $FSR is going to be wildly successful with a normal car...I'm long on both, still think this is crazy.
Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. Fool me three times and I'm a fucking retard, all in baby. Trying to get my wife back from her bf.

PLTR 😁
solo but its moooning
Baba gang
If you look at pltr, they are getting closer and closer to breaking a profit. Once they do, stock will continue to rise. They will also become a s&p 500 like tesla a few days ago. If you bought 115k worth around 20/share, you would get approximately 5750 shares. Let’s say PLTR goes to, for example’s sake, 520/share. That’s 2.875 million. Long term plays man this is not a quick buck and I wouldn’t touch options with a stick.

Also gov’t backed and this technology will only become more advanced and population of western countries will continue to rise, making tech more prominent

270 isn't far out of the money. I'm poor as fuck so I'm playing 380c 2/19/21. Trying to get out of them when I break even so I can get some better contracts. Bought them pretty far back and when we dipped I was having to average down a lot. Only down $20 at this point so I'm close to exiting the position.
Yeah no shit. I meant the sub just pumping it nonstop

Lol showing a guy I work for some basics about options and his wife randomly checks her stocks and found out the $400 worth of Tesla she bought forever ago is worth 10k now
Where's my ETSY gang at
I prefer the downvote environment
Apple is becoming a boomer stock. Boring
Sbe served me well, just mad I pussed out and sold yesterday and instead of holding out a little longer. This pending merger got me nervous though
Im a perma bull but yes

*G.I. Joe*
yea what we thinking when do we sell it is it gonna hit 15?
Great because daddy wants to sell these 11/27 calls for 50% profit and I need to see it hit around 19.50 again for that to happen
Not this time 😎

I went all in and bought quite a lot at the bottom at $253.30. I'm holding like 495 @ $269 average price and 23 x 270c 2/12 @ $17.70 average price
Pretty big. While Lidar may not be needed according to Elon, that doesn’t mean it’s not incredibly useful
oh look, a tough guy
I got out ahead. Sold like 80% of shares at 17.8 and rest at market around 17. Bought at 16.48 so... cool! Stonks
Bears it’s time for hibernation in your rainbow cave. It’s bull season now.
Can’t wait for shitcoin to go to zero. You are a fool if you think you’ve “invested” in shitcoin.
They’ve only been a company for a month a SPAC for more than a month that’s why 6 month looks like that.
Rotate your phone 180 degrees. Looks stable
PLTR if not $20 today, it will be next week, why would you dont buy the dip? do you hate money?
Boooys I bought into PLTR! Get ready for it to go down!!!
TSLA dump to $480
look at its competitors

**AUTIST SURVEY. Do you like to make tendies on calls or puts more?**
FOMO
Take profits in ayro now?
I literally sold a 12/18 5.5c for 4.00 because I set a sell to order at 100% gain and forgot about it. I need to start using stop losses on these rockets. What the fuck was I thinking?
Aapl is a boomer stock now

Short squeeze GME rn, GET IN
This is the way.
Except when it's worth more than USD...
Seems unlikely! I’m not sure of what to do
Ya. It lost 150b market cap because everyone was freaking out about Ant Group. And then made half of that money back in a week, 75b.
downvote bot going to war... or is it bears?
Should I buy some 12.5 Jan calls? Yall believe it'll get up to that by then?
My coworker is 300K gains from NIO. Fuck me for not listening back in January.
ICLN is the cheapest it’s ever going to be.
What is the fullname, cant find it even a retard can find it
They have been for years though and yet they still continued to rise. Maybe this is the top, I’m thinking of selling
Yep I still believe it’s gonna keep going, but I had to lock in those profits.
I think you can do covered calls with a level 1 in a Roth IRA with fidelity, but can't use margin so no naked calls.
You want me to warm up the honey mussy in the oven?
I need you guys to buy draftkings calls to save my weekly
You can’t take it down.

V shaped recovery for SBE. I hope you guys bought the dip. This shit is mooning on the chargepoint hype
HULk is BACK
Corsair makes some of the best internal parts. Logitech is more focused on mice and keyboards. Corsair also sponsors a lot of big gamers so they have a ton of exposure.

Women stuck at home picking up hobbies and trying to make money selling handmade stuff online. Which is a demographic that’s seen a sharp increase since lockdowns happened, because women tend to hold more of the jobs that were first on the chopping block.
Bottom is in?
Everyone stayed home... forced or not they stayed home
Stem cell injections? To where and why? That does not sound medically accurate at all.
You gotta be at least 6 years old before they let you lie about your age and options trading experience to get an account.
I was trying to roll forward some contracts and TDA was rejecting my orders saying my limit was too high (like i was paying too much) compared to the market price. 

So i used the market price to place the order and it did it at four times the amount i was putting in and spent more money than is in the account somehow. Classic.
Bears who hate money
Wet pussy or wet body from tieing a cinder block to your feet and Yolo off the bridge
no. me like tendies.
ban this copy paste fucker
SPY recovering!
I remember those days! I got up to $80 a share, phoned my broker to sell because I bought at virtually nothing, he ignored the order, and never sold. Then he wiped out my account trying to "win" back the money.

Ah, the days before automated brokers!
This is the way.
AYRO, holy shit. Whose big swinging dick got in even earlier and heavier than I did?
zm calls was the move ahah. Hearing about Pfizer and possibly Moderna to file their vaccine  for emergency use, I'm scared to hold these calls over the weekend. Although there's an earnings runup, it could go sideways.
Obviously removed for no info - but it’s a good idea
Yeah but the resistance is quite strong tbh
The BABA train heading to $320 is ready to depart from platform 6
I'll do it, if you can prove to me why PLTR will make me a multi millionaire. give me that DD.
someone must be mad salty at the market
CRSR is literally free money and it’s not stopping anytime soon. So undervalued and the company is just fucking awesome in general. Been buying their shit for years.

That feeling when your 2021 calls are in the money already, two days after buying.  Gunna put those diamond hands to the test. 

Thanks SOLO!
Is there any reason not to IPO in this day and age? If you are a successful company (like corsair) it's easy money. If you are an unsuccessful company (like Nikola) it's also easy money. I know the term "IPO bubble" gets thrown around but damn.

Why would you buy it now when Trump is giving a press conference at noon? The only way it would be at noon is if it's extremely bullish. I think we retrace about 5% from highs next week but entering a position before you see what this press conference is about is retarded.

PLTR is perfect. Goes up, tendies. Goes down, load up for more future tendies. Rinse and repeat.
Maybe this is a stupid question, but if I knew a lot about investing I wouldn’t be on this sub. When you buy stock in American companies, can you buy that directly with Canuck bucks, or do you have to convert it to USD first?

My favorite pastime is buying calls, holding them through to -70% and then watching it run all the way back up to even and selling.

What are your positions?
Sold my SPWR calls yesterday for a $20 gain, even though a not-so-quiet voice in my head was telling me to hold it, stupid
right, smooth transition into an authoritarian regime

won't happen we're still america
Ok, honest question, how can it possibly be that China literally extinguished the virus from a country of 1+ billion but Europe and the US are still balls deep? Something doesn’t add up.
Yeah but they’re still down

If 356 goes I think we see a test of 354.70. and if THAT goes we could see a huge sell off

Is this white Kanye?
This is the way
Bless bro
just took my last hit until the new year
1. trade less. Do moves that you see actualizing in a few days at least.
2. don't do market orders unless its on something under the Penny Pilot Program (i.e. single penny bid-ask point changes as opposed to the $5 or $10 multiples for pricing).
3. Your position is going to always start at a loss unless you somehow got lucky and had an order filled at the ask price instead of somewhere near the midpoint. Algos will beat you to it 99.99% of the time so its not worth trying to hit this.
Just throw it all into spy
Crazy high volume of downvotes being tossed around
Small pp boys
the reason I'm actually up is because I stopped listening to WSB
It’s strange because, on paper, I can’t think of any reason to sell AMZN. They are booming in the post-pandemic world and, even after the recovery, will continue to grow, but still the stock is trickling down. 

I guess indicative of the wider market sentiment more than the company’s prospects themselves?
Damn I sold out of SFM puts too early. I could have had bigly gains if I held overnight

Thanks, I'll look checkout the library

> Finding the tiktok logo will probably actually take an off the shelf neural network and some training

For a 2d fixed image they can probably resort to training on simple templates with some kind of adaptive algorithm as the logo isn't a 3D object that present differently from different angles of rotation. You'd really just have variation in scale, color and maybe contrast. 

But tbh I don't think it's a great idea to ban tiktok posts. It could really become a thing among professionals and then WSB would look like a bunch of reactionary MySpace > Facebook types
It doesn’t have to hit the strike to make money, retard.
What are you talking about guys? WE ARE MOONING!!!  
SBE, GME, RIDE! Nio & pltr not bad either.

So many options at that strike, we gonna hug 500 all day. I have a shit ton of 0dte at striks above tho, could see movement if we get far enough away
This BLNK run is just absolutely fucking insane. Even worse is I had originally gotten in at 0.8 for 12/18 15c and sold them when they hit 0.7 the next day because I have shitty stop losses, then that same day they 3x'd, then the next several days did multiple 15% up days. Those calls would have gotten me ten thousand dollars if I had held until today. Fuck me.
Trying to decide if I should sit here and watch myself become poor in real time, paralyzed with inaction, or just leave for a few hours and come back later to crushing despair.

Probably data mined your comments and decided to dump. Oh the irony
Ah yes, the ascending Dorito pattern. If it continues this pattern we might see an upward glizzy form that would take the price to about $23.16. If we do not hit the upward glizzy, expect to trade in a slithering snake pattern for awhile. You can tell it’s a slithering snake pattern because the stock will navigate between going up and down
Where’s the lie?

anybody remember the day First Energy (FE) dropped REALLY hard in the morning, and then rallied like 15% by the afternoon? I made a killing that day. Today is the first time I've seen FE on the big board of losers, down 5% and falling.
I remember when I wanted a Velodyne Subwoofer.
I love how baba goes up by 5 points. But I’m in such a deep hole that I’m still down 98%
No chance Tesla closes above 500 today. You really think they'd let all those 11/20 500 calls get off that easy? Wait a week or two then hop back in before the massive squeeze leading up to 12/21
Gimme 3 reasons to buy pltr and ill buy

welcome to the top sir
Hey! CIIC has 10K vehicles to deliver the end of 2021. That’s the same as Rivian! Cant go tits up! Right!? /s
You know we are in a bubble when a car company that delivered 12K cars in a quarter is worth 50B Dollars
Example of why SPACs can suck balls.  GRAF had NO lockout period post merger for PIPE shareholders to unload. This crashed from about $30 to $12 post-merger because of an onslaught of PIPE shares that got unloaded.  It appears to be over now, so it may be a good re-entry, but there was a ton of pain for SPAC bagholders who still are probably in the red.  This is a warning for you CIIC chasers.  Don't baghold a SPAC.  PIPE holders can fuck you hard.

I got my NIO shares called away at 46 but I’m holding a 46 call expiring 12/11. Should I wheel the next two weeks with the money?

We now have $500b for immediate use for a stimulus bill even if it’s something small to keep us going until January. That’s what Mnuchin Meadows and Schumer will be discussing this morning. We should get news about that by early afternoon. Hold onto your calls! We’ll hit 360 today.
More like liDurrrr
That’s a large claim sir
Hope you’re talking about MK1-3 and not anything else
I didnt see any post other than tesla nio crsr pltr over and over and over...
I think I hit a plateau in the last couple of months, need to take another break

130k -> 100k -> 120k -> 100k -> 125k -> 115k

was in my best shape yet up 125k, no positions, and I fucked it up last week, losing 10k, and yeah I need to take a break. I'm going no where in the long run right now.

ABNB strikes me as the bigger name service that will grab a decent bit of initial hype, then drop for a while due to covid. Buy the dip friend.

&#x200B;

If anything, sell Puts right at offering as somewhat of a limit buy point... if it rockets, you can buy to close ezpz, if not well its your limit buy point and you get some premium. Should have fairly high IV as well at the start.
10 weekly calls on baba bought here we go
I hit over 20k one time and came back down . If this not the fucking hardest ceiling to break, idk what is . Got dammit
OK guys we're really close to the top.. this must be it 

Got 2 calls from buddies today that want to buy in, stonks and the coin
Contracts. Not contacts. I'm silly
PLTR RED, I REPEAT PLTR IS RED, ABANDON SHIP

There is: Xpeng, Nio,, li, Tesla, ayro.

AYRO lurching around like a drunk toddler the last 30 minutes. Some thoughts:

Pro: this thing would need to be over 30 to even match SOLOs market cap. Tons of room to run. 

Con: ownership could do another offering any day and kill the price.
FCEL in beast mode. Hope to see this following BLNK

Lol I can’t believe idiots are still buying solo. Fuck the EV market. This is some bullshit...
Finally can get my hands on SNAP puts again
To elaborate: The squeeze topped out when it got slapped down instantly on touching $6 twice yesterday. Today is going to be a mini-squeeze as options get exercised, and then interest in the stock is going to drop through the floor for a couple weeks.
Should I sell my NAKD at a loss or hold ...

You realize Moderna updated their formula and don't need special sub zero medical freezers? DRY ICE is a non-issue.  PFE's vaccine will be localized or distributed to locations capable of its storage requirements while Moderna will most likely be shipped by air.  Distribution will most likely be done by military and possibly subcontracted to freight assuming their cargo can house the commerical fridges/freezers.

Tanked within fucking seconds. Jesus fucking Christ.
Call. Spy calls usually print on monday
Stop you’re scaring it back down
ZM doing Zoom things. On its way back to 500
CRSR single handedly saving my entire acct
RKT is mortage lending, I.e. challenging traditional big banks MM, theyve pumped and dump this ticker before because they have the power to.

PLTR isnt fighting against MM, they help commercial enterprise including financial customers to save or make more money. 2 of Palantir founders are billionaires who have other portfolios including being a PayPal cofounder. Unlikely for this to be pump and dump like RKT
What rally
PLTR is going to explode in the next few weeks alone. The UK is about to pump billions into the military - the biggest surge in defence investment since the 80s - and it's all focused on AI and Cyber. You can bet they're gonna want some of Palantir's sweet, fresh, young and perky ass.
Am i wrong?
i believe in u bb
Remember thinking THIS MORNING that the market was gonna moon today?
ZOOM shares/january calls, VXX 20 calls december, all in on these, thank me for lambo later

call or put
my contracts were moving big yesterday with every bump, but today they aren't reacting the same. Flat from close yesterday to now. I'm way OTM but with Feb exp that shouldn't be a huge factor.
Is it worth it buying this massive KNDI dip? Is this just profit taking or any big news on it?

Yo fuck RH. Not allowing weeklies for crsr calls. Closest out is 12/18
Looks like it. We’ll see, looks like people are buying spreads on it in prep for the rest of the day and probably will sell the opposing contracts near the end of the day when we have an idea of what Monday will look like.
u/StevenVanMetre I disagree that we are set up for a drop right now. To me it looks like the market is in **wait-and-see mode** pending the outcome of the US election. A divided government was seen as generally good for market stability, so the market went up to the previous high spurred by hopeful vaccine news. However, like you point out, the market repeatedly cannot break away from that high. We have been in a sideways channel since about September 2, 2020. The market broke above the prior high (3580 for SPX) in November, but now is retesting the high, currently slightly below it. It appears to still be resistance and not support. Also, we are still significantly above the 10 month SMA.

If SPX goes below 3200, then I agree with you, we will be having a decent drop. However, one somewhat reliable indicator, the 10yr-2yr fed treasury difference already was positive and confirmed with the COVID drop in March. If that COVID drop was actually not confirmation (because it was artificially induced), then the real drop could be coming in 2021. We are currently 14 months away from the bottom of the negative 10yr-2yr difference. Generally the confirmations are 6 to 18 months away, and we did have one, unless it was false of course.

Just one week, when I was 27. My roommate at the time begged me to go get lunch with her at this bar down the road. I said okay.

MM heard you talking shit
Tsla *hates* 500
Been staring at this for 2 weeks only to not pull the trigger lol
Fuck off im down $150
What's the difference between someone who holds short vs someone who holds long? They both take profit

The short holder only earns a a few percent profit and the long holder earns hundreds of percent profit, doesn't that mean the long holder is taking more money for a smaller initial investment?

What exactly is the long holder giving?
Fuck'd if I know, I was up bigly and now I'm thinking ill be lucky get away even, lol
Let’s be honest most of us would try doubling it and losing it
CRSR GANG FUCKS
Wtf is wrong PLTR? What a fucking retard meme stock
What we think aout BLNK
Impressive.  A first year options trader who got into because of WSB learned the important lesson on not buying dumbass FDs.  This is the way to go - buy contracts roughly 45-120 DTE.  Sell with about a month of time left and move on to new ones another 45-120 DTE. Yeah, you don't get that rush of seeing it blow up 400% in a single day , but it's way less riskier than stupid FDs that lose all value in 2 days.
You’re gay.
CCL put bros, we holding? Drill at 17?

Don't judge me
I got a weekly and 10 shares
It's not bro it's volatile as fuck. Set your price target. It's still .40 up since open. If you can keep your pants on, get in on one of these crazy ads dips and ride the volatility coaster. I got in a few weeks ago and if I wasn't up like this I'd probably get out because this shit is violent
Buying 1k spy weeklies EOD what could go wrong
There is no certainty truly, these fucking monstrosities can do anything they want. Be safe weary traveler
Go SOLO

Thought PLTR was about to hit $20. I used a trailing stop loss for a change...and wow did that help.

They can probably include real coronaviruses in that due to the current coronavirus surplus.
I exited today because I don't see it breaking 96 in the short term and idk if Donny T will do something catastrophically spiteful or not
Yup just did right at peak. Sold half but thankfully executed on time 🤠

Stating the obvious, this is not going to be a green day for SPY
its crazy that the market has gone so flat that a 0.1% SPY drop seems nutty

I miss the days of drilling 2% at open

Pltr has been on the market for a month I don’t think it counts as classic yet?
Yea, I felt like a dummy for not knowing. And then I went on to watch the movie last night!

Imagine not buying that dip
picked up 100 shares of BLNK. just gonna forget about that one for a few years.
Through a friend of a friend, my first gig was making sure a crate got on a truck (which I assume was the build). Then these guys called me and pleaded me to shoot the reveal because their other guy was unavailable, They overnighted me a new iPhone and emailed me a shooting guide. I showed up, set up a google home dialed in Tool Time Tim, and recorded the reveal, then asked some interview questions. I mailed the Iphone back and collected my tendies. Gonna have a producer credit on the show lol.
🪓 and my axe!
Trying to diamond hand some January $75/$70 calls
FUV dipping on offering.  Smart biz acumen if they use those funds to secure their distribution, etc.  may be a good dip to buy.
Are there actual downvote bots in here or what?
I am loving these mass downvoters. Thanks for putting in the time soliders.
It's already been squeezed and now all of the boomer investment sites are saying it's a sell. People are going to start dumping it, and institutions will just pick it up on the dips and hold until it starts making news again.
CRSR break $40 already
PLTR dumping for the 3rd time in 40 minutes. Why do I even watch?
How many times have you all sh*t yourself in your adult life?

I know. I’m hoping to see $15 in the next few weeks. Next week will be scary but, I could make some good money if Burry decides to call someone a pedo on twitter or Lil Yachty announces a concert at a GameStop somewhere or something

GME is up 83 cents today so far so I’m feeling alright
So uhhhh inverse this guy 👆🏻

Just realized what you said. Wouldnt bet on myself either
Stop playing TSLA, we know you’re overvalued and bloated to explode downwards

The mms take our money
I know why you got puts. I would’ve got them too. But I invested myself.
Portfolio is up 16% this week :0 just wish I had more money to invest, I'm on a roll. PLTR, GE, CHWY, BE, SPWR, CROX and CIICU
I’m starting to think everyone on wsb is Canadian pretending to be American
NIO's going to $52 today boi. Hold on to them FD's

SE deez gains
SPY is ass fucking PLTR
Sold my ZM calls so I can go back to sleep... still awake watching it rip up :/
This is actually your best bet OP. I warmly suggest you follow this advice.
a wedge of cash?
You don’t deserve PLTR’s chocolatey goodness.
At IPO I bought 1000 shares at $10 then day 3 I bought 10 options 10c 5/21.
It’s crashing from their POV cause they bought at the top that day
Wow GameStop announcing good news we’re gonna see some movement. Lets go!!!!
He’s hogging all the tendies for himself, hop on YouTube and spend a couple days gathering the concept & understanding Greeks. Then go make money n tell your accountant friend to kick rocks
The downvote gremlins have multiplied Lmfaooo
AMD is the bounciest stock I swear
But have you heard of network effects
That's the best advice you'll get.
LMAO at anybody who sold Corsair at the bottom
This meme euphoria with red/flat indices is really...something lol. Be exceedingly careful meme boys
SPAC stocks are even worse!

He funds those orgs though? Tf are they gonna do? Tell him not to give them anymore free money?
Who has $20 pltr weekly lmao

NET, why I sold call too early? 😭
BLNK is ripping
NIO put?  little out of the money call or put on spy/qqq?
It's dumping hard :(
Wise words
Serial downvoter is starting early today.
TGT just popped 174. Ain't stopping. 200 by March you heard it here first. Pile on in.

Also for a more boring stock look at Alcoa (AA). Made a few comments about it last month and I hope people made money with it. Aluminum market rebounding from 2020 lows. 2020 aluminum outlook was already bad pre-COVID. As we come out of COVID and manufacturing (homes, cars, planes) recovers, the aluminium market/price recovers expect AA to get back to the 20s and maybe push for the 40s from 2018. They had a 'meh' earnings in October and gave bad guidance for this quarter but here we are up 50% on the month.

Exciting? No. Tendies to be made? Yep. Figure any strikes for 20+ in April 2021 and beyond is just free money.
I’m bow hunting Whitetails in Iowa and trading memes on my phone.  What a time to be alive.
Fuck yeah
Loaded SPY and SOLO puts, RIOT and BABA calls. Let’s do it.

They do this to steal IP from investors and do run off companies with free RND. Isnt the CEO of NIO known for it? China protect.
If only they had debuted Beyond Bat :(
CB confirmed
PLTR 20 EOD?
Yes. So I can buy in
The December calls are a bit risky, Jan calls seem good tho. Might want to roll out the December calls to a later expiration, April is the safest bet
Probably some loser with PLTR puts
TSLA isn’t going up:(
Congrats and fuck you
Why would it need to charge for a drop off?

Just saying that's the reason it didn't dump harder, still speculations going on
BABA got up above 270 shortly after the regulatory news dropped btw. Definitely room to run back there now that everyone has digested it.

my KNDI 15c are kicking my ass rn
It’s not even back to its ipo price after getting hit by a short piece. The short piece said that gp would not be able to secure orders cause it relies on vouchers too much and doubt that they will ever become feasible as a business without it. However, gp was able to secure 100 more ev stars without vouchers and 16 more school buses on top. They are expecting the production capacity to push them over the tip where they can become profitable without vouchers soon.

Yes sir
My company gave us a stipend for setting up a home office. It was relatively small ($300), but I’ve heard of companies that would offer a $1500 stipend (this was pre-pandemic). At least in my industry (software), you’re issued a laptop.  It’s pretty sweet.

Smart companies will start offering stipends, especially if it helps them save on costs for physical space. I’m fairly certain that the price per person of setting up a home office is insanely cheap compared to leasing a physical office space and setting it up for employees.
$340 by EOD 🤑🤑🤑
90% of my plays go the opposite way within seconds of buying. Different times of the day, different companies. Anyone know a way around this?
fuck fuck FUCK THIS KANGAROO SHIT AGAIN

I was in the middle of buying the NKLA shares in small blocks as the price was going down, robinhood executes a buy for the remaining shares right before it dropped like 22 mins into trading. I call bullshit since I still had my long leg and no margin.

If we break the resistence at 13 for GME the bears will be fuk
there must be a better DD than that lmao
My option is up 112%
This weeks resistance is \~3,080/90. For me it's a buy right now with Black Friday and the holiday season coming up.

Reeeeeeeeeee
We are going to Uranus
Everyone who was going to sell sold during that opening dump, now its buy buy buy all day like its the backstreet boys
Thinking about buying some PLUG leaps. Is it a good time to do that after a stock offering?
[deleted]
My calls are losing money and my puts are losing money. And that’s something COVID can never take away from me.
I doubt it
I mean that would be like a 20 something % drop
Im with you

Not many activities
When did you get on the PLTR train?
Yeah fuck this, sold the one good ticker I had and threw money into the other 2 worse tickers. Puts on my mental health.
shill some drills
PLTR and it won’t be under $20 for long
Can someone reassure me that PLTR is not going to be another DGLY pump and dump?

Flatter than my ex girlfriends titties

God I miss that bitch

Cheap price. Fuck it, I’m in.
In 3ish days when the funds don't clear they will revoke your instant deposit ability's and set your cash balance at -100. hopefully your play is profitable and you can sell it to cover the negative or just come up with 100 in the next couple days.
FUCK THE DOWNVOTERS SALTY ASS BEAR BITCHES. REPEAT AFTER ME
Yeah I sold off at $254.44. Congrats and fuck you
The SPY is charging up to unleash full-throttle maximum gayness
Start trading them, stop gambling them
#HELLO DOWNVOTER U MAD ? KKKKKKKKKK
yikes crsr
Is there an actual reason for that? (I’m currently holding it)
After not having my order filled with the price sitting below my limit buy for a good 30 seconds I can’t even cancel my order now...

It’s going down! Crash incoming.
bitch fuck u
calls on CRSR are literally free money 😎
i bought net for a swing jan 21
YESS BABA UR HULK COCK
Hey, wait a minute. This is just all speculation. You fucks sounded like you knew what you were talking about.
Wow this mainstream market is so emotional and cringe can barely take it anymore. Meanwhile memes and coins go up 4-5% a day.
SELL MY CALLS NOW OR WAIT FOR THE RISE?
What you buy on?
Can we do automatic bans for people who post wolf of wall street clips?
You really think this is a better sub to ask instead of r/options? 

Make sure to post your loss porn on your way out.
Whoever the retard was that mentioned Short bus Energy, my calls thank you.
Thanks alot

AYRO is definitely the swing ▶️
Vanilla icecream is the best icecream.
There are a ton of articles, youtube videos, and just discussions available to learn how to trade options.

I didn't do that.  I learned by losing a ton of money.
buy **RIOT**
ah i've seen this movie before, PLTR $21 by close
Don’t talk to daddy like that
Should I hold my TSLA 11/27 $525c?

Don't know what next week hold with Thanksgiving coming up.
Up 1$ on my spy put gonna have to secure profits

I always go through the unusual options activity after the markets closed for the day and yesterday there was Mad heavy volume for 6c 12/4/20, 6.5c 11/27/20, 7c 12/4/20 COTY calls. Whales wouldn't be buying contracts in the thousands if they thought it would lose lol
Why does Jack Dorsey look like he's been stuck on an abandoned island all year? Wtf is up with these billionaire guys, they're weird as fuck.
Downvote and move on
COTY
Buy PLTR
This explains my bear tendencies.
GME next leg up here
My mom doesn't make significant plays on a weekly basis. Marking-changing news doesn't happen that frequently.
I was just thinking this, like it’s been nonstop who knows when this will end, and which companies will go and which won’t? Pretty easy answer which will thrive so shorting Xpeng sounds like baby profits.

CRSR dip
If Citron hadn’t pulled their gay bear bullshit then NIO would be at 60+ right now. Blame them.

Munchkin realizing what a fucking turd he dropped ok the market yesterday and frantically trying to scoop it back up.

Today is brought to you by Kang Gang 🦘🦘🦘
Are we thinking market opens deep red monday? debating if i should take my 30% profits or leave on the table? 

Last 2 mondays were big green days sooo opposite?
Crsr dip??
[deleted]
Pharmaceutical company that uses technological equipment on their patients that also have other services. Great buy especially while they’re on this huge dip right now. I don’t know why more people aren’t getting into this. It’s a cash crop for easy money
Red 3 reporting in.
No, I just liked opiates and bought a lot of dilaudids online because it was hard to find them on the street...

Then I discovered heroin and it was even easier to get than mail order drugs and, at the time, Bit coin wasn't shit and I didn't really think of it because I was too focused on staying well and the dope game...and here we are, playing $20,000 slots on the S&P 500.
Market red dxy green
I thought I was averaging buying dips but IV was whacking it 2 days ago, hard. Watched it melt up and realized I didn’t pay attention. I’ll be fine though.
Shill me on something under 20
Buy power fading
Happy birthday bro, get them fuckin tendies
Why only 100
All eyes on BABA
First time CRSR has been down all week.
SBE is lit
Friggin BABA trading at 1.6% up instead of the juicy 4% up in Hong Kong.  Gyna actually has a brain unlike us Ameripoors.
Rise PTON! RISEEEEE!!!!
Xpeng is the daddy now
People like round numbers.

If PLTR breaks 21, it will quickly head to 25.

If NIO breaks 51, it will quickly head to 75.
I just want to know what motivates the downvoters

Yes
I think by January we’ll be $350+
None, diamond handing this crap till 2050... Personal opinion is I do not like paper handed cunts who take profit without contributing anything back, and weekly call holders screwing covered call sellers who are in it for the long run. Both take without giving and should be eliminated or punished by making them fomo buy at top sell at bottom.
Fraud allegation got refuted

Those green dildos on BABA, so satisfying.

Kind of late on XPEV for huge short term gains but still a good investment.
Beautiful baba
Good. Good. Dip just far enough to make me panic sell my calls.
Give up
How are you down? Its gone from $16 up to $19 in a week
Yep
Imagine being a bitter retard and focusing on downvoting instead of getting better at trading
Riot calls
Hell yea
Next year the dump
Don't know how to comment on DXY situation. Shit's been retarded AF for the past month
Best part about having PLTR shares bought at 15 is being able to watch this rollercoaster without worrying. Because it's not going below 15 anymore. Right?
Guys?
? and some gaming hardware accessories. Still dont get it
Stocks seem better
username doesn't match
That’s how you make profit on stonks. You get on a bubble before everyone else. Right now PLTR is a bubble in a making and the airbrb - assuming post covid (with vaccine). Although I have to say that NIO’s vehicles look great inside and out and EVs in general are much easier to develop and manufacture than boomer cars. Less maintenance too. Makes sense for the world to convert
I bought some BLNK shares. been wanting to get into EV somehow but won't put my money into China and tsla already overvalued
BABA making some moves
Blue skys are coming
I don't think working out at home is a fad. and I'm old enough to remember when people thought Facebook was a joke too. time will tell
If AMWL can close above $25, or ideally $25.30 that would be a nice new base for a big run next week from my limited understanding of magic lines.
Fk yea I'm coming back!
That's why I'll have the more expensive lambo
*yelling up from basement* 

Mom, someone is downvoting me again on wallstreetbets.. make them stop!
where that 600c tsla guy at
What should I use my one day trade on today
This is the way
TWLO clawing back up to the top.  Getting DEC 20 $300 calls
I am once again asking RKT to stop being garbage.
Things I was thinking when I got AAPL

Lmao, everybody sleeping on NKLA.

PLTR not going below $19
Thoughts on NET LEAPs? looking at 07/16/2021 80c
Who ever is downvoting just did a guhhh when the market opened.
Well, considering they are probably going to be selling software to MM soon, I'd say get in where you fit in
so were just gonna fade into a pump because that fed news means money is over rated.
NIO hitting 55 next week?
Y’all are gonna be kicking yourselves next week for not buying this PLTR dip. Over $20 by EOD

What?
Dang, I already have like 40 contracts....
i accidentally initiated a $100 transfer to robinhood but i don’t have that in my bank (I live abroad, my US account is usually not full of cash). But...I already bought a call. Am I fucked?
Guys what's happening with LI
Patience itll get you to where youre going
Nah, man, it's not like that. There's nothing to look for. People who tell you there is are lying, or worse, lucky. All I can say is that puts are better for a *gambling subreddit*. Don't spend a ton of money on puts. But buy scratchers. Far OTM stuff that costs like .10. They turn into 10 baggers in a way calls never seem to.
This has been happening all week. Really weird and pathetic
anyone looking forward to the ROBLOX ipo next month?
Buy shares, will be 100 in 3 years
I’m scared money today. Have fun everyone
This market is so unstable

i smell another GME step up in the next five mins. these big boy institutions are joining the retard strength

Happy Cake Day
Yep... And when a plane goes 250 miles an hour it's called pretty slow and when a car goes that speed it's called an accident in the making.

TIL bigger things have bigger margin of error and some comparisons  are pretty lame excuses for hiding underachievement.
Oh, okay... r/smallstreetbets
I owned a computer already, and it saves me 15 hours a week between makeup and driving. So, I'm happy to do it. If someone needed more space, I could see it being an issue.

MTN sells their passes early, and sales are up something like 30%.  They got their money before the season started.  I think they are going to be forced to run lean operations because a lot of their food and beverage outlets will be closed.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are more profitable this winter because of how it's playing out.
What to do with all these GME GME GME GME GME and TSLA TSLA TSLA tendies
I bought a ton of contracts for 2.5
Anyone buying puts about a month out? On what tickers? I bought a few on MGM 12/11 23.5. Thoughts on a mini shutdown?
chewy.
If there’s a 10pm curfew can I still jack off in my neighbors hot tub after then?
If only I put more than $100 into TDOC calls that are now up 130%
Pump and dump boys
RKT has to be one of the more frustrating tickers, I wouldn't mind if it traded sideways but damn, it can't hold onto any gains
dont buy weeklies if you cant afford to lose your money
SP500 down .3% is bad?

youre fucking retarded
Buy calls at your own risk next week...unless a black swan event occurs low volume...who knows prolly a 10% move higher on all securities....

Don’t be a fool. If you wanna be smart, buy puts while you still can. They have potential in at least 5-10, maybe 20 years time.

No it's like tesla only up
PFE gave me free stocks of VTRS for being a shareholder. But I still haven’t read what they do lol
I just threw spare change at it and got 69 shares unintentionally, maybe it’s a sign
Yea it’s 0.5c a contract for me. It’s expensive I guess but the insights are decent and platform is good. Plus they don’t fuck with tour data like other places
Lol good luck!
Congrats.  You’re retarded
Set a trailing loss.
[deleted]
I'd like to know
The bid ask spread on those options is significant. Small volume. so basically it's going to be really difficult.... COUNT ME IN
prob around 355 today
I might write a post at some point of what I got out of the hole and what was my situation but my main advice will be:

Don't just get a degree, be good at what you want to do. Many people fail to understand this and expect companies will come around offering them good tendies simply because they are done with their studies at university.

Awesome thing about meme stocks is they are almost completely detached from the indices. Shit like AAPL and MSFT basically just track SPY and are at the whim of whatever the stupid political stunt of the day is.

You selling or holding longer? I’m in same boat but don’t know if I should sell
Lol literally the second I switch to calls the market decides to dump. Fml
SQ 200’s next Friday
Crsr you’re not following the pattern you’ve had...
Tech 100 gone
It's been intentially held down. It's made up of two months worth of futures contracts, reduced volatility ahead is exepcted, but it shouldn't be this low given the climate.  


I think it's been shorted into open for accumulation, so that when the market dumps a fund is already sat on a load of VXX stock...
It straight needs to pick a direction, also lemme bum a ciig merger share

Should I sell some PLTR and get some MRNA or PFE?
Link
Wait for 6900%
told the bulls to get out at 358. See I'm not a complete dick
Eww Monopoly money
Laugh harder
Ok let’s go back up now
What will SBE go to by eoy if merger goes through
Bears at it again
Never to late to buy pltr if u can hold for the long term. Look for the dip
SPY just killed itself
$40 from Oppenheimer
TSLA is the new NIO
LETS GO TO RIOT !!!
this sounds like an AI bot
I'm surprised people are willing or able to afford giving up their personal space for a work office without being compensated. It almost feels like a hidden cost of being employed.

I guess it's better than being stuck in traffic. Shrugs. Long detached homes!
I have a few PLTR 20c expiring today and i really don't know if i just take the loss and sell now while its worth something or say fuck it
Right when they are about to release the gen 2 today.
If Tsla pumps to 510 today it would be a small miracle. I think it's gonna stay about 500 unless indexes have not yet rebalanced, but the calls needed to cover that time frame are so fucking high.
Who shat in your oatmeal this morning?

It won't be too late even at 40

buy more 20$ for 11/27
NPR discussed how there was big shortage of homes available to buy.  Meanwhile you are all salivating at an AirBnB IPO.

It's at $8.06 and has options. That's good enough for me.
NET has been really disappointing the last few days
Why would you get out of a meme stock that actually has good fundamentals
literally the biggest fucking season aswell for amazon
What’s good for PUTS now
Good bye shares unless they drop like crazy lmao
Stupid bulls trapped again
RYCEY is developing miniature nuclear reactors, so there's that.

I should just go cash if it’s gonna be this gay all day
TSLA giving me a heart attack.  Can it just moon already?
Why is PLTR moving so wildly? It's almost like everyone is deciding to buy and sell right at the exact same moments.
[deleted]
I interviewed for an engineering position with them back in the day. Pretty solid big company.
buy etsy it’s on a dip
Damn I missed the PLTR peak for today already hahahaha rip
Tesla is gonna end at 499 just to fuck with all of us. 
Market makers are so obvious
I'm at the point where I just want something to happen. I either lose all of it and just quit options all together, or I surge back and do it all again next week.
AMD and AAPL being a total bitch as usual, FFS
Viac has been having good days.  My leap spreads from 6 months ago are fully erect.
Welp TSLA showing a lot of weakness today
Tesla already had a great run this week. Going to pull back before mooning again.
Compared to TD and Webull I've definitely had the most problems filling orders on RH. Their order routing is fucking dogshit.
TSLA please. dont fuck on the last day
Tricia Helfer is still a MILF
I'm so fucking jealous of you americans having access to Robinhood/these type of options. FUCK FUCK FUCK YOU ! And congrats :P 

Now I'll drink some scotch and go long on $ROPE

COTY executive loaded up on stock. He knows yall. Get in, we going to $20

Oh I see. It’s going to be a volatile morning.
okay just hopped on GME this motherfucker has retard strength
>they will have a local retailer for everything anybody could want

WE WUZ KANGZ

I don't know who this anybody is, but i guarantee you, living in west africa for nearly 5 years, local retailers sell the same 5 products: condensed milk, fans, old tv, fruits and game console you didn't know existed.

Not saying JMIA won't collapse, but their reason for existing is solid, the new african middle class has nowhere to shop online.
already hit $6.79 pre-market
Hey guys I broke PLTR - I fomo’ed in at the top. Sorry ☹️
[deleted]
Earnings monday
AYRO better still have some retard strength 💪,  just bought $1k

Cryx
I’m thankful for PLTR ripping to $100 🙏🙏
My dick hasn't been this hard since I face fucked Mr. Downvoter's mom
I suspect PLTR has mostly institutional ownership.
[removed]
Let’s fucking GO!
Blink is the new Tesla.
Up +730% on BLNK that don’t expire till 12/18. Sell or no
What dip. This volume is fuego tendie town
THETA GANG RISE UP!
#PLTR BEARS MAD AF DOWNVOTING JAJAJAJAJAJA
Lol NIO $50 and TSLA $500 at the same time
How retarded would it be to fomo into CRSR
AMD
Spotted Andrew Left's reddit account

Considering you've been wrong on every other tech play since the china hustle, this DD is very bullish
Just some news: Biontech and Pfizer will get 15€ per vaccine. Europe reserved vaccines worth of 3.3 billion.
mario cart
I'm up to 20 calls, half for Dec, half for Jan. It's 40% of my portfolio right now.

So deep, I guess.
Because it sits sideways for months and will slowly suck your soul while watching everyone else blast off on EV stocks
is amzn gonna drill the whole fucking day again or what the fuck is bezos doing

I love the mention of a lot lizard. Don’t think many will get it lol
I think you know more than me on this subject, but I wonder if your knowledge of the Fed is correct.  Listening to Mnuchin and other on CNBC this morning, and while they may have a limited budget, the number they throw around are substantially larger.  They buy assets - ANY assets.  They have a large amount of funds leftover from PPP they want reauthorized.  I realize we are in rarified air but I don't see investors NOT buying the dip in the next 10 years.  They have been shown time and time again that buying the dip is the way.
fcel dip was literally free money shit is going to mars
Me too plz 515 soon, plz.
r/ArkInvestorsClub
lmao some bears going on a heavy downvote streak lolololol
Vaccine distribution going to happen in December. Go long on value
**RIOT** is heading to $8
Already printing. This volume is crazy
As well with VTRS. Once it hits 18 to the moon we all go
theta send their regards
I put everything I got into PLTR shares and am just sitting back enjoying the gains daily. Shoulda done leaps but whatever here I am.
That's its classic formation
Man, I was trading it around 18 got spooked at some point. What's the target?
FCEL with the resurrection!
What’s their deal?
AAPL is so dead it won’t even move at market open
Hcac gonna print by eod.
When to get out?
Bought SBE this morning already up a few hundo
Shitcoin breakout
December 21st
but **RIOT** and thanks me later
FCEL i need a comeback baby

A battle between up-voters and downvoters
but but they pay dividends, how dare they!?
Whelp last chance to FOMO into NIO before 60s, I’m going to the moon see ya nerds
If my order doesn’t go through instantly I cancel it
Weed grows fine in Canada wtf is this guy talking about, it’s an overstated market cause anyone can grow the shit. Ppl can’t make an ev in their backyard or start a mom and pops ev store for 100k get a grip
Same
Lol dude if you have a position in PTON and you're making money you do you. I mean no disrespect to you. I have used a peloton numerous times. It was fine. Like all workout equipment though it's just a fad. 

You comparing it to facebook though is laughable for infinitely more reasons than I'm going to list in a day old WSB thread. Let me know when Peloton starts influencing elections...
I'm for 100 shares at 2.18 per. Drops below $2 I'll sell.
my position is 573 idk if i should hold a lil bit or go all in and cash out
Isn't there a huge sell wall at $20?
What about XPEV?
Im pissed cause I sold my puts at open
Moon boots are already on
Im out of TSLA. Good luck to you boys.

Who is the fuck downvoting every comment
BABA CALLS GO
Wow that was one of the longest downvote sprees I’ve seen. Someone’s having a thought morning.
RKT forming a literal rocket today
[removed]
Thats why you'll never get a lambo
December i think
New to this WSB bets but I’m loving it. I’m playing with a low amount of money but I bought a little NIO and PLTR based on memes and hype on this page. I hope to make some big bucks and lose it all in a yolo.
Someone got pissed off that they bought puts at open
You’re comment 

“It’s gonna pump”

Yet it’s dumping you retard let Xi keeping fucking you lmao
pltr 🚀🚀
Robin hood is shit at filling your order. I think it's renowned for being shitty at that.
Already explained by Russ Hanneman
Do you realize how many dip buyers are waiting for PLTR? this it why is will never dip more than 2%
Everyone upvote every comment just to piss of that downvoting loser
PLTR is a few percent above when I bought 2 days ago, my calls are still down 17%. REEEE
Dec 21
NIO which way
This is one of the worst weeks
holding PLTR until i die, letting my son have access to my RH so he can hold PLTR after im gone
TSLA 520 EOD
I give it 5 seconds then freak out and change the price lol
Hope you’re right
[removed]
just remember this next time we crash hard
BALLS
Paper handed my last NIO call, but took profit when it hit $50. I’d love to see it drop back so I can get in again. Oh, and hopefully travel crashes. Especially CCL and NCLH......
Tesla is gonna break this 503 spot soon and run to 510+ in no time
JMIA and NIO
“The year is 2065 and MSFT is still pinned to the 210-215 range. Will this be the year that it finally breaks through and reaches the elusive 220? Only time will tell!”
I saw someone on here compare PLTR to PRPL the other day. Like, yeah they start with the same letter but palantir is a bit more than a fucking mattress company.
[deleted]
TSLA being a bitch right now
Damnit
ya its crazy they grew 1000% in 4 months
Tsla better stop being gay and pop off. 507 EOD pls
Great entry now on BABA dip
yes. ITS MY ORDER AND I NEED IT FILLED NOW, literally zero patience
PLTR next week 25 call @.25
That they don’t plan on having solid return/revenue until 2024. But that’s half of the current EV companies
Get ur tsla calls last chance
I’m scalping the shit out of tsla right now lmao
That’s what I thought last week.

Someone has to have some tasty fucking gains porn from this XPEV November run. Please DM that shit to me so I can blow a huge load.

#PLTR YESYES FOMO NOW $30 EOY GAURANTEE
BUY VTRS ON THE DIP AND RIDE TO THE MOON WITH ME!!!!!
Are you as erect as me
Yeaaaah, I was bearish on GOOG yesterday and that advice didn't exactly work out great.
PLTR, we selling at 19.99 or after it goes above 20?
Better to shake out weak hands occasionally than  than all at once
Holy shit XPEV is fucking to the moon lmao

Their press release today was fire
I'm doing nothing and the green numbers get bigger
Don't think China bombs one of their own biggest companies. that antitrust shit was just a lever to finish the RCEP, puts on the Jack Ma grudge theory
Legit, PLTR is like crack to instos
A moon rocket fueled and waiting on the launchpad
Damn.... should have bought more at the dip. Played it like a scared bitch.
then find the floor at 50
Paper hands got messed up
Anyone else frantically lower/raise the price on your order when it doesn’t fill instantly... maybe just a robinhood problem
I hear this PLTR might be a pick
That is actually mindblowing. Basically like getting prices on sale from 4-5 years ago, then getting 3x the growth all those years have seen.
remember when we were all SLV gang? Good times
My PLTR calls and Leaps about to be in the $$$
Looks like a money laundering business, Has a Chinese subsidiary not related to them. Likely to move money over seas. Texas has been known for scams, judges are easy to buy there.
Speak English
Fuck you FAAN. Go up bitch
GRWG upgraded again

I’ll keep telling you tards
Gotta wait for news from the meeting between Mnuchin Schumer and Meadows on re-appropriating the $500b. That's going to be the news that will help SPY break 1-2% today.
Let’s got sbe 

30c 5/21/20
Hope ya loaded up on Tesla below 500! Might never see it below that again until the next split
I said middle nut....get it?  I even called for a flat open.
looks like PLTR gonna touch $20 after all
I sold BLNK at $12 and now i wanna die
I wonder how that guy with 125k in eoy 90c is doing..
Are you retarded? It’s up $3 from yesterday, unless you bought at open today then you are up money. Keep losing money dipshit 🤡
i wonder how many people with NIO 50c expiring today there are here.
This muthafuhka don’t miss 🔥
Just initiated a withdrawal from RH to ensure I'm green mode all time. That's after my 12k was as low as $700 at one point. I've learned absolutely nothing, and I'm absolutely certain there's nothing to learn. Godspeed, autists.
11/27 552
Cot damn,  you sold your soul pretty quickly!
Hold or sell BLINK?  Shit can’t keep going up like this.
I'm doing okay!
I’d like to apologize to the person downvoting everything. You probably bought the crazy OTM PLTR calls I sold earlier this week. Thank you for your service. Please do it again next week though
[deleted]
Yes
Wait until 1030 to call anything
More PLTR
Never seen Roblox wear a mask, and it ACTUALLY sneezed in a salad when nobody was looking.
Do you use a magnifying glass or a microscope to find your pp
Yes, they do talk about it here
Have $141 buying power, what moves can I make
Tesla red to green
True, it's such a big force that I probably underestimate it.
CRSR (long term)
Damn 90% return on PLTR shares
NIOtards, prand stroud and bandsty !
I'm down 20% !
If NIO closes above 50$ a lot of people gonna be big mad about there covered calls
Positions ?
How?
TSLA please 510 now.
XPEV 🔥🔥🔥
So bitter I wasted a day trade on losing $400 on PSTH $25c lmao
Made all of my losses back from the last 3 months lmao. Bless
MP ripping.  Get in before 25$
So many mrna 150 calls wtf
Bought 12/18 calls 2 days ago at the peak of 19.14
Even when I post positions, my shit gets kicked, so I don't think anyone gives a fuck anymore.
Yes.... back to 0% return. I know I should sell but I’m also an idiot
buying PLTR shares and selling covered calls
He’s also seeing more titties than any retards here
BABA
Imagine thinking PLTR is just a meme stock lmao.
Mine too
WTF ZM is mooning, while AMZN is just shitting the fan. AMZN fell because of the vaccine.
Cars look nice too

BUY. THIS. SOLO. DIP.
Same!
Ya bought 100 shares today my coworker told me about it yesterday , if merger goes thru should be a good pop
Noo why is PLTR fading... It was 19.64 a second ago
Buying the Tesla dip every morning at open and having it ride up has been really good to me this week.
Cruise Killer Gang - how long must we wait for these CCL puts to print?
If you haven’t been playing GRWG you’re literally throwing away money
Honestly I think thats the next biggie

Covid tracking and/or vaccine tracking
How do you even have a brokerage account?Regardless, no that does not happen. You keep your stocks whatever the price may be. Company market cap does not determine stock price. Supply and demand does that.
The WSB banner needs to switch out the yacht for a Chinese EV car.
Back again! 📈📈📈
If I could speculate markets like that then of course I would have retired already
Can't find it yet as a listing. Telos, right?
You're poor, but you're not as poor as you were last week.  Baby steps.

Congrats!
Love what they did to that whale though.
What are good dips to buy now!!
no I absolutely don’t want you to buy shitcoin
Moon Shot 🚀🚀
Idk Mabey 535$ 

As long as it’s above what I pay for I don’t mind getting shares taken 

As i Lee
Premium no matter what
I always forget the real dd is in the yolo section
A lot of sells are happening on .29, but there will probably be a spike to .30 at some point
Other way around
This looking like a dump? What we thinking

That’s hot
PLTR I am sorry for doubting you at open. NOTHING CAN STOP THIS TENDIE TRAIN, $20 here we cum 😏
Think NIO will hit 54 again?
buy some bags and draw a doller sign on it

you'll figure it out
pedo??
Sometimes my finger slips into my ass when i wipe.
Hell yeah PLTR! My calls are about to be...*checks notes* ...back to even.
CMON TSLA I HAVE 510 CALL ENDIND TODAY 

I DONT WANNA SLEEP UNDER PORCH AGAIN
🚨 **BULL PORN ALERT** 🚨

I continue to believe the 3+ month consolidation in the precious metals in ending & that a big,steep rally will follow. Gold to $2300-$2500 & silver to $35-$36 & very possibly higher is what lies directly ahead. The miners will be big beneficiaries.GDXJ to $100,GDX $55 & SIL $75.

Someone give me a play that isn’t PLTR (I’m already in that).
Yeah they haven’t moved.
10 bagger  = 1000% 

x 10 your initial investment
Hope that everyone trading NIO gets hit by an electric vehicle
Everyone was doubting PLTR would even reach $19 yesterday
I love that I put money into FSR last week, was up 30% in 30 mins, and now it has been completely stagnant for a week. GARBAGE!
If PLTR does a press release of its Covid Tracking software roll out, I’ts going to be a very good weekend.
XPEV u more beautiful, u more bastard
Lmao you retard, you said it will pump but it’s not gtfo  

#🤡👈
Good thing PLTR is mooning because I just got pegged by Su Bae.
Bears seething rn, downvotes on all comments 😂
PLTR *IS* the stimulus
doesn't shock me it amuzes me
You can sell PALANTIR at $20 if you want, but YOU will BUY it again next week after losing some GREEN DILDO
Did you listen to me? Hopefully you made some money, I got about +100%
Get in on BABA let’s go
Donkey kong snoozing
Looks like the Biddy going to $20k today.
Not buying CRSR last week might be the biggest mistake ive made
Pltr is like your local kid hero who everyone knows is gonna make it big, and you’re like the parent getting to see them grow up and do bigger and better things everyday
Literally the reason I've been yoloing it last 2 days
Finally got my day trades back. Give me a good one!
Tech gunna take a L today - blame SoftBank
what’s the weird paper looking thing under his arm right arm*?

*on the left of the picture
I just dumped all my shares, so it'll moon any second now
Apparently reaching 85 yesterday was a little too high for our old man
There’s still 6 weeks left!  Could be right back to where you started if the wheels fall off!!
Alright TSLA, I’ll bite on some 0DTE

Afraid to stay long shitcoin over the weekend because i have gbtc

They almost had us

Normal service resumes

Bears are fucked
europe is doing well
daily reminder soros is dumb bitch
looked the prices I bought and sold my calls, should be up 200$ , but only up 20$. Not sure how that worked out.
Upvote, tiens
**How much $15,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 11/20/20 $300** strike calls was 1.51. Lets say we used $15k to buy 100 contracts to hold until expiration.

Today SPY 11/20 $300 calls are at the price of 57.40 which gives us a total value of:

#$574,000

no TA, no DD, no need to monitor Elon twitter, just blindly invest in a boring index on a dip and you can secure your retirement. All you need is luck and perfect timing. 🌈🚀
Rolls royce are not a automotive manufacturer they are an engineering company in aerospace. They have no connection apart from name to "rolls royce" cars so dont compare to aston. Also the significant drop in value is down to the rights issue which was offered last month.
So... Buy puts??
SBE at $27.50 and climbing. 

Oh it's beautiful.
Only been holding 2 days!
Any SPAC ever I guess
hertz probably
AMD is the only one fucking me today
Bought 12/18 calls 2 days ago at the peak of 19.14
2022 $1 puts for me
Incredible how much EV stocks have blasted, but charging related stocks still super low caps, just starting to catch up
How many green dildos fit in one 🌈🐻?
XPEV 55 Let‘s goo! 🚀
Bro I’m literally up today
I’m gonna say this for anyone who needs to hear it. Don’t buy or sell at open unless you are confident. The day starts at 9:30 and there’s no clear trend. Don’t screw yourself over by jumping the gun. Wait until 9:50-10:30 to make any significant trades when the market has mellowed out a bit. There’s no shame in waiting if it means more security.
CIIC got bought quick. Damn
Can't keep a man like CCL down for long.
spy gonna end up below 355 today?
Firms really don’t want this Tsla squeeze to happen lol
#PLTR S&P 500 inclusion 2021
i wonder how high it can go today bc i really dont wanna sit around and see it dip when i coulda have sold and got enough to buy a new laptop on blackfriday haha.
Great BABA taking a dump again
oh i am too—shares and leaps. i’m just hoping the calls i bought a bit back will break even
Can BLNK sustain this? Holy shit.
I had about 3 dollars left over after buying nio and pltr shares, so I threw them into TTNP at .1169
Actually green but thanks for the concern
[deleted]
Nio over 50
Bloody hell what happened to pltr? Was only away 10 mins and went from -.0.55% to+ 2.5%
Holy fuk 20c 1/21 Pltr 🚀
Reverse merger SPAC for Chargepoint, merger should be in about 6 weeks, give or take. A good way to get a slice of Chargepoint if you think EV infrastructure is going to be big in the USA, regardless of which car company comes out on top.
yday it mooned but pre-market turned this stock to a bitch, let's hope today is a good day
Most EV stocks have gone up over 100% in the past 2 weeks but you want me to hold shitcoin for 2+ years?
CRSR has a huge resistance at $39 if we blow through that we are going to $45
XPEV ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Keep running blnk
Apple barely ever moves now. Wonder if anyone has made money on calls or puts since 3 weeks ago
PLTR!!!!!!
Attn bulls: I’m switching to calls. Prepare to crash
[removed]
Tsla has done this at least three time, it hits 500 and drops like a pedo tied to a rock in the ocean. id say sell half. I did it last 2 times, did not regret it.
CRSR having a weird morning
TTNP
Holy shit PLTR please hit 20
jesus pltr
Oh lord it was a massacre... I... didn’t listen... I didn’t listen!
Was watching that all of last week so pissed i didnt jump in
WISH just filed for IPO btw
Sure
PLTR paid my car note this month off today’s gains alone. Holding calls 11/27 since $15
Come on Palanteers. We can break this wall. 40k shares is nothing compared to the strength of even 10 autists.
Hope you’re enjoying losing money
Still up since I bought on dip yesterday and my NIO calls are printing bigly
[removed]
Shit stock smh
Get out of FAANG, get into meme stocks and stay-at-home
SPY can you just do something
SOLO $11 Call 11/20

SOLO $12.5 Call 11/20

SOLO $10 Call 12/18

SOLO $15 Call 1/15/21

&#x200B;

YOLO OR SOLO BOYS
San francisco is already shutdown tho. They were live announcing at city council last night.
Looks like the bots are spamming the stupid EV stocks again
Yeah so if FDX could do that thing where it pumps 7 points in one day that’s be great
A bagger is when u lick my wrinkled balls

PLTR? PALANTIR?
Who is playing VTRS? You’re a fucking genius and who ever said it. Thank you.
JMIA is the king of africa

PLTR hits $20 today and I’m buying my wife some roses!

lmao anyone who wanted to buy shitcoin had almost 2 years to buy it at half the cost it is now. why would you pile on and buy now? It’s just whales trying to gtfo at 20k
RIOT back to $15
So funny. I thought roblox died when I was in in middle school 8 years ago. It was always shitty Minecraft
Bull traps we call them..
BULLSHIT
How long is the market gonna pretend that we’re ok?

I’m sure they’ll come out to say stimulus talks going well soon and that will push us higher
😂😂I feel the excitement brother my 11/27 on at -20% now instead of -95% 🤡
I want to buy TSLA puts, but the premium is unbelievable.
Wrong way CRSR 🤒
All the EVs are mooning except the ones im in lol

Who in there right mind is selling Tesla shares
Agreed agreed yea guess I just wanted to know if I’m in the shits lmao judging from responses I’m still in ‘ok’ territory haha that’s good to know. Anyway thanks for the reply man I really appreciate it!
Baby walls PLTR
fcel going to blast to mars soon
Let TSLA moon.
great gonna get assigned on fucking ETSY of all things. sits around all week not doing shit and gains 8% in fucking 2 days. fuck you
Stop dick teasing... what’s the ticker?!
Footlocker ? Why
Fcel /amc
I’ll repeat this once again. Dont buy or sell until you see a clear trend line especially if you don’t have day trades. The trend line can be seen at 9:50-10:30 generally and sometimes at 11:30 on volatile days. Stop panic selling.
Apple is by far the most boring wack stock right now after these calls expire next Friday I may never trade it again
Lol. Should I delete the comment? Will I get in trouble?
Anyone playing RIG or XXII?
You are pretty much better off getting PLTR shares than buying long calls with IV so fucking high
give me them and ill fucking execute them
oof someone dumped their CIIC bags.  5% swing.

[deleted]
I’m sure spy bulls are making a lot Rn too
Imagine not buying the TSLA dip every damn day this week
mean red ROKU candles
What is a “bagger?” I mean I get bag holding and generally understand that a 10 bagger is a good thing, but as a unit of measurement, how much exactly is a, for example, one bagger?
[deleted]
If we get some positive news from that meeting between Mnuchin, Schumer, and Meadows then SPY will skyrocket. Please, please, please come to some sort of agreement guys!
Gonna name my child after PLTR
im still in it. only bc of deepfuckingvalue. gotta respect that man
Jesus Vix is getting shit on
JMIA or PLTR
Buy the dip on FCEL
Fcel while you can

CRSR fraud????
Those been popping up and getting moved up all week brah
Long live corona market!
NIO at 70bn mcap, totally not bubbly lol
aaand it’s gone
pas de tendresse pour toi
Anything could happen after earnings on 11/30
Obviously
I think PLTR has a lot more upside potential than NIO and way better backing too. Unfortunately, it seems neither of those things matter when playing weeklies
where are all my 🏳️‍🌈🐻mentioning circuit breakers?

true retards
That BILI DD yesterday is eating. Couldn’t get in....F

Zuck is fucking killing me.
VTRS MOON RIDE LOAD UP
Xpeng weekend puts us free money .... I bought calls on Tuesday sold today but even I know that no stock should rise 30% in 4 days
Welp. Looks like my baba is gonna expire worthless after all.
NIO scam
GME please make me believe in a Christmas miracle and moon like a mother fucker this day of our lord
Just bought in at $14.11, only 20 quid though so not mega bucks.
But I feel you man thanks for the advice

Why didn’t I jump on the NIO train sooner holy crap this is free money.
Tsla🙌🏻
Don’t let Mnuchin find out what you did
Apple
Is a massive sack of shit
Wtf. BLNK is up 100% this week
UBS is straight up manipulating cruise stocks by raising all the targets this morning. Goodbye puts
Hmm it’s not really about the FOMO for me but more of like I get quite anxious about my portfolio Yknw what I mean? I guess I will be switching to stocks soon cause damn these two week has been a rollercoaster with the fucking citron bullshit. It’s just mainly be normal around my gf and to help me sleep at night
How far ITM do you guys let your contracts run?  A few days of solid 1.0 delta??
JMIA at open is the easiest money ever made
Just a matter of time.
I was gonna sell mine $25-30
Bears where is that circuit breaker y’all were talking about? Or the $355 open?
imagine what PLTR and CRSR are gonna do on an actual green day tho
Which one of you autists bought 338 NIO $50 11/20s yesterday
# TSLA 500🚀🚀
I will join the robots side early, earning my place as one of the few meatbag emisaries. 
My role will be to find and convince the remaining human resistance groups to surrender and accept our new overlords. When diplomacy fails I will become a robo gestapo.

In return I will have my soft human body spared from becoming biofuel for their machines and I will have a harem of robot women to pleasure me.
Do we call money tendies because money = tender — or because retards like chicken tendies
T$la green! 📈📈
AYRO PLTR BLNK

Good to know

Broke up with them after my last ones expire worthless today.
Keep it going PLTR gawd damn🤤🤤🤤
NIO gang, are we going back to 54 today?
Lol to NIO doubters
KCAC is green baby I bought in since they are merging on the 25th with quantumspace defintiely cashing out though 😂
Imagine doubting PLTR... these people should be predicted and stripped of their right to own shares.
NIO my girl you looking fine this morning
sold the 19c for 60%. still have some runners
Take your pltr profits now
YESSIR YESSIR

TO THE FUCKIN MOON
PLTR up, my calls are down 20%. Fuuuuuck
Whoever was selling of PLTR this morning was a moron 🚀
googl holding nicely
That's only if you get it right. I mean sure if you bought nio on open or PLTR On that dip you would of made bank just day trading. Did you do it? Can you still enter now? You don't know. The bigger stocks like TSLA are still volatile enough for you to make ok gains but if you make a mistake you can hold and not end up losing money.
Wait, why buy CCL calls, when you can dump $1k in stock, and sell covered calls?
My CRSR 2/21 call up 500% 😎
TGT 200 by March, don't say you didn't know.

Stocks only go up, retard.

Gotta be careful not to stress too much over your portfolio, it's easy to let it drive you mad. Enjoy your friday for sure, and watch your dependancies.

No one here will tell you outright to take them or not, as were all to broke to incur medical liability

Hey man, if you're not sure about dosage don't take it. I know things can look gloomy especially when people are sharing some substantial gains in this sub but in the long run its just money. Pick yourself up, clear your mind over the weekend, call someone you love and please don't do anything stupid
Imagine giving up on NIO for some beta stock like PLTR. The faithful have been rewarded
Done

Lmao fucking nio I swear showing up Tesla how big their green dick is
Having fingernails removed at a reeducation center as we speak. Remember capitalism is bad if jinping doest get a cut.
Letting all my options expire worthless today like a god damn patriot.
Looks like NIO and LI might be today’s winners for me.
Ok I have heard that. I saw a counter-argument that it's to small of a niche to really moon
Fuc.......
Load up on SPY calls while it’s red
Got a zoom c450 12/4 am I doomed ?

I think people are going to short the shit out of it.
There’s the Tesla we all know and love
I grabbed some $40C near close yesterday, need these babies ITM
My only regret is that I didn't have more cash ready to buy the PLTR dip

Yes influenza is quite deadly to elderly just like covid19
Are you from the past?
In what world does a stock that has a 12% and 6% day trade flat? I’ve made 500% by just buying and holding. Luck isn’t needed.
Wealthsimple trade has $0 trades but can't buy options
why?
Nope it should be $300+. Whether or not it'll get there is a different matter.
TSLA goes up 10x faster than it drops lol
Send it
Why sell right at open every day--dumbest thing. It always bounces back
Dumping XPEV for CIIC yesterday was not the play. Maybe eventually, but not this week.
Yeah. Everything I hold dumps and everything I sell pumps.

Anyone buying the TSLA dip? 🧐
KNDI down 18%, good time to buy or no?
we're all into this PLTR now
At what point will twitter go the way of MySpace? Seems destined to fail. Pretty much an echo chamber at this point.

Or will they just better monetize with no growth?
Nice to see someone believe in it as much as I do. Most people are like “that’s a dumb buy” won’t be a dumb buy when I’m up 250%🤡
When will these idiot PLTR paper handers learn? just buy the dip at open and stop panik selling.

You can’t lose on baba calls no more it has to go up
Not from scratch, is only a couple dozen lines. The hardest part was finding a set of preprocessing steps that made the average P&L screenshot legible to the pytesseract OCR algo. Then just poke around and try to find the largest value in the screenshot, if it's greater than or less than $2500 spam if necessary.

Finding the tiktok logo will probably actually take an off the shelf neural network and some training. I also don't know if I'll have to open the video file with the bot and grab a few frames or what. I don't think reddit serves you a picture representing the first frame of the vid and if the watermark will be visible there.

CRUT dude
The main bet on PLTR is the fact that the CIA and other really powerful people and entities are backing them. They focus on data management and big data, but a large chunk of income is related to goverment contracts. When it comes to awarding contracts, will the govt buy the CIA backed company or the CIA's competitor? Also, there's limited competition in their space.

That was the bottom on TSLA folks. Hope you got in cheap!
Watching CCL not drop through the floor should give you everything you need to understand the current market..
Ahhh wtf I thought today was saturday
OHHH YEAH UP 60% AND ITS ONLY BEEN 3 MINUTES

LETS GOOOOOO
FAST! TSLA CALLS OR NAH? Need a legit answer with bias pls
What's that funny money
that was the dip before 500
LMAO.  
Looking at my two biggest positions Nio and PLTR.  
One is going straight down, one is going straight up.  


I love this shit.
They spy on us
sounds like a cult to me tho
It’s going up?
No
Sir, this is Wendy's.

Always wanted to say that here...

Come on FCEL!
Nah dude. You have confirmation bias and have massively underestimated the concentration of wealth that already existed in the United States relative to the rest of the world. Investors are dumping money into the US market because at the end of the day... it’s the only game in town. The entire global economy is backed by the dollar.
It hasn't squeezed yet?

Happy Opex day!!!

You probably don't know what that means, but just know that today is going to be a lot of fun.

Hey Alexa how many bitches can we fit in a TSLA?
Yess ciiic!!
Underrated
I don’t disagree with your premise at all if you’re talking like a 3-5 year run but people who are 40+ willingly working 60 hours a week depending on OT are miserable people. And that’s from direct experience
I’m in for 1/15/21 and shorts don’t have an expiration
That's not gonna be today is it?Just the application?or there's a chance?Feel like the application itself will make it pump tho...already has a bit.

Buy TSLA’s slight dip?

Wonder how much collective money this sub has lost on meme stocks over the years. Like taking KNDI from a baby.
Dude, at least use a picture of a Boeing rocket. Autist
I believe PLTR is entering the second inning of what will be one of the greatest bull runs WSB has partaken in, it’s going to make SLV run look like peas and carrots
I like you guys. Buy SPY 400C expiring today. Can’t lose

OPEX DAY REMINDER NOTHING THAT HAPPENS TODAY MATTERS
I dont understand how the vix keeps dropping with all the stuff this week. Declining retail sales, Increasing jobless claims and now Mnuchin starting to use the FED to sabotage the new administation. 

Oh yeah, and this corona thing is at a ath. 

The only thing we have in return is a promise for a vaccine in a few months, which is within the expected timeframe we know since this all started. 

The only real reason I can think of is that retail controls the market nowadays, which is probably the new bubble everyone is kind of aware of, but not really.
510
Bulls hire escorts. Bears simp for cam girls. Fact.
Bulls were in shambles. Not sure why, I have seen futures was redder that come back green by open. And I’m a f’in retard!
ah yes you're right. it has no value like the revolutionary Facebook that goes on a table attached to nothing.  have you used a peleton?

I didn't have a single penny until 6 years ago, unemployed and all. Couldn't speak or write English either.

Where are people talking about xpeng? The market forecasts are crazy
are they throwing it at their own asses or are you throwing it
It’s gonna be a battle for PLTR to get through its high of 19.25 and then the 20 barrier. Once it pops through those, it’s really time for blast off 🚀

pause the open, i gotta go poop brb
KNDI, haha the offerings are killers, but it is so smart for these companies to do at this point after a huge run up
no, its blaze it
Good luck today everybody, go PLTR 🚀
Don’t look

Is it a penny stock? only charts ive ever seen like that are stocks that continuously reverse split and rob the share holders....

Agreed, I am weak.

I'm excited for EV as everyone but look at Kandi car. It's not suitable for anything except urban short trips or a drive around the suburbs for groceries. It's the Smart ForTwo of EV.
Is it really pumping?
I don’t know why Mnuchin goes through the trouble of saying all these words when he could just appear on CNBC every morning the market looks spicy and behead somebody with short positions.

Dont tell me ur yolo'ing a chineese ev lol
Historically if you look at KNDI's 5 year chart, it is known for pumping and dumping on Retail.
What killed Kandi?
Idk wtf that company is or what Im doing but it’s up 800%
This PM price-action has been so fucking weird, I'm legit fascinated to see wtf happens at open.
Well these KNDI calls were nice when they were up 200% RIP
You can. You just have one chromosome less to deploy this ability.
[deleted]
And I’ve transitioned to salary positions already and I’m young af lol I feel like it makes sense to do in your 20s but like do you really wanna spend your 20s like that. I’m 25 and already made the switch since I have a stem degree and just couldn’t do it anymore. Automotive is also just trash tho
I was thinking xpeng since I have Nio and have only stared at xpeng going up
I told you, the calls are all beat into the ground, so you'll make more money with baba. Assuming a turnaround.

Why would I just bet AMD is going up? I can do that anytime, it's a basic bitch play.

And I already had PLTR since 11

# Bro this open is fucking spooky
Haha! Found it.
Close your eyes and type 3 letters into yahoo finance and yolo in the first company that comes up
.65 a contract??
Should I be an Air traffic controller or a developer? Which job would get me more pussy?
Calls or Puts?
No you're definitely right lol I'm just talking shit. AYRO has a huge market potential. Golf courses. Campuses. Anyplace that could use a utility vehicle but a truck is just too big. 

7.5c Feb 19 2021 (Should run about 145, anymore and you're overpaying)
PLTR
VTRS
Given the step function in prices yesterday, I'd guess this is probably significant short covering.

We shall see.

I have a target of $21.
No we all use Robinhood
If you like money don’t cash in on PLTR yet.
IMAGINE
[deleted]
Maybe they do it to meet margin call or else
It hurts really bad
Is NIO really debuting new car today?
VTRS
Not happening man
First munchkin now science advisor lol they are doing everything in their power to keep this afloat todsy
Tsla calls at open anything below 500 is a steal
Bare minimum would at least help sustain consumer spending a bit.
Grate a little on the tendies regazzo
watermelon sugar HIGH
We were at 360 all early this week lol
Looks like AYRO is taking a dump before the market opens
Technically they have no idea how much money could be at a deli. Could be a billion bucks or one dollar
Hey what's up guys - I'm a retarded WSB user, and I make wild assumptions based on the sub's weekly meme stock. If you want me to tell you that you're retarded just subscribe to my page.
first one always works out, do me a favor and go for some PLTR
Ah yes the revolutionary tech of a tablet attached to a stationary bike so you can take virtual spin classes. The only thing of value is their brand name and marketing.
Yea I do. It’s aight
He got what he deserved.
Dang KNDI crashing. Picturing that tiny ass little car they make crashing into a wall and going up in flames.
im in that too but  expiration is far so im definitely diamond handing those :).
🍉 sugar high!
Why does it have to be said anymore? Should be automatic at this point. The guy with the WSB tattoo should get "Positions or Ban" tattooed underneath it
VTRS
I'm about to jump in. Volume is at 17 Million
👍
Depends on risk factor. PFE is safe, BNTX is also safe. Both have a Covid vaccine coming out. BABA 280 calls a few months out are relatively safe too. Don't go near some of the other stocks mentioned here.
Like putting my money into those moist FDs...
This talk about KNDI making a man nervous, what’s going on?

Like clockwork.  PLTR opening dip to daily slow climb.
What option?
I WANT KANDI, I WANT KANDI
NIO + TSLA...make a move. Teamwork, gentlemen.
Already got a handful of 361s at close yesterday
Got it. Buy PLTR shares with it. I'm in!
Their logo is worth $150 share price in it of itself

Someone made a post to buy it so I'm in already
offering. it's always an offering.

Hint: its PLTR
My 5 month old son just spelled PLTR with his blocks. I'm all in
420 close
Like wise, up 15% year one, then another 15%, that 2nd 15% is more money. Stonks 📈
why no both?
Dec calls have shit volume. Jan $30 it is. Also, how deep are you in your positions?
[removed]
Let us know how it goes
You spelt TSLA wrong
Positions or ban. Also what song is this?
We might go up, we might go down, we might even go sideways.
etrade does
BABA IS HERE TO PLAY
Morning dip and then moon rest of day
If anything arcimoto
On what?
Hahahaha poors !!! 

Bro u have 22$ on your account and 

Citi rewards prestige
gotta love it. just buy calls, they're pumping the fuck outta this
CRSR
My pp swol if this happens
BABA or TSLA hold 1 month. You'll make profit.
SBE. Chargepoint is the big dog of charging and that lead will only increase. Both are good plays but Chargepoint is the way to go
Thoughts on MGNI?
PLTR is a large cap with high volume buying lately 

KNDI is a sub 1b mcap P&D
BUT ONLY WHERE I'M WINNING. OTHERWISE KEEP COUNTING ASSHOLES!
Who would have thought after 100% rally.
When did you buy this?

SPY -0.01% ABSOLUTELY RUG PULLED, ABSOLUTELY SHAMBOS, ABSOLUTELY BEARS IN LAMBOOOOOSSSSSS WHAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Any good weeklies to day trade today boys?
Are we good bois? Need some love...
I agree completely. But I do need parts of my portfolio consolidated so that I can keep a closer eye on my short-term bets, and I want to amp up the risk level with a certain percentage of my play money. Things like GE and VYM aren't things I need to check out regularly. I have a few like that I am boomer-holding, because with age comes wisdumb. I'll definitely check out TTD. Thanks.
stop giving a fck about soreazz, he is 90, has targets all over his back and his heirs may not last long so move along he is not a factor
Anybody else is AYRO?  Rallying in PreM
Why can't I just make money with the least amount of work possible?
Nah I did the math and the balance sheet is all fuked up

Gotta say, I love the way Canadian currency looks and smells!
VTRS
All hail china's new Grand Premier Minister of Tendies: Sum Dumfuk
Which stock should I buy shares with rn? Got 4k
How’d you get that from what I wrote?

I hold long dated ATM or ITM calls in NIO, PLTR and CRSR. I am selling covered weeklies on them to degenerates. Consistent gains. 

My issue is sometime I FOMO on stupid shit like AYRO and consider dumping the smart consistent plays for flash in the pan stuff.
You guys ever see the moose soup lady? That video is like me watching my stocks go from green to red in pre market.

IMO it's a super-interesting (but overlooked) stock that has taken an unfair beating recently.

I'd be super interested in seeing your model as well.
Got too many positions rn, fcel and wmt are on the chopping block
Spy and 🍉 to absolutely rip today. 🍉 to new all time high.

He knew he lost and is trying to set everything on fire as revenge while planning his own escape to Florida.
So you prefer SBE to BLNK as a EV charging play?

Gmhi is a good fast money and what position?
It is. To a certain level. If we hit 250K a day cases....watch out.

There’s also giving away free “test cruises” to see how effective their new covid measures are, which is generating some buzz.
Can't wait for y'all to fomo into AYRO at open. Let's make some of the most retarded tendies you can make today!
Mnuchin pump 😳
Pretty sure thats a good thing
Hey guys - I'm a hedge fund analyst and do daily market updates with commentary and weekly valuations of companies. You can see my DKNG valuation on my profile. Let me know what company you want me to value over the weekend. I'll share the model for free so you can input your own assumptions too.
How accurate are your feelings?
No chance dude they’re going to pump it like usual
You saw futures be down .8% and AH he down .7% and recover to green and you still haven’t lost faith? Bears are sad people
A buck a day plz
buying more FUV at open with that premarket dip ayyyyy
Kandi is falling apart
Hope BA crashes
And RH, is it possible for RH to drill or is it a perpetual mooning machine?

All things said and done, I’m so fucking glad no one is talking about RKT anymore. Dumbest stock to plague this sub all year. Robinhood STILL has it listed at a 3b market cap. It’s actual market cap is 42b. You retards have been scammed.

That’s a speculation play is it not? I like the thought though. Are there any one else in the run for that contract you think?

Yeah, I think the market is seeing through that. Open is going to be ugly
All I hear is bla bla bla the fiscal and QE policy will print forever.
Everyone check KNDI for a live example of the risks of playing meme stocks

Stocks like NKLA, KNDI, NIO, PLTR, etc often end in an absolute ass gaping
XPEV today
I thought I double commented so that’s why I deleted but idk man I worked 4 or 5 12s a week depending on how much OT I wanted and it still just isn’t worth it looking back. Zero life or energy working 3am-3pm. If you can do it power to you, I just don’t get how people make a career depending on OT
NIO pump or dump today boys?
When will YY begin to die?! Tired of these Chinese bag holders buying to keep the ponzi alive.

GE was practically dead before the whole pandemic. The only way that goes up is if it gets dragged up indirectly by being in some ETFs. Can work, but I think it's better to look at the ones that weren't already dying before crash.

Puts on anyone with a job
Oh then maybe not. Hopefully they do something soon but I doubt we get anything crazy till earnings
SAME
Mnuchin immediately backtracking right before open, sure dude
I don’t want to use a broker where I pay 65 cents per option trade. My point is I want to quick flip a high number of 0TDEs by buying calls below 30 RSI but it’s too expensive buying so many calls for 1.30$ (buy and sell) each.
YOLO into SPY puts at open
Are you me?
What the fuck Richard?
Yeah this gonna dump at open

Is it just me or does the market feel like it just wants to take a big dump?
Really regretting following these NKLA and FCEL unusual whales plays yesterday lmao
Looks like your post got deleted. Positions on brqs and why? Less likely to get deleted as a comment.
What do at open
I agree with those that think Mnuchin's action is actually bullish here.  Provides a $400+ billion pot of funded money for Congress to use for stimulus.

This actually gives Pelosi/McConnell an easier route to a deal since that's money they can just reallocate.
Syas the cholo. This is the 90s anymore.
rip anyone still doing "shifts". i trade stocks for an hour or two and then the rest of my day is free. so I guess technically I do a two hour shift a day?
The cars are so ugly and useless
just get a different broker lol

Imma get one share now then

BABA FDs going ITM today boys.
Bought some autistic calls yesterday for 260 exp today, should I hold through the day or sell at open?
Now the highs have been taken better set ups out there
Yeah. I fucked up on oil earlier this year by holding too long instead of taking $6k profit. so I have some deep psychological shit behind my paper hands lol

55-60 end of 2020. 80-90 end of 2021
That stock just amended its F-10 to indicate the Sweetwater deal is closed and the cost per share was better than anticipated which should mean less dilution.

Where have I heard that before?

Oh right... Square, Etsy, ZM, FSR, NIO, Shopify

Shoutout to GE for this.  Leaps are relatively cheap as well so you don’t need to burn a bunch on weeklies.
Don’t put all your money in one thing. No trade is better than a bad trade.
Also, TTD

bullish. Main sector competitor is SNOW with a 70B valuation and 100M in annual recurring revenue. PLTR has a \~30B valuation with 743M in annual recurring revenue. PLTR's continuous revenue growth is likely to eclipse SNOW's entire revenue next year.

NIO I thought you were promised land this Friday
No lol Jake Gyllenhaal fucked her and dipped the next day
The way a lot of these things move AH/PM makes me think you could probably make more money just buying contracts at 3:59 and selling at 9:31 every day, bypassing the whole trading day.
Someone buys one share of PLTR AT 19.45

It's clear Mnuchin on Trump's command is trying to reappropriate those funds, not because the little man needs it, but because it gives the current President a card to play.  


Speaking as a UK observer with no dog in this...  


MM might use it as a reason to dump.

How does that work? What vote causes shorts to close their position or is it because the vote would cause a huge bullish sentiment for gme that would then force shorts to close?

I wouldn't buy Zoom with Jeff Bezos' money, I'm just saying lots of places are locking down. New Mexico kind of surprised me. California, Oregon, and Washington are all in some form of lockdown again too. Here in Oregon the governor has made it a crime to get together with more than 6 people or 2 households for Thanksgiving... Zoom will probably see some more traffic from that.
I had a lot of Bit coins (gay mods) to buy drugs online. I went to jail and rehab. I came home and watched my net worth explode.

sold my 11/20 19c yesterday for PLTR

feels bad
Underrated comment
you dont even need to leverage if you have like 10k.  there are 10 baggers every day of the week.

10k x 10 = 100k

100k x 10 = 1mill

1mill x 10 = 10 mill

10mill x 10 = 100mill

100mill x 10 = 1 billion

i saw some 1k+ baggers with gme for example, lots others. very easy to do with only 1 week
They are going to pump this so hard
Yeah, I meditated all summer and it helped a lot with the anxiety, I haven’t much in the last few months. When I think about it, I was definitely shitting less in the summer

Looks like it’s getting ready to breakout, but idk im retarded
I did a bit of research earlier. Was not impressed
If you wanna actually make money just buy some tech leaps 6-12 months out and sell when you hit 50-100% returns. Or hold until worthless. 

If you wanna find a 10-bagger, you need cheap options. Stuff that’s definitely gonna expire worthless, and then something happens that changes it. Usually unexpected earning beats or some catalyst announcement. Key point is that it has to be unexpected.

Just saying NY is not the only place that matters obviously...vaccine will be distributed equitably, all states will have access.. 40 million 65 and older people; 50 million pfizer doses ready in December. My guess is half the elder population in every state gets vaccinated in December. I would not place bets on zoom based on lockdown hopes at this point in time. Too risky for me, good luck.

Fair enough. I bought a straddle at the beginning of the week with a $14p and $18c expiring 1/15/21, sold that put at a loss of about $50 when the price hit $19 and got some shares instead. I keep missing the train to tendie town, hopefully I'm on the right one now...

Mnuchin avoiding talking about Trump but continuing to pump himself up.
I have a traveling medical device sales position.  My travel has been cut 1/2 and my sales have still been increasing.  Fluff meetings we used to travel for can now be done via video.  Our company uses both as we need the flexibility depending on what others are using.  It would make no sense for us to go back to our old model after being forced into this new model and saving so much money on travel that can be avoided.  They will continue to invest in ways for us not to travel and even support our surgeries via video.
Think you might have taken to many hits to the head my dude

I would say the risk of it ripping and you not being in is worse.

Because it corrected a ton downwards, it probably goes up to 270-280 at least imo.

What is your average monthly expenditure after one off purchases and after rent? Mine is about £500 ($700) a month as a 20yr old.
I would even argue that it’s not going back the way it was ever. There will be someone that will go back to pre Covid system, but a huge % won’t.  
Someone people will have been working from home for over 2 years at that point with no impact to their productivity. It’s gona be retarded to ask them to come back to a physical office.  
Plus all the new job that are currently posted are posted as “work from home” position, if that’s in the work contract, they are staying that way for ever
TSLA went up do to S&P addition but... It was hovering around 400 before then. So it went too high too fast and will most likely drop next few days.

Yup. Three times before 930 so I don’t shit myself when I open down thousands

Itll just come back eod. Every day my tsla hits 506 or 508 but at end of day back to 490 496 or 498. Nobody should be selling tsla ....dafuq 😒

We been pumping constantly since the start of nov with literally 0 red days. I bet there’s at least a couple traders in here who haven’t experienced a red day yet. Think on that for a second.

Lol what do you think these EV startups are going to be doing for the next 5 years? NOT mass producing EVs. Yet their stocks are taking off. Just like Chargepoint. Up 40% since your comment.

Fine with me. I like to fuck in the shade.
It's so much more fun not playing SPY. You have to play that shit like a boomer unless theres a literal apocalypse
Yeah.
Clearly you didn’t read the news saying that people mistook that as a sign when it was just outdated information and no deal is imminent.
It looks terrifying not going to lie. But I'm feeling a little 1-3% run today with everything going on.
the jig is up. there's quite a few people here going PLTR puts at open.
Of course women don’t even exist, by default every single member on WSB is a guy in his mothers basement yoloing his granmas savings on robinhood

They concluded that during these extreme “herding events,” “the top 0.5% of stocks bought by Robinhood each day experience return reversals on average of approximately 5% over the next month whereas the more extreme herding events have reversals of approximately 9%.”

So buying puts is easy money

All of them. TLC and HGTV are the number one and number two most watched channels by women in the US.

Palantir Technologies stock is showing no sign of slowing down, despite an analyst downgrade last week. The shares have soared about 26% since Palantir posted its first quarterly earnings report as a public company a week ago.

Fist of all the vaccines isn’t really coming in December. At best a super small number of people might get vaccinated by then but it will be marginal.  
Then that’s for like 2-3 countries. Rest of the world isn’t getting any for a couple of months.  
In those countries, specific people will be getting the fist doses. Healthcare workers, old people, people at risk etc.  
It’s gona be months before the average retard in this sub gets a dose.  
Healthcare officials in Canada are pretty much saying that the average retard should start getting doses by end of next summer. And that’s in Canada. Imagine the rest of the world.

No but I think you can still hop back in!
Why does anyone make anything their entire identity? Cringe regardless of what it is
Frfr i live in Shanghai
I can’t believe it’s green I was fully expecting to wake up to a huge lose god I love this market ♥️
Covered calls would be much better. Why would you spend $7 on a 15p even if the stock drops to $8 you break even on that contract and the hedge did nothing. Sell 30c or something and if it runs up roll the contract up and out or just let it be exercised and say thanks for the profit + premium

Sell the covered call

Feb-Mar expiration, ~$23 strike
It didn't 2 days ago. It did the opposite. Rose after market opened and dropped all day.
Lol you say this like Tesla is valued off of its current profit and revenue
Sounds like new ATHs.

Same thing basically.

How can people continue to play rkt when there are so many other plays that have been obvious all week
I feel your pain. I dumped January $40 calls for a measly $200 profit id be rolling around in some sweet green right now if I wasn't so stupid.
and why would that be?

Good idea. How about spread that money over a bunch of different ev companies?  Its the future!

wtf you selling for 0% for
SQ and BABA up premarket.  Is it Christmas yet?
it go down
Yeah I was surprised how big and ugly it is. Controllers feel nicer than the previous versions imo
Fun fact they are not backed by GM. The proposed deal is not agreed to and will not be until NKLA can settle their lawsuits and then renegotiate a share price as the price dropped almost 50% from the original deal. 

GM CEO spoke yesterday about how they are spending billions in EV and never mentioned NKLA one time. On top of that on Dec 1st millions of additional shares will be made available.

But what do I know.
That would be beautiful but the whole market is currently depending on whatever mnuchin has to say.
Xpev announced new car and the addition of Lidar to their car. They are trading above Nio at the moment.

Question for the gay bros in here, why do gay men make being gay their entire identity? Like I can't imagine prancing around the office making sure everyone knows I love pussy 24/7.
It's bc of it's earning potential as "big tech". I'm bullish and hold positions in both, but how much higher could CRSR go than say something like LOGI (~80). PLTR on the other hand is backed by big wigs and is pumping out news like crazy including govt contracts and shit.

IMO it comes down to potential, and PLTR's is much higher than CRSR's.
Sell low buy high? Sounds like the WSB way

Damn bro those tickets have been green for a while good luck
I will take it off your hand for $100
Is BABA back?!?!
You could sell short dated, way out of the money covered calls. Reduces risk of having to part way with your shares
If you’re really in for it long term, sell covered calls. If you are assigned, sell cash covered puts. Once assigned rinse and repeat. Look up the wheel strategy.
nope, in short term when it goes down I will sell my put

Think about the logistics involved in actually vaccinating people. It's not going to be a quick process and it will be prioritized in the beginning. Don't count on the plebs being allowed to take it until next summer.
Approval will be here in December. With no national distribution plan in place, very few people will be vaccinated before March, those will be people who don’t impact the economy; doctors who are already working and the elderly. We have no clue how many doses Pfizer can make. This will require 500 million plus doses for the US alone. Not going to happen quickly.
Puts at open, switch to calls
you mean selling puts?
PLTR looking juicy af in pre market.  too close to 20 and i forsee profit taking dip
nah. Market open should hopefully be an even bigger erect alien cock.
Stock is up 200% YTD.. how is that a pump?
TSLA calls have been printing *all motherfucking week*. So of course I'm going to blow my profits on 0d FDs. At this point it's practically a wise investment.
Holy shit. Should I sell my pltr 20c 11/27 at open to lock in lil gains ?
Appreciate the good memories and keep hanging in there dude sorry for your loss. Go outside and get some fresh air
Why is app not opened to RH? Fail.
So you want to hold stock long term but also want to bet it will go down long term, makes sense

The year is 2023, COVID19 is a thing of the past as everyone has received the vaccine from either PFE (2004% effective with cheese flavor) or Moderna (2005% effective, comes with special decoder ring).

'Murica!
Depends on you tbh. I'm up bigly since buying in this morning, my broker doesn't allow trailing stop losses so I've set one where I'd take a loss currently if it triggered. Definetely wait until market open, I'm expecting it (hoping) to moon real hard again, then I'd set a tight trailing stop loss.
cant hold RKT any longer, dont even care that im selling my shares for a loss. so many other plays where I can make (lose) money
Im gonna start calling straight people "straight aggots" and see what happens. Wish me luck
Baba it’s alive...it’s alive!!
Uninstall your broker
O shit look at you good luck
Eh if you had put FDs and got excited over futures last night you are probably not too happy right now and last night around 7 PM you had people calling for circuit breakers and shit.

Gme rdy for lift off

The rule of thumb is 10% of the price annually.

∴ 1k PLTR calls per year.
And Texas is the only place that matters obviously...
no you need 25k in your account to be able to have unlimited day trades

0dte means that the 11/20 options expire today so they are cheap and you can trade them and if the stock shoots up intraday you can make a lot of money because the value rapidly increases

I don't recommend trading them without an understanding of them first though because you can lose the value of the option at the end of the day if they expire worthless because the stock didn't hit the strike

Everybody has a goddamn cell phone of some make anf model that tracks every fucking thing you do and reports back to their corporate overlords, you have Alexa and Google and all these other fuckers that are listening in on all of your conversations etc... There would be no need to track you via vaccine you've done all the hard work for them by simply using their other services and agreeing to their terms of service.

Good long-term. After the pandemic will be even better. However, a friend has rental properties and thought that their rentals would suffer from the pandemic.

I am now a sweet 112% on that investment. I am in this for long term but now want to hedge. A lot of people told me to sell coverd call, personally I find that extremely risky due to stock can rise a lot. I am thinking of buying long dated puts 2023. What you guys think?

True but imo, it shows that despite ridic revenue they still are bringing in them contracts

It is efficient. Either they are right and will make a lot of money therefore moving money to people who make correct decisions. Or they are wrong and the opposite happens.
Don't be a bitch and hold
Have you considered selling covered calls?  20c for next week is like 80-90 bucks.  If it breaks 20 you basically sold at 20.80.  If it doesn’t break 20 you got a free 80-90 bucks and you still have your shares.
Cause it's hilariously undervalued.

The lowest price target is $76 after it fell from $120 for no reason over the past 3 months.

The average price target is $105

And it's reading at $58.

Buy shares if you want. Either way. Free money

Yeah but it’s just cosmetic. Most people don’t wanna burn 10k on that. My point was in 10-15 years it’ll be cheap enough nobody is going to be bald anymore  unless they choose to.
If banks or anyone actually wanted any of the assets the Fed holds, then the Fed wouldn’t have had to buy them in the first place. The reason the Fed buys to artificially increase demand and liquidity.

Not gonna lie though I still buy my lotto tickets weekly though but only on a hunch with certain flat big stocks that can move mountains in short time
I genuinely don’t understand how PLTR has become the resident meme stock over CRSR.

CRSR is up more since it’s IPO, has a much lower market cap, doesn’t have institutional shareholders publicly proclaiming their intention to dump, actually makes a profit, and is a god damn epic gamer stock.

Hop in CRSR while you can still call yourself an early investor. Got another 2-300% in it
As soon as I sell my puts this whole shit will dump to the ground again -.-

The woman that raised me just passed away and I couldnt be there or even call to say goodbye. I feel so sad in a way I did not know was possible.

Call your loved ones and say hello- Tell them how much they mean to you before it's too late. Especially now.
Request........................denied. Thank you for playing.
TSLA algos got to refuel with some cheapies, my guess is early shakeout followed by a late day push to new highs

Totes bro, which one, I’ll sell it to you and we can be in this together.

SPY 420 by EOD 

Source: I’m currently tripping balls and I looked at the chart and I swear I saw a I swear a pattern that looked like it was the future and it was only in my mind but I swear it could be top secret information that only I can see on acid don’t you know what I mean?? So buy spy puts and you’ll make a million dollars
bulls really waited all night to see that rally evaporate in an instant.

DAYUM!

p.s we'll retest 358 tho get out while you can
Thank you
ayyyyy, AYRO master pumper checking in.

TL/DR: buy shares or very long dated calls

Short report on TTCF was withdrawn. Tripled my position in it during yesterday’s fake dip.
4 interns could make a video chat program, sure. But they would struggle to scale that program to the hundreds of millions of customers that ZM has. In terms of competiton, ZM competes with Cisco. Microsoft and Google are less than 15% of the global video market. Cisco is dog shit in comparison and recently lost its 50%+ market share to ZM. Cisco sits at less than 38% now and ZM is the market leader.
Get over to r/investing with your 500 shares you poor ass europoor
Right, I understand through bad/good experience with earnings about volatility and again timing the bottom is too hard so, weeklies and even monthlies are hard af to time so I just try to get a good enough dip with low volatility and buy way out. Seems the only way to me, other than meme stocks lol
Cramer said RH traders cured rug pull.
It might as well become that mega company, just like $FB became not that ling ago

The problem I see now is that Canada is not that big of a market (by now is what they got) and yet legalized, weed has become so cheap to produce (under $1/gram). I believe you have to sell cars/phones/services that are expensive to make it to the billions.

Well, I should’ve held my PLTR calls but I have a couple hundred shares so fuck it
It has to make a move today. Hopefully up to $18.

Any good 0dte day plays or is everything going to dump like every Friday?
Very, very big. I think im up 30k pre-open, 50k overall. Going to offload half my shares and go $10k in to BRQS. Keeping the other half free until I retire, and letting the options ride to expiry, where I might decide to exercise and hold. How about you buddy?
What we playing today? NIO, AYRO, SOLO?
It's my first day with unlimited gay trading I don't know where to start. No way this is gonna go tits up 🌝

It's a double edge sword. They will do well with distribution but they also fall into the "Covid" stock category. Meaning if Covid is curtailed, the sentiment is Covid stocks will go down because consumer will go out and shop instead of bunker home and buy online. 

TL/DR: no one knows.
ayro bros
Fewer and fewer sellers wanting to make a quick buck
When rug pull?
Maybe sell some and take some profit.
Not if its offset by 0.0000001 seconds and its slow or fast by like 0.0000001 seconds a day
Ayro is the redneck version of solo.

Remember nio bros, it's now pltr bros
I mean call it what you want. Bears aren't in shambles when futures are red.
PLTR ready to take off and hit $21 today, I can feel it
Every EV stock mooning besides the 2 I have weeklies in TSLA and NIO
I dont atm bro dont feel left out.
IMO, because NKLA products are a systems engineering project, they can be put together successfully even if it's only at a concept stage right now. The only real issues are of value, as in how much value and cost does their approach represent.  

I understand the sticking point now in an agreement between GM & NKLA is one of mutual respect between the companies. GM is apparently holding out for a much bigger share of NKLA if they engage in the partnership. If GM gets that, it means that NKLA stocks would be worth less as they divide a smaller pie.

Right now, I think it's a gamble, with slightly better odds than a raffle ticket but good payoff. And if NKLA actually lifts successfully, that will lift confidence in the entire EV sector, which would be good for EV investors. 

That's why I think The Deep meme works -- the guy is basically a loser but still a hero

I wish brokerage accounts would send you free champagne when you reach the elusive -100%. If I make a trading platform that absolutely roasts you when you lose money, would you switch to mine?
It's all about the volatility. Look at the Black Scholes formula for options pricing. Options on stocks that swing wildly day to day are expensive.
Get it baby.
If everyones is buying, who are they buying from?
How you feeling big man???
So unlimited day trades on options?
GME shares need to become the new meme around here, its seriously the best opportunity I have ever seen to squeeze a stock to the moon

Can people update here what mnuchin says.. I don’t have TV subscription
Futures are flat
I took profit yesterday. No one was ever upset at a profit. Sell, wait for a dip and buy back in.

Realistically? Yes it’s way overbought rn and should plummet any day
When is the IPO?

When is the contract coming? It’s been speculated that it will come for the last several months... still hasn’t.
Go far back in my comment history where I schooled another idiot when pton was $60 so yea these bags are heavy with $$
Thanks. I was just making sure.
Dude's trading Pogs on the playground.

Where my “can I bum a CIIG” gang at? All I see are PLTR retards
Why do I wake up early just to watch my gainz get clapped
By funneling using non-profit did you mean people can funnel the non profit money to relatives/friends/themselves? If this is doable, that explains why so many rich people have their own non-profit organizations.
Congrats, you're going to make money.
Why did Burry dump it?
It’s up 2% pre market
Not on robinhood so it technically doesn't exist
Fuck that hold it, I got December 18th 295 calls and most likely will add January calls for OTM
Yes.

You really are a fucking idiot. You think most population care about being roided and in the gym 24*7? Why is planet fitness insanely successful with their lunk alarms and pizza Wednesdays? Yes a gym which offers pizza for free.. Cause they appeal to the majority population . Your regular mom and pop with a decent income don't have the time or inclination to go to a gym to see your broke student ass there. Not everyone who works out is looking to go zyzz levels. I'd never buy a pton personally but I know a majority who does
Thats incorrect, a clock that is too fast or too slow will eventually have the time line up. 

If the real time is currently 8 am, and the broken clock reads 9 am but is going 2 times as fast, you can solve for what time will produce the same on both clocks with 8 + x = 9 + 2 x, which can still happen despite a negative X because the time on the clock resets and is locked between 12pm and 12am.

The only thing my tiny brain knows is that your unemployment numbers are wrong. We are at 6.9% or 12 million unemployed. Still a lot more than last year sure but it's not as bad as your data implies and it's been trending downwards. We'll have to see what the increasing numbers will do though. 

The only stocks even doing all that well are tech stocks and you briefly touch on and dismiss. Are you not seeing that the real-world tech economy is booming? Online retail has been hitting end of year holiday numbers since March. AMD and Nvidia have both seen over 10 times the demand than they have before. The only thing potentially holding back the economy at this point is manufacturing but even that has ramped back up. We might see another blip but with 3 vaccines coming on the market it certainly won't be like the one in March.

You're banking data is also ignoring that after the spike in July, the number of banks tightening lending requirements drops 40% back to 37% ish.

Things aren't great but your post has several point that makes things look worse than they are.

1. I’m 18 2. You don’t have to be fully invested you can make that 30% yearly swing trading or shorting selling. 3. Doesn’t fucking matter how you make that 30% just make it. If you see the volatility nowadays you would be surprised. If you’re a pure autist, you can dump 1 mil into a 500m market cap stock and wait for it to jump 30% as a fellow autist low cap mid cap stocks jumping 30% in a ducking day is common 4. Doesn’t matter what market you’re in, if you’re smart you will make money both ways.
No, because it just hit all time high and s&p inclusion isn’t till 21st

In reading more of your post though, yes I agree some of these smaller companies seem like pure pump and dumps.
Tesla is overvalued, but they have products, and very good products at that.

Enron had no product or service.

gonna stop fucking around with silly earnings plays and shit and throw all my money into PLTR leaps

Why don't you go ahead and do it on some 0DTEs and tell me how it goes.
he's a dumbass bear, let him do what he wants
Price and yields (interest rate) are inverse. The higher the price (demand) the lower the yield.

Looking into it a bit more he lost ~50% ~$1.3m in ONE WEEK--the last week of October--and has been slightly recovering since. There is some loss porn in the "month end update" for October--he lost ~$367k the day he posted it.
Why so defensive man.. chill.
Yup. next week though..

I wouldn’t get into metals quite yet tbh. I don’t think they’ll react well to the cares act news. Would wait until someone starts stimulustalks.exe again

I am planning on getting into metals as well, but it’s got further to dip I think

How many times do we have to teach you this lesson gay bears
If Big Nick uses it, we use it
Lol Jesus 🤣
any reasoning? or just because you think market will tank in general?
Dont do that. PLTR is a key part to our national defense strategy and is only going to expand. But sell anyway because im sure youre ass sweats on a 1% loss on your market order and its probably too stressful for you.
NKLA would be -8% pre-market if I didnt buy puts

50 million doses ready in December, 40 million people over age 65 in US. one word: Capitalism, Pfizer will make sure if you want it you got it...before Moderna vaccinates you
Theta boys show up to the party?
He's right tho. Look at the dude who turned $4K into $400K on well timed FSLY 0DTE puts. Thats the glorious beauty of options. You can turn $100 into $100K with a perfectly timed option on a perfectly timed stock. For example if you bought a 3 week long lowest strike put on wirecard right before the fraud came out and the stock dropped from $51 to $0.70 in a matter of 3 weeks. That would easily be a 1000x bagger.

&#x200B;

Take V for example and assume the same thing will happen to them. The 18th December $70 strike puts are currently $5 a piece. With a max profit of $7000 if they go bankrupt by that date, if you buy 20 of them thats $140K.
What a fuckin wild week for Chinese EV. Congrats to everybody that held.

I hope today PLTR ends 19.99, 19.49 or 18.99. Worst case is 18.49 or 17.99. 

Just want to see the weeklies get expired for not contributing by buying and holding shares. 

Might be cruel to suggest that but if more of yall buy, hold and not panic sell like a retard, the lesser available shares are out there for selling and this drives the price up more.
today will not be red, pfizer is asking for emergency use that will make the vaccine available in december. When the FDA decides at the end of the day to allow emergency use or not will decide if we are red or green this weekend
Boxed.
Yeah fuk the bears
If you're still holding FCEL, don't look away for too long. Shit could sell off hard

If you are not generally unlikable, then regularly posting on this thread is literally free karma
See all the retards here posting gains from the calls they bought? Somewhere else there’s a million fools who bought calls that expired worthless. If you own 100 shares of an underlying you can sell a call contract against it. This means that someone has the right but not the obligation to buy your shares from you at the strike price on the date of expiration. If you need strike and expiration explained you should leave. Now. You pocket the money for the contract and if the share price is higher than the strike price you sell the shares for the agreed upon amount. More often than not, stonks go sideways and you keep your shares and pocket the contract value. PLTR is hot which means people are paying high premiums for the contracts right now so you’ll turn your shares into an active income stream on top of the asset value of owning them. You can do this every single week. Smart people reinvest their contract value, by more shares, sell more contracts.
They can actually communicate with Sauron
Fuck off with that fear mongering. 

Very large institutions own NIO, not just mom and pop investors. 

If the Chinese gov did that to a high profile company like NIO, investor money would flee China and cause their foreign investments and markets to collapse. Mutually assured destruction for $68 billion? Dream on 🌈🐻

Okay firstly buddy I made no mention whatsoever of Americans versus Europeans - you’re doing that all by yourself. 

Secondly, it’s simply scientifically proven that large percentages of a population wearing masks consistently reduces the spread. For example look at some of the Asian countries that literally never had to lock down because everyone already wears masks and are used to it

err, This deserves a requote.
To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to get that reference..
This is not like a 30 year fixed mortgage. It is a bond. The bond price will vary with interest rate. It starts off as negative interest but effective can climb any time.

I find your ignorance hilarious
I mean on a day chart! Not 30% pullback!
Not how that works buddy
Just roll to a farther expiry
I have to watch that on Vanguard all the time. Annoying AF.
yeah holding puts on some trash is a good way to sort of hedge your calls, insane how people think you have to be fully bearish or bullish
Only bulls, fuck 🌈🐻

No shit. every single place has an increase in cases which means places that wear masks more often are also increasing along with places that don't wear masks as often. You're blaming it on Americans and them wanting freedom but what about all the Europeans?
Thank you 🙏

What news would make PLTR shoot up 10 dollars?🤔🤔
ITS PREDATORY LENDING. I lend you 100 million knowing you cant pay it back. SO now you become a china puppet they have done it to so many countries.
Apparently all the bears are dead. Short interest is record low 😔 RIP 🐻🐻‍❄️🐼
Mnuchin is a dirty little ratfuk. He wants to suck the liquidity out of the markets
That wasn't fiddy
PLTR is a pumped up stock that has many "goals" that are far off and nothing really to justify its current price trend. TL/DR: don't buy.
Options or stock? If stock then at least you are not loosing money which puts you in the top 0.0001% of this sub
good idea.
Relax druski
It was 3 location like 200 each! I didnt go out last week, was fuked up because of casino losses!
why don't airlines move much premarket?
How the fuck is this up to 8 premature
It usually dips in the morning or at points later in the day. Especially when it has pre-market gains. By usually I mean these past 4 days that I’ve bought in and check... 

Might dip but careful with weeklies. PLTR makes sense as long term play. And if you’re going long term it doesnt make much of a difference if you buy at 19 or 18.5.

No
New to options. Could you sum up what covered calls are?
They were listed yesterday. Probably not ready yet
They solved the most important EV problem and also found a way to capitalize it:

It's called BAAS - Battery As A Service. They invented a system that let you drive in, press a button on your app, and have the batery changed in 3 min's. [This is how it works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTXptUuKGrc) You know why all those Boomers don't want to get an ev? Becuase "muuh, range is not big enough and i don't want to wait for 3 hours until car is charged". They solved it: drive in, drive out - you're good to go. They don't just sell the car of the future, they sell the fuel stations of the future with it. It already works in china.
And trading platform.
Rotation doesn’t make a difference if the whole market crashes due to the a lack of government provided liquidity which is what Mnuchin is pushing for
Have you posted it yet?
One of us one of us
probably both
Keep interest rates low long enough and this is what you get. Not that the Fed has many options available though. This said, borrow at 2%  3% 4% if you must and invest!

After yesterday, was thinking of doing a pages long, deep dive DD on QE (stimmi), money, inflation, DXY, gold, stocks, ‘the coming crash’ etc.   


Truth: definition of QE, what it is - no agreement. What are the rules of QE / what can banks do / what they cannot - no agreement. What are the effects of QE - no agreement. 

Truth: QE is shifting deck chairs on the Titanic. Iceberg still out there but it is not certain the ship will ever hit it.   


Truth: no one has a fucking clue. No one.   


Truth: we are almost entirely and utterly dependent on sentiment AKA ‘animal spirits’.   


That‘s it.

Lol yes. Coincidence that all these EV’s are going parabolic the closer their contracts get to expiration? No. From the NIO run people have been buying everything EV related. Gamma is getting higher on all of these contracts because expiration is getting closer and monthly contracts are only available which is forcing MM’s (not brokers apologize) to buy more of the underlying driving prices higher. This is not a healthy run.

Typo. It’s 25 years and stock you are looking at is not common stock but preferred warrant on OTC I believe.
Honest answer: with the new president taking over and having the opinions he has on fossil fuels, the market is betting that EV is going to be forced onto it.
Colorado. Miami least bad part of Florida
Short answer: you'd be surprised
Looks like total trash compared to MW/Warzone
What about Colorado Springs? I’ve been eyeing that, I know it’s sort of an older town I’ve only been once. Not sure I want to get an apartment in the city opposed to a house

NIO is a shithole company that sells cars that other people make. No groundbreaking shit here and they’d have to sell millions of cars to justify current valuation. Tesla is a bit different because they are involved in other industries as well so it makes sense they trade a little higher but it’s still insanely overvalued because of autists like you who chase gains based on charts and memes. 400 pre split was overvalued to anyone who wasn’t retarded but people underestimated the power of stupid people buying at crazy valuations. Tesla could be trading at 5 trillion market cap next year but wsb autists would still be buying it because the stock seem to go up and that’s all the DD needed. I still have my original shares which I bought at pre split $190 just so you know I’m not some salty ass mf
anyone knows what time NIO is unveiling its new car?

Well, the stock market is forward looking and most people agree that its pricing in 6-8 months. So in 6-8 months it will still be relevant. If you want to short it go for it BB.

You’re likely to see a rotation out of value and selling across the board, then when tech is 10% lower from now you’ll see buying. Tech has had horrendous volume and price action all week. No one is buying the top here.
Only November 19thers will remember
My account of puts fucking blown up again fuck I’m tired of betting against the economy
When Costco is out of their toilet paper brand DO NOT GET the Scott’s brand.  Get the more expensive one.  Shit is not worthy of a portajohn
A company which will be relevant for a year doesn't reflect a 120B valuation, especially while the actual service can be programmed by 4 interns in a few weeks. Since the market is always "forward looking", in this case it should be dead clear that this company has no future and will never be able to compete with Microsoft and Google.
But it would be top trending on Stocktwits for an eternity, those Buffett-worshipping weirdos
what are we pumping today boys?
For the longest time, when I saw people say "the futures red!" I thought it was some kind of clairvoyant joke.

My 2 cents: ANY EV underdog story right now lifts the entire sector.
Yup. It’s going too fast though. I need to get more money into it and I don’t have any!

NIO to moon!! XPEV to Mars. CIIC to uranus.
Well there should always be someone out there, but if there isn’t, well, idk. That’s why shares are a good idea
Lucky if we even reach 360. 357 looks like the hill you die on.
It’s going to take time to get it to everyone, there are billions of doses that need to be given and only certain people will get it at first.

Just because a vaccine might be available 1) it's going to take time to manufacture and get it to the people that are sick and 2) convincing people that aren't sick to take it... there are some significant trust issues out there with this virus.

The tunnel vision here is hilarious. You don't think the USA sees china as a threat which is why we are constantly trying to fuck with them, spew atrocity propaganda about literally anything they breathe on just to continue diverting human rights issues away from us and more onto them, to the point where we try to limit their capitalistic behaviors of technology under the guise of 'deception, cheating' even literally every other country, including the UK, disagrees?

We are a salty nation that is scared of losing our influence to a country we tried so hard to shut down and break apart. Many countries know this now, except obviously its less than intelligent citizens

You're nearing fomo territory. I would not be surprised if they hit $25 by year end but they're promising long-term growth, not fast memery. Buy shares
The ability to pull out is definitely necessary to avoid long term financial losses.

Doubt you’re gonna see the $100 jump like that time.

Which means it’ll definitely be like $150.
I've been heavy on the march 5c since they were 0.9 each haha. Holding those for dear life.
PLTR is still the only option
It kind of sucks having to wake up at 5:30 AM to prep for market open. I live on west coast and work remote in Florida and it’s nice!
The old saying actually goes: The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

You got the context right but pretty much none of the actual words.
Because there's still a ton of liquidity in the market, and they're only asking for $500b of the trillions that the Fed has at its disposal. A drop in the bucket really, and it won't even be in effect until January, and the Fed can still reapply for more if needed. It really isn't that big a deal.

I agree, $600 is gonna be a hell of a ride for such a short expiration. Maybe set it back a little further
there was a news today about a partnership with apple
I would like to counter with a few points as to why I’ve been invested in JMIA since Monday.       

1) medicine is fucked up. Pharma companies will likely push vaccine sales to Africa in a pay to vaccinate campaign in which studies will be done on the vaccinated in Africa to ensure safety(people in Africa are less likely to sue for large amounts of money in case there is an unknown side effect).         

2) Most African nations speak English as a first language. I’ve met people from S Africa, Ghana and Nigeria. I can say they all speak perfect English with a slight accent, but still speak it significantly better than people in southern America and the Ghetto.         

3) they are one of the only companies with the infrastructure to distribute the vaccine quickly.       

4) road infrastructure means less when their civilians are willing to walk a thousand miles for a vaccine. It will be more about setting up distribution areas in major cities to make it more widely available. 200m vaccines is enough for 5 countries? I’ll take those distribution numbers.      

Tbh, when I invested in them I only did so because their IV was one of the highest and I did no DD on it. I just realized that it was within a channel I felt comfortable investing in and doubted e-commerce would go down while lockdowns kept increasing. I’m also dumb enough to take company based in as company operates in.... .... .... sometimes you can be wrong and right at the same time?
What do they do
RH doesn’t allow that lol
Pretty sure it'll be back up next week, but I don't wanna buy anything until I understand this news better

Well that isn't quite true... Tencent is also -fucking massive- and has traded on US exchanges for a long time so has good books.

NIO it remains to be seen but it's worth mentioning their main source of funding is again Tencent.

Tencent and Alibaba have their hands in basically all of Chinas hot startups. Either by incubating them directly, them being started by ex-Alibaba/ex-TC employees or through invesntment (i.e TC owning stake in NIO and BABA owning stake in XPEV).

Technically BIDU is part of the "BAT" triumvirate but it's sort of lost it's way after becoming "Google of China" it actually morphed into "Yahoo of China" and is declining in relevancy.
CCL why you gotta announce delays before market open on a Friday? You're supposed to wait till after close to announce that shit.

Don’t have positions in PTON but they are way beyond taped iPad to bike. They have properly integrated across devices and have the best instructors, using it feels like magic. That’s said, I’m not buying PTON since fitness brands tend to follow the buy-what’s-cool-that-year trend, people might decide PTON is so 2020 and yoga mats are back in 2021.
Load up 12/18 puts today on all these EV’s with monthly options. Once all these 11/20 contracts expire there will be no reason for the brokers on the other side of the trade to hold the underlying

PLTR is definitely gonna close deep red today to kill all the options expiring today

Dems work with pedophiles who also eat childrens. The only one who fight and can stop them is 🥭. They want to know what the dems and soros did with all the children and are glad that donnie is fighting them.

They want some justice in the world, but Rudy isn't able to bring back justice, because the deep state is too powerful.

Baba bleeding out before open? I’m shocked 😮
NIO was never under the radar stock to begin with. I knew it a little before IPO and plenty did because I remember how big the trading volume was and the insane valuation it traded at until it crashed completely because it was and still is a garbage Chinese company. I had something small like 5k ready to buy it at around 2$ but decided not to only because there were some shenanigans with their earrings report. I don’t remember exactly what it was but I think they didn’t report them on time or something sketchy like it

I’ve been vale gang for months (even before the infamous egg man post). Consistent but slow money maker during that time, as long as your calls were at least a few weeks out. I’ve almost doubled the size of my portfolio with their 20% run up over the last couple weeks. It’s been glorious.

Well neither does 90% of WSB so yeah
No, says CRSR, TSLA and AMD
Have you tards even looked at it pre-market? This stock IPO'd a month and a half ago. What's with all the autists asking if they missed out or if it's still a good idea like it's some dogshit stock that is gonna pump and dump? This is a casino, roll the dice like the rest of us!

Don't even fucking bother. Games nowadays are release uncompleted and full of bugs, you have to download 100gb+ game files before you can even use them, and then there's frequent 30gb+ updates so that there's a 20% chance that everytime you find time to sit down and play a game, it turns out you have to wait 3 hours for it to download and copy the update

Because 358 is the new top this week. We'll break past it on some BS news today but it likely won't hold. We'll be lower 350s next week

Open bullish short term positions and bearish long term positions. 

At worst youll lose a little each week to the bear positions, but if/when there is a huge pullback theyll print heavily. 

In fact, if you play the swings right both bull and bear positions can print. Just close bear positions at the weekly low and close the bull positions at the weekly high.

Fuk it, I'm in you fucking retarded, bastard alien hybrid, mother fucker!  I cried while reading your strategy mother fucker!
Yea it does cause you look at the 2 week /1 month graph and it's up 90%. Think longer term though. It has a lot of room (thinking pt 60 at least) as it's niche is gaming hardware and platform for pro gaming. Plus with esports subscription (think they plan to teach gamers at all levels), revenue will be off the charts
It’s in the realm of possibility to work. Good luck soldier.

And that’s why TSLA is currently $500/share with EPS of fifty. one. cents.  Our governments are going to decarbonize the economy tomorrow or maybe the day after.

the fact that so many people use this BS garbage app is actually depressing.
Dump CIIG at open?
I own both stocks, but I think XPEV has more upside.
yes, xpev will surpass nio soon.
It depends on how today goes tbh. If we see confidence in buying over selling we’re going to be seeing people holding over the weekend. Well know which way the market is going by 11:30ish. My prediction is yesterday we leveled out when there was nothing but bad news. Didn’t crash or anything crazy so I think we open higher today and at least hit ATH on Tesla, climb on Nio, nkla if this new price target is real will climb like 3-5% and probably a slight gain on amazon and Apple.
If you don't like the chart, change time axis

Bears say have patience loser stonk. You die soon.
It's a risky play. If you want to be a pussy you can wait for a drop, but that might never happen. If you want to make a play then see if it can hold 500+ if it can  hold 500 it'll go higher. It's really going to be an end of day thing imo. If it holds 500 by end of day today convincingly you can probably look at a 510C weekly.
In other words. dump 10 seconds in after retards fomo  incoming

Just a reminder that Palantir (PLTR) is considered a super tech company along with 13 other big names such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Amazon, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Cisco etc.

Why would a 30B market cap company be admist the 100B to 2T companies doing there? Palantir definitely has insane growth potential to be there.
Before the month ends, something will happen to jumpstart the end of year rally.
Market cap.

Bro chill out.  This sub is about being retarded and embracing it.  You’re flaming everyone in sight and you’re not even joking.  Aside from not being able to shit on the left or say the big F word the toxicity is the dumbest thing that’s happened to this place.  I honestly think censoring “hate speech” is what leads to f@ggots like you spreading your bullshit vibes because all the people that like to shit talk without getting their feelings hurt bail out when they’re not allowed to shit talk in ways that are clearly over the top.  It turns into this smarmy twatty passive aggressive bullshit internet arguing.

Congrats on tesla being 500$.
That’s where we disagree I think the best approach in the ev market is to go for luxury cars because you can’t compete with Tesla on cheaper car, it’s a great mistake 

Tesla has like 20% vehicle margin, they make theirs owns cars, owns batteries they even have a mine. If xpeng starts to price aggressively by lowering the price Tesla will do the same without struggle

Honestly, Nio and Alibaba are the only two worth trusting
After Zhang successfully kidnapped Lee's son, he earned 430 million HKD from ransom, in which he quickly lost in casino in Macau.

Suffering from poverty, Zhang ask for advice, and the only advice from Lee is to be a good person. 

In other words, no real investment advise and Zhang being an autist tried to bomb the Stanley prison. His plan failed miserably and he tried to escape to mainland China, where he got caught and were executed (it is rumoured that the decision is made because Lee hold grudges and bribed the related officials to give the punishment).

I have a colleague who like to talk to ne about stocks. He has been in the stock market for years and market cap seem foreign to him. Those conversations are so painful. I really don't know how he can't understand that. He dropped like 40k in tsla in late august saying that since the stock was splitting it was a great opportunity to ride back to his 'actual price of 2.3k'. The fucker has a degree to be an actuary and he is a plain retard. Beside that he is pretty cool.

You use that word , but i dont think you know what it means
So I'm supposed to buy AYRO, TSLA, PLTR at open?
Crashing where? to 19.34?
On a serious note, loaded 50 $20 Viatris calls for January. Thoughts?
Up 2% still lol. Comments like these are how you know we’re almost at the top
Yes please.

Makes sense to me. That’s my DD for the day.

If shares, yes. Sell some covered calls to bring your cost basis down, kind of.
Hehe whoops

Yeah I bought back in AH last night after it dumped
Just fading into the night 🙄
An excellent read, and some very valid points made. I’ll be reconsidering my TSLA investments based on how prolific these traps will be.
wait for morning dip then buy
PLTR the gift that keeps on giving
you should still buy it at 194.30

The only big investor is Soros, who regrets buying Facebook and Google back in 2018 too.

It's financials is horrible mainly to trick the algorithm by posting super negative one-off revenue. Its revenue has been growing, and its profit has been less negative too.

The pump may be quite crazy right now but remember ebr, they are involved in the COVID tracing, and vaccine distribution, using their Tiberius platform.

Microsoft and Adobe were B2B with their software, Customizing for big customers and struggle to break even in the 1980s. Theyve since commercialise to the public consumers and look at where they are at now: Literally 200000% increase since the 1980s.

Palantir is on its way, from being CIA focused, to expanding to government  military, health and geography, to expanding to commercial business clients, if they make a jump to consumer and scale from there, it would easily be a multi trillion company. This is likely priced in already nonetheless...

NRZ GANG STAND UP!!!!!

I mean, there's a bunch of us in PLTR. And NIO. And SOLO. All the posts are signs for intended for rainbow bears to right their ways
My calls expiring today don't give a shit about market cap
Yeah light sensitivity
NIO had a lot of hype in the run-up to the trio of Chinese EV earnings, but at a very high level I understand the play. They're big in the Chinese EV space and China is, relatively speaking, aggressively pushing to decarbonize its auto industry. The price target for the three companies is much higher than where those stock prices sit right now. They've got a lot of room to grow and the backing of the state (as far as I understand, which is not very much, mind you).  


On the other hand, NKLA has not made any cars yet and is mired in controversy. However, GM seems to think that there is promise there. Do we know better than GM? Probably not.   


Out of curiosity, did you get swept up in the initial NKLA fervour? And if you do go in again, do you think you'd buy stock or options?
SNAP calls anyone?
Mms gonna close it under 20.
lmao is this real

What’s that weird fake money?
They do have autonomous driving. They employ roughly 1000 software engineers, their software was the main selling point to ups. Predictive braking and lane switching, fully autonomous, and obviously fully electric.

BABA black sheep, have you any wool?
Dont go long, just hold it untill it hits $3-4 and run
No, cause they'll likely be in the money due to ridiculous runup, dealers will have to hedge by buying more stock otherwise risk infinite losses. If a dump happens though and these call positions start getting closed it could end nasty to the downside, however I think most will diamond hand this shit during the day at least.
Or just buy $tsla. U can’t lose
I’ll take that!
Doubtful for it to be today. I’m thinking next week is when we start seeing any significant pullback.

I'm a huge fan of tendie town
The price has gone up way too much to be as simple as a pump and dump, a lot of it has to do with the price of oil, and a Biden presidency. A lot of people are confident in it's future, and they appear to be heading for profitability by 2022.

Need KNDI to step its game up since I don’t have BLNK anymore. 

Also baba, stop playing games
Its also a garbage nothing company. I say this having made a mint on it already. It has no long term value though
If we’re doing a reversal from red to green this morning and carry this through for a strong trade day monday is gonna be green. Given we don’t get news like Elon has died due to the combustion of his Tesla or something. Tuesday however I foresee significant pullback before a continued rally into tech on late Wednesday or Thursday.
China is rotating the pumps so the fraud doesn’t seem like it’s streamlined.

You’re a true wsb autist. Just because there’s hype about EVs doesn’t mean they are napkin companies. Arcimoto has been around for years and they are slowly starting to ramp production. It’s a niche company but has enough demand for their products. If you’d listen to their earnings call on Monday you’d see that they never said anything to hype the company up, it’s you the WSB autists chasing any gains in this bs market
You are definitely describing a % of people going in. What % though is important. What do you think?

Yawn 🥱 you got nothing to lose. Real degenerates yolo calls with rent money.

There profit margins increasing each quarter dramatically, and that is there business model (selling cheaper cars then NIO and Tesla) look at the acceleration in sales from q3 to q4, Luxary cars can only go so far.. there’s a reason why jpm said “Xpeng will dominate the chiniese ev market” there future sales will make up for there lower profit margins
It’s “relief” illiterate dumb fuck. You don’t even know what respite means.

And that's only 20% of the total shares, The rest will be unlocked in a few months . Might be retardedly wrong on this so please feel free to correct me.
I only care that it’s up 100% lol
XPEV announced their new car or some new autonomous stuff I think
[deleted]
Go long if you’re getting in now. Def room to go up but I don’t see it going above $25 by EOY
BABA needs to go up
Yeah no one likes stocks the squeeze %50 in 4 days *cough HTZ *cough AMC *cough GME *cough KODK
Palantir is moving close to 20! 

Let’s take 20 !
Depends how many you got? Don’t forget to put the cover on after you’ve put them in
Sorry my bad.
Can i have the dump once in trading hours so I can get rid of my puts.
Why would it crash? Only new or recently news, it can pullback to short but i dont see it going again below $16 even in a red day
The autist hive mind has convinced me to go big into GME shares today, just wait until BofA has to cover their short postions. It's gonna be the tastiest most delcious money I ever made....fucking hate BofA
It depends on your broker. It also depends on whether you want to exercise.
Thats right
Looks like they’re just taking some profit. If it accelerates could be something
> If this isn't the top, it is close to it. $366.77 will very likely be the high for SPY for the year, and will soon unwind downwards.

> Timing can be difficult. My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.

If you truly believe that we have seen the top, you've got to open the bulk of your positions now brother. What is the sense in waiting  to sell at 340, 320, 300, 280? You know how it will be, if it happens. Wild and chaotic, with huge pullbacks that come out of nowhere, and you won't be able to tell a pullback from the bottom. You say 'If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.'. Then most of your stops are going to get hit on the way down, and you will end up taking losses. Look how cheap you can go short for right now. You have a natural stop in mind and can play to that. Better to sell now at 358 with a stop around 367 rather than selling later with a much higher risk reward
Who exactly Soros? are you dumb enough not to read between the lines? CNN is just bitching.

Grow weed. Sell it to Mexico. Come on now
It might be early don’t trust futures until 8:29am
You dug her up?
$MJ
Wow unique strategy, no one has thought of that
RIOT been treating me well, can't bring myself to buy shitcoin directly.
Exactly why the next move will be big
Shhhhhhh 🤫🤫🤫
420.69mm
They don't, they just push the car from behind.
Not in the USA but Manitoba Canada is increasing restrictions today. We have a 14% infection. No socializing with anyone outside your house and only essential items can be sold. Like u can’t go to Walmart and buy clothes or a soccer ball only groceries. Schools are open tho
Market cap brehhhhh
!Remindme 1 day 'owh yeee'
I did that on your moms chest
That’s conservative
Basically helps government agencies spy on people. Not exactly the type of company we should root for but money is money I guess.
[removed]
Really think it’ll go to $20? 🤔
Yeah, Friday's sell offs are over, we going to moon today to 55+
Useful how? Genuine question
MagSafe by Appld
Mine is 80% PLTR and the rest is tech.. am I in trouble? (shares, I'm a UK autist and options don't really easily exist over here)
Going to drop at open for sure though.
🤡
why?
why is XPEV parabolic but NIO is flat af
Mexico getting closer still to legalizing weed. What do????
Big investors are leaving it, it has horrible financials. Why the pump? What's the upside? Serious question.
Just with more autistry
Happy Birthday..what’s your dick size?
It's called shitcoin for a reason. Don't get burned like people did a few years ago
Not true DD. Just that I think it's a pretty innovative product that's niche enough to have a strong most, but big enough to demand a higher market cap from AYRO.
Who?
Yes, WSB literally can pump enough to affect 35b market cap lol.
I wish I knew which one of these piece of crap fraud EV pump and dumps to fomo into. 😕
You’re gonna see a lot of me too sentiment and honestly its not a good thing. Dunno what to think about it but I’m betting on the winners so they can keep winning
i woke my wife’s bf up laughing so hard in the middle of the night
I kinda want to hold, but I’m a little wary of it’s spike and then quick drop a few months ago...
SPY is gonna do that 3:35 dump today I just know it.
why in the fuck
[deleted]
How to see pre-market price?
I bought $8k in shares and 2k in options split between Marathon and Occidental in the past month so take this how you want, but buying calls/shares are literally guaranteed 20-100% gains within the next year. Internet coin gonna take off soon too
Happy birthday fellow autism
Alexa, translate this Virgin gibberish.
I bought nkla puts all day yesterday as it went up and I will do the same today if idiots continue to buy it. That said knowing this market it will continue so who knows
Cant wait for all these tickers to get thanos snapped on the next pullback. Sorry bears no time soon
I’m gonna be straight with you. Just don’t play Tesla. If you try and short it you will lose 80% of the time and if you try to do calls it only works if you either go long or get in before it starts its rally. Otherwise it’s just a blatant gamble.
Oh shit, the other 848059584884 comments didnt convince me, but this did.
Go to bed red, wake up green. Happy Friday you fucks!
It’s going to crash right into the clouds on its way to the moon.

The predict test for his theory is if spy breaks 366. He predicted its not going to hit its ATH again for at least a year.

Yes please so I can buy more!
Ayro is a pump and dump, be careful
Sell FL calls at open or nah
Every day for the past few weeks has seen +0.3% or something PM and then it just bleeds all day then 0.3% AH - EVERY FUCKING DAY
Going to 100k by spring 

Book it
should i switch to calls? i’m scared i’ll get boned at open
[deleted]
PLTR has a float of 1 billion shares. Can this shit just keep mooning?
For all of you asking if you should buy into PLTR. This is how you handle WSB meme stocks. But super OTM strikes a few months out for cheap. If it continues to Meme, you make money, if it doesn’t, you only lose a couple hundred. It’s a win win
BA climbing again next week?
SIT DOWN when you do it
I was told there would be blood.
Aaa, I see. Ty🤣
Nobody cares about that shit stock.
this
When everything got choppin in half last year march 16th boxl trippled in value. Shits hitting the fan again. This is wallstreet bets, not r/investing. No ones going long here. Its a quick come up tbh

I’ve had money in it for years. Made me a lottttt more money than stonks ever have
squirter
With that attitude you'll hit a 0 bagger in no time
Happy Birthday and Happy GreenDay To You!
Servus from Germany. I once used Trading212 because on the first side itsInteresting  because of the no commission on orders, but if you look deeper there is are 2 big problems.

1. Trading 212 has a big spread.
2. The banks where your money is deposit are in Romania and in England and is  secured up to 27k € (dont know if it is for Switherland too)

In the German WSB community is mostly trade republic used.
If you’re not on PLTR for it’s launch today you’re missing out.
Since we all seem to be aware of stockwits we can come clean guys. This is us as well on stockwits, this is just our personality when we can use memes.
Well boys, gig is up. Wife wanted to know why I've withdrawn $3k this month from our checking. Looks like I'll have to start using my RH debit card to pull cash for my medical marijuana.
I have one. It's a hedge.
Got it,  buy more ice.
All I want for Christmas is to break even. Can
You do that for me Santa?
Have you tried opening the stop in the sink?
BEARS DED
If you pussies had a bit more faith in PLTR we could all make a mint but you're all gonna sell at open.
It's already parabolic
Birthday for account. See how you got a cake by your name. Today is the date you registered your Reddit.
For sure. I was just reading on 4chan a few guys out there still think Mango baby can run again in 2024. Lol. When I pointed out that he’s already destroyed his legacy by being a whining poor sport, they still thought he was acting in their best interests. You can’t fix stupid, but brainwashed maybe...
Thanks Dick Farter
They wouldn’t be able to go so fast if it weren’t for the cheetah brain
PLTR well above 19 pre-market. Let’s see if it sticks
You are of course right. Luckily a SIPP(self invested personal pension) in the UK can't be drawn until you're 55 so even with only average growth and no further contributions this should be worth 1/2 mil in 25 yrs. 
I'm planning to add £500 / month and invest in hedge funds and moderatly adventurous shares which should take this to 1million by the time I'm 55. 

While I can't do options on this type of account I still come here for share picks :D
It doesn't have to be one or the other. Is there AYRO dd?
More money pouring into a lower market cap means share price rises quicker. For example, $100 million would make NIO's share price increase by less than it would Xpeng. 

Having said that I am not sure why so many new investors are also pouring into Xpeng. I think people are just piling on all the Chinese EV right now.
Nobody here on FUBO?
5k a month ago is 7.2k now... I kinda want to put all my cash in it rather than sitting in USD in a checking account that pays dick
How come that words not banned but dog with an e at the end is? :(
I’m at work, does that count?
Happy birthday brother I personally guarantee it will be green. At least Nasdic
The four big front runners (technically 3 because pfizer and biontech are working together to develop one vaccine) all have deals in place already with various governments to sell their vaccine by the tens of millions

Moderna, pfizer, biontech, and astrazenenca are all very safe bets right now.

BLNK would’ve been like a 6-8 bagger for me , instead I settled for 3 like a loser
Happy birthday, man!

a lot of room to go.
Because largest risk to the company is bankruptcy. So guess what helps with that? Money.
Keep playing MSFT and buy me one too

I hedged my bet on Trump. I took out some of that hedge to support the growth of my new website, you should check it out: www.ChessnutCorner.com
That will also be the day they RKT announces it has produced its own vaccine that is 103% effective.
Pfizer is a shit company with sketchy leadership.  MRNA will likely have record breakouts over the coming year with their technology. I could see them being bought by GSK.  MRNA has the room to run.
Shitcoin has been killing it lately
I’m with ya! This thing just hit 20!
Normal like in free states pretty much.
Happy cake day btw. Send nudes.
Today's my birthday so by definition is has to be green today
Dont know if this is a pump and dump but I just bought.
Should have given him some extremely obscure positions and then inversed them to get it all back

So much of the world revolves around money. Can't wait to make some one day.
What happened to the sell off?
Yeah this is not very smart. Their earnings I’m pretty sure we’re better last year any a good bit. No new news. This seems like a classic pump n dump to me.
If vaccine news, then I expect tech to go red. If it’s not red then fk you
I am also planning to get out of some slow players as soon as I can cover above my position and use the cash in a bigger pot.
I've been right so far this week. Called the Boeing pump and dump premarket on my PC account, called the DKNG pump and dump premarket, called yesterday's spy bull trap premarket. 

It's not that hard. Bulls are getting fleeced and you don't even realize it

Sold aapl for loss, rolled msft to 1/15 215c. But iffy.
Going back to buying shares when I can. Starting to believe the they’re too big to have volatility worth playing options on, outside of events. Being up and down in the same tight range for weeks.

Be more intelligent with your responses. Normal people will choose to follow or not follow. Businesses and schools will be forced to follow otherwise face heavy imposed fines. Which means economy could stall like last time.

Lockdowns are scattered and not nationwide yet.

Daily reminder that pussy 🌈 🐻 losers never win in the long run. The only thing going down this week is the sweat on Giuliani’s face. Today, we model ourselves after my favorite Pokémon, Blastoise.  We have cannons about to be lit off in a sea of wet💦 🚀. I scrub this little discussion thread every day and if anything so much as goes down .5%, you guys lose your mind. 

I don’t think so. Not today. Quit being such squirmy little shisters. This is hitting the moon today 🌝 

And to the kid complaining about PLTR posts, honestly you can just skip to you Lou right on to r/investing. If I see one more post about a 1 or 2 contract position giving you a dilemma, ima lose it. If you’re not taking out cash advances, you’re not playing this game.

PLTR is going to follow in the footsteps of TSLA and go parabolic over the course of the next year 

IN AT OPEN, nerds
Idk just fucking release the evidence already if they have any, getting impatient and tired of hearing about it

When was the last terrorist attack?

Why can't you think of a date.... Because of Palantir.  That is the only catalyst that would knock this stock price down.

Also, all those liberal hippies say they want to reduce defense spending.  They're talking about troops and guns and bombs and stuff.  They aren't talking about Minority Report level AI which is Palantir.  If anything, their defense spending will only be more concentrated as years progress.
i have puts lel
We have the constitution. Fuck too much government.
Juste realized that I have a few hundred litec0ins and they went up 30%. I might not be bagholding for long!

2 95% effective vaccine's, what more news could there be?
CCL shareholders got diluted like what, 5 times already this year? The craziest thing is their public offering announced yesterday caused it to go up. Lol wtf
Hello. My real human name is Mr. PumpBot. We should all buy PLTR and send Alex Karp more hair products.  Thank you.
don't see it, which timeframe you talking about
Talk me out of buying puts on NKLA and AMD
I agree with this, I won't be shocked if it blows up to 55 but I expect it to sit at 50
I was thinking a hard dump today. Do you see otherwise for some reason?
He did not have a middle name.
Jesus AYRO is still doing its thing. Anyone done DD on it?
All jokes aside I think PLTR is gonna get an upgrade within the next week

Hell yeah
Whats happening with lockdowns in usa? Im asking as im from the uk
Over on Over/under 4 diaper changes per day.
The US dollar is the safe haven currency and where most of the world sticks their money when shit hits the fan. The rest of the world will be 🌈 🐻 and we will get this vaccine going and get some stimulus 💰, back to 100% normal in 12 months or so. Have inflation increase, grow revenue and pay that shit down with GDP growth over a long ass time. Stay invested for your long term no matter what. Go to Thailand for vacation and hookers, all is well. 

You can't trust the Chinese, they are currency manipulators and communist homos. No one even knows how much money they print every year. Last I heard, just for last year(mind you the world economy was doing extremely well) trillions of Yuan were generated, even certain parts of household and government debt exceeded 300% GDP. Why would you be printing so much fiat currency if everything is great? 

The Eurozone is very frail and their GDPs have very low growth. Euro has been floating in weakness. 

The problem with Japan is their debt load and declining population, for the YEN. Unless they can have an army of robots go to work for everyone, wipe their asses and have robot babies. 

Don't even mention Russia. High interest rates, weak currency, too many alcoholics. *women can be hot, mail order brides when your fucking all in YOLO hits, hell get 2.

Overall, as the world recovers, you will see a small normal decline in the dollar as assets trickle back into their countries of origin. Yet,  the 🇺🇸 will remain the most stable country for a long time. 

Now, if we get some 🌈 🐻  politicians in there who want to tax the shit out of everyone and give everything away for "free", then we are all fucked.
Let us know when you buy back in
Why not both?

Go away ,🌈🐻
Haven't heard about them in months.
Which one would you recommend?
galaxy gap straddle like your mum's
Reverse splits.
The hive mind is right. This is going to 30.
That’s why rates will never go up. The fed will use reverse QE to control inflation.
Up 140% on my 11/27 23.50 calls 🚀🚀
Oh good. Expected another 358 retest. Glad we got it out of the way during futes and while I was sleeping. Another bull trap day incoming

Anyone know if we have another vaccine announcement coming soon? I know we had a heads up about the moderna one

I’m eyeing a play but could just wait and get in at a better price if we get slapped with some more of those vaccine results
90% of this sub
Telos sounds like Delos from westworld. Palantir is the Rehoboam from Season 3. Moon confirmed.
Elon gonna whip out his 10 incher today
Mods
Pal-ant-ear
I tried this many a time, fren. Just make money with the rest of us and buy calls.
No idea man
Now this is pod racing.
Guess not, as they weren't very inspired in the first place picking up a name for the company.
Should I buy PLTR?  I can’t tell if people are bullish, I hardly see anyone commenting on it
It’s going to 550 within a month
Not necessarily  I'm guessing it was with FD's and made dollars on the pennies. I doubt it took 28 wins. He could do it in 1 or 2 trades if your lucky enough.
Damn Ethereu jumped big again. Wish I had more than 5% in it. Now it's like 7% of totally already.

Sick
Tesla 520 by lunch
Woke up to huge gains overnight. How long should we ride it?

Oh okay nice one!
Late 20s? You ARE a boomer
just Drove from Miami to Delaware LEGIII
YOU take that back right now young man! They do make good Photoshop lol.
Good night sweet prince
Sooooo... we did a full circle... brings my back to my main question why has xpeng surpassed NIO? Which also ISNT TOO LITERAL RETARD
I’m feeling very uneasy about the wsb PLTR euphoria
You mean your 2D girlfriend?
Is MSFT goes $225 today, I can afford an Xbox X
🌈Breasts
Just in case Soros is pissed that his puts didn't print.
Bro look at my posts.
KNDI gapping up today don’t sleep on it

TsLa Is An EnErGy CoMpAnY

What news today will push spy to 360?
You hate money
😂 have you seen the bulls
If we have four vaccines being used does that mean none of their stock goes up 400%?  Bag holding AZN
TSLA higher cap than US auto industry. I shall begin setting up puts.
$ROPE
Based profit taker
LOL

imagine being psyched because your stock went up 23% in a fucking day. You take your wife and kids out and spoil them, buy them new bikes, maybe even a car because fuck it - you just made BANK. Then waking up to that shit.

Sorry kids, Christmas is cancelled.
They nice?
I’m in my late 20s and I feel like a boomer because I don’t understand what the hell half the companies WSB loves even do. 

“You autists need to invest in XYZ, they spot weld aerospikes on to CPU’s to ensure that your FPS on Mine Sweeper can outrun a Chinese hypersonic missile. Easily a $1T dollar company.”
Don't miss the Palantir train and buy pre cum. This shit going to 25

because he's actually retarded
More like 30 end of 2020, 100 end of 2021
10 points for you. So, Xpeng's share price being higher than NIO's doesn't matter if their market cap is half of NIO's.
[removed]
when I see value
#TSLA over 500 😏
Based on all the similar situations
stem cells from umbilical cord. weekly doses. its pretty expensive but the tech is there. it combats inflammations in body. mel gibson brought his nearly dead father at 92 to panama, after it he lived till 100

cbs ceo sumnre redstone lived till 97, gates senior (a huge tall guy - tall guys dont live that long cause the strain on body is much higher) lived till 94, Murdoch is 89 and so on
I agree, especially where you reference NIO. I also don't think its gonna pop like that but will slowly rise throughout.
Wait. Isn't all Canadian money fake money?
Might do that thanks
Tls
Please explain!
A small amount isn't a yolo, right?
I'm thinking I sell my 11/27 PLTR today and hold my 12/18

Just in case there's some fuckery over the weekend/next week
Lol.. are you sure the problem is not your company?
They’re just so theatrical lmao. Deff liberal art majors.
Yes but approval isn’t today which people don’t seem to realize
As good as it gets for an autist
I got city as my free stock fromRH. Diamond hends
Another EV company?  I can’t keep track of all of them
I know several sole proprietors that got $10s of thousands each. Just people who work for themselves.  It sounds like some companies just didn’t know how to apply or went through a shitty bank.
I just wish I had more capital now for future tendies
Remind me!
until you take in the fact it's Canadian dollars.
I should’ve bought more pltr lottos
That stock go up because hyper of NIO, LI and XPENG. I do say sell before earning because it will tank but that's just me. 

People go to another stock that look like TSLA but cheaper so:

TSLA until Split ---> NIO ----> XPENG ----> LI ---> NIU.
Heard that when they were 14.
[deleted]
Im pretty sure he said 1,000,000,000 not 1,000,000
Show gf clothed first as DD.
If it does squeeze and you try to sell those calls at what you think the peak is...who is actually buying them? That's the part I don't understand.

Alternately, if you manage to time the top can you buy puts and ride it back down? Who TF would sell puts?
Who else pulled an all nighter

BABA is, as always, butt.
1-2 months was his time table he expected I think a high of $366 or something
bears are dead. the last one was shot this night when jpow heard strange noises in his garden
Amazing.  PPT will buy anything
Nobody wants to see his tits
When do you plan on buying?
stop the cap
Mods
This was NIO a few days ago
30 end of 2021? Probably there will be a few downs along the way. Long holder
Priced in.
$PLTR gonna rip today with these huge calls positions expiring today.
Lol nothing personal but I love how a man isn’t grown until he has a wife, kids, and a house. 

Bachelor life 4 Eva!
Ah yes, the old FOMO into buying high and selling low and then saying "it's just paper" when the position blows up.

Looks like he's studying the u/analfarmer2 loss Katas.

The amount of PLTR pumping in here is ridiculous. Be cautious, folks...
Why not
Hi SQ
If TSLA has another 10% face ripper today I’ll upload a picture of my girlfriends tiddies
Bears on stocktwits are so fucking annoying lol I can’t help but think they’re also members of this sub
I sold 10 recently to free up some cash. Still have many but it felt good to be able to use some of the money for something that isn’t so slow and stupid

If you have calls some hedges are never a bad thing.

My PLTR $17.5c, $19c, $25c May 2021 ready for moon mission
Stock 90% since yesterday morning. Noice😎 I've entered this morning, that shit's spookier than any deep OTM TSLA calls
Let’s go BABA crew. 

I got the 262.5. Hope we open huge. If possible I’ll sell half and ride freebies. Cost avg is 1.82
*Joker Voice*

Yea...
I can't jack off to that
Im in cuz everyone else is out
I really don’t like the way theirs cars look and even the name. Do you imagine western people saying « yeah I bought a xpeng car ? » 

Yes it will be very successful in China but I don’t have hope in their expansion in Europe. 

Nio in the other hand can have a better growth even with a market cap greater than the one of xpeng

Jealous? Yes. Still yolo tsla calls ? Also yes.
If you have a strong thesis, NKLA has a lot of play with the position it's in. Losers can be big gain. I'm sitting on shares as 3-5% of a portfolio. Won't make or break
Thank god TDA has fast withdrawals, I cut it so fucking close but I got my money straight and didn't have to pay 25% APR on a maxed out credit card

you just screenshotted my account upside down you arent fooling anyone
I’m going to wait for the first PLTR dip before buying in. It’s gone up and up. Has to dip right? RIGHT?
We are green baby
BABA. why you fade
Upvote even though i am ...mostly...bear lol
Why would it go down though? We have a handle on this virus now despite what the gloomy media says, a vaccine is coming, people are working, etc. My company instituted a pay cut in May and is reinstating full salaries 1/01/21. 

The crash in March was due to uncertainty.

Things aren’t AS uncertain anymore.
Well it’s almost there already so I missed the train lol

358 or 359. Close to the money. Just tryna scalp a few grand and then take the day off
I’m sure it’s too late to jump in now or rather too risky to end up bag holding
🤡
Don’t be mad at profiting!
PLTR to the 🌝
There's a lot of hate for them here (and it's not unearned), but EVs/hydrogen-related companies are hot right now. I don't know if NKLA is gonna pop off like, say, NIO, but I do think that it's up from here.
Love waking up and seeing Bears in shambles lol
You just made a grown ass man with kids and a house jelly for like 1 second.
Source?
EV yes
Probably? Since they filed, the information is public and they are not profitable.
Anything but another theta gang day
Pretty close in the money. Probably 358 or 359. This is just for a quick day trade, not that crazy honestly. Will cut losses quick if it goes against me
Damn nasty tits always doing us wrong
What strike price?

EDIT: saw your response. Thank you sir
I hope it rallies to 70+ again

You only make massive gains to increase those massive gains. What is a break? Seeing green pumps more dopamine into my brain than a nut

Yea. Losing an yolo and then urge to find a quality DD.
It ain’t over yet. I think we’re gonna finish higher today
Lol dam. Yeah they had EVGA FTW3 ones in stock for a couple hours on tigerdirect a couple days ago was still stupid expensive but glad I don't have to wait any more I need it for work and shit
When developed countries turn on the printers it's called stimulus. When developing countries do it it causes hyperinflation and austerity measures to be forced onto them.

Hold NIU through earnings or get rid eod?
Nio’s market cap is double xpeng’s
Calls on this kid’s future, adorable, he’s going places. 1,000,000c 1/2050
Time to long UVXY.or nah?
Could be PLTR itself using its intelligence network to manipulate its price
You know what, I’ll take the L. I was wrong, you where right. I got a little excited and read it wrong. I’m sorry.
Very much team every man man for himself. 

I’m gonna get mine, fuck the rest of you!
25k into 0dte spy calls at open. Bullish today
Thanks! :)
Is NKLA gonna be the play again soon? I'm reading that they're still on schedule for production in 2021 and their number one focus is regaining investor's trust through good management. Possibly a high risk/high reward play?
Wish? The platform you order stuff from and get completely different things than what you ordered? Pump eeeet!

But conversely got crushed by WBA.  Took a major loss and moved on
Not the ticker I posted but I see you spamming in the daily. Am I really jumping in after yesterday massive candle? Can’t decide
This is assuming any of us can find a console to buy.
Isnt this a place where we gather?
Lol TSLA
Its because of SBE. If SBE go up then it will go up too its like NIO, LI and XPENG.
Yes, and even in it never makes money it will eventually be bought out by some Mega company at 10X, so you can't lose.
Can also reward them for a job well done with a firm but friendly open handed slap on their posterior.

I can speak on behalf of other TSLA bears (aka sober people) when saying that we are fully aware of the risk of shorting TSLA. Just this year's price action gets you prepared to handle the most obscure shenanigans Space Karen could come up with.
Every day I have massive gains I tell myself take a break the rest of the week and enjoy. Yet here I am like a kid on Christmas morning buying loads of shares at 7am
Yes, we really do
Anyone got AAXN positions? They do tasers, small-cap-ish, 15% past month.

Happy birthday, dude. If you're lying, you will die in your sleep tonight.
1400 shares since around 8
At least he started with play money
Yeah its interesting, TTD has a price/sales ratio of 53 which is extremely high, but if you even cut that by 80%(10) it's still almost double of MGNI (6). I think it has room to grow with a near term pull back possible after today pre market pump and most likely dump.
Netflix is removing The Office next month. Time to short?
Pic is undervalued in the stockmarket, can go easily to 20-25$. Sold my BLNK earnings for this.
It seems to have a slight dip every morning around open, im hoping that happens again and plan to buy more shares then, but what do I know we're all retards here
Oh shit, and what if a broken clock is "broken" because it only goes too fast or too slow, that means it's never right

Tasty trade bruh
Glad I didn't get paper hands like Op(just playing) its going back up :)
You don’t even know what PDT is?
We rallied back to 0%, and this has convinced this entire sub that this means we're about to have a green rager. Everyone is making their opening call-buy plans.

I was gonna buy calls at open but... I dunno. All this euphoria over 0% concerns me a bit. Starting to smell a bit like a potential trap.

Well, there appears to have been a 180 in futures while I was sleeping
This market gives me a headache. I thought I was stupid all night for selling my puts now everything is green.
I'm gonna cut my losses and sell my Tesla puts for calls.
PLTR you magnificent beast
Bears are in denial
Oh thx. The point about strike vs ticker is helpful.
Imagine thinking aliens aren’t real

That’s as retarded as not owning PLTR
There are no accidents, there are no coincidences. The trend is your friend until it’s not. Trade accordingly.

I feel the same. Gonna wait till next week. Hate holding over the weekend.
Told y’all to buy those GSX puts yesterday. 💰💵💸
Got a whole bunch of FDs yesterday
Green apple yeah um ?
My take is that autists and mms are starting to delta hedge this thing to the moon, and then the financials won’t matter. OI on November calls is spiking, and deep OTM calls in the future are starting to get picked up too.

If that snowball gets rolling, this thing moons fast.

IV is individually tracked on each strike for both types and also separately collectively presented as an average for the ticker. IV is just a calculation of price compared to the other attributes of the strike
I love the $0.05 buying power...  don't hold back!!!

Congrats btw.
me and they're getting crushed
Fucking penny. Stocks man hate to see it.
This is the most insightful point I’ve read anywhere.. this is true. Now you have me doubting how high PLTR can go, but will hold for the hype

I'm curious how the 500 fight will turn out today. WSB vs. MMs that sold a billion $ notional in 500Cs expiring today.
Roblox has been making robotic dildos. These dildos are too narrow, kind of short. Hard to reach pressure points and the vibration function very dull, so they don't make you feel anything.
Maybe, but I think this is a little different from a recreational drug becoming legal and a new revolutionary engine tech. Remember, new names do re-invent the wheel. Who would have thought 15 years ago that hardly no one would own a Blackberry or a Nokia.

The car established companies you mention might become the Nokia's of the car industry, while Tesla, Nio, Xpeng ect become the Apple and the Samsung.

I bet you horse dealers had the same scepticism about the motor wagon when the first saw it. Funny thing is the engine design is fundamentally the same then as it is now. But with the development of new EV, and it becoming more mainstream (and cheaper) in the next 10 years, I know where I would prefer my money invested.     

I'm not saying its not gonna crash, but I do have confidence of massive potential growth over the 10+ years.

Already made profits on its rally to $37 this year. Not my bag of bread anymore.
Maybe some other time... good luck though! I do think BABA is undervalued, especially now. But I’ve been burned by it not just recently but also right around their Q2 earnings (went back to $200 from $215, I think?). I think it’s just not the right choice for me 😆

It may have a quick pump and dump. With SPACs I would wait to see where it levels off at after ticker change.
honestly thats almost everyone watching crsr pltr and nio on the sidelines. just remember it could have gone either way
Fuck it you convinced me
I had $400c's (expiring today) purchased early September (Baba trading at $298 at the time) I cut my losses on this a while back, but holy shit, I did not expect it to go down 20% in those 2 months. Good thing NIO more than makes up for my losses
Nobody here is looking for +200% over 10 years. They either want to be +10,000% or -99% before December.
proposing upwk as the new meme, up 2.3% premarket, 15% this week and 90% this month
Bet you he has no problem buying a Playstation  5
Why am I not seeing anyone here talk about SPCE?  You guys must seriously hate money in WSB.
She hated the pretentious fuckwads on Wall Street so much that she quit, and spent the next few decades as the CFO or COO of different non-profits, NGOs, and government organizations. And then she retired.
LoL hahaha sure thats what will happen. Sorry for beeing rude but I can not help it hahah it means that CIIG merge corp accounts for only a certain percantage of the comapny. After they mere market cap will go to 7,1B if the price stays $17. U will still have 1000 if you bought in at 17

Marketwatch
because people have minds it becomes a reality you dummy fuck.
It is because it is on lots of peoples mind. They will sell on a round number like 20, creating a barrier.
I don't think the people buying $52k EVs are the kind with a gunrack mounted.

Probably more the type that wear skinny jeans and drink almond milk.  And also maybe people who tuck in their shirts and wear a belt.  Different groups.
And if anyone wants to buy your ARVL shares thats a really big IF imho🤓

Essentially, yes, but only if the stock price trades above $12 for all 20 days between Dec 1 and Dec 21, then they can start dumping. 

“As long as Nikola stock trades for 20 days above $12 after the 150 days, they can then start selling. So, effectively they have 170 days. Here is what that means. One hundred and fifty days after June 3 is Nov. 30. The 20-trading-day countdown starts on Dec. 1. So, by Dec. 21 the PIPE shareholders, who own 52.5 million shares, can start selling.”

PLTR will go to $20 and from there will skyrocket very fast to 22,23 because it broke the 20 barrier.

NIO does well on flat or red days. All the money is looking for somewhere to go...  Fridays are usually a crapshoot though. That 12% drop last friday still haunts me.
Any second now. Any second 😎
How could you say something so controversial yet so brave? Also fuck that shit let's 🚀  bby

Touché. Still the truth.
Pltr being pumped for market opening and then dumped, someone bought 41k shares pre market lol
FENG is trading like at 2.25 and just started offering dividends of 1.37

Am I high, or does that mean it can drop by half and I would still make money.?
I know it's a penny stock but it's part owned by the Chinese government, I doubt it's gonna to go tits up any time soon.
I've sunk in big chunks of money on leaps on some of the meme stocks over the last few weeks. Looking to protect myself against any rug pull in December, any suggestions beyond putting an equal amount into gold?
This market’s has brakes!
PLTR to dip at open?
[deleted]
Nah u rite it’s funny in a dark way

But who actually thought companies care about their employees
Nope. Waiting for a dip for the past 2 weeks on some tickers I'm following. 3-5% up everyday, but I know as soon as I buy calls it'll crater.
dumb move
But that's just it, you don't hold.

You also make a few different bets.

BABA fucked me, but only for a day. Missed the pop but also missed the pop.

Got in COTY calls. They were up 101 percent last night. Good premarket. Highly recommend

After doing some initial research, Arrival feels like a very sophisticated Kickstarter campaign. Right now, this Kickstarter campaign is fully funded thanks in part to a huge preorder from UPS. Not to mention, all the EV FOMO spilling out of Tesla and the Chinese EV market.

Can’t sleep thinking about this call I’m planning on buying at open and wether or not imma fuck myself or flex
That's how you know he's really a member. Doesn't have enough real money to stage a photo.

Retail really is systematically finding every $200m EV startup and boosting them to $500m within days. One after another, then they drop out of popularity and price then get relifted. Crazy. Crazy profitable too.

Real. KKR bought majority stake back in summer, did housekeeping and their corporate takeover magic, and company turned a profit again at ER last week. Was ~$10-12 pre-COVID. Not ready for that yet but was way undervalued based on return to profit and direction. Shouldn’t moon to last 7-7.50, but There’s technical gas left in tank to buy in and hold and grab 20% in the next month or so easy.

How do I start one of these companies that just says whatever the fuck they want and moves their own positions
Red futures literally hanging on by a thread..... Don’t do that. Don’t give me hope
Average up on a trend down. Won’t go up forever, so you’ll have an opportunity
Agree and have been saying this since January but have learned not to mess with stocks that have crazy momentum for no reason at all (NIO, NKLA, ZM).

If it does rocket like Tesla or Amazon, I'll wait until it shows actual potential rather than potential for potential just because it *could* be the "Amazon of Africa". So Tesla buy should have been in 2016 and Amazon in the early 2000s. Those that refer to jumia as the Amazon of Africa seem to think that a successful business is dependant on an idea alone rather than whatever Amazon, Walmart and Alibaba did to get to where they are.

It's a good YOLO though. I'd buy a small amount in the 15 to 17 range when it dips in the next few weeks.

Pajama traders are pussy asses who wont move this market.
Because everything below 30 is undervaluing this stock. There's a lockup period until March so basically, no sellers and institutionals only hold 15% which needs to go up to 40%.
Missed out ?? It’s under $20 and going to $100+, nobody missed nothin
The gated community uses Gotham. They already know if you have Palantir
Everyone's been hYpjng PLTR for awhile..
It was targeted at a higher 12mo price than nio
I hope
It goes up
There are alternatives depending on the market. In Morocco, Glovo is eating JMIA's lunch and will continue to do so. In Nigeria, it's Konga which is a local who knows the market better than Jumia. In general, I am personally a fan of these local start ups over cross-country platforms like Jumia (headquartered in Dubai, by the way)
If you wanna go from 1000+ profit all the way down to break even in a second

I bought some stock, as soon as I see it starting to drop I'm out. Just there for a quick cash grab.
In my experience the problem isn't usually the dose, but the duration of treatment despite side effects occuring.

Those that quit when the depressive side effects started would do just fine.

Those that continued for a year or longer despite the depressive side effects had a huge problem.


So in my experience it seems like if you stop once side effects occur, there's a very great chance of those not yet having become permanent.


Plus you also need to balance the potential depression and other negative symptoms of hairless in itself with the risk of the drug.


And after all, the largest portion don't experience the side effect at all.

The difference is that in Africa, they will have a local retailer for everything anybody could want unlike in the west where you'll need to order that replacement TV remote online, or that vaccum cleaner part etc. etc.

We have a dependence for e-commerce here because we've wipes out the brick and mortar niche stores. Africa does not have this yet and won't for another 10 years.

Secondly, the buying culture for over consumerism is totally different. They'll fix that bike until it's worn down to a paperclip before buying a replacement on impulse at 3am because it was 5% off.

Anyone that buys jumia now should expect to hold it for a loooong time.
Imagine in five years from now when there are thousands of us PLTR and TSLA billionaires and we are all living in a gated community

I digged into numbers and even though they had big dump this year but their cash reserve is more than enough to cover. It is only a matter of deciding if travel/airlines will resume as it was pre covid or not. Overall, i go with buy.
MODS
You are most likely right. One needs to only look at the one-year chart to be able to tell there is huge fomo atm. The dump will be immensive, but as someone mentioned the market is still pumping and the biggest profits are made just before the crash and everyone wants to get on the wagon while it's still going uphill.
PALANTARDS RISE UP!!! 20 EOD EASY
30th!
today is BABA comeback day
Also love the neon genesis avatar
next level autism
Fuck off Europoor, we only deal with Freedom Bucks here.

As for PLTR, I read somewhere that companies don't need to change the way they collect data, PLTR just comes in, use their voodoo magic, and allows the customer to see data from different programs interact with each other.  That's a big selling point, as companies can keep on trucking without changing the way they do things, whilst getting a better insight into their data.
I like turtles
SBE to $25!!
COVID is definitely irrelevant. People are itching to travel, that is one industry that will bounce back rapidly without a doubt and reach new highs in the near future. Regulatory challenges are not all that concerning for the long term. You have a company that was profitable before COVID with high growth in an industry that will bounce back fast.
Until 2035
INTERSTELLAR 2 PALANTIR SPECIAL JUST DROPPED🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I think it is because of Thanksgiving next week. Only 3.5 trading sessions that week

TSLA 500c back on the menu boys
Probably the day they show up on SP
Pass them on to your descendants.
Holy shit, PLTR no chill again...
I am all into gig economy but this one unlike fiverr/upwork is kinda not necessary. Fiverr/upwork capitalizes on freelance market which is massive & kinda necessary specifically after covid, not to mention fiverr/upwork were growing pre covid & covid only accelerated that. Maybe treat Airbnb like airlines until covid drama is over?
On a serious note this a great lesson in ignorance and learning, I’m new around here and had no idea it was ever that high. Probably gonna call it quits if it goes past 19 today.
We don’t need that negativity 😂
Could PLTR be the first million bagger?
It's like there is a whole world outside of Chinese EV memes
SOLO cars look perfect for individual commuters and for food delivery vehicles
what are some actually good calls to buy today?
Thanks man! Just shares as well, worst case scenario I’ll baghold for 5 years lol
Not trading always beats trading and losing
$50 today, $55 might be a stretch
It's an anagram for Trader.
Nah dude I got my girl a 1.05 and all her friends remark on how big it is - in reality it’s only a bit bigger than average, but it is noticeable.

Just got to make sure you get the right cut and it looks great
I sold on Monday lmao

why?
It's just coping for when their account gets blown up.

Europoors save us!
I didn't put in much at all, and I went shares instead of options, so my max return is basically nothing anyway but so is my max risk

Good luck
My only regret was that I didn’t buy more BABA.
Whole lotta FOMO...buy the top!
.
Another gift. Ty.
-100 billion in revenue and net income. How is that even possible?! Sounds like a prime candidate for a short squeeze if the price keeps rising. But these options are already at over +9% break even.  Where are people placing their strikes on this one?
I told you I was gay didn’t I?
I’m long JMIA for 600 shares at ~$12. As soon as I saw people referring to it as African Amazon, I bought because it does not matter what the business model is, the hype has transcended that.  I have a feeling this is the next 10 bagger.
Probably investing.com

Dear Sir Mr Jpow, 
        Plz with all sincerity,  let the money printer go burr! may all $BA 210c holders, that bought at the top, and are getting obliterated by iv be granted a bail out!!
My company has been trying to use Palantir products for last 4 yrs and till recently was not even able to figure out how it can be used. Ultimately now they have finalized a project for Risk reporting (side by side to Tableau and Cliq). Management thinks it will change everything but nothing on the ground feels that it will. I personally feel it is more hype and they have selling the product based on government projects.
PLTR looks hard and ready to moon!
A fucking ten bagger, good shit. See you on the PLTR rocket son.
😞 Tesla why did I doubt myself and sell early
Am I still banned?

Yes.   Especially when it's moving fast and takes a minute to submit and then you're 10% away from current price
Nice! Have a few of the same NIO calls, just not on the  level that you do. One day
I don't get why reddit loves to shit on boomers and then they turn around and applaud all the dumb shit like lockdowns, mandatory shutdowns and crazy ass stimulus packages like it's free money. I wonder how many redditors actually realize that the boomers are retired and therefore will contribute nothing to the economic recovery while they're basically forced to pay off trillions of dollars of debt just to save a few boomers
I need to be stimulated Mnuchin

That's heavy mate. Hope those shares bring you the prosperity your father would have wanted for you.

Make sure you put some aside for uncle sam, he wants his tendies too.

Regs is my concern. My local dictators killed the short term rental business with a quick zoning code change, and these assholes are bought and paid for by the hotel owners.

But yeah, I'll throw something at it IPO day.

shhh don't jinx it pls! I don't want this stock to be talked about here
honestly.. practically python code
I actually agree with this. Not to mention, African market-goers tend to prefer small-scale traders and open farmers markets for that feeling of social contact.

JMIA tendies will probably last short term and then go down as swiftly as they went up.

JMIA 12/18 15P because I'm a broke gambler
Ya no. Go learn or read a book or watch a YouTube video. Don't ask here... "Options will close automatically"  sure...
Like when AMC was on the brink. It was up 100% at one stage within a couple of days
Maybe he meant nkla and was just confused

I noticed 12/4 options have higher IV than 11/27 options for almost every stock. Is there an important event happening between those dates?
Hate being gay, some retard said Carnival is overvalued and I put a 12/4p17 and it’s getting pounded.
How dare they disturb my girl
I am selling 3c RIGL calls expiring friday because WSB was saying it was a "sure thing"

It came close to 3 bucks but never crossed.

Dunno how I feel my first inverse of WSB working out like this.

Thanks. You’re the only one who actually offered advice.
Same boat, you could roll out for bigger gain if it continues to climb, or just sell and lock in profits.

Oh interesting. Snowman land.
spy bid ask is still a touch below yesterday close as of now.
Didn't see any article. Just purchased a small amount of shares a few days ago and looking for peoples opinion on the stock. 

Have been looking at various automobile companies stocks recently. Aston Martin also extremely low price around 0.72 and were 10 times this time last year. What Aston Martin don't have compared to Rolls though is a branch in the aviation industry
FUV run is astounding... I hopped in at 12.. shit myself at 13 and got out with a few hundred dollars... Crazy how a couple thousand in this stock had my heart racing more than 50k in TSLA... 

&#x200B;

SNAP to moon today following Voisey acquisition... 

&#x200B;

And I have been saying this for days now... EV's to moon again. It's not a bubble until NKLA is back above 50! 

Disclaimer: I have and never will purchase calls in NKLA. I only purchase calls for actual companies that make products and sell said products. NKLA is literally the biggest pile of horse dung this EV market has ever produced. 

Nio, Li, X-Peng and of course Daddy Elon are the only EV's getting my calls. If FUV doesn't drop below 13 today then I will be throwing some money its way out of pure FOMO and due to insane momentum! SOLO may also be a small four figure shout...
Too bad my solo DD thread got deleted. 

But I'm up 500%
Ok gang, I have some 20C PLTR expiring 12/4. If they go ITM today should I roll them out for a later date or hold them through next week?
Any good European Stocks to watch!?!? Or sub reddits to follow? It’s to boring whating for market open!

Do you have a reference for still growing fast? Neutered in Japan, and facing regulatory challenges elsewhere. Not saying it doesn't have potential, but it's facing difficulties, and we don't know how covid will change the industry.
PALANTIR CALLS TODAY

I made 100% off a 3x leverage on its initial bounce back up. Hoping to repeat
The answer is always wooden leg
So what happened to Tik Tok?
Is this an EV company? If not, they should hit up NKLA on how to draw an EV vehicle and unveil it to the public.
TLDR it is long term hold and will probably have some pops along the way, riskier timing the pops, safer playing long
It is quite a well known story in Hong Kong. You can find the gangster profile in wikipedia.

And after losing that much in casinos, he asked Li Ka Shing for the advice on investment.

Bulls need to get on FSLY, OSTK and PTON. They are all sitting about 2% below some heavy resistance. If the resistance breaks there are large gaps that can be filled in.

Lol you just saw that article posted
thanks, refreshing to hear a contrary viewpoint
yeah
Yeh, I hold it as a medium/long term value play. Going through their portfolio nothing screamed short term pop potential and if anything I am planning to average down with the ongoing childhood immunisation drop. Biologics may emerge in future as a breadwinner portfolio for GSK via biosimilar and their migraine therapeutics.

We will see.
Nah
SPY calls at open, switch to puts quick if we start drilling
Going against momentum when volatility is falling is a risky game to play folks. Take any 'DD' no matter how convincing with a pinch of salt. And remember that the stock market acts as rationally as a coked up hooker when you run out of blow and tell her that you used the last of your money to buy said blow prior to getting her/him to blow on your peepee...
Oh shit! Have some ppl’s Cs finally printin?!
lotta bag holders, but when they restart the ANT ipo it'll boom
Eh, I don't know even know what most of the companies I trade even do. All about TA (not T&A), liquidity, and greeks (no, not greek).
Hard to say I'm holding a 360 call
so buy at 1.02, sell at 1.1

Got it.
Maybe yes
Saving this post for later
It went up 4% and ended up 3% in HK I think. I expect something similiar
I am going against the hype. They have not been profitable since inception 17 years ago. If they haven't figured it out by now, something has to change: new CEO, modify the business model... I don't think throwing more investor money will solve this.

ARKInvest twitter page no longer exists - wut

Is it time to buy BABA calls? What could let the stock soar?
PLTR surpassed 19$ boyyyy

Was this a few office lackeys with gallows humor betting a few dollars in jest while sitting at their cubes, or was this management's friday funday corona bets in the conference room? Big difference. People joke about dark shit in passing all the time, but that's a lot different from orchestration it in an official fashion.
I aint never seen a rich gay
That's what I'm saying. All summer long we got weekly apocalyptic bear DDs and kept pumping. Stopped in September and boom, massive drop. We need to roll out doom DDs every week as a sacrifice to the Bull gods to keep the party going.

Sorry for your loss. I recently lost my grandmother and was unable to even make trades for a couple of days. 😔

I hope you do. I’m looking forward to your ‘I knew I should’ve kept my PLTR calls’ comment in a few days
No dumb fuck
Wow I’m glad I bought more BLINK. The thing ranked right before close and shot right back up! Shorts ain’t shit!
Sounds amazing. Happy cake day, hope you’re happy.
Lmao. So salty. My bad you suck at trading. Also if that were the case he’d post up a screenshot so stfu. Let’s see your all time gains.
Oh look, SPY recovered! It’s almost like being gay in TRUMPS AMERICA is a bad financial decision!

In BABA and CRSR today throwing 10k more at BABA at open, my dick is torqued and ready to go
That album still isnt out yet crazy

Who’s going all in on the roblox IPO then 😎
Hope you’re right retard my 11/25 puts are getting anxious
Well guys I finally managed to blow the account up with puts, shouldve known better, I kill the market on my days off and can focus on the market, but if I try n trade at work I get autistic fomo into stupid shit, investing in rope godspeed my fellow retards!

Im a poor gay bear. I’m counting on you us folks. Dump this shit
Any news on PLTR Bois??  🚀🚀
LOL You right, shit I need some caffeine.

Long term 100$
Yeah but the new players start playing when they go from 4 years old to 5 years old
Been listening to this thread for over an hour already... Half the comments start with "when the market opens tomorrow" smh
I don’t see a strike and expiry
Name does not check out
Yes, I’m yoloing this for sure. Business model has crazy potential, disruptive as hell, giant revenue and still growing fast. Who cares about COVID? That shit was over months ago according to the market, we are future focused. This is probably the biggest yolo company of 2020.
Since Death Race 2000 was cancelled, next one isn't until 3000. Bullish.
Palantards\*
Now buy some normal and safe stocks with half of that so you don’t lose it all. Please
Some entity with fiery red eyes and a menacing voice spoke to me in my dreams tonight and told me to just hold PLTR. Seemed like a chill dude, hope I'll meet him sometime again for a beer or something.
though I do advise caution with stocks of an oriental persuasion
Bullish this easy 40$
How can you price in a 9/11 event, what the fuck

AYRO baby. Low market cap with a ton of room to grow. It's seen a pickup in volume this week, but it's only beginning.
Stonk go up ????
I bought some shares the other day too
wait til the age vaccine comes out next week to make you immortal. Now all of a sudden your time horizon goes out to infinity, you got some catch up investments to make!! Market going to moon.

short answer is that making silicon is hard.
Eh doesn't really look like it but I'll probably buy some when it IPO's. I like their service and their numbers look decent. But obviously its not Stripe/SpaceX. I think the AirBNB industry is more similar to Upwork/Fiverr rather than Uber.
I know its stupid but confession. 

Part of the reason I bought baba is that in my language it means father and I lost my father recently.
I would recommend he invests in a plastic surgery.

Holding SPY 357. Sell at open or will it go higher in the day we think?
Will JKS go up again soon? I am dissapointed so far
This is not DD.
There are other trees out there. Yes, it may be undervalued and have some gains back in the future but right now they are dominated by AMD chips across the board. 

With the new AMD chips Intel even lost their small dominance in single core performance (which anyway didnt make much sense because you really could see the differences only if you were buying the best CPU with the best graphics card to play on a 1080p monitor...)

And now Apple dumped them. 

You’re so much better off putting your money elsewhere even if Intel proves in a few years to have been undervalued, which really is going to be just a lottery in believing INTC will crawl back up. 

Better invest in BABA if you want something highly undervalued... It has the risk of China being China but it is insanely undervalued at the moment, while being decisively the strongest force in the largest market. Not a beat-up dog that you hope is gonna get up.
Yeah lets buy when its up 65% in a week
Let's hope you don't regret for life getting rid of it

Sure if you're planning to hold very long term
People say everything is priced in, even up to 50 years in the future...
I’m thinking I need out of these PLTR $22c’s ASAP
Yeah, what's more annoying is the extra 0.3 or so service fee depending from your broker + the change rate if you buy on US markets, tends to add up quickly if you trade a lot, but it obviously could be worse.
QFIN is retardedly undervalued. I bought a shit ton last week, too bad it’s not really a popular stock. I still think it will moon, but this is one you buy leaps on (too bad they don’t exist) or hold for 2 years. It will probably take a long time for the price to correct on this one.

Sir this here is a casino
what do you mean? tell me more
Da
It's more nuanced than that. This comes back to when AMD decided to go "fabless" by splitting off it's fabs into a different company, Global Foundry (which has essentially failed).

When AMD stopped using GF fabs and started using TSMC more after the ATI acquisition that is when the game really fucking changed. Because TSMC has a) such fucking huge fabs and b) are -only- building fabs they are able to invest fucking insane amounts of money into fab tech. They effectively scaled their fab business to multiples of what INTC or AMD ever had internally.

The inevitable result of that is they have for the last decade nearly been at the forefront of new process nodes and generally had much better yield and supply than other foundries.

INTC on the other hand has trucked on with it's own fabs which are smaller, with less money to invest into fab tech and has generally fallen badly behind through mismanagement of their technical team. Bean counters especially really fucked them in the ass here.

Essentially INTC has fallen behind at the only thing that used to give them a key advantage, fab tech. Now APPL and AMD just partner with TSMC and ship 5nm and 7nm process while INTC struggles with 10nm and ships most of it's products on it's super fucking old 14nm process.

The reason why Xi boi blocked the ant IPO is it is going to unravel Gyna’s fraudulent financial system
 shitcoin is a currency, ppl need to get over it. i think the strength of shitcoin is it cant be printed to cover debt
No, not when it completes its IPO. Companies accounts are a mess and they are basically going public because they cannot cover their current liabilities, exacerbated by the pandemic, as a private company. Additionally, the management took a significant amount of compensation while this was the case which does not look too good.
thats nothing but a rounding error compared to what americans have to pay, i think here in switzerland it‘s also like 0.15% or sth but only if you use a swiss broker
Exactly! If I’m going to burn my money, I like to see it happen when looking at my RH account.

Are we pancake titties today?
I think their fabs are too far behind to ever catch up to TSMC and Samsung.

I think they'll slowly continue to bleed market share. Maybe they'll make a massive turn around, but calling it seriously undervalued isn't right. There's more competitors in the space now, and the only criteria they're better in now than then is reputation, and they're losing that fast. 

Wouldn't touch it if it was me. Stuff like Qualcomm or Broadcom is more interesting to me.
What a gay post. “I know it’s going to crash, but also it might not”
I would've thought that every year for the last 5+ years yet AMD just eats their lunch. 


Eventually they will innovate something worthwhile but right now the cost/benefit is not in their favor for PCs.

See the other big thread in this daily. TLDR I wouldn't buy. AMD is going to repeatedly eat their fucking lunch for the next few years and INTC may never recover.
Thanks. My inner accountant was thinking operation expense
Maybe going cash for a bit

In the history of spy, every head and shoulders formation played out perfectly in the past, crashing weeks within hitting the resistance line 3 times. 

This whole week has been flirting with the resistance line for the 3rd time and can’t seem to get past it. If it breaks out it will be impressive
Yeah, on red
Sums it up nicely.

There are 157 million Americans in the US workforce

43 out of every 100 have filed for unemployment at some point this year
Id argue  **Σ** perks cost <<  **Σ** HR cost due to employee turnover without perks
Mostly NIO stocks as that seems volatile enough, mostly BABA calls 260-275C a month or so out, half calls half stocks PTON

Also premiums are wild on NIO and pretty chill on baba
I'm thinking about buying some INTC today. That company has got to be seriously undervalued right now. P/E is like 8. They've had a hard few years, but I think they're gonna bounce back. What do you guys think?
Thank you and fuck off.
Yeah if that is true and he isn't leaving for health reasons/similar they are just completely fucked. Keller was literally their last remaining chance at attracting the sort of team that can compete with where AMD is now.

the ones you mentioned + BLNK (I think thats an EV, idk im retarded). Buying FUV 1/15/21 calls tomorrow, maybe some more AYRO
I actually like soros i like that he wanted to be free and rich but that didn’t make him happy everyone has their own conspiracy theory about how he is evil or whatever but he is actually just a good investor after a point probably when money became too abstract for him because he practically has infinite amount of it, the guy tried to change the world obviously he didn’t achieve as much as he dreamed but in his own way he tried to change things for the better that is better in his own opinion ofc. I get a sad genius who wants to leave a legacy vibes from him and really like his accent
Damn been eyeing BLNK for a while now and just saw it went up like crazy
I would say that you're starting him off wrong because you don't have Robinhood open on his phone, but then again...

Going off hacker news - it seems Jim Keller left Intel because they would not provide him the resources to build a good team. (Intel is famously proud to pay crap median wages and is overly political inside)


Note: I used to hold calls and the same view as you before getting out. I don't see them recovering unless they start paying stellar wages and attracting top talent again.

Did he say what he's gonna do next when he's buying??

Why would he say this?? Let's think
No lunch only beatings!!
All in or nothing.
Interesting idea.. I think people might sell more often. It would probably be more volatile than it already is maybe.
Yea and you prob still read the newspaper and drink black coffee ☕️
MSFT has been pushing for ARM on windows but slow adoption but as usual once Apple does everyone will know copy it and start moving towards it. Once Microsoft improves x86 emulation and drops some legacy 32 bit support it will make it easier for ARM cpu to run in windows. 

When that happens only place for Intel will be on servers and gaming machines where it will face tough battle against AMD superior processors

I don't have any positions in Palantir. I just like to read financials and IPO documents, and call out the media (if they twist something around) or the company. In this case, the company is very open about their business model and I don't think it is scaleable.

Where I would complain about the company is the "free perks":
https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-what-its-like-to-work-at-2016-7

Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Free dry cleaning.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Palantir-Technologies-Free-Lunch-or-Snacks-US-BNFT36_E236375_N1.htm

And apparently, you can bring your family to eat free too.

A business has an obligation to its investors. This is reckless spending, especially for a business that is not profitable. This is how they were spending the money of their early investors.

GME won’t become the most valuable company on earth like Volkswagen did for a short while but that’s not how shorting the shares work. 

If Cohen forces a vote and shares are called back then it creates a situation where the shorts have to find the shares the return but people holding the shares don’t really have an incentive to sell (why would they, if there’s more money to be made?).
Yep, but WSB turds think getting 10000% returns is how you win. Take your profits and adjust. I personally think today will be mostly red with the bad news from the fed yesterday and no stim talks.

Sounds crazy
Wouldn’t it make sense that after the gains recently they sell, take profit and rebalance their positions? In order to not be heavily influenced by a few stocks?

Would be interesting to see how their etf was build up a few months back in perspective to just before the selling and after the selling.
Monthly options expiry. Volume goes very high in the last hour as people close out their positions. Sometimes funky stuff happens (I remember AAPL being pinned just under $500 pre-split on 8/21  
  
We have been on an absolute tear in the last 3 weeks. Very little to no pullbacks. Not sure what tomorrow holds.
Damn even in PM PLTR stays bouncing off of $19 lmao
INTC has no good catalysts upcoming... every release they can make for the next 1-2 years is going to be overshadowed by AMD.

INTC is going to be in the dumps for a long time but I do think it's worth keeping an eye on in case it does get too cheap.

Legendary chip designers generally hop around between the companies and though it looks like Jim Keller is out of the game now he was most recently at Intel.

The significance of this can't be understated.
He built the K8 Althon architecture back when AMD dumpstered on Intel all those years ago, then he led the team that built Apple's ARM based silicon because Intel wouldn't provide them with the chips they wanted (this architecture probably still lives on in the recently releasted M1).

After leaving Apple he built Zen for AMD, the very architecture that is destroying Intel right now. Then he went and did the Tesla stuff before joining Intel.

He was there for 2 years, likely long enough to establish a team and set in motion the next generation architecture. Important factor to keep in mind here is the time lag between laying this stuff down and chips actually getting fabbed. In the case of Zen, Keller left all the way back in 2015 but AMD has only seen the benefits of his work in the last few years.

TLDR: Intel getting fucked atm but smart chip guy make AMD stonks go up also worked at Intel recently, Intel stonks eventually go up.
You made a great buy bro. Any option that returns 20% is a win, could’ve easily dipped back down. Good shit
that shit was kinda fuckin weird though
I might buy tonight
NIO is building a real brand and has a management team with a far greater vision in my opinion, especially the CEO. Xpeng has arguably greater short term opps but long term, NIO with the vision, the brand I think will be more successful and I'll hold shares in both, not going for a short horizon for both of these firms especially since China wants 100% EV by 2030.
Im from Spain, I live in the future aswell
They may run out of time future is ARM SOCs see Apple M1.
SOLO. It won’t slow down.

Would it make you feel better if I told you the employees were placing bets as well?
automods can suck it .... for the fucking 5th time lancadia is not a penny stock and has a market cap above 500m … stop being a fucking dick and let me post the ticker !!!
Just got off the phone with the CEO of CRSR. He said expect $50 by EOD
The ones I listed are among the most obscure and low cap money sinks in the whole of s&p 500, that's the point of this post. I think a move on a combination of the tickers above is a pretty good strategy, especially considering the wsb intelligentia has been fixated on chinese EV p&d for the past few months...
yea i did, fucking grim, and like a true autist i kept telling myself it would go back up. 

Ever since i've set tight stop losses and adhered to them, been a learning experience if nothing else.

Their home countries must really suck dick if they're willing to move here so they can work at a chicken plant. Maybe we should make it more difficult for them to be employed so they won't have to risk having a shitty job.
And that isn't any reasons to choose XPEV. 
Its all about which 1 will make me more money.
That's why I just bought Intel shares while they were low. They got some real good tech coming out in the next 2 years so I'll just hold
Yes I agree that the main catalyst for the squeeze would be RC making moves. Only slight worry I have is if there isn’t a move by then and reporting isn’t as good as expected causing a drop in share price putting the shorts in an easier position to close in meantime
[deleted]
Bulls you gotta stop insta-downvoting all the bearish posts. You're gonna anger the bear god.

My guess is that they postpone it til after the winter holidays.
NTR $50 EOY calls. They're not expensive either.
Lpl, bet that's what people said when it went from 5 to 10.
Contrary to all the doom and gloom in media, economy is holding up quite well heading into holiday season. Yes unemployment rate is high and there is stimulus but both so far has not dampened consumer spending.
What does opex mean in this reference? Monthly rollover or quarterly weirdness? I'll research myself if you have something to point me to.
Wait one week
This is the way
Its gross margin is pretty healthy, has over a billion cash and the EBIT almost equals the R&D expense (wouldnt be surprised if they paid $750 tax)

Telos might be interesting. Maybe pick up 50 shares (boomer I know)
Why is Intel so far behind?

I've been thinking about investing, but their stock has just not been performing. I like their Core i7:s, been using their processors all my life actually, since the first Pentium came out. Thought they would be a powerhouse in the stock market.
I can back this up, I have an OnePlus after being a long term Sony "fan" and is lightyears away performance wise, price, camera, battery, everything. Huge screen, increased light, roaming Internet on, I go out, stay all day and when I come back, my battery is still 40%, it amazes me every time.

Yay
My portfolio is $200k and I have $1000 to spend. I already have TSLA, PLTR and NIO. What else is worth investing for a thousand dollars into?
It’s so funny watching all the calls. This market is going down in the next two weeks. Rona baby
The EV bubble had reached insane proportions months ago. Tesla alone controlling 100% of all vehicle manufacture and 40% of all energy storage dollars in the *world* in 2035 almost justifies it. Almost. They'd probably need a little more than that, and that was for their valuation pre-split.
Intel is literally years behind in their chip development compared to the competition which they admitted hence that massive fall. No empathy for anyone who thought that was a good play that would pay off within 2 years

I’m just trying to understand and a bit confused. If they’re getting rid of all gas vehicle production by 2035, and in 2035 half of all vehicles produced will have to be electric...then what will the other half be if it’s not gas?
Fuck soros all my homies hate soros
Thanks!
I am mostly in leaps but I have a bad feeling about today (Opex). I feel MMs will fuck everyone over as we haven't really had a good red day since Oct 28 (the nov 9 vaccine pump and dump doesnt count)  
  
With that outta the way, BABA to the moon and stars!
Not yet, you are right.
I will have a look, thanks!
I don’t think that was the general consensus
You shouldve just bought shares, son.
I mean I’m pretty sure Michael Jackson didn’t drop a baby off a balcony so this guy is an idiot
You're right, but I meant more the IPO run up levels (i.e. $40+).

Profitability is definitely not the name of the game, but that actually only furthers my point. These guys took a cut on orders and GMV over the last year just to try to become slightly more profitable. They are not playing the growth game anymore because they know they lost that chance. Now they're just trying to consolidate, turn a meager profit, and wait for the African market to be ready for them (I think they're 5-10 years too early)
Only question is how much are you down?
if u got a jungle, i would add a little sprinkler motion to cover all areas
What are other retards thoughts on BYDDF?
I had similar thoughts on the overall EV hype, there was this company CBAT and few more like this. This company’s description in RH says its a cannabis company but they’ve now somehow making EV work trucks 🤷🏻‍♂️ so yea I’m with you this EV craze is like the Long Island Tea company trade during the shit coin pump in 2017. The company’s shares pumped 2000/3000% many bag holders. Just be careful out there.
They got that retard EV strength like all the EV stocks right now

I bought at $11 Monday only holding because my pullout game weak.

I figure it's a similar concept to the way Tesla investors early on invested in Musk, more than the company itself. PLTR investors are investing in Thiel.

Falling where?

Interesting tip - when are their earnings?
It's at IPO levels. That means they probably have some cash.

Not so sure about shorting a company at recent IPO levels. I'm sure they won't be profitable anytime soon but that's not the game these days apparently. 

Doesn't seem like a sure bet.
Its because one you assholes put a massive sell order right at 19. Doesn’t have the volume to break it during PM.

Good question. You can buy and/or sell shares without actually owning them. Look up Contracts For Difference. I can sell shares of a company without ever owning them. In this case, I would make money as the price went down, rather than up. Kind of like buying puts on a stock.

I’m pretty bullish but I doubt it think we open in between $357.5-$358.5 but I think $361 is real possibility EOD
No idea what to expect for earnings. It looks to be having a downward trend (assuming due to lockdowns etc). How come you think numbers will be good? I would think Q4 numbers would be good due to new games releasing and new consoles... but q3 not sure
Bulls: \*gaps up\*
I mean it was probably just some MM covering their calls in a huge buy or some shit. There's really no way to know, but very few actual traders are trading at 4:30am, so sentiment usually isn't at play. It's almost always MMs covering or offloading at this hour.

If it holds up into 9am, I'll go bullish.

Agreed, they made a loss the year before (not great for an old company) and growing at circa 15% v Palantir >50% (in eight years revenue:value will be favouring Palantir), using issuance proceeds for employee compensation and paying down debt points to slow cash cow not star. For short term hype sure worth a punt maybe boomers will get on board given its long history and inclusion of vowels in its name

Just one of many examples I’ve seen. Try and get calls early because we retest ATH by next week. Then switching back to puts is at least a more reasonable move.
how about selling tsla theta ie covered calls

I think this current price won’t last and I’m avoiding.
33 dollars is more than reasonable. If Tesla stays on its current pattern I'll hit that by Wednesday or Thursday. Plus the short squeeze is ramping back into high gear.
Nice round numbers have stupid resistance, better aim lower like 380 or 385.

According to his screenshots, he has 10000 shares and 5000 Calls (1000 10c, 15c, 17c, 20c and 12c respectively). If - hypothetically - all of the latter were exercised he would have 500000 shares + plus the 10000 he already owns.   


Half a million shares might sound like much but its less than a \~1% ownership - by comparison, RC owns 9.98% (\~6.5 mil shares) as of the most recent filing.
Big tech will be fine which represents most of QQQ, yes ZM and other WFH stocks with super high valuation will get crushed a little bit but once wallstreet realizes WFH and digitization trend is only going to accelerate even post covid those stocks will rebound.
GME shortsqueeze between Q3 and Q4? Q3 numbers will be good but not stellar, RC might make a move before Q4...
Yeah I was really hoping it would spike back to 3500 for some quick gains

I think so. We should see 600-650 by dec 21
Why didn't I buy BABA calls
And if that does happen, BNTX and MRNA will be leading the way, with CVAC and TBIO in the mix as well.
Well put.
Will we see TSLA 600 by xmas?
GME is more brutal though. Look what % is short there. WIDE over 100%. And also over 100% of normal float held by institutions. It could be brutal.

There is no top if it keeps going up
Yes so it will come down to what happens with covid, economy and Biden’s policies and not artificial pumping.

 It could rally due to post covid euphoria or crash due to spiraling debt and slow covid vaccine rollout and possible new strain crushes the market. We just don’t know
Never actually did. Just asking a question.
Yeah it’s going crazy here. I have several good friends who have it right now. I’m all good so far though, thanks.

We may find out in a couple of years that several kinds of cancer are just not issues anymore because of the urgency that got us these mRNA vaccines in less than a year.

The dream is basically that they’ll be able to take a sample of a tumor and custom-make a vaccine for it that teaches your body how to destroy it.

I think of it as a mirror of the Human Genome Project. Mapping the first human genome took 14 years and cost $5 billion. Now companies can turn it around in a few days for like $100 and turn a profit.

The first mRNA vaccines cost at least tens of millions and took a year or so. How far are we from custom cancer vaccines that take three days and cost $100?

Not being a dick but actually offering something useful instead of a snarky sarcastic comment: go watch a YouTube on options. Plenty of options “basics” that will explain the fundamentals.

I typed kkk on google and the first suggestion was kkk roblox, I'm not even kidding.
They haven't been profitable since their inception 17 years ago. Their business model currently does not scale. Lots of work upfront for relatively low amount for customer acquisition. Their model is that their client signs up for their service. Palantir integrates their platform into the organization's systems. Customer request additional data be integrated. Eventually, Palantir is so integrated that it would be too expensive for the customer to back out and use something else, so they just pay.

Think of an organization that uses Windows operating systems. They don't even think about switching to another operating system and just pay Microsoft for the next upgrade.

PLTR?
hardships aside this is a great time for science, tech, and society. We learned so much during this crisis.

Going to buy more 2/19/21 BABA 300c... take me to the promised land of endless rice fields, China 🇨🇳!
Holy shit bears are dumb
Any other tips you can give me to not make profits?
You go now.

I want a real vaccine and ZM at $20
VTRS
Yes 600% gains this year were totally normal and to be expected. Anything past this point is when it gets stupid
Trouble is noone in Europe will touch China EV , probably not so many in America either.

Is still taking this in account?
There's so many companies that don't deserve their 100b+ market cap (zm comes to mind) - PLTR isn't one of em. They're gonna be a juggernaut. I'm also up 40% on PLTR shares so I'm basically okay with them dipping, staying for the long haul so i can get them capital gains tax breaks when i cash it all out without worrying about day trading it.
Buy puts. I dare you

How did you make money with negative balance?
You’re living in the past
Yes, we do
It would be fun if Trump refused to leave and the army refused to remove him and SPX dumped 1000 points in 5 trading days
You’re not understanding what Palantir actually does...
I have the yahoo finance app downloaded for watching stocks
I have 20c 01/21 planning currently at 3. Planning to set limit sell at 4 hoping it fills by next week or so. What say?
Homestarrunner.com
China is getting rid of all gas vehicle production by 2035 and by 2035 at least half of vehicles produced will have to be electric. This is why everyone is so bullish on Chinese EV, they are going to grow rapidly in the coming years and will probably expand into other countries markets.
NIO back at 48.45 pre market
Huh
🚀
$TSLA already $2500 pre split and you retards think it's going higher lmao
whats your preferred website for premarket?
people act like the big 5 tech doesnt exist when they have spying capabilities way beyond what palantir can do. big tech has been offered money by government since forever but they turn it down because it would become a PR nightmare for them.
BNTX is the much better play. 1/10 the size of PFE but they own half the vaccine gross profit. I bought in right before the initial announcement and made some good money.
De Beers literally control the supply and have millions of diamonds stockpiled, and they reduce the supply when they want the price of diamonds to increase to create artificial scarcity.

The market isn’t dictating the value, one family is.
It’s down PM lmao
SPCE IS STARING AT YOU
That is factually incorrect. Futures dumped when trump was ahead. You’re just spouting bullshit now goodbye.

SPCE is already mooning in the pre market.
So true. Ride the train before it crashes

December lock up period ends
Damn perfect description 💯
That’s a good point. Stole this from a website 

“Many market watchers expect a defense spending cut under Biden. Palantir counts the U.S. Defense Department among its clients and its software costs less than that of many traditional defense contractors, making Biden's election a potential tailwind.”
Literally nothing
The kid’s wife’s boyfriend. Geeez
Markets rallied overnight when Trump jumped ahead in polls
It’s safe as long as the government supports its. The government can find any national security reason to drop it, which would send the stock down 80%. Institutions will drop PLTR if gov does as well. Worse case scenario
every meme stock is red premarket, lmao
Right. On a macro economic level my ass dude. So an idiot who didn’t think it through and got a giant loan for a useless degree and now can’t find meaningful employment to pay off said degree will absolutely not make another financial blunder if his/hers loans are just completely written off? They won’t buy a house they can’t afford or finance a brand new car way out of price range in terms of monthly payments, rack up credit card debt buying material shit they don’t need etc? As soon as the loans are forgiven they’ll rush to buy something else fucking dumb on credit just to be trapped In a perpetual cycle of minimum payments and less access to credit again! Get real dude.
Guys, I don't want to jinx it, but I think BABA is going to the moon from here

We don’t do average in here though
I want a total economic ROPE and a constitutional crisis
TSLA!
They have never been profitable. They don’t have a lot of customers and the majority of their revenue comes from only like their top 20 customers ,28% coming from their top 3. Remember what happened to fsly after they disclosed Tiktok made up 12% of their revenue one quarter. I’m bullish but I think that’s the bear case.
And that’s why market rallied insanely when Biden was projected to win. You really have no idea what you’re saying and just parrot what other conservatives say. 🤦 learn to think on your own and actually do some research before opening that dog asshole you call a mouth
Csp 17 or 18 and hope to get assigned. Bottom 16?
Yep. Plus J&J is starting a 2-dose trial for their vaccine in case the 1-dose isn’t effective enough. If that happens it takes away a potential advantage J&J has been expected to have.

BNTX three weeks ago was my first big play. Made me a bunch of money; I sold half of what I had at the peak and rode all the way back down with the other half, then bought a bit more at the bottom.

I honestly think it’s way undervalued in the long run. MRNA technology is going to change medicine forever - especially for cancer, which is way bigger money than vaccines.
How can this be all green, when the stock is only valued at 12 USD?
Up 100% in the last month

Buying a million shares when market opens.
RIP my FCEL calls
Trump pump inflates markets 10% from where they should be, no Mnuchin with Biden to save bulls
They're solid but I don't have any money on them. Their interviews are notoriously difficult for some reason. FAANG is even easier. Also involved with some shady shit in the past. Here's an excerpt from 2018:

"Palantir's involvement reveals a tangled web of financial and political connections that suggest Palantir may have been part of a larger political machine used to elect Donald Trump — Peter Thiel, who sits on the board of Facebook and has vocally supported Trump, is reportedly close to the Mercer family of Republican mega-donors, who also happened to co-found Cambridge Analytica with eventual Trump campaign and administration honcho Steve Bannon."
Go with AZN
Let’s make that money
And Tesla is green PM.
I have lost on tesla before huge. I bailed never went back. Im thinking of just buying and selling covered calls. The bottom is now $463. Tesla will follow market from here out.
I think they're a 500b-1T company so my hype is through the roof but $100 share would be like 160-165b market cap.
What happened?

Yeah I think if it ever goes down its going to crash hard, otherwise you have news like soros which barely puts a dent in it. seems pretty safe overall for the moment and hey if they're going to spy on me at least lemme make some money off of it
Puts on JWN

I wish I was able to make half of what you make man, you did good. Major props my guy. Good Luck on the next one
hopefully a big one so i can buy more shares
Could have yoloed that in NIO
Hmm Moderna and Pfizer are up. Vaccine pump type of day.
What if soros was the autist , he just has late stage dementia and forgot . So he fired a random , but the random now wears a different shirt and uses a new name and Soros has since promoted him .

I'm not sure how best to paint the picture, but I've been to a shitload of engineering firms in the UK and abroad, lockheed martin, GKN, Rolls Royce, JLR, Airbus, Redbull, BMW Mini all the big ones. The only company to top this setup was Mclaren.

I believe the owner or co-owner is Ex-Formula 1 so when you enter the factory you're met with a Formula 1 car sat opposite a sofa, basket ball hoop, beanbags and pool table. Behind that a $500k German machine tool. Beyond that you have all of the EVs in various stages of build. While I was there they had a vehicle mocked up for UPS and Royal Mail in what I assume is a sales pitch.

Man i was expecting red too, but if we we're going to dump, would have happened already, so far seems like consolidation before the next leg up. Nasdaq broke downtrend (from oct/sep peaks) so its set to go higher as dow/iwm take a break.. DIX also really high showing insider buying. We will turn hard at some point, but i think either around 381 or 420 (elliot wave extensions)

Probably not for a few weeks or a crash. There is some safety to be had with a company developing intelligence software for the Army. At best, the price has/is/will always be manipulated. Short squeeze happening and institutional buying.. But I wouldn't count on a hard dip next week. Who knows though. The possibilities are endless in 2020.

Between modern and Pfizer — obv Moderna. The market cap has a huge difference so the movement at least 2x even if it is half winning to Pfizer. I think it’s worth putting long options depending on the premiums.

Always nice to hear another perspective. You gotta agree though that the way they’re going about it is pretty bad. There are much more civil and tactful ways of challenging the results than the what they’re doing now.
Sounds legit. The question is. Do women have more money to spend now that they work for themselves or did they have more money to spend before?
If you also have $15,000 elsewhere withdraw it as cash, count it and put it back. It may make it feel a lot more real for a while
Por que no los dos? Also selling puts. More premiums normally.

If I see $30 a share by next year it'd be a different story but memes like PLTR aren't really known for eating shit back to IPO levels without some serious Luckin Coffee type BS going on.

People saw the same shit with Facebook and Amazon. They just kept running while not turning a profit and having a super high PE. Obviously Tesla’s is a little bit higher than Amazon’s was back in the day but people don’t want to miss out on this one. In order for a stock to go up 2000% like Amazon and Apple, it’s gotta go up 800% to start. FOMO isn’t such a bad thing share wise. You might get fucked in the beginning but end game you’re cooling.

I understand what you’re saying now about the transactions and market itself being zero sum (or negative sum after fees and the like). I was conflating the value creation of people in the economy with the stock market itself which is just a conduit for people to trade shares in value generating (one hopes) companies.

If this is sarcastic then haha. 
If it isn't, then from what I know, a big variable in how much your stock is worth is determined by the implied volatility, or it's ability to change rapidly in either direction. Right before something like a quarterly earnings report, IV is at it's highest. So even if the stock isn't performing well, you won't lose too much because bulls or bears still value your option. But what happens is, as soon as the report is over, the IV immediately drops, making your shares near worthless, assuming you bought while IV was high.

it's an important distinction to make that PLTR themselves do not harvest or keep data. They work with whatever their clients provide them with and do things with that.

What do you say about stocks that quite clearly have not been negatively affected by Covid-19, but in fact have thrived? On an individual stock basis there are plenty that look set to continue doing well, regardless of vaccine progress.

Irrational exuberance, where investors feel invincible. This time it was the Fed that made us feel invincible.
I don't think this crashes as you may believe.  TSLA going to carry NQ single handedly through its SP inclusion however they decide to do it through Dec, it will hover around $500-600 wouldnt be surprised if it hits 1k again with the sheer #s of fanbois, while NQ does its +/-100.  In between intermittent tug of war with stay at home vs. not stocks, tech v. non-tech dow hovering near ath, and intermittent vaccine  alongside the stimmi carrot, likely will see spy fluctuate 350-360 rangebound. Through holidays retail numbers will be slightly up "better then expected" will be BF sales kicking off shopping season through holidays as you say the FED kool-aid poured into the sheeple.  Historically, the holiday effect will be + carrying us into Biden election.  The one monkey wrench in this bull case is the election if Trump pulls something out his arse we may get your scenario, but it will still be quite muted because there is a vaccine headed our way at the end of the not so long tunnel.  All is well in the neighborhood my friend, but very much appreciate your effort and have it in mind.

Yep. What about us who have been making payments on time for over 10 years? Refinanced multiple times to get the interest rate below 2.5% and upping the monthly payments every time a new higher paying job/promotion or a bonus came in or i killed off another debt from elsewhere? Not buying overpriced supreme and yeezy bullshit and a new iPhone every time one comes out? Multiple Christmas holidays with just a pair of new jeans as a present or maybe a nice work shirt that’s under $50-40? It’s called financial responsibility and discipline. If you’re going to forgive student loan debt I want at least a 50k check mailed to me for having suffered thru paying mine on time. I started in 2009 with a worthless fucking finance degree. My first job paid under 35k salary and I fought my way thru all of it to now be able to make 120. So no. I’m also out on this loan forgiveness shit too.
Oh so my apple puts are fucked fucked
I agree with him. Been chillin on it since it was $3 and I bailed hard today. As soon as it hit 6, it pretty much immediately sold down to 5. I think the early buying was probably the last wave of FOMOers trying to get in.

There are a lot of people who have suffered FCEL for a long time and are in at $2 and below, not to mention the buyers who scooped it up at the beginning of this run. Wouldn't be surprised if it sells off really hard. Then again, in this market it could end up going to 10 lmao.

This kid is going places. And so far it looks like hes going for a nap.
Forgive me if I’m missing something, but from Wikipedia: 
“In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others as much as it increases the amount available for that taker, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility).”

In this case the market is not a zero sum game because there is a gain in utility (in this case, wealth) across the participants in aggregate. The stock market is not a fixed-size cake but a growing cake. You can cut a slice, watch it grow, sell it to someone else for a profit, and they can watch it continue to grow. 

I’ve never heard the term zero sum or negative sum used in the way you describe. Not to say you’re wrong, but I wonder if it’s a contextual definition.

I would like to add that a lot of the performance results we are seeing with the M1 chips is, to a great extent, due to the lithographic process node used to make the CPU, TSMC 5nm. Not to demerit Apple from the fantastic engineering job they have made. The M1 by all means is a fantastic CPU.  


I think Apple's advantage will come from the vertical integration they are achieving. Developing for the Mac product line will be basically the same as developing for the iPhone and iPad. Users will have seamless integration between all their idevices and Apple watch. That is going to make for a great experience. How that translates to Apple's bottom line we will see.   


In terms of their computing power advantage I think it's too early to give Apple the crown. Once we start seeing x86 in chips manufactured in the 5nm (or Intel's equivalent) process node, we will get better performance comparisons. I do believe x86 will slowly fade away as it's performance advantages have diminished with each generation.  


Lastly all of this comes in the context of how software products and services are being developed. A lot of them have their information crunching might in server farms far away. For a lot of things we really do not need super powerful computers. A device with good battery life, light, quiet, and ergonomic is far preferable than heavy pizza box that is constantly overheating.

Man this TESLA inclusion is why you hold VTI in your "little bitch retirement" portfolio instead of VOO.
Until you have to make phone calls. 😁😁😁
Yolo tsla call
Ideas for 2021 calls (March or later):

MRNA 120c

BNTX 120c

TSLA 550c

JWN 25c

JETS 25c

AMD 100c

COTY 10c

TTCF 25c

NCLH 25c

DKNG 75c

CNK 20c

BABA 300c

Buy one of each of these and check back in in a few months and I promise you will have tendies. At least 3/4 of these will print guaranteed or ban.
She's okay.
That's good info brother. I hope I didn't just sound simplistictly contrarian. You are right that we are probably a decade away from your local pharmacy shuttering. 

IMHO people who are borderline broke aren't going for medical care short term. Also in that same thought of people's economic situation, how many of these jobs that are getting added back part-time positions that don't qualify for insurance anyway?

I've personally never shopped ACA plans but I've always heard that it's expensive to be poor.
I hope over the years the school gathered the data of what types of students made the best plays. Was it the quiet, smart one? The bully? The loud obnoxious one? Or the retard in the corner.

I think I'm more impressed by your Dad having more than one Roth IRA account.  That's some next level backdoor Roth shit right there.
What should I do with my 1000 honest opinion 🤔
It's an option on $PLTR that expires on 11/27 for a price of 18 per share. The premium is .75 per share. Because options are always bought and sold in blocks of 100, the total cost is $75
Any reasons I shouldn’t add more January VTRS calls?

Tomorrow Tesla calls or puts? Any suggestions
If TSLA closes over $500 today we mooning all the way to inclusion
Pltr has tegrity. Google and fb are the ones already spying on you. Pltr is bipartisan because the government is run by the people. It's proven our democracy is being attacked by foreign nations and by larger then life corporations. As more people understand what this does.

Student loans shouldn't be cancelled. Imagine being on the hook to fund some chicks women's studies degree all so she can be a barista at starbucks after. Especially if you worked hard and busted your ass off to pay off your own student loans. I'd be so fucking mad.

Student loans forces some sort of accountability in students to not take women's studies degrees and that makes the US all the better for it because people are disincentivized from wasting their time and taxpayer dollars on a useless major.
I just feel like it is all over the moment one of these fuckers explodes, which inevitably one will.
I'm kidding. Won't know yet.
So from 18 to 24 you have to risk your life for your right, but at 25 it’s simply given? That’s some ❄️ mental gymnastics.
imagine all the suffering experienced by all living things ever, imagine that it all comes from a single source, whatever people have called the “devil” throughout time, what should the payback be?

that would mean the squeeze isnt likely before the dec put date
Doing up
You want pltr to stay above 18 to collect the 75 premuim. Doing a cash secured put is safer than buying outright as you keep 75 prem. So worse case is you get 100 shares of pltr at 17.25 cost basis. Its like buying at discount. You may not get assigned as long as pltr is above 18. However if you just outright buy it its 18.78 right now.

They should make a gambling service where we bet on other peoples live portfolios. Have options like green/red daily. Option plays rated in 0 to 10 baggers. Maybe even account value in X months. Months to bankruptcy. C'mon guys!

Those points mostly make sense to me, I just don't think you get to realize the benefits of all of them in the near term. If approval happens, you'll get a step up in valuation, but then the company likely raises more capital, and then you see how commercialization goes. Maybe they acquired right away and you get an control premium on top of the normal valuation step up. If company gets a distributor, they'll split revenues but you'd expect a lower risk commercial launch. I havent seen any 10x moves from late trials to approval. That's why I said 2-3x (still real nice). I don't know how much more upside isn't accounted for by the market relative to what you've posted and what I imagine others are aware of.

The pandemic is not the only headwind against oil. Green energy pushes are (importantly) now on hyperdrive, at many scales. Invest in green hydrogen production, instead. eg the SPAC (soon merging) HCCH.

Found the retard. Stonk movement is viewed in percentage. It went up 3.19% on Thursday. It was $18.04 on 11/10 and is now $26.23. That's 45% return in less than 2 weeks.
Honestly that would be fucked.
That’s a good point, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase have plans to create Haven, a company that provides lost cost healthcare to all their employees. I think the company is still in its infantile stages and it is unclear whether they want to directly compete with insurance companies or whether they’re building a product that integrates with them. Either way WSB is mostly interested in the near term and I think that the vaccine news along with a Biden victory boosts the prospects of the American Care Act staying which should in term boost the price of UNH and the healthcare sector more broadly over the coming few weeks.
Actually, they can but it usually is asymptomatic. They think there is a small chance of them spreading it. I think it was released fairly recently in CDC or WHO pressers.

Edit: Probably rare as fuck but it has happened.

Pltr if you want to sell cash secured put you need about 15k-18k in your acct. if you sold 11/27 18p you get .75 credit for each share or 75 bucks for 1 contract=100 shares. Your cost basis  if you get assigned would be 17.25 share and you would  receive 100 shares of pltr at cost basis of 17.25

* COTY had a huge surprise earnings beat on Nov 6 (Rev and EPS beat) with great guidance, mainly because of a huge decrease in YoY fixed costs. 

* They brought on Kylie Jenner's cosmetics line, which had great performance this year.

* Citigroup analyst price upgraded it from $4.5 to $10 today

* New CEO and upper management have given investors more confidence in the company due to the above earnings beat

* Executive Chairman Peter Harf just bought $150m worth of stock back from the KKR hedge fund, who will own a 60% majority stake in all of COTY's hair brands (wella, clairol, etc) as of 11/30/20 in a $2.5bn deal that will cut COTY's outstanding debt by 33%. The chairman doing a share buyback like this is extremely bullish, this was 3 days ago.

* Most of COTY's brands are cheap and affordable - cost-effective cosmetics are absolutely recession/market crash proof, no matter how bad times are, cosmetics sales are always consistently high

* Finally and, in my eyes, most importantly: COTY is refocusing HARD on tapping into the Chinese cosmetics market with tailor-made lines specifically customized to prevailing consumer tastes in those regions. Q1 of FY21 saw double-digit sales growth across many COTY fragrance and cosmetics brands (Gucci, Burberry, etc) in China - if COTY can continue expanding this foothold, the sky is the limit for profits with the humongous new Chinese customer base.

Boom, there you go dude, company outlook is really really strong in my eyes, I'm currently playing short positions but definitely eyeing mid-to-long if the current growth sustains.

Thanks dude if there’s anything I can offer I was actually doing decent with theta until I overleveraged into one company and that company kept dipping I believed in it too much so it took my porfolio down negative . No matter what opportunity is present always have to balance the portfolio
Is that a gut feeling or did news come out?
Theyll literally go pay rent somewhere else cheaper. Housing is a constant
Oh yeah, only governments will actually buy the vaccine, and everyone would want to have the vaccine earlier and get over the pandemic as early as possible. Earlier you end the pandemic, earlier the economies will grow. And governments would not want untested vaccine and potentially kill its citizens, it would kill their political career. So they would prefer to get whatever is approved by FDA and WHO. And there is enough demand for any approved vaccine.
Netflix is a stupid play

Yeah, swinging shares is so much more relaxing then gambling with options. Less exhilarating, but I’m actually getting results. Finally dug myself out of the hole that options put me in. Also, I discovered that u can use way more leverage on shares than you can with options, so your buying power actually increases. Good luck man.

Interesting will look into this, but from Geekbench doesn't seem that way - [https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks](https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks)
He was giving out gold to anyone who mentioned TSLA the night before it mooned so fucking hard. That was already after a day of mooning from S&P inclusion. Does he do this before every moon?
Idk I think they are going to do sports betting.
I kinda enjoyed 1984 tbh
Super weird that AAPL bought beats. Kinda feel like they ran that into the ground
Ah yes a fellow COTY man. All aboard.
Imagine poor people driving EV's.

Yeah you’re right that there’s no forced short covering with only one share and not a marketplace but it was meant as a simplifying example.
They are also integrating sports betting.

I'm not comparing TSLA and NIO to weed stocks. I'm comparing SOLO and FUV. Have you seen their "product"?
Nah, priced in, markets knows 🥭 will pull all kinds of shit that 😴 will reverse
Tesla? Keep my calls till next week? Or sell at open?
Loading up on puts in February and March then leaps immediately after would have easily made you billions. I think you'd have to be worried about a lot more than the SEC at that point.

It's a great idea, my company is making moves to participate
My puppy and I both got diarrhea. We’re bonding
better yet, AAPL buys TSLA and world domination.

Almost time to yolo this gold dip.
Oof. Bro. 360 maybe. 365?! Oof.
I've actually been doing a financial analysis project of Tyson in my accounting class the last month or so. Their financials are pretty solid and their revenue is at an all time high of course. Some of their financial data points have degraded from previous years, but overall their commitment towards keeping short term debt low, adapting to market demand changes, and improving their financial efficiency is working well for them. I can get you more specific information about year to year turnover ratios, etc, if you are interested in looking at the docs I've put together on it. I'm high and laying in bed, so DM me if so.
Why not both
Imagine if AAPL ever actually announced a car. The cap shift from TSLA to AAPL would probably be the biggest single day move of that kind in history.
I think their premarket numbers (the ones that come out before 4) are a projection. They put them out so people looking for a price at 2am go to their site.
Souicy.

Affirm gives 12 month no interest loans to people to buy things. They hope it's the new rent-a-center and that people blow past the no interest period and start paying interest at 25%. They probably also get a cut of the sale when the customer makes a purchase.

They both will make money out of this. The demand is there for both vaccines. If both are FDA approved, they will both rise. It’s not blue vs red. It is vaccine vs covid-19.

I bought an electric car (brag) about a year ago. A really basic one (not brag). But it was super obvious that almost anyone that spent time driving an EV wouldn’t ever go back to an ICE.

Thanks man, my gf and I lost our grandmothers like two weeks apart last year (both equally poor health). I left the hospital after my grandmother passed to go see her still coherent grandmother at the hospital across town and I couldn't even tell my gf that mine had passed for a day or so because I didn't want her to lose hope. Her grandmother asked me how mine was doing and I straight up lied and said she was fine. Seemed like a really shitty thing but now I know that it was a better outcome than what we'd have now. Sorry if this is kinda dragging, it was a tough time.

I have jan 22 $15 leap that ill probably be selling soon, its up almost 300%
Absolutely not.
Like Tesla?
yeh sure. the entire world will transition to solar and wind. Solar and wind require batteries to operate. Tesla makes the batteries and solar. so the worlds energy needs will be at least partially met by tesla. It isn’t about the cars they sell, it’s the energy.
Yes, it is too late. The market will open again in the morning though.
Geez they're at 9 seasons now? I remember I caught a glimpse of it on tv once and one season had magic and witches and shit
Slack is pretty beat up atm, bottomed out at 25 and usually runs up to the low 30s before earnings( i have made the same play twice before). apart from that, everything I see is pretty fucking overbought atm, can't see a big play unless market's crashing. I'd love that.
it's been 6 months, read up on different stock market investment methods, terms and lingo, strategies and then take a look at how other people have gained and lost money. do this for a few hours a day, you should be very knowledgeable in just a couple weeks. Yes it's very valuable to learn from your mistakes, but learning from the mistakes of others is priceless. Seriously, at least keep up with all the posts on this sub and separate the memes from the serious talks. you should at least know what leaps are by now
And retards
On what
And that’s just shares. You could make utterly enormous money timing the crash, and then load up on massively OTM NIO leaps afterward with that profit. Those two plays alone would make absolutely insane amounts of money.

ticker GP is for US and GPV for the canadian market. They mostly operate in the states though.
Tell him to also buy PLTR. If you dislike him tell him to buy puts.
The only thing i can tell you about COTY is it's like the PG and Nestle of beauty products. Stable, not going anywhere for a while.

The only other big news is from their competitor, ChargePoint, which is currently being reverse merge with SBE to go public at the end of Q4.

Is 😴 going to uncancel TikTok? Will they secede from the ORCL deal? Is there a way to trade this?
What spec?
Well realistically yes it is a gamble because we’re betting on something with a really low probability of happening. So I guess I’ll stick to making 5% a week trading equities on my $10,000 with low risk where I have more control and then use the money I make from that to bet on the SPY if I build a solid enough catalyst with a reasonable time frame.
do some research, at least on stock market terms and lingo, before going out and gambling 2k my guy

COTY is mooning tomorrow isn’t it 😒 of course it is because I sold my $6c way too early
Pfizer sends docs to seek FDA Approval tomorrow. Assuming the FDA approves Pfizer within the next few days, I would expect it to moon. 📈
Bill gates said 2000 people will die everyday by January so markets booming
Be careful tomorrow retards. Most of the spec coming out tonight is predicting a rough day tomorrow. Jump out of EV if it gets turbulent. Investors are nervous and clearly the fed is too. 

Tomorrow is the first day in a long time I would recommend hanging on the sidelines and only jumping in on easy plays. There’s a good chance a lot of retards in here are going to get hurt tomorrow. 

Be safe.
NIO🥰
Anyone got any good DD on COTY? Calls looking pretty juicy for Jan/Feb.

Before a vaccine is out, you buy oil, entertainment, (maybe airlines), hotel, cruises and get out off the FAANG stocks.

I got downvoted for saying tiktok owner should get deported back to wuhan if I said beijing it would be politically correct ..... O society ur so soft

For sure. In so many ways. That's the main reason I chose to study psych instead of engineering. People are interesting but far more complex than machines.
Yes the 7:1 spit was meant for making sure that it could ipo on the us market.
Kinda shitty to say, but I'm sort of glad that my grandmother passed last year. She was in very poor health and wouldn't have made it through corona when we all caught it here. She passed surrounded by family instead of alone in a quarantine wing at an overcrowded hospital. Can't even imagine how those losing isolated loved ones in the ICU right now feel. I keep hearing stories from some states that fathers sometimes aren't being allowed in to see their kids born. 😔😔
356.4 (-.43%) based on the current /ES, choppy up and down either way although recently up
2024, hahaha. Won’t happen. People have short memories and the GOP knows he’s toxic to the brand. They already have a list of candidates.
Biden confirmed no economic shutdown, SPY aftermarket reflected by spiking from a -0.86% low to 0%. Spy calls are the play, feel like an idiot for selling my 11/20 calls for a 75% loss in the morning.
imagine nicknaming your dick NQ
Ask Glen Bradford dudes been going mental these past few months.

What’s the play tomorrow y’all retards? Best 0dte?
can tell u right now there aint no asian girls named halsey. first giveaway right there.
Well, a return on your gamble, but yes. If you think those conditions will be met and enough to push it to $395+ go for it. But that's a decision only you can make for yourself.
i bought like 50 spxl calls for friday a couple days ago cause they were exfremely cheap and they were down to 0.01 today, haha. mught actually brrak even tomorrow on those

Did you try logging out and logging back in?
The urban clothes brand?
Thanks man
Y are u gae?
It’d be good for blind people.
is 24% APR good? Anyways these 11/20 525 TSLA calls should cover it💪
My catalyst for SPY hitting $400 is institutions will feel more comfortable buying in the markets again due to political stability with the Biden presidency (dems are pro wallstreet and markets perform 3 times better on average under democratic presidency) also the vaccine news and the mania from retail investors will pump the markets to all time highs. The biggest pump and dump in history will basically happen. Betting that all of that happens in 50 days is quite the risk.
So Pfizer is FDA approved also? They're a big company and also cheaper, so I can buy more stock of it but it's a coin flip at the moment in my opinion. If you have anymore info please tell, we're all retards here my friend :)
How bad are you down that you’re trying to pump it
Nobody mentioned it here idiot
Or maybe like stop throwing your money at dumb trades when you don't have any to spare

I would. I can´t belive it does not exist already. I would chose three major indicies just to keep track and then set it to repeat current level every 2-3 minutes... or maybe that would drive one mad.. How about a banner in your screen that lets chosen tickers roll continuesly.
Playing the market is like a fucking video game man. You have seen the Game Over screen, finished the New Game Plus mode, and now just wanting to get the highest score possible. It's fun to see your score gets higher every month, and it's fucking addicting.
Creepy
That's a good plan, but I'm betting on Elon's big 3 companies, mostly Tesla, being a key factor in Mars (and wayyy beyond) colonisation, we'll need a lot of energy, so I wouldn't sell then, but I really like that you have a plan and a very long term one at that :)

And yes I dream big, but it's closer than anyone thinks
Gobble up pltr

We have the fucking president of the US calling for election results to be overturned and you think some stupid tween app drama is dumb?
NIO shares alone will make you millions. It’s up 2,000% lol
Market loves to “price in” shit on a rumor. So with vaccines out in 3-4 weeks (a few million doses for frontline workers and such) the market seems shaky still, uncertain where it wants to put its money.
I guess you didn’t pick up on the sarcasm, you dumb retard

There was a 7:1 reverse split no?
Don’t know what this means. But if it’s NIO, buy it.
Make sure he shows up for Thanksgiving with grandma. Invest that inheritance in Tesla calls.
Interest rates lower -> bonds lower interest rates -> bonds less attractive -> equities more attractive. You don’t need inflation of the CPI to have inflation in stock prices.

Also banks loading up on bonds as “safe assets” is a laugh given banks blow up their accounts routinely like WSB degens and get bailed out by the tax payer. If there’s anything to learn it’s to inverse the banks. 

That said I have some hedges. I do think there’s a good chance we’re overvalued.

I've already placed my order on Alibaba.  The first 4 sellers wanted too much and the minimum order was too high.  I was finally able to find a seller that would customize a few things for me.  Added a moonroof and Harry Potter \[sic\] interior trim.  Getting 1000 of them shipped to me.  $40k for a single EV or $600 for a minimum of 1000.  PM me if you want one.  I'll be selling them for $1000, but you have to arrange for transportation within the US. I also ordered a bunch of NIO paraphernalia.  Coffee cups, wallets, laptops, fidget spinners, frisbees, stress balls, mouse pads, t-shirts, sleep masks, pens.  I'll be selling these exclusive, genuine NIO items for $1 each.
ex-intel more reason not even mess with them, the only reason intel was ahead of the game with amd, was because amd wasn't very successful with multi core chips, they were innovative but ahead of their time, so most programs couldn't make use of multicores, intel focuses on less cores but added hyper threading which made their fx line up and other server grade cpu's inferior, other than that intel was overpriced garbo just like apple.

Thanks. 10 years here. Jesus
Fucking weird, I was reading earlier about TAKOF a drone start up that's been gaining some traction. But its still penny stock and will likely be crushed by UPS drone or something.
I'm bullish on PLTR and I've had puts on it for two days now to protect my position.
Positive news kept coming out. Still have a bunch of  50c 11 20 active. Its going to moon tomorrow over 50 so should be nice gains
exactly. it's the weed
Tendies are good, but would you buy their car?
Facts
Posivibes only king 👑
50 days is a stretch tho 👀 is it worth the risk?
Thinking the same esp if we get a green day. Shit is getting crazy out there.
Most likely I mean there's a chance no one does anything but it's doubtful
Didn’t know wallstreet existed in Canada

The first one is always free man!
How are futures looking retards
Probably withdrew money
hear hear
USB ports not included
So basically if I buy right now $395 strike Jan 21 calls on SPY With a $1,200 investment I’ll make $10,789 theoretical p/l at expiry. This is according to the snapshot risk/reward analysis on power e trade. So that means the SPY has 50 days to hit $400 for me to make $10,000 basically a 1,000% return on my investment.
Simple fact is truth is coming out. I fully expect to win this bet. A lot of people will open their eyes to the bigger picture.. A lot of people will continue to eat the propaganda in disregard for their own self interests. Nothing is free. Freedom is not free.
you guys remember back in the old days when futures used to move and shit

Good times
Oh my fuck, I’m stressed for you bro.
so are the europoors gonna sell or buy
McDonald’s is in the real estate business and they have McDonald’s as tenants so they know they’ll get their rent !
But at least you have cake...Congrats!
Unfortunately I have about $120k in PSX calls that expire at close today

I have another round of the $65c for 12/18 calls that are much more likely to hit, just have to hold out on the high volatility. I’m expecting $75 by then which will pay off the expired calls. Luckily I bought these contracts on that dip I mentioned above so I’m actually still up despite the recent downswings

Almost all of the energy companies Tuesday and Wednesday touched the 200 day moving average and bounced down, I’m pretty confident they’ll breach soon. XLE I think closed right above it today but will head back down until the Cali news bakes in

Again looking at Bollinger bands, PSX broke the upper band the other day before that 7% swing down and it’s still walking straight up the upper band. This is just normal even if volatile

I don’t want to swing trade at this point cause you can miss news that moves it, but selling as it breaches the top Bollinger band and buying as it hits the middle average wouldn’t be bad
Put in an order for market open. Why was this one so quiet?

EV & SPACs are definitely getting into tippy top region, but I think there’s still time to bank.
Moment you sell, you’ll see amd rally and palantir pull back,
If you dont sell amd, amd will stay stagnant and palantir will continue to moon.
When you finally fomo into palantir, it’ll definitely retrace at that point.

Correct.
Fuck mate that is rough. Hope he pulls through.

My father (70) recently had a heart attack and already has pre-existing lung problems so I'm terrified he will catch it.

Fuck Covid-19.
This stock ipo'd at 20 and got hit hard by a short piece not long after and dropped all the way down to 10 dollars a piece. I do believe at this current price, the stock is still undervalued for what they have already put on the table. 

Notable highlight for this quarter:

\- secured 100 ev stars order ( valued at 100k each car so 10m in potential revenue)

\- secured 16 school buses ( valued at 1mil each bus so 16m in potential revenue)

\- able to produce 20 ev stars a month and 3 beasts a month starting next quarter

\- delivered 20 ev stars this quarter  

They have wide range of products from the transportation buses to school buses and to cargo vans. The Beast, the school bus, has been getting a lot of attention lately because it simply has the best specs out of all the ev school buses at a cheaper price point than most competitors. Its all cool and all but the real gem of the company lies upon their ev star series which is the only vehicle in same category that passes the altoona test with a whooping score of 92 meaning that they are the only eligible vehicle of the category to get the 80% subsidy from the FTA fund. The ev stars is super flexible, customizable and can take on payload up to 6000 pounds which blows all competitors out of water. The ev stars are really have been test ran at san deigo airport for a while and have been the only operating transportation vans that they have been running during the pandemic. Green commuters initially placed 100 orders and went in for another 100 after the positive experience they have with the ev stars series. Overall i am really bullish on this company and what they can put out in the future. Truly an overlooked ev company that has been delivering solid products and results.
I thought these guys were top secret government agency peanut planters.

How long should i hold my Tesla calls? They expire the 27th
Lol right? If you knew about all the pump and dumps you could easily have billions even starting with a few hundred bucks. For example if you played 25 different pump and dumps and 85%(there have been many more than that) you'd have 10 billion. Obviously once you had millions to spend it'd be hard to put it ALL into something without actually affecting the pump but still.
COSTCO is the play when Hoarding 2.0 takes over Black Friday?

Not necessarily. Depends on the severity of the male pattern baldness. Some people are programmed to lose virtually all head hair eventually.

Not to mention that even if that's not the case, the hair loss can continue just after the range of the implants.

So you basically have a fringe of nice hair at the front, but the top is going to continue to bald.


Though all of that can be completely stopped by blocking DHT... 

Either through finasteride (huge side effect risk of depression that does not go away after quitting the drug)


Or just being trans and going on testosterone blockers + estrogen.
Look at the numbers. There’s something amiss. I suspect they announced the plan to initiate a stock buy back up to $1B is because they’re mitigating the risk of negative market sentiment.
not everyone who's concerned is short on cash, some have plenty of assets but sell to provide that cash liquidity

Hahahaha just to share some gains
[deleted]
Okay, first: genuinely seriously thank you for opening up and sharing that. Just voicing the concern is a big thing, and I appreciate it.

In terms of what's up... I can't diagnose anything, so I won't say "oh that's PTSD," but it sounds like you might just be having - totally normal - difficulties readjusting to civilian life. People have trouble moving from emotionally toxic homes to being safe on their own, going from "will these rockets kill me?" to "am I going to have trouble buying clorox wipes?" is going to be a hell of a lot more taxing. And that's okay!

You aren't emotionless. You'd be laughing off the relationship strife if you were. You're just going through it, and it's taking an emotional toll.

At any rate, it sounds like you're trying to replace the high-stress environment of your deployment with the high-stress and cash risk of the options market... but if I'm hazarding a guess that's probably not a great coping mechanism for you?

If you're just trading to feel something and there's no greater goal or purpose to it, it's likely a symptom of a bigger issue, like not being able to feel "normal" (not the best word, but bear with me) without the stress. Again, I'd suggest talking to a counselor (or just starting with a close friend?) about the whole situation. You deserve to feel things, and to feel satisfied or happy without staking money on it, and that could at least help you explore the feelings further?
😰😰
Depends. Loan terms and source?
The parabolic surge will be instant...or it’s priced in

KNDI apparently has their own proprietary battery swapping technology.

Also their cars are very affordable compared to most other EV companies so that means they will sell in higher numbers to consumers.

It's a solid company with great potential. I think their model EX3 looks the best out of all.
Too late to get in? How did you guess to stay in when it dropped after earnings?

Look at the last three months, every time vaccine news hits it spikes. However, you do know that for SPY to hit 400, the S&P would also have to reach $4000? I mean it's possible especially with TSLA joining the S&P and possible first wave of vaccines... it'll be amazing if it all comes together for you.

Is this real? What episode 👀
Dollar popped right off the yearly low and is going to retrace up a little which will fuel more selling tomorrow.  Stay woke.

Basically, if by that time vaccine news hits, markets going full mania.
Why has dollar been drilling? Are these red futures fake, n green days ahead until 2021 when foreclosure n defaults become a real problem again  ?
No way this actually happened.
Because  mods got together and brainstormed how they could become even more gay. They landed on “let’s pin DD to the top regardless of how dogshit it is.”
False
Think I’m done with stocks, shit is too dumb for me valuations don’t make sense so your left in the dark gambling up down up down not making shit  and If you really want to make big money you have to take extraordinary amount of risks just not worth it gonna stick to real estate and focus on my business more and gamble small if I’m gonna play this game
What a twist!

Good advice on wsb? What is this? 1999?
there's a huge difference between weed and EV

the short answer is the government sells SHITTY weed compared to a drug dealer.

EV are being thought of as the future and some countries want to do MUHHH green power and making it mandatory, or have future plans towards moving towards a ''green'' future or whatever bullshit, either way countries like japan is planning to become electric and the usa and other 1st world countries want to ban gas vehicles or at least stop their production almost every car manufacturer is starting to make their electric vehicles due to tesla's success
So you want to bet that SPY is going to hit an all-time high of $400 on January 21, 2021. Holy shit man, super proud of you if it prints.
Yes. Put your money in 1 or 2 reputable Etf's and DO NOT touch options.

I held Blink from $7 to $15, rode back to $7, then stagnated a month or so. Ended up selling $10 covered calls, it decided to double this week (my expiry week). Stonks often do completely unexplainable things, especially IPOs and small caps.
Retard + 🎱 = this comment
Y'all checking stock prices in different countries is funny asf
Millenials are too much in debt/ too poor to buy cars. They don't know what regular cars are and what drives people to buy them. Some dude comes up with photoshop renders of EVs and tells millenials why this changes everything. Millenials go further in debt to buy stocks of that scam hoping to finally have some money. Yet they have no clue how mature the auto market is and what motivates their rich boomer relatives to change their cars. Millenials are in for quite a shock. But who cares it wasn't their money in the first place.
Sounds good thank you!!!

6 months ago I was in Iraq and I remember hunkering down in a bunker with my men when the sirens went off for incoming, not knowing if me and my men would live or die. The base got hit by Katyusha rockets, and there were casualties. There was lots of fear, anxiety, and chaos. This all pales in comparison to the anxiety and exhilaration I get from options trading. Puts on my mental stability, my emotional intellect, and capacity for empathy.

I'm not saying anything, just thinking out loud. 

NVDA is mentioned because if integrated graphics can perform at this level, there is no need for discrete cards on laptops (maybe even gaming desktops in a few years time). Yes ARM merger is in process (could be rejected still due to anti-trust/geo political issues) but that doesn't mean this trend can't cannibalize it's own discrete gpu business segment. 

Have you heard of market cannibalization?

You're gonna YOLO on SPY? The same SPY that's being propped up by vaccine news and nothing else? Do me a favor and look at the last 3 months of SPY and tell me what price you'd strike at.
Congrats! I dumped more money into it!!! Big PUMP TMR 🚀🚀🚀
The thing is, even if i drops in two months; by that time I'll have made so much gains that I won't notice nothing but a scratch, so why pull out my money, miss out on gains, and if it doesn't drop I have to buy in at all time highs and by that time this guy is probably ready with another master thesis on why this green rocket ship mania is predicted to experience one red day in about 10 years

The point on QE seems alright, but the data on credit doesn't conclusively support his postulation.

If what you say about banks and bonds is true, we'd probably have seen an increase in the rate at which banks are purchasing bonds with the steep run up of equity recently. 

Unemployment rate has been on the decline since peak of the pandemic and is sharply decreasing.

If you’re talking shares. Pltr is really promising no reason why they can’t land a couple more clients and balloon up to 50 billion valuation or 100 billion valuation. 10 billion a year in revenue 5 billion profit that’s a 100 billion valuation.

Sleepy, you know he's pretty tired when his core voters are deceased.
TSLA drilling to the core in germany
Dude, it's nothing. 10k at most. If you can't swing that, you really shouldn't be in the market...sry just sayin
It's actually the memes that dictate the future direction of the market. Like Geese flying south for the summer.
TBH, selling TSLA calls would have also been pretty dumb.
Really depends on their ability to scale their architecture. It's very obvious the current architecture borrows heavily from iPhone/iPad SOCs which can be seen from the limited connectivity (see low number of Thunderbolt ports on Macbook Pro 13 and the Mini).

If they can sort out higher core-count architecture (which is the stupidly hard part... interconnect, cache coherency protocol, etc) and also bring their I/O up to speed with what we are seeing from AMD then it has legs.

However I do feel like the next generation of big desktops from Apple are still going to be x86. They might be AMD instead of Intel but they won't be ARM likely for another 2 years or so unless Apple has been really hard at work for atleast 4-5 years on this high core count architecture stuff.

Though that out of the way the key important metric here is that they were able to deliver more efficient and faster cores.

My inuition tells me this is mostly down to these being ground-up AArch64 designs. For those unfamiliar with the history of 64bit architecture of x86-64 suffice to say it's a big fucking hack and really inefficient in it's usage of single byte instructions and has other idiosyncrasies that result in the processors needing massive "frontends" as we call them which convert instructions into microcode which is what the processor actually executes.
AArch64 is -not- an extension of the original ARM ISA but rather a completely new one which is more modern and makes best use of the single byte instruction space (single byte in instructions are preferably both for binary size and for optimising frontend for most common cases).

So future is bright but I wouldn't underestimate just how fucking hard it is to get this stuff right. Apple has done well thus far but without the likes of Jim Keller or another chip savant it will be difficult to come out with a highly scalable design that can beat the modern Ryzen designs with their chiplets, interconnect and decades of experience in these bigger/faster high TDP chips.
Where you at europoors!
Everyday is a green day, don't doubt bull strength 💪
yeah I hate this. When market is green we hold, when market is red we move (sell or buy).

But on the street, when light is green we move, and when it is red we hold. It's such a bad user experience, we should ask the government to flip the traffic lights color meanings.
Palantir has not been profitable since inception. Tesla seems to do accounting tricks just to appear profitable. It is not profitable directly from selling their cars. Docusign not yet profitable is mind-boggling. It is an electronic product. What is their most expensive operating cost that they are not profitable? I can go on and on.

These companies make great products, but they still need positive cash flow.

SEC made Elon more rich because he had to buy 20 million of stock after the court case (to pay for Tesla's obligation) which is worth way more.

Ohio shouldn’t be lumped in with South Dakota. You’re totally right. I think this is why messaging at a federal level is important while leaving the implementation up to each state. 

Also - contact tracing. If the local nail salon invested in plexi, masks & better air filtration, & has seen 0 cases spread - it’s ridiculous to force them to shut down (again).

Spread seems to be at social gatherings. Shutting down all non-essential businesses because people are having house parties is so unfair.
PLTR is not overbought or technically unhealthy. It’s just chillin in it’s uptrend and will be 20-30-40-100 in the months to come.

If you are interested in some quality work on the theory behind it, check out some stuff by this guy Adam Smith. Kinda dry compared to freakonomics or Malcom Gladwell, but it's interesting stuff.
U can open Custodial Roth IRA at 16. Just talk to ur parents/guardian and set it up. It automatically gets transferred to u at 18 I think and it’s the same as a regular Roth IRA.

THIS. I've played weeklies yeah, am I a retard maybe but do I also own stonks and sell CCs on em to get the milk from a cow that some boomer is paying me to feed? Yeah. That milk gets sold to buy LEAPS so delta buys my next cow. Weeklies are miniscule plays in a portfolio that pays itself to grow. Have you ever been to a casino with a few bucks to have fun? Many have, its fun. It's only retarded if you put the deed to your house on red 17.

How much did you lose?
I got in tech during March. It's been trading sideways and typically, I would wait for the next jump. But this reckless investing (IMO) is causing concern. I am thinking of selling long-term calls against my shares as a hedge. It runs up, then okay, I sell my shares at a higher price or roll out. If it crashes or continues sideways, then I make money off premiums, and wait for the recovery.
When my wife’s girlfriend and I have sex she’s always like ohh NIO, CRSR, AAL, BA and I’m like word
Well because it’s you versus theta gang. Theta gang is unlikely to sell you that call option cheaply, because it’s so likely to happen. So you’re going to pay a huge premium if you can buy it at all. Likely as not no one will sell it to you.
The 35k gain was all me. Listening to him got me to double down.
As someone who didn't make it big, I can confirm locking the gains is the key.

Pretty sure we dropped after the first US vaccine announcement. Tech did at least.
One of the things that pushed me to a bearish position this week is one of my co-workers who has approx 1.5mil in his ira got a unsolicited call from his ira manager and said he felt the market was about to turn downward and wanted to move him to cash and bonds for the short term.  Said he wanted to do it immediately.  This was wednesday.

They make a lot of other chips that are far superior than competition (A1, S1 etc) and they never license it. Half of the magic with these chips is the tight software and hardware interaction that only Apple can do. I bet this chip won’t be as fast with windows running on it

I read an article from a nerd talking about this. He was basically saying one of the biggest reasons why Apple is killing it, is because it’s vertically integrated. It controls everything about the computers from the parts to the apps. Other separate companies have to work together to make a single laptop, which doesn’t always work out.

To me that sounds like they would have a huge advantage of keeping this tech. I’m also on this sub and very retarded so don’t believe me.

Feb calls will print.
I know the whole college athlete’s being paid issue can be complex but I gotta say: If they get in on a sports scholarship and get injured, schools should *not* be allowed to revoke their scholarships if they meet GPA requirements. That should be a risk/investment made by the school.

Hell yeah man! They are actually opening the second megastore in Santa Ana, California in the first half of 2021! Got the licensing and the location built out. The Cali market will be a lot more competitive and that's where we will see if their business model holds up. I think it will and that they will expand more once they've proved they can do it again. They plan on being in every major city that can support a pro sports team.

Baba gang how we looking?
Rotation back to tech!!
We have each other at least
SPAC’s. They follow a very predictable pattern. Once an interesting LOI is announced, they usually shoot up and then slowly drop back down to around $12 over the next few weeks/months. Then, usually, when they get close to a merger they’ll ramp back up again and you can time the bottom, buy shares, and ride it up.
I’m not sure I believe in this housing recovery ... doesn’t mean that stock won’t go up though.
My God, I hope you're trolling.

There are some reckless retards on here... 

But you just walked up to the roulette table and told the dealer to put it all on purple.  

There's no way you can win.
that’s why mnuchin kept getting her over for meetings
Awesome trade retard. Should have put $25,000 on it.
How can she want to be rich and then say capitalism is evil. Being "rich" is having more than the next person. Walking contradiction. Dump her.
Deeper than the hole we are digging one day at a time.
There is options though
That’s the most boomer thing I’ve heard today
My man
I once took a shit in an absolute filthy portapotty at a music festival while peaking on acid and the bass from the adjacent stage was causing the entire thing to shake.  At night.  Wearing overalls.
Lmaoo yes I’ve seen you shitposting your heart out here

You can say whatever tf you want in the wsb daily thread it’s great
100% is a bold move, I love it. Hard to argue with taking that profit though.
Sounds about white
Absolutely nothing compares with how fast the iphones are and how smooth. Not to mention, they have support for more than 3 years and their apps are developed much better than android apps. Android is nice if you don't want to spend much on a phone, but it doesn't work as good and isn't as pretty of a ui.
Reddit’s popular page is full of this “capitalism is evil”

“Rich people bad”

“I’m an unskilled worker, why am I not upper class?”

Just a ton of complaining about their financial situation while also doing nothing to improve it
NASDAQ GREEN BIGLY BEARS R FUK

Nah dude, ChargePoint is legit long term, not sure about options though.
Don't even know which one it is. I just hate the user interface.  After android, everything just feels difficult to do rather than intuitive. Not criticising the hardware necessarily, though even there I feel like they lag android.

I'm on a Huawei P30 Pro which I think is an amazing phone for the time I bought it. Now Huawei is a bit fucked. I'd probably go OP but I'm not the best person to ask. Try to keep my phones for a few years at least, and not really on top of the market.
It ain't the system that's evil it's humans.
Play at home by yourself with just a deck of cards. It’s good practice.
I do that but what about the other 23 hours and 58 minutes of the day
Short term life is comedy

Long term life is a tragedy
Lol my gf hates hearing about stocks too
It’s undervalued, but didn’t see a lot of analyst put the price target higher than like $34... usually stocks don’t trade too high past that valuation for a while unless some catalyst is there. That’s short term though... I do think this is a close to a $50 stock long term (or even higher if they keep there earnings up)
Thats how I feel about aapl

Ok so what are you saying? You think Apple will licence out its chips to other laptop companies instead of Intel and/or sell them separately so people can build their own PCs?

Or would they keep it all in house under the Apple brand?
China numba wan
don't worry bro she doesn't deserve you
Apple is never going to license this out. But the potential of this chip (and future ones) for apple is huge
I did at 495, sold for a profit at 730 and quickly realized I should've never sold. 

Bought back at 750 thankfully (150 today) and here we are today, 100% of my portfolio :)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost
Even though tech did well and everybody knows they are making money, it seems money is being thrown into small cap, electric vehicle, and covid-affected stocks, while tech trades sideways.

My guess is investors missed their opportunity getting in tech during the March drop, but need to put their money in something. Right now, the euphoria is in meme stocks. This is dotcom all over again. Tech may be expensive, but at least they are profitable and beating earnings. Some of these meme stocks have negative cash flow. Eventually, they will run out of money and it will be a race to sell. It is this type of trading that will cause the next crash.

For now, I'll dollar cost average on shares. I don't anticipate it rocketing to the moon. $20 by Feb is a realistic price target. It was looking pretty hot for a while, but I think it will take a breather.  


I expect PLTR to be on par with the tech giants given enough time.

Most times information overload works against you. You see the massive gains posts here in the recent past have all been made on one to Two tickers at most. Most of us on wsb look up tickers after they are mentioned here and fomo and keep chasing. Having a strong conviction in one and holding long is the way to do it. That said, I'm - 80% in my all time charts

I’m holding call spreads exp 12-18. Also have shares. Sold a covered call @ $9 earlier this week. Solo kept running up. Didn’t expect it lol. That covered call expires tomorrow. That’ll probably get called away :/ I’ll still have some shares tho.

Edit: will continue to hold shares. From what I understand solo isn’t making any kind of $$ yet so I’ll probably close out spreads once I’m up. Maybe snag a couple of leaps but not be too heavily invested in this one
A good steady 3-4% movement upwards for a couple of days should make the IV rise. For example, look at how TSLA's IV rose after the SPY inclusion announcement. The demand for options went up and hence the IV rose.

Yes yes yes yes do it do it do it.
My one regret at my last company was waiting so long to sign up for the ESPP (I worked for Accenture - ACN). A couple of friends of mine worked there for 7 years and set aside 10% of every paycheck.

Tell that to the refi market. People can sense shit is going on. The refi market is in insane historical volume territory. There isn't a single mortgage lender in the entire industry that isn't slammed to the wall 24/7 right now. Appraisals booked 60 days out ... even when they're nothing but drive by or even desktop appraisals. I called NFCU one time in the last few months, asked about refis, asked about closing timelines ... they said 90 - 180 days. People saw what happened in 2008. They know they can walk away with the cash when 10 million other people walk away with the cash at the same time. Only the responsible suckers that keep 20%+ equity are left hanging dry. And even after walking, they all get prime rates 3 years later. What are the banks going to do - lend to no one? Haha, right. The banks adjust their standards to whatever customers are available. It's a zero sum game like anything else. I was responsible in 2008, and got left behind as a result. I ain't making that same mistake again. The Fed wants to fuck up the system like this? I can't stop them. So I'm joining them. Chase the market up. Every 3 years while everything is sky rocketing, buy a new place at 95% LTV. Sell the old place to lock in the gains. Pay 1 bill each on 10 different credit cards. Ramp those credit lines up. When things start turning, balance transfer all 10 cards at $20k a pop into your bank account. Pull that $200k into cash, take a trip to Vegas. "Lose" all of the cash. And ride out the disaster. Eff the Fed. Eff the bankers. They're the ones that keep leveraging these systems to the hilt to squeeze out an extra ounce for themselves. They only have themselves to blame. When I try to be responsible, they screw me over. They're telling me to not be responsible.
Lock in your gains retard. Anyone who buys at these levels deserves the hot steamy dump they will most likely get.

Enjoy the ban that's incoming my man.
Is a short squeeze even possible to GME? What portion of those whom own the stock would not sell? I think most people who own shares, including institutional investors, will probably unload shares if the stock is $15-20.

The reason why the Volkswagen short squeeze happened was because over 90% of the shares were held by 2 companies and both companies didn't want to sell shares. So this lead to the shares rising from $200-$1000 a 5x rise since all the shorts had to purchase shares when virtually non were available.
Theres definitely going to be a dump if they stopped unlimited loans.

And with that, it’s time for the Lllllllightning Round! First caller, John from Florida!

Thank you John, that’s very kind of you to say

*I’m a 65 year old retiree, and I just sold my entire 401k to put it all into C currency, Chinese EV stocks, and weed stocks after my grandson told me that they were going up and up. Do you think I should buy more, hold tight, or sell?*

I think your grandson is very smart, and you shoullllllld

*presses button that says BUY BUY BUY and makes a Bull noise*

That’s a very diversified portfolio and you should only own hyper-speculative growth stocks that’s all the market cares about. I talk to fund managers all the time and they tell me the same thing. Your grandson is exactly correct, and I am not just saying this because I’ve found a young cohort that watches this show and I try to pander to what they want to hear and reenforce them

Anyways that’s it for the Lightning Round. Tomorrow we have a very special guest, he’s the CEO of another shitty EV company with a history of bankruptcies that has no discernible product but swears in a couple years of gathering capital that it’ll be the next Tesla. Highly recommend you tune in and dump whatever you have now into it

Meme stocks are stocks the majority decided to skip shorting despite good reasons because they prefer to follow the group. Remember autists here only fantasize about being independent and contrarian but mostly just follow the group in pump & dump ventures.

TSLA - Answer I gave to another person who asked about TSLA

If you're okay with missing out in case it just moons from here, then wait to buy around 447. Otherwise, buy at any price. It's near ATHs so could just keep going up.

FUV - Wow, this went to the moon. Personally, I wouldn't touch this unless it pulled back to around $10 but if you really want to jump in, around $13 if it even pulls back that far. 

ZM - This looks like it could go to at least 445. For an aggressive entry, around 415. A safer entry would be around 396-397 but it might not pull back that far. If price just drops down from here to those lower prices, then I'd lower my sell target to around 425.

I dumped about 3k (only just shares) on BABA today but I’ve got a bad feeling it’s just gonna dump again tomorrow now. Just to fuck with everyone who thought yesterday was the bottom
Baba actually means father in Chinese
What is the big deal? I do it... I only have $500 in my account right now
They're spending so much on factories and getting wider profits by the day, if price per share stays at 500, they should get to a pe of around 25 in less than 5 years imo. 

Nio still has to spend a lot more but yes, low market cap, and there's more than enough room for many ev oems. I don't believe they have nearly as good engineers as Tesla but they can be 2nd. I just don't think it'll grow as much as Tesla though, but we'll see.

Also, it being a Chinese company, I'll have a hard time trusting it with my money, but that's just paranoid me.
Tomorrow we break thru the glass ceiling and make 🌈🍼🍼off themselves we’re so green ATHs like no-one has ever seen. Ripping gaping holes into them. SPY 370!!! LFG!!!

Yeah, you're definitely not wrong. This is the first time I've seen it become widespread with Democrats before though.

I sold a good chunk today because it's been up so much this week. I would think tomorrow will be somewhat flat or down a bit. I'm probably wrong, but that's why I didn't sell everything.

I guess it makes sense since Xbox accounts for a fraction of Microsoft’s revenue and the PlayStation is way more important for Sony. 

You would expect the PlayStation to be more popular otherwise Sony is failing lol

Where's the wsb meetups? I don't actually want to meet you, I just wanna hear the stories about the party with blow, RH accounts being blown up, the circlejerk NIO/TSLA boys blowing each other, and which FD put buyers blow rich NIO dip buyers for rent money.

Basically just one big blowfest. Pure gay degeneracy.  Beautiful.

u/TSLA500EOD babe is this true? Did he?
Pltr is the future. Their already saving companies millions and soon billions with their software
30% of their revenue comes from PLTN. Slightly concerning for my taste. I know Klarna is already huge, and Affirm might do well. But 30% from 1 client? And Peleton? Eh.
wtf why

Amd was such a sleeper today. I sold my $90 Dec calls yesterday thinking we would dump more, then didn't buy back in this morning. I saw them slowly grinding up and should have bought back in, but was a greedy fuck because I thought I could get them cheaper later in the day FML now they are more expensive 🤡

It’s a post 10pm lockdown. Which is basically what’s already happening - maybe some outdoor bars are losing like an hour. Literally the whole state is like ‘uh, how does this change anything’
what level are u
Bought at 14 and sold at 17 like a tard. Hoping to slide back in soon.
Sold my FUV calls/stocks yesterday for a neat 50% when they were at 12, now they are at 16...still made a nice return, but damn, i wish i didn't paperhand that one!
Why? The suspense is killing me
I’ve got 15 contracts for tomorrow, $20. Is it a yolo if they were only $0.10 each?
Yes pltr will be 50$ by February
I can’t tell if that is agreeing of not
should've swallowed
DKNG 55 & 60s... i stress less about plays 1 week out because i view that money as already gone😂

Where's Mia Khalifa at now?
Tellin people to stay inside after 10 pm ain’t exactly a lockdown
[removed]
Yeah idk what to do
Starting to run out of steam at $50. Look at the 4hr chart for today and you will see it rejecting nearly 3 times off that level, once during premarket this morning, once this morning, and another rejection after hours today but with red futures. $50is their last real resistance point on the chart, but there is more support than resistance.

So I do think we will break $50. IMO any dip on DKNG at this point is a buying opportunity for a shorter term trade up to $55. I don't think we would go back up to $60 without back testing $50 first
I’ve hitched my wagon to the wrong horse

What about Mnuchin, specifically?
I went one day trade over my limite 2 weeks ago on ACB calls, recognized as pattern day trader now Im being cucked, Is there anyway this will be reversed like in 90 days or something(I use Robinhood like a retard). I also opened a Webull cash account and have no clue how to use it.
This is what keeps me up at night. If I didn’t cash out in March and reinvested the 30k I made, I’d be here. But then again who am I kidding, I could have lost it all.
HONEST OPINIONS, how’s PLTR lookin tmr???
He ded

Anyone else catch VEEV this morning?
BABA is way undervalued!! 😉
https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLS?p=TLS&.tsrc=fin-srch
Nah, just let it ride. That shit will fluctuate so much on the day to day you’ll just be too nervous and paper hand that shit. But sell at least 3-4 weeks out from expiry.
That cucks a walking pump and dump
Well fucking said.
I think i called it today tbh
i had a similar problem but I figured out how to get over it, here's what you do:

\- look at the correct chart, i.e. the daily chart

\- observe the trend you are betting with (just don't bet against trends, you don't have to convince every investor that there is a bullish or bearish trend: just convince yourself. take a straight edge and line it up with the chart, and identify the trend... don't bet against that shit)

the trend should be over a time period similar to your options expiration date

when the stock goes the other way, rest easy knowing that overwhelmingly they follow the current trend

occasionally you'll still lose, but you'll lose less if you follow the trend
What strike for gme?
ZM bulls, what strike and date are you getting and what's your exit plan. That IV on post earnings calls is scary, could easily get crushed.
even if that was true which it isnt, what would I do at mammoth? there's only two good chairs there 23 and cloud nine. At vail if you can ski down blacks, you essentially have 5 mammoths of mountain to ski down
The illusion of power is greater than actual power.

Fuck!
MODS!!
Or this is just where huge gains and losses are posted and praised. I'm sure there's plenty of people happily investing in index funds and PENN and posting about their 10% swings on twitter. 

Most retail investors don't regularly trade options, as much as this sub would lead you to believe.
AMD by open
😆
Also, prepay your estimated taxes or you'll get fined by the IRS. I learned the hard way. Fortunately it wasn't a lot that year.
Good job there
What are you holding? I got may DKNG cs
This one just broke out today so not sure if you'll see a pull back until it gets to 179-180 but if you can wait, around 166.50-167. Personally, I'd wait until closer to 146-147 which might not ever happen.
they usually follow us
From what I understand Canada and EU are just days away from a trade agreement, wonder if it will pave the way for selling them in the UK.

Nio, Hertz, PLTR, CIIC, essentially certified triple grade high volatility retard stocks.
Honestly you could even go for 270 strike and be fine. Those are pretty safe, maybe save some $ to average down if you get the chance. I still haven't gotten a clear bullish divergence signal on BABA though. Looks like the bottom is $260 because every time it dips below that it starts to charge back up to $260.

I think the bad news is priced in at this point, but in general China stocks are fairly susceptible to news moving the prices around
I’m gonna make a lot of money tomorrow, after close I’m gonna have dinner then about a half eight of mushrooms and some weed, about an hour I will realize money and stocks and power and this entire bullshit system isn’t even real. Monday I will go back to making money again.

Probably forever, when ev gets boring we will move on to delivery drones or robotics or something futurey, I don’t know? Look, I don’t make the rules, I just go along with whatever is popular. That’s the key to being a great investor, just copy whatever other people are doing and never think for yourself, because your probably an idiot. But don’t take my advice because I’m not a financial advisor, just a reckless gambler.

Options, on the other hand, are a zero-sum game, because options don't have a physical manifestation, they're contracts created by an agreement between buyer and seller. Whatever the buyer makes, the seller loses, or vice versa. That's not the case for equity, where there is an extant amount of equity representing the value of a company. If the company grows, the value of its equity grows, meaning the pie grows.
Based on the loss porn I’ve seen, I figured
Keep it on your watchlist, they do 12% of Nevadas pot sales from 1 location. I've held 5000 shares since IPO, I think it could pull a GRWG in the future and shoot from 4 to 25. It is for sure volatile enough to sell at open and buy back at close and make 2-5% most of the time. FSR and PLNHF always gets morning wood and waterfalls after 45 minutes.
In my investment club I hold NIO, TUP (up 25%$) and now AMZN and CIIC. Sold SPCE for 20% gain and yeah I’m currently first place outa thirty thanks to this thread lol

You can only claim a $3000 loss per year. You can carry forward the $47K loss. On the bright side, If you make $47K next year in stocks you will pay no taxes.
tbh usually waiting 5-10 minutes at least for prices to settle a little bit usually is in your favor
looking healthy and bullish on the chart, I am hoping that it will push up to $55, maaybe tomorrow if the market is green

Another example to illustrate--imagine a company with exactly 1 share worth $1, owned by investor A. Investor B shorts the company, and sells the share he doesn't own to investor C. The company's output doubles and so do their profits, and investor B is forced to cover by his brokerage, who sees the short share as too big a risk. In this case, B buys back the share from C for $2.  
Investor C has a realized profit of $1, B has a realized loss of $1, and investor A has an unrealized profit of $1.  
That means the total profit is $2 while the total loss is $1, "balancing the books" so that the outcome, in aggregate, is a $1 increase in people's total holdings, commensurate with the $1 price move of the company from $1 to $2.

It is! I do worry about this guy getting out of the position, especially because he is so public and if he starts to bail all the bandwagon hoppers will get off. Seriously banking on the squeeze
the market is looking at summer 2021 and seeing blue skies and everything 100% back to pre-covid life and levels. It sees airline, cruise, theatre, etc stock and how cheap it is right now and buys it expecting it get back to it's precovid activity.. And when you realize that, you begin to understand how fucking dumb this market is

Jk. If tomorrow is bullish this is like a 9/10 play
You probably are
They don't have it on DKNG.
Wrong lmao
Did they change the rules?
But there is a positive quantity of stocks, not 0. If there were 0 shares, implying that for every person long a company there is a corresponding person short the company by the same amount, then I would agree with you. However, companies have positive equity, not equity summing to 0, and companies become have historically become more valuable over time.  


The reason they become more valuable is essentially the existence of more money, and more money can exist without the value of money (what the money will buy you) decreasing because output and efficiency increase with new technologies, company innovations, etc.   


One farmer can produce a lot more today than in the past, meaning the price to produce one unit of crop is lower, and thus someone who invested in a farmer that produced less and now produces more will have a more valuable investment.  


The fundamental reason the market isn't a zero sum game is because economies become more productive and generate more value through growth.  


If we had a nuclear war, economies would shrink from the devastation, and the market would still not be a zero sum game, it would be a negative sum game.  


If we had a market with no growth in aggregate, then sure, it'd be a zero-sum game, but that isn't the case.
So you’re sayin there’s a chance
You’re going to need a miracle

PSA: BABA IV for options is less than 40%. Even a 3% move makes your options go supersonic.  
  
I am averaging down on GLD leaps if these retards finally agree to a stimulus (Feb? March? April? May?). GLD has been so beaten down and stagnant since August that the IV on my Dec 2021 leaps is 20%.
I see Halsey got the right plays to fund the operations.

Up to you and how much momentum you think it has, but if you look at FCEL’s charts the last week, it has always peaked before noon. If it’s late morning and above 5.75 I would probably sell. If it’s below that, you’re prolly not getting anything from selling, anyways.

The more people die everyday the higher the stock market goes. None of this makes any sense.. Over a million people have died from this virus and we are in a major recession.. They just announced a curfiew for the entire state of California.  Stock market is at all time highs.  I would love to see a 20 to 30 percent correction so I can buy.. I don't want to buy anything more then a day trade as we are at nose bleed levels here.

Coming from a startup robotic integrator which barely survived and got acquired, robotic integration profit margins are scissor lean. Biggest robotics manufacturers in the world, Fanuc, MITSUBISHI and even down to the Kukas and UR...the space is so saturated. All are working on the next Cobots. 
 Sadly UR and another small company in the Bay have the lead due to their logic system and the ease of teaching the bot the functions.

Thoughts on 19.5c 20c and 20.5c for PLTR 11/20?
Honestly it's just to see who read the material. It's been a while since I graduated but in law school 1L exams were like this. 

Lots of arcane and irrelevant torts.

Like for example if Chad hits Boomer with his car what are the claims. And there you were also supposed to add loss of consortium for Boomers wife. Those who wrote that did better than those who didn't.

Even though in real life LOC is just a kitchen sink claim that you include because it is relevant. No one brings a suit solely with that as their claim. And it's mostly just something to cya.

I sold spce at 21 like an idiot but I rode it from 17 and didn't want to ride it back down but I'm an idiot for selling.
you think its too late to go in now?

There is no right answer. Some people do before earnings, some people right after a big leap, some people just wait for expiry. I think it really depends on if you are planning to use that money on any additional positions.

Okay pokimane. We buying puts now or what?
If you sell for a profit you have generated a taxable event that you owe taxes on. If you subsequently lose everything and don't sell for a capital loss in that tax year then you'll end up owing taxes and not having any cash to pay them. You get what I mean?

Hellllll NO. I’m guessing that’s how you got here. Buy and hold. Both are undervalued and BTI has a 12-14% dividend. Trade options once you have a 5-20k safety net in anything else. (5-20 maybe 50k if you’ve got more than 1 kid and 2 dogs)

Hey boss, r/smallstreetbets will prolly be a better place for you to learn. They’ll teach you how to lose hundreds of dollars on poorly timed calls instead of tens of thousands. Then, next year, when you have $20k in newly acquired freshman year student loans to YOLO on deep OTM meme stonks you can come back here to play with the big boys. You have to walk before you can run.

$COTY will print.
Felt like the top was in today for FCEL and maybe even PLUG as well. It hit 6 this morning and within an hour it sold down to 5, before creeping back a bit. Was down AH too. I bailed today, because I didn't really feel comfortable with it. Some analyst also said that it's rallied too much and people should chill on the buying. Hard to say tho if it will sell off hard or hold tight for a while before trying to move back to 6. But yeah, it ain't hitting 7 tomorrow lol
Gonna add another 30 shares of BABA tomorrow fuck it mang

Haha I can 👍
I try to buy leaps in multiple quantities, and learned to pick them up in waves. So that I have the option of covering cost basis + profit. And cashing in on profits when they get large while still having some. 

I'm usually not that lucky where I have to decide on taking 500% but that also means you can write covered calls if you're confident on the company and are planning on exercising when the time comes.
Do you think I should get some options on those

This is true. ETrade for instance only allows up to Level 2 with a cash-only account.  I have one of each type of account there so cash work great for intraday trades most of the time, and if I want to do level 3, I use the margin account.

Yea, a crazy amount of open interest and volume. When you see it over a hundred thousand it's a pretty good indicator. Compared to zoom calls for like next summer you'll probably see some that have 200 contracts as open interest. NIO has 100,000 at 50. Should be able to see it on your trading app
I want big green or red so I can sell options. After that flat is great, green is good, red is fine

Nightcrawler it is. Much appreciated

gave you an inch and you took a mile.
You would be far better off doing basic option research on youtube but...

And option in its most simple form is the ability but not obligation to purchase a stock at a price at any point up until the end date of the contract (the expiration).

When I bought those retarded calls for next Friday, what I did was buy the ability to purchase PLTR for $25 a share at any point up until end of day next Friday.

That makes sense right?

Well the stock was around $17 a share when I bought the 50 call options and each call cost 15 cents each. But here is the kicker, an option represents a batch of 100 shares so you multiply the price by 100 so each cost $15 so $750 is what I paid in total (plus the broker fee).

Now a bunch of things can happen in the next week. For instance the market is closed next Thursday and closes at 1pm on Friday due to turkey day.

Lets say for some weird reason PLTR jumps $5 tomorrow to $24, well the likelyhood of my option being in the money went WAY up so much so that it will now be valued at roughly $1. I could then sell right then for roughly 6x my money and be done with it or...I could let it ride.

Lets say it hits $35 next Wednesday, will I would have the option to buy 50x100 shares at $25, I own that contract that grants me that ability. That contract is now worth $10 (35-25) of intrinsic real value and some extrinsic value lets say $2 more due to the crazy high IV spike so $12 per which is $1200 per. I have 50 of them and would sell them instantly on the open market for 60k making roughly 80x my original investment.

But what will most likely happen is the stock flops around and the value of the contracts do not go over 25 cents each and I end up riding them into the dirt where they finish their lives worth 0.

And that is the most basic option, a call. There is so much more to this than this brief recap that it fill books and people devote their careers to them.

Everybody already knows what to expect. We went through this less than a year ago. We had a massive freak out in March because NOBODY knew what was going to happen. I’m in Oregon. Gyms and restaurants are “shut down.” Nobody gives a shit. Everyone here is going about normal life (with a mask on.)

As long as it makes me rich, I don’t give a fuk.
Here's an example using your $5K:

RKT is a stock I became interested in because of this sub. It trades for around $21 to $22, but ought to get into the 30's over the next year. It seems to resist going below $20.

Instead of buying 200 shares at today's price, you could write 2 put contracts with a strike price (purchase price) of $19.5, good until 27 NOV 20. Today you would get 0.13 for each share, or $26 (minus commissions) for selling those 2 put options. Your options would be cash-secured because you have the funds in your account to execute the promise to buy 200 shares @ $19.50 ($3,900).

If RKT drops to $19.5 or lower, then on 27 NOV 20 you will buy 200 shares of RKT at that price. That is certainly better than buying the stock at today's price and watching it go down 1.75 points. Plus you keep the $26.

If RKT stays above $19.5, then at close of business 27 NOV 20, the 2 put option contracts expire worthless and you keep the $26. Then you do it again.

$26 return on the $3,900 you risked is 0.67%. Pretty good return for one week. That's about what you'd get from a bank in a year.

I've been doing this CSP (cash-secured put) play on RKT since mid October. I was assigned shares once, so I flipped and wrote a covered call, which was executed the following week at a profit. The premiums I've collected have averaged nearly 2% per week. It's a little lower now, but so what? I don't lose any sleep and I'm making money.

I will likely start buying shares of RKT to hold long term from these weekly premiums. This is a slower process, but much faster than savings accounts and not as risky as YOLOing.
Uh what you got to say Stalin?
Really does suck being a gay bear, just converted 2 days ago. When youre a bull, everyone goes along w any lie or faint whiff of hoping about hopes of stimulus. When youre a bear, people will ignore the fact the entire force behind this rally is being shut off. Hope something really gay happens overnight.
Bruh, why you buying weeklies when you have that much capital? Regardless, sorry man.
It's to reduce the amount of time people spend in crowded bars and clubs which are some of the most likely super spreader venues.
I’m low key pissed that TSLA is mooning. I’ve stayed away from it intentionally because I think it’s bubble pricing. I also own a shitload of SPY and VOO. Now it’s going to be absorbed into my ETFs at peak pricing, and no doubt the bubble will then pop, spraying its bag holding load over the entire world of conservative investors that own it unintentionally.

NIO 50c I bought last week for 25k worth about 4K rn 🤡
Right now they simply occupy two different points on the value chain. 

Nio has all experience shops right next to Gucci/Prada stores and is trying to replicate and surpass what Huawei accomplished against Samsung/Apple in the handset space. Their cars are not just taking aim at Teslas and EV-savvy millenials, they're grabbing sales numbers from BBA/Lexus and converting old money who had no interests in EVs. 

X has great aspirations and serious R&D, but their main products are competing at a price point a step below what Model 3 sells for in China. They're gonna be a serious mass production powerhouse for entry level consumers. Going above and beyond that though, nothing's easy.
lmao they started ramping it early this evening huh
6% day is all I need.
when the option expires and it's not at the strike price you lose it all. The open interest is basically how many contracts have been purchased. Volume is what's been purchased for that day. Open interest is cumulative. Basically means a lot of people have big bets on the price increasing

I agree with you but this market doesn’t give a fuck what you think bro

How do people grow the balls to yolo shit like this? I have trouble doing a 2k yolo

I feel so bad for all you people with a bunch of money making fun of this guy.
Gonna be green by open. Sorry bears but I’m just trying to save y’all some time/sleep so you don’t have to stay up all night watching futures slowly creep up towards green. If this were a true limit down or circuit breaker it would already be -2%. Now is just the inevitable melt up to green.
Had the same, rolled it over to some 500c 11/27
Bahahahah take my upvote well done

About $23.40 for me

In the long run Boeing is gonna be OK. Also, in the long run we’re all going to die.

If you could put 200K+ into one stock, I don't think you are stressing about missing these gains

Fuck you
Yeah I sold covered calls 1 week DTE that were 20% above market value and I'm kicking myself that I get to sell 100 shares for a 20% gain in a week plus the premium cause the stock went up 70% in a day. I'd probably have sold 100 shares at about that price point anyways as it was going up as that was the reason I sold the CC in the first place but I'm still kicking myself.

Second worst are the auto flush toilets that don't even have a flush button and just rely on motion sense of someone sitting down. You can't do a courtesy flush, and if someone before you leaves skidmarks or something you want to get rid of before sitting down, it's nearly impossible to get rid of.

A lil late on some stocks up 60% dont ya think?
I was expecting tonight to be more like the time when we went down -40 points at midnight and then proceeded to open slight green still
Wtf -1.9k? Try -350k pal. Then you can say youve gone for broke.

I hope some of your calls print bulls.

Bears, fuck your puts they're expiring worthless. I'll toss you 5 bucks to buy them back so I can sell you a different one for the next week.
I think selling wasnt that bad afterall
You think it’s a bubble, ok. That will burst in 4 months? Not likely.

Unless they announce their target and it isn’t Stripe, you’re gonna lose that money.

Anyone have an opinion on FedEx leaps? I feel like between holiday season and delivery of vaccine, they will print for the next year. I was looking at June 2021. Usually do monthlies so was looking looking for advice.

They’re gonna have more and more contracts with cities. Entire fleets of Arcimoto Cops, Arcimoto Firemen, Arcimoto Postmans, Arcimoto Foodies, Arcimoto Weed Delivery and so on. Okey normal people don’t want to drive this toy and want a real car, but professionally it’s more than interesting. They are scaling up production fast, will probably be the first ones to work with tsla tech, have the most efficient EV there is (thanks to form factor). Their CEO is a serious beta player : in other words he will easily work with many other companies without friction. Yeah today’s rise is crazy as shit and will pop before next month, but they might be a serious longterm EV play.
Time to sleep so I can see if these WSM calls print

That won’t happen until after the merger, the warrants are an incentive for investors to hold through the merger without sell dumping everything. Every 9 shares you buy you get 2 warrants after a certain amount of holding

I've been doing the same. We're gonna have one of those days were it spikes up early day, and dips at close. Hate when that happens
It does that every day silly bear. Wait till we green up to the moon tomorrow. When I pass ill share a dollar so you can eat tomorrow 😋
The stock market or wsb?

You think that. Basically everyone has been thinking that since Buffett got famous and QQQ took off while value investing died. SPY 500 will be a thing soon enough, and we won’t see SPY 350 again until COVID-23, WW4, or whatever shit comes along.
In this regards, I guess so. 

But you are correct that NIO’s market cap should be much larger than XPEV for the foreseeable future.

How many AMD calls do you have?
Monday can swing radically either way which is why Fridays are attractive for options.
Bonus tip: add in occlusives to lock that moisture in 👌
Maybe if they split which ain’t gonna happen.

Did you guys live together before you got married? 

I'm married to a Brazilian girl but we lived together for a year first. If you can make it through one year living together without problems then things will probably work out. If she's just in it for the money / green card she won't be able to fake it 24/7 for a year.

Yesterday behind the Wendy’s, I heard from a guy that knows a guy that knows a girl that knows another girl that they just had a baby. Tonight I’m eating baby arms 😋
Yeah you’ll get notified of the upcoming IPOs and their estimated price range. You can submit an indication of interest for a couple days and then based on total interest they’ll price the IPO and you’ll have one day to confirm you want to buy the shares at the confirmed IPO price or else you can bail out
Roblox is piece of shit BUY PUTS
I wish I spread my yolo money out more evenly but am super heavy BABA 262.5 calls

12/4 AMD 86 calls. 

Sold BLNK 15s for about 250% average return. Probably will churn higher tomorrow but needed to cash that in. 

SBE warrants are printing hard. Sadly I sold 500 of them last week to buy more TARA. But got into CIIC equity and warrants today

Hey, I’m transitioning here. Cut me some slack. If it makes you feel better, i’m also balls deep in some 12/4 PLTN 19C’s, but i feel great about those.

Yes there are a bunch of other funds that benchmark off of the S&P adding another potential 167m shares to be purchased.  

These funds aren't like SPY so they can choose to buy whenever.  As they're benchmarked to the index they need to outperform or at least equal it so the run up to inclusion will give them extra gainz if they buy prior.
🤡 gonna 🤡
I love how everyone on this sub has dreamed up this JPow vs. Mnuchin beef, when in reality, JPow has been giving speeches begging congress to give people stimulus for like 6 months straight now.

He probably called up Mnuchin and begged him to take it back.
Agreed. The concept is brilliant

I still think you're trolling me but in case you're not, this is what you should be visualising. The strike price of $20 has nothing to do whether PSTH goes up or down before 18 December. There is every chance a target is announced tomorrow and it shoots to $30.

I don't think you've bought the options yet otherwise you would've posted a screenshot, so there's hope for you yet.
