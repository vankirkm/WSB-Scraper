A good play as well, I'm a bit hesitant of weed stocks because the referendum in my country didn't pass and I got burned.
What’s up with the gme play....down considerably in the past week. Is the squeeze still on? Good time to buy in? Or is it all downhill from here?
I've seen gasoline delivery advertised already. 

Maybe you could bring back dedicated milk delivery. Millennials love vintage shit.
Well rn the ask is 33.50
Yea bears are definitely fuk because spy dropped over $20 within 1 week. You’re smart!
I'm 80% in Chinese stocks. Whatever happens they win.
those head and shoulders belong to Big Bear, and next the market is about to trace his penis
They are likely to be lower.
I’m going to give mine something really expensive she doesn’t need. Chemotherapy.

>I'm not kidding, if he cheats and prevails you will see riots never before seen in the US.

Look at mr tough guy over here lmaooooo
Thailand, can't think of a name. Just don't make the same mistake I did and hook up with a high profile mafia girl. That shit was fucking nuts. Showed me the dark side of the Thai underworld. Also don't worry about them ladyboys they're easy to spot for the most part. Live like a king with lil money and not as dangerous as mexico as long as you don't get involved with the mafia or police.
Bloomberg needs to cut it out with these sick kid commecials. Why would I donate when I can buy more calls?
Don’t think about it, it’s like betting your dad will ride your mom..
That's why you play both sides.

Stock split companies tend to lose value after their run up. AAPL 100 max EOY.
haha
 Germany isn't gonna announce a national lockdown or something, are they?
get out of here with your logic about market cap

apple was over $150 a share before the split and amzn is at $3k a share so apple must be over $1k a share
What about OIL, are you expecting any extreme reactions.
Hey guys don’t worry everything being priced in is already priced in... which is definitely priced in. ReLAx
Well sure, but I could list out a dozen things that make the future look really, really bleak for the western world.
Its my favorite of the solar stocks tbh
The S&P 500 (SPX) fell 0.04% between July 31 and October 31. That means the market forecasts -- by a hair -- that Joe Biden will win, according to CFRA Research's Presidential Predictor.
Wait what? Algos are pushing trillion $ stocks to fuck over a trader to make $70 of off a credit spread?
you'll get a cool prison tat, though
It is a very ballsy move to invest based on the election.  Can’t trust the polls as far as you can throw your laptop out of the hotel window...
Good as long as the CCP says so. If they want to dump you are SOL. IT is why Chinese love to invest in Europe and USA. They don't want the chinese shit.
The good news is we’ll all be billionaires. Bad news is that will be the cost of a normal trip to grocery store.
And needlessly killing thousands of people while the economy continues to be shit as people aren't interested or cannot go out isn't also negatively affecting the market? At least one side has an actual plan. Nobody wants a lockdown.
If there's a dip in solar prices sure, futures look decent tho so idk, it's your money do what you want. I've had solar power leaps for months and I don't really trade in weekly options.

Bruh not really. Literally just dye your hair pink, act gay, and yell fuck trump. Liberals will literally protect you and you can go shopping. 

Big brain moves
Depends how much the run is prior to that. I like the 35 call for next week tho. I might hold just cause of how much I love this play and what the upside could be
This is not even close to true
Trump not handling covid well is a bad take. 

All the states that needed supplies got them. New York got all the ventilators they needed. They got a hospital ship sent. 

Trump locked the borders down early and stopped flights.

What else did you want him to do?
Trump is a walking corpse.
Oregon just introduced a bill to decriminalize >1g Heroin, meth, >2g Cocaina, >12g shroom, and so forth...
Moving away from fossil fuels in the coming decades will inevitably happen no matter who gets elected.
Agreed, but I think it'll be flat, there's too much uncertainty for people

Hah, I hope it goes that way! I'll sell almost everything before I head into work if so.
I think only two scenarios happens a democrats blow out Trump or Biden wins moderately.
Something you bears don't understand. Election chaos, civil unrest, corona surging, mass deaths, lockdowns, BLM riots, Trump declaring himself ruler for life.. all that sh1t is already priced in.

Bro u know going thru what trump is putting is thru will make the economy take even longer to recover? Ppl are losing all their assets rn, ppl are getting into debt, people are not traveling here as much as before bec they don’t want to deal with the even dumber than usual Americans. Meanwhile 120k+ cases daily, and the people here are scared to spend their money bec their future is uncertain. 

A strict lockdown will push us past all of that and move the process along a lot faster.

I think the biggest damage caused during riots is done by people who doesn't give single care about politics. They just want to cause damage and this event is perfect for them, kind of riding on that hype of anger that will be just there.

**Also, it's 2020.**

I’m a little cautious about AAPL but I think April 135s are a safe bet but 150 still might happen

Thinking long term here, I’ll invest in any start up that manages to turn more mundane shit into a delivery based subscription model for no reason. It’s such a shitty business model that just keeps profiting bc consumers are retarded. I’ll just start my own company that delivers cans of gas weekly for a monthly subscription to “help save trips to the gas station with your busy millennial lifestyle!”. E-commerce is weird now

I agree, libs are blind and brainwashed
Have you been in a coma for 2 weeks?
Sniff
Coward
I agree that Democrats will likely challenge if it's even remotely close.

 But Trump is going to challenge no matter what. That's the entire reason he's been calling mail-in ballots fraudulent, to set the stage for his challenge. Also a big part of the reason Republicans had to confirm supreme court justice so fast, so they had that extra vote in the supreme court for the inevitable challenge. 

Trump also straight up refuses to say he would concede if he lost
Went cash gang on the 19th. Like Neo dodging bullets

So if the election is undecided after Tuesday, and one claims victory, how bad do we think the civil unrest gets? Like I genuinely have no idea if there actually is going to be riots.

If spy is 320 with all the shit going down, imagine once it's all cleared up. Spy 500 2022?
Most people are expecting more dip in the week(s) ahead. Most permutation/combination do favor a dip. The only combinations that may reverse that is a Trump win with Blue wave congress or possibly a Status Quo (Trump @ WH, Demo @ House and Repub @ Senate).
Now that's a flex
Regardless of how this election turns out, can we all agree that bear r fuk?

-Bears celebrate early and talk about rug pull.

-Futures recover and turn green.

-Bears say that futures don't matter. 

-It gets even greener.

-Bears disappear until next weekend.
Futures are becoming increasingly fake as the night goes on.
So is a robust V-shape economy
Biden = Renewables ⬆️ and possibly a crash more severe than march with no significant bounce back.

I don't know why you're talking about Bezos he's not running for president, bottom line is that Trump is a crook who utilizes every loophole and uses on-paper losses to his full advantage (even acknowledging he uses loopholes) then lies saying the $700 is a pre-tax filing fee 😂. Regarding the white supremacy questioning yea the proctor was definitely out to get him, but why did Trump hesitate so much, he could've just said they are bad but dodged it as best he could

I assume he thinks people will load up and buy guns while they can
There’s a website. Like wallstreetbetssentiment or something like that.
I feel like the uncles support trump but the younger crowd def leans towards the Democratic Party usually
The price
Experience: Turned $798 to $4128 in 1 month

Worst Day: Lost 30% ($1200~) this past Wednesday, made it all back from a day trade.

My SPY IC strategy is usually 1-2 DTE with a $20+ gap between the legs. So right now I have $312-$335 IC for tomorrow. It’s usually a $15-$18 credit if you buy it early enough but the risk is that there’s more time for SPY to reach either leg.
From the username it sounds like you'll put almost anything up your asshole. Are we talking coffee enema's or FD's here? Calls on SBUX it is I guess.

You seem new. So let me clarify. What tickr and what price points?
I just wanna make money
Yeah you’re right those two rogue right wing guys are the reason this is all happening and totally not the fault of the side that has an extensive history of violent protests. You forget most right leaning people are gainfully employed and don’t have time for your games.
This the best you got bulls?
Fuck elliott pollard and that bitch gallup

They fucking messed up
Biden does not have old white people ... have you never heard of The Villages - despite the fake news saying they are starting to support Biden, it’s pretty much a 24/7 Trumpfest of 100,000 old white retirees. Plus early voting suggests lower Democrat turn out compared to Republican (which should imply good results for Trump as Republicans vote in person in higher numbers) all the data does hinge on that fact you can only assume they voted with their party registration... that’s were the surprise could come from
NFC East is a joke bro
VIX calls until end of day Tuesday, VIX puts end of day Tuesday. VIX calls at open Wednesday.  


Easy tendies
Joe Biden is a LITERAL “representative of the people”

In the ‘90’s people were scared of crime. Ergo the crime Bill. 

In the early ‘00’s people were scared of the Middle East. Ergo the Iraq war. 

There was public support at the time for both of these.

Whats the best way to track the most talked about tickers?

Kinda similar to RobinTrack.  Isn't there something that tracks most mentioned stonks on WSB?
DXY cracked 94. Damn this is bearish af.
I’m saying it’s possible the effect the stock market outperforming during democrats could have other explanations besides better policy.

Maybe this effect is diminished if you changed when the year “begins” or ends. For example if Biden wins, some say there would be a sell off because of tax fears. So if the market tanks 50% between the election and inauguration of Biden, does that get recorded as losses assigned to republicans? Then after 8 years some charismatic tax cutter gets elected and stocks go up 100% between his election and inauguration. Is that stock run attributed to democrats?

(Im politically agnostic, lean left. I don’t even think stock market is a good report card. I’m just trying to make sense of what the data is measuring exactly)
Once I figure out what he is trying to say, I plan to inverse.

There were agent provocateur’s in Wisconsin, a off duty cop who was put on blast by his girlfriend. In Minneapolis, ivan hunter opened fire on the pd, he was a “boogaloo boi” so tell me more about how there are no republicans infiltrating these protests and escalating them in any facet.
Panda's are in the raccoon family actually.
They werent a bad thing? They were rioting against other Americans. If you have a problem with the government take it up with them, not your neighbors. you seem like you might be 15 so I’m leaving now

Yes. It's looking close enough that no matter who wins it's going to be challenged in the courts. (Although 10x more likely if Trump loses).  

Each side has a literal army of lawyers (talking thousands) ready to challenge the results. Trump has been setting the stage for a legal battle for months.  

If the results aren't a landslide it's going to be mayhem
You REALLY think Trump Is gonna get eight years? LOL

U do realize that vote was purely emotional for most people ? That if u didn’t vote yes on it ull most likely be labeled as a “Terriost” and voted out next term?

Yeah I don't have much in. I'm a little over 60% of my overall money, 10.2k in safe longterm investments: AAPL, MSFT, BA, SPY, and AMZN. I'm thinking of getting some first solar calls hoping Biden is going to win, but honestly I'm betting Trumpbis going to, although a Biden presidency would be better for everyone.

Thanks lol, I really just need it to crack below 3265 and it's game over. Won't panic unless it goes above 3280
I was interested, but my company recently phased out docusign, and it may still continue going up, but I think there is a lot of easy competition for me to feel comfortable with it.
We had a full week of red last week and you guys think it’s going down more, why? Because a president is gonna be announced? Makes no sense, the worst is behind us

Look up the Rockerfeller commission. The CIA has no problems with influencing American politics and spying on Americans. When a bunch of ex-CIA spooks say you should believe something with no evidence and CNN starts repeating it as gospel, do you not think that's suss?

And why do you think a President who hates unelected and unaccountable civil service power structures would have a problem with the CIA? Gee, I dunno.
U do realize the market looks to the future right? Pricing in the future? If Biden locks it down and I hope he does, it will help slow down the spread. People will get money they will spend said money. The vaccine should be coming out around March for everyone or whatever. But we need to get these cases down before the dark winter. And improving on green energy and giving subsidies for that, market will love that shit. U see how they pumping Ev’s and pumping Tesla solar and other solar stocks. Wake up dude.

Any validity in XSPA's Covid test accuracy? I feel like they're complete shit accuracy which is why the stock isn't doing anything despite the increase in Covid publicity/cases...
his covid response is bs because he knew beforehand how bad things couldve got but denounced it and only acknowledged after the market plummeted (big surprise)

regarding his tax returns he only paid $700 in federal taxes, he is currently being actively prosecuted by ny state for shady practices and will be charged when he leaves office, he is lying through his teeth when he goes on tv to defend himself

During the debate I don't know why he hesitated so hard to denounce white supremacy, it was literally so obvious he didn't want to do it live and instead focused on the PrOuD bOyS

‘We’re going in with our lawyers’: Trump admits plan to challenge election result as soon as polls close
Iraq stopped exporting last week due to an attack (maybe the Saudis?). There will be massive layoffs and a cut in production. Too many combustion vehicles. Planes and ships won’t be powered by lithium. Countries will literally go to war to drive up oil prices. We will have to watch and see, but I think the $50 number I presented is way too low.

Responsibilities are a bitch. I feel you.
Full disclosure. I'm not American I'm in Canada. 

I don't really care about his tax returns. 
When I think about his covid response. I try to think about what my PM did that was better. They keep celebrating Jutin in the news here and totally shitting on Trump, but Trump had a stronger covid policy IMO. 
What did they do differently? They all shut down at the same time. Canada had a weak ass response in comparison. Not stopping China flights. 

The proud boys issue is kinda dumb. They are not a racist orgnization, lots of minorities in there. Also he has denounced whte supremacy for years over and over again. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/10/10/supercut_president_trump_condemns_white_supremacy.html 

The fact that they keep asking him the same question is bullshit IMO. 

I don't know anything about his tax cuts though.
Was there anything bullish April through August?

If we had truly locked down in March and April, we could have been back to normal by may or June with the exception of mask wearing. This is what’s going to happen if Biden wins as well
Just lost my game because of that Eagles defensive TD. Fuckin wow
Good bot
Who ultimately wins in 3 or are we headed just straight for civil war II...lol (but not actually funny)? 

I think 2 is most likely with a delay on covid “cure” aka vaccine distributed to the masses by mid-2021 and we will see state mandated hot zone lockdowns through March 2021, but overall good economic health compare to European nations - Oh and riots for the sake of riots seem pretty standard these days ... thx for my $20k in SWBI that I bought at $6 lol
Don’t talk to her like that
I think you are too stupid for commenting here, can I get the government to regulate your posts? You're spreading some nonsense.
I'm not a wife yet, but gf of four years. I just went to san diego for a girls weekend without my bf and even when we went out for drinks, I got drunk and facetimed my bf all my drunk buys at target.

My positions don’t get fucked over by a quick pullback. Their all diagonal spreads so I have time to let theta work. Love the volatility though. Very fun.
My entire family had it, like mom dad sister grandparents the whole shabang. for the most part, (and it's been about two weeks since they've been cleared of it) still have a hard time putting the same energy into daily activities they used to before they were positive. My mom was in the hospital on oxygen with it, and she still has a hard time being able to go to work and to walk around/chat/perform work duties.

You keep saying riots like it's a bad thing. I think you keep forgetting why they are rioting. America wouldn't be America without riots.
Lower taxes, middle eastern peace deals, tough on illegal immigration, record low unemployment before China fucked the world, federal penalty for animal abusers, CBD and hemp legal, FOSTA/SESTA, reduced redundant regulation, Right-To-Try, kept open Guantanamo Bay, pulled out of the Iran Deal, Border wall.
Lol trump isn’t going to win by a long shot dude but ya I agree I’d he did there would be a ton of riots but the stock market tends to go up when there’s civil unrest. But it won’t matter cause trump isn’t going to win
Im buying more puts tomorrow, i won't be smooth talked by bulls
Brain fog is real and I didn’t understand it until I got it. Took twice as long to comprehend things at work. Luckily working from home means I work less and gamble more

I got into SWBI when they were $8, rode that shit to $28. I did not foresee them rocketing the way they did until after the fact. If shit gets volatile, SWBI is gonna moon. 

Note: I personally do not like SWBI's business practices when it comes to managing their stock specifically. They were AOBC, split the company into AOBC and SWBI, then 2 months later combined the two again to some degree, and then again later made the decision to include AOBC's business as a percentage of the SWBI option. Retard business dealing, so keep that in mind if you choose to invest.
I'll talk shit on the other side when I'm around either type of people but I'm not going to false praise anyone for shit
My gf dumped me because I told her I had a FTSE fetish
No, buy glass stocks if there are riots.
i had a nasty flu back in 09 or so that took 1.5 months for taste & smell to come back. i was getting depressed at one point i had a jar of really old multivitamins i would use to test and every day nothin. then one day i got a faint whif of stanky vitamins

I just want this election and the riots if the Don wins to be over.
Knowing this market its gonna be green when biden gets elected. Then in a week were gonna get circuit breakers because biden was elected and im not gonna have anymore money for puts😠
Scheduled maintenance. 🙄
If Biden wins im betting the market will go up a bit until Trump tries to fuck us all in the ass. Markets love stability. Biden would give stability while Trump has made the market look like fucking Six Flags
Oh I totally agree. I just wouldn't call this the bubble bursting.

Several black people were killed during these liberal riots. And wanna know who kills the most black people? It’s other black people. I don’t think we even need to talk about libs shutting down highways and harassing busses/cars..... cmon rioting is the left’s bread and butter. Can’t have your cake and eat it too— somebody has to take credit for shutting down the highways, rioting/looting, and harassing motorists. Sure some trump people drove around a Biden bus and a truck hit a car that was driving like a dipshit. That happened once. Left riots happened for MONTHS. Hell the Portland riots might still be going I don’t even know at this point.

You can get those shares by selling a cash secured put. Let's say that you have $6k. You couldn't buy 100 shares with that, but you can sell a TAN 11/6 60p for a credit of $110. If TAN drops below $60 (unlikely) you'll have to buy the shares at $60 and pocket the $110. If the price remains above $60, you will pocket the $110 and have a chance of selling another put. As you accumulate more cash you can raise the strike price to raise the put premium. At one point you will be forced to buy the stock (which is what you wanted) but you would have made a lot of money along the way. Your risk is if TAN rises significantly before you  get to own the stock. If you believe this is a strong possibility before 1/15/21, then you are better off waiting until your current call expires and making sure you have $5k in cash for assignment.
Cheers to that 🍻

You need to figure out what you stand to lose (iron condor has a defined risk), it depends on your strike prices, then make sure it's not bigger than 5% of your account. For an iron condor I would place my trade in the middle of previous high and previous low, so around 340 for SPY, when IV is high. Right now, price is pretty close to lower end (320) so a put credit spread would be my trade of choice.

I agree 1000%, and I think moderates on the left and right need to be careful to avoid labeling actions by the fringe as "my side" or "your side." That's how things escalate. 

I'm merely pointing out the difference for the purpose of predicting unrest, and thus for predicting what trades to make.

Check out CLAR. They own Sierra bullets the premier long distance target shooting round. Numero uno. 
In Feb they teamed up with true velocity to start producing ammo. Patents for ultra high performance long distance light weight rounds.

Oct, bought Barnes, the premier hunting bullet. They hold patents for some of the hardest hitting most accurate hunting rounds known to man. They also penetrate armor well.

True Velocity is a small advanced manufacturing facility. 
If CLAR buys them out you will see a government contract for special forces in the future.

Everyone thinks my username is a reference to being a soyboi but it’s “I am” in Spanish 😒
Get over it
Yes, and the article more or less takes the same position. 

>It's not clear what, if anything, that outlier could mean for Trump. The market is down over the past three months in large part because of a surge in coronavirus cases. 

The article is not saying this is foolproof. It is simply reporting that in the past this has been a reliable indicator of election results.

Guh, why would you say something like that?
Either way there will be riots. Police are already planning to have extra patrols roaming around. I think trump wins by a long shot though
Idk, I’ve seen some of those. I’ve also seen people who watch Maddow and think sleepy is actually gonna be president
You're selling your life - one day at a time
Not happening retard
I lost my yugioh card collection I remember it was worth at least 1k in 04 🤡
You have the itch, and it won't go away so easily, you will always think about it, I know your type, I know how you kids' are..

So let me end with this:

The next time you want to buy something ask yourself this:

Is some other Moron/idiot/retard/degenerate going to buy this option from me for more than what I just paid for this?

So in other words, you are thinking about buying a SPY 323 put tomorrow, and it costs $3.45.. ($345),  

- Is some other idiot on WSB going to pay more than $345 to buy it back from you when you try to sell it higher? 

Remember the market is about money and for someone to make money, Someone has to LOSE money..

So always ask yourself if you think before buying anything, will some other idiot dumber than you pay more for this than what you are paying right now..

(and the worst part is probably there is another person even dumber that would pay more for it..)

but still, stop thinking you can beat the market, you need to remember the market is filled with computers that instantly buy and sell at the blink of an eye on orders they have, and trust me, order books/order flows and more are all public.. 

I leave you with that.
Okay how many of those were right wing or trump supporters? And did you pull that statistic from your magic bag of statistics? or are you openly denying mass rioting and looting? Bc I’m pretty sure we all saw it
Yeah he needs the green pill

We’re following the same exact trend of every major bubble in US market history. Reach ATH, crash a little, reattempt ATH but don’t make it up as high, crash harder soon after. Only thing that could halt this crash is a stimulus. But then at that point it only delays the crash.
Well first off, you should probably sell instead of buy a 2% spread.

You literally couldn't ask on my comments, since I know you directly put this post here because of my comments man?? really??

I can already tell you 1 thing off the bat, do not sell 0-day credit spreads, the algo/market computers will quickly push/pull the stock to where you have to close out at a loss.. remember that orders are shown in the order book for anyone to see, and computers can instantly calculate what they need to do when they see some idiot order from WSB in the order book/flow ..

So that is your first lesson.

the 2nd lesson is to sell puts after bigger dips.. and sell calls after bigger rallies.

Give me a stock and I'll show you an example..
Keep in mind that the cheaper version of the new Xbox and Playstation will come without a disc drive for $300.  No need to go to GameStop when you can just download the games.

There’s a serious correction going on, prices were inflated - just look at the charts since March - and the 3 year - and that’s not a crash, is it? I’m not so sure about how we want to call whatever it is whatever it is. 

But there could be a crash, may be. Stim May be too late and there’s rent and eviction moratorium expiring, stacking unemployment and a lot of mid and small business will be out of business by March due to effects of this holiday season being tight spending wise.

Read the statement. I said recover like the last one. Meaning it won't recover in a few months. Also companies can stay flat. Also you are interpolating for data that you are extrapolating for. Degrees of uncertainty increase significantly. This is statistics 101. Very BASIC stuff. The US economy can turn into the next Japan's economy and stay stagnate. It is obvious the US is losing its world's dominance. Every empire had its fall.

Obviously everyone wants old election stuf from the 1920s and such but that's because they couldn't mass produce it at this scale. It's worth less if everyone has it.

Remember the last time there were riots and protests and looting? Every major American city was on fire, and the police were abandoning their posts?

The S&P went up 8%. Don’t be a pussy.

Hold on tight boys, it's gonna be a bumpy ride no matter who wins.
You’re so fucking shortsighted and also retarded. The kkk literally has 12 members. When your peaceful protests rolled through small business were destroyed. And those mega corporations that can afford to rebuild? Guess what normal people work there. When their store gets destroyed so does their job. If you think “they’re gonna be ight” then you clearly didn’t pay attention to what was happening. There were people of all different races crying in front of their destroyed businesses in downtown Atlanta. Fuck you this wasn’t about racism or social justice, it was about getting free shit and stealing


Edit: apparently condemning riots means you support the Kkk. Looks like the rest of Reddit has infiltrated wsb
This is truly must watch and mind blowing
Socialism and capitalism coexist. Republicans have brainwashed you. Europe is(overwhelmingly) a group of socialist nations.
You say that, but Biden has proposed a tax on guns (obviously unconstitutional, especially with the recent scotus appointment) and it’s not exactly cheap. It would ruin poor people living in rural areas all over the country, and people would be averse to buying guns if it’s even discussed by the legislature. In fact collectors would probably be scrambling to sell theirs, diluting the market further

Edit: read this if you want to know Biden’s official stance on guns (it’s not good for the industry, to say the least) https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/#
Just buy guns win win

It didn't burst at all. Let a little air out then promptly blew most of it back in
Talk with them and tell them how you feel and mention that you are going to work harder now and just realize that you have caused nothing but problems for them etc.. Have a talk with them about how this is your plan now, and mention the plan about how you will search and look for jobs that will save you money and you will try your best to work up the ladder in this corrupted world..

Ask them if they have any ideas for you and that you will be open to anything to help them out since you have caused them "distress" or whatever feelings..

Mention to them that you want to somehow pay them back by either working/helping them when you can..  

You can have the ole' "heart to heart" talk with them..

Basically you want to let them know you know you are stupid, and you are the type of person who had to totally fall off the tower and hit the ground to learn lessons.. and now you want to walk up the stairs one by one to get back up the tower.. 

But ofcourse you will be looking for ways to take an elevator up.. like the "work smarter" thing I mentioned... I think Amazon pays $20/hour for call center jobs? or some companies do.. I have to find the link.. 

anyway, open your mind, think/look for opportunities that will make money, like talking with everyone around you and/or looking for job boards and just literally networking.. 

It's about how you look/feel/smart/talk and give off the "I can work for you and make your life easier" vibe..


I'm sure this is getting too deep, but the idea is sit back for a second and think to yourself, "I am an able body person, and I can do anything from now on as I have no walls.. no stopping.. no mountain too high that I can't climb.."

You need to use the power of your soul.. which is oddly enough given strength without you doing anything right?? 

I won't get into it that deep, it's already deep enough, but just open your mind not to how you failed, but how you can PREVAIL, not fail... **PREVAIL**

Well.. considering the Supreme Court decides if Trumps case has any validity and stands first there's actually no need for Biden lawyers. I guess maybe preparing for after the fact? Although it blows my mind that people ACTUALLY think Trump can just decide to stay in the WH....
Bulls: Expect stocks to go up 365 days out of the year and think all calls = tendies

You’re technically correct but I promise you will have a much easier time by just not going bankrupt. Borrowing money will be a huge pain in the ass for years to come. Underwriters are weird fucks and a bankruptcy can rub them big time in the wrong direction and they’ll tell you to fuck off. If you already have the bankruptcy-sure it’s not the end of the world. If you think you might be headed down that path then Jesus fuck get off of it it’s not worth it

Matt Stone is a white rich libertarian that’s never lived a rough life. He’s not connected to the realities Americans face. Yea, his show is funny, but it’s not really that reflective of reality
I’m 26 and have about 130k all from money saved through work. Just last week I decided to buy 40k of Nio and 10k of pltr as a yolo in hopes that within the next 5 years one of these (more likely Nio if it isn’t another Chinese scam) will be worth 10x the amount and get me far ahead in life. So my advice is even if you have 100k saved by 25 still yolo because if not or if you lose it all regardless you’ll still have to end up working forever especially in this day and age for people our age.
No guns to buy. Everything is backed up until April

Thought I would start up my futures account after hearing all the new COVID-19 outbreak news. Worked really well through Feb-April as a lot of those moves happened overnight.

Currently down $400 on 14 contracts of /MES, who's with me?
i tried doing this with 1-3 dte and while it worked on days that spy moved, i ended up losing more on days that it was flat.

any particular reason you do 0 dte? my theory was that buying straddles with more time until expiration would prevent the losing option from going to 0.

I don't care what you think about the vector but she said that shit. You callin me a liar?
Not sure if you're serious with your comments or not.  Every financial part of your life is more expensive now and will be for 10 years.  Any type of loan you'll pay significantly higher rates than everyone else.  Insurance, way higher.  Want to rent somewhere else, nope, they won't take you.  New job, most do a credit check and won't hire you.  Literally every part of your financial life is worse.  You are the least qualified person to give financial advice in any capacity.
Point being is that you only mentioned trump as if he’s the only one willing to question election results. Both sides already openly stated that they are willing to test election results.
Did you mean to post in /r/Liberal? ..because you posted in WSB on a thread about betting odds..

Bankruptcy isn’t as easy as people think. It’s not a free pass. A judge will go through your financial behavior with a fine tooth comb and if they determine you simply lack the ability to manage your own money properly, you’re fucked.

You're overthinking it man. I just noticed a string of posts you made where you were calling everyone poor and saying we needed a WSB where only rich people could post.

So I tagged you to shitpost and rile you up. It's really nothing more or nothing less than that. Let's move on.
Trump promised new infrastructure spending, there is none for last 4 years.

Trump promised new healthcare plans/reforms, there is none for last 4 years.

Trump isnt interested in gov programs at all. He wants everything private. He cut the pandemic team and CDC budget before the pandemic. Hes trying to privatize k-12 schooling. You wanna drive on private toll roads too??

US main street economy is turning into a shithole economy. US has only been growing at 2-3%,  while the inflation is 2-3%, effectively making it next to 0% on average  for last 2-3 decades. Only growth was coming from population increase,  not actual efficiency in growth. China is consistently growing at 3-4%  AFTER inflation...theyre going to be kicking so many lazy inefficient  asses very soon.

[One of the foolproof measures of economy is velocity of money(](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)(you can clearly observe what happens when people dont spend money during COVID). [ Its been dropping since the 50s](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V) Why? [Because 90% of Americans have been getting poorer while the top 10% got richer since the 50s.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#range:1989.3,2020.2;quarter:123;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1,3,5,7;units:shares)  Rich people simply dont put the money back into the main street as the  bottom 90% do. Its locked away in stocks and financial instruments.  Consumer spending is 70% of the economy. If you make 90% of your  consumers poorer, you shouldn't be surprised with the results.

Scapegoating this on blacks, mexicans, chinese or any other ethnicity wont solve shit for republicans and Trump.

This website is manipulated to no end at this point. They have teams of Indians on this shit now. The election result is totally obvious.
What’s blowing my mind is the long term doom Bear sentiments that when DD’d literally have not a dang thing to do with the potential destructive forces in the national marketplace. 

The election matters but not that much. Covid yeah it matters but not that much. What matters is that the USA is a economy propped up by mid level consumers; and they’re all running out of savings and in debt, and about to be evicted, and that many businesses are propped up by consumer sentiment through Nov-Jan e Dru year. 

Even being simple headed about it and just looking at that gives us a barometer to (edit) “mid” (like a year or two) term bear - but short term we will get stimulus and make bank on market volatility. 

Quit thinking about this like a smooth brain football game or whatever your uncle taught you life is with his hand on your shoulder. Let’s make money dudes and chicks. Let’s make lots of money.

Pelosi also said that the only way trump would win is if he cheats and was ready take legal action plus a possible second BS impeachment.
Agreed, but is it too late?
Yep, was going to post it but basically scummy banks might not give you a loan but fuck em, there are places around every corner.  And 10 years it never happened.

Housing requirement loans
2 years after discharge  FHA
3 years for USDA
4 years for conventional.
8 years to reapply.

Guess what? FHA loans can be refinanced to conventional loans, your fat as is still in a house at 3.5% down payment. vs 3% minimum convenientional.

I doubt anyone filing can afford 20% down which is whats recommended for convenientional to get rid of PMI.  So your going to have to refinance anyway unless ur a boomer with oil money.

Still see zero down side.

Damn, I need a win tomorrow and the whole week. Last week was pretty awful for all us bulls. Holding SQ and ROKU for earnings. Hopefully the 🌈🐻 don't maul me to death.
Anyone else hear about NIO news announcing their European expansion  in 2021??? Dude from my stock chat mentioned it.

It was never like this..I honestly have no clue how it changed. Or when...complete 180 to what it use to be
I know there’s lots of bulls here but... anyone have any ideas when/how much everything will drop tomorrow?
For every winner there’s a loser who needs to win it back.

#exactly so that is why WSB will one day listen and sell credit call spreads which make you money in a "down trending" market.

- When you sell Credit call spreads, the stock has to rise above the strike you sell or else you make the premium as the option expires worthless..

random example : sell the SPY $345 calls and buy the SPY $347 calls like that..

You have to customize the strikes to find the deal you like.
Down bad on V... bought in at 212
Lost. Lmao
Everyone expects something, but at the same time people think we cant crash cuz we already did right? And thats exactly why we will crash, its so expected its unexpected. Spy 260p 11/20. Dont forget to diamond hand till expiry for maximum gains
Getting back in ICLN and TAN Mon. No way Trump wins.
Well...listen here...I'm not intelligence expert - I barely can spell the word. But, when an Intelligence officer is saying that a president is compromised...that is odd - its super fucking sus. Now when several prominent intelligence officers and agencies come to the conclusion...they're probably on to something. But thats just me. When a 4 Star General is telling the American people that something is not right. It just doesn't sit well with me. Now I know that the CIA, FBI, DIA, DOD and every other major intelligence providing agency aren't the most credible people, They do plenty of sketchy shit. But why the fuck would they all be against the president?

Just remember that if we lived in a world where there was no money there would be no chintzy money clips.
Ah smart. Okay so my 1k portfolio should be enough to drag the market down right?
Finally someone with a brain. Gun stocks are old fucking news, most people who were even slightly on the fence bought guns in March and April..... you couldn’t even buy guns on some popular websites at that time; “due to unexpected increase in order volume, we are no longer accepting new orders”

Now I know most of you retards weren’t around 6 months ago, so let me catch you up. There was a huge market crash and a lot of people were buying guns thinking shit would get crazy.

Even my parents who were entirely against guns through my entire life bought one. That’s how I knew when to buy.

Yea i think the problem for me is that I really want 100 shares of TAN. When I bought the call I didn't have enough money for those 100 shares. Right now, I still don't have enough buying power but I'm saving up for 100 shares. I just want to know the best way of acquiring those 100 shares the most affordable way without having much capital
so your solution is trumps plan? - continue to cut and ridicule scientists and hope for the best?

Donald Trump already said they will fight the results.
So many stocks were bought last week at record breaking levels. Biggest prints of all time. Billions at a time. They're not selling off anytime soon.
-Real Talk 

(since all the rest of WSB will try to joke with you.)

Build wealth in a different way, do not use the market right now. You need wealth to make more wealth, as you probably know.

So your "options" left are basically to take odd jobs and work manual hard labor to get money.. unless you are smart and can think of things to make money that don't cause you to work "hard".

When I say "hard" work, I mean stuff like landscaping/construction/building/helping those kinds of manual labor jobs.

For example, a guy near my street has a landscaping business, he has so much work and etc, but he can't find the "minions" to hire that will fulfill his demands.. etc..

the "idea" on working "smart" would be : Figure out how you can make something "web sites" from home, or work the phone from home (call center jobs) etc.. and then save that way.. etc..

In general, yes, don't give up and file for bankruptcy if you have to if it will "help" your situation.. 

also think of ways for making money in different ways other than "gambling" right now.

The best thing you can do is wait for the "correction" sell off' or Crash/recession incoming in the next year or two and then buy Apple sub $100/share, SPXL when it gets down below $40.. TQQQ under $100 etc..  

stuff like that and hold for 5 years for the next tech boom etc..

Buy tesla when it reaches $300 etc.. 

How do I know it will reach $300? because I sold credit puts at Strike $332 and lower, so I know the market snipers will try to get my money and drop Tesla lower so I have to close at a loss.. Remember, when you sell credit puts or calls, you win if the stock doesn't go below the strike if you sell puts, or above the strike if you sell calls etc..


God Bless and Good luck and always just remember you are just trying to make money and live peacefully.. it's not that bad.. life is filled with people that can't walk/talk/see/even born without arms and more, and you just have "money" problems... so think about that..
It’s bots all the way down
Flat tomorrow
Ok, JP Morgan, you’ve been found guilty of this already.  Time to find a new strategy
If you are afraid of a 0.2% transactional tax, then you are shittier as t this game than most.

The benefit of the tax would be that it fucks the high-frequency traders more, and will give them a bit less of an advantage when fucking the rest of us over.

Sold a bunch of shares so I could afford Tesla calls on the dip Friday. Bought in down 3 percent lost a good amount. Now I'm bagholding 6K worth of 11/6 and 11/13 395 calls.
Okay so honestly could someone or something with a large enough bankroll manipulate futures by placing enough calls and then cancel them before they would actually be purchased tricking other people into buying calls while they then switch to puts and fuck everyone else

Each state has laws regarding how much of your property equity is exempt. If you have no equity, of course you're losing it. But if you have equity, you will get to keep it up to a certain amount, sometimes it falls under wildcard exemptions, but typically numbers in tens of thousands and even 6 figures in some states.

You made the first insult. You then created points that are commonly used to scare people into thinking that the government is after your weapons - and that the average person will get screwed over from the new tax plan. 

You rebutted but did not mention nepotism again (which shows that you also think its a moot point)

You did not mention the point I made about guns. 

You then also sidestepped the tax issue by throwing a blanket term saying it will effect even people who don't make over 400k. 

A Nobel Peace prize Laurette in economics thinks that the tax plan would actually benefit the US and Quality of life of Americans. But you know economics more than him I guess. 

Its as if you have no real independent basis and are just spewing what people tell you to spew. Next you'll talk about riots and looting while omitting the fact that most persons arrested during the riots we've ween this year were actually trump supporters - 

Finally you have not brought up the pandemic. Which Trump alone has failed harder than any other president on the planet.

Seems like you have no original point - and can really not defend Trump on his policies or personal character.

The man should be in jail. He will go down as the worst president in history - and you are voting for him. Your children will be embarrassed that you voted for him in 50-60 years when we look back on this.
Fuckin agreed. It’s gonna be next week before we have a clear winner and mango is gonna tweet the craziest shit in the meantime. We in the red until trump is declared the winner

what if i want it to REALLY hurt?
You're better off selling the option if you're not close to expiration, because you give up the time value when you exercise. Say you have a 20C, stock price is at 30. Your ITM option might be worth 15$ on the market because of time to expiration (5$ time value). So you could make 15$ selling it instead of exercizing for 10$. Also, holding the option frees up the capital that you would need to buy the shares. You can earn a return on this capital, so there's an opportunity cost to exercising as well. The closer you get to expiration, the less you lose by exercising.
Bro imagine he loses and won’t leave the White House till he’s forced to capitulate by the staff only feeding him vegetables instead of Big Macs.

It would be a fitting end to the saga
I'd like to see a free speech alternative that isn't chan.
FAR OTM. Might as well just buy shares if you’re buying ITM
Maybe 10 years before you can file bankruptcy again, idk I’m not a bankruptcy lawyer. You have to wait 4-7 years to be eligible for conforming home loan that you’re not getting fucked on. Damn you’re short sighted.... and also ineligible for a litany of different home loans and refinancing options.  But as a broke retard I’m sure you knew that

Not to mention every bank you apply for a loan with will see that and make note of it. Just because it hasn’t effected your life yet doesn’t mean there aren’t any consequences lmao. And I would never do this, but plenty of LO’s send bankruptcies to the bottom of the app pile

Not trying to be political, just think it’s funny: When I first got hired as an analyst at the CIA, a few weeks later Biden came to address the staff in a corny Federal morale move. I went to his address (why not?), and it was not what I expected at all. He was so casual. He told stories about his dad and recited Irish poems from memory. The highlight, though, was when he said, “You know why I like visiting you guys? No fucking press.” It brought the house down.

Of course when I got back to my office my management educated me on how Biden hated the IC and that was a show. Oh well.

Beautiful imagery sir.
I usually buy at least 1 month out & have still lost plenty on puts. 

It absolutely makes sense that there should be some pullback after a stock keeps making new ATHs, but you really need to wait for confirmation. I’ve seen way too many people on this sub (myself included!) buy puts after a crazy ER move up only to see it keep going higher for days/weeks.

By the time it finally starts to dip your put is so far OTM even a 5% drop only brings you back to maybe -50% loss.
At least it’s not boring, I guess

P.S. I just want to clarify, I'm not taking out a 35k loan, that's just the pre-approved amount. Will probably pay cash and finance like 5k and pay it off in a year to build credit

Its not about the government doing the thinking for you. Its about them intervening when people are too stupid to protect their own interest.

If the government never stepped in and let tobacco companies continue to lie, advertise tobacco to children, not mandate seat belts and other basic safety measures into products millions of more people would be dead. Do you think the government at least in these examples should intervene? Or should they just let its people continue to do as they please?

edit: there are thousands of examples of government interventions that we take for granted. Some are ridiculous. Some are very necessary.

And no one is taking anyones fucking guns. you have literally bought the bullshit. The NRA loves people like you. Guns become a hot point, the NRA releases a article saying "THEYRE COMING FOR YOUR GUNZZ" then you people go out and buy 10 more. lmao. 

If you have some facts that are worthy of mention let me know.
bro this girl asked me on Hinge if I vote for Trump then she won’t fuck. We did fuck like kangaroos after I told her I only support Erdogan😆😆

Great.  Lot of people hyped up about the “blue wave”.  But few people understand that a simple majority just isn’t enough to get anything done with the modern filibuster rules.  You need the super majority (60+) to really push an agenda through.  

Failing that, the Dems are just going to get another lesson in how obstructive Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans can be.  

So now the odds of taking the super majority, please?

Actually, in bankruptcy courts, there have been cases where people did this, and a lot of the judges ruled they couldn't discharge this debt (since it was pretty obvious what they were doing).

Its also a myth that student debt is non dischargeable in bankruptcy court. Theres a lot of exceptions depending on your circumstances.
They could be a good short term play if trump wins and there are riots.

Look at $SWBI & $RGR June through July.

People seem to expect the government to do all the thinking for them. Isn't that essentially the government running your life?

Not sure how many times I've seen the government being blamed for covid spread. I'm not a health scientist, but I dont think the government is telling people to throw raging beach parties. People are still going out, and that's their problem. The individuals need to start accepting responsibility for what they do.
teladoc syndrome?
If you put the order in now you'll be automatically filled at the price from exactly 365 days ago. Not sure why more people don't do this. It's literally free money.

It's not that well known I guess, only weird part is you have to set the bid to 5000% higher than the ask for the trick to work.

It's hard to root for puts to win though if the backbone of your account is indexed or holding shares, because then youre still losing elsewhere.  That's the reason why I think.

Also when everything is constantly going up you don't have to worry about timing as much, you just keep winning.  There is a realistic bottom going down but sky's the limit going up.

Reason for it is increased certainty of landslide Biden win and less chance of contestion from Trump.
Raisins are Top Tier worst inventions ever. Now Craisans - those are divine
According to Fivethirtyeight, Democrats have a 90% of winning exec and an 80% chance of taking the Senate, a lot easier if Biden wins because they need 50 seats vs 51 if Republicans win.

Don't bet against spy...
It's now cheaper to produce energy from solar and offshore wind than from oil/natural gas. The price of PV cells are decreasing at a faster rate than predicted and continue to fall every year. Meaning not only is PV solar currently cheaper on a utility scale, it continues to drop in price every year. Renewables are not without their own challenges, however there are some excellent solutions, like a smart US nationwide grid. Energy storage solutions are not currently up to the task of delivering reliable energy during peak hours, so the demand for oil will still be there, but it should decreases every year.


I do agree that their valuations might not make complete sense, but you have to remember that the market is forward looking. 

Things that are scaring the market:

1. a possible carbon tax 
2. plummeting price of renewables
3. technological advances in energy storage & increasing energy storage capacity. 

All these oil companies might end up being a giant value trap for investors.

The real question is what long term investor is going to invest in XOM/CVX when they can invest in what is clearly the future, TAN/LIT.

edit: I forgot to respond to some of your other points. No one gives a shit about fracking except low information voters. Fracking is not even economically viable, go find me a fracking company that is still in business and has not filled BK in the last 3 years. 

I think your underlying assumptions about the oil price war are incorrect. It's just as likely and reasonable to assume that S.A. is lowing prices to unload as much of their oil reserves as possible before the inevitable switch to alternative energy sources (maybe they just see the writing on the wall before everyone else).
Tueaday/Wednesday.  Whenever we get election results i would assume
That 325 was an example . If we assume spy opens flat at 327 those spy calls and puts that expire tomorrow will open with a value in the low 100 dollar range. Robinhood does not let you see 0 day options. Robinhood closest date is Wednesday the 4th. Spy and SPX can trade 0 day on Monday Wednesday and Friday.

Get professional pictures taken. 

I found this dude doing photo tours in my city on airbnb. It was fun a group of us going around downtown and he snapped pictures of us individually in front of landmarks and shit all for $50. I swear to god those pictures helped me get laid more than anything else.

Your version is slightly true but omits very important information. But I won't explain it to you. my point was not to argue. 

Donald Trump has committed treason and did in fact work without outside foreign entities to win 2016. - This is Treason

Donald trump is aware of bounties on American Soldiers. He still thinks Putin is cool. - This is Treason

The CIA and FBI and every major Intelligence senior on the record testified that it is very likely that Trump is a compromised party. 

Sure, it could just be political propaganda - but i'm gonna believe the guys who have made these functions their lives.

This is not a witch hunt.

It did not occur under Obama 

It did not occur under Bush

It did not occur Under clinton

It did not occur under bush Sr.

Nothing like this has ever occurred in the history of the U.S. 

Is this gonna change anything? No. you can buy all the bullshit you're being sold, but this is not a normal, ordinary election cycle or president.
Ban for not posting positions!
Yes, but SPY 350 EOW, gotta ride the wave this week

What an amazing opportunity to sell options. So glad I jumped in. Insanely OTM junk paid well
Dm me I got a put I can sell you on the low
Weekend indexes dont mean anything... holy shit
You can only lose what you pay for the call
Hilarious all this chatter about futes 1%, give-or-take. Lots of surprises in store this week. Hold cash, be ready to move quickly.
How do I buy VOO on margin???
Post your girls IG, it's for an experiment to better our nation.
Damn I should sell some
take it and like it or else.
I’m asleep at 3am. Someone message me & lmk if I’m going broke or nah
We already know, not important.
Anybody else playing SEDG earnings tomorrow?
Nice. I sold some tqqq 100p friday right before that weird spike, I want to dump them for 30% profit and I’ll go back to cash gang, wont care much either way till after election.

Puts seems more logical to me in this situation honestly
JPOW will announce that you guys are gay idiots and the Fed will dump everything so you can suck it!
Hope so. It's just higher lows at this point
Gold at an ATH, Silver isn't even close
For sure! Or I could’ve just said “there’s reason to believe this election will be contested”
Algos are smarter now and I’m pretty sure we didn’t have circuit breakers back then.

You know it.
Spy premiums for weekly 300p still a couple hundred per contract. Iv crush on Tuesday
I’ve always wanted to visit, it seems they would be welcoming. Japanese beer is very good, I concur.
If AMZN goes below 3000 I’m not going anywhere near calls are you kidding??
Lol if that happens there will be insane riots all over the country. So puts
yes, considering the cost of living and inflation. Holding cash for a couple weeks or months won’t devalue too much.
can’t believe my puts won’t print. gREEn futures
I'm hoping for it to be bearish tomorrow, but as long as oil keeps up this trajectory I should be pretty stable. For what it's worth I'm gambling $100 plus or minus ten and seeing how far I can take it. So I'm going bearish on SPY and bearish on GUSH.
You’re literally retarded if you didn’t buy Apple or Amazon leaps Friday.
Looks green tho
Bears just cover ur eyes don’t watch anymore
Facts
based
LMFAOO all these retards gonna get bull trapped once again. If you fall for it again you shouldn’t be allowed to trade ever. Fuckin spy 300 tomorrow
Thank you, it’s unpatriotic to not adapt to the fullest
Bro, this is stock autist meets are you smarter than a 5th grader....
Tennessee legalized sports gambling today and I've been seeing Draft Kings ads EVERYWHERE. $1000c DKNG 11/2
Maybe like kickboxing or LA fitness. They have classes you can sign up for for free similar to orange theory
Hahaha why is everyone saying tomorrow green? You said that Thursday and look what happened. Let’s get a reality check. Election Tuesday, England closed this week for the next couple months. Covid on the rise and US will shut down(it’s not up to the president, it’s the governors). Circuit breakers are imminent
ELI5: MONEY PRINTER GO BRRRRRRR
Because smart people don't exercise early. Have you thought about doing the math on that? Please think

1. TAN is currently $68.77
2. A call contract 1/15/2020 $50C is...let say $20
3. Exercising early means you have to pay $70 per share.

Theta is priced in. You are essentially wasting away theta.

🥭
No such thing... Limit up circuit breaker for VIX!
Why is SLV up so much and gold is only up a little
Feeling pretty good about these 11/20 $24c
Did you buy these a long time ago and that is why you have been holding? Certainly you didn’t buy them in the last month or so. Time is security. No real reason the exercise the options yet. Sell the options and buy something else and go for the big gains.
It’s gonna be sunny the whole week
Knew I shouldn’t have gone balls deep in puts on Friday. Fkkkkkkkkkkkk.
Double negative. Couldn’t you just have said, “there’s no reason not to believe this election won’t not be contested”?
Where you been past 3 weeks of red? We already plunged.
Unlike UK, US is actually not scared of that kind of bullshit. We moon tomorrow🚀

Lol notice the man who went bankrupt is holding puts. Buy calls
I hope it stays just under $35, I sold $35 Friday covered calls

Anyone else like waking up to those 3 buttholes talking shit on CNBC before market open? Yeah I didn’t think so.
April to Aug was a v shaped recovery. Been two months since spy hit its ath and at - 10% since then. Might not be a limit down type of dump but definitely far from over..
Look up the Coolidge effect. Of course, it’s only a problem if you have options in the first place. But it’s a sacrifice you make. A good marriage > new pussy in my opinion. But no need to settle down early if you’re a young man.
Whenever cultures invade and conquer another they absorb some of the prior culture. I wish instead of weird state names we called each other flys with eagles and shit instead of Tom. Ok enough drunk shitposting. 

SPY 11/6 340c
Nope. Dump on idiots.
Agreed.  I read what you said and it’s logical.  Everyone’s response to you was insane.
China reversed to big red, Hang Seng giving up a ton of gains and looking to draw down red, EU futures in the absolute gutter. VXX green as far as the eye can see. Going to be an absolute bloodbath
Ah yes doctors are notorious for being underpaid

I’ve been averaging into SIL leaps. Down pretty heavy so far
Lol this shit is green fuck yeah.
Donald's lawyers already are ready to fight the results!
Autist. But current atm strike is 6.40-7.00. Where or when do you see spy at $240 for a straddle?
Well. Markets may be expecting a big recovery either way here.  That or futures fall 300 points any moment.
Bad bot
I take back what I said about slv
Just remember that the Europoors begin dumping at 3:00 a.m.
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch bulls
Late 2022, widespread administration by mid 2023.
Doesn’t going cash gang mean that the value of your money also goes down?
you see it every time we were like .6% green by 9 pm and then opened red
Agreed!
Nah friend it’ll be flat and it’ll end flat. Just a lot of algos trading in between

Check out how correlated price movement in SPY and daq futures are. Do any of you guys know how to setup a chart to view expected movement breaches?

Wow, you really don't know how this works, lol.

You can pump futures with a few mil, easy, because it's super low volume. 

It's 100% worth doing to then offload your positions, which could be tens or hundreds of millions. 

This is hedge funds 101 bro.
Selling calls tomorrow and buying YOLO puts at 3:50 the market is going to dip this week no matter who becomes president.
There’s also this company that does Japanese whisky, it’s splendid. Just always surprised me for how smooth Sapporo is, you forget how quickly you’re getting drunk.

Everyone in my groups are cash gang Rn. Also futures are not that green. Calls are fucked get over it cucks
I was watching futures before first glass of rum. Easy solution.
Because they will sell off expecting it lol
Lol
Relax, that definitely is what happens.
Open red and recover rest of the day
Might as well press 1111 right? Why go thru the trouble of making is a nice round number and add a zero haha!? They are already deciding to stop pressing the 9 sooner and continue with one last zero for some reason
Maybe pricing in a Biden win. Or pricing in civil war. 

Kinda weird saying that and not being 100% sarcastic.

I can't really discern your tone - but the government has failed to protect its people. People were predicting how data would be used to literally brain wash people, many years ago.  But somehow, here we are.  They should have intervened much earlier on when they saw how data was being used to manipulate people en masse.

Honest question. Why are people with $50k to blow using RH?

A great deal of volume on the buy side comes from large funds using futes to hedge their short positions. If multiple firms do this at once you can get some serious fake pumps

I think that’s a good bet, even with a Trump win I don’t see this dropping. I think the biggest risk here is some sort of election shenanigans that takes the whole market down.
I hope Biden wins just so Trump won't be around to boost Twitter's traffic anymore and it finally dies. Shit company with shit morals.

Open green with a big dump for about an hour after and recovery for the rest of the day. Then it will go up for the mid to long term when Trump gets reelected.
Nope

Maybe if your wife was never into you in the first place. The Coolidge Effect is a bigger problem in my opinion.
Ummm thats not how that went. Try again.
None. Americans are already fed up with this pandemic and there would be riots in the street if we locked down again. This time though small business owners would be leading the charge.

so basically both sides said if they lose then they will contest it? lmao.
We know they going to wait till the fear subsides in the morning then bring out the red hammer.
Good vibes on this one
Let's go with whilst
Certainly plenty of people long to see SNAP decline plus they missed out on PINS, no doubt they will try to push it to a more favorable entry. Also fan of both so I want a better entry too ☺️

Isn’t the market going to be messed up now since the religious conservatives did daylight savings but everybody else is still regular time?
Yes please
Exactly. They know this yet they dumped. You are contradicting yourself. The market prices required more and more stimulus. Just because there is stimulus doesn't mean the stocks will continue to go up. The Japanese economy is a perfect example of the government propping up the stock market failing.
Greedy fucker!  Good luck 😁

How could you possibly think that social instability and a global uncertainty won't drive down the market even if some emty suits have priced it into their spreadsheets? They price it in as a probability, likely less than 20%, so if it happens any dip will be magnified in addition to whatever irrational market behavior follows.

My God, you can't be this stupid. You're listing jobs that cannot be had if you have school genius. I can see it now, wake up at dawn to make it to the jobsite, work with your journeyman, leave two hours later to go to school, put in a full day, return to jobsite, finish assigned duties, go home, eat, shower, do homework, sleep wakeup and do it all over again. You have to be 18 to work for Amazon and other warehouses as well. My point here, is that you obviously have no idea what you're talking about. So please stop.

Don’t look at current prices. I buy them the day of. At open price is between 1-1.40. Used to be 70 bucks for put and 100 bucks for call but I’ve had spiked. I only worry about iv when a reversal happens after a 1.5-2 dollar rise.

As for stroke prices, most of them were in the money at purchase. Save one Microsoft call and one pltr call.

Weekly support at $319.80. If it breaks, look at the volume. Bears need high volume and follow through to prove it. In this scenario, we would then be looking for a Monthly Higher Low compared to $218.21 (the March low).

If weekly support holds, we need to see an Hourly higher low and higher high to start a   
potential daily trend change.

How the whole market moves will no doubt have impact, but PYPL specifically already sold off heavily with the market last week and then Friday it bounced from trendline support.  That plus excellent earnings = should be green.

Hi. I'm from the future.

This message is only for exactly one of you. I know you're reading this because I'm from the future. 

Don't believe me? You still haven't finished the dishes, you've already jerked off, and just laying on the bed, scrolling there, in those sheets you should've washed this weekend. 

You bought a LOT of those SPY calls before the pump, profited, held, and you're excited for tomorrow. I know you know that you're probably a little over leveraged. It's not enough money to ruin your life, but fuck is it gonna hurt if you lost it all, especially if you lose your job. 

**Sell your position within the first 30 minutes of market open. It will be the best opportunity you get.**

If you don't, then you will continue on my timeline's rail ways...and it ends abruptly if you catch my drift. 

I know you know I know. 

I hope you listen.

Will the mass suicides reduce the risk of rolling blackouts of the power grid because everyone will ne at home using it?  I don't want to freeze to death because everyone is at home trying to stay warm by running their furnaces.

I’ll just put my money into bullets and toilet paper in preparation for the chaos that follows that dump.

Starting at minimum is a crime committed by your parents. Anyone with two brain cells should be able to guide a young professional to a job that pays AT LEAST 13 an hour. You could be a plumber apprentice, mow lawns, work at amazon, or any warehouse for that matter. I think wal mart mass hires and starts at 16?
Hope you’ve been enjoying your little gay meals  bears because they won’t last long, you’re going to get fucked to death when stimmy surprisingly passes one day.
it's the perfect asymmetric risk play, nobody expects it, which is why it'll be bigger than it needs to be
What's the point of owning three long options at three different strike prices?

Don’t be fooled
Fuck libtards and FUCK ANTIFA
Thanks. Will probably buy and sell tomorrow now
Haha the two fuckers who posted them haven’t replied and I can’t find anything online.
The 1 year and 5 year charts on TSLA are insane. Almost straight up.   I bought at 220 and sold at 240 and thought i did well :( .

Loaded up on Friday before close. In hindsight should've waited until after election but I'm confident they'll print
It’s a hard life brother a hard life out there
That would have worked Friday morning, all day. Buying them EOD before the weekend was the most retarded thing ever. You'll fit right in here.
First options trade and decides to be a 🌈🐻
A grown ass man that plays with his pp 🤡
with the exception of SPCE and BA this looks good to me. Covid isn't going anywhere any time soon. Most of these stocks will benefit from renewed lockdowns.

I see why you dropped airlines in as a recovery play. If we get a vaccine those will rocket too. I'm actually pretty skeptical of a vaccine really doing much of anything before late next year when the winter spike comes again. It may be ready by then.
Lol yea not relevant to their opinon

Karmas gay anyway. Accept when you have a bunch on a comment, its kinda dope
Again again
/u/smallchimpu, why have you forsaken us?

This week above all others we could use someone to tell us what range SPY will trade in
Nathan Peterman is better than these scrubs
Just saw ON crushed earnings. Hopefully they get an uninterrupted moon mission this week. 

They’re def the next target acquisition in the semi conductor space
That's why I like OP's core thesis. Get rich by 25-30 or so and don't worry about the whole flawed retirement concept.

I just recommend replacing yoloing FDs with getting skills and yoloing your job on startups
Is that what Melania and trumpet did? Must have been quite a scene
Better tell the Big Guy abt his 10pack.
That's perfect. Thanks for letting me know what to avoid King.
God quarantine is getting so fucking boring. I never realized how little I took advantage of being able to go anywhere and do anything anytime I wanted

Why does futes 1min chart gap around so much? Like very small candles none touching their neighbors
Stfu trash
Must not realize NASDAQ is on a level of support. And consolidating Trump is ahead in the live election MMs know.

The only way to tendietown now is by rocket 🚀. All aboard for calls.
I sadly live there and I’m it’s horrific what’s going on, only human filth walks around. I’m staying as I got a hefty reduction in rent for the time being. But if we do lockdown again, I’m out of here.

See what I mean tho? Started +.40% then went to -.60% then back to +.20% and now flat as fuck never really seen it so this
May have a run like JCP and HTZ???
Trailing stop order works fine when you want to limit your losses while riding the momentum. However, my question is for setting a minimum price target that is above the current price and riding momentum on top of that.

If Biden takes office, people will stop saying how bad trump has handled it (rightfully). Once that stops, as long as Biden doesn’t do anything really stupid, Covid will still be around but almost not talked about at all.

Right now it’s just used as a political club to beat trump over the head with. Again, deservedly so
Except the majority that are praying for their calls
What kinda son calls their dad daddy.
But in all seriousness we have a record number of 25-35 year olds living with their parents and, of those who don't, a fuckton of people are about to default on their mortgages or get evicted.
I have some that I'll be selling tomorrow. I expect a slight rise tomorrow followed by an election day dump so I'll be switching to puts.
They can be!
We're entering a bull market until January. Biden win means Gigantic January Stimulus. Inflation goes BRRRRRRRRRRR
They consolidate once in a while but life always goes on and ceases to amaze.
Checking election polls and stressing over them is to r/politics as checking futures and stressing over them is to r/WallStreetBets

Minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Assuming you could find a job that would give you a full 40 hours a week while in high school and college, that's $290 per week or $15,080 per year. That's not including taxes or any possible expenses like you know food. So somehow OP suggests an unskilled high school student getting a job that pays double minimum wage and saving every goddamn dime until 25. I have encountered many retards who are usually just uninformed but you truly live in a Trump state of delusion. Please do not breed.

Fuck and rent. Cheaper both ways
The entire concept of “retirement” is flawed. Working for life (upper 60s) for a pension and 401k is a sad system. That’s the only thing that rings true in the OPs retarded essay. By the time the average person retires they can’t truly enjoy the fruits of their labor. The OPs thesis that the average person has the capital to even attempt a worthwhile yolo to break the cycle is smooth brained.
You think they would make it this easy to buy puts and make a bunch of money😂

You have portfolio margin. You can’t leverage beyond your investment for Reg T.
So sad to see people still relying on fundamentals if this shutdown taught me anything fundamentals ain’t shit, so the market is going to do what the market wants to do with whoever gets in presidency.
I mean, they're not uneducated, retarded, inward-looking hillbillies there. Which can seem jarring to tucker carlson viewers.

My wife has one, I just didn't know what it was called.  Personally I just don't squeeze hard enough to activate the buttons. It's a good money-making idea though.
Turn on margin then YOLO 100k on $TSLA -> then take whichever girlfriend you want out with your winnings bro.
Of course I wear a mask around too, the city is pretty dead around my parts but when I go out to the island it does sort of seem like normal, yes prices in the burbs are booming I told my family to sell and get the fuck out
More like a peach
Get married first and then get a house, fewer things can go wrong
In NY some people say "axe them" instead of "ask them." It's so stupid
It never matters, youll figure that out one day. The only news that impacts the market is news no one saw coming. Like if China nukes Austrailia tonight, thats news you should play but the issue is you'll be too late anyway because they will just sell in dark pools.

PINS had huge selling off thursday gap up. Red candle outside bollinger band is kiss of death

PINS $58P 11/13 

Stop loss at $61, profit target is .382 fibonacci at $51.50
Would rather go balls deep on puts on one, but I guess you’re right - go full retard and split puts on both. 

What do you think is a good strike price for each?
I said sleepys son enjoys getting a footy while smoking a crack pipe and they said for me to not judge people’s kinky-ness

Trump did all the legwork. If a company brings on a new CEO that shits all over everything and is absolutely terrible then the board of directors will vote to have him removed. Even if the next available replacement isn’t what they really wanted, it’ll be better than the dude shitting everywhere.

who’s exactly?
yes
Futures tag... Always get excited when I see posts with these, only to be let down.

You should spread the gospel of futures like you used to. Traders are going to overpay for losing options this week.
don’t even have a hedge , just holding straight vxx calls🤡
Abidin Biden. Trump go Bye then

$60 deposited every week for 7 months, initial deposit of $100; gotta make up 3k in gains in those 7 months
How does it feel to be a previous bottom ?
PINS = retard strength  
SNAP = retard strength  
  
What's your logic? That they cancel each other out if you buy puts on both?
Should I save up $50k...put down payment on a house and then get married...or get married first and THEN buy a house
This sub is literally the blind poors leading the stupid poors and I love it the advice you see here omg
Naked options, are ones that you sold, without the shares or cash to back it up. Damn some of you guys are dumb
My parents ugly asf bro have fun :D
Whats a better play before election china calls or weed calls???
The entire concept of expenses is lost on you. The only way you’d save your entire salary is if you didn’t spend any money on rent, insurance, bills, food, activities. You’d have to have someone else providing all of that for you. For someone living with their mom in their 30s like you I can absolutely see where you got this rationale.
that’s what i’m trying to ascertain

If brr wasn't really over, we'd see it after it hit 357.. The fact that we are where we are now implies its more than over
Is it me or I really think we trade mostly flat now till Europe opens? It's gonna be either eurorich or europoor which will determine whether we are ameririch or ameripoor
Bulls and Bears are fighting on WSB. On the other side, MMs are calculating how many calls and puts are out there and who do they need to fuk (bulls or bears) this week so they can make out like bandits by confiscating their premiums.

Have you tested this in a high IV environment? Obviously the options will reprice in the morning but a 326 straddle is sitting at $700/pair right now, that’s pricing in a considerable move and I think theta and IV could rain on your parade a bit this week

Sounds like the mods did their jobs
But they are. That’s the thing. America can have socialism that allows underprivileged people to have better worker protections, wages, and education, while also allowing capitalism to drive growth, innovation, and ensure that our economy is a meritocracy. Neither 100% socialism or 100% capitalism is a good idea. There should be a balance. Right now capitalism severely outweighs socialism is our country, which has lead to super conglomerate corporations that lobby to deregulate comsumer/worker protections, destroy the environment, and create class conflicts.

Do you believe that a landslide from either candidate would lead to a climb? It feels that the market is pricing/anticipating a possible contested election.

Either way, how long should I hold in all of your opinions? To expiration or take some decent profits if the market dips big some day this week?

And frankly I agree that stocks should help the average person. It’s a shame that finance makes up 20% of our GDP and only a small percent can take advantage of if. But should be blow it up?

I think that innovations in 401ks, ETFs, and even Robinhood, have made it easier for everyone to participate. If someone is left out, you don’t blown it up, you fix it to where they can be involved.

#but who would have thought, the real way to get in before and out before the rest of the "herd" is to just trade futures.. well, I'm getting ready to short the /NQ which is the Nasdaq futures, and Maybe I'll short the S&P futures too.. but I'm not sure yet (/ES)

Do you mean when to time how election cycle affects economy?

In which case, maybe Election Cycle Theory is what you're looking for?

From 1950-2010ish the S&P has returned

* Year after the election: +6.5%
* Second year: +7.0%
* Third year: +16.4%
* Fourth year: +6.6%

So if theres any sort of negative sentiment affecting markets, it'll typically happen on election year (4th year), and the first year after the election. 

Once the dust settles, we see it pick up in 2nd/3rd year.

Hi I’m from r politics and i read your comment and I’m literally shaking and crying rn how can you be such a monster sir
Definitely agree. My mother was actually going through chemo, starting in fucking March of course, and I was her primary caregiver. People gave me shit for being too safe and isolating but I wasn't doing it for myself. I was even wearing a mask when I made food, did dishes and laundry, or cleaned the common area. It turned out okay in the end, apparently (found out recently) we had it in late February and the antibodies mostly held up. We're in Florida and I was physically in college at the second largest hotspot of the "new global epicenter".

I think wall st realized they would rather pay more taxes than the BS they had to deal with his twitter account and unnecessary trade wars BS.

Anyone remembers that weekend when he caught everyone by surprise and tanked the markets in weekend.   Even big hedge funds were caught by surprise.  I think it was in first quarter of 2019 when he announced tariffs.  The last one from 3 weeks ago was probably the last straw when he announced no stimulus deal on twitter.

We have pretty good contact tracing in my area & they’re finding some infections at schools, but they get isolated quickly & none have turned into actual outbreaks. 

The problems seem to be coming from private events - parties, weddings etc. We’re far more careful at the grocery store than we are at home. 

There were a bunch of ads asking people not to go to Halloween parties this year. I’m happy to see the gov here following the science.

No need to close down all the “non-essential” businesses again (Eg. nail salons that have installed plexiglas barriers & wear masks) if that’s NOT where infections are coming from.
They make WSB sound sane and logical. It’s sad.

FDR implemented ‘socialist’ legislation that reduced wealth inequality and provided the best class mobility in the history of the US. Fuck even social security is ‘socialist’. But every boomer conservative will beat the ground saying they deserve it.

looking at premarket.. not good tomorrow at least...
No he’s gonna declare it before it’s projected. Biden’s gonna challenge and then trumps gonna say that it’s the “illegal mail in ballots” it’s gonna go on for a week or someshit.
The more bullish the market, the more brittle.
1. Trump take an L
2. Tweets and crashes the market
3. Take it to court 
4. Civil war
5. Calls on S&W
6. Retire on all the strippers and blow you can handle
Open flat, finish flat.

Bullshit. 🥭 Has utterly fucked American manufacturers more than Obama or Carter. Outside of tech Stonks, 🥭 even managed to fuck over the entire energy industry and DoD. 

Bidens not even liberal. AOC or Bernie, yeah? But holy shit Biden is a centrasit who's significantly better for Corporate Interests and American Manufacturing all around. Higher taxes don't mean shit when you have accountants who can get around them. You want Stonks to go up? Stop fucking pumping and dumping on Twitter. Stop this shutting down the government. Stop trying to win a trade war without a comprehensive plan.

id expect most of them to be serious considering socialists have a pretty bad track record

I disagree. Making money gives me life
"On August 22, BioReference Laboratories reported an elevated number of positive COVID-19 PCR test results for NFL players and personnel at multiple clubs. The NFL immediately took necessary actions to ensure the safety of the players and personnel. Our investigation indicated that these were most likely false positive results, caused by an isolated contamination during test preparation in the New Jersey laboratory. Reagents, analyzers and staff were all ruled out as possible causes and subsequent testing has indicated that the issue has been resolved. All individuals impacted have been confirmed negative and informed.” Per NFL.com

I guess i just disagree with your overall point, I would say testing is accurate for the most part with isolated incidents. Rather than saying the testing itself is flawed more like the lab conditions and people conducting the tests are flawed.
Maybe

Tales out of the commercial market world is that many are scared of Q2 2022. So many companies are going out of business that there a far fewer to renew their leases. This will have a knock on effect into the insurance market. From there into financials since insurance uses stocks and such to make their money.

WSB media coverage lead uneducated, low income (often minimum wage workers holding no degree or degree in humanities) Americans to believe they somehow any chance of making it in US equities. Most likely will last about 2-3 months before they blow up their accounts and return to daddy McDonald’s complaining how corporate America owns them, when in reality it’s their naive victimized thought process that lead them to believe they had a chance in the markets in the first place.

Fair point. Also interesting to point out that if it worked, you'd have near definitive proof that the Many Worlds Interpretation is correct. If you needed further proof you could just do the experiment a second time to win the lotto twice. You could then rig the program to allow you to live if any number of criteria are met.. Essentially engineering your own reality.

What do you mean?
Bulls r fuk || Bears r fuk
aw lighten up man
You’re argument is that capitalism is so bad that, even though you’re actively participating in it, that you should fundamentally bet against it? What’s incentivized more innovation in the last 100 years than 2000 prior? What’s pulled billions out of poverty globally over the last 50 years? What should we replace it with? 

Trash bear argument, but go ahead and do those mental gymnastics to make yourself feel better about profiting on human suffering.
It's still on.
2 months late is better than never for a decent stock.. this isnt gamestop
Their real title is pigs.
Cant say i share you on that.

Trump’s dumbass tweeting made the market way less predictable. Besides a biden win will crash the market in the short term which makes things very attractive for a buy in.
priced in bro everyone expects that
Before it went to shit it was $15, you expected it to go another 60%

Cant expect a straight line up or a straight line down, playing 11/20 330p spy for me, will sell when elevator down speeds up
No, the point wasn't to use them because they fail less, but because they're binary.  If you're surrounded by explosives, then if they go off, there's virtually no chance you're alive.  Failure means you just wake up disappointed.  People have had to be hit with a guillotine more than once to go through ect.
I met Trump at a bowling alley in 2013. He was the oldest person there and kept saying how he wasn’t “too old” for pranks. He said “this is my most powerful prank. I’m going to knock up your wife. I’m not afraid of the law, and I don’t get along with strangers."

Most recent was one was above price.

If SPY goes up 2% will create an amazing entry for some weekly puts on the SPY or calls on the SPXS (leveraged inverse SPY) no I am not a bear or ever was but fuck me I will scalp some money while my portfolio shits out another huge decline, its called a hedge.

If tomorrow is green def gonna go cash gang til after the election results are ironed out I can’t take this anymore 😩

Yes bears are fucked. Its insane to me they don't cash out. I sold my amzn puts and went full yolo on Google calls. I knew the market would cancel all those puts bought last week.
Too many of you bought puts. Solid green climb not gonna stop til these puts get sold for a loss.

On par with compsci and engineering degrees.
Let's be real, if this opens anywhere above 0.9% green, just jump into calls for the day. Anything below is questionable
Pretty sure it will start drilling at 1 am est an hour before london opens just like on Friday. Save this.

Pro tip: volatility swings both ways
RIPPIN IS RIPPIN.
the exams are really hard
But a few months later, it's like if it never happened. 2000 and 2008 sent us into 2/1.5 year bear markets.
Doesn’t need for sure but msft online store is...meh. And she’s going harder into gaming (esp 2 years now) acquiring gaming companies like zenimax.  
Perhaps, a bigger, more flexible and expansive presence, through varied venues is what they’re after. Maybe.
And then for no reason at all, people started buying.
Obviously the market will be flat.
Is this what Burry wanted with all those calls
If EU opens green, bearskin rugs for us all! 🇺🇸
It's just math.
Naw we buy dips in 2020

Thoughts on AAPL puts tmrw?
IPOC shoulda been Coinbase!
The ultimate Max Pain "Fuck You" tomorrow would be opening green, letting all the bears sell their puts at a loss while the bulls gloat, then 30 minutes later, a near instantaneous -3% across all indices.
Bears are so fuk lol. They were so happy.
OP’s coworkers: “Yea, see ya tomorrow”
i don’t know enviflux123, it’s just a feeling

Watched a documentary on how Goldman Sachs bought up aluminum storage warehouses in Michigan then just moved the aluminum from warehouse to warehouse instead of sending it out to customers while betting against the price of aluminum. The stuff some of these firms do is fucking wild, they of course ended up getting nailed but imagine how much shit slips through the cracks hahahahaha
Prediction: Legacy market pumps while memecoin dumps, then legacy market channels sideways and memecoin pumps, then legacy market giga pumps and memecoin giga dumps, then memecoin arises from the dead and legacy and memecoin pump together to the moon throughout 2021.
People celebrating 0.5% moves like IV and theta aren't going to crush everyone this week.
Nah even the value of SP500 is different. currently 3269 finviz, and 3273 on investing
Red by open bulls r fucked
Yeah there'd be a chance of other mechanisms going wrong, so you'd want to minimize those chances. If you have a 1/10,000,000 chance of winning the lotto, then you want your setup to have a <1/100,000,000 chance of failure. That way you're 10x more likely to wake up to a winning lotto ticket than a system malfunction. Maybe scrap the poison box in preference of a guillotine.. Less things to go wrong. Make sure the program you write is bullet-proof. Stuff like that.
True but it’s gonna drop a ton first and then go up.

Well, good luck.

hello gay bears how’s ur SPY 300 PUT 11/2/20 doing?
You decide your play. I’m in SEDG personally.
I think the only possible plays in this market are SQQQ and UVXY calls. AAPL also looking like a juicy short
I think the president would have to bend over, spread his cheeks, and show his orange butthole on national television to get a triple circuit breaker, but I’m not saying it’s impossible
We have to be up at least 1000 point Monday right?

Lol well I can understand why you’ve deleted things. I have no reason to not believe anything you are telling me. And I certainly do not need a sugar mommy. I am curious about your methods. It’s obvious you have found something successful. Sadly this sub is inundated with useless garbage that sometimes gives me a laugh but I’m too busy at work to hunt down every post to find if it was legitimate. Wish I’d seen more of yours, I do remember the overstock pick. You may not be able to share much about your models especially in a public forum such as this. But I always like to ask people that are clearly more of an expert in their fields how they operate. This has been probably the most interesting conversation I’ve had on this sub lol.

I am/have been a believer in some of the private companies out there including spacex (have been for a while) but unfortunately I am a poor resident that doesn’t have access to that kind of investing.

I agree that medicine is slow, some of it is the regulations and legality behind it all but some of it truly is resistance to change and adoption of technology by medical professionals. Actually, one of the reasons I chose to be a radiologist was because I saw a potential to be an early adopter in things like ML and AI-supported medicine.
Why do I own shares of BAC??, should I sell them at a loss?

You’ve actually convinced me
So is this gonna be a flat day huh
AAPL calls get you to work?
No they didn't, investing.com just changed their marker for start % change

We went from 3246 low to 3470 high.

That's not -0.8 to +0.2. It's 24 points, which is like a 0.7% swing total.

Lol after the past 2 months of ass blasting any green is hulk dildos
I don't know what it's going to do one way or another, but this is ass backwards.  When people think a thing is quickly becoming worthless, they panic sell it, thus making it worthless.  I mean look at Q1 2020.  Everyone thought COVID would crash markets, so it did.
yea but this time its different

I googled it and according to harvard it is more likely for tests to show false negative than false positive. None of the tests available as of september are FDA approved. I haven’t paid much attention to the accuracy rate of covid testing but within minutes of googling false positive testing I came up with results showing the opposite is more likely to be true. Do you have a source for false positives?

It's too obvious after how Friday's close happened. Bears were just high on hopes due to Europe news... We might legit see a full % green today.
That was April.

This fucking sub... 

Futures down .5 and it's flat. Futures up .5 and it's BLOOD GREEN BERS R FUK. 

Pathetic.
There was way less debt out there and a lot more savings, so the economy could actually handle rates that high without completely crumbling, unlike today. The Dow would be 6000 pts if rates go to 10% today. Not to mention 10% rates were "low" compared with the early 80s.

Serious answer. It can be as short as a few days before you start feeling withdrawal after stopping
This isn’t completely unreasonable. One last fuck you to own the libs.
Nope, I disagree.  I think finality in the election is all the market needs.  Either way, good ol stimmy is on its way.  So why try to time the market once finality in the election has been determined.

Hey man, you okay?
I deposited 10k going to yolo it into 1 month QQQ and/or SPY puts, most likely QQQ
i’m scared
This was late 90's dotcom bubble era, I chose to Yolo on a company called Fatbrain.com which was basically Amazon back then, an e-commerce book seller. They eventually got bought by Barnes and Nobles for 65 mill and Amazon went on to become well Amazon. Don't let me pick your horses. I had to choose between $18 amazon stock or the one I chose. I gambled wrong.
We cry
Holy shit fuck, the game is ridiculous, look at futures.
It's not just 0.01% green. Almost up 0.20%

Why are we green?

Biden win is a short term tank.  The only way this goes to is Clean trump win
#That's actually correct and I agree with you 100% only for this specific reason and only this specific reason :

#I noticed on the options a lot of puts and more under $300-ish even and that should not be happening, as NOBODY should be worried or hedging Tesla under $300 at all... so That means they have a drop "priced in" and yes, I also believe Tesla will head down from here first and then later rally only up to $560-570 at most.. and that is Later, 

#The short term we will have pain and people holding calls and shares will be hurt and they will have 2 options to choose, either :

#1. close out and buy lower

#2. Average down
All you need to do is look at FTSE Futures to see how fake and gay this pump is.

Bears have called 1000 of the last 10 downturns.
They pack the hydrocodone in so much acetaminophen that it makes you feel like shit if you use it often. At least for me it did.

But those opiates are no joke. Upgrade to heroin now and skip a step.

Hard to speculate. They are already partnered with a ton of great restaurants though and I personally use them every other month in addition to postmates, favor and Uber eats. They have food only available on their platform in my city because of their model of acquiring partnerships early and making their offerings exclusive.
Choose a life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television. Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers... Choose DSY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit crushing game shows, stucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away in the end of it all, pishing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourself, choose your future. Choose life... But why would I want to do a thing like that?
I just hope they buy the stocks in my portfolio lol.

Half the sub went bearish on Friday

Half the sub will be wiped on Monday
The day is January 1st 2021. We don't know who the president is. Stimulus talks are going well. The indexes hit four subsequent ATH tops in Q4. Vix has a 50DMA of $100. Coronavirus has infected 60% of the country. California has burned to the ground. GDP has risen another 40% Q/Q. Vaccine will be released "soon". JPow reduces rates to -5% and is on a constant amphetamine drip. Bulls yell DOW 40,000 from the rooftops while bears burn their money on put-fires to stay warm. Elon musk tattooed "Bull Gang" across his throat.
How much do you think it would be?
Bears and shambles... name a more iconic duo.
Uvxy calls. This is the way.
mark my words, states will announce lock downs after the erection

they cant do it before because it fucks voting
You've been copy pasting this for like 3 days now dude
this is ambitious but I think it could work out
If Trump wins or loses we probably get one before January, but it won't be the size of stimulus that gets the market erect. If Dems get senate and prez the market is going to be edging like a MF for the January brrrrr.

*The melt-up is beginning.*

*October is going to be a big turnaround month for both the stock market and precious metals. Both are set up for big reversals upward. Could be a very historic month for the markets. Should see S&P to 4500, DJIA to 36,000 & Nasdaq to 15,000 in 4th qtr. We will also see gold to $2300-$2500 & silver to $35-$36. GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75, SILJ to $30. Oil to $50-$55.

I actually have been giving this some real thought for a few years.  Not of actually doing it but just running thought experiments to see if it would work.  I came to the conclusion that it's extremely flawed.  If the many worlds theory is correct, then you would default to the nearest time divergent to your previous reality.  Well, since you bought the ticket hours/days ago, the most recent change would be if the machine read the ticket wrong, or the cyanide failed to release, or it did, but you don't die, just suffer debilitating neurological damage for the rest of your life ect.

Nah, he got good prices with TSLA. To be honest I'm a little jealous for that.
I mean the same pattern is seen in the 1929 crash and the dotcom bubble. Macro trends are typically more reliable than micro trends
Interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.
i have never voted for anyone actually and i am a registered democrat.  neither of the candidates are fit to be president, same as 2016.
Bull trap tomorrow -> MMs will watch closely during Tuesdays election to look for preliminary information on potential outcome of election -> if election close (nobody over 270) then stonks will tank -> if trump looks like he won, stocks soar -> if Biden looks like he won, stonks soar.   This is the play.

You don’t know how strict this will get. These 1/21 options are 20%+ OTM with less than 3 months til exp. he’s already down 36% on FDX. He can salvage the rest with minimal losses and his shares and leaps to 2022+ will be fine. He can roll the Januarys out and sleep better.
That mean I’ll be able to move prices Bucky when I buy .02 of tsla shares tomorrow? If so buy calks
Gives yolo advice and doesn’t even have a fucking yolo play for us. BAN
Double top has been formed, don’t be fooled by the little pump green day’s. This baby tanking like the titanic, sorry dip buyers
I'm skeptical they are positive based on the creepto currency announcement timing
We seriously recovered from -1.10%
If Donny wins streets filled with protesters and massive civil unrest, if Joe wins Donny takes it to the courts for recount. Sounds like lose lose
Lmfao ok? I’m still probably gonna wake up to a bloodbath across the board

Let me tell you something. There is no nobility in poverty. I’ve been a rich man, and I’ve been poor man. And I choose rich every fucking time. Cause, At least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit …and $40,000 gold fuckin’ watch!

Now, if anyone here thinks I’m superficial or materialistic. Go get a job at fucking McDonald’s, because that’s where you fucking belong!
But, before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to you, go on. Because sometime in the not-so-distant future, you’re pullin’ up to a red light in your beat-up old fucking Pinto, and that person’s gonna pull up right alongside you in a brand new Porsche, with their beautiful wife by his side, whose got big voluptuous tits. And who will you be next to? Some disgusting wilder beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload full of groceries from the fucking Price Club! That’s who you’re gonna be sitting next to.

So, you listen to me and you listen well. Are you behind, on your credit card bills? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Is your landlord ready to evict you? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Does your girlfriend think you’re a fucking loser? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing! I want you to deal with your problems, by becoming rich! All you have to do today …is pick up that phone, and speak the words that I have taught you. And I’ll make you richer than the most powerful CEO of the United States of fucking America. I want you to go out there, and I want you to RAM Steve Madden stock down your clients’ throats. Till they fucking choke on it till they choke on it and buy 100,000 shares! That’s what I want you to do.

You’ll be ferocious! You’ll be relentless! You’ll be telephone fucking terrorists! Now, let’s knock this Motherfucker out of the park!
Idk ask Putin

But I also applied to the FBI and the CIA because I was watching A LOT of 24 back in the day and thought Jack Bauer had the coolest job.

Take the mindset that no matter what happens you are in an infinitely better position than 70-80% of the humans born into this world, and the outcome of your degree isn't the end of the world. Keep going, work hard, and things will work out in your favor if you are diligent. Finish the degree.

Ya'll are being silly billies.  There's so much unknown for the next week.  Use a little capital to make some big plays and see if they pan out.  Make bets on who's going to win the election with Oil and Solar stocks.  Make a play on civil unrest.  Have some fun with this week, these types of opportunities don't show up often.

Personally I'm a fan of SEDG getting a strong boost in the coming weeks.
Europoors hitting that sell button as soon as their market opens. They’re so risk adverse it’s funny

I’ve never used Robinhood as it’s a POS and legit brokerages now offer commission free trading, blows my mind that people still use that garbage. But unless it’s completely different, you get approved for margin and then the amount of margin you’re allowed to use varies depending on the factors I mentioned previously. If I spread it out across diversified positions I would be able to get 2-4x leverage, if I tried to put it all in on one position I would get little to no margin allowance.

Agreed.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday will all be down this week.  Maybe a couple dead cat bounces on Tues/Thurs.
i think it opens flat
do you even have a price target for fair value? Or looking at that macro on more local time scales. Or did you only make it so far as "down"

Starting to feel really smart for yoloing all in Sony calls for January
I have a weird chimpu thesis that I’d like to share: Monday and Tuesday spy is going to be pinned at 324-326–effectively where we started 2020. Meanwhile premiums will be elevated to extract as much value from investors that want to make directional bets and/or hedge for the initial election outcome. TLDR: Many will be fucked this week.

About $1500...  my account isn't very big, which is why I wasn't inclined to YOLO...

I should also mention I had Sony calls that were ITM and sold the day before earnings (they beat EPS estimates by 280%) because I was nervous about the exposure to market volatility.

Its was just a shitty week for me.

If you don’t think it’s priced in after last week idk what to tell you
Yeah but it was 13.35 percent in 1980. So technically the interest rates had been going down prior to the interest rates of 1987. Which sounds like they were trying to create inflation....they seem high but they were going lower at the time.

You know, it’s possible to make money with options, just because you can’t doesn’t mean it’s impossible.

We will never see circuit breakers unless we see something scarier or a worse black swan than a viral pandemic from China.  We recovered and reached all time highs, gonna take alot more than a contested election to drop that low. The spike in cases feels super on point with the fear Trump narrative but most traders see through the bs because we gotta watch Pelosi speak live, trump, etc. But who knows could go either way. The main consensus being bearish is too big idk seems off
dead and gone dead and gone. but i think it becomes tdoc...
Next day and a half will be bullish and Tuesday will be brutal... especially if no clear winner.
I really hope SBUX and PM along with solar get pumped this week.

This is such bullshit.  Fake and gay.  Shit is so manipulated!!

But idk, if you're overly safe you're fine. I played big tech earnings with some iron condors and did okay. Also actually made a directional play for once in SPY put debit spreads which worked out as well.

The biggest problem with both oversold and overbought is that it can stay in "over" zone for long time periods.

I don’t think most retards here understand how margin works. At most brokers, you will not get margin, or at least the amount will be vastly lower, if it’s all going towards one position. You don’t call up your broker and say “hi I’d like one margin please”. You get approved for margin and it allows you to use it based off the cash in your account, diversity of positions, etc. So this would not work for a single stock yolo

Pack it in guys, this ones got it figured out.
Problem is polls gauge popular opinion, and that's not how we elect the prez here.  For a more accurate read, convert the average state poll (five thirty-eight should have most states) into electoral college votes.  

Even then, the margin of error likely exceeds the actual winning margins in the states that will actually determine the winner, so you have a very educated guess as a result. 

In conclusion, you're fucking right and I typed a bunch of shit for nothing.
What stock/ETF is it ok to lose your money on? Like let’s say u got blown the fuck out and you had to tell the story. Can u imagine telling ur wife “oh honey I bet our savings on fucking GameStop” or “ayo I took out the 401k on a mattress company”

with companies like zoom, they either keep running up or they start to crash, it's only worth this much because of FOMO and not fundamentals. I could be wrong on it going down this hard but there's no way it stays flat for long and it's got a long drop below it.
Short of a loan shark why not? Personal safety aside let it ride for one time. As long as your ok with poverty for the next decade there is only upside. I’ve got a friend who basically did this with online poker about 10 years ago. Student loans + car wreck and no insurance + poker debt. He is a bar tender now and his boss pays him the minimum on the books and rest in cash under the table. Not exactly legal but that’s the future of the downside. It’s not the worst case scenario but not so bad

You’re fine. I have a poli sci degree. I make solid money. Most jobs that arent professional jobs just require you to have a degree. And having no workplace experience can be spun as a positive since you don’t have bad habits and can be taught exactly how they want you to do the job. As opposed to someone with previous experience who thinks the job should be done how they think it should be done. 

Work hard, be inquisitive, take lots of notes, be interested. Older coworkers/bosses have years of knowledge and  are valuable assets. Return the favors by helping them with tech/computer problems. Even if you don’t know the answer, you know how to google to find the answer. 

Best of luck. You’ll be alright!
Deaths are a lagging indicator by like a month. That being said last time we had a huge spike in cases in julyish deaths never really spiked after that either so we're prolly gonna be fine unless hospitals start getting overfilled again.

Not kidding about Rocket Bears being fucked. There is almost an 18 percent short interest in RKT when they have the only technology in the mortgage industry right now that can scale to meet this unprecedented demand, while making key acquisitions including Rocket Auto for an additional revenue stream while further diversifying the RKT companies portfolio.
It's almost like they want to spend money on their platforms and ideals. But don't want democrats spending on theirs.

It's fucked that's how it is. Conservative politics should always be debt hawks. But that would require them to be actually conservative politicians instead of this bullshit tea party-ish party that we have.

Their populations are tiny and so spread out. And Australia in particular, the hot tempetures make it difficult for a virus like this to survive and spread.
Plus I personally think the strain in Europe and the USA is worse than what Australia/NZ have dealt with.

Why do any of you give a shit? You’re gonna blow up your account anyway regardless as to who gets elected.
It's tough. I have some Jan'21 calls that I plan to let ride unless we move approach the 200dma (hopefully, not). If you are hedging then I don't think the exact moment you sell is crucial. But, if you want to maximise your gains then you have to try and pick the bottom (which will be the top for SPXS). Also, be aware that a lot of people seem to sell these off right at the end of the day.
How about you do it, then live to tell your legendary story for ages and upvotes on reddit?

Literally nothing about the stock market can be correlated to tax rates. It might matter at the very edge of the margins but not so much that you'd ever even notice. You ever once see a stock go down because they paid their taxes? 

"We had a blowout quarter, revenue up 32%, EBIT up 27% but we had to pay 32% in taxes." 

Stock gets crushed? No, never, not even once.

It doesn't happen. Stocks go up and down based on their revenue and EBIT. It's always been that way.

Shut down. What good is money if it can’t be spent
A lot of assumptions there. I use "mango" and "sleepy" because it fits the tone of this sub and my politics aren't what you think they are. I've also done well with the little solar stock boom we had because I've been interested in it for a while, though I'm probably too bullish on it at times.

I was curious about what others thought about it because it shot up incredibly fast and has trailed off more recently. Wondering if they could start running again in the short term or if they'll need to be long-term plays.
That's a bearish signal if I've ever seen one
You’re right, especially if Biden gets elected almost a guarantee

I like JD, but Tencent is just Snapchat, Fortnite, Tiktok and Tesla stock in a holding company. Rather just own those companies considering TCEHY fate hinges on their success. That being said I do not want to invest in Tesla or Fortnite, or tiktok but I do want to invest in Snapchat at the current valuation. I find it VERY compelling. So, I like WB, JD, and SNAP and can't forget Activision for tech stocks. I also like the HACK etf. Finally, I like Walgreens for a deep value dividend play.

Yeah on a call that it would be a landslide how wouldn’t someone at least be confident enough for a 1:1 bet. Without betting this at least proves they don’t stand behind their opinion.

1. buy puts
2. Institute a financial transaction tax on every buy/sell of stock or options
3. close puts
4. Change the law so Congress isn't allowed to trade stocks anymore. No one can ever duplicate your success. The perfect crime
But ... thats the problem, 30+% GDP growth looks great in a vacuum, but that puts us at Great Recession GDP levels. If we’re looking at GDP, an indicator you said we should focus on, thats not necessarily a good sign. Q4 is going to be make or break tbh because we’ll see the extent this new wave has on the economy + the lack of stimulus.

This is exactly what goes on. The most major of crisis happens under republican presidency and the republican always gets an excuse to run up gov spending due to some kind of major disaster so you don’t blame the repub dude

Why would there be a dump? You saw a very red week  last week, people have already made their moves, there is no new news that would cause a panic. Do not get in to the trap of thinking dumps that we saw in March was normal, it wasn’t and you won’t see it again for a long time.

Is anyone here acquainted with literally anyone who plans to violently protest if their preferred candidate loses? Why am I constantly reading about the “presumed riots” like it’s a forgone conclusion. I know 0 people who plan to do more than strong talk on fb/twitter and I’m in Philly, which should be ground 0 according to these constant headlines. Fearmongering bs for clicks?
Good luck in these trying times bro. IMO the oil dip is worse for Alberta than the pandemic.

Nah everywhere, you're looking at the spike from an OTC order, that's not something you consider when talking about highs and lows at a specific time period cause it happened at a past undisclosed time and just went into the book afterhours.
yes please 🙏📉
Yeah right about most anything... except Telsa for about 4 months and PRPL.. but that's definitely it.... and maybe GLD and SLV, Pfizer, Astrazenica, Wayfair, Moderna, Amazon. UPS, FedEx and many. Many others over the last 7 months. But you can say for sure the common man is very unlikely to be right about anything the will happen or has happened in the markets in this highly unpredictable market... and RKT for a brief moment after its last earnings. BUT NO MORE!!!
Sell coke to traders, get that sweet "insider info", yolo 0tde, rinse and repeat
Cars are repo’d really easy and can get sold for full value really easy as well which is why banks don’t really care about the risk as much .

Fuck up a mortgage especially now the bank might take 2 years to get it sold and lose money . My friend in 2008 had his house short sale and stayed 18 months without paying the mortgage til it got sold .  Mortgage was 550k the neighbors house sold for 425k he asked the bank to adjust the mortgage and he would pay it for the 425k but they said no . Cpa and lawyer both said get rid of the thing and it worked out his credit is fine now and he got a new house
If you’re a 🌈🐻 and are considering any long term SPY put positions, do yourself a favor. Block out all the headline noise and near term election volatility and take a look at the top two leading indicators that all major investment firms, investment banks and hedge funds use to determine where the market is headed. GDP and CPI. Notice a trend? 

Don’t get caught with shorts around your ankles like the bears did in April. Lots of New Ridh bears soon found themselves New Poor. 😂

I wouldnt be too worried, it looks like he's not winning they key states he did the first time around, and after he passed more gun laws than the previous democrat pres, he's lost more of his base to third party candidates.

Anyone else shocked at how fast this election came? I literally had no clue there was an election coming up until last week so I sold out of the market.

It would be nice if they gave us a heads up when elections happen so we have some more time to make investment decisions. Leaving elections as a surprise until the week before is obviously gonna cause a selloff.

Anyone else agree?

Election results won't be out until weekends most likely
I agree this is the likely scenario, I’m hedging my calls with UVXY calls but would be nice to see a clear outcome on this shit show soon
I saw this political guy on Twitter laying out the case that they could straight up tie in the electoral college. 

Then to break a tie, as dictated in the constitution, Biden and Trump play a game of 21 to decide it.
This country will not allow interest rates to go up again ever. It used to be a tool to stimulate the economy. Now it’s used to keep the good times rolling. Property will continue to appreciate.
Can’t believe I have to say this but, some of you guys do realize that the weekend dow literally means fuck all right?

I am also in pretty deep in CRIS.

REPL is another holding of mine.

I'm short XBI via December put spreads as a hedge for the above.

I pulled $100k out from my CRDF profits to buy a house that I close on this week.

I'm being conservative for the moment, but that's primarily because of my personal situation.

Sell OTM puts, buy OTM calls. Risk reversals for a credit or even is the trade on all stocks right now. Get out to January or further.

Interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.

Yeah I think people are scared to jinx it, and they thought the same thing in 2016 then it ended up being like plus 10 for trump.

A little reported, but crazy side effect was harris county went damn near entirely blue. Judges and other county officials based on that vote. Part of the reason tx republicans tried to take away straight ticket voting. 

I’m not optimistic, but it’s definitely a possibility that tx goes blue. High voter turnout in the urban counties is the way it happens. Tx is a sea of red except on the border, and in the cities. If we ever get to where urban vote exceeds rural vote, we’ll go blue
In washington state we had to get a alphabet ranking for your car insurance cost. So A and you got low rates, Z and they would charge an arm or leg? Mine was an X. I don't know how low my actual credit score got, I'm guessing mid 400s probably lower. Basically I had no assets no job and 8-10 maxed out credit cards in default...so whatever that score would be.

Well, at the firm I work for it's $1,700 (CAD) all in to incorporate (legal fees and government filing fees). Then $410 (CAD) a year to be the registered records office.

So If you had the pleasure of paying maple syrup grade fees you'd be out 30% of your capital just setting up. You can however do this all yourself for cheaper but it's still gonna be ~$500 just to get going and then you have to manage your own minutes and stay up to date with reports and regulation changes. If you pay up, your lawyer will stay on top of that for you.

Good bless America though, what a bargain. You aren't in Delaware are you?
If AAPL touches $60 you know we would be doomed and the market would take years to come back up on its feet.

Why would they go down if Biden wins?
Too true, I personally feel like we are dangerously close to that right now. 

Harris doesnt\wouldnt have the support to pull something like that off if Biden kicked the bucket. 

Which is why I'm more partial to her than trumpence.

trump and his supporters self proclaimed want to have him in office more than two terms, combined with the relentless attacks on political rivals troubles me more than the unknown. 

Also, I know that a lot of things are overblown by the media, but the fact that so many underhanded tricks (that haven't been used before ever due to ethics) are being used is more than enough for me.

House prices only go up.. it's because the cost of a mortgage (true cost/APR) is so low, all you need is good credit and you can buy a house.. basically with minimal cost of servicing debt. Statistics show average credit scores are quite high.. thus, house prices go up because the "carry cost" of owning a house via interest rates is so low.

Depends why you’re arguing.

Is it because you’re lazy?
Hey at least you learned something! That's good
Cmon man!
of course, but if that was selling for now reason besides technicals bringing the market back down to its proper valuation. If we're now selling with conviction, we should blow through those technicals. 

Of course its all a guess

Implied Volatility used to not be baked into the price of an option. This played a role. After this volatility skew was introduced. Also it was a time where there were people trading on the floor but also computers so there was some technology discrepancy that led to some people selling off quickly. It was a panic.

Ah gotcha. To my understanding, we are currently in a tech bubble that just popped. Financials have yet to fully recover from the march crash and the only thing pushing the market up was the tech sector. After the FAANG reported their earnings and went down in stock price, it's indicating the beginning of a correction imo.
USING WHAT?

Complain about how hard it is to get a job after college
Holy shit what a comeback
I am going to buy a tremendous amount of amc puts tomorrow
I’m just trying to help but okay lol. If you see spy drop below 322 sell. That’s all.

Buy puts. Go ahead. Right now.
I can file for an LLC with my state for like a hunnid, so... Why would it cost that much?
Kangaroo markets right now, honestly anyone who tells you they know what's gonna happen is overconfident.

My prediction would be flat to mildly green Monday, then red until they announce a winner, and then we consolidate and continue going back up. Another march level crash is highly unlikely IMO but I wouldn't be too surprised by a ~10% correction.

I needed to read that.  Thanks.
Everyone is bearish looking to buy at the bottom. With everyone thinking this way, we already found bottom Friday
that place is the worst
You spent a whole year to make 20%.... $3500.... I think you wasted a lot of time.
I'm voting for the guy that won't shut everything down....hopefully.
Nobody tell him
There are several SPACs I have no commons in, and thousands of warrants. FUSE for example. They have not announced a target yet. Warrants are under $1. Commons are just under $10. I have 9000 warrants and 0 commons.

If they announce a target and it's decent, commons can quickly jump to $12 or so, but warrants would likely jump to over $2. Which would be more than doubling. If the target is garbage, then warrants likely drop below $.50 losing half my investment. It's a gamble. Higher risk higher reward for warrants.
They aren’t even public you nitwit.
No one tell him
yeah thats not how ekgs work bud

Good advice, everyone here gets cocky when futures are up or down .2%, as if it’s not going to to be somewhere else completely by tomorrow morning
Ballsy
What can you do with a political science degree??
LMAO it's at -.4%...
Fuk. Drilling again.
Praying for -3% please 🙏
Tomorrow is gonna be wild!
Great way to start a thetagang account to make great consistent returns. Otherwise you'll have to get up to 2 million before you break 40k per year with these 2-3% dividend etfs. So that'll be like 200 years before you can retire.
You guys got money to hold in there?

Did he invest that 100K..? What was the story, did he win or he lost all?
Is that humour around these parts of Reddit or an actual opinion? I am totally new to finance related subs.
SPY.
I never said the president, I said the administration. Congress doesn't get to write a check until the Director of National Intelligence asks for it.

Basic Civics.

From the same article you linked:

> As former White House counter-terrorism advisor and ABC News consultant  Richard Clarke put it, “never in a million years” would the president be  briefed on what Clarke called such “totally mundane” recruitment  targets. 

Like a president has time to be briefed about every tiny detail of what an intelligence agency is doing with their thousands of agents and hundreds of handlers.

Your grip on reality is proving to be less and less firm as you keep talking.

> it found the CIA was responsible for domestic mail tampering, spying on civil rights leaders, and trials of illegal drugs. 

Oh Lawd they tamperin' with my mail!

So do postal workers. Daily.

Civil rights leaders are watched by default. The less stable ones have a habit of going full retard and becoming terrorists that like to blow things up. It's nice to catch that kind of behavior early.

Drug trials are mundane shit compared to a lot of the other things they've pulled. But really, what's your point?

I guess you conveniently ignored all of that hullaballoo about the FBI having possible intelligence that could have stopped the 9/11 attacks. Does it even register in that smooth little brain of yours as to why that failure was a big deal?

Could it have been because that's what those three agencies are supposed to, and actually do, accomplish on a daily basis?

Maybe the benefits of preventing mass terror and murder upon our population outweigh the few faux pas they've had over their several decade-approaching century-long history?

Stay in your bubble and block me. It's safer there my little snowflake.

27k on spy calls. Ended that trade with 15k. Months ago, out of all the days I picked, I picked a one that would end red.
It was SPX options that expire the day of. If it went up I would be at 70k or so. Instead lost half of it in 5 minutes.

But jk, pretty good job. This is actually a great way to build wealth.
Bunch of investors bought into futures as insurance. If the index went down a couple percentage points, they would short the futures market against their equity positions. So many investors were going short at like -5% that it drove the market down more, making things worse. 

Basically happened cause ppl are dumb.

I had Netflix puts that printed hard like 300% and I didn’t want to be greedy and give it all back to the market straight away 😂 but I knew I should have bought puts at close when I saw this stupid pump 😂
I’m going to need SPY to open green so I can get more puts thanks.
I'm doing that if he wins.

No origination fee from certain providers. \~6% interest (for a student with my statuses, some sites are showing me 4.75%) minus 0.6% on an Ally no-penalty CD. 6 month intended holding time. Gives us a net cost on this of 2.1 - 3% or $300 on $10k.

Risks: 1. Politicians lie. 2. Some required origination date before I took out the loan. 3. Other requirements e.g. bankruptcy.

In thinking of this like an options contract, this bad boy is slayer. 33-1 leverage on a play that has much better than 33-1 odds.

A dumb benefit: I don't currently have any non-credit card loans and the presence of current loans on your credit report boosts your credit score in most scoring models.
You good and you got balls
So this explains all the volatility! I mean, such a wide range of varied outcomes
Futures ripping? Am I seeing the wrong data?

I don't want to be political but if Trump wins, markets mooning just on the simple fact the man in love with Nasdaq and Dow Jones
😨🤢🤮😵
Actual facts, after the Parkland shooting:

Trump responded, saying: “Or, Mike, take the firearms first and then go to court. Because that’s another system, because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early.

Seems like the smart thing to do is to just wait until after the election to make your play. With increased volatility, premiums are more expensive. This is like buying before earnings and hoping for a huge move to offset the the IV crush.
So what do you suggest we do, mighty prophet of fucking stonks??? You must be a millionaire knowing everything that’s going to happen. Fuck it, BILLION TRILLIONAIRE. IM GOING INSANE!!!!

Best part about AMZN puts is you know you're making money taking it from the world's richest man. It's poetic.
Market is going to drill tomorrow just based on the chaos this statement will generate.
Buy puts
RIP oil. Exxon/Shell/BP penny stocks soon?
!remindme tomorrow
You're right. Anything less than a 1% move either way isn't enough to profit off of. However, with the VIX spiking, it allows you a bit longer leash to get out of calls or puts depending. 

But for me, I bought my puts Thursday afternoon, so I'm still in the green right now regardless. If we drop tomorrow even 1% I'm still going to be able to cash out handsomely.

How do you buy puts on oil? (which ticker?)
Oil dropping like March and April lol
Lemme know when you give up because I’ll be switching back to calls.

With the millions of people involved in market trading, I’m going to assume at the very least 1,000 traders place decent sized bets on the market crashing each day. So if 1,000 people are expecting it to crash each day, will it not just because these people are anticipating it?

maybe I'm too naive and hoping in US population could see through him, hoping that his approach to covid, BLM, losing/poking allies overseas & denial of climate change/lack of solutions, etc. would be enough for the general crowd, silent majority to tip the scales towards Biden ... because it about those swing states right?

Winter already got me thinking about calls on $ROPE, fuck this I'm gonna become Florida man
I just think a lot of bears think they win off a -0.5% rn.  -0.8% now it feels like maybe puts breakeven.  I do agree though, wont know till 9:35am
Actually after seeing spy hit new highs during a pandemic I’m not surprised over anything. Especially with 2.4 trillion on the table in stimulus that will make its way into corporations 100%
I’m addicted to this market and this sub but it’s tiring to read this shit when we’ve seen countless times how quickly things change.
Aww... that’s cute.
The weird optimism that there isn’t going to be historically catastrophic political instability over the uncertainty+controversy over election results makes no sense to me
Man I’ve been worried about a trump win, but I can safely sleep now that I know dummies here are long TRMP

When it started paying better
We'll definitely see newer highs but seeing 200 isn't impossible. Personally, I think if we see 350s before seeing 300, the likelihood of 200 will actually increase. If we drop to 300 or below from here, then 280s is probably the lowest we'll go before getting back to all time highs.

Was sorta hoping you were loaded with puts so you'd actually consider sharing some of the profits due to being filthy rich but since you're not, even if 200 happens, I won't see a dime.
MM will not allow for indexes to increase enough or decrease enough. Sell credit spreads
Sure thing, as soon as we make a quick stop at 280
Idk but if Biden wins you better load up on Ammo and an AR if you don’t have one yet. That will become worth more than gold or any other commodity very quick.
Cyborgs in shambles
Hoping for a flat green open to load up on more puts.

I think you need to google warrants and make sure you understand exercise price, cash and cashless redemptions, and intrinsic value. Once you understand those terms/concepts you'll probably be clearer on the topic.

Warrants are dilution though, they're on top of the existing shares.
There also has been numerous accounts of Donald trump rapijg and sexually harassing women as young as 13 yo. Trump's handling with the COVID pandemic has caused us not to get the twlendoes we need, and his overall help on the economy can't even hold a candle to what Reagan or obama did. Trump stated to inject bleach into people's arms, and I dont know about you, but a lot of dead people wouldn't help the economy.
So many gay bears thinking we will not open green. What happened to this sub? When you turned into America hating gay fucks

Because your entire "point" was autistic sperging. Whether Biden is a "true leftist" or not is irrelevant to me, but because you're a self described leftist desperate not to be associated with him, you think it's important. All I care about is the fact that the modern left is totally okay with the Democratic candidate being fully backed by the intelligence agencies, corporate media, and every large tech company. So kindly fuck off.

Okay. Since you're apparently too stupid to use Google on your own, I'm going to just throw links at you and block you. I know you won't read them, so I'm not going to bother waiting for your reply.

The CIA regularly keeps the President in the dark. The President does not sign the CIA's checks, Congress does, and they essentially sign them blank. So right off the bat you've failed basic civics with your non-arguments.

https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/german-spy-scandal-cia-president-dark/story?id=24514155

>Either way, all three former senior officials said it’s up to the CIA’s “good judgment” whether to let the White House in on what one called “pure espionage.”

The Rockerfeller Comission was the last major formal investigation into CIA activities in the USA. Among other things, it found the CIA was responsible for domestic mail tampering, spying on civil rights leaders, and trials of illegal drugs.

Wow man.
"Green by open you stupid bears," the bull typed. The salty aroma of its stream of tears mixed with the odor of its excrement, a nasty reminder of the raw fear it feels. "Wsb is bearish. Ya gotta inverse." The bull barely had the mental capacity to type that sentence, let alone believe it. Too poor to afford $ROPE after mindlessly buying every dip presented to it, death would provide no escape from the poverty within which it trapped itself. Drifting slowly into a depression slumber, the bull feebly down votes every remotely bearish comment, no matter how inane.

You think Trump has any control over it now?
given both candidates are 1%ers with money tied up in the market doesn't it make sense for both of them to not contest the election too hard and have a normal transition, irrespective of who wins?

From my Swedish friend: they don't need to mandate or enforce things because people in Sweden follow recommendations just because it's the culturally swedish things to go with the flow and not be an asshole.
You won’t.

Time to head up to the bar and act drunk, so I can hustle hardcore Cowboys fans out of their drinking money. 


Shhhh. Pepe is an imposter.
Who knows but I'd consider selling some if it drops near 400. If entire market crashes, Zoom should continue to drop so if that's case, maybe hold out for 300.
My RSU about to vest in just a few days...I need the stonks to go up again!
look up US500 for spy and US100 for nasdaq (us30 dow)
Yes
I mean, yeah.. that's definitely part of it.
YOU TRADE LIKE OLD PEOPLE FUCK. GET OUT OF MY OFFICE YOU FUCKING TOSSER.

Prediction  UVXY EOW ?
Had 2 minutes of happiness as a bull on friday now right back to the pain factory
These must be new bears in this thread.  All the old bears were blown up June-early September.

Word of advice, don’t fight JPOW.
What time does Europe start?
Buy calls?
Don’t even act surprised that we’re dropping Bitch
please jesus, no
Enjoy the moment bears because for the next 18 hours it's going to keep getting worse and worse

You think -1% is a home run but you are to get humbled when you wake up to find it uno reversed you into +1%
To be completely honest I yoloed $50000 into uxvy Friday at open to make up for a 5% loss. It will prob be up tomorrow but Idk when to seek for profit haven’t had much luck with that lately
Thursday night futures were down -1.98% and spy closed the day almost green. It’s way too early to say how this is going to finish.
tradingview is delayed by 10 minutes.. use investing.com
We won’t know the results immediately. The GOP is going to try and do a repeat of Bush in 04
And that’s the dip
yep - blood red by open
I don’t think it will ever happen. Market will recover, go to newer highs (eventually), and future crashes won’t drop enough to go all the way back to 200.
Confinement is coming back to effect very very soon, maybe not in America but in Europe for sure. I'm expecting a really big drop before December, February at max. depending on how (slow) America reacts. QQQ looks extended to hell, that is, until a few days ago, the rumbling started...

Big yikes. Try to unplug over the weekends and enjoy life a little. Easier said than done, I know.
One week of red won't be enough. Need to shake out RH millennials and weak hands from market. So many people bought stocks during the crash thanks to 'buy the fear' mentality courtesy of that dinosaur Buffett. 

Double dip crash is needed. Dead cat bounce to trap deluded bulls, then a crash which will see SPY back at 280.

Eh he's had little use for the market as of late, imo. He's been all about his crowds and stands to gain more from political attacks and riling up his base.

Uncertainty will only get higher as we go, Nobody will be buying on Tuesday and everyone will be dumping stocks, just my prediction

Roses are red violets are black,

Poor or rich 1%?
Futures are flat so we can buy more puts at open.  Crash postponed until 10 minutes after open.

As long as the economy is trending up, which it is, then so will the market.

Look at bonds, they’re not going up, that divergence should tell you that this looks nothing like March.

All the downvotes confirm I’m right. Same amount of downvotes the last week of March that I warned the bears to cover and we were about to head up. I’m jacked. I’M JACKED TO THE TITS!!!
It dipped a shit ton Friday and I expect the broader market sell off to continue probably at least until Election Day so I’d say your Gucci

> I have no words for how fucking stupid and easily manipulated you are. 

Don't use words, use facts. Unless you don't have any, in which case you're doing just fine.

> With the unquestioned support of both Democrat and Republican administrations,  

No. All of the legislation undermining your civil rights and privacy was written by republicaqns, and passed by republican administrations.

It's literally right there. Written in the history of our nation. Can't miss it.

> I can't tell if you're naive enough to actually think this, or just disingenuous enough to ignore history and spew lies anyways. 

So you think they write their own paychecks?

This is nice, keep going.
Bulls celebrate faster than they cum

The same reason I won't be a Bear is the same reason why I don't bet against my favorite sports team.  It's a conflict of interest like hoping for the downfall of American and betting that it happens.  I'm probably going to be downvoted to hell for this but.  All you Bears rooting for VIX hate America, Capitalism and Democracy. You want a contested election because you are selfish and don't care about the health of the US economy and global competiveness in the long term.  The best thing for this country right now is to find compromise between the sides and you want to rip it apart and profit while it happens.

TBH I think the above guy is actually a "Transwoman porn" watcher. I did studies on porn (gay,lesbian,trans). Typically normal men do not think like this. I found it common among the the transwomen porn lovers. It is a typical defense they do as a way of self-deflecting and usually they are very closeted about they transwomen porn interest.
I can't imagine that Trump will allow the day before the election to be a bloodbath. Not good for him
Futures are now tanking.
Same here. I think I might actually sell some stuff Monday.
Free money for options sellers
30 mins ago when futures opened: hmm this isn't so bad.

Now: reeeeeeeeee

Yes because Obama printed more than trump, Google it don't @ me
Genuinely curious why you think tues will be worse than monday
Imagine if you Inversed that?
Stfu
you pay the ask , seller gets bid thats the 3rd way brokers make money. The other 3 that you didnt ask for are: 

1.comissions

2.intrest on your leveraged positions

4. OTC gain (the buy the shit the sell you at a different price)
Isn’t buying SPY strangles/straddles Tuesday before close free money? Or am I retarded?
I got some 322/318p debit spreads and sold some 318/314p credit spreads.

what makes you think we're getting the results tuesday night
But if your not directly purchasing warrants then the risk is removed other than the share price being determined post merger. Roughly 22 warrants for 100 shares, even if they went worthless its not like you lost money because you still have shares. But i guess if pre merger the price of shares and warrant price get pumped and you held through merger and excitement fizzled out thats similar to Iv crush. Just kinda thinking out loud if the warrants are secondary to the shares, why not hold out since they are essentially “free” and become more valuable overtime. If you can double your profits by exercising the warrants and selling the shares why not do whatever it takes to raise the capital to exercise since you can pay back whatever loan you took upon cashing out the shares.

Preach it dude, what the fuck right

Every week you see AAPL holders bragging they bought the dip, you know it's going to keep dropping.
Yeaaaa forget tomorrow, Tuesday is going to be bloody as fuck
Agreed, it's such an antiquated policy. Just remove it, it was intended for farmers and shit back in the day and no longer matters.
It's entertaining at least tho.
So happy having 50% in cash. I’m so ready to buy in the next 2-4months

Yes, yes you are. Do you have some more autistic screeching about "true leftism", or have you tired yourself out?
Oh ok bull r now fuk
Yup, after the dumping last week and a Biden landslide, gonna be a hella green week.
Y’all realize that we will drill for the next 2 weeks or so. We are not finding out our president on the third. It will drill till then
Lmao
Buy low sell high, or short high cover low, or sit on my hands.
Pretty sure they rallied it EOD friday specifically to do all the dumping when people can't buy/sell their options, over the weekend.

they sorta dicks like that
Nice. Wiped out at open. Why did I ever start buying calls?
I need at least 2% in either direction
Soooooo bulls? Any words?
They are going to drop like a rock, say 5%+ so they will be cheap, cheap, cheap buys. There were attacks in Iraq, late last week, and they halted all oil exports (second largest OPEC exporter). These countries will literally go to war over the price of oil or non compliance, in Iraq’s case. There will be massive layoffs and limited supply thus driving up the price of a barrel of oil.
Bloody monday. Gonna take a celebratory shit brb.
The stimulus in Dec or Jan and falling unemployment will keep us from a recession. The market is forward looking and knows this. You should be too and not blindly following short term trends. 

As long as the economy is trending up, which it is, then so will the market.

Look at bonds, they’re not going up, that divergence should tell you that this looks nothing like March.
That's... why I'm here
Just wait until Europe markets open
What's that sound? Sounds like.... Can it be?! 

It's the drills!
Missed getting puts on that gap up eod fuk. Wonder if I can still scalp puts tomorrow
I cant wait! Hopefully 95 endweek would be nice.
It’s fucking AWESOME
Love a nice gap down sometimes (when I’m cash)

It’s not MY fault the market is about to crash

Futures will dump hard once Europe opens. FTSE futes down 1.5% and DAX futes down .86%. It’s been 42 minutes since they opened, insane
Yes friend but it’s global. It’s used primarily as a hedging tool.
Do you mean fate
Oh Lawd here she goes
it's drilling already

It is, but 24h futures start trading at 6pm Sunday. Haven't found that a very reliable indicator of what is to come.
Haha very
Ay chill..
Yeah gimme a circuit breaker open then shoot up 20% so everyone wins
God bless you sir
they better leave some dumping for tomorrow
Probs. If I was able to control futures I would probably just make it look like a normal day and bait retail into something before playing my cards.
Narrator: he didn’t
Houston, we have a problem

Futures has too much period. Tampons needed
How tf did you do this and take a screenshot?  That’s really impressive.
Its called stroopwafel
They are pumping like mad men
I’m going to ride it on the way up first, or try to. Glad to see it sold off so I’m not buying top but going to wait until election stuff is sorted out.

no better feeling than releasing endorphins after a good workout. losing life savings on FDs comes close however
another sell off tuesday before close right?
No matter who wins the market will continue to crash. There may be a few days to a week after that it rallies, but it’ll keep going down. Look at every major crash in the past 90 years. There’s the ATH, the drop, then an attempt to go back up, followed by a larger crash
That’s not a healthy graph
I never held puts through circuit breaker before. Maybe tomorrow I’ll know what it feels like
Someone has a gambling addiction
This hurts
My bull brothers, if you want to play next week, make sure you at least hedge your positions.
Yeah that’s why I sold my puts on Friday but now I regret not buying back back at close🤦🏻‍♂️
where do you think aapl will be eoy
GIVE ME TENDIES OR GIVE ME DEATH
Not yet
Remember on Thursday when futures were down 2.4% and we opened barely down 0.5%? Calls and puts are fuck. We open flat again boys.
Wow bulls really r fuk huh
>why rich people don't want Biden

I guess someone forgot to tell Hollywood.
Futures should be illegal.... they decide your faith without you being able to sell
Would prolly stop at Sep. lows
Similar to the bull fa66ots that were literally downvoting every comment on Friday from like 3:15 to close? I smell hypocrisy.

You’re an idiot
For people expecting a sell of why would there be one when most company have beaten their earnings estimates during ER. Unless we have something that can change that for next q, like US lock down or election uncertainty & unrest then we will see a true sell off
Because you don't believe it will ever happen or because you're loaded with puts?

"Ever" is a long ass time.
Real talk though, anyone who is a complete degenerate like me and constantly watches futures knows that activity on sunday night is usually pretty anticlimactic. It's usually fairly flat until late in the evening.

This is pretty ominous.

Yes, bleed. These are the futures I came here to see
That's what I'm hoping for, I bought puts at 3:59

Biden win, good odds but not assured for the last few weeks. 

Biden win+Blue senate could never really be priced in. But might be really close to a reality come Tuesday night.

I mean given where futures are puts is the obvious choice.  Even if it could easily finish green with red futures (obviously futures aren't the end all be-all of market open), it's still at least somewhat more likely to finish red.
You guys both won congrats

The only news I could find is due to decrease in supply with things shutting down again but doesn't seem like big enough news for oil to fall 5% so quickly.

I have no words for how fucking stupid and easily manipulated you are. Maybe look into Obama's various Defense Authorization Acts if you really believe this.

>they've been working on the foundation for almost two decades now

With the unquestioned support of both Democrat and Republican administrations, secretly, regardless of the constitution. And now every single "ex CIA analyst" is on CNN talking up Biden. But yeah, go on about the conservative boogeyman.

>the CIA only does what the politicians tell it to

I can't tell if you're naive enough to actually think this, or just disingenuous enough to ignore history and spew lies anyways.

I don't want to have this conversation with you, because you've proven you're the type of dumb fuck who's fine with the government taking as much authoritarian power as it wants while "your side" is in power and then acts fucking shocked when it's used against you every time. You aren't worth having a conversation with.

SPY 324p 11/2 am i fuk
That sounds terrible..
no, at the time they rolled over the contracts and the spot price drop from 18 to -42 or so.

I dont trade the spot at all if there is risk of delivery, which why oil went negative.

Also the financially settled contracts closed positive, with the physical contracts closed negative.
so it would been pretty hard to for me to even scalp the financially settled instruments.


The next day, I got word that Bloomberg, and IB were dumping contracts and then we saw spot got from 18 to 9, back up to 18.

That was a good short trade day too

Oil was pretty fun then.
Which one

Im pretty sure buddy's account got hacked. Look at all his liked tweets it's ALL pro Trump anti Biden nothing else. You really think Burry seems like the type of guy to give a fuck about Twitter?

I mean, same with Biden winning. It's been leaning that way for a while, but full European lockdowns will tank the crude price until production is cut back.
I can’t tell why it is going down but its going down is news that seems significant to me.  It is possible that it is just following a trend and I am ok with that.

* Metals flat
* VIX: +2.44%
* Index futures: all down approx -0.50%

There’s still earnings right?
The fact that it jumped so fast makes tonight's futures more likely to crash tho.
don't believe retards
Yeppp.  Selling puts and far OTM condors is what i rolled with for this week and next. Figured the market will hold it back this week so that my sold calls wont go bust. Trying to get that sweet premium.

I was playing calls for the longest, but these drops kept eating some of my gains. Had to change it up. And amazon is hella expensive to play

I disagree. I actually think there is a lot of value in BA relative to other stocks. It’s a balanced company that is half military and half commercial aviation. Yes the messed up on the 787 software, but from a technology standpoint, no one is close to having a competitive plane. In the near term, they are getting killed bc both airlines struggling and everyone thinks Biden is getting elected (bad for defense spending)
i have a feeling they will crush earnings and people will say "why was this red for 90 days in a row" but who knows

Those lockdowns were as predictable as winter happening. Why not priced-in?
Futures rose after the stock market closed at 4:00. The larger number is in reference to where the futures session closed at. The lower number is in reference to where the indices closed at. Right now SPX implied open is like -3 or so

Knew all of that and much more before I was old enough to legally drink, which was probably while you were still in diapers.

The NSA is harmless, the biggest problem with them is that conservatives are eventually going to pass legislation allowing the huge amount of data they warehouse to be used to create a totalitarian police state. They've been working on the foundation for almost 2 decades now.

The CIA only does what the political administration asks it to. You got a problem with them fucking with central America and the Middle East, look at who was giving them orders.

That's not all they do, I'm very aware of that. My point is the run up from buybacks and the 0% interest rates can only do so much. Infinite Fed is not a thing, it never was, and never will be. It's completely foolish to think they have complete control over the economy and markets to keep us from a recession. But you'll learn the hard way....
Are vxx calls too obvious for them to print? Bought them cause I didn’t wanna grab anything else. Want to flip at Tuesday close

280s would be my first target if I were to buy puts. I have much lower targets but should be a pretty decent bounce once it gets into the 280s before maybe dropping more but who knows.
Thanks just took a look. I'm not sure I understand it, despite the volatility on Friday if you purchased at 6am UK time before the open you would have made a loss at close?
So is Investing.com the right data? Futures are taking a beating there yet Yahoo Finance and CNBC are flat.

It’ll take time to build credit for your business.  With any new business, creditors require PG’s (personal guarantees) to gain credit and leverage.  Additionally, your business needs to show income and that’s shown via a tax return.  You’ll need to file annual reports and minutes for the corporation.  All can be done yourself.

Nobody cares about some European r/sandersforpresident dropout whining about "no true leftism". That's not the point being discussed.
It’s like putting paper machete on the titanic after the hull splits open. Like yeah it’ll float. For a minute
Holy shit, it actually happened. It's over.

lol down .5% 20 minutes into futures trading. I said selloff not blip
I’m selling my short dated puts at open.  The Fed has made an official announcement yet.

Okay, now what?
I'm sure that must not be his full portfolio. I am sure he is hedging with $ROPE
remember when baba was 200
I don't mind if it goes down now but it's gone down so much already that puts is on the risky side at the moment, at least for me. Personally, I think we'll see SPY 200 eventually, just don't know when.
Why? What would've happened twenty years ago?
Worldwide a sea of red futures, I can now sleep(ut) comfy, goodnight my gay bears mwah
Easily going down based just on more lockdowns around the world.
Asia still buys us equities
No, that was just hear say.  This article confirms it is actually happening.
Imagine thinking an island in Europe going on lockdown would affect futures
Can’t argue with 🤡 logic

I’m scared for this sub they sound like they’re stupidly over leveraged and praying for a miracle
Timber bitches. Grab your nutsacks!
330s is my guess for the next bounce. Down to 310s, up to 330s, down to 280s.
whether you want a circuit breaker or a green dildo you can find enough idiots on here to back you up. could be green or red by open but one things for sure, we’ll all be disappointed

Thank you for calling to attention to all of us how smooth of a brain you have. The Fed no longer means shit, buying bonds and ETFs can only buy this weak economy so much time.
Imagine if you could see yourself in third-person in social interactions. I'd probably cringe to death

Green by opeN

Red by close
+550 to -16,000. Nice 👍🏽
Would not getting way OTM options on basically any leveraged VIX fund be retarded af right now? Seems to me like no matter who wins there’s gonna be some large amounts of uncertainty as both sides are gonna go crazy and could lead to huge volatility.

Right... or am I retarded?
I’m think of going long on BABA, just because the dumb statement of “well If AMZN can get to 3k BABA can do at least a 1/3rd of that.” ($990)
Nope just people getting in at a good price before an oil push. Plus Libya is overproducing right nkw
Tell that to March
Which is what will happen
I think it was 44 down to 30, I remember going short on close and Sunday night I was up 14K per contract.

That was a good day.
. 5%, not .05%
Show us your positions where you capitalized on said obvious crash
Or you could just add a line (- + - = +)

How about 190 and then 350? Make bank on puts going down, go all in calls and make bank going up? Why doesn’t everyone want this?
There’s a reason they call you a retard

That’s the greatest thing about options. You can profit regardless. It’s just the perma bears who get hard at the idea of a major travesty that are really fucked in the head

How many of you just honestly shake your head and roll your eyes and think how can people be that naive when you see bears talking about their doomsday prophecies?
What do you want us to do with all the money? Worst case scenario, we'll just buy reits or switch to reits.
Every time I buy a put we start a fucking face ripping rally dude. I get fucked on boths sides I even get fucked on theta I just suck at this shit so bad

“Euro is done dumping” hahahah
So our futures down Bigley!
Fucking excellent. I’ve had puts on the S&P based on all the short term headline risk going into election but I’m smart enough to have been buying the fucking dip for the last few days. 

How you doing?
We go based on Asia and Europe markets they can buy and sell US stock... do you know how futures work?
Use it to replace some of your previous losses
Did you forget the fact that the NSA didn't officially exist for most of it's existence, that it spies on Americans, that the CIA was HUGE into drug running and has couped most of Latin America and the Middle East, and that the only reason we know any of this is leaks and whistleblowers that the modern """left""" dismiss as "evil Rooskies"? These are the "intelligence communities" that CNN uses as infallible sources of truthiness.

It's bizzaro world McCarthyism. And you're dumb enough to buy it.
Man if TSLA drops some more it’s gonna be lookin JUICY. I mean it’s already lookin good but another $30 would be saweeeeet
take oil as a leading indicator, also there is a pumping war going on
mmm, more buying opportunities
It was me, I said it!
Why choose when we can get one in each color at the end of the week
Be careful with those longer term though. If Biden gets elected, there are going to be a lot of Democrats unloading their guns and ammo on the used market, which will depress prices for a while, since almost everybody has already stocked up, and ammo prices have gotten ridiculous.
That seems like a simple explanation for this past Friday. But it doesn't explain most Fridays.
If a big crash is really going to happen like so many people are saying it will, I hope SPY climbs back up to 350s first.

The SPY who killed me...
As a retard with 1/15 30c this retarded DD gave me hope. Sort of... believing in a case for long term viability so I’ve loaded in shares but it’s more of a hedge if the contract dies. The squeeze originally sounded likely/soon but projections/likelihood keep moving back.
Do I sell my remaining. Scraps of portfolio and wait for a stable trend ? Or do I keep gamboling weekliez
[deleted]
they also extended limit up and limit down on the indexes from 5% to 7%

Sometimes I wonder what the fuck are you guys smoking talking about futures. One comment will be circuit breaker tomorrow and I’ll check investing and there’s a .05% drop in any of the futures indices.

It's psychological for me at this point, I need to get over how hard I got fucked by this market when it rallied so hard after march after every ounce of common sense said there was no reason for it.

DUMBASSES SPY IS ONLY DOWN .02% ITS FLAT. Learn where you get your info
Damn what a rush
Remember: you have a few hours left to withdraw cash money from the bank. Your broker can only legally margin call you after 9:30 am.
More like a cow market
Bulls depend on the Fed completely lol. Without the Fed bulls would be broke asf. Just boomers helping boomers
With 0 day to expiration options it does. Insane to do it with anything with more time. 1.50 or more intraday movement in spy happens a majority of the time. You could hope for a 2% green or down day, but all you should be hunting for is spy moving past $1.50 or more in a given direction. That translates to a less than 1% movement.
This is actually the worst thing to see if you have calls. Futures barely red. Means it has all fucking night to bleed down and be down 1-2 percent by open. I’d prefer it to be actual blood red right now so it has 15 hours to just slowly recover by open
Nah it was fucking negative back in March. We'll have to wait but this isn't that bad.
https://i.imgur.com/epAUezS.png

Brrrrr is factually over.

Stimulus = brrrrr. Congress controls the money printer, not the fed. The fed's powers are limited to cutting interest rates and capitalizing banks that are on the verge of failure.

Attaching JPow's face to that famous money printer meme video was a clever sleight of hand that made people irrationally exuberant.
TA isn't horsecrap, but the way it's being used here is. TA's used to understand market psychology. The longer term you use it for, the worse/more invalid it gets.

Depends on what the market does. If it just goes up, probably not. If we tank hard, yes.
Thanks mum
/VX is up 55 cents so far tonight.
That's what you get for signing all cansucks players
exactly
Their price is wrong. /es is down 1.75

Edit: it seems some places calculate the change differently. It’s down 1.75 from where the futures were priced at 4:00 when the indicies closed. But they continued to go up after hours before the Friday future session ended. So from that price, the larger drop you see is correct.
No but you have to understand, they feel it this time

Well boys, the calls are in.  God speed
From CME website:

>Crude oil product circuit breakers

>Our Energy markets have dynamic circuit breakers, which means the range in which prices can move is reset continuously on a rolling 60-minute lookback window. If markets move +/- 15% in that time, a 2-minute halt is initiated.

Both, you can play a straddle. 

Same strike and expiration.
Flat
Iv crush bro
Straddles  make no sense for daytrading. Not to say you can't make money with them but if you are telling me, you KNOW there is going to be a big move on the underlying, but you have no idea which way? Not buying it.
I think it goes down to 3245-3240 and then bounces
Hell yes, day trading rules, but that's not what we were discussing.  When someone says, "futes don't matter" in these threads, they're usually in a position that has concerns with the direction of trend / price being higher or lower than pervious days / weeks.  However, when we're talking about scalping a few points of of /ES, /NQ, SPY, whatever during the day, then the Globex session truly doesn't matter; the ATR on any given day will yield plenty of opportunities.  

So, if you're day trading and not swing trading (not the Al Brooks definition, but the more widely accepted on), why would it occur to you to say, "..futures rarely matter..."?  I'm not bustin' on you, I'm just curious.
Vix is ripping but futures are flat? Is this a foreshadow? Is vix teasing us?

Me
That milk will be cheese well paired to your whining, while I'm ridin with biden
Gaps always close except on the eve of war
yes
I’d agree with you if this was 2 months ago but with the weekend lockdown news, 1 day before elections, no stimulus talks until after the election, no positive vaccine news = Red Week in my opinion. If I’m wrong so be it

Markets love stability so much, they'll love Biden, even if he increases taxes
Imagine not panic selling all your shares and helping print my puts lmao
Puts on me not giving a flying fuck lolllll

All Europe’s fault
News of lockdowns + lower oil demand making this feel a little like march in here
Barley futures dipping in London post market. This is usually a leading indicator, Monday will be 🩸 🩸 🩸
can oil futures go negative??
Futures more interesting to watch than mayweather jr vs mcgregor
Imagine thinking you know how the cash market is going to open based on Sunday night futures before Japan even opens. 🤡
Its gonna go inside out tomorrow
Bears too
anyone else waiting till after election to buy LEAPs?
What about tuesday? Can you check your crystal ball. Thanks bb.

Sorry bulls but tomorrow is your only hope for a bounce. If tomorrow dumps then u have no hope for a pre election bounce, absolutely nobody is going to be buying the day before a possibly contested election that could result in civil unrest and the possibility of the election not even being finished by Wednesday. U r fuk

Oh hey there. That's right it's me Robinhood's Vlad Tenev. I know you told me not to come around here. I know after you lost control of your account for 48 hours you said you would never buy another position again. At least let me plead my case. Did you know that Robinhood is the perfect broker?

My favorite part of this sub is the fact they think the futures, after being open for 12 minutes, is going to accurately predict tomorrow's market. If it were that fucking easy literally no one would lose money and everyone would be in the stock market.
Literally been 8 min when you posted this you retard
Don't talk about her like that you slag

Good. Night 🌈🐂

Don't be a naive 🤡

Rest in pieces🔥💵
The point is that the 'unholy alliance of intelligence agency spooks, big tech and corporate media' is totally in character and not at all a contradiction, because Obama and now Joe have always been representatives of the establishment, prosecuting the likes of Edward Snowden... 

Spare me the parochialism and relativism, you're a tard if you think Joe Biden is a 'supposedly leftist candidate'
Check again lololol
Y’all forget that if the market stalls even with the printer running at full speed that al of that money kinda just evaporates from the markets. See 1929
Tbf you didn't realise bojo would lock us sillynannies down
What oil news exactly? Shut downs?
He's drunk
I'm actually very excited if I can keep this momentum or get a couple of lucky red days, I will find myself with 100k by end of year.

What is crude ticker symbol? November or December?

I am not exactly sure what the bulls are celebrating lmfao

I'd get you those colourblind shades but I spent all my money on puts
.5% in 10 minutes is a pretty solid drop. But could be even by open 🤷🏻‍♂️
Do you think it will get that low?
Oil down over 3% on growing concerns over demand, especially in Europe after the announcement of lockdowns. US WTI $34.47 and Brent $36.52 a barrel.

https://twitter.com/RonnieChopra1/status/1323039998489362432
Whew no gap down. My calls still have a chance
Time to start selling OTM puts on some tech I’d like to own.
Should of seen this coming when oil was done 3% on Friday but OXY was up a lot tomorrow it’ll be 7.
We're really not red til sub 3250 on /ES btw. A giant short covering rally in the last 10 minutes isn't the real close.
Mostly Cubans there. Cubans know a thing or two about socialist regimes, which is why they inverse that.
Bears fucked! Idc about spy just make SLV moon
Glad I yolo’d on shares instead
True autist buying puts after a big dip
What SPY is still above 240? 450 EOW confirmed

I don't know which direction the market is going to go but if it goes up, we'll see mid 350s. If we go down, I think we could see mid 280s. Good luck.

Just realized if you take the vowels out of Bear it spells Br, which is the same sound Jpows printer makes. 

Not sure what to make of this yet, will report back after my quant finishes crunching the numbers.
Wait and go longer at $69
Imagine cruise lines, airlines, gyms, and even movie theaters deploying this. If this is as good and fast as promised, so long lockdowns.
Ok, you’re a retard
What kind of peanuts are you rolling with? These tiny numbers don't even get my dick hard
10 hours til pre-market...
It drops to 89 I’m loading up on shares and calls.
So the oil market is pricing in a Biden win.
Wrong sub. 
BAN.
11-20 will go down in history just wait
Flat like my girlfriend
Down futures = morning run up and overall "green" day.

Run up futures = green morning, red eod.

From what I've noticed at least. I expect we either have a volatile red day tomorrow or election day, or end of the week. I can imagine at these prices from last week being bad we will see some buying into those stocks.
That is what she said.
Time to hedge back on AIDS maybe? /s
Futures pretty meaningless but the oil news makes me think my SLB and XOM shorts are going to be good.
Flat day confirmed. Puts and calls will both be fucked as the ultimate middle finger

Lmao nah I'm holding like...3 calls rn. Like literally 3 contracts. Too much risk this weekend.

But VIX is spiked due to election, and is the annualized implied move either down OR up
Pretty optimistic for a 10% bump this week of all weeks. 

May be a Green Day in there you can sell for a profit to one of these other retards though
!remindme 4 days

Bulls r so fucked
Thanks for the tip.  Will do.
Going long at $89 AAPL
Not nearly as red as I thought it was going to be. Bullish.

**CIRCUIT BREAKER**
Yeah, a lot of corners of reddit are still full of idiots who still don't understand why rich people don't want Biden. Including here
If it's obvious, then it's definitely going to happen. Have you even looked at the charts? It's a double top clear as day, it's such a clean double top that it's probably going to be printed in future college textbooks for just how perfect it looks.

why the hell did I not load up on puts
Money  ≠  intelligence or wisdom. Neither does having an MD.
I got $10 on Trump to win and a $5 on a bunch of blue states being red. If he loses my portfolio is fucked anyway. I can't hedge with Biden it goes against my principals. NEVER HEDGE YOLO
Do it.  You can cashflow the savings into trades.
Everyone waiting on Europoors must think they don’t know how to price things in right ?
Are you watching!!!! Es??? I'm excited as f÷$k
I screwed that up real bad, but I've changed. You gotta believe me that I changed. I'm simply copy and pasting too much. I'm probably writing too much DD and working too hard.
Solid gap down for a Sunday
Bulls see a bear market slow down temporarily as it’s dropping and get the audacity to say “bers fukd”
Holding $20k of 11/4 spy puts bought at 324 eod right before that pump that put them at about -30%
-2% by midnight
Yeah that’s called shorts covering. We are going down Bigly this week.
Not for the past 3 weeks.
Just in case, SPY is he (not she)
That means it's tendie time for the bears boys

Lmao 90% is this sub bought the most “obvious” level of support and are going to get train wrecked this week. Literally short every bounce. You just saw every earnings get beat the fuck down and sold off and Europe is a dumpster fire. Covid third wave rhetoric and a contested election with nobody knowing if or when stimulus will be passed. Dollar going vertical and everything is risk off.
Since I started this method, 15k. I used to trade intra day dips and built my account to 45k. Lost 12k when I found myself catching a knife. I only enter 3k-5k since making 1-2k, 2 days a week (usually Wednesday is the 5-10% profit day) is nothing to laugh at. I managed to push fomo away since I hate thinking if I had dropped 40k on this I would be at 100k by the end of the week, that mindset cost me too much money.
You don’t know shit you gay human

Unlikely this week. Too much uncertainty for a solid rebound. Not a bad play post election though if it starts to run.

EDIT: I would also avoid jumping in on a short term call if it bounces for one day. Wait for a multi-day run and buy something that's >21 DTE. Just my two cents.
Sorry my bad, down 1.20% now

No plays to be made. Breweries and distilleries don't just double their sales overnight. Breweries pretty much run at capacity with little headroom to increase output and distilling is a slow process. Jim Beam isn't going to start cracking open barrels that were put up this spring to put in their bottles labled as having aged for 4 years.

Their gains are priced in, they can't moon.

For my entire life every time a presidential election comes up the "other side" says "he is going to make himself a dictator!"

Then it doesn't happen.

The reason is that the whole entire system, top to bottom, is set up to transition that power to the winner. It's been doing it for like 200 whatever years and it's quite good at it. To overcome that would require a shift of tectonic proportions.

And while i think Trump will be a bad sport about it I don't think he will actually try to break the system to stay in power. In fact, the only way to *really* do that is the call for active violence, close to him. He would need trumpers to storm the capitol. Do you think this man *really* wants that?
ill take that bet

This is weak sauce

Cheap meals? Try this:

1 head of cauliflower, riced in a blender
1 can diced tomatoes
1 can black beans
1-2 cans chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
2-3 cloves of garlic
1 beef bouillon cube and 125ml water

Literally just dump all that shit in a pot, bring to boil, simmer for 20 min.

You have a delicious, low carb, beans and veggie dish that will keep all week, be good for a week's worth of lunches, go with whatever meat you want to eat it with (or fill you up if meat isn't on the menu), and is cheap as shit. You barely need to add any seasoning, because the adobo sauce does a lot of the heavy lifting, flavour wise.
Think people might start buying now that we didn't limit down circuit break
Where do u guys watch futures??
Lmao at this mini pump attempt. Limit down by 9 am

down 18 handles
That’s what I’m thinking. When the bulls go gay we know things are going green.
Remember guys market opens at 8:00 tomorrow. Easy math 🤓
I bought more Friday before close. It's never too late to hedge your portfolio and get closer to delta-neutral. (Something I should've already done, but hey, this is WSB.) Puts are now expensive so I'm not going crazy.

IMO, last week's 5% SPY drop already prices in general uncertainty for this event. But, if the next month involves a contested election battle, there's 5-15% further downside risk. (Bank of America's research note gave me that figure.)

Be ready to switch to buying though if a winner is clear on Wednesday.
1 minute till we all fuk
I'm ready to be poor.

Does anyone know what it's called when you hate being questioned, generally think you're better than everyone, and if you were put in charge, things would be VERY different around here?
Are you ready? Are you?
Bid ask are already down before open.
This is dumb. There's an easier way.  
  
1. Buy a lotto ticket  
  
2. Build that box thing that Schrodinger's cat would sit in, but make it big enough for you.  
  
3. Write a program that scans the lotto ticket, comparing its numbers to the winning lotto numbers. If the numbers don't match, poisonous gas is released into the box. If the numbers do match and the ticket is a winner, no gas is released.  
  
4. A few hours before the numbers are released, climb into the box and sedate yourself.  
  
5. Assuming the Many Worlds Interpretation is correct, every version of you that bought a losing lotto ticket will die in your sleep. So when you wake up, you'll be the version of you that bought a winning lotto ticket.  
  
6. Cha-ching! Profit.
About 10000 to 1
They re-released it.

I see one very large gamble on overstock that seems to have paid off. I’m sure there were others. You also seem to have a high paying job at a young age. Good for you. Seriously I wish I was you. I chose medicine instead of software engineering or computer science. Probably biggest mistake I’ve made in my life. I enjoy both. You’re understanding of how the healthcare sector works is small though. Seems like you’ve got a lot of fingers in a lot of baskets. That’s good but also makes you far from an expert in any of them. Honestly, I value that you’re young and trying to branch out though. That’s how success is made. I’d love to hear your ideas on ML in healthcare.

I also agree with you that ML will adjunct physicians at some point. Right now radiology is the field experimenting the most with it. Anything to speed us up is helpful. Emergency medicine is another that has potential. The whole hospital is a lofty goal. It’s a huge organization with tons of moving parts. Physicians usually know just the bear minimum of what other physicians in other specialties do because it is so complex. Not to mention the nurses and techs who also have immense knowledge in their respective fields. You may reduce the number of physicians needed with ML but more than likely it will just make the ones who are older and can’t use or refuse to use the technology obsolete. I’d be curious to know what companies you’ve been looking at or investing in though. Even just in the research stage is interesting but clinical medicine usually lags about a decade or more behind the research. It’s just how it is. It has to be peer reviewed and verified and proven over and over because people’s lives are at stake.

It's possible. If the senate stays republican they might try to hang on as hawks. But, with covid crawling up all the asses in America it's going to be tough to hold that line.

If it flips Dem then they only need 10 republicans on board. Or they can just change the senate rules, you know because it's a fucking emergency, and pass stimmy by majority rather than supermajority.

There are a whole bunch of trapped traders on both sides of price for SPY500 / Emini futures / ES1! which will want to exit, giving us a trade in opposite direction (yellow zones)  
Beware of the engineered liquidity zones - which are almost like a candy land for big institutions - where orders are just sitting to be taken! Those zones WILL BE poked poked! (green zones)  
Good luck & good trading for the election week!  


Please note : the zones shown here are for reference purpose only. Actual buy & sell zones should be fine tuned with a lower timeframe reference & more detailed analysis.

Would love your feedback!

You aren't going to be able to get any large amount of credit for a bit, so you won't be starting a business or buying a house or even a car. So if you wanted to do those things you have to wait until your credit recovers. If you just wanted to party and do drugs like I did then it doesn't really effect you that much at all. I did end up getting evicted and arrested eventually and my girlfriend dropped me like a sack of bricks so it does have consequences. I imagine if I had printed instead, I just would have had a bigger habit, I would be married and and I would have some nice loss porn to show off.

She was a prosecutor who hid evidence to convict black men and now wants to reform police. She wanted to spend more than any other candidate in the primaries and is now supposedly a moderate. She has no platform, no morals, and no actual beliefs. She didn't "change her stance because of more data" or whatever, she changes her stances based purely on political convenience. Much like Trump.

Edit: You got BTFO and then decided you didn't want to play ball. Go be a blind partisan somewhere else lol.

Lol it's a spac, it's unlikely to go lower than 22 cause you can redeem spac shares pre merger for its initial price (or something close to it).

Ie, if it goes below 22, it's free money cause you can redeem those shares for 22.so it is very unlikely to happen. Cheap options are cheap for a reason

Here's a logical thought:

A) If individual votes don't matter like you're saying

and

B) You like the third party candidate you are choosing

then

C) Vote for whoever the fuck you like because your vote doesn't matter (A).

Is that dumbed down enough for you? You apparently can't even understand your own logic.

My issue with what you're saying is it is not less deadly due to mutations. It is less deadly (as long as healthcare systems are not overwhelmed) due to improvements in treatment.

Use of dexamethasone, possibly remdesivir, avoiding of intubation, proning, etc.

Some of this is contingent on making sure healthcare isn't overwhelmed so restrictions are still necessary I'm afraid.

Look, I don't like this either, and researchers are working as rapidly as possible to get us through this. But, just wishing for it to be so or wishing for the virus to be becoming less deadly doesn't help us.
Google Allan Lichtman, money's on Biden.

Embarrassed to say, this was my strategy as a bear during April, just trying to time shit, not knowing that ain't how the market work.  I work in Medicine and everything is about patterns and trends, but in the short term, markets are just illogical, just do what everyone else is doing or sit out and wait for your move
your little echo chamber r/conservatives is that way
During the FED Meeting this week.
bigly isn‘t even a word
No matter what, if you have a position that is over 100% gains, sell enough contracts to get back what you put in. Let the rest ride until you think they are at their max potential, but if everything goes south you literally can't lose. The hard part is getting to 100%.

 if you buy enough contracts I'm sure you can do the same with 50%. Just sell 2/3 contracts at 50% gains or 1/2 contracts at 100% gains to recoup your initial investment.

So it isn’t as deadly now, right? It has mutated to be less deadly and is now being treated better than when it was a relatively unknown virus. More and more people suffer LITTLE TO NO SYMPTOMS! That’s what I thought... Less than ONE PERCENT are dying from COVID-19 now. You don’t destroy your economy and significantly increase unemployment for something that has that little affect. When 1,100 people die, in week, from COVID-19 and 26,000+ die from other causes, BAN OTHER CAUSES!!!

THIS NUMBER MATTERS
How hard is it to find American girls who are actually thin and have a good body?

Even your "sexy phat ass" grillz would be chubby to mildly obese in europoor land.
Do you cut both legs at the same time or try to time it?

Trying to time both legs is going to eventually screw you over. I honestly don't like straddles and strangles. I think its better to go heavy on the direction you favor and use the other direction as a hedge with less contracts.

Ex. SPY at $325, you believe its going to $330. Buy 3 $330 calls and 1 $320 put. Technically a strangle but that one put is just a hedge that likely expires worthless
Learned that two weeks ago or so. Very convenient.
thanks mayn, hero of 2020
You’re the idiot.
I went from 2k into 45k this week to lose everything other then 5k thinking it was going to dump EOD Friday. I was a greedy pig, futures are made to fuck you over that’s just plain and simple.

I mean, I have no clue if the sell off is over or not and I basically remind myself that every close.  I'm a wimp and I just don't hold overnight anymore.  Yes, I can possibly make a couple gains but I've gotten fucked a couple times recently.  Instead I just do a couple sparing intraday trades and that's it.  It works alright, but like everything else, it works til it doesn't.  Just hoping it works for a bit longer :D

You’re either manic or way too wealthy to be on WSB. I’m having a hard time deciding which but I think you’re underestimating the difficulty of medicine. It’s not as simple as plug symptoms and lab values into neural net. Even if it were successful you’d have to deal with the liability end of things. There are some applications for ML, like my field of radiology, but the current ML are limited to specific diagnoses and miss more complex presentations or findings. The best ML can hope for at this point in time is adjunctive measure which could be worth a lot but certainly won’t be replacing doctors anytime soon, especially not clinicians who have the added benefit of physically seeing and examining the patient. Not to mention the scenario you’re painting places all the liability on the insurance company because you can’t sue a computer. Never gonna happen in America.

That's a lot of Donnie Dollars if Trump wins.
Interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.
See how we are looking Monday. If we don’t see a big dip I’d think about holding them through the election. If we get a big dip tomorrow I might sell then

Once clarity settles in with this election we will find a clear direction, but I do think the selloff is over.

My theory is that bonds have been lower because QE is essentially a collateral loan. I don’t think the FED is incentivized to mark bonds at higher prices because it would push the dollar up. Friday’s QE bond purchases were actually bid up from 56 billion to 72 billion. While bonds dropped in value, they are doing something fougazi with the values. Remember they lost control of the Repo market rate in 2019. The more QE less bonds in the repo market pushing lending rates up and Bond rates down but values up. But idk if you haven’t seen the Steven Van Metre DD here’s his [video](https://youtu.be/beyCMiPvGTg) about Friday
Hold and sell them when they are too low, best strategy.

I got fucked with a PDT for trading more then 4 on Friday. I cleared it up but I usually sell option it settles instantly then I buy something else. I withdrew before close on etrade Friday and got slammed. Margin account btw. I do find TD to be a much better brokerage to be honest, in terms of keeping PDT in check reminding you and such. Etrade isn’t user friendly at all, but they fill orders super quick.

I mean the market has been overpriced for a long time.  PE is high in S&P but the S&P is no measure of the true economy anymore.  Mostly tech companies who are mostly insulated from this current pandemic.

So my feelings are you will see another drop but not anymore significant than the last.  S&P to maybe 2800 ish.  But all pandemic spike driven, which will happen.

During the March crash they didn't matter as much because volatility was crazy, but when volatility isn't that nuts it gives you a pretty solid indicator of the next day trend.

Uh... the majority of the moves happen during Globex...look at the daily chart since April.  Include the globex session when you do
Shouldn't this be a shitpost?
Just don’t see a run up going. It’s in a downtrend and RSI doesn’t indicate a reversal. That and the broader market selloff isn’t helping either.  I can see this low 40’s before earnings Thursday
I remember it used to rain Gold, actual Gold on day like this before market open. 😇😇😇😇😇

Idk where u took math in school but it is way off. The percent gain is the selling price of all the contracts- the initial investment of 3840. Then divide that by you initial. You then multiply by 100. In not one of these scenarios do you get the 108 or 346 percent gain off of $5 that you claim

Yeah, hindsight bias is a bitch; it's easy for me to look at a huge red or green day and think "fml, I should've just gone into calls/puts" but I gotta remind myself that I made the decision because I didn't know what would happen.  Case and point tomorrow, I expect a red day given the UK shutdown but with the huge pump EOD Friday, I didn't wanna risk it

If you have no consideration for such basic aspects of playing the markets, you’re almost certainly going to regret playing.

For liquidity to be an issue one leg of the straddle would have to be deep in the money. I always sell the straddle at market value. The deep in the money call/put will trade within 1 dollar of the ask price. The far out of the money is usually chump change and I never really care for it.

Also its why I only do it with spy or spx.

Futures are easy as fuck to arbitrage into 1:1 when the market's open, hence they're a good way to trade with more leverage/ easy shorting, hence they have volume, hence their price action definitely matters when the markets are closed.

Cool. Now the mms gotta buy more stock to fill the orders, then stock will go up. We will make money. More people will come in. Repeat. Then (whoever started this 100x before us) gets out 100% and it nosedives. Then all of us choose to get out or are bag hold - this choice would promote the stock price to fall potentially.

Maybe there really is a tipping point somewhere, where these mega corps can't be stopped, but historically the MSFTs and AMZNs of the world eventually prove unable to make the necessary adjustments or get too bogged down by other factors to always hold their advantage as newer tech and paradigm shifts emerge. Maybe FSLY and NET do get gobbled up, but odds are that nobody can stay on the throne forever.
Go Hawks!
Stonks sometimes go up before they go back down
Assets are also effected by interest rates more directly which means they are second order to macro economic conditions

think about it capital needs a return so it will seek it out either in bidding up stocks or real estate which we saw both of after Fed lowered rates worldwide

its not the economy and so it only might crash with it
Asides from one major dip on futures on election night, Market rallied the entire election week in 2016.
So are you implying a sell off through EOY in that scenario?

OP retarded for using white subtitles (wtf is that font even) on bright background
Where
My concern is that other people will believe you (if anyone reads this) so I'll give a very simple example:

If you have a 60% chance of flipping a coin and hitting heads what are the odds of you doing it twice in a row?

Very simple, 1-.6^2. But what is .6 to the second power? .36. 36%. Your odd go down to 64%.

So for the simplicity of understanding sequences and probability strings your odds of success even if you had the edge at the beginning worsen as you continue the string. 

If you have a 70% chance it becomes 51% so essentially you still lose edge.

You barely hold edge after three iterations at 80% with 49%. This is simplified but basically the reason why not everyone is rich is not because people can't make good plays or that good plays don't happen but that doing it multiple times in a row is extremely difficult.

Basically unless you make a Fastly type play by total accident going up literally tens or hundreds of thousands of percent at a time it's rare. Not the mention a bunch of other things that people typically fail to understand about probability such as skewness and drift.
Most fun owners...if I pull this out it’ll be enough to scare them and they will run away. 

Reality, if you pull out that hammer and don’t pull the trigger you’ll be the dead one.

I'm not talking about banks and institutions interacting with the repo market and that type of reserve collateral, I'm referring to managed funds literally long TLT itself having to possibly dump their shares in order to hold margin requirements. Separately from my angle, many this year are flipping from seeing QE as deflationary for bonds instead of inflationary because they suck availability and liquidity from the market. But that's an argument about as hot as politics right now and I'm not equipped to present it with hard facts and no bias. My bottom line is TLT will act like a lower volatility SPY in my view.

Yeah normally spacs have Units which are then split into Warrants and Common shares, but with PSTH ackman did something weird and also attached additional warrants to the pre-merger shares. 

The merger will detach them and the shares will turn into the new ticker of the merged company, and the 2/9th warrants will turn into warrants of the new company. Just buy in quantities of 9 shares so you don't have fractional warrants left over since those are just lost in the conversion.

It's a tricky way for him to inflate the value of the pre-merger shares to ensure that no one redeems them for nav at the merger.

There's a well documented correlation between US Equities and the Forex markets specifically, USD/x trade pairs - to save you some of your ever fleeting time some very nice people have created the DXY index

Watch it: 

Is DXY going up? 
Then SPY = DOWN (for now)


I left out some details (like dont try this with USD/CAD, go read about it yourself if you actually want to learn something)

60% Chance 🅱️ wins and we know by 3am on Wed, 30% 🅱️ wins and it takes a few days/weeks to find out, 10% chance 🥭 wins and it will prob take a few days/weeks to find out.


So basically 60% chance we moon 40% chance SPY goes on sale again lol. 100% chance we explode after stimulus/vaccine news, we just don’t know exactly when that will happen. Time to catch some knives

You being incorrect is clicking just fine.
When does futures show up?
Yah, I’m not betting on a Trump win. It’s not hard to assume that polls have adjusted since being wrong in 2016. And even to this day, I still believed the polls were correct. The only wildcard was that 2 days before the actual election the FBI/CIA announced a federal investigation into Hillary from a “source” and then quickly card it off 1 day after the election. Lmao. So obvious Russian meddling. 

Trump won by only 60,000 votes in the 3 battleground states. That was definitely the deciding factor.

Eat my vag
I'm with you mostly.  The problem I have is lack of patience and resolve among progressives.  This isn't something that's fixed in a few election cycles.  We need decades of pushing the party left and showing the fuck up in primary elections and during town halls.  

This means compromising even when we are forced to vote for a Clinton or Biden.  While I really don't like that Biden is not pushing for M4A, and an extensive GND proposal he's going to get us back on the right path if Dems can get the Senate.

Thanks Trump! He ruined my entire life
Powder or tablets?
So I know everyone is saying this is a double top. Its not... UNLESS volume shoots up on Monday. If stock price starts falling below $320 AND trading volume is high, then there is a strong possibility that SPY will tank to $281.

Keep an eye out boys. This has potential to be a tendie generator.
Spreads are big and this already played out if you look at the charts

You can't post confident opinions and be cash gang at the same time lmao wtf
I see your point but every time they do QE don’t  they sell bonds for more $ for collateral. If the dollar strengthens as it has been won’t yields be pushed down as they are pulling bonds out of the system strangling the rate. I don’t think they announce negative rates, I think it just happens and the market freaks.

Nah you're just bad at expressing yourself
U dumb? First energy its not ETF
They do but it’s annoying how it’s done. They grant you ~8 shares a year in RSU’s and then after a year from the grant they give you half. But to cover taxes they take a share or two. So if you get 4 shares at $90/share and taxes are $126 you only end up with two shares. Still “free stock” but less than advertised.
Saw this just as I saw...that
Yeah, as a non-American I'm betting that Trump will win.  The media has lost any credibility and I'm 90% sure the polls are lying as the media always does.  Only now they are reporting Trump has a chance chance because they realized they shot themselves in the foot.

I don’t think there will be a nationwide lockdown, but more likely some federal support for at-risk cities that decide to lock down.  I do believe those decisions will need to be made locally.  And leaders should feel less fear of retribution if they decide to do it.

I'll buy 100 in the morning
I feel like, without any bad news, we are as low as we will probably go, yeah I am kinda counting on a definitive win (for either party, i don't think it matters much) but if i get up 15% at any point ill probably just take the win instead of wait it out, and i think that is somewhat likely on a bounce.

i'll probably set up a sell order in the morning accordingly.

ATHX if you're into biotech with potentially explosive returns.

More indications constantly being discovered and set into clinical trials. Equivalent of investing in penicillin way back when if one company had the exclusive patent on it, they are going to address so many immunoregulatory ailments that we currently have no real treatments for.

I liked it because it was all business. Very little group work. No fluff bullshit  assignments. You either know your shit or you don't. 

Very humbling too, just when you start to think you're smart some Japanese kid who sits and the back and never talks shows an ingenious solution to a problem that you could never dream of

Tomorrow is more QE purchasing. Futures will be -2%, leading to down less than a percent. Tuesday same, up a little Wednesday (blue wave). Then its depression time.

Do you know how many times I’ve see this post back in 2018 September/October got charts are pretty smooth brain I mean look it could happen but anything could happen also ta is fucking wack yo
Holy shit. I had no idea

Edit: It doesnt work for me
Can someone tell me what "futures" mean??
You know you are talking bond yields right? I see what you see but it might take months to make that move, theta gonna poke your asshole wide open
idk post her nudie pics
They are already dead bro
Yep. The drop in March didn't happen all in a day. There were lots of green days on the way down. Many of the trades are automatically executed both ways based on percentage points down. If we hit SPY 310, there could be a ton of buy orders sitting there that spike a green day. The next day, we could be at 300.

The "Tuesday flat" might be the "sell off Monday and wait", then buy back on the low, if anything.
Do futures start trading at 8pm ET?
That's a fucking parlay if I've ever seen one. Someone has to sweep every battleground and give you a decision by Tuesday night. Miss even one, and your calls are fucked.

Good luck, dumbass.
Wouldn’t you have to pay a ton in taxes? It’s a lose lose situation. However if the market tanks, at least it’ll recover?
Yea I think it’s all about to take a massive shit
Where can I inverse
Unless, you know, the uncertainty doesn't go away.
Zoom out on the chart and try to imagine how profitable it would've been to buy puts on every rally over the past month. 

Then realize that I've actually been doing it.


This ain't pain. It's euphoria.

One of my besties stopped talking to me because I fucked his crush. I didn't even know she was his crush and I didn't even know she had a crush on me for years already.

She was his little sister 's friend. I can only imagine he would have murdered me for doing his sister.
Nah still would need to wait 20 minutes...

Do you see how TLT rose during the initial crash and then plummeted after the sustained selloff? And then this week it went down with the market? The countercyclicals have been moving with cyclicals now and will be sold to maintain collateral requirements if requirements increase due to extreme volatility. There's a similar argument for gold and utilities. TLT doesn't have much more of an upside until the proposal of negative rates begins to appear. People would be more likely to flee to IG corporate bonds in the event of a scare than to treasuries, though this time there wouldn't be a sustained liquidity crunch due to a better preparedness for such an event.

The early voting totals have already crossed 90% of the total votes cast in 2016 in the swing states. I think we are getting unnecessarily worried, without calling for whom, the votes will be overwhelmingly for one of the 2 candidates. A decisive result on Tuesday evening will crash the Vix on Wednesday. Keep your eyes on Dave Wasserman's Twitter and trade accordingly.

PWR or FSLR tomorrow? Quanta’s P/E only 23 but of course it’s kind of an old man play(energy infra). FSLR also an old man solar play (but 41 P/E). I remember when I started trading back in ‘06 it was a momo stock though and it went nuts (25 to 250 in a year). Would love to ride it back up to 250 again, maybe even tree fiddy.

--------
Let's keep it shorter and simpler then to see if we can fix this:

>You do not stumble across the company - but you def stumble across the lotto ticket- when you have no idea what you’re doing. 

That's like saying you don't stumble across the gas station but you stumble across the lotto tickets being sold rather than buying them yourself. You don't need a PhD in finance to get "Calls mean it's going up"; in fact losing money when it goes up is the confusing part but it's a directional bet. People get that. 

>You may have called zooms beat .. but the insane rally? No lol

It doesn't surprise me seeing as I specifically said "they are being used a lot more" so it's not even that insane. It's overvalued in my opinion but I am not the market.

>The meme stock phenom is new .. that’s why it has new name.

Dot com Bubble. Merger Mania in the 80s. Housing Bubble. All the same shit. 

Relevant Terms: "Bubble", "Pump & Dump", "Short & Distort" etc. The name here is nothing more than swapping out the word "rad" for "cool". Don't get twisted up in nomenclature for the same thing. It's not new at all. 

>Yes there have been bubbles before .. but this wave of retail cult following of stocks based company recognition and not based on fundamentals is new.

You were born after the Dot Com bust. You have no idea how much worse it was. Like, literally, some of those companies did *nothing* not just theoretically but actually. Basically imagine a market of hundreds of Nikolas. That was real. That happened.

>It’s easy to get the one that takes you to 10k .... hmmm millions of new retail investors would disagree lol.

Just look around here. You get it all the time. I mean the reason why it is the easiest number is because the amount of seed capital to do it is so low; a 5x on 2k will do it. You're ignoring that. A lot of people's charts here start at savings around 3~5 so it's a single trade that does it for them.

>I think our debate can be summed up by stating you believe their is no luck that it all predictable for the most part.

That's incredibly inaccurate. I think that instead the "luck" you're referring to *in the stocks beginners choose* being evident is incorrect based on the fact that people typically will bet on things they know or are aware of and beginners esp. are less likely to do sound market research. The irony comes from the fact that if you're from the general populace the odds are high you're going to go with something you use that *many people use* and that drives profitability etc. Basically you *naturally* use the winners. 

>I disagree .. strongly lol if it were we’d all be rich.

No. I get this because a lot of people struggle with this part of probability but the probability of doing something once is simple and the compounding probability of repetition is extremely complex. That's the key to understanding risk, risk management, etc. is that you're going to make outstanding plays that drive you up *n* but at the same time you're guaranteed that you will likely make plays that drive you down *m* as well which means that ultimately becoming rich is a matter of making the same trade profit over and over again and this is simply nearly impossible to do at random. I mean if you have strong strings sure, so if you went from 1,000 on ZM Calls to APPL Puts to SNAP Calls in three moves you probably are a millionaire but that's incredibly difficult to do if you have no skill.

So skill kicks in after so many iterations. Your first ones are free because you have a natural bias towards popular and profitable companies just by your ignorance of the entire market but as you go further on your natural bias fades and you have to actually do research.
Don't wait another year to propose,  she might get tired and find someone serious.

> Unless the Democrats get both houses of congress and the presidency, making it irrelevant what the Republicans want.

Pretty unlikely to take the exec, both houses _and_ carve out the Senate super majority, which is what really matters if you want to get shit done in Congress.

But even if they pull off a miracle, there is that pesky 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court to contend with.

What's Remy the frenchie's presidential prediction?
What I mean is whenever they are out of power the R's scream bloody murder about the deficit. And then when they're in the majority they forget all about it and increase the debt to the largest it's ever been. Happened under Reagan, happened again under Bush 43, happened a third time under Trump.
Naw. Biden wins the stock market will plummet for three reasons: taxes are lower right now, end of year cash outs always happen, and illicit investors will be spooked by the potential of oversight. Expect negative interest rates

My spidey sense says you bought calls. It also says that the market is going to tank when the Euros start dumping out.

Totally different scenario. But IF it plays out anything like 2016 then Friday was the bottom .... reaching here but need some sort of hope
Prepare yourself for 4 years of McConnell undermining sleepys agenda. No massive capital gains tax increase, no stock transaction tax, no green new deal. Joe will try nationwide lockdown but Supreme Court will shut it down. The airlines will be bailed out, small stimmy will be passed, and the bull market will return

Yeah, so pretty neutral. 

GEX is the bigger indicator lately.  Super low.
You could take a shit load more and be fine even with no tolerance. Night just be uncomfortable at higher doses. Insufflation is nearly instantaneous so you can take half and if that does the trick save the other half, if not then snort the other half.

Personally I recommend just swallowing it though, longer lasting and more bang for your buck.
Barely...between 40 and 45 is still neutral.
Because the market also did great when the rates were at 35% and Biden wouldn't raise it even close to that much.

You sound unemployable, so here's another pro tip. 

Do not auto withdraw taxes from your weekly unemployment.  Use theoney to yolo on your ticker of choice.  If you lose, elect mark to market on your taxes and you can deduct the full amount of the loss in that tax year instead of getting cucked at 3k.  If you win, roll it forward until you hit milli or bust.  Gl hf

Vix calls is a thing I never thought. The shits Wallstreet creates.

You're betting in the volatility of the volatility.
Correct, capital requirements to exercise the warrants.

Warrants are higher risk but higher reward.  Using a normal SPAC as an example:

You have 100 commons and 100 warrants. The commons are $10, warrants are likely $1. A target is announced and people like it, and commons go up to $15. Your commons went up 50%. Warrants likely go up to around $5, and you just went up 500%

If it's a bad target. Commons will likely stay at around $10 because of the redemption value, but warrants  could likely sell off and approach zero. 

In warrants, your gain and loss percentage are substantially higher than commons.
What's your dividend payout?
If you're going to buy PSTH, buy shares. Options are almost always a bad idea on spacs, you have no idea when action will happen and they're usually overpriced. 

And in this case the warrants are super overpriced, so buy the shares with partial warrants attached - they're approximately at a fair value when you figure in the fractional warrant value.
All some politicians care about is optics. The past few years have not been a both sides issue. The democrats in the house passed a bill that would have put literally trillions into the hands of Americans 5 months before the election. McConnell and Trump were fools not to take it.
That it doesn't stay there for long. Extremely volatile year though.

Interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.

Who wants fun Sunday afternoon data analysis?

Compared:

* Lowest GEX percentile, SPX High-Low Spread percentile, SPX Volume percentile, and VIX percentile for every day since 5/2/2011 (the day SqueezeMetrics started DIX/GEX).

**Friday - 10/30/2020:**

* **GEX:**
   * \-78,315,991 (93rd % lowest daily GEX)
* **SPX Volume:**
   * 4,840,450,000 (91st % of all daily SPX volume)
* **SPX High-Low Spread:**

Of all **2,393 trading days** since 5/2/2011, **only 44 (1.84%)** have had all 4 of those metrics be greater than 90%

What does it all mean?  No idea.

Because of the same stuff basically. Once a lot of it is passed in a week or so, it is no longer an uncertainty. The uncertainty is what pulled us down. IV crush post election is probably going to get a lot of people.

Idk I’m asking myself the same question
Well prediction time: futures will melt up to about 1 or 1.5% until Europe opens, at which point we'll gradually sell off until we're at about .5% entering pre market.  Open will be absolutely bullish with QQQ up like 2% before we slide back down to around 1% before power hour at which point I have no fucking clue but if I had to bet my life I'd say we finish about .5% up tmr.  

Not what the bulls will be looking for after last week and last month but perhaps good enough to get out from some of your tech calls before the election on Tuesday where anything other than a biden landslide will have us in free fall.

Be careful playing the volatility plays.  It's already elevated AF and a Biden landslide will take it back down 30-40%.  If you're betting on a contested election good luck.  Not a play I'm going to make, seems too obvious and something that MM have already priced in given market wide volatility end of last week.

You are way overthinking this. Biden has "talked about" raising capital gains tax. What is Biden? A fucking politican. If you are still naive enough to think the kind of shit they say during an election year that they follow through after, you are way too innocent for the market. And let's say he does raise the capital gains tax. You think that shit's overnight? It will take at least 2 years before he's able to do that. We are in a goddamn pandemic, taxes are the last thing on democrat's agenda. First is stimulus, deal with pandemic and THEN raise taxes. Even then I doubt he can pass whatever they think they can. 

Yes if Trump loses he won't even pass $1 no more he would rather burn this bitch to the ground out of spite. BUT markets are forward looking and it dont matter as long as we get a massive stimulus confirmed for January.

Someone posted that earlier on here so I was asking.
Well, they’re probably waiting to see who gets elected. If Biden wins, it benefits their platform to have his presidency start with a huge deficiency/debt increase cause by the stimulus package, because then they’ll be yelling “loohk DeMoCrraTs BhaD hUrR duRr”. They don’t want to have to pass another stimulus under a Republican presidency because it’s bad optics. All politicians care about— optics.

They’re all disgusting.

And don’t misconstrue me pointing out TB12 had every advantage a QB could ask for as me saying he sucks. I point them out as proof that he had advantages no other QB in history has ever had. Did he make the most of them? Absolutely. Is he the greatest? Nope.
Because he's old af. My old af grandma bruises if you look at her too hard. 🐢 probably squeezed his dick too hard. I'd hate to see what it looks like.

Not much worse news can come out. Second wave was priced in at sept. Election was priced in last week. Now we are flat, regardless who wins. Plus IV will make options not even worth it.
stimulus is guaranteed under Trump too.

Biden will raise capital gains tax, this mean people will want to get out before taxes are raised, they will take profit. 

massive selloff happens. 

Trump will throw temper tantrums until January refusing to cooperate in lame duck means no stimulus at least until

I dont think the virus dissapears in 6 months and ppl start going back to gyms. home fitness is here for at least 18 months at this level assuming there is a vaccine. now if there is NO vaccine then NLS and PTON are going to be huge. WFH is great but people are getting fat from the lack of gyms.

prob a bearish indicator tbh

I've been hearing about this. When do they announce the results of prop 22?
DIX is at 43.6%

We had a solid red week

VIX is already high

DXY is already pumped

There is a possibility of Senate flipping to blue

U need to find a more cool vet think of it like doctors most of them won’t sell u pills but some would 😂
Could be true but we might also have to consider lockdowns in the US and whether there is a blue/red wave or not, bc if we have senate and president w diff parties chances of stimulus might still be low.
Kangaroo Monday, Quintriple circuit breaker Tuesday, Triple circuit breaker Wednesday, Thursday and Friday Morning Bull Trap, Friday afternoon bad sell off.

Can't afford unless you crash nasdaq for me
Tomorrow will probably be a lot of buying while Tuesday/Wednesday might see a slight sell off
Oh shit
Which is which?
You buying calls or shares? Thinking of doing the latter and setting up a trailing stop loss so I don't get IV crushed if I miss out on a big swing.
NO. This is the last place for right wingers and you WILL NOT take it away.

Thanks to whoever posted the brazzers link this morning
They said they fixed it in February but the same shit happened last year too so it’ll probably be down
Can you talk a bit more about different risk/reward ratios if one contemplates going into shares (obvious), warrants, or options in this one. Particularly want to understand economics of warrants given possible scenario outcomes.

Thanks for the DD.

Edit: Also do you still get 1/9 warrants in case of shares? I thought that applied to units alone, before common units started to trade. 

Also my understanding is that if stock price is >$20 for 20/30 trading days, Mgmt can redeem these at 10 cents on the dollar (or you just redeem based on the stock price). Given the exercise price is $23 and warrants trade around $7,  not sure if I see the economics here unless I am interpreting something incorrectly.
I’m not sure what your comment has to do with mine.
Wake me up when NOVEMBEAR ends
the market crash happened due to the fact that trading became automated and therefore banks were short selling at the same time which caused a huge sell off.

Sure we might see a drop but most people will just hold and buy since they saw what happened after the covid drop it got right back up for new ATHs
Let’s not jump to conclusions that this subreddit uses logic.
what the flying fuck?
I think that means something is so basic it can’t get more so. The kids are saying it I believe.
Get long as fuck on the index, everyone is bearish
And you’re eating chicken tendies or pizza no?
Should I buy COD Cold War or Watch Dogs Legion?

Watch Dogs looks like a really good game, but I could probably get it for cheaper later since it’s a single player game... COD is usually best to buy at launch
NIO 31c (at 30.74)

VXX 27c (at 26.5)

SPY 325p (at 327.3)

How fuk am I
Lol the real market crash will come when everything is back to normal to fucking rail all the liquidity that retail has pumped into the markets. Ain’t no way MMs going to let the common man make a buck on the markets.
I'm kinda afraid that the 2nd stimulus is just a vehicle used to get votes and after election we won't get shit. Maybe something very very tiny.
since it's a virus mutations are usually detrimental to the virus as it doesn't have the same checks and balances on it's dna/rna whatever the fuck

Selling puts on my life. Super cheap.
The ultimate goal is to convince people to either believe in a note/bill with a dead green president or a queen which is still alive on it, doesn't matter what, but as long as people believe in that special note/bill - everything will be fine

How about we go to dinner instead
Yuppp, winter is already a slow time for most businesses after the holiday season. If we go into lockdown I doubt any amount of stimulus will pull us through.
You're insane

Lol u said whats the inverse play??? Everyone is saying calls. So do weekly puts???
Sell off before a bigger crash and buy back later
6%+ of it goes down. 3%+ if up. My guess is down 6-10%. Also remember that we can all be completely wrong.
I think I am going to hold FB, AMD, NVDA, TSLA, IRM, NET long term

DKNG and PTON are probably going to get cut tomorrow at market open.

I really have no fucking idea what to do...
Look at the volume, taller bars = more volume

Bojack? I thought we were talking about the ending for horsin around. You know, where the horse dies of a broken heart

But have 1-10mill net worth places you in 95% percentile and they are ones who pay most taxes. Billionaire use llc can avoid paying any taxes (see Trump, Bezos).
Also they are going to buy Costco

Ah yeah that’ll do it.
Wait, TSLA has been meme status for 2 years?
Jeez the only scenario worse than Donald Trump winning would be Biden winning. I'm still pulling for Jo Jorgenson!
If it’s not NIO, I send it back
Who else is anticipating a massive end of week rally regardless of who wins?

End of election = End of uncertainty = Decreased Volatility = Stimulus and Vaccine Talk back on the menu = Stonks go up
Damn! Appreciate you pointing out how past performance is an indicator of future outcomes!
i think the avg. household networth at 65 is like 1-2 million in USA

it always cracks me up seeing these boomers thinking they're rich for having a couple of million, and crying about the 'rich people like me having to pay taxes' when in reality they're still miles away from anyone truly rich

smh fucking delusional people
nobody on WSB is shorting NIO.
It’ll be contested either way. Market won’t react at all.
Ima need an Undertaker like revival from them cuz my Leaps of 22c 1/15/21 are down 70% lol
Back in Spring when we were having 70 cases per day in Oregon, everything was shutdown including hotels, restaurants, beaches and parks. Now we are having 500 cases a day and everything is wide open.
Looks like you could use the living space.

So here’s the thing. I don’t want to sell because market may explode this week. I don’t want to buy because it might tank. Guessing futures are flat through Tuesday.

The funny thing about this is that people who have done very well for themselves and have $1-10m in the bank at 45-65 (my parents for example) are still 1000x away from the big boy level. I tell them all the time I want way more people to be able to be as successful as them, but Jeff Bezos and co are hogging that shit
Retarded trick💀
You make some good points.  A big problem with what you said is that the payout all depends on keeping it until expiration.  If it goes your way, that's great, but it has to stay there.  In order to exit early, you have sold an option that has increased in value and you need to buy it back.  It will usually be at a much higher intrinsic value than before.  The long side has increased as well so you will still make money, but not much.

The risk, however, is still there that the underlying moves against you and your position is toast.  The risk stays the same but the reward has been taken out.  I get if someone doesn't have the money and can only afford spreads.  Also super high IV situations can work but overall, they seem high risk, low reward trades.

For me, all that matters is the underlying and so if someone is good at picking the right stocks, they would make significantly more in just buying the call or put options than spreads.  Also, they have the flexibility to exit positions early with large profits where spread profits wouldn't make nearly as much profit even if the underlying moves in their direction.
Sure

Yeah but mostly unrealized at this point from shares. My options trading p/l took a huge shit after these last 2 weeks - almost to the point to where I just want to quit completely. But like the walking meme I’ve become, I’m sure it’ll go like fuck you WSB, see you Monday.

He's about to get a house with crazy interest and zero money down just because they approve anyone.


I laughed, but turns out he wasn't joking. They really need to start teaching finances in high school. These retards aren't going to ever use a unit circle and they're fucking their lives up.
That's what cracks me up when people are worried about more taxes even though it doesn't affect them, because they think they will become millionaire and may have to pay more when they do.

You do not stumble across the company - but you def stumble across the lotto ticket- when you have no idea what you’re doing. What about those that had snap options but they didn’t print nearly as much as others due the greeks. 

You may have called zooms beat .. but the insane rally? No lol 

The meme stock phenom is new .. that’s why it has new name. Yes there have been bubbles before .. but this wave of retail cult following of stocks based company recognition and not based on fundamentals is new. 

It’s easy to get the one that takes you to 10k .... hmmm millions of new retail investors would disagree lol. 

I think our debate can be summed up by stating you believe their is no luck that it all predictable for the most part. So predictable and so frequent that every idiot is on the verge of being an idiot savant

Will not dump right away it will probably go up until the big boys start setting up for the bull traps leading in to more volatility and then a direction will be determined. Weather the bulls take it or the bears take it  there’s no saying your guess is as good as mine. But I don’t think the market will immediately come down if Biden gets into office and the opposite if trump is re-elected I think there will be a little down side but I would probably by the the dip assuming that the market will continue up.

It's very confusing that "patriotic" people support someone that is literally tearing apart and trying to destroy what they supposedly love, and the rest of the world looks up to this shitshow for guidance and direction, like America has any of the answers. The whole situation is bonkers. I'm with Elon on this one: let's get to Mars so we can leave the madness behind. In the meanwhile im just YOLOing it on China stocks. They have a nice stable dictator ship and have the virus under control and I've got no worries about crazy trump tantrums/problems.

Obviously you’re very smart but your mistake is thinking that means you understand all the intricacies that make up market valuations. I have an engineering background but am in medicine that’s heavily involved with machine learning. I’m just saying that there’s a lot of potential with AMD to make large leaps from where they have been in the chip market. Their valuation is based on potential not current market status. The market is future oriented.

We have a problem here in PA. Most have known that it potentially decides the election for a while now. In PA we haven't had widespread mail-in or early voting and are quite unprepared for it. Battles have already been ongoing in state government and courts regarding the process and it's practically been assumed that we won't be able to get a count by Weds. Tbh, I usually don't buy into these disaster narratives, but I think we are gonna fuck things up here and have a chance to end up like FL in 2000 if the race isn't a blowout one way or another.

Because it would be too late? The election results come out at night unless democrats dont show up to vote, which seems unlikely given the current early voting. Only futures are open at night and by the time market opens, if what I imagine happens we will open 3-4% higher possibly more. There’s only a certain scenarios in which this doesn’t work. 1) contested election (I had been on the sidelines because of this for at least a month but looking at the data I just don’t see how Biden doesnt sweep senate as well. 2) Trump refuses to leave. That is a real concern and I have hedged with far OTM puts that expire end of Nov. these are potential 100 baggers and would offset any losses on the call side. 3) Trump wins but loses senate or vice versa. This is a scenario that loses me money apart from that I am good.
VIX made a higher high on this two-week dump.

VXX... not even close.

why is that?
Futures make more sense than the market though.

I mean, they're always red on bad news. Unlike the market.

Let me guess:

1. Don't FOMO

2. Gamblers fallacy 

3. Time in Market not Timing the Market 

4. Only use 1-2% if your portfolio on anything riskier than an index fund 

5. Enjoy being poor your whole life and stacking your tendies up so you can enjoy them when you're 65-70 because life should be planning your retirement. 

6. If you do a risky trade, paper hand ASAP 

These videos have safe advice. Which is fine for 90% of investors, especially those with good jobs and a 401k. But I work at Wendy's and I'd much rather yolo my extra money for a chance of actually having a decent life or paying off the community college classes I'm in right now and being able to quit wendys to focus on school or start a small hustle that would be better than food service. 

It's not that these videos are wrong, they are just bland as fuck and 40+ minutes is way too long for me to watch it when I've seen 40 others with the same title and same boring advice that means nothing for a sub $20k account.

I'm kind of bullish and kind of bearish. Regardless, I have my lube ready for all my holes.
How do we get options that travel through time
Every time I go home my folks give me a few things I did as a kid. Crappy drawings, medals/trophies, etc. I’ll go through it before I leave and keep one or two things to show my kid then when I stop for gas on the way out of town the rest goes in a trash can.
They amount of people bullish in here is retarded.  How are you going to be this optimistic for Monday.   Europe shutting down and Rona is set to get parabolic.  Not to mention the election Monday.  I can almost guarantee circuit breakers are coming

I don't buy it for a minute. The National Guard will kill everyone that will try to do anything funny. 

Actually trained soldiers are so ridiculously more powerful than a random redneck, it's not even funny.

The Proud Boys (if that's what you are talking about) looked like a bunch of gay idiots. Most of Trump's supporters are again... old people with canes.

Nobody is going to start a civil war, because nobody has the infrastructure to sustain one. The military is a literal superpower if any conflict were to arise. The soldiers are too stupid to pick a side, so they will just take everyone that tries to shoot them. 

Nothing will happen.
The low volume/flat would definitely indicate a likely heavy selling move downward esp with the heavy volume on Friday showing there is still lots of traffic so I would likely switch to puts as well

I think you misread your own instructions. You can't discharge student loans which means you can't scam your way into paying them off via credit cards you can't back. Do you not think someone has not tried this before?

Basically they are government backed so ... no. The CCs will just report that you didn't pay them, the govt will pay the CCs and it's back on you.

Then I got $5 for watching something (I think Borat 2) and I think will get another $5 when Kindle ships (first purchase deal). So overall a nice discount. But the second day delivery is a total myth. Forget about waiting for a month for Kindle, every single product I ordered since then took a few days up to a week, lol. Even when it was scheduled to arrive sooner, I would get an "oops, we're running late" email. A joke.
In retrospect, yeah. But I was beating their returns for a little while. Btw, /r/investing is thatdaway

I was just having this conversation. The reason you get "lucky" your first time is because you actually tend to invest in things you know and understand to some degree. You are significantly less cautious your first time and basically you have a much deeper knowledge of the things that you know in your narrow universe before you open Pandora's box.

Seems like they dont want to compete with Intuit as they have some relationship (prev owned by them). Intuit has bought Mint and now Credit Karma ( which RKT should have bought IMO).
Is this the first time you are trading or first time trading options?  Trading options before you really understand the markets is like jumping into a pool when you dont know how to swim... Most likely you are going to drown.  

Some advice: 
1.) Dont trade weekly options even if they seem like a good deal as theta will likely crush you.  
2.) If you are in profit take some profit.  It is insane the amount of people who are up 50%+ and try to go for 100%, but end up with 0.
  3.) The vix closed the week at 38, volatility will be insanely high this week and it will probably be best to watch from the side lines until things calm down. 

I am sorry for giving real advice here, but this is not the time to jump into options.  If you have any specific questions, let me know.

Anyone have a concussion before? I was surfing yesterday and board smacked me straight in the nose. ER doc said I had an "open fracture" cause I had two big lacerations, one of them like an inch deep. Pretty sure it penetrated into my nasal cavity. Plastic surgeon stitched me up. 

I never lost consciousness or felt dizzy or lost balance or anything like that. I remember everything. 

Just worried if I did have one, it will make me more retarded than I already was.

Depression is a viscous reinforcing set of behaviors that cause you to spiral in further. A therapist is a great help but if it’s not an option you can start by making small incremental positive steps that will make it easier to sustain long term. I stayed by decided no matter how shitty everything is, that I will take a walk to the park everyday. Then I started trying to eat better and then eventually quit smoking weed. I’m now running 20 min a day and doing a quick workout for the last 4 weeks. It’s a constant battle but making the small changes and sticking to them makes it easier to continue improving yourself.   Also, I found that some days it’s ok to be depressed. Just embrace the darkness and try to manage it with sarcasm or listen to a favorite downer mood album. A lifestyle of , eating well, exercise should be your working goal, beating depression is just the byproduct.

>Interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.

[That](https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/1322971872003301379?s=21) was a close one. My puts might be fucked tho
Ya...I literally bought calls on Friday.
>When something like snap or zoom happens and you happen to be on the winning side of that ... it’s luck.

I've been doing this for a little longer than this year and nothing I've said doesn't apply to other years. M&A plays and such are all the same every year with the same results and rewards and sometimes even greater ones.

I called Zoom 3 months before it happened based entirely on the Corona Virus Pandemic and it's use in my workplace going up ridiculous amounts. It wasn't luck. In fact that's the problem here; Zoom was not luck. The uncertainty didn't lie in whether it was being used but instead by how much it would profit from it's use during the pandemic. Apparently everyone was blown away with massive increase in value because in this environment it really is just that useful. 

The part I am trying to get across is that it isn't luck at all. At least not in this case. If something has a strong correlation with the SP500 for instance and that is tanking it is very unlikely that any news is going to outrun the beta on the stock so it isn't really as shocking as it might seem that earnings in the past week, even on things we already knew would go up from a comparative view, were still not producing strong calls or positive prices. They simply fell with the market as a whole at the time. The same had to be true of the things that fell with their earnings in Feb / Mar into April. 

>It is a relatively new phenom with know real rhyme or reason behind it.

This is not new. You can go back to any bubble, any bust and any memetic behavior and see the same thing over and over. This is incredibly profitable hence all the sentiment concepts and scraping of forums and such; the data is profitable for certain. If it were new and no one knew what was happening there'd be no money in it.

>You could argue that currently,the possibility of newbie traders stumbling upon massive gains from meme stock culture is elevated .. Id argue that the probability is still low.

You don't "stumble" across companies you know. That's my point. No one "stumbles across" Snapchat. We all know what Snapchat is. You "stumble across" Regeneron. You "stumble across" Xilinx. You don't stumble across AMD.

>Is it possible to hit a 5k lotto ticket .. sure But in all probability it will be a while before you have a trade that successful.

Again this strongly depends on what your cost basis is. To get a trade that hits 5k from 2.5k is ... actually really common. Very. It was before this. It will be after. It even happens on just the stocks and not even the derivatives; a lot of people think that these market moves are rare but they aren't, and instead, they are heavily spaced out and complex to track so making 100% across 9 months in a year isn't what anyone is looking for but that is exactly how it tends to work out.

I personally think that your first 20k is the hardest because it's easy to get the 1 that takes you to even 10k buy 20+ in one go is very rare so you do have to actually string together trades and that lowers the probability of success substantially. This is especially true because capital sensitivity worsens as you get wealthier; the same amount of money you need to achieve a return is not the absolute value of a cashflow anymore so when you worked at Wendy's (whose earnings are this week ;) ) your making 30k was huge but if you work at your own firm or a bank or something like that your making 30k is sometimes a pittance.

>I think it’s dangerous to spread a narrative that suggests Snap like plays happen so consistently that all you have to do is be familiar with these types of cult companies to secure large profits.

I cannot stress enough that this stuff happens all the time. It is so common in fact that there is no one talking about it. I mean the Fastly puts thing with a 392x value? *That* is rare. From 2 ~ 18 based on the contract within a year is not astronomically rare because remember it's all leverage so the bet itself doesn't move linearly like the base might presuming the basis isn't an option itself. Heh. Options on options are freaking crazy.

Too many people betting on election uncertainty despite the fact that biden is dominating and even the polls being off as much as 2016 means (currently) that he'll still win.

I think everyone who loaded VXX calls late gets fucked. Very crowded trade.

I have no idea but it just happens. Looking back, I hate my first big "win" back in March and I hate my couple of bigger "wins" early October because they led to some bad decisions and the realization that I suck at trading. If you win big your first time or find yourself on a perculilar winning streak, cash out like you would as if you're at a casino the first day of your Vegas vacation.

Not saying you are wrong, but I wouldn’t be surprised if a majority of trump supporters go in person to vote on Tuesday. The people who advocate for keeping businesses and bars open probably wouldn’t have a problem voting in person. Might be pretty close.... and you know trump will contest Mail in ballots and mail in ballots can be accepted days after Tuesday. I don’t really see Biden winning clearly and trump not fighting back at all.

Going along with this scenario, can Biden win if MI, PA, and WI are not yet included? None of these 3 will have their absentee ballots counted by Thursday evening. Trump and Republican strategists will pursue legal battles if any of the three put Biden over 270.

Also, the swing states are the only ones that matter, and Trump is significantly closer in them than in national popular vote polls.

Republicans don't want anyone except them having money at all. That means no stimulus unless it's of the Reagan variety. Inflation and estate tax are their worst enemies, and they have a hard time beating it given their education is perpetually below their level of entitlement.

The nomination is more understandable. More like how Pelosi would not bring a reasonable stimulus bill to the table that could get passed.  The dems want a lot of the same thing the republicans want in the simulus bill if she really cared about the wellbeing of people she would have passed on all those things they agree on ASAP and then they can try to hash out the additional completely unrelated to Covid things the Dems wanted to earmark onto the Covid relief stimulus.

Talking about the VIX Calls
Polls predicted Clinton would win the popular vote by 3% she only won it by 2.1%.

Biden us a bigger lead, so for Trump to win, the polls would have to be more wrong than in 2016, and pollsters would have to know less about identifying Trump voters this time around.

Don’t let your politics get in the way of making money. Get calls ready for a Biden landslide. Puts expecting a close/contested election will not print.

Jesus christ the polls in 2016 showed hillary having a 70% chance of victory. Biden sits at 90% which means he's twice as likely as Hillary was to win. Does that mean he can't win? No. Is it likely? No. It's more likely that Biden wins in a 10 point national landslide than Trump wins.

Nah, I bought it on a whim because I got fucked by AMD. I spread out my money across a bunch of safe bets and long shots and it hasn't panned out well so far.

On 11/06, I have AMD and KO. KO53c also went tits up.

Down the line on 11/20, I have VBI spreads: one iron condor and one covered call credit spread. That stock hasn't moved much at all throughout the entirety of everything that's gone down. The call credit is just insurance as it's pretty much a given that it won't move up past $3.

12/16 I have MU60c, but looks like I'm completely retarded. I also went back into KO knowing that Thanksgiving and Christmas should drive Coca Cola sales.

RemindMe! 3 days
I don’t think it’s beginners luck .... It is luck in general. As I said everybody has a better chance of getting lucky right now... because the market is crazy. When something like snap or zoom happens and you happen to be on the winning side of that ... it’s luck. 

Of course we only see what people show us .. but many people do show and discuss their losing trades (in this forum and elsewhere). Imo trying to base an argument on meme stock culture is insane. It is a relatively new phenom with know real rhyme or reason behind it. 

You could argue that currently,the possibility of newbie traders stumbling upon massive gains from meme stock culture is elevated .. Id argue that the probability is still low. 

Is it possible to hit a 5k lotto ticket .. sure 
But in all probability it will be a while before you have a trade that successful. 

I think it’s dangerous to spread a narrative that suggests Snap like plays happen so consistently that all you have to do is be familiar with these types of cult companies to secure large profits.

Within a very short time frame, it's very unlikely for you to actually lose money. You'll have to be at the table basically all night for the house edge to kick in fully. 

With options, the memory component just takes away the random chance component, so I have better control of betting. It's like a roulette wheel with a bias. Not a guarantee, but better than a perfectly fair roulette wheel, although the compensation is just as unstable.
Ah yes, the S C R A P S strategy.

I wonder who buys my overly safe credit spreads, thanks bro
what’s that, a kangaroo wearing a clown mask?
How long until QQQM takes off? Slightly lower expense ratio and a cheaper entry point. Only missing volume.
Everyone thinks the markets are going to tank from here. Markets usually do the opposite of what everyone thinks. We rocket up when this election is over. Maybe a slight pullback a few days this week

I know you buckaroos don’t want to hear this but...

The election is not going to be very close. One candidate is polling way ahead of the other. And by way ahead I mean WAY ahead. 

“But the polls were wrong in 2016!”

Yes. They would have to be almost twice as wrong to be “wrong” this time around. The polling numbers are up there with Clinton and Reagan numbers before they won their respective landslide elections.

Market tomorrow will be moderately down and then close about par, then melt up with a decisive victory on Wednesday. All this pecker whacking is for naught.

Your body is probably well preserved now
An important point IMO:

Should there be a win for Biden BUT senate/congress is split, you can wave bye-bye to any stimulus bill, ever..

If republicans lose but somehow can control either, they will forever block any democratic stimulus attempt.

Same for the opposite case. Democrats will dig their heels in if they lose.

Overall, its going to be a shit show unless you get a landslide across-the-Isle dem or gop victory.

This week is going to be messy.

Edit: whatever you do, use stop losses - don't just hold, if it triggers a stop, take the loss and get back in when things change.. Don't hold a bag and get run over by a train this week.

It was just a joke mate, sorry
Speak to me daddy Pow
Not CRSR which has been the rock for me lately.
This is difficult to address because it is both "true" and "false" at the exact same time. 

To illustrate the "true" first let's take 11 0DTE (expires that day) options; the odds that news or impactful information will come out that shifts these options is low so the sentiment is the only driver and that may or may not work out for you but odds are that this is real gambling.

To illustrate the "false": buying options that are 3 months out or 6 months out however have real information contained in them. Now it is complex so let's avoid it but basically when you buy an option you're essentially buying the information known at time *t* versus the expectations regarding that information at time *t* so when something shifts violently in price due to new information or a new environment. You are not buying a lotto ticket; you are buying something that contains an actual memory (lotteries and all games of pure chance have no memories) and oddly enough that memory can even be expressed through complex formulations and ideas such as "sentiment" and "value". 

The danger in equating the two situations is that you will lose money if you mistake one for the other every time; there is no point in which games of chance with no memory align with games of chance that have a memory so a 0dte Strangle is indeed just betting on red and black at the same time while a 90dte option set of any type is making a decision based off of the best information you have today.

TL;DR: Never flip a coin 6 months in advance.
Waaaa so salty 😂😎

I think it’s a reprice of tech because tech/stay at home was so overbought and being used as a store of value. I think the whole market may bounce, and tech may outperform in that bounce, but I don’t think, for example, Zoom or Fastly or Netflix are gonna beat ATH anytime this year.

Oh, it’s priced in to some degree. But even though the potential potential issue has been obvious for months, it’s not the same as it becoming reality. It’s like unrealized losses vs realized losses on options. Sure, you see that you’re potentially down on your option for days ahead of time. You average it down, and you prepare mentally for some losses. But that doesn’t mean shit, once you realize it’s expiration day and you’re option is going to slip OTM, and you’re totally fucked because you bet your livelihood on AAPL.

ARKK is the perfect storm waiting to happen. Too many autist are putting this in their retirement accounts. The holdings are absolute shit outside of Tesla.

QQQM can now appeal to retail with a slightly lower expense ratio and within its price range all while following QQQ. If Cathy decided to step off, who’s going to replace her? A bunch nobodies is on her team. I’m all for yolo’ing but not on your fucking retirement.

There are several ways they can rig it, and it’s the main reason they rushed to get ACB in the SC. I can’t remember the specifics (there was a comment on Reddit linking to an FBI research that outlined the ways they can rig it) but there’s some loophole where Pence, as leader of the senate, can essentially push the EC to dismiss democratic votes and only count republican votes.

I’m thinking they’re not going to accept defeat in any case, and steal the election, in which case the shit will really hit the fan.

It's actually the least profitable part of casinos and sometimes isn't even profitable some weeks. They shift the lines to bring it as close to 50/50 bets as possible so they always profit on the baseline -110 odds, but there is absolutely money to be made if you bet ahead of the crowd and manage your bet sizes according to odds.

Sunday night future algos are about to have a field day with bull asses
Another interesting thing I read in a book about how we use and came up with time: when we spring ahead an hour, that day is the day with the most hospitalizations due to heart issues in the whole year. Not a coincidence. So many good arguments for ending the daylight savings BS.
Isn't there more volume in SPY puts?

There isn’t. The house doesn’t lose money on sports betting.
Exit all positions. Take 25% of your cash and dump it in puts. If you lose no big deal, only 25%
She live in a different state lol that’s not happening but I’m telling her to stop being so sorry for yourself everything you say you’re sorry for something. We have a trip to NY in December tho. I keep it cool most of the time

[deleted]
What did the SPY do in the days leading up to the last election?
«Suffer» implies pain, but i see nothing but gain 😎
So say hypothetically this election goes contested until January 21st, does Pelosi or Chuck Grassley then become the president?
That’s not what I said - the women willingly choose to have a child once they get a dude to erupt in them during a one night stand. They aren’t good enough for a relationship with the guy so keeping the kid is their consolation prize to lock in
Congratulations. May the recovery be fantastic, painless, and for no more tumors!
Wait, people on here read tree rings!?!? I thought it was all retards
 thats bad move

Autism at its finest. Well done bro. You def fit in here.

Spy is only in it to eat tendies.
Clear winner remember is by electoral votes, not by majority of inidividual votes. Depends who votes where. I am startign to get worried if Trump clearly wins just like last time which would be probably the most likely way for a win from him to occur, that everyone on left is just gonna ignore it and act like its a popular vote election and he didnt win because slightly more people voted for Biden.
MORE 🐂 TODAY. GOOD JOB WSB

not sure tbh. could be any combination of:

\-pathetic desire for recognition

\-poverty induced desperation

im sure theres many more, but thats the basic idea
I'll give you this tip for free: Don't buy anything where there is no room to run. 

Think through your reasoning: You're buying puts on something you know is likely to go down, seems like a brilliant idea, but you have no edge over any other player so that means that the puts will be overly expensive to buy because the sellers aren't going to take the exercise risk for free and if it goes down there's not much further for it to go.

In fact, strangely enough, if you were to make this play you would either buy calls or nothing at all because calls are the only place where there is room to run so then they are the only place where there's a real multiplier to be made. 

Options are about uncertainty, not certainty, so the more certain and less surprising the outcome the more diminished and less rewarding the output; trying to multiply through contract ownership numbers works but it's pointlessly risky; if you can make the same money with $10 as you can with $100 on a long shot you are significantly better off betting the 10 and putting the 90 elsewhere than betting the full 100 and possibly getting nothing or relatively underwhelming results.

TL;DR: Don't bet on things where the outcome is a given. It's fixed dice and the house NEVER loses.
Yeah, but as long as you don't have to be the one in charge of housebreaking the kid that's a win in my book.

Anyone else think this election is gonna be a shit show? I feel like Trump and co are gonna pull out all the stops to keep him in office, even if Biden is the clear winner. If that’s the case then things are gonna get ugly.

Therefore, VXX calls may be the move?
It’s great that u donate it’s not about the dollar amount bro. Keep up the good work and I hope u print hard cause u deserve it
Thing is, that's been doing surprisingly well. JetBlue is on the path to recovery it seems. It also mostly flies domestic routes, so international lockdowns don't affect it as much.

True but the initial uncertainty caused an unprecedented drop, reaching ATH cases won't suddenly make the market plummet more than 30% in 2-3 weeks this time around, there would need to be more going on.  Again, if you want to say we might drop like 10 to even 15% I could see that but don't see 30%+ drop from current levels (which is what a March again would be like).

Wall St does love volatility though. They broke all time trading earnings records this year and the market is up 1.5%.
It’s BCBS.  My max out of pocket is $5k but they refused to cover charges for things they didn’t see as being necessary, like having a private room for a stem cell transplant (no hospital anywhere does this without complete isolation).  And other things along the way, like drugs that were part of a clinical trial.

It’s kinda fucked up.  I’m young and lucid and have a finance background.  They do this shit to elderly people who struggle to advocate for themselves.  Or just regular people like OP who don’t know any better.  It’s really not fair.

The author claims that losing sleep  effects patterns or judgement for trading the next day which is why stock market struggles on Monday's after.  Seems like the biggest load of BS even if you're a bear.  You can find correlation with fucking lunar cycles if you wanted to, do you think wall street traders really struggle because one hour of supposed sleep that they for some reason can't prepare themselves for.  Algos already typically make up 60% of stock transactions anyways... and recently given the high volatility it's likely closer to 80-90% for the last few months...

See my comment below. Wall St was scared shitless of Biden’s primary competition, that doesn’t mean he’s better for them than Trump. Anyway we shall see.
thats a very generous donation of you.

I personally wouldn't count on it, would need to do a full lockdown in US again which seems unlikely.  That doesn't mean this market won't have a large drop of course but you're unlikely to see another 30%+ drop in such a short period of time this time around.
Yes, he will either give Bears or Bulls a stimulus to the toilet when he loses depending on what stocks they hold.
That’s a weird looking muscle
Last month ur right but in October it went up and last week it hasn’t got sold off at all
Or can just look up the crime bill in 1994 or who is running for office was literally a career district attorney 🤔
You forgot this scenario:

Biden Wins presidency: Trump becomes a deficit hawk and veto’s any stimulus legislation for 2+ months while challenging the election results and dragging the transition out for 6 months. Goal is to tank the market and economy to convince people that only he was good for the economy and that stonks going down means no one wants Biden.
🤡
Why would he?
Never sell stocks on a loss. Stocks have infinite time value, unlike options.
Earnings is monday afternoon. Figured with a bad report it would slip a decent amount
Average return you tard.
Yeah, you're retarded. Wall Street is the single largest source of campaign finance. Which means they almost single-handedly decide who has a larger campaign fund.

When they back one candidate BIGLY (with 5x the money going to one candidate), that means they very much want that candidate to win.
Well yeah, he’s not going to fuck with them as badly as Warren, Sanders, etc. Doesn’t mean he won’t fuck with them more than Trump. They were picking their evil.
For delivery? No. If you're not tipping $5 minimum don't fucking bother. Source: delivery app driver
People are turning bullish because everyone has been so bearish the past couple days and they want to inverse the sub. I’m going back to bearish at this point
U are right I think people use it as a safe haven in this sell off actually
My all in SPY puts would offset my DKNG and RKT calls so I’ll maybe break even.
BA 60B in-debt after 6 months. If they don’t take a bail out they’re never going to repay that, even with 100% margins over the next couple years, and will just take on more debt. But watch out for secret fed debt buying through shell companies again.

How bout now
The phrase "The first one's free" is actually a reference to this event. So let's talk about Snapchat again *and* add in a new element: Survivorship Bias; if you went puts on Snapchat you lost it all, but if you're new to the market, you were no more or less likely to bet on Snapchat because you knew what it was but instead you were infinitely less likely to tell everyone that you bet the incorrect direction. 

The difference between this and "Beginner's Luck" is that what I am talking about isn't luck at all, it's ignorance, and in fact one of the strangest things about newbies that you'll hear about here is that people really *do* make large gains and then lose them all. So what causes this? Interest. That's right, interest in the market causes you to lose money! So when you say, "We see day in and out ... result" I am telling you that you only see the results anyone shows you and of course very few people are going to show you their losing ideas. 

So you brought up Costco, and this is a good segway to repeat what I said; they didn't do too hot but someone out there actually did just flip a coin and bet against them for literally little to no reason, maybe they just dislike Costco (I've seen stranger reasons) because they snubbed them and voila, the puts aligned with their sentiment and they won, but they have no idea how it worked out. They'll tell you. The call buyers who did all the DD, sat and read the sheets, did the FCF analysis and read the cash flow statements, thought long and hard on toilet paper demand, etc. won't be saying a thing to you.

In fact if we, as a whole, stopped thinking that winning your first rounds is luck and winning your later rounds is skill we'd all trade better. The reality is that the smaller your pool of companies or services that you know about the easier it is to make financial decisions regarding them because you'll know if you're using whatever more than usual, for instance Zoom, but god only knows if you'll understand how much your using Bristol-Myers-Squibb and what their activities are /were this year. 

This is why the risk function is so bizarre for options because it is a difficult to understand paradox in statistics that explains it well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox

I think in reality you have to consider the value and ratio of the stock secured loan to the value and interest of using it as standard marginable securities.

Vaccine news are tricky. Practically speaking, its unlikely we'll have enough vaccine doses manufactured to fully re-open before 2022. Even then, its doubtful that the country will ever go back to the way it used to be. Damage done to certain industries will be permanent. 

Election winding up is, indeed, bullish - but the big factor there is uncertainty around Trump's behavior around his loss. Too hard to say which way the markets will go in mid-term, but short term there should be a small bounce after Tuesday. After that maybe kang gang till January.
Whole market bout to be a Redzone tomorrow
Agreed, look at Japan’s debt lmao - 240% of GDP and 70% of that is owned by the BANK OF JAPAN. Does that make sense to you? It shouldn’t.

That’s how it’s been for Japan for about 20+ years now. And the Japanese keep going about their day as if the yen has any value at all. It’s crazy what every day citizens will believe because it’s easier than the reality staring at them down a barrel of a gun.
Unprecedented? Literally every time the Republicans leave the administration they leave the country's economy in shambles. Remember 2008? That fucking gong show? The Republicans have brainwashing of their base and failure as their core policies. Along with saying "no" to everything and "blam duh foreigners!!!"

Dude, if you can't handle some typical Republican failure that happens every single time, then you shouldn't be in this business. It's all they do.

North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona will report results Tuesday 7:30pm ish. They can count theirs early so if its a blow-out, they'll know early in those 3 states (Wisconsin might report Tuesday as well):

[https://www.npr.org/2020/10/31/929628299/with-deluge-of-mail-ballots-heres-when-to-expect-election-results-in-6-key-state](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/31/929628299/with-deluge-of-mail-ballots-heres-when-to-expect-election-results-in-6-key-state)

Biden is ahead in Arizona and North Carolina, and has a narrow margin in Florida according to most polls.

Using [this gadget](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-election-map/)...

If Biden wins North Carolina and Arizona but loses Florida, his odds of winning go above 99%. Trump's only path to victory after that is basically winning ALL the other swing states. 

If Biden wins all three, its basically over. Those results would also include McSally and Tillis, two embattled GOP senators, making the blue wave more probable in the senate.

IDK what will happen but don't be surprised if this week is less crazy than you think its gonna be. And if its a quick and easy Biden win, I think the markets might respond very positively to the uncertainty reduction regarding the election.
What's a decent enough tip for ordering pizza?

How the fuck has Plant Fitness not drilled? I tend to laugh off anecdotal evidence and personal experiences, but I go to 3 different ones and they all appear to have about half the traffic they used to and this has been consistent for months now. The locations I go to are in politically red areas too, so I don't see it being purely out of fear.

My only thought is that people are too lazy to cancel and PLNT just keeps charging their accounts. Employees have told me they had tons of cancellations, but I know that doesn't necessarily mean anything outside of my region.

That is beginners luck. The reality is if it that were much higher far more newbies would be baking big gains ... yet we see day in and day out that they are not.

Anybody in this current market has an increased shot at hitting the lotto right now ... but thats luck of the draw. Newbies in general will not pick highly successful trades early on in their investing careers ... unless they get lucky.

>But the reality is that the likelihood of a newbie trader picking an options play that nets them 5k is slim.

No, that's the inverted logic; it is really high. Let's talk about what it means to choose a stock and then the paradox will reveal itself. First things first if we were to look at an earning Calendar for this week let's say that we have 12 per day, 6 premarket and 6 aftermarket announcements so that's a total of 60 companies. Of them probably 8 or less are things you know well enough to actually know what they do without looking it up.

For a novice that means that they were *more* likely to choose Snapchat than say Oxy Petroleum. That's the brutal irony; the less you know and more you stick to what you do know the more likely you'll pick popular or meme-ish high IV companies and the more likely you'll strike. 

This paradox in investing is frustrating for many reasons and many people because for instance Tesla was quiet for years and now Tesla is a meme stock so fundamentally everyone knows about it. Because memetic behavior is *completely random* market participants who are new will run into memetic behavior first and those typically have the wildest and most ridiculous swings.

So what happens is that as you get better and your knowledge of the market becomes broader you are even worse off because you'll bet your money on fundamentals and rational considerations rather than simply informatics which is what drives market prices. It's somewhat like an "innocence lost" paradox.
Imma get that after hours permission now to scratch the itch. But it's not the same without options trading.
Feel like long term gun stock calls will print either way tbh

I do know the gain with options are larger. Which makes them appear to come more quickly. But the reality is that the likelihood of a newbie trader picking an options play that nets them 5k is slim. There is a learning curve with everything. It takes a while with stock or options to start making what most consider “real money” per trade.

I don't know if you have eyes or a brain but you lose momentum after impact you don't gain it. Since you're on wsb you're clearly just retarded so I'll give you a little lesson in physics. 

 Momentum = mass x velocity. Since the impact is on water we can treat it as near frictionless environment and most collision between objects also floating as plastic. So that means if the boat hits something floating it'll gather the object and the the new boat+object has the same momentum as the previous solo boat (with less speed since conservation of momentum applies in our frictionless environment). If the boat hits something stuck to the ground like a pole or a pier we'd have an inelastic collision with lots of energy loss(a lot of slow down in speed) and nothing sticking together (bouncing off each other). So we have the equation massboatxvelocity1 +massobkecthitxvelocty2 = (massboat+massobjecthit)xvelocity3. 

The boat hits a pole that's sank into the ground as it's very first impact at ~6seconds which causes it to turn. This should've significantly reduced the boats speed. The pole did not move so the boat must be slowing down. It then hits the second pole and another boat at ~9 seconds and we can clearly see it moving FASTER than initially after first hit. Therefore the boat must be accelerating.

Yeah because it’s obvious dude, NIO price is like 30 something right now and TSLA price is like 3000 right now; and they both make electric cars, it’s a no brainer 😎 😎 😎

See page 67 of the s/1 for this gem: 

We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree.


Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem the shares of our Class A common stock issued in this offering in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (such that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete our initial business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.

I’m no bull, but if MSFT closes below 200 any day before next earnings, I’d be surprised. Shorted it at 210 & 225 this summer. Got to 196.25 for a moment, but still closed @ 202. Flirted with it lately, but now long 195 again on Friday. Most confident trade I made last week. Considering I’m getting slaughtered in my TUP short at the moment. Who’da thunk?

The best expiry would be the one closest so 0dte or Nov 30.

The best strike price would be almost impossible to tell you; an ITM would be safest and wisest but an OTM within a certain threshold would be the most profitable. However this is speculative because it also depends on when the price is struck and how far beyond that price it goes; if you went 0dte or Nov 30 at 25 and the price on that day was 26 you'll be doing better than if you went only with 20 but at the same time if you're in the same boat and the price is 24 it is possible people will rapidly abandon the decaying value of the option.

Something something theta converges with gamma to produce a real value for the option yatta yatta the instant of actual value is the only one that matters.

But I don't think you're actually asking this. What do you really want to know? Like, I assume you asked this with some form of risk appetite in place that isn't literally max +1.
I over leveraged & lost 11k of my gains. It looks really bad rn but I could turn out fine who knows.

I played the runup but didn't sell because I got greedy. 2 call plays made 2.4k then the day of earnings just killed it all.
I liked this stock a lot better at $13. Sold it back in February at $54. It’s overhyped, tech is overbought in general and the revenue won’t justify the price it’s currently at for years. 

I was hugely bullish on Amd for years but I think the play has run its course.

On 11/6 Uber earnings will not yet be released, and this also doesn't give a large enough span of time for the case that Prop 22 passes, which would cause Uber to go up. Either Prop 22 fails, or Prop 22 passes, and Uber becomes embroiled in legal battles over it in the next few months. Uber is also projected to have poor earnings.   


The point is, 11/6 doesn't give you enough time to fully take advantage of catalysts such as legal battles, the results of the election, and earnings.  


If you are GAMBLING on the results of Prop 22, that is the only reason to do 11/6, but I would not recommend it.
Thoughts on PayPal? Might pop on earnings

if there is a clear winner on either side we are likely to gap up on Wednesday, if the polls are showing a likely winner on Tuesday we might see a small rally, tomorrow may be the last chance to get in after Friday’s sell off, or who knows, the election could be too close to call or disputed and we see the market go down another 10%, it’s a gamble either way, I’m hoping for a clear winner on Tuesday night and a massive rally the rest of the week

The problem with options is that gains *do* come over night. Snapchat, you put in $334 on an OTM call expiring that week and you'd have awakened to a 15x gain of $5,000. A lot of people have this wrong; trading in the short-term, that is, single iterative behavior, is not equivalent to knowledge based trading for the long-term, that is, multiple iterations over time.

You are significantly better off trying to turn $300 into $5,000 if you're going to do this in singular iterations (which all of you do; the continuous version of this is not a thing here, just to be clear) than you are trying to turn $2,000 into $5,000. Options have a strange understanding of risk but basically the risk is non-linear.

Thing is big tech will always thrive. Look at their earnings, revenue, pile of cash on Balance sheet. Little to no debt..

Until a new disruptive technology emerges (in what form we do not know) - whatever big comes out of internet/robotics/AI space/Data, big tech will absorb it right away. It's all about data. Something interesting will emerge, and it will be bought right away. Why do you think these companies have more cash than most countries combined.

Sure they can go lower in the short run but what do you think is going to happen a year from now.

Do we think MSFT adding 8-10% rev growth on a 40bn revenue company will be $100 per share? Kingpin Bezos? Daddy Cook? Zuck?

If big tech was supposed to go down, they should have been broken apart already. It is too late now. Only thing that can disrupt is a complete new technology - the way green tech reshaping energy industry.

3.  Does it show profit?  If no, go back to #1.  If it's profitable  ->  trade it and don't stray from the rules followed in back test.  Record all trades, in detail.

r.  Start at #1 again so you have several strategies in your toolbox.

Nio has alot of volume so its gonna be prone to some big dips and big spikes. that may be something you might want to think about when it comes to that ticker specifically, and other hype / front page stocks

Fair point, 5k for chasing dividends is pretty low. I think the reason i would start small like that is to see how it would work at first. I agree with your averaging down on SPY and also VIX as both viable strategies for both the short and long term.
Where abouts in BC?
Premium for pits on spy amd qqq are def higher than if you play specific tickers. But prob still pay out good if u get the move u lookimg for

So, weird kind of idea, thinking about throwing 5k at a extremely high dividend stock while also hedging with puts because a lot of these high dividend yield tickers are garbage companies fundamentally, using my dividends to pick up some some SPY 2021 LEAPS 10% OTM as I’m pretty sure the S&P will probably dip even more post election.
We can actually check this ourselves with a quick little experiment: 

An ATM call a few weeks out on QQQ (QQQ 270c 11/20) has an IV of 40.45%, a bid ask spread of ~40 cents, and requires a 3.93% gain to break even. 


That same ATM call for TQQQ (TQQQ 117c 11/20) has an IV of 110.48%, bid-ask spread around 2 dollars, and a break even point of +10.78%.


I’m sorry to tell you this, but you’re retarded.

The market dipped 10% after the last contested election in 2000. This was pre: 9/11, wars, geopolitical tensions, covid, QE, record debt,  etc.  We probably will not find out the results of the election until possibly a week later and if this is a contested election I sure as hell don’t see a drop in volatility.  Further there are extremist on both sides of the political environment so I suspect protests/riots if either candidate wins.  Not promoting fear but is something to be concerned.  Good luck and Bless 🇺🇸

A lot of times it is. You’re thinking too much like an engineer. It’s not always about the having the best product. For sales it’s about what can you produce and sell to capture the appropriate amount of the market in respect to your costs. AMD isn’t going to put NVDA or intel out of business. That’s not what I’m saying. What I’m saying is they have a legitimate shot at taking a much larger market share than they currently have.

"it goes down in the DM"
I opened my brokerage account in January with like $300. I bought PGE stock and did nothing until August  then I deposited 11k and started buying options. The first big one I bought was a Tesla call before the stock split. My account went from 11.5k to 24k overnight. Then amazon options took all those gains back and more. So now I lay here waiting for my next fix. But I’ve gotten lucky on FSLY, TSLA, HTZ just gotten fucked from AMZN and holding my options too long
why would you want them to only sleep with you? they would probably even let you fuck them.
Maybe the cities, but Eastern and Northern California is heaven
At least sell some to free up cash on the side. I'm considering that rn...
I think it will just be a bumpy ride.  If the election is a blue landslide we'll have some upward momentum.  If it's a contested election, it will be downward pressure.  Coronavirus is downward pressure.

So uncontested Biden win, bumpy ride, sideways or slightly up.

Contested election, GTFO.
Other factors you retard. Global lockdowns and a pandemic. When other countries are going into a lockdown again it doesn’t make sense that the market would be green since last time it happened it tanked. Your market indicator is nothing more than a look at a graph and a correlation that is shit.

I think you should either hold them and not check on them at all the next week or you should try and time reentry into a lower strike if you are an absolute degenerate. Personally I have lower strikes for the same date and they have been bleeding but I just don’t care. I don’t think this week is predictable at all and I expect it to be super volatile. My personal move would be to flip it to a spread with lower strikes if you want to to stem the bleed and make it a more achievable win for the same date. Maybe close the 130 and open a 105/135 spread for the same price or something.
thats how you get double losses.

There it goes without evidence. It’s always convenient to paint a narrative that fits. Lay the ground work so if you do lose it’s cause of fraud. If you don’t win enough it’s cause of fraud. It’s impossible that at least half the country disagrees with you. Also what’s with this cult like ideology around trump? If it’s not a vote for him it’s not a vote for America? Lol how?

Well whatever the Federal Reserves plan is, all 4 of those boxes better have the exact same written. The Fed is required and mandated to be politically neutral.

just remember one thing and keep reminding yourself this everyday

"Time heals everything"

like everyone said indulge yourself in things you like doing and love yourself first!
And what I am saying is that just because it has been right so far in a very small group. Does not mean it is an actual indicator. The amount of outside factors you are ignoring is ridiculous. They aren’t your words but you are defending them. If you believe this you also would probably believe that the amount of pirates shows how global temperatures will be, more pirates colder weather.

Because large institutions that control billions of shares are the major influence on the market.  And they can guess what the idiot RH traders with their hive mind are doing and make money off of them.  It's not a conspiracy, just the smart money being smart.
I'm holding AAPL shares. I would nut everywhere if it goes 130 but i know it's not realistic.
Where did I say anything about "good black man" or not holding terrorists accountable, or letting them in?  If anything, the sources I cited prove the exact opposite.

I already clarified that, just like some of us in this sub and on Wall Street who are not one of his insiders, I only want Trump out (what is most likely what you kneejerked against) **because of his blatant non-stop stock market manipulation,** NOT because of his policies on the war on terror.

Keep in mind that this is a gambling sub, not politics.

Using literature as a metaphor. Be the author of your own story, don't let a minimal character change the end of your novel. Make this moment the inciting incident of your life where you as the main character change, grow and become the best version of yourself. Acknowledge the positive you learned form relationship, and move forward.

The big short. A movie about how the market can be irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Would be more of a sign that the market will rally this week. And for the next couple months. Just to say ‘fuck you poor retail investors’. Then once you’re chasing upward. Pull the rug hard af.

I don’t think they have a choice on where to do many aspects of their business, if tax loopholes are closed to make it actually a penalty to outsource USA jobs; so what if mansion values deflate? Your premises are already proven wrong by all economic results since the 1980’s.

Interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.

It’s really hard to consider this as this girl was your focal point for a year, but there literally millions of other girls, of which there are statistically going to be a ton of matches that are probably even better for you. I’m guessing you’re young, so you’ve got a ton of time.
1,000 is more that 999.
But 999 is more that 100 or 199! Think BIGGER MAN

Yo why does a lot of people here think there’s this big bad “mm” behind the scenes pulling the strings? 😂
With the GEX negative and the DIX at 43.6% there is a pretty good chance for a nice run up on Monday.  With MMs short so many puts they have a tendency to try and push the market up (see Friday's close).  With the MMs being short Gamma, if the market does run up, they have no choice but to buy shares into the rally to balance their Deltas, forcing it up more.... either way there is a decent chance for an up day.
I have 0 doubt diamond hands is initiated tomorrow
Just as u/burrowed_greentext said go to the gym. Yeah sure cry and grieve about it for a few days but then it’s time to harden the fuck up and move forward with your life. My ex slut cheated on me in September and fucked me up bad, still kinda sad about it but I started going to gym 6 days a week and finally starting to see results. You just gotta fall in love with yourself bro

Edit: also just get super drunk one night so you can handle deleting all the pics of her. Unfollow her and her friends on social media so you don’t get reminded of her.

I know you can be a landlord for farmers.  Maybe you could just buy a plot of land (write off as buisness expense) and then rent the acerage out to farmers.  I also have 0 experience doing this so verify anything with your CPA.

What I do to make my property a “farm property” is ‘rent’ ($1/year) my land out to a honey farmer.  He just set up a small beehive on the far side of the property and it doesnt bother me at all, but we have massive tax benefits for being a “farm” rather than a “residence”

Dems realized they just handed Trump a giant slush fund. Dems got pissed. Another stimulus bill will not have the same effect. I guarantee it

So best case scenario for stonks this week is winner wins by a landslide and controls the house and senate right?

Warrants give you the right to buy a common share later down the road.

In psth case. The strike price is for $23.

So if you have 500 warrants, and it ends up being stripe, you can exercise those if you want at any time until expiration, which is usually 3 to 5 years. 

Warrants trade just like commons do. Say psth merges with stripe, and the commons go to $50, you can bet the warrants are worth around $25+.

You can sell the warrants themselves, or exercise them and pay $23 for each share.

Do you think that the executives making millions of dollars are driving the economy? You’re about to find out who actually has been driving the economy. It’s middle range people of income, that right now don’t have savings, as wages haven’t increased meaningfully in over a decade. We’re sitting on a powder keg right now. But yeah “taxes bad, alwayz, twickle downs economix”. You do you. 

This is a casino. I can be right, and still make money off this if market goes down. So can you. It’s not a football game. I’ve been bullish in a fake hot market because I knew it was fake. I switched to calls and netted 200% on my full account last week. Friday I went back into long calls to sell on the short term, as I am betting on a fake pump as if all our problems are solved this week at some point. I know it’s bs. 

You may not though it seems. Let’s see how it works for our accounts in a week and trade notes.

America is a consumer driven economy. Corporate tax closing of loopholes and the impossible fiscal irresponsibility of the current administration will yeah, have a shift in markets, but that will be offset by consumer spending, and a middle class. Removing wage gap will make economy boom. Having income inequality the sort that is developing will lead to a depression- and frankly if savings metrics are any indication - it already probably has... It’s not like this hasn’t happened in American history before. Easy to find. You can look it up.

I’m not, more an enthusiast but applicable to my current career as ML will likely augment everything I do in the next 10 years. CUDA may be better than AMDs product for now and yes it’s more widely used but NVDA is valued over triple what AMD is and if AMD can even take away a fraction of their market share their valuation will soar. That’s what I’m getting at. NVDA is on the top of the pedestal for the commercial market and AMD is taking shots at them and Intel and I think they’ll take some market share soon. Both valued way higher than AMD which seems crazy given that they are much closer to becoming to disrupting the market than they were 5 years ago

Oil and Coal are already on the way out. The only reason why they are still prevalent was Bush administration was up to their neck in global contracts and investments in the industry. But you think they’re going to shut off the oil pumps in the next 4 years? No. I could see a reduction in subsidy. But moving away from fossil fuels is a power move vs other countries that are relying on it for their main economical power. Corporate tax hikes is a broad term, and I don’t think it’s going to be a “hey you all pay more taxes”. I could see stipulation to close tax loopholes for tax cheats though. I could also see tax rates for those in the 500k and up range take a lift. They’re not driving consumer economy (by all evidence from the last 50 years) so who f-ing cares Karen can’t buy another spare Benz for her summer home in the Hamptons.

the amount of people i’ve seen post pictures and videos on their snapchat at parties that are absolutely packed is insane. people really said covid doesn’t exist anymore huh.
No you buy them both. Let me give you an example of a trade.

You have 4000 dollars and lets assume spy is at 325 this Monday. A straddle is the purchase of the call and put at the same strike price. This is 0 day to expiration so the calls and puts cost 1.20 each.

This allows you to buy 16 calls of spy 11/02 at 325 and 16 puts of spy 325 11/02. Total cost $3,840. You check back at 1pm and spy is at 330. Your spy calls are worth 500 dollars each while the spy puts are at 10 dollars(lost nearly all there value). (500+10)*16=$8160+160 dollars we left on the table. Your account is now worth $8,320 a 108% gain.

Lets run it again and say monday selloff happens. Spy is at 315 by 1pm, with this method you dont give a shit a movement of spy in either direction is money for you. 

Your spy puts are worth 1100 dollars(iv will spike this if that's the case if not just factor in 1025-1050) for you and the calls like 5 bucks. (1100+5)*16=17680+160= account balance is $17,840 a 346% gain.

Finally lets say it just moves 3 dollars down (a gain is a gain)
Spy is at 322 so your spy puts are worth  300 dollars, your calls down to 30 bucks or so. (300+30)*16=5280+160=$5,440 a 36% gain.

I edited in percent change.

You brought up Airbnb out of nowhere to lie and pretend like Ackman didn’t want them because of their books when Ackman made it clear he was very interested but they said no and favor a traditional IPO.
> 
> There’s only one of us here in denial. You can’t admit that Airbnb didn’t want PSTH because you’re invested in PSTH so you have to try and spin it as Airbnb wasn’t good enough even though Ackman and Airbnb both said otherwise.
> 
> Meanwhile I don’t own either company so it’s clear who the fan boy is. I just like actual facts. Ackman admitted he never saw the Airbnb financials but was very interested. It was clearly his top choice since it was his immediate acquisition attempt after starting PSTH.
> 
> But keep comparing the company Ackman most wanted to buy (which people have been waiting to IPO for almost ten years) to Hertz and AMC 🤡 I have to wonder why you’d invest your money with Ackman if you don’t trust his first choice for an acquisition target...
> 
> Luckily Ackman is a major Hilton investor so he knows hotels have gotten destroyed by Airbnb and he doesn’t need some PSTH fan boy on WSB to tell him that he shouldn’t invest in it 😂

Best results: doesn’t matter who wins but they win by landslide, or at least to the point where outstanding ballots are pointless to be counted. This will allow market direction. Personally if Blue takes house, senate and presidency, I am *Super Duper Bullish* for stock market, as the maximum stimulus will pass, in January. November and December were already set up to be something of a wash anyway, though, and consumer spending tanking could (and will tank) the markets in some sectors.

And they think your trendies should be taken from you to pay for their universal basic income and gender reassignment surgeries.
I’d be willing to bet and I’ll probably look into this more but a large portion of Snapchat’s most frequent users aren’t old enough to drive or have bank accounts, that’s why advertising revenue isn’t that high and more importantly why I don’t see future prospects to be that high unless they have an explosion in the number of users

Can someone tell me what election results is best and worst for short term stock market
When you say retire early, you mean at the age of \~45 instead of 65, right? Unless your sister (or anyone) has an opportunity to make (minimum) $80,000/year, they should be aggressive as fuck in their "investing" strategy and go the WSB route, not the /r/financialindependence route. Most people can barely save $20,000/year. If you start with $20,000 and add $20,000/year, **and** you average 11%/year (unlikely) it'll take you just about 25 years to reach $2 million after tax (also by then $2 million isn't worth $2 million). I don't think almost any 18 year old can or should expect that. Most people hit $2 million by age \~60, not by age 43 (unless they have a comfortable 6-figure white collar tech job).

In short: options and/or day trading are the way to go **for most people**. Fuck your 11% average. I'm up about 84% in 10 months.

>...if Trump wins the election, expect a small rally on Wednesday since 1) the market likes a Republican victory and 2) we will have more of the same, something that the market likes: stability. However, if Biden wins, expect the market to dip. 

I get the thesis that continuity = incumbent creates more stability. And repub candidates are typically more market-friendly. But I'm not sure that's true with Trump. How does it stabilize markets to elect a president who literally hasn't announced a plan for a 2nd term? Biden, despite the tax increase, may present more stability. 

Also, there's no path to victory for trump that concludes by the end of the week. He needs margin victories in multiple states where he's behind in the polls so any Trump win is long and involves many lawyers. Perhaps a recount. Only Biden can win fast.

Honestly her risk tolerance is high and just make sure to emphasize that the stock market is basically a legal casino in which you can minimize or maximize risk based on research you do and luck. Give her tips and have her try with paper trading. If you want make her a paper trading account on TOS and tell her to get from 5k to 25k. She then might realize how hard it is actually to get consistent gains. And obviously rules

1.stay away from pump and dumps/stocks with low value(Ex:hertz)
2.don’t trade on margin bc debt is a bitch
3. Don’t trade low volume options 
4.only trade like a percentage of your portfolio 
5.make a semi decent trading plan and stick to it
6. If she does start making a profit once she trades options tell her to withdraw her initial investment and every month withdraw like 500-1k and put towards long term retirement. 

Hopefully this helps

Don’t think Elon disliked the short sellers. In fact I think he enjoyed them. It helped his stock become fueled by higher and higher prices. Interestingly enough he also knew when to pull the trigger and sell his companies stock for the highest premium on share price right before those prices came down. Pretty sure he was happy about it all and he played it like an inside man.

EQNR. Those offshore wind turbines in the picture, thats Equinor’s design.

Depends on the ticker, Greeks, and IV. If there is a huge IV spike, I will sell them a little further out. I try to stick with 1-2 weeks out though as they seem to be the best returns.
Do they though? Biden has been raking in the cash for months but Trump has had to pull ads from multiple swing states for lack of funds. I keep hearing the big money donors have dried up on the Republican side.

I can relate to this as I am always asking for money to buy more stocks.
It looks like you're doing some kind of a buy and hold strategy? If that's the case stop fomoing at ATH. All you had to do was wait for a sharp dump (SPY low 320's) and then buy in. You have no theta decay to worry annoy, spy will pull everything back up in the near future because stocks only go up.

I've been buying up NOVS stock for that reason... It's a SPAC for the Appharvest IPO, while not a "water company", they're a Vertical Farming company in the more water rich region of Appalachia; indoor farms require 90% less water than traditional agriculture, and the West and Southwest will get hammered by droughts, making Appharvest a good hedge on climate risk.
Thanks for this advice mane! So just to be clear, when you buy, you’re only buying calls and not puts along with it right? Because typically straddle means both so just making sure. I have $1k to play with rn trying to get my account up there so I can make better plays with bigger stocks

Of course they aren't a country. That is why it was particularly evil of Obumber to destroy the Libyian leadership and replace it with your legacy of woman raping savages. I'll give you a hint, those people have always existed since the dawn of humanity. Barbarians have always existed on the outskirts of society. Which is why you close the gates to them.

Terrorism is way more under control than during the Obama years. Obama dropped 100k bombs on them and pissed them off. Trump is way more liberal peaceloving than Obama but your goo goo ga ga smooth baby brain is unable to detach from "good black man" and rawly analyze statistics.

I would think with a contested election you can expect a sell off or trade sideways.
He'd have to win by some colossal ridiculous amount I think

Election is gonna be contested if it's close at all in either way imo, and that kind of uncertainty surely isn't good

I think the chances of us finding out who actually won on election day are slim to none
For the original question, I don’t think it would be too hard to find an indicator that predicts all the past elections but does not predict this one. At the end, there is an infinite number of indicators but only a fine number of elections. There are infinite indicators since we can create random indicators, let’s just make one up: number of political adds aired six months before the election. Another one? GDP drop of 1% or more 2.5 months before elections, etc.
Stupid news, he apparently bought the 3400 / 3500 FD spx call spreads expiring this week last Monday (!). Yes, it *was* $300 millionen when he bought. It's probably down 80% now, so maybe 60 million left if he's lucky.

Hydrogen is the new Oil... Europe has so much offshore wind farms, they're now using the excess energy capacity to create hydrogen fuel.  Now China is racing ahead to try and dominate another growing industry...  It could also be that Europe and China no longer want to rely on a dirty fuel that's mainly produced by unstable and despotic regimes.... All while the US is being left behind, while supporting a dying industry.  If Biden wins, start investing in Hydrogen businesses... Gonna look into options tomorrow for the following:

Somehow I feel that when it’s so easy to read the market, it’s always wrong. Everything points to a bad start on Monday but I think it will end positive.
Mathematician here, this can be strictly correct *if you ignore any additional knowledge*, you define an event, without any additional information yes 50/50. You can then define what the action of eating 100 hotdogs is. Is it a meal comprised of 100 parts or an event happening 100 times. If the former, then 50/50, same as what’s the probability of eating 100 rice seeds in a rice meal? IDK 50/50. If we are assuming the person has the option of not eating a hotdog, then definitely not 50/50. But then what if we define the person as being able to chose between several different actions, like go watch TV, sleep, walk, yawn, stretch, what to eat, or weather or not to take a bite of the current hot dog, etc. then the probability of any human ever eating two hotdogs would be infinitely small. So net-net, probabilities don’t help much unless the problem is correctly framed, which is unfortunately out of the realm of probability theory itself.
It would be better to trade by selling 1 single credit spread and seeing if we drop further, You need to try to sell options when we have dropped a lot, not a little, we need to see if we will drop a lot next week, If we do drop a lot next week, then you would sell premium on options to idiots here on WSB..

#SO, think of it this way, you should TRADE AFTER the big moves, not before the big moves..

The only problem is, you NEED the BIG moves to be up first if you want to sell Credit Call spreads, and you NEED the BIG moves to be down if you want to sell Credit Put Spreads...

Understand?


#by selling options right now, you are risking too much, you want to see how the big guys will push/pull the market to somewhere first, then you trade off of them..
Yes sir

The bid ask spreads
Playing 0dte spy strangles at the money is the best play for me. Those cost about 100 dollars a call or put. If spy moves 1.50+ in either direction you are making about 20-40%(40% if its one of those massive green candles that spikes iv too). Anything more than 1.50 and you are rolling in nice profit. Also lets you spin the wheel of getting a 1%or more negative spy day that will make massive profit without risking your entire investment. If you are lucky enough to have a -1%-3% day on spy like before you are going to make 2 to 5 times the amount of initial investment. Most loss that occurs its when spy kang gang its way for 1 hour or 2 before picking a direction, but those loses are usually max 8% for me as i hold till profit. Usually in a couple of hours after buying.

Also fyi every single monday for the past month if I hold till 1-2pm is a minimum 100% rate of return. The one time i sold my spy straddle early for 50% it kept climbing and was worth 300% total investment at end of day. Wednesdays are usually 10-15% as they have been relatively flat/kang ganging. While Fridays are like mini mondays when I will make 40% ish.

I think the market is going to moon after the election, doesn't matter who wins. The biggest problem is uncertainty. Once it becomes clear who the winner is money on the sidelines will move in. It'll have a more clear direction on where to go.

Not as many people may not be dying as you would like but it still wreaks havoc on your body. My friend’s roommate caught it months ago and he still has trouble breathing while walking up the two flights of stairs to get to their apartment, keep in mind he was an extremely active guy beforehand. There is also a high possibility that there are even longer term issues we don’t even know about yet. But even then, I’m sure none of the friends and family of the 224,000 Americans who have needlessly died of this virus would agree with you on anything you have said regarding this pandemic
What exactly am I looking at here.

Thats their shlong dude. But u can try milk that once your calls go to 0 mate.
The only hope you have is that you’ll be so buried in it you won’tveven realize there is anything else
Anyone else pooping and reading this nonsense?
Ok, lets think about this critically.  We Literally just had 3rd quarter earnings in which what did the market do? well? went down, for a many number of reasons, profit taking, getting out before elections, etc etc..

So, now we have elections, and 4th quarter earnings..

So therefore, people want to buy after the next sell-off/correction.

So why are people anxious to jump in the market now during 3+ months and more covid coming as well as no vaccine and no stimulus and a possible civil unrest election etc..

So What my point is, is that we will probably slowly head down a little more from here, and then on the stimulus or Vaccine news, is when we start heading up and rallying back up again..

That is my "GUESS", what will really happen is going to be according to how the big guys can steal/take money away from the little guys.. that is what really will happen..
Gotcha thank you

So a person who would be fine without the virus but then dies gets it second hand from a person who wants a drink at bar? 2 percent of the GDP in nyc is the restaurant industry. 10 percent death rate? That’s your cut off? 

World’s wealthiest nation, the worlds powerhouse for military production can’t even make enough ppe to protect front line employees. It’s a joke. 

There are responsible ways to curb the virus to a manageable level with targeted shutdowns and fiscal support for the business and employees affected and keep people safe.

1.  Pre-election stimulus being a sham all along.  The closer we got to it, the less chance of it happening.  Like theta burn on your Calls.

2. Institutions staying cash by selling the (obvious) news of tech companies beating earnings during a pandemic because everyone who was dumb enough to buy through this election is now holding the bags.
Drinking a lot?
Polling would suggest otherwise. Polling is much more favorable towards Biden this time around than it was with Clinton. 

As well, lots of old people who vote in Florida, not too happy with Trump right now because of the coronavirus. Given Trump’s favorability compared to Biden, I think Biden is definitely leading with independents.

I think trump will contest regardless (slight margin = recount fake news, landslide = rigged fake news) but I think you're right about the market. The only issue here is if the markets will react to a revolt and people shooting each other / burning down buildings.

With COVID cases getting higher and people still out of work, they have nothing else to do so I'm hoping people start burning shit down, it's gonna make my puts print $$$

#Ok, so this is only 3 Dow Futures bought and held maybe a week.

#What you need to see is this:

#The Trade price bought was at 27039 and 27045.  So roughly very close to each other as you can see there, (2 futures were bought at 27039 and 1 future was bought at 27045)

#The Dow futures are currently at 26503 as you can see..


#SO, with 3 single futures, (NOT OPTIONS) But just single futures, you can lose/make $8000 from a small 542 point move on the DOW Jones!

#as you well know, we will move much more than 500 points on the Dow jones in the next week..

#so, that will be either $8000 up or down further if you were to buy 3 single futures right now..

"#But that's not 20k in a day!", You say right??

#well, now I will tell you that you can trade options on the futures! ( I do not like trading options on the futures, I like selling options on the futures, but never-the-less, you can trade WSB options on the futures!


#So now your answer involves either buying 7-10 single futures implying a 500 point move up on election day for the $20,000, or just buying a few calls as you well know how options work if you are on WSB right?

#You know darn well we will be way higher or way lower than 26500 in a week from now buddy.. so those who bought, or are waiting to buy futures, (you can short futures too if you absolutely know its going down from here) will make at least $5000-10,000 profit or LOSS on election movement this next 2 days..

Now that i think about it.. work bonus probably the easiest.

It isn't the virus destroying the economy, it's the piss-poor handling of the situation by the administration. Other countries have kept their cases down to practically nothing with virtually no impact to their economy while we're running around like a bunch of retards screaming about money and muh feelings.
When I originally became your all time favorite autist, the Great State of WallStreetBets was hemorrhaging tendies. Loss porn was everywhere and brains were full of ridges and grooves. Margin calls and account shutdowns were abundant. No cases of autism for decades. I stopped that. Now tendies are limitless, brains are smooth, and autism is running rampant.
Watch Florida on election night. Since they will most likely have full results by 8-9pm on that night. 

If Biden wins it, Trump has 100% lost in a landslide because if Biden has Florida, he definitely got MI, WI, and PA as well. If Trump wins FL, still anybody’s game.

No legitimately contesting an election for Trump if he loses Florida. So market will react extremely positively to a no contest election and a dem sweep that will give a big stimulus.

don't worry they already hate me because I haven't lived upto expectations
I agree with the sentiment, however if there’s a democratic sweep, that implies larger stimulus let’s say in February. How long does it take for that to become priced in?
Try visiting r/trump, that place is interesting.
Literally Florida, which is a purple state, so yes there will be a clear winner on election night if it’s a landslide.

I remember a week ago Xilinx said AMD wasn't buying them.  Don't trust anyone.
I was pretty pissed at that last minute pump on Friday EOD because it made me hold my puts over the weekend. Think it might have been a blessing in disguise though.
Lol we are responding to a post about PSTH targeting Stripe when Ackman said they are not mature enough. You brought up Airbnb out of nowhere to lie and pretend like Ackman didn’t want them because of their books when Ackman made it clear he was very interested but they said no and favor a traditional IPO.

There’s only one of us here in denial. You can’t admit that Airbnb didn’t want PSTH because you’re invested in PSTH so you have to try and spin it as Airbnb wasn’t good enough even though Ackman and Airbnb both said otherwise.

Meanwhile I don’t own either company so it’s clear who the fan boy is. I just like actual facts. Ackman admitted he never saw the Airbnb financials but was very interested. It was clearly his top choice since it was his immediate acquisition attempt after starting PSTH. 

But keep comparing the company Ackman most wanted to buy (which people have been waiting to IPO for almost ten years) to Hertz and AMC 🤡 I have to wonder why you’d invest your money with Ackman if you don’t trust his first choice for an acquisition target...

Luckily Ackman is a major Hilton investor so he knows hotels have gotten destroyed by Airbnb and he doesn’t need some PSTH fan boy on WSB to tell him that he shouldn’t invest in it 😂

It gets weird man. There’s actually some interesting data showing certain professions like Auctioneers have higher net worth than a lot of doctors, because doctors feel obligated to take other people out, whereas most people don’t realize that auctioneers can do very well, so they don’t look at them like ATMs
If Florida goes to Biden, it’s game over for Trump, he’s lost in a landslide no contesting that. If Trump wins Florida it’s anybody’s game still. 

Since Florida will most likely have full results on November 3rd it will be a good indication of where the election is heading, that is why.

That's because Republicans believe in smaller government. So states have more responsibility/say. If Democrats are in control you can expect federal lockdowns
Lemme know if you find out where to see that info
Logically what you said does make sense. However I’m not really in it for $220 a week. If I were going to sell Monday I would probably pick a strike of either $16 or $16.50 depending on how Norwegian opens. I probably won’t trade this week due to the election, I’m not sure how the market is going to react. But at $16, I’m at $77 per contract for a total of $1,026. My break even would be around $15.26.

- these are in general for before the 4th quarter, not necessarily on the day of or around the election but in general where they should go..

Vix at 45

BA at 135

Apple is at it's low right now or if breaks lower from here, expect $104 or even $100-ish

SPXL at $42

- SPY lowest would be $240 but that is EXTREME LOW.. the more realistic low is SPY $290..

- High would be $385 but that is Extreme High and more realistic high would be $365
Did you buy out of the money at the top?

Bad idea. Like all of it. Parents you could confide in, but no one outside immediate family should know financial details. And ironically, giving something like an expensive gift makes them more resentful. If you're going ahead I would suggest maybe something really low key like a couple of dinners at a nice restaurant or a scuba diving lesson or a family weekend ski resort or something that won't cause questions.

We can, but when you claim the left is worse while the right calls any facts it doesn't like "fake news" I'm going to call bullshit. Prop 16, which is currentlyfailing, does not compare to the president using military police to detain protestors illegally.

Both sides are nuts, but the demands for ideological purity are stronger in the right.  I mean, unless you're going to call the presidency not one of "our institutions"
Wouldn’t the ‘9’ key be more beneficial?

This is old outlook. Update: Trump won election by landslide victory close out all put short positions Monday morning. Market is going to start factoring it in.    Monday is liftoff Tuesday is the moon wed outer space. By Friday alpha Centauri. Nothing but dead bears. Bulls on parade. Calls on everything .          

Old prediction: Tuesday big red. Tuesday afternoon looks like Trump is going to sweep market goes green. Wed rocket ship to space 1,400 point gain on the Dow.
It’s not like Uber at all. Uber relies on underpaid gig economy workers to exist. Airbnb creates revenue streams for people who have extra space to rent. Uber drivers probably don’t even make minimum wage a lot of the time versus Airbnb hosts who can easily make six figures a year if they rent out one or two places.

When your business model isn’t built on exploiting workers, you have a lot less pressure from governments. Airbnb spent the last five years making agreements with most major cities so the regulatory risk would be minimal. That’s why they didn’t rush to IPO when it was rumored every year.

Hotels are paying massive leases and debts while business travel isn’t expected to bounce back for 4-10 years by most estimates. Meanwhile Airbnb has more reservations than ever before due to people working from home in Airbnb’s for weeks or months at a time during COVID. The pandemic gave them cover to cancel a few unprofitable initiatives to focus on the big moneymakers like rentals and experiences. Now they’re gaining market share while Hilton tries to figure out which properties to close and how to pay their debts. I was just reading an article last night about all the luxury hotels (including Hiltons etc) that won’t reopen in NYC after this with Broadway shut down, Times Square shut down, etc
I hope you’re not serious about the EU banks.

short maybe, long absolutely not.
McConnell has never acted in trumps best interest. Mitch McConnell acts in Mitch McConnells best interest. For example the stimulus. Furthermore, Mitch has gotten a lot of what he has been pushing for his whole career via trump. Young conservative judges, a decrease in corporate taxes(McConnell’s wife has a substantial family business) while getting shit on by trump for the majority of trumps presidency. Why has he completely switched his opinion on stimulus? In March/April he was fully down for stimulus, now right before the election his opinion changed. Why do something like this when the election is right on the doorstep, especially with jpows comments on the necessity for stimulus? He got everything he wanted out of trump and now he no longer needs him.
You bought many of these stocks at pretty high prices ... $WORK at 34, BA at 171, AAPL at 130, NFLX at 500 ... To put my statement in perspectives, I sell puts on $NFLX at 380, BA at 130, AAPL at 100.

I don't think it's layers exactly, I think it's dimensional.

For example, the average WSB user has 2 or sometimes 3 dimensional autism. If you take a truly extraordinary sample like Michael Burry, he doesn't have depth perception, but he does have 7D autism.

There higher the dimension of autism you are capable of operating in, the more likely you are to make a great investment such as GME 45C 11/20.

When we stopped cancer treatment on my mom I made sure to ask her all the weird questions before she went, like if she was scared to die, what she thought was gonna happen, her regrets and best moments. It's awkward but you'll never get a second shot, and you'll feel like *they* are more ready to die when they talk about that stuff. It keeps the grief process greased up and moving.

As far as maturity, I felt the same way. I’m a college student and I don’t use the app as much anymore but, it’s still all people use here. At the end of the day it’s just easier and less of a commitment than texting. It’s also easier to add people. It’s also easier to keep contacts and photos. Stuff in your iPhone doesn’t always transfer. As far as monetization, I think there’s a lot of stuff they could do, given that the retention rate of users is so high. Just throw ads in front of people and companies will pay lol. I also have no doubt in my mind in Snapchat’s ability to come up with new things that keep people on the app. How far away is snap map from becoming your GPS? How far away is the ability to send money to people through Snapchat? Contacts is everything for that, and everybody has all their contacts in snap as opposed to people’s phone numbers.
old blue?
Lol not at all😂🐂🐂☠️☠️☠️
Haha thats not how anything works not even flipping a coin.
Everyone agrees pelosi doesn’t like trump but I have a strong suspicion McConnell likes him even less. And people think pelosi wants a bigger stimulus for the American people meanwhile her husband is millions of dollars deep in stocks/options. There’s a reason why she’s pushing that big of a stimulus and it’s not for the people. Neither party really cares about you. 11/3p on America

To be fair to the 60/40 portfolio - any manager worth dick will not have you in treasury bonds within the ‘40’ section, and will usually use a combo of high quality corporates, preferreds, high yield, maybe some MBS thrown in too. The 60/40 isn’t for someone who is the average wallstreetbets user with infinite risk tolerance, it’s for people who have a lot of money and already won the game. They just want to have less volatile, slower growth over time and don’t give a shit about hitting grand slams with Tesla weekly FDs.

They are addicted, I was just being cynical.

Sugar was an extremely rare and valuable resource for humans for hundreds of thousands of years. We crave it because in many of the environments we lived in, it could mean surviving through a famine.

Now instead of spending days poking at a bee hive and getting the shit stung out of us until they abandon it, we buy it in 10lb sacks and swallow it by the spoonful whenever we please. Anything you physically crave can become an addiction.

Facts
Yeah, I’m with you. A couple weeks ago, puts were making bank, but premiums are so high now, the risk/reward is off. That massive pump end of day Friday blew out a lot of puts. Call credit spreads seem like the way to go right now. You can get a 20% return for example on the Wednesday SPY 340/339. Pretty good for 3 days and a good way OTM in a downward trending market.

They were just the first solid non-hype name I thought of that had been thrown around, I don't specifically think they'll be the target.  Some sort of name-brand store with physical locations, decent revenue, and no hype was the general idea I was trying to convey.
Imagine USA is going into civil war and being able to be the big brother of NATO. Putin and his friends use the momentum and invade Europe east to west. Our army is pretty much shit here in Germany but some people believe in this as a possible future now. I will still buy any dip and cry about my calls fucking me every day atm

News flash: ISIS is not a country.  So taking away whatever land they never officially held won't automatically disband them.

The main reason mainstream media would ignore this is because they don't want Trump looking good.  It's why the media focused only on Iraq War deaths to make Bush's war look bad, while they focused only on ISIS to make Obama's war look good.

That and the whole corona epidemic and all the chaos it's causing taking priority in news coverage pretty much buried ISIS.  Even now, there's islamic terrorism still happening in Europe.  You just don't hear about them anymore.

Market jumped +15% in 1933 ... also the market jumped 11% on the back of Trump just saying “we are gonna have this thing taken care of by Easter” and stimulus...

I looked at shorting vol on Friday but don’t know a lot about vol as an asset class. Puts on VIX are crazy expensive. There are a few short vol ETFs that will probably do okay, but they have beta slippage. You could consider buying long vol and selling short vol. for example, IV on longer dated spy puts is around 27 right now while weeklies are over 40. I ended up staying with my current strategy, which is to be a net seller of premium using credit spreads and iron condors. These have done well lately, and made up for a few trading fuck ups.

I don’t doubt that Snap is overvalued at the moment, but I sense a misunderstanding in how popular snap is and will become with younger generations. Not including Snaps constant ability to monetize everything they get involved in. They are the go to messaging platform. I bet the time being spent on it by users is higher than any other app. Now by having to be on it in order to communicate with people, you’re more susceptible to ads. Liked the stock at 28, not at 40. However, they are going places.

Dear diary, 

it is now sunday november first. I am seeing a lot of gay bears talking about the collapse of the economy and their puts printing. I feel bad that tomorrow, they will experience what I experienced in april and may.

Ask yourself, if a random person bought 100 hotdogs and was asked to eat all 100 hotdogs in one sitting, would you argue there's a 50/50 chance he would succeed? The odds of a random person eating 100 hotdogs in one sitting is unlikely, not impossible but very unlikely.

Fair, but also they have to make this work or it's tons of lost Capital. 

Anecdotal but they had Universal Studios with dry ice and huge scary props, actors in zombie makeup. Also they had a huge projector in the massive parking lot for movies with lots of cars there. There's something here.

Listen buddy retard. I’m vegan so I’m somewhat well versed with that conflicting view you’re proposing. 100% I agree with what you said. That was obviously my first thought reading literally was “damn this is fucked up but also weird because Costco is admitting this is wrong but has an everlasting supply of different dead animals and their by products”. What you need to understand ben franklin is 1. Gradual/small change > no change/no acknowledgement 2. telling Costco, yo monkeys are being used as workers stop that, is going to be ALOT easier then presenting them with the great philosophical moral and ethical dilemma of using animals as food. Meat is so ingrained literally stitched into our every day, every holiday culture, you simply just cannot convince a huge wholesale company (arguably the largest) to stop selling their main “goods”. This whole dialogue is also more complex and has many routes but that’s the gist of it. Trust me dude PETA isn’t the one with the burden here. They literally 24/7 advocate against animal cruelty. Costco is just hypocritical and will make exceptions. Just like I used to be. And just like most of the world

Im thinking about UVXY calls or selling a cash secured put. IV is through the roof right now, and with the uncertainty of the election and covid cases rising, i think it will perform wel.
Here's my thesis why buls r fuk:

We're in a bubble. Stimulus is just an excuse, low interest rates are just an excuse, money printer go brrr is an excuse and QE doesn't actually print money directly (only when banks go lend, which they're not doing because who the fuck would lend money now jfc).

Deep down in the most bullish bull's heart lies this grain of truth. Their subconscious knows that this market makes no sense. Every excuse that existed so far has been invalidated. Corona is here, stimulus is not, elections will be a shitshow. When the market reacts every time Pelosi and Mnuchin take a shit you know there's no smart money left there.

So we drill. Maybe not on Monday open, maybe not on election night. But soon we drill straight to 1929 Dow, mark my words

Snap has almost double the market cap of Twitter. Meanwhile it seems like it is harder to monetize snap as Snapchat is used primarily for messaging between other people while Twitter is used as a more traditional social media platform, makes more revenue, is easier to get your tweet in front of a larger audience(advertising), has more users, has a slightly older user base, meanwhile Snapchat is turning into what most people would argue is kik 2.0.

Accurateish, but not really relevant. We All know the election comes down to about 6 states. So a nationwide poll and gap that large isn't really telling anyone much. 

I live in Wyoming. No one gives a shit. 

Polls in states that matter (AZ, MI, PA, NC, FL, WI) are tighter than 10, and not quite safely outside margin of polling error

Polls are heavily biased towards dems (most commissioned by dems, and the political affiliation of the pollster has the largest effect on the outcome of the survey).

I'd expect it to be veeeeery close in reality, though maybe still in Biden's favor.
Bear just be patience! Huge opportunity ahead!!

Depends .. buying to trade or invest. 

If you want to hold long term .. wait for a dip to buy it will probably go back under 30 but rally again in a month or so. 

If you are looking to trade - sure the volatility is bonkers you can usually catch a good .70 - 1.00 price swing intraday. It turns quick though .. can easily miss an exit and end up bag holding or taking an L

Analysts said price target is $40, but anal-Ists also say that as a head fake so they can exit their positions and leave you bag holding.

Proportion for US (230,000/328,000,000) = 0.000701219512195

Proportion for Sweden (6,000/10,000,000) = 0.0006

.0007 in US vs. .0006 in Sweden. 

So the US has a higher proportion of deaths. Very slightly.


**For context here, we are not doing good**. 

**Both Sweden and the US are doing shit compared to other countries**

Italy (Deaths/Population): 0.000639794565938

France: 0.000549156590536

I provided the data that shows 2-3 people dying in Sweden per day even when it has been open for all practical purposes.

There are international flights running from/to Sweden without covid testing requirement for months. That's something which we don't have the luxury of having in US.

But on the other hand in US, where half my city looks dead on a Saturday evening because no one is going out on a holiday, 800+ are dying everyday.

No, these are good questions - don't apologize for asking questions like these. If you don't work in a field like this, how could you be expected to understand this kind of shit? It was incomprehensible to me many years ago before I entered the field professionally.

Funny enough, even scientists aren't completely sure about what most of these mutations really mean yet. However, I can say that the D614G mutation in the viral "spike" protein (the protein on the virus surface that binds a different protein on the surfaces or our cells making the virus stick to our cells and get taken inside to infect) has been shown to have a number of effects.

I tend to think less at the epidemiological level and more at the mechanistic biochemical level. At that level, it appears that the D614G virus is more stable in a certain sense and it replicates better in cell culture consequently. This can make it both more lethal (higher virus load in a person more quickly) and more contagious. If you look at the first source I cited in rebuttal to the OD (original dumbass), they did in fact find enhanced lethality. 

However, I will note that this is not entirely settled. Virus-host interactions in the context of genetics and individual biochemistry, human behavior, ... It's extremely complex. There are so many parameters involved in patient outcomes.
Since EU will probably open red following UK lockdown, we might open slightly red/flat & go test friday's lows or 321 then bounce.. real action will be on Wed/Thu/Fri. MM's already know what they wanna do we just have to follow..

Do the math you moron. I did it for you above. Luckily, you won't be here long as you are an actual idiot.

Take total deaths/ total cases. Not hard.
I take offense to that, I take the asymmetrical risk into consideration thank you very much.
Dont know if you have the ability to do this, but a bet on low volatility would be a short strangle. You would write an out of the money call and put on a stock or stocks. You keep the premium, but it's risky (in any market, let alone this one) and I'll put my money on you being wrong about volatility. The safe bet is writing a covered call on a stable stock. Maybe GE?

You should check out total deaths per year compared to normal years. Even without adjusting for less Americans on the road it looks like a very bad year on the mortality tables

more deaths in USA (in proportion to population) and still increasing
This is certainly a good point.

But, I do like to respond so that at least other readers can be given the opportunity to see some real information. Sure, the dumbasses are beyond help, but there are others who are less set in their minds and deserve the truth.
They cracked the code
Don’t buy an option just because it’s all you can afford
1. They are healthier
2. When they do get sick it is often through diminished viral load bc they wear masks and soc distance 
3. Good healthcare 
4. All Swedes have health care and dont hesitate to go to the hospital. “Fear of deportation” and “fear of financial hardship” from hospitals visits keep the brown brothers from going until shit gets bad.
Retard
terrible, no way it ends up ITM
This is the way.
Cases in Sweden started exploding in the beginning of October (they literally more than doubled as compared to September).

But deaths have been 2-3 per day since. Even accounting for the population differences, the death rate in US is a big multiple of deaths in Sweden. Sweden is not locked down just like most states in US (except maybe the proportion of masked people in those states vs Sweden)
Honest question though, I have read that the last mutation is far more infectious but less fatal and more genetically stable (no idea what it means, maybe I misread something).

Is this consistent with what you know and is this a typical phase in virus life or what? 

Sorry if these questions are retarded, I am just genuinely curious.

Snap has almost double the market cap of Twitter. Meanwhile it seems like it is harder to monetize snap as Snapchat is used primarily for messaging between other people while Twitter is used as a more traditional social media platform, makes more revenue, is easier to get your tweet in front of a larger audience(advertising), has more users, has a slightly older user base, meanwhile Snapchat is turning into what most people would argue is kik 2.0.

This is exactly what people and the media aren't talking about. The reason Americans are dying at a higher rate (or seem to be), is because of their fucking diet. If you sit around eating shit fast food all the time and travelling by segway you're more prone to this virus; that's a fact.

It is not disinformation at all. Why would hospitals test dead patients for COVID-19? Maybe because they make more money from Medicare and Medicaid if the patient “had COVID-19,” even though it wasn’t the reason they died. Source: Actual medical professions working in hospitals, in multiple states and a person of some damn intelligence that doesn’t listen to doomsday reports from CNN, FOX, et cetera.

As a biochemist, you’re trying to tell me that the virus has not mutated (six independent strains reported this summer)? Each mutation has become less and less deadly. There’s a reason that the death toll dropped DRASTICALLY from Italy and France to the USA. We didn’t have fewer people die because of our far superior healthcare system. It is because the virus mutated for its own survival and thus became less deadly! If the virus hasn’t mutated, why aren’t we seeing higher deaths here? If we had the same deadly strain that Italy had, we would be seeing 50K+ dying for every 500K infected. I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. It isn’t ANYWHERE near as deadly now.
Ah ok. I guess thats fair
It has mutated to kill you more effectively

IMO, this is likely to be election-driven, since logically nobody wants to buy before election when they don’t know what to buy *yet*. 



We can only call this a covid crash if we are crashing after election is sorted out.
Fucking true. When is he booked in to go?

I’ve been looking at large spikes in price due to news and then evaluating how much staying power it could have. For instance I saw Netflix jump on news that they increased prices. This is problematic because Netflix’s biggest issue right now is getting and keeping customers and increasing the price during a global economic crisis didn’t make sense. Therefore, I bought Netflix puts at a strike price a little below the closing price for the day before the spike.
The wizard has spoken. calls one month out are the way
Ditto.  Sold at the last peak.  Feels like nothing good is coming for a while.  No vaccine or atim pump.  DIX and GEX super low.  VIX rising.  Spy could be near 300 next week.

I was not talking about the indicator really, just the comment that picking a coin flip 20 times in a row is pretty hard, really hard. Then to go on and say someone picked roulette 32 times in a row like its common when you have better chances of winning the lottery.

I recently got over an ex. Once I realized, I felt like a worthless option expired worthless. No longer holding the bag. Make time for yourself. Go to the gym or exercise at home, not for girls, but for you. It might take time to get over her, but you live and learn, and one day you'll meet another better person.
The PE ratio is a simple way to assess whether a stock is over or under valued and is the most widely used valuation measure. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings PE ratio as of October 21, 2020 is 6.38.

Agree. Money will go pouring back into stocks as soon as election turmoil is over.
How do y’all decide what tickers to target for 0dte when there’s going to be an obvious selloff? I picked Google Friday & made money but got greedy & subsequently lost more when I tried again. Such a hard for picking the only strong stock of day

They're basically getting a 15% return on their equity, while but paying anything on basis.

If the Gov't is going to restrict supply, they shouldn't allow price increases. There should be an appraisal when you enroll and it's indexed to inflation

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again.

Guys hear me out...what if because everybody expects the election to be a complete shitshow, and once it’s over the market is big green cause of all the money on the sidelines waiting to get back in and they realize the world isn’t really on the verge of civil war like everyone thinks every election year. Just look at the fact that this week travel stocks got fucked like tech stocks. That’s not because of corona. Apple and amazon after good earnings report got fucked, same for Microsoft. People are limiting exposure to the market as a whole and just waiting to get back in the stock and don’t want to get fucked by the election and corona news, but decided now wasn’t the time. When it is the time, the trend will reverse hard. Apple was down 6% after a good earnings report and amazon was 5.5%.
Dude we’ve seen this song and dance a thousand times.  The time to get out was two weeks ago and some people didn’t get off the ride.  So now you are looking for some retail bag holders for a quick pre-earnings pump so you can dump your shares.

Actually the latest thinking around VCs and Silicon Valley is a anti IPO. Just look at snowflake for proof of type of money left on table and few select that get privilege and access etc. Bill gurley has great wrote up on it. Direct listings and spacs with a decent sponsor is way to go especially in current market landscape. Only issue is do they want ackman as a minority holder or not. That needs ironing out. But if you look at his tontine board members. Ovitz and Jackie and the like it does seem like he’s definitely pushing the envelope towards the right type of unicorn and not just what he’s been know for in the past - food outlets etc. So stripe is not unreasonable to imagine as a target especially as he admitted taking to them and Airbnb. Now it’s just down to price and ironing out details. He’s got 4 bn from spac another 3 bn from his hedge fund and looking for minority stake. There are very few large scale unicorns out there. Whatever it is if his spac is snake oil then I dunno where you’d consider ‘safe’ to invest in these markets.

Part of the reason there is a bubble is that YouTubers found cards as a way to create content.

So a part of the bubble is YouTube monetization.

When dumb youtubers try to find these cards, they are all bidding for the same low inventory. But when they stop making these dumb videos, what do you think happens to the prices?

It'll be just like what happened to pogs.

I'm honestly surprised PETA hasn't ventured further to protect the emotions of the trees that prematurely lost their fruits and are now advocating Jonestown style mass hunger strikes.  But don't eat cyanide, it damages the planetary emotions of the land it was dug from.

Agreed on the rodeo. We're in for a wild week.

I think we might be "too low" last week was all down. It would make sense for a short term pump then another drop imo

Conspiracy theory: A hedge fund will take a short position on SNAP, give a high-profile "influencer" or two a large sum of money to say Snapchat is a lame platform, then sell their position. 

SNAP closed at 28.45 on 10/20, and closed at 42.86 on 10/28. It just isn't the kind of stock that is going to hold on to gains like that. I'm looking for $35 by the end of next week.
I believe there is some. More likely to lose if market is not prospering. But overall I think you're right, correlation is not necessarily causation.

That run is tired.
They didn't want to pass stimulus because the rich told them not to.

There's a reason why they keep flip-flopping their bullshit narrative about "avoiding deflation" and then "avoiding inflation".  It was never about inflation.  It's about keeping the masses down.

And they'll be just fine no matter how bad things get because they can afford all the security they'd ever need.
why? as long as the bank gets the loan amount back then the program is a success
really? anyone bullish is dumb right now
Not a bad idea on TWTR, although they are already way down on their ATH due to earnings. Wondering if there are better plays for a Trump win (alternatively, hedges for a Biden win).

Who got bull trapped Friday into close? That was like the textbook definition of one.
Puts or calls for Wayfair earnings? 🤔🤔
That's not the point. The point is that lowering interest rates much more doesn't stimulate loan growth and isn't stimulative because anyone who wanted more debt already would have done so. No one who wanted/needed credit was was sleeping on 3.75% the last 6 months.  

People who need access to credit who don't have it yet likely wouldn't have it at 2% either since they'd be turned down. The people who do jump at the 2% rate would be people who already could have paid 3.75% no problem, thus all you do is increase the risk for lenders and lower interest expense for those stable borrowers. The people who couldn't get a loan at 3.75% still won't qualify at 2%.

Do you want Apple to borrow for even less while Joe Small Business still can't get credit?

I’m sensing a heavy rotation back into value stocks soon.
Or believe the guy who believes there’s now a 2 hour time difference between East and West coasts.
What are good ways to make plays on Monday for each potential outcome depending on one's personal election thesis?

1) Close, goes to courts: VIX calls?

2) Biden: Green energy calls? ICLN?

3) Trump: SPY calls? Will there be IV crush like a SPY earnings report?

4) Clear winner, either way: SPY calls also?


For #2, the play seems like a very easy no brainer and would also make a really great hedge for betting #3. However I am not sure if #3 is such a good play because it's not such an obvious correlation.

Looking for better ideas!

If Trump does that, the Democratic party will win 100% of the election. You cannot have a 3rd party in the current voting system. If Trump loses, he will start campaigning for 2024 right away, that's my guess.

The model is just all around incorrect. Small tweaks of the values can make it run between 40,000 up to millions. The code is just horrible. Running the same scenario multiple times with the same parameters can come out with differences of 80,000 or more. The college has not endorsed a new number since. 

Pretty decent article about it: https://www.heritage.org/public-health/commentary/failures-influential-covid-19-model-used-justify-lockdowns

The professor that led the team has since resigned from his advisory role from the government. The official reason is because he let his girlfriend come over to his house during a stay at home order. 

If you want to read the code, a heavily modified version is on GitHub: https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model

They had an older version of it up that had some really suspicious commits in it, but they force pushed this newer version over it.

And ahh, that makes sense. You used 1%. The current best estimate is an IFR of at most one half percent only for people over 70 years old. 

I think that's an overall IFR of about 0.25%. We would have to do the math to get the exact number. It's interesting that the CDCs table doesn't have the overall IFR anymore. It used to. But, you can see the estimates here:

I once starved two days straight, drinking only coffee, and burned thru a hard hitters vape... Other times I used to chain smoke hash infused pre-rolls. Each had something like 30% THC in a 1 gram joint. Used to burn 5-6 such joints a day.

I count the as extreme. Obviously not world record or anything, but for me and most people it's pretty extreme.

I heard someone call this the "bubble bubble" lmao
Any reason in particular?
Interesting, didn't know that. Although I feel the drop off won't be nearly as severe for lockdown part 2.

Yeah, making a kids game on roblox and getting a popular YouTube to play it can = a shit ton of money - look at adopt me (roblox kids game with a constant >500k players, gone as high as 1.5 million players before)
Honestly wouldn’t be surprised if Adopt Me has made 50m+ but I have no clue

No you're right, I skimmed a forum too quickly, they just get published on roblox. The creators can still make considerable money though. Their wikipedia page claims there have been multiple games in roblox with revenues exceeding $10 million.

They can be, you can just keep selling calls as it falls and you will reduce the losses to some degree, the reason you do that is if you want to hold the stock and aren't sure how long a sell off will continue, for example stock drop x percent and you sell at the bottom and miss the rebound then when your calls get assigned you wheel, but if you are a better trader than you would just sell and rebuy lower

Yeah I mean deep down they know that you can only prop up this heaping pile of shit for so long. These boom/bust economic cycles appear to be inevitable, at least with the current setup. Who really wants to take responsibility for pulling the rug out though?

They've figured that people can just be "forced" to buy equities. The buying is getting tired though and the risk only becomes greater as this trash gets more overvalued. Maybe a sector rotation and switch to value can save it, idk. It just seems like the market is getting desperate and running out of places to put money. People literally trampled over each other to hop into SNAP and PINS. Looks like they thought TWTR would be the same deal but they got btfo.
factsss monday crashgg
Big red Monday, more red on election night. Then once there’s election stability and stimulus hits then it will be one last final leg up to euphoria for the next few months before a crash.

Is that a Biden win pick?
Dude we started a fucking trade war that led to disastrous results for the ungrateful fucks. Fucking automated shit does most of what labor there was for those assholes anyway.

Yep, if Biden wins I suspect a few deaths which will freak people out. On top of that Trump ain’t gone till January which gives him lots of time to piss on all the furniture before he goes. I don’t think being cash gang for awhile is crazy. Hold on to your hats.

Better for farmers. Worse for everyone else

It's the season finale of 2020 boys. Buckle up
First day of no fap November. I haven't slept yet it, hasn't let me but i know if i just get a quick tug out with a little help from some Latina riding  a dick 3x the size of mine with a tiny schoolgirl skirt still on it would put me to bed so fucking quick. Here we are 6am fighting demons.

So it's light earlier and dark earlier? Why is that ever a good thing?
Thing is that we are only looking at this indicator afterwards. If someone made the prediction before those twenty elections, it would be impressive. But just finding one indicator out of many possible ones after the fact is not that hard.

Btw, there is always something that happens a [first time in this year's election](https://xkcd.com/1122/), maybe this is the first one where the indicator was strong.
Keep going I’m cumming
Or uvxy. Let’s face it. Better chance markets drill more than moon. These are decent “safe”plays.
Looking at UVXY. Debating between a long call option (12/11) and selling if we get a spike at any point in the next month or buying an equivalent dollar amount in shares and setting a stop loss. Any idea what I would set the trail percentage to? March had some crazy swings.

Bonus points is that even when you missed the first drill start (EU market opens) and buy it at open, you can still have gains because when US is also red, thats a double drop. Exactly what happened on Friday.
It works by the EU time, meaning it opens together with EU rather than US. US comes later.
Tomorrow?

Alternative to that would be buying -1x Amazon, Apple, Nvidia or similar ETFs, that way, when shit does go down, you can still make money. Its not massive gains, 2-4% per drill session, but its better than nothing lol.

Puts too pricy. Sdow is the play all week like last week. It’s an easy 5-10 percent play this week. Doesn’t get all you idiots hard, but this is the way. Nice hedge and against long positions 

Sqqq.... maybe as well.
I checked out the website and it gave my eyes aids.

You guys are so smart, but first you have to prove herd immunity exist. Latest studies show around 3 months of raised immunity. 

Overblown? 230k deaths with around 600 to qk mote every day. We could easily have 300k deaths by the end of the year. I believe that makes it the 2nd highest cause of death this year.
Seriously this. I am fucked also.

Yeah, but the Obama reelection wasn't during this shitstorm, at least the storm of feces was smaller. I guess both options are equally bad.

I dont think Adderall does what you think it does if you believe this.
Well really I should say that we are going to test the upper bound of the current profile range, likely fail and revert to the mean. Only problem is volatility is causing reversion to the mean to be testing the other bound. This time testing the lower bound will likely trigger a larger sell off due to being in a OTF down on the weekly/daily.

sure, there could be a rally at open on Monday.. but it's going to just selloff to more lows. So I would sell into the rally what you're holding. I've been selling into rallys the last 2 trading days.

I think you're completely wrong on selling took prices too far.. You're going to see 3050-3000 range this week. Do with that what you will. I'm looking for 2725 in coming weeks.

They still did a lot worst than others countries. I do agree with you that they probably didn't have 1/5 of the cases because countries like Russia, Brazil, China, India were most likely lying about their results and a lot of third world countries dont havs testing. But the US are doing worst than the rest of the western countries. The testing numbers in the us are high because a lot of peoples have symptoms and get tested.
Every damn weekend there's some retard thinking Weekend Dow matters

Thanks for that link. Learned a lot. But here are a few points. The Initial impact of covid in the US was limited to very few states (ny, nj, ca, etc). Due to the measures these states took, they significantly slowed the spread to other states. However, while they were dealing with it initially, they experienced a lot of deaths. If you get excess deaths, predominantly occurring in only those few states, and divide by the total number of historic deaths (occurring in the entire US), it makes sense that the excess mortality % is very low. As you have said, US has a large population. The second peak in excess mortality in the US (around august I believe) may have been the second wave that occurred in the mid west. This second peak in excess mortality doesn’t exist anywhere else except in the US. Unfortunately, this third time, many many states are seeing surges all at once so unless something chances, excess mortality is expected to spike. Nothing like what European countries have seen. 

You say that covid death #s are higher in the US due to higher testing compared to European countries. Implying that those who would’ve died from other causes, were recorded as dying from covid simply because they tested positive for it. If it wasn’t the symptoms of covid they were suffering from before they died, why were they even tested? Was there a nation-wide hospital protocol that mandated everyone (regardless of symptoms) to be tested for covid? As far as I know, Europe isn’t at a shortage of testing: people who want one get one. I find it hard to believe that it is the undetected covid cases that is causing lower death #s in Europe. I get that determining the cause of death is tricky, and that each country/hospitals have their own standards. But the numbers are too extreme to solely attribute to that fact. 

I stopped following covid as carefully as soon as it died down in my state, but there’s really no good reason to believe that US is handing this well by 1st world country standards
Hard to have school shootings when no one is going to school. If my theory about the election is correct we are going to have plenty of dipstick militia types doing dip stick militia type shit. I hope I am wrong but heck it is 2020.

So without going into detail as to why which I can, I see two plausible scenarios both leading to a bounce/green candle on Monday... a possible gap down to test $320 and then a rally afterwards, or a flat/gap up open and rally to about the $332-$333 level where I see some resistance on the daily timeframe. It seems that there was strong support at the $322 level on Friday (really thought we'd see $320) and the eod rally created a big enough bottom wick on Friday’s daily candle suggesting that a flat/gap up open is a bit more likely. There’s other technical reasons as to why I feel that a bounce/rally is more likely on Monday/Tuesday versus a continued selloff. It seems last weeks selling took prices too far out of its trading channel, so I see it recapturing prices into the channel before further drops...

When you approach expiration or value greatly increases, you can sell your winning contracts to lock in profits and roll up (buy more at higher strike for lower cost) or out (buy more with longer expiration) or both. I was able to do this several times with TSLA last year.

Okay motherfuckers Fuck your TA this is big boy time coming up. I advise all bitch ass traders to leave the market alone right now. For all you real ones, hardcore wave surfers this is the moves:

It goes down day eod buy calls because if it was  -4 ,-5%+ shit bounces back hard next day , ignore all logic from the real world things wont be all back to normal in a day but shit just bounces thats how it goes. Sell those calls next day before noon because the next days we going back down so stock up on all those puts that got cheaper over night. Next day sell em get em off your hands. Depending the size of the fall it could mean bounce the next day so get calls any fucking way especially if dumb shit happens and NIO goes to 1.50 or some other company people think "will be the end of...." BUY CALLS ON RED DAYS PUTS EOD ON GREEN

That's your opinion, and here's mine-
I think a few things are likely to happen:
1) Trump wins, we get riots in the streets
2) Biden wins, we get sell off (increase in Cap Gains) for all those sweet tendies everyones been holding since 2016. 
3) No one wins right away, and we go to the supreme court for a decision, more riots, more unrest.

Get a few tennis balls to have around in case your back goes out. Stick it in a door frame, use it to undo muscle knots, etc. Tie two of them in a sock and you have DIY chiropractor thingy.

Have seen a lot of retarded ETFs. But here comes the best - launched last week I think

["American Conservative Values ETF"](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ridgeline-research-launches-acvf-the-american-conservative-values-etf-focused-on-large-capitalization-us-equities-301163818.html)

ACVF is the first-ever ETF that will attempt to align investments with the beliefs and values of politically conservative investors. We "Boycott" companies that do not align with conservative values, bringing together a community of conservative investors.

I’ve heard about this repub/dem thing a lot and it would be ideologically convenient for me. But I wonder if the exact start-end dates matter?

If the market goes down after tax increasing dems win election, does that drop off get put on republicans? In other words, does the start-end happen on election, New Years or inauguration?

I made sure of that no doubt. I will have a chance at redemption
Someone damaged the US economy that linked to the EU. Not in Asia, some part of Asia is doing good. Also, the Market was not even fully crashed yet in March. Because the FRB delayed the damage caused by someone until now, the first step you gotta do is compare the chart between Democrats years until 2017 vs Republican years until 2021 because 1-year affection on policy, for a Republican president, you should mainly play puts unless Powell invests money in the US in some emergency cases. For Democrats president, you should mainly play calls during his period. The FRB has enough money to cover the US depression and Powell will release the money regardless of whoever becomes the president and the FRB collects all money back later because there always be the deals between Powell and the US government to cover the economic fails. like, unleash the FRB to fund an unlimited amount of cash to banks and collect all that interest. This is how one man mistake destroys billions of people.

I'm not even saying you're wrong in the long run or that this means you're wrong...buuut.. to an extent it isn't so much that WSB is bearish now. Activity has plummeted. 

I bet if you could still see Robinhood activity that it's plummeted. The market has squeezed out a lot of people at this point. These threads have probably halved activity in the past three weeks or so.

Where's that stupid graph that people spam about bubbles that have points on it like investor euphoria, capitulation, etc? We're somewhere in the capitulation area if you want to simplify everything.

Troll is such an ugly word. I prefer charitable clown.
Well, first you'd have to be retarded enough to think that actual confirmed/tested cases/deaths are being done at the same rate in every country. When the U.S. completely dwarfs any other country with anything close to a comparable population, we're going to see more confirmed cases/deaths not because we have more, but because comparable countries/populations lack similar testing.

When you look at excess deaths by country, you can see that the U.S. did pretty well holding down the initial curve compared to several other countries and is not dramatically out of line in terms of overall excess death percentages.

Again, you'd have to be a true retard to think the U.S. ACTUALLY had 1/5 of the world's covid deaths vs 1/5 of the world's confirmed tested deaths due to superior testing numbers.

The answer is oil is fucked either way in the near future.
My conviction on a stock market melt-up in the fourth quarter is as high as can be. The market is poised for a swift & steep move in coming days & weeks. S&P to 4500, Nasdaq to 15,000 & DJIA to 36,000. One for the history books.

The volatility index has risen from 25 to 40 in October. In the next two or three months I wouldn't be surprised to see it fall from 40 to 15 as the market melt-up sets in. Might even see 10.
Hsi point is if the market is 100% going to drop in thr near future then it would have already dropped because everyone would sell in anticipation. This could easily be the opposite of buy the hype sell the news.

Interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.
I'd say most likely explanation is that we've gotten the ventilators out there that were so desperately needed at the beginning of the pandemic and in general have a better idea how to keep you alive if you get sick.

I’m still not seeing a significant spike in deaths from this October 2/3rd wave. Most likely explanation is that way more people had it in March/April and this spike in cases is just more people being tested due to higher availability of tests.

Yes a lot of people have it, but a lot had it back in the spring.

Fuck this Ernest Hemingway wanna be mother fucker
The problem is that *literally everyone* is thinking that way; and therefore options prices now reflect that concern, and the big boys have already trimmed their risk. 

Therefore, in the event of "chaos not bad as expected," the counterintuitive market reaction will be to *rally* at the moment everyone is expecting a crash.
It’s a risk.

But it’s like, since the drop first started a few weeks ago IV constantly thought “ok this HAS to be the bottom.”

I am a 47 year veteran of Wall Street. My first 26 years were spent on the buy-side as an institutional money manager. I have spent the last 21 years as a sell-side strategist. I am a life long contrarian who finds it easy to take positions quite apart from the crowd. I am most comfortable with my forecasts when my macro and technical analysis are in sync and when my views are at odds with the consensus. I've always been fascinated by the behavioral aspects of investing. Years of observing investor behavior has led me to the conclusion that investor psychology may be the most powerful emotional force in the universe, more powerful than love or hate. It causes otherwise rational beings to make some very irrational decisions. I think every investor should read Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles MacKay. I have to say, interesting to come here & see all of the bearishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest rally in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-up that will take the S&P to 4500, the Nasdaq to 15,000 & the DJIA to 36,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can rise to $50-$55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to $10 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck.

I can't buy a month out in SPY right now so I'll buy day off 5 minutes give or take after mkt open so IV can chill then I'll buy my calls or puts and then sell 20 mins before mkt close. No IV crush for me unless something gets crazy. It's expensive but works

Tech actually is one of the safer gambles if you want to focus on a particular industry.. Tech has been growing significantly over the last 10 years and is going to continue to do so. Everyone's saying the "tech bubble is popping"... well everyone's working from home... tech purchases in all types and from all demographics is up... cloud based services are going to grow massively as offices decide to leave buildings permanently closed.. We're about to see a long lasting culture shift in offices. Too many companies have realized we can save a ton of fucking money by having people work from home, so let's do that.

AMZN i feel like has already hit its prime. There's only so much you can take over before you start running into anti-trust problems, legal issues, and gov't policies start to fuck up your bottom line. AMZN is going to get slaughtered if Biden has his way with taxes and he probably will. AMZN LEAP PUTS for sure. 

GOOGL .. same boat

SNAP is just a retard bet. Same for SHOP. 

TLSA isn't going anywhere. If you want to see a major growth industry over the next 2 decades... electric vehicles, battery tech, wind and solar power, companies that are pioneering the future.

I have this stupid idea,

we do a wsb sourced fund that invests in fd yolos (buy in 10$ max/person) and a daily total investment of 1000$ per position. if multiple people join and the fund grows we can push for multiple positions. I'll invest personally in every yolo (10$ obviously) we exit the position 5 mins before the market closes. We pick if it's a call or put randomly ( Mabe we can sentiment analyze the day before daily thread and inverse skew it ) and buy the first fd that's trading at 10c 10mins before close the previous day.
What would be a scenario where stocks would rally after Tuesday’s results? I can’t think of any.

I don’t think that is a smart bet. Markets cope with certainty and hate uncertainty; after the election, a lot of uncertainty will go away one way or another, so I’d expect markets to rise whatever the result. Maybe there will be some drop in the meantime which is probably what the bearish gambler is hoping for.
[deleted]
This was posted already, it does look like a hedge. Nothing to see here move along.
Mango isn't better for the market. Bidens a better corporate choice and more likely to stop fucking with trade agreements or shutting down the government.

If you think a winner will be firmly decided on Tuesday, you haven't been paying attention.   Trump is not going to accept the results.  He's been preparing us for all the "fraudulent" mail-in ballots for months.  He's going to contest the results and it's gona be a shit show. buy puts

I bought shares (certainly not as many as you but still a decent chunk). May get more with this recent pull back but need to sell out of some other positions. Hope they can get Stripe but even if they announce some decent target, I'm sure we'll see a run up. The stock moved well with the Bloomberg rumors so could get 10%+ upside even for a target that I may not like.
or just get puts because why on earth would things go up in a contested election

Entirely TA, Zoom closed under support and in its price channel. I expect it to run to the bottom at 390ish with a good chance of breaking that channel to fill a gap at 330ish. I'm also okay with losing a couple of grand if I see a good probability for a 10 bagger.

LA to Michigan will be a difficult transition. You’re most likely going to hate it. But Michigan summers are hard to beat. Go exploring and find some cool spots when the weather permits. Don’t buy a nice car; the roads will eat it alive. Hopefully you’re somewhat close to Ann Arbor.

Spend as much time as you can on the lakeshores and the move will seem worth it for at least a few minutes.

People are going to talk about how awesome Autumn is. Don’t get your hopes up - it lasts like 2 weeks and then it’s just cold as fuck for like 6 months. Weather is extreme as shit there. You’re going to get wicked storms in the summer and random 2 feet of snow blizzards in April.

>Bills target will be solid, regardless of hype potential.

Yeah I think it will 100% be a name brand that people recognize, I don't think he'd pick something obscure. I'm just wary of the tech hype since I think there's a good possibility it will be a store, hotel, or restaurant chain not a tech play.  

People associate the word "unicorn" too much with silicon valley/venture capital and not with company valuation.  The way Ackman is using it is just shorthand for a mature billion dollar company.

Well, I personally already sold way way otm puts and calls so I have my Iron Condor, but the point for you is that this will absolutely not be a "normal election" 

Also the most important thing is the time, If you buy a straddle/strangle for a month or even 2 months, well, think about it, IV change or not, we will not be anywhere near where we are now in December my friend..
Interesting to come here & see all of the bullishness. I say interesting because I think we are just beginning what I expect to be the biggest, steepest drop in stock market history. We're beginning a parabolic melt-down that will take the S&P to 2,500, the Nasdaq to 5,000 & the DJIA to 15,000 in the 4th quarter. Metals also look strong with gold headed for $2300-$2500 & silver for $35. My targets for the miners remain unchanged with GDX to $55, GDXJ to $100, SIL to $75 & SILJ to $30. I think oil can fall to $-50 to $-55 in the 4th quarter before heading down to -$100 in next year's bust. Bond yields likely back up during the melt-up with 10yr to 1.20%-1.40% & 30yr to 1.80% to 1.90% before heading back down to new lows next year. 10y yield could fall to 0% in next year's bust. We are seeing history being made. Nothing about this period is normal. Stay safe and good luck

I'm liberal to the point my Elantra pulls to the left but the rhetoric I hear mostly from younger, more inexperienced first time voters seems to mimic the same hatred and vitriol they believe are invoked on themselves.

My point is that you might not have a chance.

Eh it's a silly arrangement because almost no one is actually going to redeem - at worst you'll sell it to someone else for *slightly* above nav and they'll hold it through the merger. 

That'll be especially true of this spac since the warrants attached make the intrinsic value nav + 2/9 warrants, so anyone redeeming is basically saying the stock is worth less than nav minus warrants. Usually even without warrants a spac price hovers slightly above nav at worst.

It's more for the benefit of Ackman since it prevents redemptions.

Im pro Biden, but the polls I don’t trust are - the supposed neck n neck race in TX, Florida, and North Carolina

If Biden sweeps the rust belt (which is a big if as I’m not even confident about Wisconsin) as well as home state Pennsylvania maybe even picks up Arizona as good measure then it’s a done deal

But many of these battleground states are either polling within the margin of error or accounting for “silent majority” 2016 error trailing rather than leading
And states like Georgia Texas and North Carolina may be slowly becoming more dem but I don’t see them fully flipping for at least another 4 years and with a much more charismatic candidate like we had w Obama

Technically, they're leveraged EFTs.
Most of them are spoiled kids who have no gratitude, and are in a perpetual state of victimhood. Some in their ranks are true believers, like the terrorist Susan Rosenberg. But most of the people who are truly responsible for encouraging and inflaming all of this remain in the shadows. It takes an incredible amount of funding and media resources to create something like this inorganically. 

The most egregious part is that those who are truly responsible always seem to escape justice. The people we’ve already lost like David Dorn are never coming back. Their families never get to speak with them again.

Antibody cocktails have shown to be very effective against COVID for sure. 

However, the question is whether there is enough production capacity around the world to meet the demand. Even if you count in all the major biologic manufacturing firms around the world, there is simply not enough capacity. We would be lucky if there is enough dose to treat 1M people by next Jan. 

In late stages, DXM is shown to be plenty effective, so we are covered there as well.

Please understand the difference between the national popular vote and the popular vote in a state.

The statement "Candidate X will lose the popular vote"  is generally understood to mean that they will lose the national popular vote, not the popular vote of some unspecified state.

Also, you understand that each ticket chooses their own electors right?  So one candidate has no control over who the electors are for a state that the other candidate wins.  So that is a problem for your crazy theory.

I think it will be a big name brand that's relatively boring to anyone who wants him to pick a tech hype target.  His last merger was [RBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) where he merged Burger King and Tim Hortons. 

So I would be very unsurprised if it was something solid like Menards - that's why I really don't like all the hype pushing - I think we're going to see a HCAC/Canoo situation where the price gets dumped back to nav on the target announcement if it isn't a hype beast name because of retail expectations for a flashy unicorn.

You saw what happened with the Bloomberg rumor last week, it actually hurt the price after the initial bump.
Next week will be the rise of the embedded journalist.
Did something new happen that I’m unaware of?

Imma give you some real advice unlike some tards here. Don’t buy anything before January. They have their battery day conference type thing on like the 9th or something. I don’t see their price going up till then. And their ER is like after December 4th. Buy January leaps. Good luck captain o7

Norwegian is essentially selling between $16-18. Though this past week it did go below that $16 mark for a few days which then I was a little worried. But for the most part I’m just playing that range with puts and I’d I get assigned then screw it just sell a call for the following Friday.

#You literally bought all stocks right before an election and preparing for a recession.. I mean.. How much more can I help you?

# I don't know how many shares you have, but for every 100 shares you have, you sell a call at a strike you think the stock will go to and let it take your shares away and get the heck out of the market.

#I would consider buying here:

- Dis - $110

- BA - $135

- AAPL - $103-ish

- Tesla - $375-ish or lower..

I don't really know the key levels of the others..
The market dipped 10% after the last contested election in 2000. This was pre: 9/11, wars, geopolitical tensions, covid, QE, record debt,  etc.  We probably will not find out the results of the election until possibly a week later and if this is a contested election I sure as hell don’t see a drop in volatility.  Further there are extremist on both sides of the political environment so I suspect protests/riots if either candidate wins.  Not promoting fear but is something to be concerned.  Good luck and Bless 🇺🇸

Ok , so now you're just exposing how retarded you are. Ohio is absolutely the Midwest. Even though it doesn't look like it on a map, fuckhead. Go read a book now and learn something.
Or hear me out retard. A sample size of just 10 elections. Your argument is horrible and your sample size is worse. If you used actual numbers to back it up that would be cool. You are using 40 years to cover your ass, but election only happen every 4 Incase you didn’t know that retard. Looking at early vote turn out in battle ground states trump is looking to be the winner because electoral is greater than popular.

When you’re buying an option you’re making a directional bet and risking money. You need to decide at what price in the opposite direction it would need to hit for you to be wrong and use that as a reference to determine what the stop loss on the option would be.
I think having standard definitions of employee vs contractor being defined specifically for transportation and food delivery companies is stupid, but doesn't mean I think it'll fail. Lots of stuff I don't agree with passes in CA. I'll probably sell in advance too. Over 50% would suffice. I only have 2 contracts

bloomberg ended up not being true?

>but he estimated only 50/150 in that size would fit his criteria.

Yeah because he's talking about whether it would meet ***all*** the criteria to actually merge. Basically 150 are in the price range but only about 50 would actually make the cut as they audit candidates looking for a mature company with covid resistant cash flow. 

Obviously some like AirBnB will know they aren't going to make the cut and just flat refuse to even open up their books.  Others like Stripe either did show him preliminary numbers and didn't make the cut, or are getting a gentler parting kiss because they didn't aggressively leak that they rejected Ackman's advances.
Why? I don't remember any face ripping rallies in The Big Short.

The world economy is interconnected and if one link is doing badly, the rest will follow suit. The market took a hit the day after Germany and France announced new lockdown measure until the end of November. Now that Britain is also announcing lockdowns, I believe the market will dip further. Of course, I'm slightly retarded and may be wrong, but at the same time there's no way the market will be unaffected by the lockdowns of other 1st world countries.

Here is my thoughts. Ackman might not get stripe, but Stripe has a lot of things working against it and time/capital is of the essence. You have ANT going public and they are already a massive player. Stripe is well received and they can raise capital quickly at a pre-determined valuation and hopefully accelerate their growth plans. You also have other behemoths that can eventually focus on what Stripe does... Square, paypal, adyen (Already a big competitor). Ackman might not get stripe, but the talks happened with Stripe because at one time he believed it was a possibility. The comment about Stripe not being mature enough.... a 36B dollar fintech company growing like crazy facing immense competition???? seems like the time is right to accelerate your plans.

Learned something useful tonight about risk management. 

Before you put on a position, ask yourself what price the underlying would have to hit for you to be wrong. That should be your stop loss. Then determine how much you want to risk on the trade. Your position size should be determined by the first 2.

I'm confused, you dropped 2%on shares in a day and this is too much?
VIX is up. Week🔚 Dow is totally useless when the moves are small. It’s pretty hard to ignore a 1% move though, but I still think those twats are too bearish
Yeah or a fixer upper that is also below market value. And then you juice it for what it’s worth. You make way more money than the stock market and there is less risk. However it requires knowledge, pretty good intellect and hard work as well as cash. That’s why no one does it.

I dont think it works that way cause the same party can place as many tickets in as they want. To run for president you need to apply for it. You can run for president if you'd like too. But the reason parties don't place more than one ticket is because that would split the vote. If the country votes 50/50 it would end up 50/25/25 so there's a clear winner. If rank choice voting is implemented we may one day see more than one ticket per party since their parties other ticket could be their second choice.

I don't even fucking do DD anymore it's all worthless horseshit.

You're right- he held limited discussions, meaning it was a potential target. The list of potential unicorns in his price range is probably 30 companies. I'll put an edit on here to clarify STRIPE is just one of the many types of companies that it could be.

Except for may when it didn't and everyone just forgot about that
Watching ep 9 now lol
Who needs onlyfans when you have GLD.
Lol when the market froze. I entered a put at the price. So let’s say it was a dollar. And my account had $10. So I placed a market order for 9 contracts at $1 while the market froze due to the sell off.  So once it opened it executed the order at what ever market price it was and now it was let’s say it’s now $6. So now it executed at let’s say $10 a contract. Now my account was $10. But I came in at $90. So I’m down $80. From the jump.    So if the contract come back down to $1 im at a loss. If it drops I’m fucked if it goes up I’m good.
looks like you were wrong unless those puts were weeklies or you already sold.

>Stripe is just a potential target, ***nothing is guaranteed***

Uh no shit, I would go as far as to say that Stripe is ***not*** a potential target: [*"Ackman said he held limited discussions as well with Stripe, which he said isn’t mature enough yet to go public."*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-03/ackman-says-he-held-early-talks-to-take-airbnb-stripe-public?sref=TBDibEcD)

I'm not sure why people keep trying to pump these silly hype targets like Stripe/AirBnB/Bloomberg that aren't going to be the merger target and are just going to lead to a bunch of disappointed retail investors dumping their shares when a real target is announced.
Get your lube ready.
I sold some puts on it, I'll have a small position soon enough unless it rockets. Spacs are my favorite risky investment. Going long on deac and vtiq have been my most profitable plays. If I had held vtiq 2 more fucking days the small 1500 investment of calls I had at that time that I sold for 4k would have been fucking 45k but whatever, I love spacs
Your link verifies that there's strong brand loyalty when it comes to their gpu's like i suggested. You and your circle of enthusiasts also just talked about all also buying the 3000 series RTX. Even if you hold off one month for Cyberpunk you'll still be buying it Q4. The strongest budget card remains the 1660 but who knows for how long.

Edit: I'm just saying its not as strong of a bet that I would take. AMD however did sell crap loads of the 2600 cpus.

Even when they get crushed they don’t lose 100% though. A bad play should only lose them 10-20%. A reallly bad play would lose them 50%. They always have an opportunity to come back though. I’d say most are down though for the most part. I still haven’t found a reason why buying and holding specific shares would underperform their methods.

Don’t worry, I bought ddog calls when they were $78 a share and sold at $113, $270qqq 11/20 p @$1.25, ddog puts when it was 112 $110p 11/20, RY puts (75 and 70 when it was $74.28) exp 11/20 and 1/23(75p). Needless to say I have been printing and closed my positions on Thursday excluding the 1/23 p and I’m still holding 2/3 of my qqq puts.

The fact that your position is down is not a big deal the whole market is bleeding. But this whole peddling of Stripe going public via a SPAC based on twitter followership is the kind of crap that gets people into all sorts of trouble. The only comment stripe has ever made is that they are not ready to go public...that's it.

That "dream" is dated and not particularly relevant in the current global economy. The US was the fastest growing economy with limited competition ages ago. You could be competitive in the US job market when everything is growing and you aren't competing with many people (women weren't really in the workforce so limited competition). Now, you have very capable men and women in the US competing (thus, need for differentiation with education, job skills, etc.), as well as with people from other countries that were considered "third world" back then (they are are also getting better educations and tend to have strong work ethics if they are the type who'd learn English and move across the world to the US). Technology has also eliminated or reduced the need for high school educated people in certain jobs.

That said, it's probably never been easier to learn and develop skills. Stupid example but I was trying to learn guitar and my instructor said when he was a kid he'd listen to records over and over to learn the notes. Then cassettes came out and it would be easier to rewind and replay parts. Then there were improvements in technology to slow down the song so it was easier to hear fast parts. Then VHS came out and he was able to watch educational videos from some of his favorite musicians. By the time I started, pretty much every song is tabbed out, there is tablature software that can visually play the songs for you at various tempos, many publishers put out sheet music for popular songs, there are a million videos online, there are guitars that light up and held you know what frets to play, etc. It's insane how much is out there to help you get better quicker. For many jobs, you can learn the relevant skills to get you in the door, get experience, keep learning on and off the job, move up to the next position, and keep grinding.
turns out im a lot more attractive than i give myself credit for

There’s plenty following out of here though.
Why the fuck would you hold anything over the weekends when a single occurrence like England entering lockdown again will send every europoor to their refurbished HP laptops to click the sell button. I learned that lesson in March.

Here are your options:
- Get 300K and go to China for hair cloning, yes it exists, see president of China for proof 
- Take finasteride and accept the risk of side effects along with Nizoral shampoo. This will stop the hairloss, but will probably not regrow unless you’re lucky
- Get FUE hair transplant and don’t do it for less than 20K, go to Beverlyhills or wherever the actors go, you’ll still need to take finasteride to stop further loss
- wait a few years if you can, more options coming

I wanted to use this money to yolo to try to become rich so I can retire earlier. I have more trust in Nio long term and can actually see them being a big deal in the EV market. Pltr I think will pop soon to $15-$20 and then I will sell.

I wonder if that's accurate - I mean obviously if he ***won*** before dying that's one thing, he is the elected president even if he hasn't been sworn in yet. 

But if he died before being elected I wonder if the Democrat party could technically pick whatever candidate they wanted to be their presidential pick, and all the votes for the Democrat candidate would be reassigned to that person. Because technically you're voting for the party and the party picks the candidate.

Obviously the least controversial route would be to make the VP the new presidential candidate even if they had the power to pick anyone, but it's an interesting "what if" - I'm just curious if they *could* chose whoever they wanted.
OP, if this is your girlfriend - marry her.

I completely agree with you.  We should have young healthy people with a low risk of death being exposed and build up herd immunity.  Those over 60 should be the one in lock down especially if they are retired.  Everything they need can be delivered to them.

Covid is being completely blown out of proportion for most of the population. Go check how many kids and teens have actually died from covid.  The number is like a 100 in TOTAL! This article is a little old but pretty directional. Most of those had underlying health issues.

The answer is, if someone opens a put contract they do not need to own shares of stock. However, if they choose to exercise their contract, they must provide 100 shares of stock to sell, which they will in turn recieve the money for. The shares can be purchased on the market as usual.

On the other side of the contract is the person who is selling the put, which means in the event that someone on the market wants to exercise their contract, this person must provide the cash and buy that person's stock. If a person is selling a put without the necessary cash, that is considered a 'naked' put.

Yea man that’s true. I actually just switched careers which is why I’m trying to get ahead now. Previous job was $120,000+ a year but was miserable with king hours and never being home. Took a pay cut to $50,000 so I could have my life back and not hate going to work everyday but now I’m stress about the money you feel me? In hindsight it was kind of retarded but with Nio I definitely see it going to at least $40-$50 before they find out that it’s a fraud haha
Right? It's like, y'all realize your test levels revert to whatever your natural background test level is, right? They only elevate for a brief couple days after no fapping.. then revert to the mean/background test levels you naturally have. I've found if you want higher test level naturally you have to pretty much keep your body guessing on when you're going to jerk it.. if you stick to no more than a couple times a week, you're golden.

I'm just letting you know that there is conflicting information out there from people with credentials to talk about these things. 

The director of the CDC himself urged to have young kids to go back to school because the increase in deaths from suicides and drug overdoses among young people far outnumbered the deaths from covid. 

Forcing people inside isn't healthy and has a real negative impact on people as a whole. The pros and cons need to be weighed in.

You are supporting a market crash with those numbers. Also. I own rentals and do flips. When those taxes are culled, do you think I will not pass them on to you?
I’m just saying, if you could go back in time to March 18th, buying long dated calls would have been much better than trying to squeeze out the last couple dumps with puts. 

Just think how bearish the environment is, things will be improving from here, not getting worse. You can’t make money every day and you shouldn’t trade like that’s your goal either.

I honestly can't think of any.  Most of our institutions are heavily left leaning so you don't really see the absurd right wing ideas commonly mainstream.  But it doesn't seem like you're interested in genuine discussion because "a couple kids" is very reductionist.  It seems more like your partisan desire to shit on the right blinds you to the problems of the left.  Why can't we honestly shit on both?

[Some of you on no nut November already](https://i.imgur.com/nTaeYdq.gif?noredirect)
Let’s work backwards on this shit tier post:

You don’t use the vaccine on high risk patients. You moron. Vaccines are pre-covid. Not post. They see no benefit in the risk/reward structure giving dying patients regeneron. That means it should be administered earlier. 

The stimulus will happen 1) immediately after a trump win is confirmed (as early as Friday unless there’s a blowout) or 2) Immediately after Biden is confirmed winner because republicans have no face to save if they gotta wait four years. Nothing to gain by stalling. 

China doesn’t give a fuck about Covid. They’ve been hiding numbers for months and they know for sure the world is gonna turn on them when this blows over. 

Small business America will survive. Anyone who couldn’t weather the storm is already out so they don’t need loans. Everyone else figured out how to make it work. 

Shorts are gonna win until they don’t, and when shorts start losing in big numbers, with velocity, it’s gonna pump the market even more. Poorly timed shorts after vaccine news (November-December) or a surprise stim and goodbye shorts, hello pump town. 

Ain’t no one locking down. Boris was more of a “recommendation”. America, short of like 4 blue states, ain’t shutting shit down. Half of America doesn’t believe Covid is a big deal.
