Like how project veritas‚Äô corporate finances show mcdonal trump and his election campaign being one of the main financiers? 

Or like asset money, like ivanka getting all sorts of ip from china, or manufacturing and tariff free shipping from china?

Or like how trump plays gold in mar a lago and pays himself millions of taxpayer $$$

Am i doing this right or should i just yell George Soros follow the money!!!!

Went long on a lot of JD positions today. Between stimulus and a better economic outlook regarding China stock with a probable Biden victory (boo, sorry), I don‚Äôt see how these can go tits up. 

JD gains on days BABA is stagnant, and also pushes when BABA does. Their financials aren‚Äôt as good, but they still look like a great long term play IMO.

It would be pretty fantastic if Trump makes the entire country watch him lose a second time.
Sorry for the dumb question but I just joined this sub, have tried reading some articles on options. 
So the stock is currently at $3.13 now, you're buying a call option that expires fri 11/20 to buy at $5? so you're hoping the stock will be well over $5 at that time to make money? 
and if it goes over $5 before 11/20 you're still golden right? sorry again i'm reading the faq and just trying to figure out a real world example of the jargon. thanks for your help in advance.

If spy includes Tesla in December, the mechanism for share purchases would be on the open exchange right? It wouldn‚Äôt be some sort of deal directly with Tesla, because the buying power of spy is derived from all of the various funds that track it right? So it would essentially be a crowded room full of buyers purchasing based off of simple supply and demand, not drawn out deals stemming from share dilution?

I've been seeing negative sentiment on SPY for next week on this sub which means it'll probably be green. You're fine.
Pltr and nio will be big green again this week dw dw
What's the symbol for the trade, I doubt it's a public company otherwise you'd be able to pull all the information off the SEC but again you probably don't know that because I don't think you know anything you're just here from politics to complain get lost.

I bought cheap calls on SPY 370 on case an election decision causes a boost, and puts at 240 in case of chaos or a second 'rona wave.

So who r fuk Monday ?
Yeah, selling options is just not free money. You sell covered calls you risk downside from decline in share prices. Sell puts and you can lose a multiple of the option value with a significant move against you. Sell naked calls and very easily you lose if the stock goes up.

I sold 15 contracts at 29c last week and sold 20 contracts at 37c this week. I told myself no way it goes that high. Both times fucked me and I probably lost like 8k total but I made way more just holding my shares. Unrealized gains of course vs realized losses. Maybe im retarded.

Desktop app is pretty good, but it can't even remember me on mobile login.
Most success I‚Äôve had in options is buying ITM or near the money calls on solid established tickers a month out. Bonus if it already hit that price intraday. Short of the index taking a sudden dump, thanks September, it‚Äôll hit again, given enough time. Less reward but safer than otm bets. 

Vast majority of my losses were when I broke from that and gave into fomo. Post split Tesla guh. And betting amzn actually moves.

All my current call options are green today 12/18s. Nio 40, aapl 115, baba 300, fb 280, msft 225, etsy 140. Except Tesla 430 :/

Lets review some failed re-elections

Hoover (R): The economy crashed and I will NOT use the government to help (great depression)

Carter (D): The economy crashed and I will NOT use the government to help

Bush Senior (R): The economy crashed and I will NOT use the government to help

**Trump**: The economy crashed and stimulus not passed is all the dems fault not mine!!! Stimulus never! Or maybe later! Or not! idk fuck! 

Seriously dem or republican why not just use your executive power to help the economy when it crashes, and when you're also up for reelection? Like????

Not sure if you‚Äôre serious but after a near death experience when his yacht sinks in the Mediterranean, he decides to sober up and we cut to two years later when he‚Äôs actually out, but finally gets arrested by the FBI. He agrees to try to incriminate his former partners by wearing a wire, but he slips a note to Donnie telling him he‚Äôs wearing a wire and not to incriminate himself. 

Donnie betrays him and gives the note to the FBI to make his own deal. Jordon does two years minimum security and ends up doing sales seminars.

Scouring my profile and finding a couple satirical comments, and then not realizing they were satire even after scrolling through all of my other comments...

I guess that confirms my suspicions about your intelligence level. This is a waste of my time so I‚Äôll just copy and paste a previous comment because you seem to have forgotten it.

> doesn‚Äôt understand how Supreme Court nominations are outlined in the constitution

> makes up the idea that republicans violated the constitution

> asks for a counter example to this make believe scenario

> thinks he‚Äôs made some sort of point
Tbf I'm a noob myself. I hardly know what I'm talking about
For shame

We would end up with Gilbert Gotffried as president.

 But most of the time they‚Äôre not actually exercised, so it seems most of the time the premium is taken without losing the actual shares? I‚Äôm not trying to be a smartass here, as I am literally retarded in this aspect. Just trying to learn.

if you undersell below a certain threshold someone is bound to buy, at least thats what im hoping for. I have a bunch of 7c and 14c that expire in Jan 22. Then again im probably exercising them anyway. Imagine the premiums for the covered calls in 2 years.

Legit retard question: you can sell calls/puts without owning the underlying shares?
There is a point when people stop counting as unemployed after they are jobless long enough.  So at some point next year unemployment is going to start dropping by like 700,000 a week whether things improve with covid or not.
Good cus i aint tryna die for no president myself and if they think theres gonna be a civil war idk who they theyre gonna be fighting. I hear demon sperm is quite formidable though.

Such solid advice fuck...wish I figured this out earlier
within the next year or two they‚Äôll be doing a lot to break into the european market, so should see massive sales increase in the next coming years, also their gross profit is currently a big net loss and my DCF projects it will break into positive with their massive amounts of sales. Their EV/Sales is standing at around 300 while their EV/EBITDA is negative.

So what are your chances of finding a buyer if you bought a NIO yearly and the price ballooned something insane? I can‚Äôt imagine finding a buyer $100+ in the money, but I also have no experience with it. Looking at my savings kind of funny.

To add on: selling covered calls is a pretty easy way to make some extra money on non-meme stocks.

Basically, you're selling your shares at strike+premium, e.g. if you sell a $10 call for 1.5, you're basically selling your shares for $11.50 each. You're solidly in the green as long as the share price stays below strike+premium. If it looks like it is going to blow past your strike, and you want to hold the shares, you can usually roll to a higher strike for a net credit by adding some time. Collecting the premium also gives you some downside protection if the stock starts to drop.

A basic strategy that is very popular among wealthier people is to own shares and sell monthly/quarterly strangles. E.g. own 10k $MSFT shares and sell 100 calls at +15% and 100 puts at -15% each month. Basically, getting paid to buy the dip and renting out your shares for cash.

You can easily get 10-20% monthly returns holding shares on stable companies this way, but you'll sometimes miss out on the massive rallies, so it's not suited for anyone in this sub. You'll also get screwed in the event of a covid-type crash if you've done this on margin, but if you're holding shares, you'd be screwed short-term anyway.
The only IV this guy knows about is the one in a hospital. Without doing anything and PLTR staying at the exact same price he‚Äôll be down 55,000 come Monday. Total loss unless a miracle happens.
Not gonna lie I bought it for all the hype, played through it once and decided it was fucking gay. Don't understand why people love that game.
Depends a lot whether it‚Äôs covered (you own the underlying shares) or not.
Hail Mary, Full of Grace, The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of death. Glory Be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. x10

I have 26k in my ROTH TSP. Basically a government 401k where you have little to no control over what you invest in other than index funds. Apparently theres an option where I can roll it over to my Roth IRA. where im up 100% YTD. Having 26k (and adding 1k a month) at a 4-5% interest rate is pretty fucking pathetic and I kinda wanna have more capital in my IRA for the occasional yolo. What would my fellow autists here do? Take CONTROL of your retirement funds and either yeild -100% or 100% or be a pussy and keep the 3-5% growth.

Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is positive for COVID.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-07/trump-s-chief-of-staff-mark-meadows-infected-by-coronavirus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-07/trump-s-chief-of-staff-mark-meadows-infected-by-coronavirus)

Mike Pence hasn't been seen for 3 days. Mark gave an interview and has been in close contact with Trump and Pence over the past few days and was at an election night party with 400 people a few days ago. Mark wasn't wearing a mask.

Hypothesis: Pence is in isolation

&#x200B;

EDIT: Two other aides have tested positive. The White House has an outbreak and they're trying to keep a lid on it.[https://abc7chicago.com/politics/wh-chief-of-staff-mark-meadows-tests-positive-for-covid-19/7721271/](https://abc7chicago.com/politics/wh-chief-of-staff-mark-meadows-tests-positive-for-covid-19/7721271/)

Are we looking at a red Monday?
My opinion as an 18 year old about our military was similar to your observations, but what I distinctly remember feeling was that if I wanted to have strong opinions on the military I thought I better have experienced being in the military.  Again, the source of my guilt.  I'll also add that my very republican family did not in any way support my intent to enlist, which was simultaneously illuminating and jarring.

Regarding our commercial interests, I think many know that in their heart of hearts and the moto patriotic bullshit is just a defense mechanism.  For myself I am comfortable as a pragmatist, and that's the purpose of the military.  It was never about our freedom.  Hegemony is about protecting our economic influence, not bringing or protecting freedom anywhere.  I was comfortable with that.

I'm glad you found your own path.  Once you go down whatever road you choose, it's hard to imagine it being any other way.  We shouldn't fear the future like we do.

I said that i've been long since $6.... So im mostly likely in before you.

My point, which ive mentioned twice now, is that they wont buy back more shares. Yes they have the $100mm authorized to do so, but that doesn't mean they will.

It's not that they wont use all of it. Its that they wont use any of it. They will keep the money and use it for something better.

You're the type of guy that ill explain something twice, and you're still to daft to understand. Yet you wont hesitate to tell others that something is for sure happening, like a buyback on Wednesday or end of week.

‚ÄúCats have the physiology of a predator, meaning that they‚Äôre hardwired to give chase and hunt -- mainly at night. Large cats such as lions have a similar pattern of sleeping during the day and hunting at night. Although they have been domesticated for the most part, housecats still retain that wild streak. Even cats at play will display the feline primal instincts of creeping about in the shadows and, without a whisper of warning, pouncing on their target prey.‚Äù

So my cat is going for the jugular while I sleep huh? No wonder it sleeps so much during the day.

Red Monday. 

Economic crisis. -  Biden
Stimulus. - Biden
Covid spiraling. - Biden

NJ, CO, WY going through shutdown phases. 
Trump rampage tweets through the weekend. 
Mitch McConnell brags about lameducks through midterms. Laughs at Biden‚Äôs stimulus proposal. 
Q4 bankruptcy reporting happens on 11/13
Trump incites violence. It‚Äôs no longer time to standby. Mass violence breaks on Saturday night. These are not the bullish rights of before. These are meltdown, we are fucked type riots. 
Market doesn‚Äôt price in new riots.
Market doesn‚Äôt price in market rally. 
Next week will be the bloodiest we‚Äôve seen since February. Following an even bloodier one after that.

Buy and hold concentrated stocks (amzn, aapl, nvda, msft, fb, schw, staa, PayPal). Then was buying leaps when market tanked using previous ATH as the strike. They swelled back up pretty fast. Then sold weekly calls OTM to hedge short term bumps. Most expired worthless, some had to cover for losses.

Trump‚Äôs last hope was boosting this market. He boosted it, but it didn‚Äôt get him his victory.

Biden is not a greed filled guru like Trump. Take that however you please, just be smart & don‚Äôt regret your decisions before you make them.

You gotta forge your own path.  I sent my life on a trajectory because of what was expected of me and not what I really wanted and it fucked me up for a while.

And while I have the deepest of respect for all of our Armed Service members (including many family members including a POW) much of our military does not protect our freedom, it protects our commercial interests, I love this country and those who want to defend it, but our country abuses our young and vulnerable to save a few dollars on gas and sneakers.
It's going to be absolutely hilarious going forward.
Wait a second, a president just spoke to the nation, was quick and to the point, and we aren't all fucking freaking out about what he was just implying.  What the fuck
Imagine  writing those calls and collecting that sweet sweet premium..

This would be the closest thing to free money ever.

Key race alert: Mark Meadows has covid
It's hard seeing someone else live your dreams.
OP pointing out that fucking SPY has been unable to even reach the Sept 2nd high. It tried during the October bounce, but peaked a bit short, stagnated for a few days, and then begun a move back down. Once again, we are getting close to the Sept high, but not quite there.

Is this finally when SPY breaks through and sets a new high? Or are we about to have a couple more days in limbo before going back to test somewhere in low 320s? If it was that easy to know then we'd all be rich easy. OP sounds like he's banking on this being close to the current top, which means that we are about to trade flatish and begin another descent into the 320s over the next month.
Looks like you‚Äôre going full retard bud

Lol what problem? Are you the only person not making money in this market?
Picking 6-8 tech stocks and using margin to increase exposure when the market dips. Used options infrequently, mainly leaps. Reduced margin when market fell this spring and was buying long leaps on aapl with $300 and $330 strike out to 2022 as well as STAA leaps. This is in addition to my buy-hold portfolio. Once the leaps swelled up, was selling weekly OTM calls against them to smooth out the bumps.
If the EC didn't exist all that would change is Republicans would have to appeal to like, 4% more of the country.

That sounds fucked up, I know, but it isn‚Äôt what it seems. Anyway, WSU has blessed me with her and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for more from this school than her

my dumb ass sold covered calls on DKNG and UBER cause I figured they would go up, but not to my strike price, and of course they went over strike, then I fell asleep and didnt do anything, so I have no idea if TD just closed the calls and took my cash or sold my stocks when they closed the calls.

Yes, I‚Äôve noticed.
I was a sophomore in high school on 9/11.  I planned to join the military but ended up having some sports injuries that got me screened out.  Used to be a deep red republican with very strong opinions but going to college forced me to reexamine a lot of my own views.  Today I live in the middle.

I still feel a lot of guilt for not serving in the military.  I knew then that I would feel that forever.  I still think thats true.

   Was it worth anything?
If you mean bupolar, then yea... I fucked up and fell for a girl with it, it was a wild ride. I didnt find out she was on lithium until months into the relationship and at that point it was too late, I was attached. 

I thought I could deal with it. When she was up, it was the best. Felt like I was the best thing to happen to her, and life was great. When she was down, I felt like a villain. It's hard to have the person you love pull away for weeks or months.

Shit was bad for my mental health for sure. Since I was emotionally attached to her, in a way I was becoming bipolar. The up and down almost became like a drug and me the addict.

Getting out of that relationship was the best thing for me. It's not easy and I don't blame her, but I could not see myself living that way the rest of my life. 

Sex was fucking amazing though...

It certainly wouldn‚Äôt surprise me, especially once they land a model or two in US and EU markets. Hard to predict anything while the bulk of the capital is Chinese domestic funds, though. If they end up white labeling a vehicle for major manufacturers, I could see $100 on the rumor alone.

He's just trying to figure out how to inverse himself.
Ark disagrees with you. And this was my DD last week which bit me in the ass. I can't possibly believe that media attention on the election is responsible for the rally. People know the stimulus is coming, that's all that's needed. It comes in Jan or Feb. Doesn't matter. 

Sure there will be a small pull back but nothing like you are postulating. During these times I'm keeping it intraday.

BTW I'm super high so if what you are saying is volatility is here for a bit longer. Take my uptick.

Besides ptsd or traumatic events Instagram is really the reason for mental health issues. I deleted Twitter and insta 6 months ago and didn‚Äôt realize how much it didn‚Äôt fucking matter.

Some states were allowed to count mail in ahead of election day without announcing results until that day, like FL. other states like PA were explicitly not allowed to count mail in until after election day per the GOP state legislature. Hence the cluster. To be fair some states do a lot of mail in voting already and knew how to handle it whereas some places it was brand new and slower.

Holy fuck that‚Äôs some major gains, nice. I have 800 shares at $26. You see this hitting $100?
Shit, never heard of Stubbies. Sucks with no football. That was seriously the best part. I was there during the Jason Gesser era. Got as high as #4 in the nation I believe. Pretty great time, even the snow games.
Yea I bought a BABA leap this morning and already up 10% I think I may actually hold this and let it print for a while.

So is everyone bullish again
I've been on TTD since ipo day. I did not, in a million years, see it going from sub 600 to over 800 in a week. 

If you would have told me Monday to yolo into $100 otm weeklies and they'd be deep itm by Friday I would have gone after the weed stocks bc you were obv high. 

Also, every big tech company that crushes earnings has been getting wiped out lately. Seemed to change a bit this week tho.
Jealous of what? Your non existent portfolio? ü§°

You realize a consistent 1% a day would make you one of the greatest traders to ever live right?

Its obvious you are new to trading. Don't get toxic. Everyone has the same 1% a day mentality until they realize not even Warren butfet could do it
Biden live
Recounts rarely will result in a swing of more than 1-2k... 5-10k change would be extreme anomaly and the odds of that happening are much lower than your FD‚Äôs printing.. even if the 2 closest states flipped (Nevada & Georgia), it wouldn‚Äôt change the end result..

‚ÄúYou have commented in a post that is for *Conservatives only* and requires you to have flair.  Flair is a small card placed next to your username that describes your philosophy of Conservatism.

Technical analysis is boring using words. Graphs and figures make it easier to communicate.

But some other reasons:

Inflation: money is being printed and not only going to wall street but to main street (e.g. universal basic income). Deflation is not sustainable in long run. 

During the last great surge in gold and silver in 1980, the ratio was at 17:1. Currently its at 80:1. 

Increase in industrial demand for silver especially with solar energy in this decade.

US Dollar DXY is on a downtrend (classic head and shoulders pattern) and looks like its headed towards ~$85. Silver is inversely correlated to the dollar.
So VIX rises when there are purchases of SPY puts, particularly OTM. MMs sell them and then hedge their books by shorting ES futures.  

If those short puts become less of a liability to MMs, either due to price change to the underlying or a IV drop (or both), they will cover their ES shorts.
Computers filter by buzzwords. Look at the jobs you want. Look at the buzzwords. Use buzzwords in your resume. You don‚Äôt have to check the box on everything in the listing as long as you can check some.

You‚Äôll never make it to eyeballs if your resume doesn‚Äôt speak the language the computer filter is looking for.
Long-term hold or until a major M&A. Don‚Äôt anticipate needing the money.
If you buy deep itm, it‚Äôs just like buying discounted shares with an expiration
ok so with very extensive research consisting of browsing this thread I deduced pltr is the next meme stonk, basically surged on buyden victory, now that is fully priced in why will it keep going up?
Go ahead and commit a felony next election. Since it's so easy why not commit dozens, then watch your candidate lose by 20k and get charged a month later.

@precisiondad I can‚Äôt imagine jumping into this market after being MIA for so long, if you feel you‚Äôve been led astray by your past intuitions (which seem at least 2 years old) here‚Äôs a few tips to keep up with this fucking enigma:

1.	‚Å†The Fed is running this market. Two things are unique about this ‚Äústimulus market‚Äù: 1. The fed doesn‚Äôt lose). 2. The fed runs 10x faster than we do/than we are used to.
2.	‚Å†The news your paying attention to, outside of what corporations strategic moves, I.e. COVID, Jobs reports, EARNINGS,  anything on CNN/fox is going to give you conviction of the markets movement. This conviction is useless and a debilitating distraction. IMO the only thing worth paying attention to is the fed. Stimulus is going to make the market move higher and that‚Äôs that. And of course there is still value in innovation, can‚Äôt forget a quality strategy that creates value (great investments) so if any assumption is still on the table it‚Äôs that. People will always value innovation.
3.	‚Å†Your intuitions are telling you one thing and the opposite happens, what does that tell you? You should inverse? Fuck no. That is the first thing everyone of these dumb fucks love to question because they can‚Äôt stop losing. If you are looking to make money in the long term, do the easy thing and give it to FAANG. If your more short term oriented and want to trade in this market, you can not be concerned with movement or fluctuation. This shit probably makes your 2018 look like a walk in the park. No actually, a fucking beach day. Where you think the market is moving - does not matter. It is about reacting to prices, ignoring the noise, and eyeing opportunistic setups.
4.	‚Å†Adam Mancini is a guy on Twitter I follow who i recommend to people who are losing, he does alright.

Edit to 3: where you think the market is moving - could not matter any fucking less (and you are 50% wrong). It is about reacting to prices, ignoring the noise, and being ready for fucking anything to happen. Don‚Äôt be afraid to play both sides of the ball and know how to position yourself for variance. 

Edit: I see you‚Äôve lost money inversing recently buying puts, congrats retard. Hopefully you will learn from this and come to understand options spreads. And the type of position you‚Äôd be in right now if you did that instead. Retard. I hope you read this.

i got 1000% in 15 minutes with SNAP 42c. bought at .25, sold for 2.5.

problem was i only bought 4 contracts ($100 -> $1000)

the second problem is that i bought those snap calls as a slight hedge against my TTD puts which cost me more than my gains on snap.
I don't see a problem with this.
The only people making money on those are the bankers that created them

After uni, many moons ago, I 'learned to code' and worked on many projects, did a bit of freelancing, took a bunch of online courses. Never truly broke in to the industry, and I kind of burnt out on it, so now it's like a latent skill. It really seems like the people working on interesting projects are ultra big brain (far beyond boot camp graduate) and would die for problem solving, the rest of the jobs go to web devs in the Philippines.

Too many variables.  Calculating if the premium is a good value is basically impossible just because of market fluctuations.  Look at the break even price and if that looks good go for it.

worse business profitability/higher corp tax/higher regulation, which reduced earnings per share, and in turn lowers stock valuations. also, a stimulus package that's prolly not even gonna be much bigger than if Trump had won, and will be a whole lot later. There's no guarantee we're gonna make it to the Biden stimulus before the market crashes.

If you think it's going to go up (quickly) don't sell CC farther out than weeklies; the theta burn won't outpace the value increase of the option and the concern that you'll lose the underlying for far less than their latest value.  CC are for sideways/down trends.  Had this issue with SQ this week; had to buy back my way OTM CCs (twice) after $20 daily increases in mark.

Ok so lets run this bitch down.  
Last week of October we had Stock/Bonds/and Metals all selling off.  
This week we've had Stocks/Bonds and slightly Metals getting bought up.  
These don't normally coincide with one another. In a typical environment there's a balance between stocks and bonds by one going up and the other going down in tandem.  
Are bonds and equities both going to continue mooning together?  
Are bonds going to start getting sold off at the hopes of a stable and thriving economy?  
To expect the market to do one thing is the wrong way to approach it. Seeing what the market is capable and probable of doing... is something to keep aware of. Whether or not what the market is doing is "correct" isn't the point, the point is to ride the wave each way. Ride it hard and make money. But be prepared and ready to get out of the way when shit starts to come apparent it may hit the fan.  
&nbsp;  
This is one of those times.  
https://imgur.com/a/ApwPb6X

Can we keep going higher? Of course. Do I see us surpassing the prior two highs? No. But I will advise that if you are still in the market and we find ourselves in limbo over a couple days... watch your lips.

I‚Äôm more of the retire and do what exactly type. I enjoy what I do, it provides a living and I have no interest in the usual retire and do x. Got no one relying on me, my debts either get paid off before I die or goes bye bye when I do. 

So my ‚Äúlife‚Äôs savings‚Äù are a fluctuating pile of lumber on the stock market when I have zero interest in building a house. As long as it‚Äôs enough for the occasional emergency firewood, it‚Äôs a meaningless score I play at.

Sorry to disappoint but no, this asshole is only 9 and only pisses on rug when he gets pissed off.  No pun intended.
EA is more like a sin stock than a game stock, many people hate it but it made loads of cash, just look at madden 21 and the review bombs, but it sells like crack and are up 20%, so I would rather buy stonks on EA.

Good evening sir. Would you care to mate with my wife in exchange of a Free Stock‚Ñ¢?

Yeah I reread your post.  My smooth brain is especially spongy after the lack of sleep I've subjected myself to all week.  The first time I read it I thought your dad was going conspiracy theory about ballots being changed (by just the right number they would need).

HI ELON!
It's always a combination, day jobs make it easy to earn low 5 digits (tech industry for example) and anything more is a slog of 80h work weeks. So you switch strategy to having money work for you for the next order of magnitude, then you need a business/significant growth assets (not hands off ones like stocks or real estate). Then maybe you do some venture investments to scale up your ability to build value. At around 100mil I'd say it's basically strategy-less, and there's no easy path to 1bil other than a massive win in your portfolio like an early stage FB (regardless of you being the founder).

Yes I should clarify, selling roughly 1% OTM in the middle of the spikes during 0DTE when there‚Äôs a sudden jolt up, so today when SPY was at 350, 353/354 was going for 0.25c credit

Risky AF before I get beat down on just straight gambling here but position sizes were small 

My point was usually over 1% oTM middle of the day is like 5-7c

No, not really.  It's supposed to be failsafe, ideally never used.  Basically to prevent Hitlers from taking office.  In almost every case they should have no effect, which is generally true.

Not to mention that electors are selected based on the political status of the state, which is more directly determined by the people.

The problem is you can't necessarily trust the electors more than the average voter.

Anyway call it whatever you want but that's literally the reason the founding fathers put the system in place.

I approve this message. 69 11/30 $SPY 420 Calls, 30 11/30 $SPY 410 Calls.
high iv and subsequent iv crush. i dont sell for closest expiration as this is way too directional/binary. If you sell the day before earnings, you usually sell when iv is the highest for the period (usually) and iv gets crushed directly after earnings. I usually sell with ~45 dte but when i sell for earnings sometimes i go lower >= 21dte. with this expiration, i can close for almost max profit if the direction was right (or if it didnt move that much when i sell delta neutral) and if i was wrong (like pins and snap that moved 40% when i needed less than 20), then i can roll my strangle up and forward. For dxample, for pins, i had a 40/60 short strangle expiring nov 20th before earnibgs. pins popped to 66 so i rolled to 55/75 december 18 for a small loss
Riding spy puts through the weekend. I‚Äôll get out Monday/Tuesday (hopefully) and then I‚Äôm either shorting ACB if they pump after earnings or getting calls if they die

It's a fair point, may definitely not moon. My thesis is that it pumps on just the news a bit (regardless of bail-out or long term profitability/growth).

They could still get there! You've got no reason to even thinking of selling when you're already down 90%. If they come back up to where you've made a meaningful amount of your initial spend back, then start thinking of what you wanna do. I personally think they could hit 130 but probably not much above it if they do, unless they have some big surprise up their sleeve.

Thanks man all the adds go to my portfolio
Good, you avoided wasting more of your money. The price shown is not the last sold price, it's the price between the bid and ask bids.   


The price shown does NOT mean that any options have been sold at that price. Check bid/ask spread before you buy. If the bid ask spread is a few cents wide, that is closer to the true value of the option. All of those calls are worth pennies per share.

The idea that a weapon would be banned in war but allowed domestically does come across as rather absurd. But like with many things, there is more nuance than might appear on the surface. 

Under the CWC tear gas falls into the category of "harassing agents" also known as Riot Control Agents or RCAs. During the long process that lead to the CWC RCAs were something that was subject to a fair bit of negotiation and debate. The main debate centered not so much around law enforcement, but on military use outside of warfare. For example when rescuing personnel from a downed aircraft when hostile civilians are present or dealing with hostile crowds at bases or embassies. There were countries that pushed for more strict bans or regulations, but the US took a hard line pushing for their use and even the modest restrictions in the CWC would be a sticking point in it's ratification in the Senate.

The final draft stated that ‚ÄúEach State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare." and contained a specific exemption for law enforcement. 

There were a few main justifications given for this discrepancy. 

The first is that in war things like tear gas are often used to increase effectiveness of other weapons i.e. a force multiplier. For example, you might use it to flush people out of a bunker so you can attack them. Or to force them into an area where they might be surrounded or encounter mines or other risks. This is, or ideally is, less of a concern when used domestically or in non-warfare situations. Dispersing a crowd is often an alternative to more lethal means, not an attempt to lead them into fire or harm. Without RCAs, the only option may be to use lethal force. 

RCA programs and delivery systems can also be used to cover for other chemical weapons. There is no easy way to tell if a projectile contains an RCA or a deadly gas or what a factory might be able to produce. This can lead to confusion or provide cover for more nefarious weapon development. If one combatant sees the other preparing chemical shells, they would have no way of knowing if it is tear gas or something like mustard gas. Warring parties are not exactly going to trust each other or assume the best.  In contexts outside of warfare this is less of a concern. 

The method of use is also much different. Law enforcement and non warfare use often involves small scale delivery systems. Even if they fell into the wrong hands, the harm they cause is limited. The use of RCAs in warfare often involves delivery systems that can spread it over a very wide area. A tear gas canister being fired into a crowd is going to cause some pain and discomfort, but people can generally get away to fresh air. A wide area weapon could blanket a city in gas giving people nowhere to go. Not allowing their use in warfare ideally would discourage the development of these systems. 

There is also concern that their use would lead to further escalation. This is basically what happened in WW1. The use of tear gas lead to more toxic gases and eventually to a horrific chemical arms race. This was despite a ban on poison gases in the 1899 Hague Convention. By banning all chemical weapons in war, the idea was to prevent such an escalation from beginning in the first place. Again, outside of warfare this is not really a concern.

You answered your own question - they're morons.
I was talking about put credit spreads.  Call crdit spreads are almost never worth it unless your playing a condor imo.  Premium is apways much better on puts.  Either way, 0dte you only have 3 exp per week. To pull a 59% return you would need to be scalping left and right or selling something very close to ITM at open.  No chance are you making 59% selling 2% OTM on exp day

Edit:

I wnt and checked. At EOD today spx put credit spread 2% OTM will yield 5% gain. Thats about a .1 delta.  To get a 59% return over the week you would need to be selling approx .25 deltas or higher on the morning of.  So basically 1% or less OTM

The boot camp project is usually enough, and the bar is not that high right - nobody's paying 150k for detroit coal miners, and I've mentored bad coders and seen them improve. I'd say as long as you get more than you put in in terms of time spent mentoring by your good coders, you're okay. 

Leetcode and similar for IQ, but that's an unnecessary filter IMO

If the project isn't enough then you either let them down or tell them to add a couple of features and see how they do. Or take them on as a contract while you teach them. Many ways to slice it if you think people can fundamentally be productive coders.

Of course some might not make it, but my prediction is that the unemployment costs of those folks can be swallowed. A corporate UBI if you will, in return for some PR and maybe a state-sanctioned monopoly for a while, like an "automated job patent"

I can see big data/SQL might come into play but ultimately financial decisions - if they are not purely driven by algorithms (say like RenTech) should come from people with financial knowledge. Or at least let's say I am interested in that part of investing/funds/managers where accounting, valuation, and broad financial knowledge on top of some software and technical skills are needed.
I know, but there are still some decent places that arent closets with a tiny backyard and nice area that I can get in oakville for 600-700k.

Can anybody explain to me what the fuck PLTR does?
Not necessarily. It doesn‚Äôt mean the state is going to sell the drugs. It just means if you have them on you, you won‚Äôt be arrested. 

You would still have to go through illegal routes to buy it. Drugs should be decriminalized, drug addiction is a mental health problem and should be treated like one. Decriminalizing drugs opens a lot of doors to recovery and understanding addiction with drugs. 

People who will do hard drugs are going to do them, decriminalizing won‚Äôt make someone go ‚Äúoh I wanna go get addicted to heroin now‚Äù. It‚Äôs more of looking at drug addicts as human beings with problems rather than looking down on them
thats honestly a good trade off. your brain practically doesn't feel the difference, and on the plus side you don't have to deal with other humans bullshit

Your process is very similar to mine. I boil on low heat when I first infuse and then boil once a week every week by putting the whole bottle in a pot so the grease re liquifies. I did add a decent amount of pure maple syrup also. When it‚Äôs time I freeze and also poke a whole through the fat and then strain through a cheese cloth or coffee filter. I‚Äôm not even a bourbon person myself by I just like to experiment. It‚Äôs cool to talk to someone else so strangely shares a very very similar process as myself.
BYND is expanding rapidly in China, and a Biden victory means it‚Äôs easier for them to continue to work with China. Also, implementing green policies and education will get people notified about how wasteful and pollution generating factory farming is. BYND is definitely a long term play, but I can definitely see a run up to 250 within the next year if Biden wins so they dot have to worry about trade wars and they can expand in peace.

I‚Äôm doing one of the dumbest things I have ever done and holding puts though the weekend.... I really think at this point most of my risk has been absorbed so fuck it see if there is reward....
A covered call is you selling a call to another retard and then you have 100 shares that you put up as collateral. You have to have 100 shares to sell 1 call. If the price goes above your calls strike price then your shares get sold to the call holder for that price. If the price doesn't rise above the calls strike price then you keep your shares and now collected 95 calls worth of premium. 

So you could sell 95 $45 calls that expire 11/13 and make 11k in premium. If it goes to $45, your shares get sold at 45 and you keep the 11k in premium. If it doesn't then you keep your shares and 11k . Im drunk but I tried

Looking for some genuine feedback.

Moderna and Pfizer will report vaccine results this month. Very likely to immediately apply for emergency authorization if remotely positive. Theater stocks are pretty much as low as they are gonna go at this point. Seems like a good risk/reward to play some OTM calls on the better ones.

Reasons this won't work: vaccine results are delayed, vaccine results are bad, AMC tanks the sector like the piece of shit that it is by going bankrupt, theaters only get a slight bump on vaccine announcement. The "theaters are dead, netflix is the future" argument isn't relevant in the short term.

Positions: 11/20 and 12/18 calls on CNK and IMAX, various strikes.

Thoughts?

Just did 10x VXX 11/20 $24C. I know nothing about stocks but I looked at the lines and i noticed a trend with the lines going up and down. Currently it's down so hopefully it'll go up. If it does even a few percentage points that can mean a serious pay day. Thanks for the heads up.

i bought bunch of tlry on the same reasoning. It tanked Tue, i held, it came back up yesterday a bit and I sold with a meager profit and I see this today. What made you hold even after yesterday's pop ?

Yeah I lost like 3 grand in otm calls when it was like 2 or $3 a share. If I'd have just bought the stock I wouldn't be kicking myself about it. Did buy some but at like 20.
Can someone tell me how to use margin for buying options on Etrade? I see my margin buying power (let's say 2x of my cash) but it won't let me to use it for buying options. For most stocks (even not all) I can go above my cash when purchasing.

Trump was an excellent businessman and therefore more competent at deal making than any politician America ever had. Meanwhile Biden will just cause civil unrest due to his volatile personality.

Creditor vultures circling over Trump right now.
puts on the triple qs... just waiting for jimmy chill to say, you dont trade baba you own it...
He's talking about 0dte though, which I assume means he was opening the position on day of expiration. So if he got that kind of return in the week on just 0dtes, maybe was more like 2% OTM day-of, and he was specifically going with put credit spreads? Of course he could also be doing not that far OTM towards end of day which is why I was asking on that.

Tom Cruise is still yet to come out the closet
I forgot, what‚Äôs the episode?
[removed]
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My recommendation? Stay away from leaps. Stay away from options actually. At least for a while. A few months to a year. Only do stocks if you must and only blue chip stocks. Why? Because you should only do options if you‚Äôre ABSOLUTELY certain about a move in a certain direction. trust me. I switched to leaps and I kept bleeding money. A few months back i bought leaps in Yelp, Cruise Lines, and Vegas in anticipation of the vaccine news in early/late November and that never happened. Had to sell at a huge loss. The election, the pandemic, and other uncertainties are still there so that‚Äôs why I would be careful with leaps and options in general. I have more solid tips if you‚Äôre want but that‚Äôs it for now. Sorry again for your loss, hang in there. Is your college fun at least? Hope you still get the campus experience.

Yea agreed.  This is why playing options is kinda dumb if you are going long.  Just hold the shares and never look at them again.   But a portion of your account needs to follow the strategy above.  Maybe 30% /40% hold stocks forever like maybe faang or spy and play with rest
also deported more people than Trump, I think...

Or dems used common sense by telling folks to vote through absentee ballots since many are fearful of going in densely packed areas.

If you don't like her, I'll chime in.

I have a lot of female friends under the conditions: not into any of them, never buy them things (flowers on the birthdays of my best friends only, and they never ask for them), and never be an emotional tampon.

&#x200B;

I've discovered maintaining female friendships under aforementioned conditions allows me to be more dateable/seen as dateable by girls I actually like.

&#x200B;

If the friendship can get you something out of it, it wouldn't be bad to try to listen to her situation. But listening means she needs to be there to listen for you down the line, and no two people should lean on each other: that's just delaying adulthood.

&#x200B;

If she can give something back to you in the friendship, don't discard right away. Female friends that DONT take advantage of you contribute a lot to your overall game with girls you want to actually bang. Serious.

Great picks! AMD is only going higher, they got 3 analyst upgrades in 2 days and price targets moved to 96-100 bucks or another 15% upside.

XLNX immediately adds benefit to the company overall and diversified them into new sectors. Big big things to come

It‚Äôs because Fox News and the AP fucked up and called AZ for Biden too early. Now everyone is being overly cautious because if they legit call NV for Biden, it‚Äôs over, but they don‚Äôt want to be wrong.

Also the 2000 bullshit happened because the networks called it for Gore, and Fox called it for Bush, and it allowed both sides to claim victory. Bush would not have ‚Äúwon‚Äù without the resulting confusion.

Utterly.
You can do the first one, it's just much harder. Go to a trade school and learn high paying blue collar work if college is too daunting. But get a shit job first if you're homeless, get what resources you need, local churches probably have food drives, shelters will probably have resources to help you get on your feet. 

For the last one, get insanely lucky. But if you're homeless with a hundred bucks, you don't belong on the stock market. Start saving those pennies for a damn security deposit on a shit hole apartment. Move to the damn Midwest if that's too much, cost of living is cheap as fuck. You're not gonna magically get rich, life's dealt you a shit hand, I get that, I'm sorry, but you still have the capacity to claw your way up, it'll just be hard.
Stonks don‚Äôt really go up.  They go up while you least predict  them to and by the time you make a move they start going to sideways and start bleeding.  This is why playing a bear is more fun.  During euphoric times,  while everyone is exited and making money,  slowly build your bearish position and stay patient because when the drop happens, it‚Äôs usually fast and beaucoup tendies all to yourself when everyone is caught off guard.   And then reverse on way up.  In short,  always move in opposite direction.  Following trend works to only a certain extent and you gotta be prepared to move the other way

I have followed PLUG since it was at 9(which is not that long ago) they have some big partners with the fuel cells they put in hand trucks (AMZN, WMT) I have watched interviews with the CEO and this dude sounds giddy about meetings with big money investors which he cant mention. That being said I sold my calls today because I had already made over 70% on them but I kinda regret not holding because I feel like this earnings "could" be their breakout
Hope you guys bought your puts. States are gonna start locking down again as ICUs fill up

Ok frankly find a middle ground. On September 2, one of my accounts was $175K (built up from just $5K few weeks back, thanks ZM and CRM). Then it fell to $80K on the next day and $20K in a few more days. I just watched it stunned. So Rule #1 Book profits 
Today I had ACB in green by $15K so I sold and it went up $15K more (which I just watched). SQ I sold 15 calls yesterday at $7K profit but today would have been $20K more. Lastly NET, took $3K profit today but could have been $6K. So, Rule #2, sell enough that you recover the capital and say a 50% profit. Let the rest play - all the way to the end.

Guys how to delete a subreddit
It‚Äôs not trading your soul. It‚Äôs pretty good actually.

When we had an office I got to go to work at my desk with a nice monitor (or two). We had free snacks, drinks and coffee. We got lunch and dinner catered.

Got a 401k match. Restricted Stock Unit package from my publicly traded company. Good health, vision and dental coverage.

My job involved mostly being in meetings/collaborating, reading people‚Äôs code and figuring out how to write the code for what the company decided to do.

Writing the code feels like problem solving and building a structured way for a computer to follow directions and do what you want. I personally build iPhone applications, which I love.

My salary can be found on https://levels.fyi
Tampa hard rock casino is only an hour away from my new house in Orlando. That‚Äôs not a bad drive at all I can do that
While I agree with you on this front that the Chinese are hard academic workers they STRONGLY lack social skills. To a degree that you could not imagine unless you went to one of these top school. I graduate UC Berkeley back in 15' (Go Bears;not gay bears) and the lack of social skills was incredible. You couldn't ask one of these people anything without them shitting their pants and forget about even trying to have a conversation. For this reason alone they will never take over the US. American have some of the best social skills and NO problem expressing themselves or their views. The chinese are quiet kind people but repression is ingrained in them like you wouldn't believe. My two cents.

Actually, that is 11.6% per year (multiplicative per year, and the correct measurement).  If measuring additively that's 20% (of price 10 years ago) per year.
Yes, but actually no.
What‚Äôs the play?
$SPY averages +6%, that means some years it is below that and some years it can be up. With massive government tendies on the way it makes no sense for it to go down next week.

People are retarded, I honestly have no idea outside of the thing being stolen (gamestop apparently reaches out to the police quite a bit for stolen stuf).  But for some reason people sell them used.  Maybe it will be a little less common now with online returns, but either way people will still sell them.  I don't believe it will be a number worth talking about in the first month, but the fact that people start selling them so early bodes well the longer the console is out.

It is pretty awesome for them though.  Amazon/best buy/walmart sells an xbox to Mr HerpDerp, who sells it to gamestop for half of what he paid.  Gamestop resells it for roughly the cost of a new one, then gets revenue sharing from MSFT on all game purchases and subscriptions purchased on that xbox until it gets thrown away.

Yes I agree completely, but thats more on the student compared to college itself.

The debt also  sucks, and its ran as a business in the US just like healthcare which is a terrible approach for the common person. 

Theres a trash stigma around school and it sucks. As a student, I hate it as well. Everyones parents forces them to go to school RIGHT AWAY, 'oh well! youll figure out what you want ' and give us no time to research and learn what we want. So instead alot of students end up getting rekt by debt with degrees that dont pay good money
TLDR imo the workforce is changing and people need to be more adaptable and be competent across numerous fields. The mindset of being adaptable and being able to pick things up quickly is much more useful than one‚Äôs BS in kinesiology.

It's more like implied margin. For a relatively small price you hold contracts that represent an option to control and profit from a large amount of shares, without the obligation to pay for them.

It's like insurance on an unexpected large move within a specified period of time. If it happens, you make bank. If it doesn't, your insurance payment was just a loss.

There's safer ways to play, but you won't learn that here.
Wait until you learn about television shows or product placement in movies. Your world will be shattered.

Possibly, I know business administration and psychology are up there too.

There's nothing in PA to litigate. Biden will win without any of the "late arriving" ballots that are being contested.

Edit: To reiterate, the ballots being counted now are mail in ballots received on or before election day. There is nothing controversial about them. The main reason it's taking so long in PA is Republicans there made a dumb rule that they couldn't start counting them until the polls closed on Tuesday.

How to write a price
Know your goal. Is this for fun, or a real part of your portfolio? I don't play a game for fun, so this is my only "game" and I take it seriously.  

You can find general stuff online but most people posting that stuff is from an intellectual point. Not saying it's not useful, but they most likely didn't utilize it. Once you make money in this game, you turn into rentech and get anal as hell about giving info away. Since it's up to 50% of not just my portfolio, but family members since I'm not just managing my own money, it's essentially attacking my family to gloat my own intelligence online.

AZ results are final if the winner wins by 0.1% (per state law). Biden only needs 3500 more votes at the end of the day and no recount takes place. I think they actually called it correctly.

- defrost if frozen  
- pat dry, sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides; i add steak seasoning as well  
- maximum heat on cast iron skillet (i go to about 480-500 F)  
- put butter on skillet  
- grill on one side for around 30s (3/4 in. thick)  
- flip and grill on other side for 30s

I've done this before. It helps to use 100 proof or higher bourbon. Once you freeze the bottle, the fat freezes to the top. Poke a hole through the fat and strain the bourbon with cheese cloth several times.

Remember, now your bourbon always has to be refrigerated since it has animal product in there.

Add .15oz of maple syrup and a pressed orange peel and a dash of barrel-aged bitters. Delicious bacon infused old-fashioned.

P.S. always helps to slow-cook the bacon with medium-low heat when separating the grease.

Elections departments across Arizona have confirmed that the claim is unfounded and that processes are in place to ensure ballots are counted, regardless of what kind of writing implement is used to fill them out.

The Arizona Republic reported that the Maricopa County Elections Department says voters are able to use black or blue ink, or Sharpies to fill out ballots. The county's new tabulation machines, which were tested many times, will count votes cast with these types of pens.

Also - how to properly grill tuna steaks: get them about 1.25 - 1.5 inches thick. Have grill super hot (500 degree plus). 1:15 on one side, then flip to the other side for 45 seconds. This will leave the nice deep color in the middle with the seared edges just started to turn gray - perfection. 

Also, Use big eye tune or blue fin tuna. Yellow fin is not as good.

yes, it all comes down to how your brain reacts to reality.

It‚Äôs different for everyone, some people like it a lot. 

For me the readings were wildly inaccurate. I couldn‚Äôt even rely on them most of the time. 

It‚Äôs an extremely expensive product that I had to fight my insurance to help pay for. 

The sensor can only be used for 10 days compared to the libre which can be used for 14 days. 

Amount of packaging and plastic use for each sensor is ridiculous. 

The dexcom had loud annoying alerts whenever my blood sugar went out of range, which I couldn‚Äôt turn off. It would go off at the worst time in the middle of classes or work meetings. I think they may have changed that since I used it. 

This last one is personal one but might be appealing to you as an investor. Dexcom has began to market their product towards non diabetics. This is mostly an ethics thing for me as people without diabetes gain absolutely no benefit from wearing a CGM. Non diabetics have to pay full price and dexcom definitely knows they can squeeze a ton of profit doing this. 

As an investment I think dexcom is actually solid. As a product I hate it lol.

I think there is a bit of miscommunication here.  I'm not talking about people selling their PS4 when they buy the PS5.  What I'm saying, is that next week, people will sell their PS5s to gamestop as used.  Yes, the ones they got in preorder and paid a lot of money for, they will start selling them to GME for half of what they paid.

&#x200B;

Do I know why? No, but it happens.  It won't be a ton next week, but it will happen, and it will gradually increase in volume over the next couple of weeks/months until it becomes a meaningful revenue number.

&#x200B;

Unrelated little bit of fun.  I'm sure you've seen the stock price charts around the previous console cycles.  There were 100 mill shares outstanding for those cycles, only 65 million now.  If it were to go back to similar market caps, The stock would have to runnup much, much further than where it did before.  I don't really expect it to hit those valuations unless they continue with their transformation successfully, but its fun to think about.

TLDR; just try it with money you're not afraid of losing and see what happens.

I've come pretty close to pulling the trigger on PSTH and really like some of the potential targets but looking into Bill Ackman I don't really like his history.  Why would any of these mature unicorns be convinced to align themselves with him?
If you make $0 a month and borrow 100$ from your wife‚Äôs boyfriend, then turn that into 1 million maybe your mom will love you by then.
I still can‚Äôt fucking believe I got 2500% on my March ACB calls today. Every time my stupid portfolio is on life support, I get some bullshit win to bring me back to life.
They are
Sold half for $100k profit
doubt.

what state?

(Unless you talking ‚Äòprovisional‚Äô ballot)
I'm super ignorant about options, but at the end of the day I see it as massive leverage. I already trade TQQQ which guarantees I never have a margin call. Why would I tip my toes into options of TQQQ?
I just had 200x SPY 270c 11/6 expire worthless today and I‚Äôm very down on VXX. Fuck this retard market.
To the tits bruh

man. tsla needs to start moving, why would i buy an option with -1 theta and 0.5 delta.

The drawn out count is by design. Some (Republican) legislators wouldn‚Äôt allow ballots submitted early to be counted before the 3rd... in the hopes of fooling dumb people like you!
Long ROPE calls
Robinhood changed their up and down prices from arrows to triangles and I don‚Äôt like it
When I swipe my Robinhood debit card between your butt cheeks you better laugh up to the balls
Give me a good mountain climbing movie that's not about Everest
It won't. 

I'm holding calls.
Oh. Sorry. So the premise is that puts tend to be more expensive than calls when you buy or sell them so basically you can balance your bets by buying 1 ITM put to 4 OTM calls with a price ratio of 80% to the calls and 20% to the puts. 

This way all you do is sell the put(s) for the price of the entire transaction if it goes against you and then the calls just run free until either a stop point or expiration, whichever you choose.

So if it was 1000 you would put 200 into puts and 800 into calls with the calls being the real bet and puts only needing to quintuple if it goes against you terribly and covers all losses buy probably renders the calls absolutely worthless which if you are hunting huge volatility should not be too hard.

Probably, that‚Äôs why I already sold my calls lol

The 10th premarket I believe. I'm going to load up on some calls cause corsair is the shit. I buy all kinds of corsair gear and honestly outside of custom/ultra high end stuff, they are the best.
How much capital?
Starting eh?
I thought he has his stock sells pre planned
Until it doesn't. Obviously I believe in apple if I'm holding 7k in calls, but lets be honest the market is so volatile it can do literally anything it wants right now
With 100k you can buy 150-200k worth of shares as well.
 I work at a bank in CA and everyone and their step mom has been buying houses and getting mortgages through RKT.. ALL IN

I just remember flares tbh. GAY ASS MODS kinda fucked it up with these damn inmate numbers tho
Wtf is this a thing people actually do?
$300 spy puts expiring Monday?  Is this even possible?
Definitely a long term hold though. Imagine how many governments in developing countries will want their tech to remain in control.

Yea they don‚Äôt do that here you literally show up give name they give you ballet.
If you invested 1k in Berkshire Hathaway in 1964 and never put a dollar more into it, you'd have 27 million dollars. If you put an extra 1000 in each year you'd have over 100 million. 2.7 million % return, or 20%/year every year, for 56 years straight. What in the actual fuck.
Well aren‚Äôt you so intellectually superior.
Hence the air quotes on my sure-thing comment. 

I sell covered calls against my position. So the occasional down week is now worry. I concede amzn could be down next week and still fulfill my thesis of $4,000 within 12-18 mos. but you‚Äôre betting against one hell of a company.
I‚Äôve got the same strike for the apple puts. Let‚Äôs hope for red next week.

There aren‚Äôt any books I can think of that solely focus on using options for income. I know that [Tasty Trade](https://youtu.be/7XgXvyg9mOQ) has a pretty wide selection of videos that focus more on premium selling vs buying. Outside of buy-write strategies and put selling, options aren‚Äôt really mechanically set up to produce regular cash flow like actual income producing instruments/assets.

The fact that I received a ballot, it‚Äôs serial number, were recorded so I couldn‚Äôt try to vote twice.

for decades this simple system has secured the vote.

Nah UK is dope. Their people are happier than Americans, they work less, and are healthier.

Also, UK is the absolute worst example of "socialism" you could possibly dream up in western Europe. They have less social programs than pretty much anywhere else in Europe. 

If you want to be a retarded Twitter sOcIaLiSm bot, Nordic countries are a better target.

But you'd still be retarded because Nordic countries aren't socialist and their citizens are healthier, happier, and more educated than Americans. By a lot.

I am referring to stocks in general not option
Fucking call the race mods!
Today, I‚Äôve come to the realization I am a good investor and a terrible, awful, no fucking good trader.

Did the math and realized that I would be a multi-millionaire if I invested all my savings into my strong conviction longs-term stock holds like ETSY, TGT, MTCH, SEDG, SMG, ROKU, AWR, and STX over the last three years instead of ever trading options. Options have returned 40% overall from trading, and that‚Äôs with Leaps and FDs, while my biggest stock purchases were at least 100%+. What got me on this was seeing FTCH rise another 11% today while only bought one round lot prior. Even my 401k outperformed the S&P 500 by a mile, but I was only contributing more than 5% of my income to it.  

I regret ever trading options. Stocks are basically calls with no expiration and far easier.

The last 5 years have been a stable and unprecedented bull run.  Volatility destroys the value of these ETFs over time because they reset daily.

None of it matters since GME doesn't set the price. Microsoft and Sony does. GME is not gonna start charging 1000 bucks for the new consoles all of a sudden. Their profit per new console is fixed. So only way they make more money is by selling more of them. 

And as for the old last gen consoles. Supplies for them are not limited. There are plenty new old gen consoles out there for anyone to buy. The reason people usually sell their old consoles when the new ones come out is because of two things: 1. They bought the new console or 2. GME usually does a promotion of giving you extra credit towards the new console. 

So I don't know how you get to people gonna sell their old console to GME without getting a new consoles and than gonna buy the old used consoles from GME at new console retail price. 

I would say there is no correlations between the supply of new next gen consoles to the sell/demand of the old used last gen consoles. Sure some parents might go and buy a new xbox one X because the series X is sold out but that's completely because of Microsoft's stupidity in naming their consoles.
3X options only for day trading, weeklies at most. Rust kills previous gains on flat days and reverse splits common. JNUG 5 year chart should cure the idea you have. Imo buying atm options at least 3 months out on dips while keeping earnings and div in mind for when you plan to take profits and close positions. No schemes are foolproof and when you think you bought calls cheap a big red candle will fuck your world up.Plan about 20 - 40k in losses before you will be consistently profitable trading options. Sounds expensive but you can't put a price on being completely dead inside and enjoying giant losses almost as much as gains. Good luck.

hopefully you learn risk management before blowing up a really big account. you really shouldn't be putting yourself in a position to lose all your money in the first place.
Why Trump is the way he is...

He had a childhood full of too little love and attention from his parents, and too much admiration from strangers due to wealth and prominence.

It hollowed out his self esteem. His self worth became entirely dependent on praise, and heavily damaged by criticism. He never had to grow past that because he had a life that could afford him a full time entourage of admirers. He's now caught in a psychological nightmare of needing everyone around him to think he's the greatest of all time at everything.

He compartmentalizes and ignores any thought of failure, personal faults, or mistakes, to the point of pathology. He honestly believes any success is because of him, and any failure is because of somebody else. There's no other way he's capable of interpreting it. He can't be honest with himself, which is why he can't be honest with us.
Lol why not just use your 800 credit to buy a Tesla at 1.9% interest duhhhhhhhhhhhh

WSB pumped VALE

RKT, purple, and lots more
This is the way.

I just can't STAND seeing $100k in shares when it could be $60k in options.
No one has any beef with investigating votes. It happens every election, and litigation is part of the process.

Rioting and intimidating vote counters is not okay. The president himself saying he won and it's been stolen is not okay. And now there are bomb threats at the polling centers and they intercepted armed gunman on their way to the counting center.



Hillary never got on stage and said "I WON THIS IS A FRAUD, COUNT LEGAL VOTES," inciting her followers to rally against democracy.

Can't even compare this absolute absurd, dangerous nonsense to the hurt feelings in 2016.


And for the record, if you think Trumpers aren't saying things far worse than " not my president," then you ain't paying attention. Tons of them are claiming they want to take to the streets and kill liberals.

Bud, I finally unloaded my remaining Jan 2022 calls I had bought in Jan 2019 today. Total profit? $113. I can't believe I'm finally acb bag free, feels nice. Never expected that fill to pop up on my phone this am.

Yeah I really did pussy out. I regret it so fucking much.

Options strategy 1: CALLS ALKS

ALKS 3831 - schitzophrenia and biponal disorder managment drug with considerably less weight gain effect.

Maket dominated by generics. Will this USP be enough to create a need?

"Drug-induced weight gain has been identified as a major risk factor for various medical disorders that might be responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality rates of patients suffering from schizophrenia."

At an average price of Zyprexa is 5000 per patient per year and 8.4m potential patients in the US only, with 4% market penetration, revenues are estimated to be around 1.5bn, increasing revenue two fold over time.

FDA meets for PDUFA (approval decision) 11/15/2020. Buy order must be placed by then.

Market seems not to be aware of current potential. Stock is currently flatlining.

Increased weight gain effectiveness vs market leader Zyprexa clear and substantial within clinical trial.

Less side effects (adverse effects) across the board (deadly, discontinuarion, serious, passive) experienced than main competitor. Marginal difference, but still safer. The main ones are weight gain, fatigue, and somnolence.

Lack of compatibility with opioids poses approval risk. Deadly combination. Most of the AdComm panel said labelling could be a solution while a select few were not as trusting. The AdComm panel votes Yay 11-4 Nay votes.

Zyprexa non generic still makes around 3bn in sales per year. If this is anything to go by and pricing is at a similar level, ALKS 3831 with its better safety and reduced symptoms could be enough to kill Zyprexa and gain most, if not all of its maket share. This is assuming none of the generic buyers go for ADXL 3831

Conclusion: Clear opportunity, market hasnt reacted yet. Increased safety makes aproval almost certain. Buy calls between 11/9/2020 and 11/13/2020 OTM, preferably at a strike of 17$ or 18$. Expiry 20Nov2020. Market may not react until after confirmation, if increased safety net is wanted, buy 18Dec2020 Expiry with a higher strike.

I just checked INO... wow... what the hell happened. It was the talk of the town back in May- July.
Most likely, I spend a lot of time there talking with them beautiful scrubs.
I don't think it's a joke or a bit lol. Most of this sub is doing the adult, legal version of a "get rich quick" scheme. Everyone wants to throw their money at the stock market and try to hit it big to retire early and avoid working. Kinda sad, but also... I'm kinda with them. The idea of working for the rest of my life just feels depressing and inescapable.

He is post-WW2 era, sensible type of man. The standard boomer comparison doesn't go up since he will legalise weed. He is the type of guys who listens, which is why he is/was considered such a great dealmaker.

I‚Äôve almost made $25k of actualized gains this year. Not bad for an impulsive panic-selling degenerate who‚Äôs been doing this since March. I‚Äôm thinking about pulling all my original capital out and just using the $25k profit to trade and build. Thoughts?
Yes because that'll clean up the sub. How about we do what needs to be done and ban idiots like you.

But can the biden news really inverse the consistently abysmal earnings that Aurora reports?
The time to do this was two or three weeks ago. What a fuckin retard.
I worded the edit wrong. I fully expect them to crush the earnings. When they reported Q2, price dropped because they stated Q3 historically is less for them. I also could be imaging that but I remember being really confused when it tanked after Q2 ER
Anyone else bought NIO calls at the top and bagholding them over the weekend or am I just retarded?
It is when it's an obvious desperate conspiracy theory made up by the president, which is obvious to anyone with basic critical thinking skills.

He claimed fraud in 2016, then won.

Then 2 months ago, he started claiming fraud again.


He literally always claims fraud in case he loses. It's absolute nonsense.


Also, a lot of democrats believed there was Russian interference in 2016, but they didn't lose their minds and start rioting at vote counting centers. They didn't get on TV and try to destroy democracy. And they were actually *right,* as we now know.

US GDP was 34% up this quarter meaning yoy we are only down 2%. Last 2 quarters US GDP was down 33$.

Demand is still high enough, which I am also finding unusual, but unemplyoment is decreasing down to 6%, which is a good sign. I dont see why a sitmulus is needed if unemployment reduces to 5%? The only problem could be forced shutdowns.

Demand is definitely there, people dont give a shit about their lives, go to any resutarant in Florida and you can see yourself.

I have all my money except my 401k on PSTH. I‚Äôm like 95% sure it‚Äôs going to be a fintech company, most likely stripe. Wells Fargo bought a 4.9% stake in the company (PSTH), and Stripe uses WF as their ODFI (ACH transactions flow through them for stripe). Wells Fargo is getting fucked in the ass because they don‚Äôt have a strong investment banking division, so they need to pivot into fintech to stay relevant (I work for them and we are eating ass). Wells Fargo wouldn‚Äôt make such a big investment in an industry that isn‚Äôt in their sector, no way at all. If it‚Äôs stripe (or Robinhood, possibly), then this thing will go to the moon

Nah man, you're overcomplicating this. 140% gain means initial value plus 140%, and initial value is always represented as 1, so a $50 position becomes $120 aka worth 2.4X.
If you start with $5k, it will only take 5 trades of 30% profit in a row to pass $25k if you keep reinvesting the profit 

Compounding gains > 10 baggers
You made this up but I'm loving it

I'd argue that fair elections are more important. Ofcourse he'll never personally accept it but that doesn't really matter so long as he leaves in January. I imagine the transfer of power closer to January will probably still be peaceful, it just doesn't *seem* like it will be right now.

1. Unemployment benefits up to 10 months away from March 2020 will expire for most people (less back payments that the government has to pay) 

2. Eviction moratorium will end allowing landlords to evict non-paying tenants 

We stall and deal with this other bullshit until late January is my guess

Before earnings,  volatility is usually high since its unknown event.  So you wantto wait after earnings when volatility is low.

You can use this site to see where the volatility is :

Well  140%=1.40x. You were right. I think you just didn‚Äôt account for the compounding effect. Ex. 50x1.4=70, so 70 is the profit+ the 50 principle= 120. 120x1.4=168 profit + 120= 288 and you do that 30 times

Where did they announce this?

I just downvoted your comment.
 
# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.

It's not hypocritical to say the same petty shit all the Trumpers said in 2016, to mock them.

Mangoloids literally started this whole petty "Liberal tears snowflake" bullshit, so it's fucking hilarious to watch them cry and dish it back to them.

Yes but one could also argue that peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of every democracy too.

Even when Bush won in Florida, it was about accuracy not fraud. Every president so far has conceded when the vote was clear.  The clock is ticking and Trump doesn't have to concede today, but all signs point to him  never accepting the election result. That's new

yes I'd exercise them and convert to theta gang.  It's not sexy but it will take away quite a bit of extreme downside risk while still being long.  NIO is almost certainly going to go through a consolidation phase or even a pullback phase.  Lock in the gainz take the shares and sell CCs while IV is still through the roof.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

If not it won't break out of 50 target. Citi don't know shit

we would need a massive depression during a democratic presidency to wipe out so much economic benefit that won't happen as long as the printing keeps going at some point the market will crash it will crash into a depression no matter how much they print and we're not there yet we need to go to through a full-scale depression to end wokness

Yes the most conservative out of all the judges. Ever since Biden tried to fuck him over with Anita Hill like almost 30 years ago, he's hated them personally. But it most likely is 9-0.
Mostly the analogy to 2007-8. The 2007 crash came out of the blue. The bankrupty was announced the year after, after what was likely damage control under government supervision.

The Feb Crash this year was, let's call it the prophetic crash. I think we haven't seen the real crash yet, because that would involve lifting the information quarantine on concerned financial institutions.

To my knowledge, the Fed can only postpone the announcement of bankruptcy with short term liquidity. Once the news is out, dollar AND markets should tank.

I lost about 500 in NIO puts I bought as hedges Thursday and you know what it was worth every fucking penny.  I can't predict the future most of the time anyways.  Shit could have dropped 10% for all I fucking know.  And if it did I would have lost 10% instead of 80% on my calls.  As is I made 250% on my calls as the big drop never happened.

Dude, big fucking deal - so you actually gotta start now from where everyone of your age group starts anyway. Write down what you learned and be happy that you made those mistakes before you actually had some serious amount to invest!

My mantra is: if you make mistakes early in your investment career, it really helps to not lose everything at a later stage and might well be worth it.

From one video I saw, a nio es6 and a model x  performance version both travelled 40km, model x range dropped by roughly 40km and nio 80km. Despite the hype and baas feature, they still have a long way to go. Also supposedly it costs 3mil yuan to build a battery swap station and they are reining back on that front.
What a nightmare that would be.
Don‚Äôt chase. That‚Äôs an expensive lesson, but if you can step back & learn from it (do more research, paper trade, learn proper risk management & capital preservation) then it will be worth it.

Also - there‚Äôs no shame in just deleting this sub & investing in long term holdings.

Today, I have the honor of reintroducing you to Trump ‚Äî better known to many as ‚Äúü•≠‚Äù.

Born June 14, 1946, Husband to Melania, ex to one more immigrant and an American, Father of five children (known), affair with 7 known pornstars while married, 17 grandchildren, bank-rupter (11C), friend and storyteller/story-maker to all else who meet him.

We are here today to remember the volatility and bull market he leaves in America. It was a long and simple bull market: never complex and always with enough dips for bulls to fucking buy them.

I would never say I liked him, or even most of his policies, but what I would say is there is no one else in the world, trader me would have wanted as a president. 
While I‚Äôm sure he would enjoy all this bragging about how much we love and already miss him, he was never someone who appreciated the overly poor. 
He would much rather see us liking him from a distance. 
Remember, this is a man who likely did not realize how big a deal his tweets were and how they affected thousands of retards at wsb. 

So please join us, after this weekday concludes, at the Weekend discussion thread for shit-posting and DDs.
That's as likely as my GME 16 11/27 printing.

He's old and he's a vocal Trump supporter so he's expecting the market to crash. 

But since he's old, getting out of this bubble of a market at all time highs is the smart move, regardless of which party you support. The greedy dummies are going to lose their retirements because they couldn't bring themselves to cash out of a high "bull" market and move to something safer.

Biden didn't court Latinos.  He said he didn't need them. And the dems took African Americans for granted. 


Here what every Lilly white lib needs to know. Latino and African Americans are probably more conservative and religious than your annoying uncle.   They align way more with the gop but the gop is so racist and dumb that they can't figure that out.  

The dems don't run on policy. They run on feelings and dreams. They also don't actually push against the gop at all becuase the leadership is all old af and they think it's still the 80 or 90s, that the country is still filled with reganites and don't want to offend them.  They are extremely disconnected and old af.  If they elect Nancy on the house again at least they are fucked. 

I'd say the dems have one more election to figure this out before 3rd party comes along and makes them irrelevant.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. It seems to me that COVID is kind of a weird spot where it is pretty damn lethal but not enough to keep people who aren't at major risk scared for a whole year

they haven't called it because calling an election is declaring a winner. There's no winner until we count all the votes or its impossible for Trump to come back based on the votes counted and votes outstanding. You can go suck on your 5% comeback chance though.

>Were discussing mcconnells motivation to pass stimulus.

Yes. 

>Mcconnell has no interest in dem base. 

Disagree, and don't understand why you'd think that. He is interested in having the dem base become disenfranchised or otherwise less likely to vote. 

>Mcconnell is interested in right wing base. 

True, not not exclusively. 

>They do not know who holds up stimulus.

Likely correct, or otherwise think it's justified I'd their side is doing it. 

>I talked to 3 right wing voters today who came over to fuck my mom. All of them are asking when they get $1200 next. None of them know or give a shit to know who's fault it is.

I'm sure that's true of the 3 people you met. I'm not sure what bearing this has in my argument. 

Back to your original point:
>Were discussing mcconnells motivation to pass stimulus.

His motivation would be to provide just enough stimulus and allow other democratic bills though the senate to reduce the fervor of the dem base. 

Also, as you said, he can also take credit for the stimulus with his base even under Biden, because they don't care.

NOT passing the stimulus just makes it more likely that Dems stay motivated in 2022.

‚Äú People we can not stand for this. Get angry and get loud. We have not lost this election. It was a landslide on Election Day which is obvious because Trump will hit 70 million popular vote.

Dude, that shit will eat away your gains so fast to the point where holding and owning stocks would actually be bad for you finances. Imagine the amount of money you would lose from your stocks in the long run. Who was the big brain person that proposed that?

In the Feb crash one or more went bust already and got stealthily bailed out.

You can take a guess at the names by analyizing some currency movements imo.

EURUSD surge during the crash meant that the player dumped dollars. So it's in Europe, likely. Deutsche?SG? I don't know. But you can short estx500 and have them covered I think.

Then there's the pound/USD crashing shortely before the march crash hit a bottom. I think it suffices to say that it's an important english bank with an ugly chart.

Interesting read, Dems do need to figure out its issues, its evident they took a hit with latino/demographics, I do agree with populist ideas/enviromental but its easy for those ideas to be shut down by GOP and label it "socialist" 2018 midterm was big for dems this election i guess the obvious win would for Biden to win. midterm 2022 theres gotta be a dif approach

Is there even a damn bullish case for ACB earnings
of course it did.  NET always pumps because of some strange understanding from MMs about what they actually do and probably retail FOMO too.  Once everybody realizes it's not the next big play it gets sold off.  

I love NET, I think their Internet tools will be a massive part of the web for the next decades.  That said, it's massively overvalued at its current market cap.
Do you really think Trump was any different?
I've made better returns reselling Starbucks Holiday cups than I've made in the market this week, wife called and said she's 'running late at work, at least 30 minutes.' Probably getting fucked by Chad.

The idea is that if the Democrats take control, the potential injection of 3T in the system through fiscal and monetary stimulus will lift stock market to the upside. The injection of cheap liquidity(cash) will make the defensive play less appealing since the risk of other assets going under will be lowered(they can borrow money to stay afloat at cheap rates). It‚Äôs why you saw a 5-10 percent increase in some of these hard hit stocks and a decline in tech on Monday. There are other variables at play like more regulation in tech but the jist of is that liquidity will create a large enough bridge to get these companies to the other side of this pandemic. A blue wave in most circumstances would be bad except this time around, Democrats can load up the elephant gun and save economy.
Watch out for their earnings Monday. Not thinking it‚Äôs a bad long term play. They have pumped into earnings many times to sell off on crap after. They seemed to have moved a lot more than most of the similar ones in that sector.

Yes. I‚Äôve got spreads for January, and I sold shares in 50-100 share blocks as it went up today. I plan to buy back in around 6 or 7 once things cool off, even if it takes until January. CRON is the only Canadian-based weed company I feel is worth actual shares, the rest I keep my exposure limited to the MJ ETF outside of playing APHA earnings occasionally. 

Personally I‚Äôve been transitioning my weed exposure to US-based companies for the last couple years now.

GME calls are far from cheap.  Just yesterday one of the strikes had the highest IV of all options.  Numbnuts.
Gents I need girl advice. I was about to go out with a pretty girl I meant from tinder. First date I had going for me in months. So we talking and thinking about a place to go and she was agreeing to it and everything but then immediately changed her mind once we exchanged instagrams. Why?
My guess is the market is finally over the election. All the volitity and risk associated with the election is winding down which is why money will flow into the markets. There could be another squeeze if biden wins and the markets will focus back on the stimulus package hope. With the senate still in control, they won't have to worry about tax hikes as well. 

Tldr: stonks up after biden wins and stimulus package comes back within reach. Break past 354 to ATH. Regardless who wins, stonks ATH.
Storytime:

Robinhood first told me my maximum withdraw amount per day is $50k.

So i planned on withdrawing 50k per day until i had my account balance to move over to TDA.

On my 2nd day of trying to withdraw 50k, they locked my account so no more trading or withdrawals. To unlock they wanted a bunch of passport / bank info. After providing this they still have my account locked for 60 days.

Long story short there is something called 'The Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS) is a system that facilitates the transfer of securities from one trading account to another at a different brokerage firm or bank'

If i had known this earlier (im an idiot) i would have just done this off the rip, but at least there is some recourse for an cheapass broker that wants to lock up your funds/account. It basically allows TDA to scoop all my shit from RH and tell them to fuck-off for me.


Long story short, puts on Robinhood, and corresponding with idiots via email. I'm retarded but damn they are something else. Oh and google stuff before you make decisions like i did also helps.
To compare Elon as a man to China's economic power is to compare David to Goliath with China definitely not being David. In comparison Elon would go insolvent within the blink of an eye if Nio was to be expanded with extremely murderous intent to the point where Elon would probably work for Nio. Even the poorest countries usually trump individuals no matter how much money they have in both clout and power. Except for Sealand.
You have Poots?
I don‚Äôt see it on robinhood

My robinhood account value is at -$42,555, this is going to be a relaxing stress free weekend...ü§°üëç

I had over 20 butterflies expire today and I didnt bother to close them early and let robinhood do it. It automatically sold many of the spreads as debit or credit spreads and left at least one leg open on amazon, tesla, and spy. Millions of dollars worth of stocks are being processed and I have absolutely no fucking idea how much money I'm going to have. I know I had 2 TSLA 425/430/435 long put butterflies and tesla ended at like 429.95 or something so I should hopefully not be completely broke. Robinhood did close 2/3rds of those ITM butterflies as credit put spreads leaving a leg open for like 30 minutes. Pretty much everything is fucked but I hope I have at least like 5k left or even 10k.
Never messed with penny stocks until today lol. If I can get 10% next week I'll gladly dip out

If you were inspired by the GME trade seems like you should trade on a special situation or event based strategy with asymmetrical risk. Maybe you have some edge or market expertise and observe some price dislocation somewhere. The elusive 10-20 bagger‚Äî if the trade is high conviction, you can get big on position size and manage risk with a stop loss.

Honestly anyone‚Äôs guess. Organically I see it running at least one day next week with a high between 16-18 but with some good news like we got today it could run another 40-50% in a day up to 20+. Could run all week past that to 30 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I'll buy the dip in the 80's. Can't do mid 90's on DUK.
Ya boi got a raise I make 10.50 an hour now ü§°
Holy Fuck! That expiration date. Buying after a week long rally. 100k. Earnings coming up in a company that hasn't made money in two decades. This is art. I don't know how people this retarded even save up 100k in the first place.
Positions?
This is like retards buying ford stock on robinhood because it's cheap and can only go up.
I didn't finish college myself.

> This bubble when burst will burn their flipping hands clean off (and will probably be caused by them panic selling) 

I think the longer the bubble goes the more interesting it becomes, because the "stocks only go up" mentality will just keep getting stronger. Some people are going to get dumped on and either baghold for years or just cry while they hit that sell button.

I dont think its the top, but to expect the insane rally to continue with weeklies is insanely high risk. I would have done 100k in LEAPS but I'm also a fuckin pussy.

Bet 5k on Biden after this at 2:1 when his odds fell so it was a fantastic bet but the corruption forced me to cashout with only 8k. Would ha e only lost 15k at most in a fair world. Oh well.
I knew :) You are right, but I am OK with the system doing it this way too. I was presented with another case 2 weeks prior, where I have to close the spread straight up or play the simultaneously buying and selling both shares and spreads. That was above my paygrade a little and I saw that I lose about $50 to 80 from the optimal closures.
I have 1150 shares. 500 in my ira brokerage account that doesn‚Äôt have options enabled and 550 on my RH account.

You dont think mgmt would be seen as incompetent for buying back at such an inflated price? I see it as a waste of capital. Just because the $100mm is authorized doesn't mean they have to spend it. They have more important things to focus on at the moment than buying back shares, the march notes being number one. The only reason they did so in the first place is because of Hestia and Permit getting board seats and pushing for it.
Flipping coins. Reading tea leafs. Looking at charts. It's pretty much all the same.

Yea I know what you did I was making fun of myself. Actually the best case scenario woulda been your broker sold ALL 500 shares at like 44x+ something. And then you buy the 10 shares you wanted back even lower (and you of course still get the full premium too).

Jesus. If anything Trump is not only incompetent himself but has surrounded himself with incompetent lawyers. How in God's green did they ever believe what they presented would make it through any court of law. Have they ever lawyered before or is this the first time? Literally a junior high school girl passing notes could have done the same thing. Truly pathetic.

And these "lawyers" are probably making a killing.

Well, one basic lesson, very often, if a stock has just jumped a large amount overnight (10% or more). It will very often drop back down a bit that day. So if you have reason to believe it's going to keep going up, wait till later in the day to buy.
But other times you don't dog, you good.

The time value you are purchasing would make more sense for you to just buy shares. The delta on these will be so shit as well where you wouldnt see the price change in the options unless there are gigantic moves or the contract gets within like 5-6 months of exp. Its not completely retarded but will the return be more than the return you could have gotten elsewhere for the next 3 years?

If it was someone else, would love to have him join our clan.

Just because I dont have 10k to meet my banks minimum investment deposit doesnt mean I'm not a big boy trader.

I'll have you know my account might be 3 figures by the end of 2021 if the markets keep pace.
I love TA, take NIO for example. We have a parabolic curve pattern appearing, along with a symmetrical triangle printed today. Extremely bullish, but caution, parabolic curves can drop off extremely fast. I think we are only on the third stop, but we have definitely more than a 50% ascension from the beginning. I think it‚Äôll run up until earnings (excellent consolidation today with floor of iron) , where they will definitely smash them but speculation will catch up at that point with valuation and we may see a drop off after that point
Uber Eats and Grubhub which show the delivery growth has continued into q3 and will continue so into q4. 
 
We posted .10 eps last quarter, no reason we can't come close to that again or beat it (im accounting for the hurricanes otherwise it would be a big beat). 
 
anywhere in the .05-.10 range would still be a huge beat based on expectations and the current price level.

Well I was hoping to look at the earnings plays first before making that decision but I probably would do a SPY 2\~3% OTM 11/11 C if I can't find one that would be as close as possible to 1000 since it obviously can't be exact every time.

That's funny...anytime my dad says he bought something he tells me to get puts.
News from the sun or some shit tabloid came out that he was resigning because of parkinsons and he was aging. Basically fake news and now putin is damage controlling

Smart. Who knows what Monday will bring? The market can go down just as fast as it went up this week.
It is, its a typical virus.   Just in science talk, you can't say it gives you long term immunity until long term has passed.  Everyone * speculates  * with high confidence you'll have long term immunity like any other respiratory virus.  

Antibodies doesn't really matter either.  It takes like 2 weeks to develop the " blueprint" for the correct antibodies.   Physically producing the antibodies happens at a rate of like 1000/ cell / second.  Once you get the correct b-cell ( blue print)  you'll ramp up antibodies fast on reinfection and not even notice it if you got sick again.

You are exactly the kind of person who drives the destruction of the republic by justifying those who eat away at the process. You'll use technicalities to hand wave away constitutional processes. You further justify it by imagining the other side would do the same, like every athlete who uses steroids. The spirit and guiding intent of the founding fathers means nothing to you. Party of fucking law and order, you can eat my whole ass.

You think qcom earnings was priced in before earnings? Pretty certain nio wont sell off , and go up 10%
They turned a profit last earnings release, and beat their guidance. High chance they will release a new guidance for q4, which will most likely increase shareprice
I think 13.50-13.75 is good buying area.. think EOY has room to 17-20 before major pullback...
Cash out from the casino, buy yourself something nice, and never look at trading again.

It's odd to me that the stock market isn't cratering. Usually traders throw a fit when the government isn't doing what they want. Gapping up three days in a row was surprising.

It's almost like they were so busy celebrating gridlock that they forgot true gridlock also means no stimmy

I recently started trading stoinks primarily and just putting up more cash with each trade to get a risk/reward similar to calls. Before i would put $2K into a call looking for $1K profit, or +50%. Now i‚Äôll just put $20K into shares and sell at +5%. Way less stressful this way

ACB earnings in the AM. There are some posting among us who are already dead.
Well that's exactly it. Tesla, Nio, Xpev, Gme, and others have actually all been "called" here before. In fact that was one of the most interesting things about this particular overview that I did. Remember that these were the most popular stocks so in turn these weren't stocks that were obscure, hard to know, hard to find, unspoken, or otherwise which is what is interesting me so much in the idea. 

The fact of the matter is that exuberance seems extremely high so indices that track these, contain these, or the securities themselves are almost pouring themselves out to the public. I made money on NIO for instance today and bet on it yesterday long after the run-up and still doubled in pre $42. It's just basically a lot of signaling in this market appears to be very transparent because you're correct that in the normal play of the game signals are usually harder to understand or garbled and nonsensical where things don't generally flow in one single way.
120 years of evidence says fuck you

Python to start, use a notebook based learning tool (I'm liking nbdev and Jupyter), learn the workflow of a real programmer from Twitch or so. Learn to work with CLI and why it's appealing. Build a small project to get to know what's what.

Formally all you need is some problem solving skills, ability to look up information (google), and then leetcode to land the interview. Maybe if you're completely out of industry you need a boot camp to get interviews. They're worthwhile if you know you'll like programming enough to do it as a job

No idea, I‚Äôd be fine where it‚Äôs at now tbh, but I think it will rise with released earnings. Some funds simply will not invest in a company until they have a full view of the fundamentals.

I‚Äôm more a believer of the tech and the people behind the company. I went 90%long/10% calls. Obviously the calls represent a larger percentage now. 

I‚Äôm most interested to see where this company is in 5-6 years. 

I just thought the pricing at $9.35 was silly and that $10 calls were a no brainer as more people woke up to what this company actually is.

That being said, I think next Friday that below $16 would be a surprise, above $20 might be a stretch.
Got it. So it feels pretty damn good!
Yea in 1 min.

Lol that shit was funny. Maybe you need to just be happy and stop hating yourself
Yep. I'm extremely bullish on PLTR for both the short and long run, but those are definitely two different phases. The lockup on the other 80% of insider shares ends some time in December (it's 90 days after listing so whatever that is, I believe). Insiders won't sell all of their shares of course but it will likely drop a good deal from whatever high it makes on this run before continuing its mission to the Andromeda galaxy. Worth noting though that this run is due to the announcement of new government partnerships outside the US to handle covid bullshit, so it could just fuckin' run until December.

No shit, because then you would have said "I'm not leaving." 

Instead, you said "I wouldn't leave either."

Meaning, if you WERE president, you would not leave either. 

Meaning you're endorsing the opposition of Democracy.
Now sell it all, and go all in. Cmon.

Approximately $10k.

Mainly shares, 11 rocket calls (unrealized), 2 Raytheon calls I took profit on.

Good week. Think I‚Äôll go for sushi tonight.

Also sold a google call for $11k profit last Friday. About 25k if you let me include Friday last week.
Pelosi told democrats that they can't go too far left in the public comments because they need the votes in the Georgia runoffs.  Democrats who are super far left are not happy.

I personally was never super on RKT- I bought spreads because I got on the meme train and their fundamentals looked good. That being said, I think they‚Äôll beat and have good guidance. I have 25/30 spreads and some similar spreads for March. Down bigly. I‚Äôm not following the warrants too closely, they seem fairly priced from what I can tell.

PS1 and PS2 tend to be better on an emulator anyways for the higher resolution. But if you have to buy one, PS2 probably has the strongest library. PS1 has the most nostalgia value for me, but those early 3D games have aged horribly in terms of visuals and gameplay. It has some absolute classics though like Castlevania SotN, FF 7, and Ridge Racer 4.

Risky. I work in the field and its not clear to me how they're going to monetize this. The phase III for psilocybin is looking at a single dose assisted psychotherapy model. Many barriers - DEA schedule status, training commitment, payer coverage, competition from big pharma who are already working on psychedelic derivatives, emerging alternatives like esketamine which are going for same indication (treatment resistant depression). 

But, has retard meme potential. I'm keeping an eye on it.

Good timing. I bought in the morning and mid-day.
I was thinking about this too and I was trying to figure out which method is best because if you risk less you stay in the account longer but at the same time you run more rolls of the dice and the more rolls you take the lower your odds of success due to reversion to the mean in theory. Not that I understand it all well enough to put it into a sound paper or anything but basically I thought you would do better trying to make large bets than you would small bets. I think there was a GME guy here who bet 100k into options of some sort that I read about lurking and he is part of the reason why I got to thinking about it. In one trade he became a millionaire and the risk level for that trade was much lower than anything I'd have ever seen because the stock was at the bottom and the odds of failure were pretty low insofar as it going against him though odds of it going in his favor was high. While I don't understand video game consoles well I guess he would have won that bet no matter what so it was a good bet.

In a sense thats where I am coming from I think where larger bets with more researched and certain outcomes would do better than smaller bets even if the same research is applied simply based on the number of bets total. I guess it just seems counterintuitive to do.

That is the video I think I got it from at about an hour in. It's from a professor at the University of California Irvine who discusses flipping a coin risking very little versus flipping a coin risking everything and offers the mathematical proof that you are better off risking everything upfront than you are risking very little over time.

you asked how vote spoofing can be prevented. i'm telling you how they do it in california, as relayed by my sister's personal experience.

now, i will admit that opting in for email notifications is necessary (its not by default). but it provides a layer of security so that if someone tries to spoof your vote you will become aware of it. also gives you reassurance that your valid vote was received in good order.

anyway that's *one* way to catch someone dropping something in a mailbox.

It‚Äôs okay dude I held my GDX calls even tho I coulda exited for hella good profit, sold at a loss, jumped into PTON at the top, day traded for a loss there, jumped into VXX calls cuz I thought with how red it was going ez money and day traded those for a loss. This entire process took 10 minutes and I was down 30%

It honestly depends on how bad the supply deficit is.  Is supply way less than last console drop because of covid?  Probably a net negative. Is the supply around the same as last console launch, but way below the demand because demand is obscene and ramping up supply during covid wasn't feasible?  Bullish.

Keep in mind that Sony said the preorders for the PS5 in the first 12 hours were = to the total sales in the first 12 WEEKS of the ps4.  That is beyond insane.  And given that most places cut off preorders once their allocation ran out, its possible they are fulfilling that first 12 hours worth of orders.  There were some fuckups so its likely not totally the case.  But jesus that demand is unreal.

If there is a serious drop of consoles, but not enough to satiate demand, it will definitely give them a tailwind in the form of used console sales.  It could also mean that once units are dropping in stores and not just via preorder, they see a strong surge in foot traffic in their stores both around release days and for people checking to see if any used units were available.

Oh you dont understand, the roving militia is just ensuring everybody else is obeying the law.  Same thing that happened in kenosha, when people brought guns to a peaceful protest and somehow the only violence was when a MAGA kid killed some black people in self defense.
Like what less than 2% of eligible voting population? This tiny amount of people voted against trump than for Biden come on man thats seriously nothing.

That‚Äôs fucking nothing a couple grains of sand.

Thanks man, good advice.  Actually been doing that and still getting it wrong.  Someone gave me some good perspective though; he‚Äôs thinking we‚Äôre headed for a blow off top scenario then a correction.  It‚Äôs the only way I can justify all the gaps w/o even an attempt to close them.

[deleted]
Are you meaning this as a good or a bad thing? 

\-4¬∞F = -20¬∞C. Temperatures around -20¬∞C are much easier for hospitals/pharmacies/HCPs to attain than those around -80¬∞C. -80¬∞C freezers are super expensive & pretty much only research labs have them (I work in a biology research lab). 

Additionally, infrastructure for shipping/housing products at -20¬∞C is already semi-established across a few couriers, while I'm pretty sure Fedex is the only courier that has a dry ice "cold chain" (which will be required to ship the Pfizer vaccine). However, this doesn't solve things for places that have limited access to dry ice. These problems are further exacerbated by the fact that Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses \~a month apart. Coordinating shipping, storage & administration across the US (especially in rural areas) could be a nightmare. Vaccines from Moderna, NovaVax, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and likely Inovio are also two-part vaccines, but none of them require -80¬∞C shipping/storage, which is better for logistics overall.

All in all, the distribution, storage, and administration of the Pfizer vaccine will likely face significant issues if the freezer problem isn't addressed and solved well before the vaccine is ready for use. I remember seeing that UPS and Fedex were getting some 'freezer farms' ready ([more info](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-03/ups-readies-freezer-farms-to-ship-virus-vaccine-if-we-get-one)) which makes me somewhat hopeful for the distribution of the Pfizer vaccine (ignoring clinical trial pauses). 

Sorry for long (& semi-uncalled for) post, but final side note‚Äîif you are still interested in learning more about the six current COVID-19 vaccine front-runners, I made a spreadsheet to track # doses, shipping temps, storage temps, links to clinical trial page/relevant white papers, & some other general metrics I think are important. I would be happy to share it!

People are watching the count extremely carefully this year as they do every year. There are layers of safeguards and methods for fixing things when they go wrong. If there is something specific to challenge it should be challenged and investigated. But just speculating that maybe something unknown went wrong... that‚Äôs not very useful. 

The only reason we‚Äôre suddenly having this conversation this year as opposed to any other is because of Donnie.
When I take profits from options, I usually deposit immediately into shares.

Dave Einhorn likes to use "dollar per vehicle sold" to evaluate car companies. Look what results he got. Losing to the index 10% a year for almost 10 years. Instead of learning, now he starts to lose 30% a year, more loss coming.

From long term view, Tesla will earn at least $10k per vehicle, and sell hundreds of millions of vehicles. Those who don't understand this should do some real homework, instead of just laughing at it.

Most other car makers will struggle to make any profit from each vehicle. 

If you buy short term options, of course anything could happen, stock market is a wild place. You could win. NKLA went to $93 temporarily even though everyone knows it's a scam.

I talked to a colleague today who knows a little about that industry (he lives in Denmark). Says that they even need to kill their breeding animals. The danish mink industry is the largest in the world and it will most likely never recover from this hasty decision.
Idk had one do my annual furnace tune up today and he ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù left the draft stop locked  after ranting about my fuck trump 2020 magnet on my fridge. Long story short I called his company when he left, told them about my experience which I had recorded the rant audio. They sent a new tech out right away to verify the work and ya dude pointed it out right away. Could have been attempted homicide if he had done it on purpose and we got CO poisoning or if our CO alarms went off. Dude is getting fired and im so glad someone on this sub told me I should probably not trust his work

Shares.... Wrong sub man.
Yeah the weed stocks are pure momentum plays, not long term holds. The more legal it is, the more supply there is & the cheaper it gets. None of these companies are anywhere near profitable.
Biden looking good so now I wonder what role Liz Warren might get. It might cause an initial shock, especially to the banks, but it will be nice to trade without some of the flagrant bullshit like Kodak happening weekly.
Was up 20% more than once this week, instead finished down 17%. Take profit bros
Yeah you're essentially selling someone a potential discount. They think it'll surpass your strike (or it was written for this discount, even if people trade it on premium someone eventually assigns you if it's ITM by expiration).

You'll sell the shares at the strike price. So long as your trade has you in the green to begin with, worst thing that can happen is you sell for profit and miss out on profit.

You can make insanely complex trades, so ya... It's literally a zero percent chance it's a directional play.

It can be a mix of so much shit it's pointless to try to figure out. Like I said, 7 or more leg strategies are done. Unless you can find each individual trade and know they're all part of the same batch, it's stupid.

To commit the scale of voter fraud that would have an effect on the presidential election would require people to steal mail ballots sent out to tens of thousands of homes from different areas throughout a state (as to not be suspicious if it was concentrated to a precinct). Then they would have to research the personal information on those people (which I admit is mostly public) and forger the signatures of those people, which has to match with their state drivers license or ID. If too many people voted for someone different from their party preferences (say a person that voted for Obama Hillary and Kerry voting for trump all of a sudden) that would raise suspicions so you would have to target your mail ballot stealing to mostly moderates or independent voters.

So sure maybe you do all those things but you would have to not only do this in one state since this election there are 3 states that were really close: Wisconsin, Nevada, and Georgia. To make up for the margins now, you would need 4K in Georgia, 30k in Wisconsin, and more than 30k in Nevada. 

Actually. It probably woulda been beneficial for the Trump campaign to organize this kind of thing cause they‚Äôre losing or lost in those states. If anything they shoulda done it themselves and not mentioned anything about voter fraud instead of being sore losers and dragging this election any longer.

I would find a smaller local regional lender or use an actual broker to shop around for you (BofA is not a broker, they are a lender - a broker shops around for you). It ultimately doesn't matter as long as you get a good rate and they're competent and responsive. Your loan will likely be sold multiple times to other servicing companies.

This is true but this also assumes that you never make plays that net more than 100%. You don't reject numbers greater than your target goal so if you played an earnings along the way and did well and got a boost of several hundred percent that also works in your favor. It is unlikely to get exactly 10 simply because it is unlikely to get exactly 100% no matter what.

Elon has stated numerous of times that his main goal has been to get the automobile industry to renewable energy.  Unfortunately, Tesla has set the precident with amazing marketing, name, and active social CEO...but don't get it twisted.  Ford was the first with the manufacturing industry of vehicles and look at them now.  As for technology, Tesla has gone a different route with autonomous driving and they still aren't there yet.  Waymo is the only car that has has a license to transport passengers without a driver behind the wheel.

Nio is a staple to China, with BaaS the only ev vehicle to have a government tax incentive.  Given they went with BaaS route, and given the mass amount of people that don't have. Garage or house to plug their car in at night, this will be a long lasting service IMO.  

Soon will be in Europe and now that Biden looks to be winning the election, NIO should enter the US market in the future as well. 

However, if or when Tesla can truly create a fully autonomous vehicle and have robotaxis all over.. they will crush the market as I see them offering a subscription service for robotaxis and you'll just simply schedule your ride pick up times and drop off locations from your phone.

I admit I would probably start getting nervous at the 64k level (6th) and have a hard time keeping to the plan. I can't even imagine having 500k today let alone 500k as a bet. Well I can't even imagine that with 256k. 

But what I want to say is that deals that double your money seem to be raining from the sky. I did an analysis of the past four months and even in September assuming you bought puts you made the marks and there were hundreds of these opportunities. On top of that of course there were opportunities where you made more than 100% which would of course be optimal but fundamentally that's why I asked if it is harder in this market since the market is now giving it out almost for free. In June across the most popular stocks there were over 1,340 opportunities to double your money in a single day using 30\~45dte.
Eh there are so many tiers I‚Äôm not sure it makes sense as a question, but maybe around 80k in much of the country, 130k in big cities?

Fair enough. So the real answer to your original question is, how would that work? Voter ID seems like a good idea, but many people don‚Äôt have ID, because it‚Äôs simply not required by law. Millions of people in this country don‚Äôt have an ID (https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2018/12/fact-check-do-millions-of-americans-not-have-government-photo-id/). Lots of reasons, but lots of people simply don‚Äôt have the papers to get one, where do they go from there? You‚Äôd be disenfranchising millions of people from voting by requiring ID. You may say the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but that‚Äôs simply not how law works when it comes to civil rights.

You could put all votes into a database so that people can check their vote. But most people just won‚Äôt do it, it won‚Äôt catch much and it‚Äôs a target for more hacks. This would honestly probably be the easiest option though, but many state laws would probably prohibit this. 

What other options are there? Unlikely that we see mail in voting on this scale again, but the pandemic necessitated it. People might think it‚Äôs an evil, but if it is, it was a necessary evil. Health risk shouldn‚Äôt be required for voting, it just shouldn‚Äôt. 

Lastly, we have poll watchers, they‚Äôre legal. And several other people are employed solely to identify voter fraud, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to get away with (I‚Äôll concede it would‚Äôve been easier this year) but the consequences are so dire that it would be incredibly difficult to get that many competent people that could actually pull it off to participate AND have no one whistleblow.

There's nothing wrong with saving and waiting since you're young. And nothing wrong with having that equity in your home.

There is some wild stuff happening right now and it could easily burst sending home prices down. PMI is also dirt cheap right now, especially with good credit.

Maiden? What is this 17th century europe? Also social? Like my Facebook?
Exactly
How is 80K not enough? That‚Äôs well within your 20% down payment range, closing costs, and even partial furnishing. Besides nobody puts down 20% anymore there‚Äôs tons of tax incentives for first time home buyers too. Stop worrying, go buy!
Buying in first thing monday
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hitting 30 and I‚Äôm definitely not holding through earnings. I bought 22$ and 23$ calls last week when it was lower. Hoping to sell Tuesday if/when it hits 24-25$.
I'm doing great,  actually.  I'm enjoying the schadenfreude.
Indeed, but so much is ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù. Most calls are honestly too expensive, and IV crush will be brutal.

Preferable market hedge would be VXX or UVXY calls, at the money, 01/2021.

Y tho
what were your positions
Hopefully
It's nowhere near half going to principal with initial payments even if you put 20% down. You need to do the math and look at 5% vs 10% vs 20% down and the amoritization table. Wouldn't you rather have liquid cash or investments if something comes up, vs having to sell your house to raise capital in an unknown future housing market?

I think people are underestimating how much damage Trump may be doing to the Republican Party right now.

If he convinces even 5-10% of the Republican Party that there was massive voter fraud, ‚Äúa James Bond villian level‚Äù like Karl Rove said was ridiculous to consider, then those 5-10% aren‚Äôt going to vote in 2024, why would they if they think it‚Äôs rigged?

I think we will start seeing a lot more forceful condemnations from major republicans as they realize this and as the election is called more for Biden.

Ideally would like to see $3050 gap fill, but I likely wouldn‚Äôt hold long enough to see it. 

$3150 would net me 200% gains on my $3200P & 150%+ gains on my $3250P, so I‚Äôd be looking at about $78,000 total, so a $50,000 gain.

Naturally, anything along the way is fine as well.

Right but you wouldn't hold the option to expiration anyway. You are seeking to sell it at 100% gain so I assume you wouldn't hold an obvious loser with the intent to watch it fail to turn around? Of course that might be a bad assumption on my part and maybe people here do hold far too long.
Yes would have been a vote to pass it - only 50% voted in favor compared to 55% for Biden. So 5% of Biden supporters voted No on  Prop 114. Precisely my point - I'm curious why that 5% voted against it

I mean 20% isn‚Äôt overly necessary if you guys have great credit. You‚Äôll have to pay mortgage insurance but it shouldn‚Äôt affect your interest rate too much. We just bought a 535,000 house and only paid about 70k down and got a 2.5% rate/2.62% APR

 But I'm assuming Yes was at the top of the measure so I really can't see, unless these people have farm animals or a kid that was personally killed by a wolf, why they'd vote against it.
Very sorry brotha. We‚Äôre all here for you
lol same, when everyone was talking about it

Voter fraud is real and is protected against.  This is why the votes are audited and why the inauguration is several months after the election. 

Do you think nobody fucking thought of this
Street benches is where it‚Äôs at...
Does it still have room to go up?
Not a bad idea. If we get some weakness on Monday, I'd take the early profit. Do you have a target in mind here?
I will
Yes. I agree. Mango is retarded. It‚Äôs not about fucking mango. 

If there is fraud every election why wouldn‚Äôt we have id laws in place bruh.
Stimmy highly unlikely until the senate run-offs. No point negotiating with Mitch if you don't have to late January.

Bruh, there's fraud every election since elections were a thing. Of course we should combat it.  But, *but*, motherfucker started undermining the entire process a long assed time ago.  The subtext was, "if I dont win, it's fraud".  Wait, that wasn't subtext

No. But you would think Grey Wolves would have passed with similar margins - instead plenty of Biden and Hickenlooper voters voted *against* grey wolves
I'm not retard enough to pull out before earning. Imma hold my 10.5C til 11/20

Sure, they protect against fraud all the time and there are procedures for investigating anything that comes up. They should keep doing that as they always do.

But the idea that something is particularly messed up just because Mango can‚Äôt imagine losing (and said for the past few months that he knows the only way he could lose was fraud) that‚Äôs just silly.

I‚Äôve been out for a few years, I‚Äôll admit that. Picked up the torch again 2 weeks ago (at the most turbulent time, granted, but intentionally because of volatility). Earnings are generally always bad immediately following earnings, unless they double expectations. I understand the basic concepts, it‚Äôs just this ‚Äúperpetually gaining‚Äù market that throws me for a loop. Every indicator and fear that would have impacted a pre-Trump market is doing absolutely nothing, and I‚Äôm firmly of the belief that it‚Äôs because Powell is extending the fed with an unlimited buy on securities, and interest rates aren‚Äôt budging. Knowing that, I‚Äôd normally play the smaller news-based market swings. However, no one seems to be phased by them.

Edit:

I know it was similar when Bernanke was behind the curtain, but the people who played the market were maybe much less brazen than they are today.

Are they against Grey Wolves?
When your position is up bigly and no one is mentioning it here. Feels good man.
The idea of going all-in each trade is a bad idea‚Äî do it at first until you reach a pain threshold where a losing trade would devastate you, and then use position sizes of 10-20 pct. For a 20 percent position size‚Äî the math works out, you double your account every 4 successful trades that net 100 pct in a row. Can you hit four doubles in a month (one per week)? Maybe with some skill‚Äî starting with a small balance (1-2k) it would take just under a year to hit a million.

Edit: I have not been able to do this so not preaching from on high. Still trying to develop a system and strategy that suits me and will help me reach my goals.

Does the law of large numbers and expected value apply to small series? I tried to do this mathematically but the skew got me all messed up because it is not a normal distribution and there aren't enough coin flips to be able to do that. I might be mathematically wrong though. Also these bets are strange because they are not double-or-nothing because you don't have to lose 100% of the bet if you are wrong. That's the part I'm trying to figure out as well. I wonder if there already is a formula for this. There probably is.

I‚Äôve hit 2x returns multiple times in the last week... shit I bought JKS calls on Wednesday for 80 bucks a pop and sold them all for 6-900 this morning... thing is, those returns are offset by: bad plays, having stop losses on plays I‚Äôm not confident on, and about five small trades a day I make cuz I‚Äôm bored that almost never do anything significant but easily rack up small losses. So what was my return for the week? 106%. Not that impressive considering all my trades were calls. 

That‚Äôs a good week. Bad week I shed 25%. 

The fact that you‚Äôre even asking this question suggests you probably should stay away from options of any kind. 

Here is your best smooth brain play: buy blue chip dividend stocks. Boring shit that everyone needs. Like so boring you aren‚Äôt even sure what they do... trow, USB, Hormel, General Mills, throw in some MCHI for shits and giggles. 

Now you have a stupid looking portfolio that sparks no joy... and a 3% or so dividend... take that 3 percent, yolo it into dumb shit like leveraged ETFs or NIO. Keep it there for a year. Take it out, put it back into the boring portfolio that impresses none of your other smooth brain friends. Rinse repeat. 

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find: you lose little in opportunity cost for the year. You realistically increase your dividend yield to 4-5%. Over 25 years, should you manage to not die from some random drug fueled gay sex orgy accident or getting distracted while driving, crashing, being lit on fire and going where dumb people go when they die, you can expect 10-20 fold return on the money you invest from your only fans salary. 

Doesn‚Äôt make sense does it? Look at total return from dividend reinvestment in the S&P500 or Altria... notice how much of it comes from dividend reinvestment. Increasing the dividend by 30-40% would exponentially increase that disparity. 

You can repay me for this stellar life advice by not having smooth brain children.
Delusion, the RNC is dead, their base will feel disenfranchised from the loss and also continue to die off.

Shares are better here, they help reduce float and put more pressure on shorts to cover on positive news, which creates a positive feedback loop causing more shorts to close, etc.  The more shares in the hands of us idiots the better.

Where in my post did I suggest there was fraud in THIS election?
I mostly agree with you. Both parties are really shitty and have been for a while. That said, I wouldn't say the Left favors "socialism" or the "Europeanization of America". None of that has ever been shown to be the case, and honestly, your Liberals are to the Right of our Conservatives in Canada.

America needs a competent Centrist third party. Historically, America has been Center-Left like most highly educated countries with rule of law in place. 

Speaking of education, that system needs to be fixed and upgraded big time. People have no ability to think critically anymore.

Shouldn‚Äôt this be the other way around, with 25k OI? If it‚Äôs volume everyone already sold it..
If it‚Äôs going right back into the market at the bottom why does it matter? I‚Äôve never had to rollover my 401k so is there a waiting period before that cut check can be reinvested?

So, I‚Äôm new to trading 

How do you make that kind of determination?  I bought because I saw earnings report was coming up and I know a bunch of people who have refinanced and it was cheap.  Figured it would jump.  Had no idea to where though.
Riddle me this, why did democrats forget to fraud local and congress elections?
I got like 2 free shares of tilray when I signed up for trading 212 and I fucking sold them instantly for Tesla am I fucking retarded??
Check my profile I posted a few days ago.
Why sell calls so close to earnings? Seeing the run up last time
No. It‚Äôs called a one digit typo.
Exactly same here we go
He bought calls not shares like you did.
Yah, I have to keep reminding myself that we‚Äôre in a bear market but I think they all went bankrupt with that election pump.

There‚Äôs some really fire weed companies who would be good buys like jungle boys and cookies if they went public. Never heard of acb.
That‚Äôs the key man. I generally average into a winning play and set a stop loss at 10%
Exactly my point. Why the fuck did u buy puts now when earnings is not here yet
Obviously not but they be salty af 

Wouldn‚Äôt you? You kissed this turds ass for 4 years and now you have to walk it all back

Sorry man that really sucks.

One thing I‚Äôve always avoided is buying puts or vxx calls. As a permabull, it‚Äôs just not in my biology. I thought this election week would see a sell off to 320 after seeing the sentiments around here last week especially Friday. Everyone and their mothers were loading up on puts.

I was led astray. I betrayed my fellow bulls and have paid the price. I may never financially recover this.

My fellow bulls, so not ever go against your Minotaur ancestry. Cherish it and it will guide with a dash of help from China.
Man, y‚Äôall are rookies. Easy $3050 gap fill next week. Even pullback to $3150 is 150% gains.

Not a single person thinks tech can drop next week, and that‚Äôs precisely why it will. Even fewer will actually put money on it. üßê
Man my best friend over dosed and passed away today. Fuck heroin
You have to get in the night before Hidenburg releases their report. If you wake up in the morning and then put the trade. You might catch a green dildo to the face. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs fraud or not that first drop is usually the worst followed by a sideways trade for a while

New blood people you are not familiar with.
My calls agree
Imagine going to the casino and playing slot machines all day to just break even. That‚Äôs what I did today.
This. I thought today would be red for sure. Not holding any options over the weekend.
I bought in to CTIC a couple months ago and then sold after like 10% profit, then it doubled up.  Shit is unpredictable to say the least.  I feel like it's a trade you need inside info on most of the time.
makes sense if you went through Sep & Oct..  just play long and know ATH's are coming

WSB sentiment
Riddle me this and don‚Äôt just down vote me. But how is it so hard to believe that voter fraud isn‚Äôt a thing or isn‚Äôt a possibility we should protect against? Looking at the ballots (at least in Ohio) the information required is name, address, signature and last 4 SSN or drivers license number. 

I KNOW all of that information of mine (along with 20 million others) is in the hands of the Chinese government (thanks OPM hack). We KNOW other governments are trying to interfere in our elections. 

I keep hearing ‚Äúexperts‚Äù say there isn‚Äôt voter fraud but how would you catch someone dropping someting in a mailbox?? It took forever and a lucky fluke to find the unabomber who was dropping bombs in the mailbox‚Äôa. 

Seriously want to hear the other side. This feels like such a no brainer to me.
And JFK.
PLTR, SOLO, EA, LI, BABA, AMD.

No rush but should do it eventually, it's easier to manage. Although you could be mindful that they "sell" your assets and cut you a rollover check. You wouldn't have wanted to rollover at the bottom of March for example

Lindsay Graham once said, "If we nominate Trump, we [the Republican party] will get destroyed, and we will deserve it." I hope Lindsey Graham and the rest of the Republican party reflects on these words.

Hopefully with the fall of Mango, the Republican party can get their shit together once again.

Everyone was pretty bullish this week.. it went red one day lol, and barely red at that
Joe Biden is a babbling old demented man. Just remember you elected this guy libtards.
I don‚Äôt know lol but it went up like 40% in anticipation so it got a big drop ahead of it on Monday
Pretty sure that what JP does with the bond market.
Buy X-COM instead
Fucking idiot. If your FD is more than 0.10 per contract, it's not an FD. The fact you mentioned ITM means it's too expensive to be an FD.
The only times I ever lost money on options so far have been from puts. Being bearish doesn't pay out for me.
Yes! I actually thought about it rather hard. You see if you only took the seed money then your maximum risk is $1000 which is not much and if you are wrong and cut your losses quickly with the same pool you can continue to actually compound within the pool.

If the attempt fails then you can probably make it up and try again without causing yourself too much financial distress. Of course you can start with a smaller pool and it just takes extra steps. If you were to start with a pool of $250 for instance it is 12 instead of 10. Due to the non-linearity I thought rather hard about this as a means of risk management which capital risk and realized damage rather than being continuously in the game. 

I think people lose more money adding to their accounts rather than continuously playing their accounts so they lose 75% of the 1000 and then add 750 more to bring it back up to 1000 but their odds of doing well then are not particularly higher even if the return potential is.
Imagine if he bought idk...two days ago lol
Biden wins. Republicans show their true colors and obviously don‚Äôt give a fuck about their constituents, they sandbag stimmy for 2 weeks but it passes eventually. Weed stocks and PLTR continue to moon all next week. Walmart decides to give free healthcare to all their workers, stock prices doubles by January. Biden croaks by February and President Kamala allows Oregon Washington and California to make a new nation called Jefferson-Cascadia.

Clearly Biden is weak as he never convinced many people to walk away from trump. If anything he just convinced Democrat Hillary haters to actually show up and vote. He didn‚Äôt though bring republicans over like the so called üåä. Kinda a shame means we‚Äôre still in for a fair amount of turmoil.

When did you start trading to believe you know how a "normal market" acts?

If you're making assumptions as to what you believe a normal market reacts to, but haven't actually traded that normal market for years, then you're just guessing. 

The most obvious example is earnings. "earnings up! Stock up! Wtf stock down? This market is crazy. Normal market it wouldn't happen". Except it normally does happen... A lot....

False. I hold simple stonks because I am a simple man.

I don't advocate for calls you nutbar.

And the fact is that pretty much who DID buy calls, is actually rich as fuck effective today.

i'm curious how ITM options are FDs. When you're buying ITM options, they're less volatile. I think of FDs as stuff like Tesla 3500c back in July.

Did you mean the company ITM power or did you mean in the money?

I like how you're set up tbh. I might allocate a smaller % of portfolio for smaller cap shit. If you can spot a nio or palantir early and make like 50% in 6 months you can make some good cash

At that big of a position (personally) Don't ever allocate more than 25-30 on options which it doesn't seem you do

Agreed for the most part! I got in AYX now mainly because AYX was trading below the bottom bollinger band on the 1 month chart, it has usually been a sign it's about to bounce back. Your strategy is conservative and smart, I'm being a bit of a cowboy by trying to strike when the iron is hot. Looks like CTXS is historically fairly cheap but the relatively flat EPS growth compared to most software may be a negative sign. DPZ ran up into earnings a lot and missed earnings but a little so a "sell the news" there makes sense. AYX gave lower earnings guidance for next quarter than expected but im hopeful. 
Brent Bracelin is my favorite analyst right now and his 160PT today on AYX gave me a lot of confidence

Ok so now you‚Äôre throwing around the term of court packing without actually knowing what it means. Trump by definition did not pack the courts. As a matter of fact, the only people advocating for court packing are people on the left. Many democratic politicians have actually called for it.

Also here‚Äôs the actual quote from Trump regarding immigrants:

> They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

So, in context it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs saying some, not all, are rapists. You‚Äôre very much misrepresenting what he said.

Firing people in your administration that publicly criticize you is nothing new under presidents. Obama did this to Gen Mcchristie and others.

He also didn‚Äôt ban Muslims, he temporarily banned immigrants from high risk countries that made up a fraction of the total Muslim population. Something I‚Äôm sure France wishes they had done in retrospect.
Almost like both parties look out for wallstreet.

lol, this rally on ACB is one of the most irrational things I have seen in the markets. This is a company that has recorded decreasing revenue for several quarters now. They needed to do a reverse split to avoid delisting. Their only U.S. asset is a tiny CBD company that does a couple million revenue.

Aphria is the market share leader in Canada, is EBITDA positive, has more cash than ACB. Aphria went up 1% today compared to ACB's 60%. Aphria's U.S. asset is SweetWater Brewery who does nearly 70M revenue. ACB shouldn't be anywhere near Aphria's valuation.

definitely needed that clarification
Look at it this way:

* The longer you stay cash gang, the higher the institutions will move it up without you, because they're waiting for you to finally jump in.

* And even when they crash it the instant you jump in, you did your part by popping the bubble earlier rather than when it was even higher, so less room to fall.

tl;dr Just keep positions small like I'm doing.  Problem solved.
You guys way over emphasize "negative shit".

Almost all of the shit you're focusing on you should just ignore.

A lot of people are trying to time the potential election dip, IMO it‚Äôs a waste of time and money.
Palantir is cheap now and rose only for 2 days, if I had more money I would buy some more.
Even if it dips a little you want to hold it for more than 1 week
When Obama took office.. look at vix drop over his years as president.  If Biden calls out he is a winner....I only see this going south.  I think you're holding bags here.

Ive been to alberta and for what its worth edmonton is a dumpster fire

UofA has a good physics department though
excuse me, can i also have money to burn?
Oh no.
Ok couple things. When you buy a put, the borrow is priced into an American put (it's one of the factors and it's a function of strike). Theta decay has nothing to do with the borrow. The theta decay on puts is significantly higher than any borrow cost. For me on SPY, it's essentially 0 since it's easy to borrow. But even if it was somehing, I'm long tech shares so I collect borrow anyways to offset it (my broker has stock lending program). Theta decay is a result of having "volatility-time" optionality. 

You are right shorting shares requires more capital. That's one of the considerations. I have 6:1 margin so it's not a big hit to me and I wasn't going to use that capital for anything else. If say I bought the 350 next week strike puts and we end up going to 347, I'll make 0 since they cost 3 bucks. However if we go to 347 and I'm short shares I make 600 for my 200 short shares. Maybe I pay 0.10 cents to borrow for a week. That's the difference in theta decay vs borrow.

The real risk is the upside, not the downside. The risk of being short shares is you have no capped loss whereas you do for puts. That's actually the main thing to consider. So if we spike to 353+ I'm gonna lose more from short shares than puts. Also not a hedge. It's a relative value trade. I'm ok with the unlimited upside loss though since most of my portfolio is long.

Good luck to you too though. I'm definitely not a boomer. No boomer would short shares since they would shit their pants.
Lmao fugg that hurt me

Pretty much every single democratic news source denouncing voter fraud. Every one of them says ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù
Yes I really really do. And if I am wrong and next week flops, just hold for the long haul man.

This is not your typical shitty penny stock being pumped and dumped.

All Palantir has to do is convince the market that its the real deal and not some steaming pile of shit.

That's why I keep talking about the founders and their connections. The people running this company are serious players and they will take this company the extra mile.

To quote an appropriate meme, one does not simply walk into the pentagon and pick up billions of dollars worth of national defense contracts. 

There is a reason Palantir was the company that took over GOOGLE'S Project Maven contract.

The longer this stock goes up, the more big players are going to realize that Palantir is a real player in the future of data analytics, AI and machine learning.

Sold a covered tsla call Monday and the assignment is pending. Looks like I'll sell a put next week.
Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again.
Nice
If you tell yourself that you‚Äôll safe at a certain number, you may never reach that number. I did it for a year and if you don‚Äôt become consistent and grounded with a method somewhat soon, you may just run to 0
No options though which sucks.

Liquidity becomes an issue above 100k‚Äî you do not want to be taking positions where your contracts represent a large percentage of the open interest. 

The only underlyings that allow you to trade big size are meme stocks and FAANG where people pile in and 20,000 contracts on a OTM strike happen regularly. 

Also, you can increase your chances for success if you trade weeklies only on the open and close on Thursday and Friday. It significantly increases the risk/reward when premium is so little and theta decay is minor. 

Catch a big move on a meme stock with fresh news on the open or close during these times and you can net 3-5x. The same move earlier in the week is 1-2x at best.

Very easy! Just make calls never puts remember stonks only go up. issue is sometimes you won't get quite double but you will always make profit. Only other issue is that it will take longer than a day.
wtf what brokerage?
What does this even mean?
Very interesting $AAPL IV crush on both calls and puts.  Both Calls and Puts are down today.  

some options on both sides of $TSLA went down, but some puts went up.

Every strike on $AAPL looks to me that both the put and call went down today.

They‚Äôve said that the entire way up every time it dips by like 5 cents. Chicken little ass investors
I hear that. If they don‚Äôt have the education it reasons that they might literally be unable to make sense of what you‚Äôre talking about. So, they either trust you, or they go with what they believe they know. 

If someone was telling me something I previously thought was impossible, and contradicted common sense, was possible I‚Äôd be skeptical too! 

This is a general human problem, not just the individuals you encounter. People, physicists, told Einstein that Special/General Relativity was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù until he made three predictions which were correctly verified by empirical observation. The math had been worked out, but it was the empirical verification that mattered. See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Classical_tests 

Treat statistics to these people like physicists treated General Relativity: predictions and results, or we‚Äôll keep what we know works. So, show them!

Pointing to an election, a class of events where these models are unreliably implemented, will not pass muster. 

My usual strategy is to begin with a reference point from their daily life to ground an otherwise abstract discussion.

You expect it to have anymore life in it next week?
RKT
That‚Äôs literally what 90% of this sub is trying to do.

You can make 50/50 double-or-nothing bets pretty easily. So, your odds of success for making 10 of these in a row is 1 in 1000. So on this sub of over 1 million people, quite a few have probably done exactly this successfully. That‚Äôs where most of the insane gain porn you see on here comes from. However, from an individual‚Äôs perspective, does pursuing that make sense? No, obviously not. The expected value of doing that with $1000 is $100; Ie, on average you‚Äôd see -90% returns.
Is there any better feeling than making a lot of money on stonks going into the weekend? I LOVE MY GAMBLING ADDICTION

5-10% but last week it was a little tough. Too lazy to go in my history but it was the 0.08 ones so I made 88 bucks from them too. Now premiums are incredible though. if the stars align you're looking at .50-.38 at 5% above market price strikes. With 1K shares you're looking at 1K a week in covered calls if you're willing to take on more risk.

I'm holding long term though. I think my best scenario will be making about 100 extra per week writing just to guarantee I keep those notional gains.
I did, I have 6c that dont expire until June tho, I might roll them into a higher strike next week and take some money back

That's actually a pretty spiffy looking card. Now I kinda wish I was still on RH.
Selling shares short mean borrows from the broker so technically a loan you pay interest on. Less that 1% a month usually but I guess if you consider theta decay it's a similar cost. You're right though deep ITM have a delta near 1 so a better straight up market hedge than ATM puts. Shorting 200 shares seems riskier and ties up way more capital than a couple puts. 
I don't know your portfolio or situation so I can't say what you should have done. But personally I would have stuck to puts. Hope it works out for you.

>blah blah personal anecdote.

David Perdue got more votes for Trump - enough Never Trump Republicans voted for Jo Jorgenson to influence the election. Cool story bro. I know several down ballot Republicans who can't vote for Trump and voted for Jo instead. Imagine being so pretentious you and a couple of your friends are the sole voting bloc for Jo Jorg. *Grrrr I hate Republicans* - no one cares.
You are so fucking mad lmao
You gotta first keep in mind that a lot of people were fairly surprised with how poorly the direct listing went.

I think things were getting pretty bullish pre-election when RBC and Morgan Stanley suddenly legitimized them by giving them nice price targets.

Also that famous ARKW etf added a small chunk.

Now with the current bull market and their earnings report coming out, the environment is prime for a run up.

I think the company just needs to be legitimized in the eyes of the market. I think thursday's earnings will set the tone for the next year.

If the earnings goes well on thursday this stock is going to have a pretty rosey future.

If they somehow give us an indication that they will profit soon, the stock will in fact moon and break $20.

On the flip side, if the earnings disappoints big time, you can bet this stock will tank and everyone is going to be back to saying palantir is shit.

Easiest play is to sell on Wednesday.

But I am here for the long run, because I really place heavy heavy importance on the connections and social status of the founders.
ATM credit spreads for earnings are close to 50% payout.  So, guess the direction and win!  Or, go 30-45 days out at .3 delta for a 30% payout on most medium volatility stonks.
NOW LET ME TELL YOU how to save $50 or more on GEICO
even the chapos are celebrating a Biden win‚Äîand anyone who believes joe fucking biden is a communist is absolutely retarded
Noticed how much I was up a minute before close. Gonna exit Monday for sure
I have the same problem with selling early. I started selling in smaller chunks (like 25% of a position) and/or selling covered calls. Most of depends on what downside I think there is and if the stock pays dividends. I have PLTR shares and sold calls. With this big move up I'll lose the shares but I'll still get a 20%+ return. For other shares, the calls expired worthless and I've effectively lowered my basis close to the stock's 52-week lows so it's pretty much all upside at this point.
Bullshit! I‚Äôm holding AAPL till I die!
No joke, some UK Chad yolo'd the largest ever on a political bet that Trump would win. 

TBH I would bet on some funny shit if it was legal/ I could justify it, like the death of the Queen of England, 2204 in the summer.
Holy shit that sucks

This is why the lottery is huge for poor people and not wealthy people. Someone with a nice savings can see right through the lottery ticket as a waste. Just owning $100k in a stock that grows 3% is $3k. It works for them. This year even with all the dips SPY is up 14%, or 14k for that large account. 

The wendys worker might have the same shares but only $1k and it grows a whopping $140 that year. 

Even if it's "wrong" or misguided of the wendys employee to yolo instead of safe returns, it almost makes no sense. That amount of growth won't really change their life at all. Meanwhile a surprise 10 bagger could be life changing and help them move up in the world or maybe just cover rent for the next 6 months or something.
Not selling? Absolutely. I have lost 6k more since this post. Just hoping the SEC or someone steps in and pulls the veil off this bitch before I take one last dick pic and hang myself
Im down 20k today and feel sick to my stomach.

Bruh, how do you hold on to those options without knowing that they have earnings on Monday?

Yeah, it's already been done.
for me it was CTXS and DPZ a while back and then again with Winnibago. They all had AMAZING ER's and dumped HARD for days to come afterwards. at the very least you should wait until the next green morning and buy in if you see the stock still rising.
look at the 20 year chart. stocks always go up.  just diversify and be patient and its almost impossible to lose money. i stay away from puts. imo they much harder to make money with than calls.

I was just reminding folks that BJ has earnings coming up and the options are finally starting to move. It‚Äôs been trading sideways
The problem is, you can't compete with your day job unless you're gambling stupid amounts of money.

I have a "fun" account with a few thousand that yo-yos like it's going out of style, but I never take money out when it's up because of the feeling "I've put this much effort into this and all I get is a few thousand?"

Meanwhile, if I had taken the same effort and put it into a side project I'd have made more. 

Hell, the company I work for is up over 300% YTD, on the average trading day the value of my equity goes up or down more than my entire RH account is worth.

It only makes sense if I think of it as a fun time waster, it's not really a way to make money at this point.
If it wasn‚Äôt for corona it might have been a lot scarier.
Those people‚Äôs accounts went to zero long ago
68 billy vs 4 trill is a mind boggling difference...shows were priorities are fr fr

If you seriously need someone to explain to you how calls work, you are definitely in the wrong sub
You realize how many people bought calls this week?
Bought Xpeng calls at peak today. Hoping for green Monday.
It‚Äôs not bc of stock splits?
Id expect opening flat and dropping throughout the week. More choppy than anything else. Definitely can't see it pumping.
I bought 3000 PLTR at 9.30, sold for 10.30, bought 2000 shares of NIO for $19 sold for $28. Now my paper handed ass regrets selling.... everyday that passes.... but then I remember, I made some phat gains still... greed has taken over my mind....

Good advice! I've traded AYX on and off for a few months so I know we have strong support at 115 then 105 so I'm comfortable getting in here. Also partly playing the possibility of a dead cat bounce back to 125 on Monday but if it doesn't that's why I chose December expiration, more time to recover. Which 2 stocks that beat and dumped are you talking about? Maybe FB and AAPL last week?
Am I retarded for holding my 40c of ACB hoping some weird shit happens Monday to make it go boom again?

Well cleared the deck for Monday today.  Cleared all my 11/6 calls and puts (lost on SPY calls, cashed out even on DKNG, sold up 250% on NIO when it pumped up 1% this morning, timed it well) and sold my XPEV shares up 25% before it fell this afternoon.  Good timing on that one as well.

Holding 11/20 APPS 46c (was down .5% EOD, fucking RH wouldn't fill my order when it fell 3 points so couldn't average down otherwise I'd be up 20%) and NET 65p 11/13.  

The NET puts are already almost a two bagger.  Going to take profit at open on Monday.  APPS gonna let run.

Its basically a free money glitch.   Since he owns 300 shares of NIO,  he is selling you 3 contracts lets say for 40 dollars and collecting the 40 Dollars premium that NIO will reach 45 Dollars by Friday.   If NIO hits 45,  he gets to sell his shares for 45 Dollars and also keep your premium.   If it doesn't, he can keep you FD and tell you to fuck off with your gamble.   Stop buying calls and puts and join the other side
Now that everyone is in NIO you guys are fucked. This is like last week when everyone including a ton of institutions got into puts to hedge for the election.

If we‚Äôre still on this upward momentum, then the bull run will continue irrespective of what happens in January. With every passing weak the market becomes numb to the news cycle. This bull run will be fueled by money on the sidelines and companies continuing to beat the low expectations set in Q2. After the warning shot of the vaccine approval is annouced, we‚Äôre looking to a multi year bull run in part due to the liquidity pumped into the system already. IMO

Personally I don‚Äôt mind playing in pump and dumps, as long as you time it right. With biotech it‚Äôs usually cyclical. Thought I timed the bottom at $3 but it‚Äôs bled to 2.40

No. Just for me to lose money. But I do enjoy the idea of making money. But also yes, hopefully next week is the squeeze
can you even do that out of prison?
This is such an underrated development. Even Lindsey Graham likes Biden's personality.

"Great, drumpf is done, gonna kill himself like hitler"  

Him: "Yes it's great, all the authoritarians like erdogan, bolsonaro, they are all fucked"

  

True story. The cunts like orban don't have the cover any more
NIO looking rough
Alright I exaggerate, but seriously. Went up 10x in value instead of 11x. Not exactly a drop to what could be described as ‚Äúfair market price‚Äù at least not for a minute. It‚Äôs all a floozie anyway so pretending that this shit supposed to make sense all the time is self deception
But not buying calls during a historic run *was* dumb

I can see GOP already starting to distance themselves. But it's the fanboys I'm betting on. I'm in California but my friends in Florida, indiana are already stocking ammo. Reports of ammo running out in smaller counties. Let's see. VIX might jump here and there in next 30 days. Wasn't a bad price as 26 is a good base for VIX in recent history.
I like to use the r/coronavirus sub active user count as an indication of how important covid is to people right now. 20k usually means something bad happened, 15k is the mean, and 10k is when it‚Äôs low but going to rise to 15k because of minks or something.
Yes mostly. Yolo‚Äôd 11/6 $5 calls Wednesday night and then moved into $6 calls and a few others and took profit around $9 this morning
Holding APHA shares and calls. YOLO calls and Canopy, but canopy is hedged with puts and all are long dated.  Cashed out everything else over the course of the day.  All of it could go to zero and I would still be up on weed stocks for the month.
Anyone with indicators knew it was really oversold into the election. When the sky is falling on WSB, buy calls!

Selling NIO 60c weeklies is free money. Wish I have a few thousand shares.
Wait I'm confused? I don't pay interest for shorting SPY. You realize shorting 200 shares is the equivalent of being long 2 deep ITM puts right? Being long 2 ATM puts is strictly less risk than shorting 200 shares...

I had calls before earnings. I sold those after earnings.

Then I bought puts on the same day because they were discounted due to the market being super-green all day.

Sometime in the next couple of weeks we will have a red day. That is the day I sell my Puts and buy some calls.

If the market is euphoric, always buy some puts dated 1+ month out.

If the market is deep red, always buy some calls dated 1+ month out.

I see a lot of people here trying to chase stocks that are being pumped like NIO and ACB. 

If you weren't holding before the pump, it's not likely that you will catch it in time.

Options strategy 1: CALLS ALKS

ALKS 3831 - schitzophrenia and biponal disorder managment drug with considerably less weight gain effect.

Maket dominated by generics. Will this USP be enough to create a need?

"Drug-induced weight gain has been identified as a major risk factor for various medical disorders that might be responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality rates of patients suffering from schizophrenia."

At an average price of Zyprexa is 5000 per patient per year and 8.4m potential patients in the US only, with 4% market penetration, revenues are estimated to be around 1.5bn, increasing revenue two fold over time.

FDA meets for PDUFA (approval decision) 11/15/2020. Buy order must be placed by then.

Market seems not to be aware of current potential. Stock is currently flatlining.

Increased weight gain effectiveness vs market leader Zyprexa clear and substantial within clinical trial.

Less side effects (adverse effects) across the board (deadly, discontinuarion, serious, passive) experienced than main competitor. Marginal difference, but still safer. The main ones are weight gain, fatigue, and somnolence.

Lack of compatibility with opioids poses approval risk. Deadly combination. Most of the AdComm panel said labelling could be a solution while a select few were not as trusting. The AdComm panel votes Yay 11-4 Nay votes.

Zyprexa non generic still makes around 3bn in sales per year. If this is anything to go by and pricing is at a similar level, ALKS 3831 with its better safety and reduced symptoms could be enough to kill Zyprexa and gain most, if not all of its maket share. This is assuming none of the generic buyers go for ADXL 3831

Conclusion: Clear opportunity, market hasnt reacted yet. Increased safety makes aproval almost certain. Buy calls between 11/9/2020 and 11/13/2020 OTM, preferably at a strike of 17$ or 18$. Expiry 20Nov2020. Market may not react until after confirmation, if increased safety net is wanted, buy 18Dec2020 Expiry with a higher strike.
Tbf it sold off quite a bit last week, implied herd mentality

This needs serious upvotes. Without fact checking, is ANY state finished with vote counting? Like 100%?
Yeah I dumped 4 of 6 calls and made roughly 130% on them. Letting rest ride

Nio call holders upvote
This is the 3rd time I reached an ATH but unlike the previous two times if we go down hopefully I only drop like 20k rather than 40k, which happened early September and October. Last two times I dropped like 40k in ~2 weeks before making back like 60k but I'll rather be more consistent now.

I'm definitely way more hesitant to keep buying calls at these levels since I learned my lesson.
They are fine if they didn‚Äôt buy weeklies
You say trump ballots get burned, what evidence do you have to back that up?

Right, you don't have any, now run back to your fat mango you little bitch.

Flair checks out. üêª Brotherhood!!
Ofcourse it will change next week, and then you reassess and see what the computers did next week etc..

But what I don't feel like picturing for you, is all the expiration and what they look like, that is only Januarys options, wait till you see the others.. etc..
I see it as people are concerned about or responding to the implementation, not the math. Obviously the implementation was not consistent with the theory and abstract methodology. It reasons that people could say ‚Äúthe whole method is trash‚Äù because they are unable to differentiate the abstract method from their observation of the inconsistent implementation. 

I seriously doubt their minds can‚Äôt grapple with it, but they just don‚Äôt understand the presentation in raw numerical form or with those particular words. Or maybe they aren‚Äôt capable of articulating it that way. By analogy, pro soccer players‚Äô ‚Äúminds just can‚Äôt grapple with‚Äù the complex differential equations apparently calculated by their bodies to produce incredible spin states in the balls they shoot, but their bodies self-evidently *do.*
Basically. If there‚Äôs anything left if there on Monday, I‚Äôll do something else dumb with it like some of these retards. I fully expect to wake up to worthless options Monday morning lol.
Assuming it expires with Max gains, yes very easily. I used to open spreads for 1.50 that had potential gains of 200-300. I never liked holding spreads to expiry tho a day or two before and you can net 70-80% gains easily

In other words, you‚Äôre a libertarian that was too lazy to vote for Jorgensen
It was definitely risky. Best case scenario was 5/5/ amendments passing plus Biden and I can't believe the best case scenario is what we got. ACB doesn't make sense to me as much because they're Canadian and they have no presence in the US I think so I feel like that ticker is all speculation. I like GRWG because it's headquarters are in Denver and it already has a nationwide presence. And they don't sell weed they sell the manufacturing supplies which I like better because dispensaries have a lot of competition everywhere they're legal

Pfizer is still shooting for emergency use in late November and really just the fact that Covid was always a political tool used by both sides. Media has a short term memory and will want you to forget about it. Don‚Äôt believe me? Check in 2 months and the headlines will be hyper focused on Trump leaving office and how we survived the dark winter. Covid is definitely real. At the end of the day though it caught everyone off guard and the best we can do is just really live with it. Many knocked meadows for saying that, but really at the end of the day what is Biden gonna do differently? Mandate masks? Mandatory lockdowns? Maybe that will happen, however a number of countries have done so and are still dealing with it. We don‚Äôt want to admit it, but Covid is ingrained literally in our society much more than we‚Äôd like to think. 

TLDR, trump out of office, Biden in. Covid will be forgotten. Moon mission into 2021
True, I have been away from r/investing for so long I forgot that not everyone who does options cares about risk.. at all
I think I just got cancer.
There is no way to compensate for something like that though. Any kind of bailout is inherently unfair.
best comment I've seen all day. I've been into the sector since the March crash, and the best companies aren't even listed on major exchanges. My entire Roth is in the weed sector (mostly MSOs, companies not the ticker), but I wouldn't touch ACB or TLRY with a ten foot pole. Today hurts my "trader psyche" for missing out on the hype, but I can sleep knowing the fundamentals aren't there. I welcome the new bag holders.

Yeah it was a dumb move haha, I just like spreads a lot and noticed the range.

I'd call you pretty ballsy too though, the triple top doesn't freak you out? I'm no üåà üêª but to me it feels super overextended after this week and it's right at the trend line. I think you're right on the pullback, but I'd be afraid of it happening right here. Even if it does break through its still got ATH to retest

What's the Sharpe ratio on this?
You're not in Australia dumbass.

No ... don‚Äôt like it lol
Likely not. I'm betting the amount of money doesn't amount to much either. Definitely less than half a mil.

Because it went up way to far and too fast. It closed at $56 two days ago. Up $10 in that time is still decent

Maybe, maybe not but POTUS can‚Äôt do much to influence the price. He can‚Äôt even raise the fuel excise tax without the Senate and if Mitch Mcconell is still running it, there‚Äôs FA chance of that happening. Demand and supply of oil and gas plus the associated futures contracts are the main drivers. WTI crude July 2021 is trading at $40 rn. In April 2020 it was -$40 or some crazy negative close to that. You can def get some bargain price oil stocks rn but u could be waiting a while for gains - demand for oil will continue to be low until the pandemic is over and all travel restrictions are lifted.
Math is hard man!
Remember the vix options are European style, can‚Äôt exercise early
Yes please!
Yeah that‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs a pump
Not under republican senate
Cheeeeeese
‚ÄúTo know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself -- that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.‚Äù

Capped gains, and it‚Äôs a bit slower than people like on here. Personally think smaller accounts should use them tbh you might make only 200-300$ a week but you can start with 500$ or so

NET doesn't move fast. Any major movements and they sell off and trade fairly flat while consolidating.

They are known as a "fully priced in" until their earnings no longer supports the fundamentals. For now they still have which is starting to change. But I am still up 80% on 300x shares so I will continue to hold more to gain in the next 1-2 years with expanding market share and product offerings.

If you are holding shares you are fine, if you are holding options wait for a little jump back to $68 and look at selling

Plus i'm pretty certain everyone smartmoney/sellside already knows the numbers are fake and gei, even that mike guy on bloomberg live (who is pretty cool) calls them out for being whack every week for the last three months.
Yeah I guess it generally declines over time, so maybe call spreads when it‚Äôs declining, ours when it spikes, too bad you have to kinda time it before it spikes or you could still lose out on calls
Lol puts print fucking big same as call, you just have to time it right and not be paperhand if the bulls are winning. You think bulls win all the time and get all FOMO, it‚Äôs cause they dont tell you when they lose. Play both sides, dont be a retard and adapt.
It was 50/50, I either win or I lose. I lost, guaranteed to win next time now
cant wait till everyone realizes that ACB, TLRY, CRON, and all the other meme weed stocks are CANADIAN growers that DONT SUPPLY THE UNITED STATES with weed. We have a HUGE surplus of supply of our own. On top of that, theyve already been legalized for a while now, and our new legalization doesnt even affect them.

So when do they take my stocks away from me that I sold covered calls for, it‚Äôs my first time and I‚Äôm nervous
Trump's idea of an illegal ballot is one that doesn't vote for him. Mail ballots, even late arriving ballots are legal according to the letter of the law.

He's be awfully quite about the mail ballots in AZ ü§î

Not yet. You are when you get to $0.
Don‚Äôt be a retard. Take your loss and move on.
Yeah revenue projections based on economic growth, employment, inflation, all of which are economic factors.

I'm well aware the market can be irrational, which is how you get bubbles. People get greedy and keep propping it up until eventually it's gotta correct itself.
If you guys like to gamble (e.g. OTM calls on earnings) you should try buying up big dips in after hours without first researching to see if there‚Äôs a reason for the dip. Just bought a bunch of FTCH at 39.30 we‚Äôll see what happens ü§™

ACB is a horribly ran company that has to implement massive cost cutting measures with 0 inroads to US markets unlike other popular weed stocks. There's a reason why it plummeted in value.

You clearly don‚Äôt understand the business laws that have been changed if you truly believe this. The amount of red tape, excess taxes, extra anti capitalist laws that have been removed to allow US business to flourish has been tremendously helpful. USA became a net exporter of natural gas and oils for the first time in over 60 years under Trump. New trade agreements with Maple boys and Mexico have greatly increased trade and lowered manufacturing cost. Just because you hate Trump doesn‚Äôt mean you can lie and make shot up about him being ‚Äúhorrible for business‚Äù.

Im planning on adding more on any dip. Kind of mad i didnt add more when it dipped below the ipo price

Almost did the same thing but IV scared me off.
Bought 350 puts. Made so much on calls this week I had to lose some money.

Good question. The vix is the fear index and I just am expecting overall fear, not the decline of a certain sector.

Have you made money?

Are you willing to buy calls for a higher price?

If you answer yes then no, sell. If you answer no then no, it‚Äôs up to you, but honestly probably still sell if your stock is volatile from the election. If you answer anything then yes, hold. 

My opinion is sell, but my opinion is also worthless
the problem with student debt relief is taht is is so unfair to people who worked through college and so their student debt was more manageable and paid off student loans early.  Most people swamped with studnet loans moved away to go to college and paid for living expenses and tuition while they were in school.  If we really want student loan debt relief those who worked their asses off should be equally compensated. Those who took it easier in college knew what they were getting into.

Probably smart. We'll see. I partly didn't get puts because though I sold all my ACB positions, I kept my MJs. I want weed to do well.
You were probably lookin' at my penis actually.
I‚Äôm gonna sell FD covered calls probably next week. But will wait for the momentum to really hit. I don‚Äôt want to be called away.

Well see the us legal system is based on us legal precedent. So when Pennsylvania Supreme Court rules that lockdowns are unconstitutional that has a lot of impact on future legal decisions around similar legal issues. 


In China it‚Äôs against the law to use Facebook. Why would that impact the United States?
Thank god we need a break bro

Hey man don't take it as gospel, I could be wrong and screw myself sorta, got leaps for both.
Whoops, glad I bought the peak since it's since dropped.
I don't know the actual number, but as a company they are not efficient and I would have to assume their profits the last quarter are lackluster compared to the stock price movement.

I have $3k in 7.5p for next week. Up almost 25% but holding through ER on Monday
IV, theta doesnt drop that fast, unless its like weeklyc then could be a combo of both
I have a lot of vacation time left so I was seriously considering flying to DC to watch the post election riots (although in the end Europe-us travel is still banned).

I‚Äôm limited knowledge on crayons but if I had a very large account I would‚Äôve shorted the market at open for weekend uncertainty especially after gapping up all week. That pump at close would‚Äôve put your shorts at a loss therefore triggering your stop-loss (if one was set) and canceling your position only to dump again right after and missing out on gains at open on Monday.
This one probably volatile for a bit
Still hold PLTR calls. Hoping it breaks 15 next week if
Whole video seems suspicious, where the heck was the person filming? In the ceiling? Were they just darkening marks made by pencil which were much too light for the machine to see?

And if it is fraud, who are they trying to help? I love how these get posted assuming its gotta be on one parties side, but what does this on its own prove without more info?

I'm sure it will convince some people that the side opposite them is cheating, but theres not enough here to do more than speculate.
Consider your loss as paying tuition, so you can learn to grow balls next time.

I got 5x $10p exp 11/13. Going to hold through earnings on Monday. Pay the boy
Don't apologize, I had no way of knowing English wasn't your first language :)
There was no short covering like last Friday so there is no spontaneus big green dildo race coming.
I‚Äôm investing into both.
Now that‚Äôs the power move! 

I was wondering about those trump flags, like I think there is some third party making bank off selling those. Lost a real opportunity for a 500% Mark up on a product from China.

Yessir. The question is if it'll be before or after Tuesday
Biden is 77 years old this man is a senile thinking he‚Äôs going to be great for our economy you must be smoking crack Trump on the other hand manipulated this shit and my stocks thank him
This green week is owed entirely to everyone‚Äôs focus being on the election and not COVID. Once it‚Äôs over, we will turn back our attention and realize it‚Äôs skyrocketed out of control, and what do you think is the first thing Biden is going to say? He is going to make controlling COVID his signature move, make a name for himself. 

JPow said economy is on highly treacherous ground if we don‚Äôt get COVID under control. I know you have to scroll down in your news feeds this week to see COVID news but it‚Äôs not under control. 

Monday morning your not going to see an election map on the news, but a red hot corona map.

Wall street expectations for gamestop are bottom of the barrel.  They still think its going bankrupt soon.  Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.

That said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.

This will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.

Talking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.


Finally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.

You want confirmation bias?

I work in real estate. We‚Äôve been getting a surge of millennials looking to relocate to suburban areas due to covid and historically low rates. Millennials love using apps such as zillow redfin and to accommodate them we have been signing them up with rkt mortgages. That shit didnt happen precovid 

Also look at what happened to Z after their earnings

BoomüöÄ
I kept averaging down as it kept dropping. Look for a dip next week as it loses steam
Don‚Äôt cry and say you weren‚Äôt warned about ACB on Monday. And if I‚Äôm wrong you can come back here and slaughter me
I feel bad for the kid who lost all his money this week and most importantly a chunk of his parents money. NEVER gamble with other peoples money. Make sure it‚Äôs yours and that you don‚Äôt gamble something you can‚Äôt live without.

What happens if Biden claims victory this weekend and Donnie turns the retard knob to 11?

It's looking like this "lower highs" triple top could be the greatest sell the news event of all time.

My pf is overall net bullish, but SPX looked shaky as fuck today and anything could happen this weekend.

Is presidential winner a sell the news kinda thing
Yes. Unless vaccine news pops up, no chance is of good news over the weekend. Biden news won‚Äôt pop market hours so no pump there and after election hysteria dies down we will turn around and realize that COVID is now a way bigger threat than I was a couple weeks ago
AAPL and MSFT still have room to run
Trying buying low and selling high. Develop patience, both bears and bulls should be making $$ these last 6 months if you‚Äôre only half retarded.

Good luck man
$55 was the price of the option when I was looking at it and then it skyrocketed to $860 2 days later. I had like $500 left in my account lol.
thank you sir
Honest question, why does nobody in this sub seem to have any alphabet holdings? Of all big tech they seem like the most reasonably priced, haven‚Äôt had the same run up the others had after Covid.

I‚Äôm bullish on tech in general, just surprised at the lack of attention to google.

I agree. I think i try to scalp too much. I gotta stop this scalping addiction.
Me too but I‚Äôm up like 50%, I‚Äôm not trying to brag I really do wanna help. As a student and in business I‚Äôve learned and was taught that long term investments will yield better returns then short term, so practice doing some swings or long term investments it‚Äôs also easier because you can find dd for long term investments but it‚Äôs very hard to find dd for daily trades. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and it‚Äôs prepared me for day trading. Best of luck to you.

Anyone got any good trading groups that they can recommend? Something with like a $200k minimum account or some shit to filter out all the idiots.

I think CVS and Walgreens are going to get a lot of love when this vaccine hits the market via Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazenica, etc. Isn't it almost time that vaccine is finalized? CVS's chart is priced in as they do better on drug sales across America, but Walgreens has not been priced in by the larger players. At least not since the government talked about it in the government link provided.
Man I took a look. I sold all my MJ calls a few days ago up like 10% on them. All woulda been 500%+ had I held lol. I made 2k today doing theta gang but it woulda been 10k if I wasn't such a weak handed idiot.
Weed gang stay strong as we hold our bags over the weekend üëÄüëÄüëÄ
If all your money is gone then I agree with the other commenter. Take the loss and just keep your chin up and work your ass off to make money and STAY AWAY from the stock market. Trust me you‚Äôll feel freedom even though it hurts at the moment. I was down -50k at the start of the week myself so I know how you must feel.
-40k for the week, I‚Äôll return it.
Lol maybe. Took a small speculative position so whatever

> According to the CEO, anytime a terrorist is killed in the world, they were most likely found with palantir's software, and then killed with another piece of software they made.

Yo, terrorism is over. When was the last time we heard anything about ISIS? Nobody is afraid of that shit anymore.
Stocks represent ownership claims on business, which are valued based on their ability to generate revenue, income, and ultimately cashflow. Revenue that it gets from selling goods and services to consumers, which is the economy.

idk what fucking econ class you took.
Nah it's just a bunch of numbers that's boring
Yeah but like an idiot I thought they were Monday AH so I was hoping for a run up Monday and then sell them before close. If its like anything else it'll dump after it beats earnings
I‚Äôd make much more if I just hold them without buying protective puts and selling covered calls
1.4k lol

suppose Biden actually showed interest in making America socialist. He has not, but let‚Äôs say he has for argument‚Äôs sake. 

Now imagine Wall Street - in your eyes you‚Äôve bought these congresspeople fair and square, and you want a return on your investment! As soon as Biden utters the word socialism you‚Äôre gonna call up everyone you own and tell them something like this:

‚ÄúIf you want any campaign money (or if you want your skeletons to remain in the closet) you better get his ass out of office before the next market open.‚Äù

 It‚Äôll be the quickest impeachment and removal from office this country has ever seen.

Edit: -2? That the best you got? Come on y‚Äôall are better than that

Edit two: -9? Ayyyyy that‚Äôs better. Can we do -10 though?

Edit three: We made it! -10! Never did that before. Your politicals are wrong af, but you‚Äôre alright by me.

You didn't think to stop after the first 1k, 5k or 10k loss??
This gonna be most my profit
didn‚Äôt you lose 25k last month too? maybe you need to stay away from puts

I'm jacked but WSB sentiment is puts so its gonna moon Monday
He can buy 100 shares of PLTR for $15 anytime between now and Feb 19th for every 1 contract he bought. You pay a premium for this option. Say he bought this option for $1 per share and bought the minimum 1 contract. He spent $100 to have the option to buy 100 shares PLTR for $15 from now until Feb 19. If the share price goes to $16 or greater he will make money. Alternatively he can sell the option itself if someone wants to pay more than $1 for them.

Stand on your head and you'll turn that right side up!
I think common sense says what goes up that much has to come down *eventually*. But usually common sense is wrong with this market so who fucking knows. NIO $80 EOM or NIO $20 EOM?
12mil on NIO after hours. Nice.
Hahaha fucking spy at the last 5 minutes.. rockets up $1 just to drop $2 lol, then finish at $350 

Idk if that‚Äôs bullish or not, but fucking hilarious regardless
üöÄ go üåí
Yup. And then a drop off after the 17th followed by a gradual upward traction
Odds Biden announced president over the weekend? I have a feeling they are going to still be counting until like Wed next week.

Trump wants to help America.  You brainwashed nerds are too dumb to realize it.  Them democrats don't give a shit about America aka why they been tanking the economy to get him out.  He will most likely just sue a bunch but he doesn't want to hurt America.
I'm with Trump. We must stop this fraud together. MAGA
Very unlikely, theyve done nothing but overspend in Canada. Unless they get results going they don't deserve attention

Are you really excited about this after being up 8% this week?

Lol

All weed stocks shot up today out of hype.
 RemindMe! Monday at 9am
Next week bear r fuk
Yeah, but thinking the russians might have spread fake disinformation on the internet is a pretty cogent assumption no? Plus there wasn't any politician with the same clout as POTUS spreading this information like he is today.

Hilary handled losing much better than the POTUS has. Despite her extreme rhetoric leading up to the election.
*they didn‚Äôt take profits after a 100% rally because its going to be* **200%**

I think it‚Äôs a pretty big step, he isn‚Äôt disavowing trump like dems sure, because that‚Äôd be a horrible move politically with how much support trump brought to the party, but it‚Äôs basically signaling he isn‚Äôt going to incite further division and seize the election. He‚Äôs just an opportunist piece of shit and knows to pick his battles (senate and SC).
Bears get a -.01% day LMAO
I'd say gg but I spent the whole day getting spawn-killed.
Unless u guys are going into the weekend with ACB PUTS, RIP to those holding calls or shares into Monday earnings. You guys are going to get wrecked on that shit stock. ACB is literally one of the worst pot stocks to own. Former 1 year long bagholder right here knows all about how shitty and corrupt they are. Does the name Cam Batley ring a bell? 

Better believe I‚Äôm short on this shit company.
Wait for AH... we‚Äôre probably all about to get fuk‚Äôd

You should not buy TTD puts
Bought calls yesterday, now let's watch it reverse back to 12$
My nio calls plummeted even tho its relatively the same price? Is it IV/Theta?
#ITS FLAT
Finally getting the hang of not going all in on every play like a retard and hedging my long term bullish positions with short term bearish ones. Feels good man.
The day i buy overnight calls i get fucked by a flat day. FUCK
All I see here is opportunity
Show us your calls, pussy

My ban has expired and I can now let you guys know I loaded up to the tits on puts last Friday and when Monday turned into facerip.exe i doubled down.  Portfolio down 50% still holding puts expiring throughout the next month.  Cant bring myself to dump them.  Missed out on best week of the year.  Am i legally retarded?

I got so fucked this week trying to be a bear. Literally sold 5k worth of potential profits for small gains to short tech. Fucking idiot. Autists made 400+% on NIO calls and I‚Äôm coming out of this week $100 higher in the portfolio than where I started on Monday. God I fucking hate it. Never buying puts again unless there‚Äôs momentum to the downside
You could just take profit and get out of debt over time compared to losing it all and still being in debt lol
Needs Chris wray‚Äôs face on the lead agent
Biden has almost installed that cushy hind down on the WH front lawn... Donnie will put up one last show before the fall into oblivion this weekend, one last gift, a pump for all the pumps.

Now, the Dems still have a chance at the Senate come January, can you even imagine the size of the stimulus package dropping from black hawks over everyone's head? It'll be like the second coming.

Look at what happened to the stock market the last time a Democrat got installed at the WH. Trump was good for the bottom line in the same way as a cheap ass cracker stripper can squeeze one happy ending outta your dried ass. 

We're now about to get the full experience, all greased up by the immense machinery behind these Super PACs. One lay to rule them all with the Original Ventriloquist behind Ol' Joe. 

Man, you're about to experience Nirvana one way or another, whether you're a top or a bottom, so better make sure to get that positioning right.
Ok idiot bears had their red day. Reset the green streak counter for Monday.
bruh... CVS earnings were this morning...
Calls on HR visit.
Mmm, touch me daddy. Keep talking.

Pretty crappy he built a factory there and now they probably stole a lot of the tech that goes into the Tesla cars and use it in nio or whatever conmie crap car they build over there. So stupid to even build over there for huge businesses.
i get charged like 10$ for one trade ( buying is one, selling another)

this is bullshit
$2
Who tf knows...
Come to think of it, I got downvoted to death when I said last week that VIX would crash after the elections. It dropped from 40 to 24 in 3 days with more to go next week.
What in the fuck is going on here?

Man, SPOT had a hell of a week. I wish I had bought calls instead of selling put spreads. Oh well, it all spends the same. First solid week I‚Äôve had in awhile. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll lose it all on Monday.

But funny
hold till retirement
Ask yourselves this question: 

**If money thought NIO wasn‚Äôt going to continue to rise, why wouldn‚Äôt we have seen more substantial profit taking today, going into a majorly uncertain weekend?**
How the FUCK is the economy in a better place than pre-pandemic? This fucking market is propped up on BRRRRR and it's gotta face reality eventually, this shit aint right...
Gap up just to make sure the gap down makes it all end flat üôÑ
I got Jan $295 and March $320.

It's called FlowAlgo
Ouch
Too much bearish sentiment here.  Calls it is.
Op is worried he wont get an inheritance lol
Dark pool prints don't impact SPY's price usually.

So, if someone sold $2,000,000,000 of shares, they're likely selling the top if we close notably under the transaction price.
Cannot wait to see AH volume on NIO
Noceeee
OSCAR WORTHY
I'm even worse. I buy SPY LEAP call spreads or short SPY leap put spreads.

Robinhood panic closed my SPY 352 / 353 call credit spreads for an average of 0.10 on that spike up, GG me. Had 130 spreads left. \~= $1000 Robinhood tax.
I sold my call, you‚Äôre right. It was already up anyways so i made a profit. I‚Äôm going to play it by ear next week.
One of my coworkers is a total milf. Thinking about spanking her.
Nah he can't expose that kind of confidential briefing until he is sworn in, he's a man of honour

Surely my account can‚Äôt go any lower than this,

Next day: **goes much lower**
All in on RKT over weekend üöÄüìàüíéüí™üòé
Always buy your spy puts at 3:58

Same boat, my greed has fucked me. I took $700 today in AMZN, could have been $4000. Green is always good.
I have 25k in nio and xpev puts.   If I'm up 100% on shares and 10000% in options. I'm cashing out.  People forgot getting to 50 is another 20% rise

Edit also I'm panicking because of stupid money

You bears may hate me but it ain't no lie,  
Baby buy buy buy
The odds of it not crashing was really high, after the job report I wasn‚Äôt sure until the market open and went directly south so I stacked up on SPY puts!
I fucking hope so so I can recoup half my losses this week..

What are you holding now?
So is this a triple top or not? Crayons guys what do you say?
Can you give his an idea of open contracts, bid-ask spread, and when you bought these?

Thank you
I had that same dream but it went up today
why was this removed by mods?
We holding NIO calls over the weekend?
Loaded up on NIO Mar 60 calls. This is just a consolidation day!!

We‚Äôre all just permanently embarrassed millionaires
Your odds are better than a lot of retards buying the Dec2020 calls at the same strike!
Green on Monday?
i get your point and we'll see, but the turnout for republicans this election was historic as well (most votes ever), so it isn't like trump only turned out democrats and not republicans. the demographic shifts don't favor republicans in georgia and its only going to get worst. in the 2018 midterms, abrams only lost the governorship by 55,000 votes.  not saying dems win 2 senate seats, just saying, its a toss up.  i would agree its most likely republicans win.
[deleted]
I don't know, but I stay the fuck away from buying calls on divident stocks. Share price is super unpredictable and you miss on the key benefit of being a shareholder. Just buy shares if you believe in it.
That‚Äôs what someone that started selling them 5 mins ago would say
My condolences to the bears

I am so happy bois I can finally afford a mattress. Thank you daddy Thiel

I sold but I have a great history of paper handing potential 5 baggers

I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a safe bet.
There are a few ways ive heard of people tricking altos.  But its usually been on a small scale where they just bid down a single option or shares of a low cap stock, that kind of thing. Algos definitely have the advantage because they can see all of the variables at once and can act instantly
Yeah I‚Äôm saying just by the 3M and 1Y chart that thing just climbed a cliff. Can‚Äôt argue the demand for EV in the present & future though so I get it
Idk . I sold all my shares
Price target?
All on black, a man of character
The thing is it picked the wrong time to do an IPO. IT was valued at $40B privately before the IPO and now the market cap is only $22B. Plus they make money during uncertain times (e.g. covid) and have a ton of cash on hand.   


Get in now before the analysis come and the hedge fund heard follows.
Thank you for the award!  I think it's still probably a good play, esp if it expires a little later. Even if MCD did drop, I'd bet on a pretty huge bounce.  GL!

I get it, you hated him 4 years ago and you still hate him now. I've seen a lot of hate thrown his way, but this guy is a consistent winner and an overachiever. That's what the people who support him love about him. Yes there have been some scandals, yes there have been some lies, and maybe a few times he's twisted the truth to make himself look better. He's out there everyday proving those haters wrong time after time. Call it jealously, call it envy, some people just can't handle how successful he is and how much money he has, could even be jealous that he's got a hot foreign model as his wife. You may not have wanted him in this role, but he's there now and there is nothing you or I can do about it. I know its possibly going to get worse over the next several days, but like him or not, Tom Brady is turning things around in Tampa Bay.
Always check VIX before hand. At time VIX already was at peak rally so Everyone who want hedge already was on it and then after no more selling spy hedgers start selling puts. 

Give it 5 more days before selling for profit and start buying puts (again).

If you see 25,000 in volume on a Thursday or before earnings on a strike price that's otm you should probably buy it if the open interest is low
Explain this to me like i'm retarded
Activity isn‚Äôt retail investors - their volume is a pimple on an elephant‚Äôs ass. The institutions needed to wait for more research to be released so they could fulfill their fiduciary duties of due diligence before they invested. Those research reports were just released and now making their way into institutional positions.

Not for Mitch and the GOP Senate.  They get rid of an unhinged Trump while maintaining control of Senate (unless dems get both GA runoffs)
The higher this pumps the more bearish I get. Something‚Äôs not right
It's not about their base, it's about motivating Bidens base. Dem voters are way more likely to come out in force in 2022 if everything is still being fucked by mcconnell than if they have stimulus checks/can pay rent. 

Mcconnell will want to allow Biden to accomplish just enough for people to get complacent in 2022.

Chuck hasn't even been alive the last two seasons.  You must have gotten more out of the show than the feud between Chuck and Jimmy.  It would be difficult not to.  To summarize the entire five seasons with one theme that hasn't even been relevant for 40% of the show seems disingenuous.
ah yes, randomly dropping 'rich people things'. Doesn't come across douchy at all.
Sell my baba calls or hold ?
I've made money off Baba 290-305 calls like 3 or 4 different times since August. I wouldn't be surprised if it dips again due to some CCP shit. I'm holding shares for long term though and will probably continue to buy relatively short term calls on big dips

OOOO SNAP IS PUMPING BEFORE MARKET CLOSE
go look at SPY 180 days EMA, the MACD show it is on it's last leg, dropping next week, bet
I said it pre-election and I'll say it now

Why did the republicans refuse to pass stimulus before election day? This seems like a terrible strategy for them. I know the dems asked for "too much" in their interests, but it doesn't matter.

The republicans had more to lose (and they did). Wtf were they thinking refusing stimulus? This race is so close it really could have been the difference

Lmao, sold my calls because today has been fucked ALL DAY. Bought puts and joined the gay bears. Fucking market goes up.
How much in $
FUBO options people. You heard it here first. I told y'all about PLTR before it happened.
I love how my account automatically closes out my expiring calls an hour before market closes then said calls triple in value during that last hour.... fuckin great!

RKT hasn't moved at all since last earnings. With Z popping, that indicates the RE market is still cooking + refinancing at these rates...
I would expect it to pop after earnings. I've been holding calls since early September, admittedly, I expected it to jump a little harder by now.
I'm only $25K from my ATH now. I'm getting more and more nervous about triple-top rejection. Praying for a gap up weekend to leave resistance behind as ancient history.
News report say if Biden wins that computer coin is going to be $400,000.

You're right. But it's experience everyone should have,  rich, poor, or in between. And I wish life can treat everyone kindly and equally so everyone can live up to their dreams. Sometimes the less hard working among us are they ones who get to experience it, very unfair,  really
I assumed the election was gonna be a blue bath based on all the available data and GOP wouldn't hold the senate, leading to higher taxes... I was wrong.

Maybe but don't count on it. Trump was the single biggest motivator. A normal Republican likely would have won GA and at least AZ. I think the Dems are going to overestimate their support in this election and are in for a surprise when a normal Republican candidate in 2024 wins.

Green Monday prob 360 spy
I used to be a debit spread guy. What is great about credit spreads is you can be wrong and still hit max profit. SPY is 350 now. You can buy call credit spreads for 356/358. So you're bearish, but SPY can still gap up to 355 and you would hit max profit. You obviously won't make as much as debit spread, but your success rate is much higher

Be careful
I have found myself that I do not agree with some of the things that /politics say and same with conservatives. So my political views are a mixture of both.
Apple announced their move away from Intel back in the June event, so we‚Äôve known for a while now. Thing is, Apple make up very little of Intels laptop market in the first place.  Sure it‚Äôs bad for Intel, but Apple are just moving in house, not to AMD which means it‚Äôs lose for both Intel and AMD and a win for Apple. 

Intel seems like it‚Äôs an old timey stock at this point and I don‚Äôt think good or bad news is going to affect it, it‚Äôs just too big of a company.

Bears this is actually ideal. Going green into weekend means more momentum for the fall.

i mean i live here too and there have been a lot of grass roots groups getting minorities to turn out to vote. i agree, we'll see if that translates to the special election, but i think with trump still in office and you know, a pandemic still raging across the country, there should be a decent amount of motivation.
Most of them are in blue counties though. I'd say those will worsen Trump's chances.

Thanks to a bear who bought a QQQ put from me.
Fuck you bears. I tried puts this week and out of 8 tries only 2 hit. Yea they were 100+% returns but I lost it all on the other 6. Literally ending the week 100 bucks higher where I started. Buying calls is much easier. Never again.

So Trump is obviously going to try and cause as much chaos and destruction on his way out and he has more than 2 months still in office.

Is there anything he can do that would have a legitimate, direct impact on the markets?  Can he fire the fed chair?  I'd imagine he'd want the markets to tank so he can point and say, "see the markets hate Biden, stand with me".

So this place isn't where you learn anything, tbh. I'd recommend following some people on YouTube who teach about stock behavior and patterns. Dont listen to anyone giving advice about any specific stocks since their belief and investing plan aren't the same as yours. Just learn about what different things are, like indicators (RSI, MACD for normal stocks) and classic bar chart behaviors that indicate bullish or bearish movements. That way, you can identify what stocks are behaving like that you watch and can make better educated guesses at good times to buy in

You only get burned on big overnight changes. I didn't do anything early this week because of the election. When there are big changes even when volatility isn't expected, you can always just roll out for a credit if possible to the next weekly expiration as SPY has 3 a week and move your strikes up

Well, it depends on your organization, which is the problem that presumably the OP is encountering.

Anyone else think the market is going to tank when we remember COVID after Biden is confirmed? 120k cases yesterday..
Oh no

Buying shit after earnings without being able to liquidate is risky dude. Shit will push up really high and then sell off - pretty much guaranteed 

Hopefully the pop back up towards $70 in the next few weeks though
Stick with Biden-friendly ETFs. There are plenty out there. I'm most heavy in ICLN but there are other good ones. Just look up clean energy ETFs and find one with holdings of companies you like.

Nio has defiantly been a eye opener.

Inverse me.
What that other guy said, and setting a court precedent that the federal government can get involved in the election also opens the door for a democratic congress, presidency, and Supreme Court in the (far off) future to eliminate things like partisan gerrymandering, which is still legal (racial gerrymandering is the only illegal gerrymandering). That type of ruling would now have a way easier time passing as upholding the precedent from a case that Trump wins.

E*TRADE also has instant access after your first deposit. It‚Äôs a better platform than Robinhood for executions but it takes some getting used to.
I know Trump triggers you since he reminds you of your bullies.  But he would be the one to help you.  Biden on the other hand would call you a big titty nerd.  Just look it up Biden makes fun of fatties all the time.  Trump also cares about black people. Biden and Obama use them as props.

SEC requires funds to take 2 days to settle. Anything beyond that is RH playing with your coin, my guy.

If you use unsettled funds you should be able to buy into another position with them but if you exit that position before they settle you are committing a good faith violation. I think you get 3 of those in a month or you get the 90day ban.

Good faith violations can be avoided by using a margin account.

TL;DR- get off robinhood and enable margin, my guy

If I held thru today, I would‚Äôve been up about $2000 on those calls alone. For a minimal investment. Those 5.50c were dirt cheap when I picked them up Tuesday afternoon. It looked like Mango was in the lead late Tuesday night so I dumped them wednesday at open. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

DO NOT DO THIS
I'm from GA. Black voters rarely turn out in large numbers for special or run-off elections. And that's the bulk of the Dem vote. Not saying they won't this time, but with Trump as the biggest motivating factor to vote, I doubt they will in large enough numbers to beat the Republicans

Did they install more solar panels?? Wonder how many lanyards they sold
Anyone talking about HOFV??
Any suggestions? Had my eye on enph but didnt bite after that 12% move yesterday.
Damnit.  I voted for T and was rooting for him to keep the lead, but now made peace with biden getting it.  Now I'm rooting for biden to keep the lead.  Can't do this to me.

Please don't.  Could it make you rich?  Yes.  Is it more likely to lose you money?  Probably.

I think we go up next week, but I don't think we squeeze.  Up to you of course, but I strongly suggest going a few weeks out with any serious amount of money

Hell yah brother. My shares are up 30% and my diaganols almost at max profit ‚úå
Wouldn't libertarians be much more aligned with republicans though? I wouldn't expect that he would get all of the votes but 75%+ seems pretty reasonable. 

"Libertarians favor both personal and economic freedom and oppose most (or all) government intervention in both areas." So they basically want free markets and don't like being told what to do (including wearing masks) which sounds just like Mango and most republicans.
This has to be the worst take I‚Äôve ever seen on a television show. Hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere? What are talking about lol.  The character development has been magical. Jimmy has literally changed characters during the course of the series. We discover the origin of Fring, the whole German engineering plot, and not to mention Kim‚Äôs evolution.  Nacho‚Äôs cartel involvement has been amazing to follow too.
They keep trying to push NIO down but the buying is too strong
I think the key is to look at the bond market. The same hedge funds that are all positioned long on equities are positioned short on the bond market. Banks and the Fed have been eating bonds for forever, and I think hedgies are running out of ammo, so when banks decide to strike and start bidding up bonds, hedge funds will be forced to close their positions in the bond market and they'll flip equities
Election is over, nobody cares about Covid now
literally the best stock in the world for an IRA
Someone give me a weekly play for next week. I have $1k
Xpev has earnings 11/12. And nio 11/27. With the run up and the fact is a pandemic proof stock in China (since they have their shot together) its running up to $50 by eom
wow
Nio 42
Hey, how much you make?
[deleted]
This is the way
How?
Holding options that expire when a stock is halted, now there's a situation I've never considered
Fuck it in sold ü§°
Calls on VIX work?
Ev puts.  Nio is top 10 car maker in world and never made a profit.  At least tesla kind of made money.  Not a lot but something to justify.
Paper-handed pos, gimme my roku calls back!
JPOW buying SPY now?
vxx is cheap
Did you read my book, "The Art of Buying Puts Low and Selling them High"?
Which is why next week is definitely buy week
"Earnings" hype. It's also a stonk. Just sell before earnings.
Aphria as well
Puts don‚Äôt win money indeed
Calls with a $15 strike price and expiring on Feb 19, 2021.

üöÄ is cleared for takeoff
Natty life
Most likely they will be from people who recieved mail in ballots early on but decided to vote in person. Net gain for biden.
Nope, this is how you win big.
Pullback to $35 is actually pretty healthy for the chart long term. Was running WAY too hot this week. Exited calls at $41 and will be back in with leaps at $35.
I sold mine earlier this week and bought calls. They‚Äôre up 246% ü§ô

Yu Mo Gui Gwai Fai Di Zao
PLTR $15 Monday I pray and hope
why would it go up
Maybe, huge seller. We might range a bit but eh idk. Unless they have stellar earnings (I doubt it), I'm not feeling great about it.
Do I get a badge or something?
I sold my call but kept my $240 short put
Latest I think it would happen would be March ER.  Could be any day between now and then though. If we can regain upward momentum as we have today, it'll be sooner rather than later.

Will the AAPL event next week have the same hype as October event?
Yes
I had ACB 15 $6c I bought at $.09 and sold them this morning for a little over $4k. Pissed I didn‚Äôt hold until I hit the $9k mark but I was afraid on loosing on the morning pop.

Congrats on your play.
Tardbros help. Hold my SPY calls over the weekend or sell EOD?
Possible like you OTM FDs might print.
Good buy for next week?

Not yet. Maybe when it gets closer to 100 my leaps will print!

True. 15% was probably too generous but I think there is a small chance of a major split between Republicans.
They have to report on what President Biden is saying and theyve already been reporting what Pelosi is saying

Why not 25? How about 15?
Coty was on my watchlist. Damn

No one cares anymore because Americans are the most entitled selfish assholes on earth. I‚Äôm up 10k this week because I finally realized that
U fool, it always tanks on Fridays. This isn't a tank either, meaning Monday could be red, but we will have liftoff for later in the week
420
Nikola is a scam. But it will also be a free 100% play next week. Just buy EOD and sell before "earnings"
Why the premature thread. Antsy are we?

You may change your tune as more and more of your money gets funneled into socialist programs, capital gains taxes go way up, income taxes go way up etc. The Dems are not economic saints and MAGAs will fade away eventually, especially after Trump dies.

Debating same, but I kinda wanna hold.
Is the guy in here that said TTD would hit $830 today? I wanna talk to him
[deleted]
I lost money on ACB 5.50 calls this week. Yes, you read that correctly....
The reason Tesla hits massive resistance at 377 a share, is because Chinese traders start piling into it at the pre-split price of 1888.88

It's got a fortress of resistance at both 420 and 377 (and 336, pre split 1680). This shit is as solid as a rock.
Cool thanks. Yea I think I will start doing that with pltr. Premiums are low but if I can get $100 a week from that that‚Äôs more money to yolo

I've learned from this especially to let it play out.

I had 200 nio at 26, a ton of 11/20 25c and some 1/15 35c. I sold them all around Oct. 22-29. Yeah I made a profit but how do I feel today? Humbled, educated. Retarded.

AMD has huge potential this month. They‚Äôre releasing a new chip (Nov. 18th) that‚Äôs supposed to blow NVDA‚Äôs chip release out of the water. Possible play for next week.
More likely, elderly trumpers literally just died because masks and social-distancing are a "conspiracy."

Feels like we lost many brethren this week. Comment volume is low.
What the fuck are you talking about, no one but the utmost fucking idiots called a priced in trump victory market. Literally have not heard that once. Go on any website that talked about the election-based market and everyone predicted a blue wave. Even though dems didn‚Äôt get the senate, a biden victory was already anticipated

People who say the market will crash bc of biden are just plain retarded, biden has no control over anything until January. The market favors stability. Now that the market sees a dem victory within its sights, it‚Äôs now favoriting higher chances of a stimulus (which McConnal said he‚Äôd push for by the end of the year)

That being said, the only things that I see could fuck this market is if DonnyT goes apeshit
Amd?
The later is correct.  I would do the same if have the means,  even if it means putting in my last dime, I will do it in heart beat. Lamborghini is more than anyone can imagine.  Inside is breathtaking, feels like you're on a space ship to say the least

Welp don't know what to do. Took profits and sitting on 30% cash.
Yes better gain per % increase of the underlying equity
In general, the american public at large leans slightly left. At least you can see that from Hillary and Biden both winning the popular vote. Republicans know it helps them to suppress the vote. That's why they create challenges to voting, especially in cities which lean blue. 

If Democrats had control and were able to federalize the voting system. They'd likely try to erase barriers to voting. Eliminate the electoral college.
Acb calls for earnings ?
I am satisfied in my suspicion that you had no examples of the Democrats bucking the process. Only a scenario where you baselessly speculate that they would have done the same. Got it.
U know what they say. U can‚Äôt keep a good stock down

It's funny r/conservative thinks on their right side of the history but r/politics says the same. I consider myself a centrist and find it funny that both side accuse each other of same things.

NIO pumping into close is just stupidly beautiful

It's not the counters, its the officials feeding the counters ballots. Pretty easy to not get caught if you can same-day register people and fill out a ballot for them. Not saying its happening but its possible

Wtf was that SPY print
These swings on $SPY are pure autism.
If he called for your personal head on a platter on social media, would you feel the same? Be honest.
Are you going to refund the 3 months of fds people lost following your amazing "dds"
42 is the most important number in the Universe though. It's the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.
And there we go again, VXX hitting new lows, market is gobbling up any bounce instantly.  Nothing to drop it until next year
So if one person lost someone due to Covid and blamed trump, then there is the difference and change

Damn. How much were they? I can't even follow the math here.
Bit late for that don‚Äôt you think? Might as well make money off of it while you still can

And just for the record, they don‚Äôt do the spying, they make big data easier to view, access, and analyse. What anyone does with the now easier to access data is not their problem
Free money
My positions been flat all day, not gonna complain about that, better than having a loss
The fire victims were paid in PCG stock instead of cash as part of the bankruptcy proceedings and civil lawsuit settlement.  In order to avoid a crash in the price they cannot cash in for a certain amount of time (lockout).  I think they can sell in December.  Maybe somebody is betting or hedging price movement coinciding with fire victims selling shares.
Have you all noticed we've been having higher lows on the VIX since August? The highs have been all over the place, but the lows keep creeping up along an upward trendline and today stll didn't break it.
Sounds salty
Very unlikely. GA will not get the same Democratic voter turn out for Senate races since they aren't voting against Trump now. Plus right after New Year. Perdue easy win, Loeffler less so but still wins

How far OTM do you sell?
Hugely undervalued based on cash flow. Compare multiple to similar utilities even factoring in debt

Monopoly on largest state in America üí™
ACB expected EPS is -15 lmao. 40 times worse than NIO. Not only that but NIO is an extremely successful company
R/s inbound
How we playing the drop

And there it goes again
As if our support or lack thereof would make any difference.  I might as well make some money off big brother right?
I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING!
The biggest butthurt in history is gonna be the day impotent reddit idiots realize they actually have absolutely no power and will never actually be able to enforce their bullshit. It will be beyond worth the fascism lmfao
Lol isn‚Äôt that the one that sells like trash weed? There was some headline once that they delivered a bag of weed to a dispensary that moldy and had a rubber glove in it.
I did that too and had the same thought on the toilet this morning realizing that I just turned 5k into 1 k
Food for thought: 

GA Current vote margin: 1,589

GA COVID-19 deaths: 8,359

&#x200B;

PA current margin: 13,707

PA COVID-19 deaths: 9,009
Bye nio
Yeah didn't recent polls show like 65% of the military is against Trump
Mitch cutting bait


>  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday called for every vote to be counted, ignoring President Trump‚Äôs claims that the election is being stolen from him and vote counting must stop.

> ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted,‚Äù McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted Friday morning.

> ‚ÄúAny illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the courts are here to apply the laws & resolve disputes. That‚Äôs how
No.

This math assumes that every libertarian would've voted for Trump. In reality, true libertarians were just as likely to go Biden as Trump, as neither are libertarians, at all. But, even more likely, they wouldn't have voted if there was no libertarian candidate.
found a new thick vein in my unit today.  all in on hexo
Bye bye NIO
Well it's the weekend and I have to revise my outlook now that I got time, otherwise just SNAP, SQ, QCOM, little bit of Roku
ACB going to dip Monday or what? Earnings after hours. 

Anybody have a reason is shouldn‚Äôt pick up a few puts after this weeks run up?

Also I think there‚Äôs a lot of people that make Really poor decisions, I‚Äôm not talking about just voting for outdated conservatives,...but investment wise, it‚Äôs almost like they are allergic to making money, and cursed. Hopefully you changed your mind and bought some weed stocks when I posted
Bounced off resistance a bunch of times today and we're at the top of a consolidation pattern. Chances are we'll head back down over the weekend.

How do I short automod‚Äôs ability to cope with daylight savings
Nope it will never reach 503 again. ZM gunna go bankrupt now
Lmaoo you could be right but the odds aren't in your favor. If we see the trend turn around and not just consolidate then sure ride the wave down but id say higher prices are coming in the months ahead. Just my opinion
Yeah lol it‚Äôs all just a trap in general
BYND on Monday
Hold on for EOD pump
I‚Äôd keep my eye on it like a child in a playground full of needles. The CCP has been manipulating that stock for awhile now
Could be user error, sure. I'm also an e-trade user and it clearly states the same rule that RH uses where they will auto-sell or auto-exercise if you have the buying power. 1-hour before close.

The overall best action is just to call e-trade and make sure. They have good customer service.

Hmm I gotcha
Mostly interested on learning. I've been trading in the last two weeks and turned 200 usd in 250. I jumped on ACB before seeing this subreddit.
 When I bought I knew there will some kind of correction but i didn't wanted to wait for a dip.
Gotta see where we end today

It's a play for supreme gods. The stock has mooned so hard already that even slightly bad ER news could tank the shit out of it.
Thanks for jinxing it retard
I mean the CCP likes fisting Ma‚Äôs butthole so I suspect you‚Äôll see another one here soon
I got in on NIO at 25. Hoped it would drop more so I can buy more, but that shit just took off to the moon
If only your comments actually did something
 solid confirm double top since mid October, topping this month deviation channel, it is on it's last leg in term of momentum on a 180 day ema, you can expect it to have a slow decline back to the previous support of 346.....if SPY open above 350 on Monday I'll take the blame =\]
I was thinking about this last night when Biden got the "covid and economy" briefing.

  

What happens when day 1 he says "I have been briefed that true unemployment is 31mill and the true total deaths numbers is 330k - Mango covered up like a gimp"

  

Presumably fucking chaos

How am i supposed to inverse this sub if half think it‚Äôll go down and half it‚Äôll go? Make up your minds
Maybe people arent buying because they dont want to support it?
ACB pre-split?

well earnings is Monday 11/9  overall sentiment seems positive.. but in this market it needs to beat expectations and new positive guidance...  future wise it looks good for all cannabis related stock, with more states opening up, but who knows...
Son of a bitch, I‚Äôm in (gay)
Hold baba over weekend? 11/27 300c
Why tho
beaull trap
Why yes Mr. Market maker. I think I will dump 5k into gme weekly calls Monday and buy shares on margin.
Y‚Äôall better get into BMRG üò≥üò≥üò≥ might be getting merged soon with this random price action
Should have got in on ACB. Let the stoners lift you up!
Def should, I know mechanics who told me sometimes it‚Äôs hard to fight the urge to not fix/mess a car when a person being a dick but they do it but wish they could cause they know the person won‚Äôt know , can only imagine if the worker is delusional and makes a reason to not do it properly
Lol. So let me guess this straight. When someone says the market is going to go up, people say the market already priced in a Trump victory. When someone says the markets gonna crash they say it‚Äôs already priced in a biden victory. The autists hath spoken
What else you playing JEWBANKS?
I e heard that one before
Long on uvxy, debating buying more and selling monday when something happens
I fear they‚Äôll get bapped for earnings, so maybe after
why not
I have no idea what this means, translation?
December 16c

There are a lot of lawyers. One of the more oversaturated professions.
I agree. Guess we just wait for either the crisis or for a big player to realize the crisis is right around the corner and start selling off...
Damn that‚Äôs true thanks for your insight. I bought a few calls for Monday on the off chance they still made a profit.

I have 11/20 and 11/27 300. Next week will decide my fate.
Thx
exactly
The major forces in the market are not as gullible as Trump supporters. Markets will be fine once we finally have some stability.
I respect you trusting baba but I still thing XPEV is the move

Don't worry. They're still counting their tendies from all the bears that recently became extinct
As someone who works in the industry, just FYI no one evaluates a company based on their strain development. It‚Äôs 100% their efficiency, which means the crop yield (could be strain specific but mostly operation specific) and the quality and yield of their downstream processes like extraction and MIP.
thinking about a spy condor for Monday. Could be the play to put me out of my misery.

SPY 356-340 11/9
You literally know nobody in the secret service lmfao
Spreads are insane
Ban. See you in jail.
 If you go look at DPZ's earnings a few weeks ago, they crushed on sales, but their costs went up b/c the price of cheese spiked. I wonder if McDonald's will have a similar issue--crushing on sales, but more expenses due to supply chain issues with beef, cheese, etc.
How can I get rich like you? I only have 100$ please helo
Did anyone order the dump?
I just bought $305c 1/15/21
I got in at 09:32 on cgb and acb was up 4k, still up some but couldn't get out at the top because I made a ton of moves selling off 150 shares of NIO piece by piece to pay for calls.
Why do you keep posting this shit every comment you post has been -10 karma
Volume weighted ass pussy
do i hold NIO calls or sell?
Bro fuck fastly.

I have been holding shares for MONTHS. Made OK theta when the premiums were insane but now it is acting like a limp dick piece of shit üò≠
Oh right right.  

Thats what Im doing rn !
The fucking moment I bought ZM, this shit went down. I bought 40 shares @ 503, is there hope it will bounce?
is a blue senate possible?
Jesus I want to slap all of you who passed on PLTR when it was at $9. Why are you not hopping on government spying, it‚Äôs literally free money
Sellers had a chance to take the market way lower but failed to even with profit takers. This is a pretty bullish cool-down day.

damn i have puts expiring today. fuck
What would that do?
knew I should have bought that BABA dip. For once not a retarded move.
Come on AMD, pump higher.
They won't have a car for 2 years tho. That's a long time...
1 day stock pump is not going to affect the daily operation of any company lol.. Unless the company sells shares at the elevated price to raise cash.
Nope, I just avoid holding over the weekend
[deleted]
Wsb predictions are a sure way to make tendies as long as you do the opposite as suggested.
I'm with you. 600 shares and 40 option contracts dated out to April. Big catalysts coming up in November/December
Lol it was 370% IV when I just checked now. Fucking bonkers
Sell or Hold BABA?
Lol Back to August? Ez mode? Buy any 15 min dip?
Mandatory congratulations and get fucked.
I was actually going with cash gang, but them too.
Their wives and girlfriends will literally leave them if they lose the power they have. JR‚Äôs girlfriend hops from politician to politicians (she was married to current governor of California) and Eric‚Äôs wife loves being a paid spokesman for the Trump admin.
The next one is always around the corner in this crazy market when huge index moves drag almost all names up or down indiscriminately. Let's get this bread!
As soon as the erection if done in the news cycle you know we going back to kungflu 24/7
You‚Äôre probably right, $22.5 on Monday with a Green Day prior to earnings is more realistic. Earnings is going to be a gamble but if it‚Äôs positive, we‚Äôre heading to $25+
You can take my wife, but you leave me my ~~monkey~~ money!
I carried over the SPY puts from the week before which I was up 90% on, positive the market would tank due to election volatility. Yesterday I finally pulled the rest of my cash on the sidelines into FSLY and LI calls. Neither are working out well today.
does anyone else just put on WSBsynth and giggle uncontrollably
i guess outside of 2008/9, 2012 and 2015/16 each time it went under $2 lol
Holding nio puts over the weekend?
All those spy poots.... worthless....
Anyone else holding PLTR over the weekend? Or am I the only retard who didn‚Äôt sell in time
This is a good thing because you no longer have to fear $ROPE.
This guys got balls
[deleted]
So you basically just sell the furthest otm weekly calls you can afford and collect the premium even though it might not be much it‚Äôs very safe. You would only be required to sell if the stock hits the break even point correct?
Sorry to bring this down on you :(

In retrospect I should have just let it go. I'm down half a percent and I let bloodlust get to my head. Please don't ban this fool. I think he's been mocked enough, and if we kick him out we can't take his money.
Never. Its good if you are a boomer and have 5000 shares so you can actually make an income. But I'm young so I bought some AMD & WMT shares with the money.
Exactly
Facts. Shares gang should be banned imo
when he sells we sell
ROKU IS AT $253 definitely putsies
500 ACB
   
500 PLTR

Daylight savings, made this daily thread to weekend already?
Mango supporters
At first I read your comment at something like "just shoot him."

tbf that would kinda work too...
Actually it‚Äôs technically an infinity bagger since you start from 0 and go to 100k
Stimulus ain‚Äôt coming this year buttlicker
My gf is a co-founder of a cannabis company and they have to pay a bank like $1500 a month just to be able to use it because they‚Äôre the only option.
source for Biden saying that?

How does fox find all these boomers lawyers willing to shill and sell their souls for mango?? üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Only issue is as time goes on the only votes coming in are or Biden. Trump lost the lead in two huge states. Trump has to win every state that is still undecided. It‚Äôs not looking good
Infinity bagger
In what
Too retard. I'm out.
Nice, see you on December 4th at Bezo's house.
how much are 182.5 sq calls expiring today up by % wise
If my calculations are correct, yes the libertarian party cost him the presidency. He would've won Wisconsin, PA, and GA with the libertarian vote. Fucking LOL get fuked
NIOs got that ccp money
It looks to be headed further down. We keep bouncing back but only to lower highs.
sTRIKE eXP?
In some states the libertarian votes were more than the vote difference between Trump and Biden, but there is no way to know who the Libertarians would have voted for if not Jo. Some preferred Biden and some liked Trump. It probably didnt have much of an effect.
Pton and Fvrr were doing well. Everything else tho....lol
VIX
Probably an earnings run up also.. few report on Monday.
Thanks for the thorough response
Not really, pizza hut here is way better and a lot more protein/carbs for just 10 bucks for a large 3 topping. Exercising a lot allows me to eat more food so its great.

their drug failed
/u/WSBTrump is a furnace guy?
Because I bought in.
This markets so gay
Shares are great. Most people on wsb are stupid.
don't scoff at great advice
Bought a weekly nio put 11/13. Literally 20 cents is a    3k swing.
Thanks üôè
Yep we'll be back
No way MM's letting all those fomo 11/6 call buyers print today.
It's not sexy, but TGT leaps = money.
Why not both?
I'm from Canada you Nazi fuck. It's more developed than your redneck America. And Obama is a far better man and president than your retarded pig idol.
Buy the dip, VXX is still down 5% and barely rising.
Oof.. few weeks ago I did the same but with NIO... sold a $1 call for for $2.50... checked the other day and it was worth like $12. Those hurt lol
Still 30 minutes to get hurry up.
yea wtf halted. adjourned til after market .
What s a good tick to run wheels on? I have been wheeling TNA and AAPL but would like to try something new.
[removed]
Not gonna happen bro
Obama built the greatest economy before Covid hit*
You might be right. Maybe I'll get lucky and people will remember that there is  a horrible virus running rampant.
Even if I want to hold to the last minute? Gay

I spend 300k per year so I'm still fucked
Lot of retards still posting in the Daily ü§£
I really want to play MCD for earnings on Monday but that expected EPS is a bit high for my taste. Thoughts? They definitely have been killing it with their mobile ordering, marketing, and digital pivot lately.
Fuck yeah let‚Äôs get it
Was really hopin s s s s would do its 100% gain trick again
Why would u even say that
Anyone got any EOD plays besides spy put
My portfolio has been reduced to dust. Time to head back to reality
Spy price is too high imo
What did well on Sep 2 crash?
Aight
Just in case anyone didn‚Äôt notice, I was the first comment on this weekend thread.
Finally BABA under 300, just drop to 298 and Imma buy
He's convinced every military ballot will he for him

Jump in again at what price to own shares?
Bummed I didn‚Äôt get $roku calls at the opening dip..... üòî
Not looking too good...Spy couldnt hold 350
Yo if you make like 100k a year off ur job that‚Äôs like a 10000000000000000 bagger
this is USA not china, our reports are not doctored
I might be retarded but so is the very obvious consolidation of NIO

woah biogen halted on the FDA news... FDA news is bad.....
You‚Äôre going to get back in $O once it hits $56‚Äôs right?
I‚Äôm 1,000,000% okay with that
You don‚Äôt think BYND is going to make a retarded move for earnings?
Never seen Morningstar give a uncertainty rating as extreme. Not that it matters
Yeah mostly been theta gang and picking up some real stocks
HEXO wtf weed has retard strength
[deleted]
Get puts on CGC. No way it holds recent gains.
They‚Äôre prob gonna end up calling the election at 4:01 EST
I‚Äôm only a little bit better so I‚Äôm right with you. I trust it though.
I'll just wait for blood in the streets. Cash ready on hand.
My portfolio is in the intensive care unit right now, they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs terminal üò≠
Man I wish I could do this with Nio but all my shares are locked up in my vanguard brokerage account. Might start doing it with pltr though. I have 550 shares on Robinhood.
Sold the last of mine today
So, people think the ballot counters want to risk prison time by cheating?
i need a play like ttd

who's announcing earnings that we're sleeping on/
HUR DUR LOGIC AND RATIONAL THOUGHT. For real though, none of this shit makes sense. Time for puts. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen, I lose it all? OH WAIT.
MMs gonna deliver the biggest shrek dildo you've ever seen in 20 minutes
Lol worse i bought docu at top yesterday
When did you buy the options please?
What‚Äôs a good data center REIT?
Wait till earnings.

They'll blow a shit ton of cash, lose market share to APHA, and keep hoping that they can move into the US with Peter Thiel dollars and no brands.

Fuck TLRY
Nothing worth holding over weekend.
What's AMD gonna be at by 12/15?
I would imagine more Republicans would vote libertarian and a lot of moderates/ slightly left are definitely voting for Biden. It would seem like it.
Like eps matters, look at NIO
Biogen rip
[deleted]
What is that, like a quintuple top on NQ today? 12112 is just too strong to break.
They auto-sell if it's expiration day
A theta kings bff
It's doom o'clock fellas.
Slowly?
[removed]
Been trading/investing on and off over 20 years. It is never done as long as people do not hoard cash. Money from all over the world always flows from risk asset to another (and very quickly) when yield curves look like this.

Can't tell the short term, but traders back loaded large, new put positions in SPX between Nov 20 and Dec 18 after this massive rise, and that balanced the huge positive gamma a little, which makes me less apprehensive.
Anyone buy BABA calls at the top
üòÇwe had to follow him to brace for impact
[deleted]
Gonna be POWERFULLY flat

This didn‚Äôt last long :(  still happy tho 320 11/13
For fuck's sake I need to move on with my life, call the election, Jesus.
this is a good take. i dont know im pretty autistic can you elaborate more, why would it really hurt them in the long run

NIO
Jks is such a volatile stock. Think it could take off or do u think its overvalued?
ACB and Canopy earnings on Tuesday.  Either moon or get proper fucked.  Likely no in between.
I literally bought one cuz of this post. 
I think it is a good idea too.
Really NET? Fading this much...
Mango... what‚Äôs the difference between a mail-in ballot and military ballot????
Amd is literally amazing

All throughout the pandemic, barely fuckin moved

Goes up with the market overall

Even on red days it isn‚Äôt too badly effected

What a store of value

You're so stupid you don't even understand the definition of cuck. Let me repeat what I said before: Donnie Cucked you with false promises, idiocy, and pissed in your face while he stole your tax dollars. Yet you're out here, face down ass up, asking please sir, may I have some more.
SQQQ is a good cop for over the weekend, then charts are sexy
No civil war bruh
Huh? Etrade auto sold my options, hell I'm not mad it just dumped. Thanks, but wtf
I‚Äôve been hands off for the most part since September too
What if Trump grabs more states before Biden by the end of today & in the weekend.  On Monday morning, both are tied.
LOL have you been watching the market at all in 2020?
Not her fault her husband is not a trader!
Fuck yeah
Decriminalization would give cannabis producers and distributors legitimate access to the banking system, which is a big deal.
Explain
Lol!
was supposed to crash last week
Only like 30% or something. Yeah everything is obvious as fuck in retrospect, but I didn't toss enough money into my strongest plays because I'm a little bitch. FOMO really sucks ass, but it also can wipe you out too.. idk.
Not necessarily ban but will have super strict laws on who can buy them followed by stripping ppl of their firearms who dont fit the criteria
We're finally on our own
CGC 11/27/20 $23.50P 

Ran up as high (pun intended) as $24.98 today. Look at the 1-year chart. This isn't a particularly favored weed stock, I don't see any way it hangs onto the recent gains.
Wow a lot of people said weed stocks for the election, but you actually pulled the trigger. Ride to Valhalla, fellow retard.
I woke up and though spy was up at least 6%

Thats because my "portfolio" is nothing but AMD and TMUS which both went on moon missions
ü§°ü§°ü§° 320 next week retard
Probably going to ask someone else to come out and double check his work to be safe
Do you think Tesla is gonna be red Monday? Trying to decide if I should hold over weekend
Lies. Can't quit until you get your money back from the market.

If baba iv wasn't going down all day I can't even fathom how much more money I would've made
He literally called election fraud, markets are immune to his tweets now
Lol me too.
There is still hope, remember Tesla?
This is the way!
XPEV gang...think by Monday the moon mission is back up and running?
Im out of settled cash and sold all my positions today. Looking to get back in Monday possibly.
Covid, dragged out election, big rally this week - Monday likely red right? Don‚Äôt see how it won‚Äôt be?
[removed]
Do you see their expected EPS? Lol
Yes, I had been holding on to a few GOOD and O shares for over a year. Just sold them because fuck REITs. IIPR has been the only solid one.
If the Dems manage to take the Senate it's all over boys.
Glad correction is behind us
Is pinned until close and then down she goes based on some bullshit
Haha just saw u commented on my post. A drop is inevitable.
I haven't really been touching it since I took hits in September. Also I was able to download ToS at work so I'm able to stare at charts between actual work

Hold AMD. :)

I'm bad at this

For those more savvy, did the libertarians actually cost Trump the win? I mean that would be really hilarious.
Holy fuck. Thank you! I got in at $35 and was up $150 in 30 minutes. Stock hasn't moved. When do I get out hahahah. 

Scared it'll crash Monday and im all outta day trades :(
Got a few grand of BABA 0DTE 290c at $3 and sold at $5 thought I was a cool guy. 

That calls now worth $10.22
With hindsight, I should‚Äôve been patient with NIO, ACB held for a year :( oh well
Mm‚Äôs must know my name and will forever fuck my positions.
Cool
No, need something better. Elon's already daddy and Theil's already his daddy from their paypal days. So that makes their our great daddy once removed.... but, I was in the navy so,  I just call him Sea Daddy.

Most people want full legalization and many are hopeful we might have a president who listens to the people rather than just doing what he thinks is best for everyone.
This means you cant keep up with the timeframe you are trading. Just step a timeframe up from your normal trades and you will feel more comfortable.
Good point. 

But got to keep the masses fighting amongst themselves so stock owners can keep getting the real tax cuts. That poor person on food stamps is definitely the majority of your tax dollars. Lol... People are insanely easy to manipulate.
Yes, under $9 like the smart people
I do. Hi friend.
Because the overall trend of the nation is overwhelmingly towards legalization at this point.
Because five states legalized on some level plus Biden
Bc at the end of the day people don‚Äôt really know what he‚Äôs actually ‚Äúfor‚Äù 

They only hate the man in the big chair
Or nio 2022 leaps
Im holding stocks not calls
look at all them big ole pussy gang paper hands out there. Thought we were supposed to be making money the retarded way, not the r/investing wuss way all scared and shit. get rich retarded or die retarded. SQ 200c 12/4
Because so many states voted to legalize it, even red ones.
But none of this affects the wealthy :P
Yup
Whats up with these delivery companies smashing orders recently wtf I hate ordering stuff because they keep delivering broken items

hold nio?
What did you buy pre split and yeah you are going to need to call your broker and likely execute them if they are in the money which they quite possibly are.
The real answer to what‚Äôs happening with Trump and the GOP is that conservatives without term limits (reps and senators) realize that taking away states‚Äô ability to run their elections as they see fit with just a little bit of federal oversight REALLY hurts them in the long run. Ironically, taking this power away from away from states is the only way mango gets pushed through. Taking away state power over elections ALWAYS helps democrats.
[removed]
I'm betting around $5,000. It's a lot for me but it seems to be chump change for some people around here.
Just bought 10 after seeing all the comments lol. Always inverse wsb
ACB is going to 20 after earnings dummies
Yes.
It may not have been a serious threat, but people at that age, with that much spotlight on them, need to speak and act more professionally. You can't take pride in talking like a 4chan/WSB retard.
I got out and now it goes up
Sure is. I'm like a boomer holding stocks lol.
Holding HEXO calls and SNDL shares. Am I a tard?
That‚Äôs when I usually make money
U suck. Stop doing what ur doing.
That would be bullish fossil fuel because wed be able to frivolously use it again without getting fucked in 10 years
I think we retrace not crash
ACB, eh?

&#x200B;

I did the same thing. From up 100% to smacking my forehead in about 15 minutes.
What is that in real money?
Hello darkness my old friend
Hope you all got aboard the tendie train today.  Can't say you didn't have a chance next week.
Vix is reversing. Prepare your anus
ACB put holders - market didn‚Äôt get memo
It hard to be excited about joe Biden being president or trump like both options suck imo Joe Exotic for president 2024
Stocks to the moon into close let's goo üò§
Just think about it this way.


That poor soul working at McDonald's. You just got two months of his income for pushing buttons.

Why are cannabis stocks mooning so hard when Biden is just for decriminalization and not legalization
Should I consider PLTR? ü§î
Oh shit, two contested races in a week. We are in for a treat
Gay bears don‚Äôt trade calls though...
think it worth buying nio calls end of day lol?
Holy shit. I was off today and completely forgot the market is open.

This GME meme is for you OP
the shares being ok if you hold forever thing certainly does not apply to SQQQ. Stocks go up AND that thing has massive decay
If y‚Äôall think -0.08% corrects for the massive shrek cocks we saw all week, you‚Äôre in for a surprise next week.

I‚Äôm long, but hedge ur shit dawg.
Go back to sleep, it's 4:45am on Monday morning.
If this market doesn‚Äôt close 1% down me big trouble
I feel you bro. I hopped on at open and took 40% profit and left. This shit rose up like crazy. I FOMOed into it again and lost all the 40%
Goodbye North Korea.
Holding over the weekend

Are you gonna bet a lot? If so might make sense to get closer to the money, but obviously will reduce gains

I'm holding just 2x dec 22c but 600 shares at 19.75. Wish I would have set an order to buy when it went below 18..

Yeah I was on something similar but it was like turn $100 into $1,000 and then turn $1,000 into -$35,000.
At least you got something to show for it, worse is all the stress and ending up broke
Red and further rotation into cannabis.
God damnit.
EOD sell off started
TLRY WILL NEVER SPEND A DAY BELOW 10 AGAIN
12/18. Yes I'm holding hoping it rallies after Biden win confirmation. The IV crush would be insane thou, but the position itself is small.

The lesson here is ALWAYS inverse WSB.
Moderna stores their vaccine in -4¬∞. Fyi
The sheep goes Ali baa baa
Ass DD, the market was already priced in for a biden victory. And at this point it for sure is. If anything with the elections being over uncertainty will decrease and that‚Äôll favor the market. McConnell says there will be a stimulus bill by the end of the year. Market barely reacted to BLM riots. And Covid cases haven‚Äôt done shit since the initial February crash

Stonks go up

Edit: and remember biden winning doesn‚Äôt mean shit until late January when he actually has the job.
Bruh 200 percent gain from my side at 60. Sold it this morning.
Is there something like SPHD that doesn't suck? I need somewhere to dump my gains to throttle my stupidity
Cool - I'm impressed you were able to figure that out! 

I'm doing PMCCs against NIO leaps too but my strike is $50 :)
gay? Lol you mean big ole pussy gang
[deleted]
Yea but the problem will be that as soon as they say "we have a vaccine" they will also release the time table which is over 1 year for roll out. There's attempts to speed this up but we shall see.

Having a vaccine does not create herd immunity.  You have to actually give the vaccine and it takes an insane amount of time to roll these out to achieve a desirable immunity. 

Long road to recovery. Believe the science not the politicians is all I can say.
YOLO
BABA is the only way forward
75% MCD crash coming. Travis is signaling that McDonalds restaurants have a roach infestation problem. Foot traffic gonna dive. Thanks, Travis!
Shouldn‚Äôt have doubted my fucking vibe. Cost me mad tendies. Short vol into 11/18 and long beyond that is the way based on market signals. God damn it. I‚Äôm an idiot. Maybe someone here will listen. I clearly didn‚Äôt listen to my instincts
NIO increasing sperm count.
I‚Äôll have what they‚Äôre having
Stocks will dip of Biden is elected?? It‚Äôs basically looked like he was going to win the whole time the market went up 7% in a week. With that said.. he will bring us into a recession much faster than trump was so leap puts are the move.
\*Accomplices.  Don't forget they are named as executives in Trump Org.
You didn‚Äôt tho

I think decent face plant coming in next week or two for cannabis then up from there. I could also be completely wrong.
Think we‚Äôll get a winner by next week?
I didn't cash out everything, but I definitely took some profits today... why risk all your gains on the weekend cycle
Baba tryna reach 305 eod
Well done.  Save some coin for when the lockup expires though, especially if we get any new tax laws next year.
[deleted]
Limit up
in 2024.
Im being serious if everyone is agreeing with you here then you should dip Nio is the exception
I wanted to sell off at peak earlier but I got flagged as a day trader so I'm stuck till Monday... So I'm holding lol. Don't be me.
NIO ascending
I‚Äôm not in nio but most I know are profit taking
Jan 2023 $30c. If it tanks really bad (like $18 or below) I'll get the $25c instead.
It likely won‚Äôt. Class A, B, and C shares are deliberate for alphabet so founders maintain control through their B shares.

For any stock split, there‚Äôd need to be assurances that the same structure is in place. Why I doubt it.

So what if the stock is expensive, it‚Äôs still a great one.
Travel is going to be down for some time (hotels) and its becoming normalized that people are going to be working from home (commercial real estate). Biden is actually going to deal with COVID, so those trends should accelerate. 

I literally had my mom realign her 401k to get out of REITs.
watch out for the Epstein vote!!
[deleted]
Should have inversed WSB
ZG 1/15 up 30%. Might have to sell. TA not looking too good and sell the news kind of move. Although I wonder if this has some gas in the tank left for more gains despite what the TA says.
resistance can kind of be a thing though; there are definitely prices where the algos are set up to buy heavily
lol
its called gambling
I think it‚Äôs a good idea bro
>TQQQ goes up 25% in two day ahead of word Biden will win. 

Ya okay
peeps say earnings gonna destroy the stock
Good man.
Call me gay bcuz cash gang but fuck this market not holding over the weekend

i saw this the other day.
$20 11/20/2020 it is
What‚Äôs the expiry. Are you holding
He's irrelevant once he loses.  He's close to being there already.
yes, everyone is buying today thinking it will go up because the announcement that he wins meaning "priced in" it will dump
VXX calls seem so obvious that I'm scared to actually enter a position

Cannot believe I got the first comment in this weekend thread.

Feeling proud as fuck of myself right now.
Here we go NIO. Time to wake the fuck up and move.
Priced in
I'm holding until 4/21
BABA!!
The only direction they‚Äôre gonna go is down the rest of today
Imagine not selling with 300%IV
The real DD in the comments. Calls on IV supplies, paramedics, and Naloxone.
Low dose of high thc sativa until you're done with your responsibilities for the day.
Damn Yankees learn to say it right! lol
Up .86% on NIO today üòé
Angry people keep putting microphones where his laptop goes, angry that Yankees can't pronounce their country names.
I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll happen, it took 2 heavy news reports for it to drop. Along with Biden winning most likely (China trade wars held baba back) + holiday season.

It would have been 340-360 range easily this week if we didn‚Äôt have the ipo delayed or the slight profit loss (it was trading peak almost 320 last week)
Don‚Äôt we all
Idk if I should hold TQQQ 11/13 over the weekend. Fuck it I am.
GREEENNNNNNN
Doubt
Trump supporters are the worst man just had my furnace guy go off about the election. I‚Äôm going to be filing a complaint with his company and will not be tipping him when he is done.
That was also partly due to ANT IPO.
Is anyone else under the impression that REIT‚Äôs are fucked?
Funny thinking the zeros would be slapped after the 1
ha, poor fuck What are you gonna do with 10...oh um, ill leave.
Look at the volume rn
Toke up
I wonder how many people here tried screenshotting to post their gains and forgot to actually sell their positions and realize those gains, then losing money because of it.
Kinda his fault. Nothing stopped him from picking a Dick Cheney and just playing golf. He should have offered Kasich the twitter.

Sleep well over the weekend
Nah, I own shares.
It probably will don‚Äôt worry
Elaborate

No way!! Puts all day. Earnings are going to be a disaster on Monday. It's had it's run.
[removed]
ok then show me ur puts
A Macdonalds menu and the history of Diet coke
Sounds like a good one
I'd say there is like a 15-20% chance Trump is the last Republican president. The MAGA idiots are gonna change the Republican party into a shit show and I think the "real Republicans" are going to split off and make a new conservative party if that happens.

Its kinda true but I want to see the meltdown

$9.29 here; all you guys who bought my CC for the past couple weeks with no reward -- sorry (but thanks!)
What‚Äôs he saying
Biden already won, everyone already bought thinking it will go up because he'll win, it will dump
I see what you're saying, I just think you'd have a hard time timing the exact period the cool down occurs

I honestly think OTM leaps are the way to go since, as you said and I agree with, they'll continue to rise long term
The volume rn is 425 million, the average is 25 million.
Do I buy some weed shares or just throw more money at NIO? Haha
Ty acb.
You can absolutely tell this Georgia elections guy loves his state. It makes me happy to see it.
Green, today was the correction
Yes. Absolutely love her character.
I‚Äôm about to do what‚Äôs called a pro gamer move
Everyone was mega bearish last week and look what happened lol.
I wish Google would split.
Swing trade fam
Selling them far OTM. Im surprised the weekly calls for strike 45 were that expensive on Monday
Yeah no lockdowns happening nationwide. Maybe local. Nobody cares anymore
Yeah dude maybe only 1 but why wouldn't it? There's some election uncertainty still priced into this.
Anyone else able to turn $2,000 into $10,000 like it isn't a thing, but then try to turn $10,000 into $50,000 and it ends up back at $2,000?
no sure either. Wanted a nice pump.
switch baba with NIO
easy come ez go
Good thing these retards don't actually control anything besides our food supply.
I have this weird feeling were going to see 4 years of SPY 320-360-320 with the occasional dip to 310 if half the planet dies or something

What would you recommend instead of going against the grain?
Are you really that confident after the run up today? I want to be in but I‚Äôm also sus
Why does it have to? We've only went up since March bruh lol don't miss out trying to predict the reversal. Ride the wave.

Never thought of her that way but now I can‚Äôt unsee it. She‚Äôs great in that show though.
I‚Äôm just thinking since they‚Äôre all up high AF, maybe they will cool off in next week or two. I do think long term they‚Äôll come out on top.
Pretty cheap, I had a tight butterfly spread and closed its short leg.

About 3k cost, and I closed it at \~20k profit.
345 today i'll suck your dick
This shit is not worth the money I've made doing it. Puts on my mental health lmao. Sometimes I think I should just swing trade shares or be a boomer investor
I'm also betting on it being 50%
There is multiple safer/better companies out there. 

ACB is the NKLA of Cannabis 

Actually maybe CannTrust is, but you get the point
That‚Äôs it for the bulls. Take your profits and get out. Time for the bears to swim in your feces
Just trying to  save someone from FOMOiing in at the peak.

IDK why they are pushing past $85 now. Last week they barely had any steam to hold $78/$74

They will pullback to like $84/82 before moving higher IMO
Wow. Guess I should stop smoking so much weed during the day huh
What song is that
Fuck it holding NIO calls I guess
Hold 11/13 NIO calls over the weekend or dump?
I personally am not a huge fan of ACB but it does get the most traction. I would also check out APHA, TLRY, and HEXO. ACB splits the stock quite often.
Grabbed 3 contracts for shits and giggles.
LMAO

fuck. i forgot it was friday
lockdowns been priced in since march, but 2nd set of lockdowns definitely not priced it. it's gonna be a long & bad winter for COVID.

Ugh, kfc used to be my jam but now their chicken sucks.

BABA $300 bitches!
Any idea how Trumps Presidential Library will look like?

I think it will either be hilarious, creepy, or a golf resort.
It was 320 last week, just 2 really bad news that brought it down. We do have 11/11 alibaba event next week for increased volatility
For real now, wont see baba under 300 in ur lifetime, maybe after 10-1 split
Uvxy shares
I'm trying hard to blow up my account - Robinhood is definitely helping in that task.
I said I'd never buy weeklies after being down 40% this month... But I bought some weeklies shits fun af I was up 120% and am down again what a ride.

Got rid of pdt, lost 15% in 2 hours.  Thanks biden
You think it‚Äôs done? I feel like once it‚Äôs officially announced that Biden won it‚Äôll have another good growth day or two. What do you think?
Found the put buyer, yes lets buy ath good one.
Ah so that's why these have been early
yeah well the whole current bull run is based on the illusion that inflation is coming, which could not be further away from the truth. Stimulus creates only very short term inflation if any really, and QE is not inflationary and it is the proof we are in a deflationary environment. So neither monetary or fiscal policy are going to be inflationary, and banks are not lending (hence why there is QE right now, to spur lending growth) so its only a matter of time until there is a credit crunch/liquidity crisis and shit hits the fan
Delete this post. When all you fucking tards start talking about it, it takes a massive shit. 

FUCK OFF!
Hard to say since many states passed legalization or decriminalization, I don't think a Biden loss mitigates that
Honestly, I'm impressed by his kids commitment to him. They're on Twitter every day spreading misinformation like it's their job. Blood is thicker than water.
Wake up every morning and think about what you‚Äôve done. Let it hurt. The hate will keep you warm this winter
cash gang for now, chances are 50% it goes up, 50% it goes down, 50% it goes sideways
it's gonna stay under $297 through the end of next week, when my written calls expire.

Keep thinking it‚Äôs a bubble though.

The fact the market barely gave up it's ~10% rally this week should give you a good indicator of where it's headed
Really, markets closed  monday and tuesday huh?
you have a good point here. i suppose it will depend on if trump maintains a presence nationwide in that case
Whiff cheese?
This week has been great. I‚Äôm up 15% this week and the slow burn of Trump losing this election has been üòòüëå
I have a large horizon (years) so not really bothered with this. I know weed is coming, I just want to make sure the company I buy (well I have 500 of ACB) will be well positioned then.

Thanks for the feedback.
Would have been a better move to buy FDs with that money. You‚Äôd actually have a chance at getting a return on it that way

Yep I might lotto a call or two if Iv drops but I am not going in heavy on ACB or CGC anytime soon.

Unless there is another squeeze. The value of the equity is absolute shit but look at hertz. Squeeze could drive it up before it comes down...
Hmm might sell half if it can reach $12 a share and keep the other half for expection of $20
which one is the best one
Agreed
Put your dicks away
I think I wrote this...
Fucking blows!!! Trade desk wouldn't fix it for me. I'm mad at them

I can only hope that, as they stare into that window, that their eyes relax and they pull their reflection into focus and think to themselves: ‚ÄúWhat am I doing?‚Äù
Cool I don‚Äôt care, I full heartedly do not believe your trump supporter justification for those trucks surrounding and intimidating the bus and ultimately caused them to cancel the event. Your opinion is not the one of the general public.

Pick you entry point very carefully. If Biden admin decides not to move aggressively (I'm not sure they would) towards legalizing, it could be a while before you see return and it might even go lower for a bit. There are a lot of stops towards full legalization, including a lot of banking hurdles so understand you may not see much return any time soon. 

I invest in weed stocks because I love weed and believe in it as a future industry.

Last chance to buy rkt before earnings!!!
Was hoping earnings would be cause a dip back to upper 40's, and buy back a few contracts but nope...all I can do is hope the IV lowers on the short contracts before exp and get some credit back :(.

Looks smart, looks nice, doesn't help shit.
Tesla literally went to China because China had the largest EV market in the world - it‚Äôs as large as the US and Europe combined. China also has the largest EV charging infrastructure in the world, magnitudes larger than the US. 

I‚Äôm all-American and I‚Äôm rooting for America all the way and want America to come out on top but refuse to deny what the reality of the situation is - that American bipartisanship is preventing or at least dramatically slowing EV infrastructure/cars from replacing gasoline cars. 

You‚Äôre also saying that a Chinese company IS China when it‚Äôs really a private organization in China. Sure the government has influence but it‚Äôs in favor of the Chinese companies. The state of the American economy is currently in disaster might I add, and sure it might improve over the years, but what does that have to do with a promising Chinese startup that isn‚Äôt even selling in the United States? It‚Äôs a Chinese company in China with plans to expand to Europe, its BaaS is proving to be successful, it‚Äôs going for a 100/150kWh battery, backed by tech giant Tencent, has government subsidy incentives for customers, they‚Äôre building 60k cars/year w 154% increase YOY with a goal of 150k end of 2021 and they‚Äôre literally selling out of every single car they can make (demand > max output capacity). There are even more reasons but this post is getting long, but I will add that they also have a Silicon Valley office ready for when the US accepts EVs more.

A good company is a good company regardless of where it is. Plus NIO is listed on the NYSE so it follows American exchange policy.
‚ÄúJust donated $20 to the Trump Legal Defense Fund. I don't have a lot of money so I wish I could donate more, but I'm glad I did what I could.‚Äù

I'll be celebrating on my own though in the back of my 98 civic parked behind a Wendy's. Unbathed for months with a patchy neck beard. Screaming at people in the drive thru that I was finally right... one day.
Damn
Biden is going to oversee the eventual covid vaccine distribution and likely a large economic recovery. Now is that fair to attribute to Biden and the Dems specifically? No ‚Äî but they will get full credit because the average voter is dumb. I would not just assume the Republicans will win big in 2022.

Just like Trump and his supporters on here took credit for Obama‚Äôs economy even though Trump and his tax cuts didn‚Äôt grow the economy at a faster rate like he said it would.

should i hold my 11/11 -90% puts over weekend or are we gapping up next week? ü§°
Well atleast I've endured the worst of it.
R/conservative turning on fox news was funny. 

But now they're turning on republicans and the GOP, just sad to see how brainwashed they are.

PLTR hasnt "broken out" yet. This may be the first green day of many or it could very well go back down to 10 bux next week. earnings next week so maybe some good news announced.

Ya going to do it. Makes no sense not to
Bought in CGC and 12/4 $30c at the top today. Wondering how dumb of a decision that was.
Dude being a long term bear.....what? Have you ever seen a prolonged period where the American market wasn‚Äôt going up? Makes no sense to be a long term bear. Bro no bearish is for short quick bursts
This is the way.

God damnit, this sucks so bad.

Got killed for like 2 months. Every day, down thousands. Every dip,, went further and further and further.

Then reversed in 4 days. 4 fucking days. Stop lossed on half my shit because it just kept going down. And down. And down. And down....

Seriously though, be careful posting this shit lmfao
Bought about 3k worth of 23C for 11/13 at 10 am when it was pretty low. Hoping for a pump early next week.
After what peter thiel did to tilray, def a trap

If you hold ill sell. If you sell i'll hold.

Not selling at the worst time possible. I was playing Tesla once and it went from $415 to $407 in one morning and I sold at the low point after holding because I thought it would rebound. It eventually rebounded after I sold at a huge loss for $407. It shot up to $420 later that same day so I would have made a killing if I just held. Those where just shares though but I was using 4 times margin and had $100,000 in shares with a $25,000 account.
lol 0.70 on spy. this is what we expect now
Then he can sit back and relax. Don‚Äôt get too excited on the ups and don‚Äôt panic on the downs. 2021 EOY price should be 60-70 bar any major crash/bubble. 80-100% annual ROI is nice.

Trump has been more muted than I would have imagined, I thought he will out here doing rallies and trying to rally his supporters and of course tweeting a lot more. I am suprised.

Policy-wise I agree that this was not a victory for Democrats but I think you're underestimating how much having Trump's brash attitude in office emboldened the far right. Trump wasn't just a symptom of the far right, they fueled eachother and I'm celebrating, even if it has a minimal impact long-term.
Think we end the day slightly red and go up bigly green on Monday. My account has been neon green all week long though.
Hold until next Friday

just shares rn bro
LOL. stonks only go one way boisss
Exactly
My calls bought yesterday say no
Uber $55 11/20 calls are so cheap. The market is going to have a blow off top when Biden is actually declared the winner. Pure euphoria play
What is it with all these short term holders: if you like it buy abs hold. Thinking your going to make millions selling once a stock goes up a bit is stupid.
bought today, already  CGC $23.5 call¬† 11/20    better than ACB?
oh well, this week sucked. being a long term bear is depressing af. you know its going to hell, so you suck at taking short term bullish opportunities, and you lose money much more quickly

Yes

But Dems gonna have Warren and Bernie on Cabinet so you can forget about less taxes
Absolutely ridiculous. I don‚Äôt get why the prop 22 jumps them over March levels when that wasn‚Äôt even an issue in March and again missed earnings
We need to create an inverse etf based on this guy's "trading ideas"! Never ending gains!

They crushed last earnings
I‚Äôve been trading Canadian weed stocks since 2017 (not in recent years) because I‚Äôm Canadian but fundamentals don‚Äôt mean shit when they pump. APHA has never pumped as much as shitty ACB and CGC
Thus proving how terrible you are at researching anything.
No problem dude. Glad you made some money. I just hit 100% gains.
Great advice. When they dump it's practically free fall.
Alright last one... MRVL $45 EOD
I got NIO puts 3 weeks ago... checkmate!

Why is weed tanking lol
It's actually my first attempt with a put. I've done tonnes of calls. But put always made me uneasy. 

Here's to beginners luck! üçªü•Ç
Less taxes is way better than a stupid stimulus
SNAP is a bargain right now, so undervalued at $67 billion
Ok, I get it, congatrs on the trade then. But still they are not earning money. Biden might pump, but earnings are bad. Your decision which you trust more.
Hold or sell $BABA through the month with a 11/27 c option
No worries. Big JB said he would shut down the virus but not the country. I am 0.5% positive he has any idea what he said.
Traditional US auto manufacturers are crippled by the auto unions. It is really hard to make a profit and grow and re-invest when Janitors are making 100k a year. I will never put money into them.

All the canadian companies are shit but ACB and CGC have american footprint. Apha has a beer company they bought for 6x revenue.
Ya that would be fantastic id get you a beer
something like WMT that trades similar that releases really good news will gap up, fall a little and then stay at that price for weeks
Hold the line, you will be fine come Wednesday AM
Nope.

The MMs sell puts, which makes them positive delta.

MMs then sell shares to get negative delta.

Hedging their directional risk.

Retard
When is your funeral?
How‚Äôd you do today? It touched 200. I sold my 190 calls for a good profit, although coulda held on a bit longer. I‚Äôm too paper hands to hold a good profit over a weekend and let it drop next week.
[deleted]
I believed it was gonna be bull but now everyone saying bull the markets hear us and they gonna try to fuck us raw no lube
Yes this. So the MMs can squeeze it!
In 11/13 $352.5c
Just wait until after earnings my man (or woman) ... the chances this thing stays elevated are pretty slim in my opinion.
You can sell anything you want on Monday bruh you‚Äôre just out of day trades
An end of day drill for profit taking is so obvious that it won‚Äôt happen simply because it is so obvious.
[deleted]
Well big tech skews left.  Like twitter flagging Trump's tweets as if we needed a nanny to step in and tell us how to feel about certain tweets, or banning the NYPost Biden laptop story from being shared etc.  So republicans are pushing back because they don't like the power google/twitter/reddit has created etc by influencing with ideology.

But yes Democrats also aren't a fan of low regulation on big corps and they might take antitrust more seriously as well so you're both right.
Hey guys, don‚Äôt be dumb, buy DKNG calls. Long ones. Like that one guy from The Boys. He‚Äôs got a long d. Like these calls

Glad I sold ACB before it hit this low.
I had taken out plenty of Overstock calls in April, sold them a couple weeks later
At 27.5! Got the biggest I told you so ever hahahaha
It‚Äôs Bernie math 2.0. And then some weird ass conspiracy theories thrown in.
I think acb gonna burn the shit out of me on Monday.. I have lost all faith in stonks

Welp ACB is gonna fuck me on Monday and all I can do is watch
I've never felt like more of a clown for working my 8-4 until this very moment
When I buy I go all in on one ticker. I sold the same day it crashed so im not holding any bags. Same with Tesla. I might buy rocket again soon though. Maybe just shares and hold them for a while. When it was $18 two days ago probably would have been the time to get in though.
Just sold. It‚Äôs bleeding. I was up good too and just let it fade away
I wouldn't even be mad if spy drilled like 30 points in the next hour. I am numbüíÄ

Yup. Last time ACB reported they dropped around 20%

If we all do it the MMs have to sell shares to hedge, causing it to dump!!

Do it now!
I wouldn‚Äôt call it confident yet, but exactly as you said. Future of EV. I‚Äôve been meaning to set aside some time and really deep dive into the industry and look at every component and company doing what, these guys are one of them. Willing to bet really bigly on somebody who‚Äôs forward thinking and innovative with lots of cash or investments and room to grow. One untapped sector that‚Äôs sitting in my head is swappable batteries. Something in its zygote infancy but could really overtake charging if EV matures. Too early to say what‚Äôs what yet but like I said, willing to bet on somebody just don‚Äôt know who yet. Gobbling up information from others and making sense of things is a start.

Lmfao, again. National guard troops are here, and they all know eachother and their plans personally to defend the cheeto. They are all currently deployed together because of the unrest scenario. You have no idea what you are talking about.
Buy eod and sell Tuesday market open, I followed the last two events and they had the same trend. Only difference now is this election shit could crash it next week.
I had my finger on the button to go all in BABA calls yesterday. Instead, I decided to be responsible and bought 3 shares instead. Lesson learned. Just go all in
Agree thanks

Does anyone have a quick primer on wtf is happening with banks and treasuries today? Something weird happened or is happening for /ZB, /ZN, TLT and XLF to all be down. KEY was up and it arched down with everything and HBAN had been a diagonal line down. Even the big ones like JPM and BAC are selling off
ACB UNDER 10 PUUUUUMP
lmao >70% of the state's entire population lives in Clark county.
Would anyone else be a millionaire if you held onto a position just a little longer or if you bought that call you were second guessing yourself on?

Short Tilray in a week, you make 4 times that.
Also, last earnings they crushed and are profitable now. If that trend continues, massive good sign.
wut?
They had solid earnings, did you not see?
It is but not rn. These stocks should be long term investments.
Just an FYI for the people reading this. they were at 100+ at their ath and now look at where they are at. This is for good reason

They had a rough last few months due to a short seller report that was completely false. Hence, the big dip. They are the second largest EV company in the States, behind Chargepoint (SBE SPAC). I am also invested in SPAC.

I really do suck at life man, wtf... fkg APHA sucked ass today, I could have gotten in ACB at open for a nice gain, but I went for fkg APHA. fuck fundamentals at this point. momentum is everything in this market, the rest doesn't matter until the moment we crash
Hmm... should I hold this ACB call through earnings on Monday? I feel like these shitty weed stocks always tank on earnings
Ya, what makes u confident besides obviously future of EV?

PSA TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW AT WEED STOCKS:

ACB, and all weed stocks, are up on renewed Hope's of legalization. ACB has earnings PREMARKET on monday. I highly advise you to consider you positions carefully, ESPECIALLY if you recently got into ACB. Until legalization becomes more offical this stock will continue to pump on hope and dump after the hype.
FYI RKT peaked at $33.82 last earnings.
Oh shit, we‚Äôre back to stimulus news? This is so exciting.
b/c we're back to near ATH after this week's pump?

Volume is what drives the options prices up because of how many people want in. So yes.
With regards to the actual stock holders, the answer to the earnings question is more about the investor and less about the stock.

You wanna ride this thing to the moon in 2030? Forget worrying about the earnings then. Who cares if it drops or goes up after. It will be up in the future either way.

You want out to find a new carrot to chase these new found tendies? Sell on Wednesday.
Fucked in the ass by weed stocks.... God fucking damnit I need to stop FOMO'ing into this SHIT without having PDT.

Vaccines from various manufacturers will start to be shipped to pharmacies beginning next week. They will sit on them until the FDA gives an emergency use authorization (TBD) to begin administration.

also, that was the point he made against Trump, since he wasn‚Äôt giving a shit. Lot‚Äôs of pp turned from red to blue, just because of that debate and right after Trump got the virus showing weakness.

I'm trying to figure out the RH magic that allows you to sell 5 contracts with 300 share collateral. Or are you seriously selling 2 naked calls on a meme stock?
Nice call bro. What do u think about Monday?

Up 8% on basically nothing except post election anxiety relief this week. COVID cases continue surging meaning calls for lockdowns going to happen around Thanksgiving. Add Q4 profit taking on overheated market - ppl will probably start taking profits earlier this year to avoid the stampede.

Those groups were around long before telegram, and they haven't changed except to be more visible. They lack the organization and the skill to form a cohesive threat, particularly the ones who are in the military. Police worry me a bit, but military leadership will do what all military leaders have done for millennia -reposition groups whose loyalty is in question so that they are either irrelevant or embedded within known loyal groups. The joint chiefs might be able to pull off a coup if they liked Trump. The "fighting men" could not. They would be scattered and neutered long before they could mount a serious effort.
keep your head up just bounce back harder, change and fine tune your strategy
He would need evidence of malfeasance to have a chance in court, so none.

Even if ballots that arrived after election day aren‚Äôt counted, Biden is winning currently without those ballots being counted.

take the next week off bro. I've been down big since Sept, recovered like 10% this past week thanks to Sleepy and after some last minute repositioning I am taking a break because its getting to me too. Just buy a month out call on weed, tech or clean energy and just keep it closed until mid Nov
whatcha think, is it coming back down to earth or will it shoot up again?

buy atleast 100 shares, sell a call i/o buying it.

You get payed instantly, but now your locked into holding those shares untill expiration. If the calls you sold go in the money and the person who bought them choses to exercise, you sell the shares at the strike price and keep the premium.

If you had played earnings, and selling your calls before earnings and buying puts after in the last 6 months you'd have done pretty well. It bounces back like clockwork because it always oversells to 3.5-4 and gets bought back up to 5-6.

honestly i don't imagine it's even a blip. like if it were to be quantified and we were to take "1.00" to be average daily productivity, this election might decrease it by 0.00000000000000000001 or some ridiculous shit. i bet the collective hangover after the super bowl is more of a shock but even that is probably not enough to be considered significant.

having said that, that's not to say that this shit doesn't affect people's productivity, it's just that i think throughout an average workday (thinking largely 9-5 office jobs and shit) productivity is already so low. most people probably spend like 15% of their days being productive, now their down time is actually filled with something and it feels like a distraction
I laughed so hard while selling them to you. Then realized I'd find you here. Care for a Bud?
Actually its pretty good on a state level. Most states leg's stayed the same or "close enough" from 2018 to help liberals. Florida will be heavily gerrymandered for reds but AZ, PA, NC (maybe?), and GA are all looking to get more even

What's on your $exy $tocks list?
What would you expect right now
I see, you were referring to the postal system cuts.

&#x200B;

I don't think anyone thinks the mail system is currently fine, the service cuts led to some ballots being delayed before they arrived at the bureau of elections. Additionally, the talking point isn't "the mail system is fine", it's more "the ballots that are being currently being counted are not improper in any way."
Is it time to buy the AYX dip?

It‚Äôll skyrocket to $22.50 for sure. Maybe $22.55. I think $23 is waaaaaaay too high for this stock to moon to, it‚Äôs moves like a goddamned treant.

That‚Äôs also my plan. I had all my investments in ETFs and index funds but obviously the volatility and fear and so on has been too much.
/NQ resistance at 12100 (long term trend since 8/31) held throughout the day, and now we coming down a bit....so my guess is dump during power hour.
I think we could see $20 by the end of the year. But who knows what earnings will bring, it could send it sky rocketing or it could send it down.
BLNK earnings 11/12. 

BLNK expands employee base by 30% due to EV demand. 

BLNK benefits from incoming presidential result. 

BUY BLNK.

As Mr Goldman said BDX which is a medical division could potentially go moon since they‚Äôre the 1st in vaccine production and testing. As Bidden, the most likely future president said, he will react and invest heavily in vaccine studies for the COVID19.
Should we be buying calls for BDX next week? I really believe that when Bidden gets elected this is the first thing he will use money for, and it will be announced next week, driving BDX‚Äôs stock prices to the moon.

Your not wrong, people on the far left love to shit on that sub but I've gained a new found respect for them.

I bought it the day before the big crash but with faith in shkreli I decided to hold and so far it's getting close to breaking even; which is good because I bought monthlies so I got a whole month for it to go gang busters and bring a sweet harvest of tendies to the faithful.

Hyliion earnings next week . Will there be a run up?
fuck you I'm not 21 and IBKR won't allow me to trade options.

on top i missed out on today's ACB gains cuz I couldn't buy premarket as I didn't know about settlement T+2 cuz my old broker didn't have it and my cash won't settle till Momday&Tuesday next week
does anyone believe a real dump will happen at this point?
40x 11/20 18c avg cost .225. Probably selling half before earnings to cover position + some profit and leaving the other half to gamble. But we‚Äôll see.
If there was ever a time for VIX calls...
ACB puts
After this week I'm just fine with a flat ass Friday.
I went 100% in today at 12.13. Sold at 14.23. Should have bailed out at peak but greed is my downfall
Go to casino put it all on black twice?  Easy peasy man
let's take bets at where we end up today

Is this the best buy in san francisco? Looks familiar to my local best buy

Its going back to low teens again as we melt up imo
you said "sundial now" 3 hours ago too. By the way, no penny stocks, take this over to /pennystocks
Haha sndl has been nice to me. Sold a bunch of covered calls and bought more shares. Down a lil on shares due to avg up, profiting until .2. If we pass .2 before earnings I‚Äôll get a few thousand more
Doesn't APHA have a better balance sheet than almost all of its competitors? It has a much bigger market share than CGC even.

It can‚Äôt move because cash gang is frothing at the mouth for a dip to buy into - which kills any actual potential for a dip. Every .1% drop gets bought instantly. And since MM‚Äôs have lost their upward momentum, it just keeps shuffling sideways, unable to die, but nowhere to grow.

The irony is real
Enjoy your half human half ostrich babies
Amazon and Apple usually start pumping around this time of the year in anticipation of the holiday season.

Buy 8 week calls on both.
Minimums for gain porn.
You can use it right away
Can I get a NIO pump one time into close?

I AM holding, retard
people here saying it's gonna tank on earnings. but if people here were correct, it wouldn't be wallstreetbets
Hold 11/13 RKT 20.5c thru earnings and sell on Wednesday or just sell it before on Tuesday?
I literally closed my position 2 hours ago with a 40% gain on fckn shares that I held for less than a month.. Was planning on building out the position for the rest of the year. Yeah ima wait....

Fox News playing that 4D chess.  Calling AZ for Biden to appear less partial, and then spread the election counting disinformation
Refusing to open RH until I see people on here freaking out about NIO and SNDL gains
Once Bidens dementia kicks in we'll get stimmies every week >
I would entertain this thought. That he did it as free publicity to grow his brand name and set him up for potential lucrative opportunities. That is backfired and his position got called. Essentially by becoming the president he fucked his own play.

BABA drops on earnings. Pops the following week

True. JPow say, ‚Äòno volatility, no premium sellers. Long or destrroooy!‚Äô
I'm expecting that, and I'm expecting covid to head the headlines again, thus considering something like $SPXS short term call, let's say 12/18
Weed's already gotten a bump but could bump higher.

lucky you man, haven't worked in 4 days i cant afford to slack off
I am not saying to go all in today! Guidance was terrible, the new CEO is even more bearish than the previous one. But the actual numbers were good! The product is great. And they will have massive tailwinds next year. Rational is: First phase with COVID was setting up e-commerce and going into the cloud. Next phase will be about optimizing this new normal. Many of these companies don't have a clue about coding... Alteryx is a no brainer
Love reddit bias.  This moron can say this but if you say Obama was mediocre,ban for most subs.  Yet this broke bitch from some third world country getting paid by the ccp in rubles can incite violence.

Good idea. I don't have much confidence that the housing market will stay hot.
Holiday season is coming so I'd look into Amazon and Apple.
Can I get a F in the chat for vix
Want to yolo 4K , any plays left for today?
18% up on Xpev. All gone now.
Why does it keep gapping down?
Weed and renewables
Shouldn't it be pumping but the whole thing is a flaccid dick today exempt tradedesk.
You're in good company
The amount of ACB bagholders here on Monday will be phenomenal, IV crush will be insane.
I swear being cash gang is worse then losing money lol
Haha thanks. We are all ~95% on the plays in our head and struggling for 50% on the plays in our account.
There are no earnings, they are burning money. Please sell at least some part of your calls... oh.. you are holding shares. Nevermind then, might hold those and gtfo of this sub.
Liberal snowflakes and their safe space!

*proceeds to make a safe space for conservatives*

Lol ACB. Today's volume is over 3x the float.
Buying is low volume, selling is generally higher volume
Fine with me. It just bounced back from 108 like instantly.
What‚Äôs guaranteed to pop next week ? Post election Biden wins
Sundial now, thank me tomorrow
should have doubled down and buy at the dip. This company set up for success in the future
Meta-autism is beyond the scope of this subreddit's support.
Already in 11/13 and 1/15
The company is absolutely dogshit. So yeah
This is NOT a penny stock. This is NOT a pump and dump show.

This is a very serious company run by very serious people.
It hasn't been a good run at all though has it
Do not hold this through earnings. It will tank.

Thanksgiving Dinner going to be super awkward for Jared for a long long time.
VXX looking like it wants to be delisted.
Wait until at least 9.20. Don't know if that'll hold but better than buying now.
oh for sure, but is he running as a Republican or Democrat?  I don't see him winning either primary. Republicans are going to run Don Jr or Ivanka or some bullshit
Good gay bear
If it breaks 300$ EOD should be juicy. Still not close to overbought on rsi and volume is strong
Probably Monday AM, going to be cheaper unless it rips higher over the weekend.  Even if it dips $1 you probably lose 20%

My calls bleeding
Keep up the good work.
Should have played more MCD more aggressively
Impusively bought ACB call at the top today. Down 30% should I take the loss before ER Monday?
Not sure your situation. When u bought & such. Should be worth $515 or so? If you‚Äôve made profit sell it. U could get exercised, otherwise.
Ok, I‚Äôll have to look into how to do that. I‚Äôm kind of an idiot lol
I thought they d be green on sell volume :/
Why so conservative
Honestly feel like I should abandon my spy call. Fearing a dump later

I bought last dip after earnings and debating again. Hit me with that sweet DD
NIO 250M so far, daily average is 121M...guess everyone is there

i read it as 150k into 10k
This is just despicable comma usage.
 No take profits
so I am basically flat on ACB and slight loss (4%) on PLTR.

unsure if i keep for earnings or dump and go back to flipping rolexes.
Uh last time we locked down I doubled my portfolio. It‚Äôs not a threat to the market

Not only that, but the right has de-funded IRS to the point that they exclusively audit people in this retard's tax bracket, lmao.

His party ensured that only the fabulously wealthy can get away with tax fraud, so he will get caught.

I am still amazed by this delusion that the Republican party gives a single fuck about people making 50k/yr
why did i buy puts on spy, i should have known Mr.Bigly would grab me by the pussy and take me
Tax all religion we gotta pay it so do they! None this fweee property tax bull shit. I worship my tv every Sunday and I have to pay. So do they!
Glad to do my part after how much bears have helped me given 95%+ my option trades were calls and bought almost every dip since August.

After mooning all week all bears can get is a bit of flatness.
did robinhood get an update wtf is this
Any good ones?
I took your advice and I'm happy I did it before this pullback. Thanks!
Thank you for the alert. Tempting to buy a little more at 13.5.

Alright retards someone give me a nio play
Cause MM‚Äôs pinning it until Monday. It‚Äôs gonna fly all week and touch 55. But the game is rigged and MMs say you shall not pass 42.50 until 11/6 options expire
Calls, hold
On?
Volume in SPY is concerning. Big money staying cash gang?

Literally sat here all day like a retard with puts and cash watching my puts lose value and my cash do nothing when i could have just bought calls for a day trade.  Sometimes I really do deserve to lose.  This what happens you're a bull and convert to a bear for a day or two.

You live in the never-ending-story land for all I'm concerned. Wtf are you even talking about? There are legit parties from both sides observing the process. It's only transparent if you gun-toating woke citizen assholes get to lean over the shoulders of poll counters, huh? The real ‚ùÑÔ∏è of the world.
so what's your philo, buy high sell higher?
Bet
Bought at $5.50 sold at $3.00. 

Fuck me
I feel like it‚Äôs priced in. How many of us really expect Trump to actually concede? At this point the Rs see the writing on the wall lawsuit or not and are ditching him‚Äî they would rather not fuck up 2024 by going down with the ship. 

Besides Lindsey Graham who I‚Äôm positive Trump has been blackmailing at this point, there‚Äôs no legitimate reason for him to keep supporting him unless he thinks he can inherit Trump‚Äôs base somehow.
there was not a single person out there who didnt buy or sell who already had positions? Fucking wild lmao
NIO is cheaper/more upside.  That's where the money is flowing right now.
I had 1,000 shares at $10.... I sold half at $14.50 I‚Äôm long I just am hoping for a little pull back before/after earnings

I also sold my all of my 11/6 $10c @ .90 oh that hurt
at what price?
What's a good buy for the weekend not named RKT
Lol pretty red when it doesn‚Äôt go up 2% everyday
gme stonks and calls checking inüí™
Now actually 2 hours ago but this will do
This is very boring.
Ivana Trump, Melania Trump, & Marla Maples.

Fuck, Marry, Kill.

Go
Not true. A volume of shares equal to or greater than the total number of outstanding shares was traded.
You still have a bit left you‚Äôll bounce back
With how volume went off a cliff today I am worried about ur future tendies but right now I‚Äôm not very optimistic that it will moon before earnings
I believe this is the IVR situation repeating itself
Depends on what you get. My timing sucks but my patience is great
does etoro have a settlement period or can u use your cash right away?
I'd say sell half cuz your up 100% and hold the rest, they already dropped to $10 again
Paper hands today and you‚Äôll have crackhead eyes on Monday
[removed]
sell covered calls against them, worst case it drops and your entry cost is lowered.
You‚Äôre confused. The last two months were all red. We‚Äôre certainly in a ‚Äòmore certain‚Äô position than we were a month ago. Stocks like certainty.  Going up.
They'll drag his fat ass out
Snooze fest can't wit for them to dump it next week
Hang seng has been pumping baba like crazy this past week just for ameripoors to drag it back down. Also baba always pumps a few days after earnings. gonna see an iv spike too hopefully
About to sell these AMD calls for a loss
Just waiting for kndi to go back up again.
That‚Äôs not how VIX works
Because you touch yourself
Problem is most republicans watch fox news and think everything else is fake news smh
It certainly is duh
The earnings part was an oversight on my part ugh
Feels like we got a new batch of newbies üëÄ

Trying to explain how Biden is bad to these retards doesn‚Äôt even register. The reason markets are performing is because the election is in litigation.

how much float does $ROPE have right now
Don't forget Trump.

Everyone close to him has recounted how the blood basically left his body when he was announced the winner in 2016. He never wanted to win, he just wanted to stir shit up, create a bunch of conspiracy theories, and become a right-wing talking head for money.

Dude is dug in too deep now and is too narcissistic to admit defeat, but that dude never ever ever wanted to be president.
I claim it back and I deem it illegal for you to claim it back.

I feel a lot more confident betting against China over the next two years than the USA. I would trust my money in Chinese companies priBut this if far more specific and targeted than that sweeping statement. The reason I don't play shorts in general is because I can't bet American spending confidence as reflected in the stock market. 

I think this retail wave can continue to pump NI0 but once the 4.5T on sidelines returns I think that will stop. RH traders will still have a role in option pricing but I think our "guidance" will be severely softened. Like I personally believe tesIa had a far better year than if covid didn't happen, RH/WSB directed the more risk tolerant funds still playing into hiking it up (I'll call it prematurely because I like tesIa)

Anyways, I dont believe NI0 can ever be an auto EV heavyweight. But I haven't done a full fledged DD on it but plan to this weekend.

Literally every single ACB share traded hands today
Shares, 1 Leap Call, and some Short Calls for earnings.

Hoping next week will payout for short Calls. Holding Shares to see what happens
Well I think I bought every available CVS 65p for December and it almost instantly dropped $1.  Covered costs and will just let the rest ride I guess.
Fed Gov cannot issue a nationwide lockdown.  It's not in their power.  They could tie funding to it but 26/50 states would say no thanks.
buy calls.
Never said Biden was better or even good. If you lose the election you leave the fucking White House, that‚Äôs democracy.
Either you were born in the last 3 years or you have amnesia.  The gloating post-2016 lasted well over a year
Lol. Is now a good time to get in on acb?  It went up 150% today, does it have room to run?  Like no man, you missed it
yea i was looking at that hard as part of a strategy team at am oem i worked for back in 07. i thought they were really onto something, who wants to have such a depreciating and hard to dispose of asset like a battery, when you could have a network that swaps them for you. to me its like do you want t 3000L fuel tank at home in your yard, or do you want to go buy gas at the station and let them deal with the hassle? be interested to see where this goes
In June IVR went from a CMBS REIT no RH trader knew or cared about but they released news which created a short squeeze. RH traders noticed without knowing why it dropped in the first place and bought in a massive frenzy to over double what a CMBS would be valued at in terms of book value, then once people stopped buying into to momentum everyone collectively learned what IVR actually is and it drifted back to valuation, but the start if that play and ACB look just alike. RH are going "Dude, legal weed bro!" And buying into momentum without knowing how much financial and leadership turmoil ACB specifically is in.
I respect that
Im sorry bro, it's been crazy, don't know whether to hold until Monday, or sell and diversify.
The Earning reports sre gonna be pretty terrible, but I don't think that will affect the stock too much

For fucks sake retard
  
All of that exists within the progressive bubble. The orange cunt actually implemented far right shit: judges, policies, rollbacks
  
If you want to argue the "fat tail" moved left then fine but the body of the window moved so far right that *MOST OF WHAT TRUMP DID AND SAID WOULD BE ILLEGAL UNDER ANTIFASCISM RULES IN ITALY AND GERMANY*
  
Eg calling immigrants rapists, packing courts (the EU is literally raping Poland and Hungary for this today), controlling the justice department, muzzling whistleblowers and intelligence agencies. The overton window isn't about the window of acceptable discussion, it's about normalisation of extreme views until they are no longer shocking.
  
All of the policies you describe would be considered centre-right to far-right in Europe
  
Edit: fascism comes from the Latin/Italian for "to bind" meaning binding the military, religion, judicial system, police and media etc into a single unit to exercise total control against elements that are considered "the outsider" eg those that don't conform to either the majority rule or the minority rule. That means Muslim bans, firing officials that don't agree with the leader, reducing funding/castrating regions that have different political views, standing alongside the oppression of minorities, militarizing policing or using the military to police the population... Do I need to add links MAGgot?
Now, IV would be higher next week probably because the event is in a few days
Trumps still president lol Biden‚Äôs not doing shit till January
> easily

Yeah?
Call can‚Äôt happen before the bell... thinking it‚Äôs gonna stay pretty flat until maybe 30-15 min til close and we‚Äôll get a pump or dump. No way this thing doesn‚Äôt get called before the bell Monday

And I've held over 1000 shares since they were sub $6. I'm the first one to tell people that SNAP is different than other social medias when everyone tries to compare it to IG or Twitter or FB. But the fact is the huge green spike today was due to the news that Bytedance was seeking a $180 billion valuation in their next funding round. My favorite comp of SNAP is WeChat
Massive spike of Covid cases , Biden could issue nationwide lockdown..

Markets ignoring it , hmmm
i get its risky company, small cap, but the risk/reward seems pretty decent for a small amount of capital

Losing the election has separated the narcissists from the sociopaths. 

Sociopaths know when something is no longer beneficial to them and just walk away and reboot.

Narcissists violently flail against anything that challenges their delicately assembled worldview.

It gets even more retarded than that. People think that having a democratic president who has a son who was (is?) addicted to drugs and a Republican controlled senate still leaves open the chance we legalize weed. There is the slimmest chance in hell that we get federally legalized marijuana.

You didn't.  You made the best decision you could at the time with the information you had.  Try to avoid this line of thinking, it's not helpful or healthy.  You did awesome.  If there's something you can learn from, try and find it, but most likely there isn't and you shouldn't dwell on it.

Well I claim it now.
I didn't vote because I don't give the government, that forces people to pay taxes or forces them into a cage at gun point and kills more people than any individual by paying otherwise good people to kill in the military and police force (the military is actually controlled by the UN at this point), legitimacy. Government is a religious cult.

Calls on ICLN
sold 26.5C 11/13 against my bags so I assume it'll hit 30 next week. Note that the same price movement wouldn't happen if I actually bought the same call.

I really need to stop calling covered calls on shit I know is going to moon.
I‚Äôm seeing an influx of newbie questions in here. Possible correlation with weed stock pump?

Damn it i hate when the logic ninjas jump out of the places I didn't even know existed...   

My firm confidence is now shriveling like a spent dick.
Oh lawd
This is what I paid for it months ago. I sold it a few times to free up capital for daytrades and always ended up buying it again later in the day but it made me miss out on half of the profits. Then it crashed hard and took at least 20% of my portfoilio worth with it. Then Battery day took another 20%. I hope it goes back to $34 like it was premarket on last earnings report.

Agree with you, i made a mistake by flipping with Tesla calls on ele eve and it turned out to be a disaster, so RH is prompting with pattern day trader warning, now I am back to where I was but still will hold for a while.
Is it a put or a call, a 124p is in the money and will make u a profit, a 125c prob wont be in the money and will expire worthless

implied vol on all the weed stocks is crazy high right now, good opportunity to write covered calls way higher and still earn decent premium to reduce your cost base, i got back 25% of my capital and still get to participate up to 4x return on Sundial (bought at $0.3/share, wrote $1 Call for $0.12/contract)
I hear Drilldo Baggins coming
Thanks. Yeah got greedy on last spike, could have sold it -20% or so. But def gonna rid of this thing sometime in next 2-3 weeks, I think after election is over on a green week it can get close to 130
What would be completely insane is the 20x bags I'm holding of dumpster fire HEMP for the last 3 years going green lol.

[deleted]
That's actually not what I am saying. I'm saying that I just simply do not like the candidate that's probably going to run the country. I have many reasons one being the fact that many people like to over look and that's the BLATANT racism by Biden. You can deny it all you want, but telling black people that they really aren't black unless they vote for him, a white haired old ass waspy rich white guy is textbook racism. He also referred to inner city kids as super predators and was the creator of some genuine SYSTEMICALLY RACIST bills. He's pushed for the end of Social Security and Medicaire and is just more of the status queue. He ran simply on the premise of "I'm not trump". So to shorten that i just put "fuck biden" sorry I should have elaborated on what I said i guess.
Politics aside that‚Äôs a clean wrap

Historically, yes, but 2020 isn't normal. With all the option buying, VIX has been elevated all year. I could see VIX going as low as 20 to 22, but shorting it now is a fool's play. If it jumps, it's going to 40 easy.

MAGATards: I told you guys Trump's a genius. He planned this all along and he is the master of 64D chess. You've heard Q: Look at the water. That means the watermark.

Yea for real. All my best performing positions by far are all Chinese stocks. I swear all these dumbfuck white people clutching their pearls at the "CCP" and "made in China quality" are what's undervaluing the stock (compared to if it was a white people company) when I buy in then the company eventually becomes too successful to ignore and the stock pumps to an price equivalent to what would happen if they were always an American/Euro company

I voted blue in person, simply because I missed the deadline to request a ballot (and here in the south the USPS fuckery was legitimately concerning at the time).

But it felt really fucking stupid to gather all these people in a pandemic, and I didn't like it.
They have two primary products that are both focused on taking large complicated data sets and making sense of them. One is used for government security and has top secret applications, the other is their newer private sector version. 

For example, a cop can type in someone's license plate number, and palantir's software can pull a pluthera of information about the person. Where that person has been. Who they've been talking to. What they've been buying etc.

According to the CEO, anytime a terrorist is killed in the world, they were most likely found with palantir's software, and then killed with another piece of software they made.

But because of their super specialized skill set and track record with the US government, they have been soaking up tons of contracts with governments all over the place.

Air force drone AI - project maven. US army Distributed Common Ground System.

They recently picked up another AI contract with the US army.

They protect data for a bunch of random science organizations.

They're kind of becoming the go-to source for new custom covid tracking software.

It goes on and on.

The big big question for this stock, is will they be able to take this government software and apply it commercially? Their CEO says that's their new objective.

I've got a ton of my money betting on yes; mostly because of who is running the company. I have full faith in them, their skills and their connections.
This is the way.....
I feel like it might be a dump since trump has been acting a little crazy

I hate IBKR, I sold ACB at $7.4 pre market, wanted to rebuy at $7.1 but low and behold I found out it takes 3 fucking days to get my cash to buy again? WTF

I literally put in an order to buy 2k worth of ACB at $7.1 and it got rejected saying my settled cash is only $200.

What's that even mean, why can't I emidietly access my money after selling a stock, I fucking KNEW ACB was gonna explode today again.üòë

same man i was up 120k and it dwindeled to 60k. Still won but losing is part of the game especially with high risk. Take a break and if you come back in start small with a limit of what you are willing to lose. As you lose keep making the bets smaller and smaller. And as you win keep increasing the bet sizes but never Yolo. No need to worry my friend. We have all lost bigly. I was on the putsss train for a while and then that train reversed itself into my ass. Stay strong

Today wont determine the direction, it's not like that. 

No one here knows where we're going and anyone who says they do is either over confident or lying. They'll point back in time when there were right other times, but with all the retards posting here every day theres bound to be a handful of retards that predict what happens. 

Kinda like if all 2 million + of us guessed the opening price of SPY on monday. Alot of us would be right, but none of us would be right for the right reasons.
YESSSS, I've been diamond handing like 25 calls
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up.
This is my first time here. I'm still learning the rules. Mostly I buy and hold ETFs but decided the odds were too good with ACB.
Not the one in May for sure. Also, no I have no idea how the sector's gonna react if Sleepy claims victory over the weekend
I secretly hate myself so it works out fine
It's not gonna beat, weed sales aren't doing well yet. If you wanna yolo, go ahead, i dont care
No need for a vaccine bro, this shit will end right after elections remember?
Look into Georgia run-offs. Two seats will be up for re-election and with Trump not on the ballots + mail in votes, dems are likely to get it
VIX still has a lot of downside to go. It's normal range is 10-15 and it's currently highly elevated at 25.
News outlets need to call it before happy hour so we can all enjoy our weekends.  Do they really want to work all weekend?

Everyone turning bearish af on acb, Remember that bad earnings are already projected- if forward guidance is good which it very well might be with all the positive news then we might see it jump up again 

Puts aren‚Äôt a terrible idea but they‚Äôre not the free money some of you think they are
My NIO 11/20 $40c are gonna get IV crushed aren‚Äôt they?

VIX always dumps after big events. It will fall much further in the coming weeks (most likely below 20).
I hope they make it to $100 first.
They have my balls in a bag, no doubt
Market goes up rkt goes up. Market goes down rkt goes down. It should stop doing this leading up to earnings but it hasn't yet. Hoping today is the day.
Yeah, true. That‚Äôs how trump used them and their software. Obama used it for finding bin laden. Many other applications for it. At the end of the day pltr is a tool. Just depends on how the administration wants to wield it.

Do the reverse of what you‚Äôre doing now
*please dump*
Any good plays for next week, SPY puts? I feel like whoever wins presidency, stocks will drop its a gut feeling
Man you really bought into that.

Being as vague as possibly to not break any potential nda, we make money off of ALL of those deals. America is fucking amazing dude. We get a piece of everything. Significant pieces.  Even when you steal from America we still profit. 

Don't be stupid. If you seriously think Americans are able to be beaten at business you're hilarious.

You're purposely not benefiting from the way you personally can benefit from Chinese backed companies. That is the definition of idiocy. We laugh at your type.

Well you bought early so no shit you made money. I made $20k yesterday on it sold, bought again at the peak and now I‚Äôm up only 18k from yesterday. 

So I think it‚Äôs perfectly justified to say fuck NIO.
F if you got in all those today

Mango could do something crazy over the weekend which would make Puts a good play, but it could also screw you if the market just doesn't care what he says/does.
It rallied so hard just to be like nah I‚Äôm not feelin it
NIO: goes up 30% in a week

NIO: drops 2% on Friday

There truly is a fucking Trump tweet for everything

https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1102661631568461824
He did but it was 1 contract
trump asking where the military mail-in ballots are

the answer is, they're probably delayed thanks to USPS being defunded

plus, i thought trump wanted to throw out all votes received after nov 3rd? that would include the military vote.
We should beta test rural America with the COVID vaccine.

I made 100% gains last two fridays in a row and am up 2k last two weeks. Looks like Friday‚Äôs are my day.

Nio is just crazy can‚Äôt trade that
Will BABA break 305 next week? I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure about that (unfortunately).
Nahhhhh. You're seeing what you want to see, tho.

$ACB didn't beat earnings, what are you talking about? They missed it horribly last quarter and they haven't reported for this quarter yet. It's on 11/9. Most of these Canadian weed stocks are utter shit. $CGC is one of the few Canadian weed stocks that I like.

What I find to be stupid is that I was blocked from buying puts to hedge my long stonks. The max risk is the cost of the premium in the event of exercise. Ironically, I can sell naked calls and puts, which are are much more risky than buying calls/puts.
God i love holding TTD lol
what party
Damn what if ACB goes to ath in a few years
Face Ripper eod üò§üò§üò§
Good earnings usually doesn‚Äôt do much for stock price after er call. It‚Äôs all about what future guidance they address on the calls. Do they expect a huge increase yoy? Are they targeting new markets? New big products? That‚Äôs what really makes a stock rise after earnings
Spy is in a beautiful bullish pennant. Ready to break out higher today.
Put/Call ratio on SPY is 1.532.   Almost twice as many puts as calls.  This has been the case over the past 10 days.  Do we keep moving higher?
Can you imagine being on the phone 15m to close?

Obama used pltr. Both sides are hawkish nowadays. Mango actually the most peaceful president, in terms of war, that we‚Äôve had in a while.

Either is bullish. I‚Äôd say Biden is slightly more bullish. And whatever elephant runs in 2024 may be slightly more bullish than Biden.
300% IV. We've seen this amount before in HTZ. Puts just don't produce profits in that kind of environment. Call credit spreads would, however
How bad do your shits smell?
Hey and all the luck to you, just be aware the risk, $17k can become $21k or $7k in almost a blink in the situation we are in now. 
Nasdaq average PE ratio now is about 20-30, ZM PE ratio now is 639, or more than 20x the average.
So yes god luck, but watch your back cause no one else will be on this.

A lot has been said about Biden's green policies that'll stoke the values of stocks related to renewable energy. Not a lot being said about how he'll manage the ongoing epidemic.

The most hilarious thing about trumpers ree-ing about mail-in ballots is that *they fucking caused it.*


They all went on Facebook and spammed about masks being a conspiracy and "muh freedom," which caused ronie to rally to ATH, which caused democrats to say "fuck that" when it came to standing in line at a crowded polling place.


These absolute mongoloids didn't care when 200k of their fellow Americans died, but they are now *finally* bitching about the pandemic they accelerated. All it took was for their glorious leader to get fucked by ballots.

No. Historically Dems engage in more conflict than R-tards. Plus they tend to allow american companies to sell more defense tech to other countries that would normally be restricted. They also tend to increase spending in all areas.

Yes. Nothing has changed for them in terms of earnings, they're pricing in policy that won't come about for some time still.

Isn't 23 leaps at 40 something like 25? How much value do you expect them to pack on in two years? 30, 60, 100?
We live in the real world scenario. 

Why can't they do the count where anyone can watch? Gotta go to the Supreme Court to keep observers out. "Oopsie", I got caught adding enough spurious votes to swing the election, but it was an accident and that's the only time it's happened (where I got caught).

If Biden's victory was so sure, surely there wouldn't need to be a concerted effort to keep the process secret or invent fake votes. Transparent victory > extremely sus process.

I just sold a cash covered put and have no idea what to do now. Why did Fidelity approve me for lvl3 options.

if you want to sell covered calls do it on a higher price stock or one that has high IV

Had the same thought today. But also yesterday. And Wendesday. And Tuesday. And lost money.

Weren't the dems crying full on in the lead up to the election with the removal of mailboxes and so on? Now it's all "yer, mail system is fine, in your face muddafucker!". Sportsmanship goes both ways.

At first I thought we were discussing reality. Now I see we're dealing with Q levels of derangement. I sure hope you're wrong, but I'm also highly confident that you have no clue what you're talking about.
Fellas CGC earnings are Monday. This could be good or bad, so I moved my CGC position into MJ and feel a bit more comfortable. I don't want earnings getting in the way of this Biden pump.
Lol sure buddy, none of this will ever happen, the Democratic party doesn't want to abolish 2A, it's only a small portion of their base. If Biden ran on this policy, I wouldn't have been surprised if he lost Cali. They will literally throw away all their chances of holding any power by running on even the first steps of piecemealing these changes in.

You can't make this shit up.

I've made 10% on my account using only theta plays because of the IV crush today.
There's a grace period after the election to receive mail in ballots. During this time the ballots will trickle in. Then there's the inspecting of the envelopes (tampering), opening, sorting and finally the counting of them. 

Even the simple act of folding a ballot can extend the counting time quite a lot.
Bro you are a god
Close, that new CEO is inexperienced and something will happen

okay?

You know what a profitable company will do in two years (continue to make a profit). Boring.

But an unprofitable company could be anything in two years. It could be bankrupt, could be acquired, it could even turn a profit!
the key, as all radical policy changes, is to bring on the changes piecemeal. we will numb the populace by slowly bending their views of societal norms, while we secure more control of all aspects of the government, both federal and state. when the day comes that we propose the abolishment of the 2nd amendment, it will only seem like a natural thing to do to everyone

Well looks like Biden will pull it off. Can‚Äôt wait to get to learn about my white privilege in the mandatory critical race theory training that I‚Äôm sure we will all get to have in our workplaces. Looking forward to paying more in taxes and thankfully now we will no longer prevent the millions upon millions poor suffering people from third world shitholes from coming here and getting on welfare and utilizing our social services while not paying taxes and voting Democrat in elections without any ID. Thankfully we can also expect tons of new environmental restrictions and regulations on businesses that will assuredly slow economic growth and exacerbate inequality as well. Biden‚Äôs America is gonna be great.

Oh boy is it ever!üòç
Remember when he said, "Will you shut up man?" lol
With in person voting a person fills out a form and puts it into a machine. But with mail there needs to be volunteers to open the mail, make sure it was filled out correctly, flatten the ballots and then feed it into the counting machine. That's just my understanding of it. I could easily be wrong ü§≠

Crazy instrument right here:

SEDG issued a $632.5 MM in 2025 convertible bonds at a conversion price of $277.80 paying 0%. It was issued at a discount with an effective interest rate at 2.1%.

Since it pays no interest, it will always trade at a discount unless the conversion price is hit. Literally a call option or your money back lol.

For anyone wondering if they should go long on ACB after a 75% day

[www.stocksplithistory.com/?symbol=ACB](https://www.stocksplithistory.com/?symbol=ACB)

TL;DR: You invest 10k in 2014, it hits a high of ~180k in 2018 (legalization year).

If you held the whole way through, you'd barely be up.

After a 75% day...

The profits that you‚Äôre thinking this play that you mentioned will produce are already seen in the contract value. So if you do end up actually executing and you immediately sell the shares you bought, your net gains will be zero (from this play, vs just selling your call) because that difference in price between the strike price and the market value had already been added to your call value. No one really ever executes unless you want to average down your price or something. Keep in mind for the call to be worth anything at expiry, it has to be above the ‚Äúbreak even price‚Äù

Eh I don't think people are pumping it right now for the ER, so not sure how much that will impact it. Best they can do is talk hopeful of a likely new administration and forecasting under that. Get the hype.... Then we can sell the news....

Edit: even without federal legalization, a few more states legalized it themselves, so new markets for these companies.
This is me. I yolod 2k on acb yesterday and today. Made a measly 1k. Small gains.
I‚Äôm planning to flip the calls shortly after earnings, not sure what I‚Äôll do with the cash tbh, been considering upgrading my X5 for a new Macan GTS. 

As far as the shares that I hold? I‚Äôm LONG Palantir, I‚Äôll be holding for years. 

I think the stock is largely disconnected from the overall market, if we see a crash and PLTR 2X+, I‚Äôll consider peeling some off and buying bargains. Something like WFC at $12, JPM at $60, etc. 

Very situational however. Plan is to hold for the long term for now.

Helpful tip to beginners under PDT rule. Out of day trades and want to lock in some GAINZ?

Assuming gains on calls: sell calls one strike further OTM to make vertical spreads (lock in some gains). You could buy the short calls back later if you want or close the whole spread later for what it is worth.

You could make a box (lock it all), but I think beginners might fuck this up and/or get assigned on low extrinsic contracts.

I think weed stocks are level until a Biden win is declared. ACB has a lot more room to go up, if you consider what it has been valued at in the past

CMPS
Are you talking about the bill that our nation's military and McCain (and 21 other senators) did not support because they were concerned the military would not be able to retain personnel? Did you read McCain's response to (then) Senator Obama when he called out McCain for not supporting the bill? Here, let me post it for you so you can read more than just the headline. McCain threw down some well deserved shade on Obama for saying he didn't support the troops.

>"It is typical, but no less offensive that Senator Obama uses the Senate floor to take cheap shots at an opponent and easy advantage of an issue he has less than zero understanding of. Let me say first in response to Senator Obama, running for President is different than serving as President. The office comes with responsibilities so serious that the occupant can't always take the politically easy route without hurting the country he is sworn to defend. Unlike Senator Obama, my admiration, respect and deep gratitude for America's veterans is something more than a convenient campaign pledge. I think I have earned the right to make that claim.

>"When I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house in New London, Connecticut, and a Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. My father immediately left for the submarine base where he was stationed. I rarely saw him again for four years. My grandfather, who commanded the fast carrier task force under Admiral Halsey, came home from the war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. I grew up in the Navy; served for twenty-two years as a naval officer; and, like Senator Webb, personally experienced the terrible costs war imposes on the veteran. The friendships I formed in war remain among the closest relationships in my life. The Navy is still the world I know best and love most. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home to the country they loved so well.

>"But I am running for the office of Commander-in-Chief. That is the highest privilege in this country, and it imposes the greatest responsibilities. It would be easier politically for me to have joined Senator Webb in offering his legislation. More importantly, I feel just as he does, that we owe veterans the respect and generosity of a great nation because no matter how generously we show our gratitude it will never compensate them fully for all the sacrifices they have borne on our behalf.

>"Senators Graham, Burr and I have offered legislation that would provide veterans with a substantial increase in educational benefits. The bill we have sponsored would increase monthly education benefits to $1500; eliminate the $1200 enrollment fee; and offer a $1000 annually for books and supplies. Importantly, we would allow veterans to transfer those benefits to their spouses or dependent children or use a part of them to pay down existing student loans. We also increase benefits to the Guard and Reserve, and even more generously to those who serve in the Selected Reserve.

>"I know that my friend and fellow veteran, Senator Jim Webb, an honorable man who takes his responsibility to veterans very seriously, has offered legislation with very generous benefits. I respect and admire his position, and I would never suggest that he has anything other than the best of intentions to honor the service of deserving veterans. Both Senator Webb and I are united in our deep appreciation for the men and women who risk their lives so that the rest of us may be secure in our freedom. And I take a backseat to no one in my affection, respect and devotion to veterans. And I will not accept from Senator Obama, who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform, any lectures on my regard for those who did.

>"The most important difference between our two approaches is that Senator Webb offers veterans who served one enlistment the same benefits as those offered veterans who have re-enlisted several times. Our bill has a sliding scale that offers generous benefits to all veterans, but increases those benefits according to the veteran's length of service. I think it is important to do that because, otherwise, we will encourage more people to leave the military after they have completed one enlistment. At a time when the United States military is fighting in two wars, and as we finally are beginning the long overdue and very urgent necessity of increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps, one study estimates that Senator Webb's bill will reduce retention rates by 16%.

>"Most worrying to me, is that by hurting retention we will reduce the numbers of men and women who we train to become the backbone of all the services, the noncommissioned officer. In my life, I have learned more from noncommissioned officers I have known and served with than anyone else outside my family. And in combat, no one is more important to their soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen, and to the officers who command them, than the sergeant and petty officer. They are very hard to replace. Encouraging people not to choose to become noncommissioned officers would hurt the military and our country very badly. As I said, the office of President, which I am seeking, is a great honor, indeed, but it imposes serious responsibilities. How faithfully the President discharges those responsibilities will determine whether he or she deserves the honor. I can only tell you I intend to deserve the honor if I am fo rtunate to receive it, even if it means I must take politically unpopular positions at times and disagree with people for whom I have the highest respect and affection.

>"Perhaps, if Senator Obama would take the time and trouble to understand this issue he would learn to debate an honest disagreement respectfully. But, as he always does, he prefers impugning the motives of his opponent, and exploiting a thoughtful difference of opinion to advance his own ambitions. If that is how he would behave as President, the country would regret his election."


I personally did not agree with McCain on a lot but he was a man of good character and wasn't afraid to voice his opinion. Not sure if you're remembering that quote because you were an Obama supporter or a Trump supporter but either way you are way off base with your statement.

But why though? Has it ever worked out?
What fathomable forces would cause that? Yes, there will more than likely be a correction from today‚Äôs +75% gain, maybe by Monday down 25%, who knows, but if Biden wins there‚Äôs only positive forces on the market, and ACB has excellent fundamentals, good leadership, and a great positioning for entering the US market.. This will be a $30-$50 stock within a year.

Earnings were this mornings and they beat very well and improved their outlook for 2020 and next year. CEO change wasn't the only news item.

While there is something to be said about the people who voted for Trump, it is worth noting that unseating an incumbent president is a rarity. Trump would have won outright if he just shut the fuck up occasionally. Wall Street turned on him because volatility is a bitch when your an MM. You can pivot on it and make large amounts quickly, but the novelty and unpredictability has worn off. They transferred a shitload of wealth to the top dogs. Now they want things to settle and let it grow. He disenfranchised the military rank and file with some of his comments. He pissed of Arizona by shitting on McCain. He went after Fauci, he downplayed the rona, and he didn‚Äôt disavow white supremacy (which he could‚Äôve done while double speaking support for them.) 
DJT is exactly as he always was: given every conceivable opportunity to succeed, then squandering it. 
This isn‚Äôt a comment on him as a political figure or a GOP rep. Yes, I am not pro trump. Yes, I think his followers are a cult. Yes, I think he‚Äôs bad for America. However, the truth is, he could and should have had this in the bag. Democrats are lucky that Trump still behaved like Trump; taking something handed to him and easy to capitalize on, then running it right into the ground.

I'm also questioning how every county in the state is red, yet the "last minute" ballots are almost ALL blue.

Damn you too, I thought Biden winning would tank the market, Fox kept saying he was a socialist. Everyone was saying he would raise taxs and increase the deficit causing rampant inflation.  /s
CRON will hit $9 today. They announcing The winner and Oregon is throwing a party......oh wait.....nvm
Biden winning with a Republican senate is the best scenario for stonks.  No antitrust, no trade war with China.
A week ago everyone was shitting on this ‚Äúipo flop‚Äù and ‚Äúeveryone hates thiel‚Äù and ‚Äúslow gov contracts‚Äù LOL. 

I bought 2000 shares below $10 and grabbed a bunch of feb calls at $12.5, now up over 200%. 

Enjoy the ride dude.
God I love it.
That is due to the uncivilized and romanticized view towards firearms that has been normalized by our society. everything will be different in the progressive America that we are preparing you for. You will finally be able to feel safe without the need for firearms
Best part about NIO - pandemic proof since China has their shit together with covid and it‚Äôs a Biden friendly stock. With earnings coming up and new preorders opening on 11/7 this shit is going to $50 eom

Your gains must be solid. Congrats! I bought an 84 strike, so I'm ITM. Might sell EoD, I figure there will be a sell-off over the last hour of the trading day.
I feel like march is coming again and soon :( 120k new cases in the US alone yesterday, nearly a 20% increase day over day. Vaccine wont be able to be properly distributed and even then at best will have a 60% success rate. This new mink covid 2.0 might be a real bitch.

Low energy pump
Exactly that. Up 20% this week alone so without some killer guidance I think they fall at least 10%. I recently made an unreasonable amount on calls very quickly, which leads me to believe it‚Äôll pull back because that run up isn‚Äôt based on anything tangible yet. Could totally be wrong, but they asked for a YOLO.

Doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone really wants to sell. Which usually means people are going to buy.
My logic is that a Democrat in office typically isn‚Äôt good for corporations. Thus, markets go down. My theory is that we are over extended in the short term and the solidification of the pres will make markets go down
Man y‚Äôall so dumb. This would literally be a disaster for the markets. Biden winning and dems not taking the senate is the best thing that could‚Äôve happened for the markets. Dems calm down, we get to keep our tax cuts, Corp tax rate stays at 21%, and we prob get a huge stimulus package that‚Äôs hashed out by both parties. Powell prob stays fed chief because there‚Äôs no way they make a change during the pandemic.

Weed stocks are likely gonna tank after earnings as every company does so too late for those. Gold and silver are already up big so don‚Äôt wanna buy at the top on those.

Is there anything that‚Äôs the right play right now?

Let‚Äôs see those gains SQ call holders wow
[deleted]
Lucky you.  The ones I can afford I always ask to reverse, can't stand looking at those faces...
With gains like these we can afford low stop orders and still keep a good return.
Meanwhile in an alternate reality:

"After polling entirely unaffected by stupid bullshit like manual data entry errors apparently swinging a whole state and the Democrat Party going to the Supreme Court to prevent Republicans from even seeing how the votes that have them the election were counted, Joe Biden has won the election. Disappointed Republicans at quoted as saying, 'well shit, we lost. Maybe there's something we can learn from this'. President elect Biden is quoted as saying. 'Hubanubawubada is a human right.' That will clearly soothe the wounds that Biden and his party have left upon this nation for the last four years."

Instead we've got:

"Every contested state stops counting for some reason at the same time. Also there was a whoopsie when the votes that weren't being counted were being entered and Biden accidentally got 150,000 votes that didn't exist. We pinky swear that the only time we got caught was the only time it happened, though! What's that? You want to *watch* us count the ballots? No way, gotta take that shit to the Supreme Court. 

But zirs, zirs, it's OBVIOUS that it's a win for the Democrats. Sure, our projections were wrong (again) by an order of magnitude, and we're happy to call contested states for the Democrats well before the result is certain, but refuse to call states with 100% reporting and a 5% lead for the Republicans, and maybe Trump only needs to win one of four states that are up in the air right now (incidentally where all of the corruption is happening, imagine that), but it's in the bag for Biden. Trust us! There's no shady shit going on at all!

The past four years MSNBC and CNN have probably had the best ratings in their history because of batshit Trump. Biden will be boring and people aren't going to feel the need to have them on for hours on end.

They're gonna milk this as long as fucking possible because the next four years they're going to hemorrhage viewers
I‚Äôm down to my last 17 cents from $10k. What I learned? Taking profits is not only taking profits from the trade, its also depositing those profits to the bank. I was good at locking in profits on trades but what good is locking profits on trades if youll eventually lose it all in another yolo and dont have any withdrawn funds in the bank to fall back on?

Also the whole economy thing.  I dont want to sacrifice the economyjust to slow the spread....and I'm immunocompromised.  

Where I differ from other people is I want the person making that decision to be competent and take his advisors seriously, so that we can address the pandemic with earnest while also insulating the economic impact on the American people.  Trump's approach, denying it existed or that anything needed to be done about it, made both problems far worse.

Yeah it's tough to figure out the political game theory, but with it looking like Biden will edge out Trump in Georgia, McConnell doesn't want to go into that election being the stubborn stimulus stopper because he's fucking cheap.

McConnell would rather concede a lot of room on stimulus to look like the cooperting legislative hero that got it done to sell to Georgians. If he blockades the stimulus because he wants something meager that will be a huge selling point for the runoffs.

The saving grace for McConnell is retaining the Senate. Plus, if they lose the Senate in the runoffs the stimulus will be bigger so he'll lose anyway.

If Republicans keep control of the senate, there is no incentive whatsoever for them to give anything to Biden. Especially stimulus. They will need to run on a devastated economy in 2022. Stimulus helps their opponents.

I'm not surprised given this is Reddit.  Probably because I said "crazy" when talking about socialistic ideas.  I hate to stereotype, but I'm guessing the downvotes came from kids who don't own much to begin with.

Oh well though - my options printed Yuge this week regardless.
That would be rad.  Not happening lol
SNDL
Chances we spike before close on FOMO for all of the speculation for next week?
Idk, I‚Äôm glad I escaped with a profit. That shit was stressing me out
230 m vol and stagnant. Just pump so I can get out nio. Wtf
Hell yeah. Now im just debating whether ill cash out for now and wait what happens next week
If someone recommends me a 5 to 10 bagger, I will send them 500 USD. Show me what you've got guys. Just lost a 3rd of my account being a bear and I'm done with that life
Of course this would happen - I've been waiting to be able to w/d because I scored a decent win the past couple days and having the money on hand is important, BUT I was so close to buying SQ calls for next week when seeing it only up 4%. I have no idea what they'd be worth now vs. at that point, but fucking hell.

Economy will be stagnant for the 4 years.

1. When you tax big corporations, they just pack up and leave. Meaning thousands/millions of jobs losses 

2. With his strict lockdowns and Covid regulations he will bury majority of small businesses in the ground. 

3. Entrepreneurial spirit will be tarnished because what‚Äôs the point of becoming rich when a 1/4 is taking away from taxes.

4. I hope you have a good paying job because gas is going through up to 4/5 a gallon.

5. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about
the fact that trump almost won while completely denying the pandemic was a threat shows you how stupid this country is
On the dip this morning. Theta is definitely a concern, but I believe volatility will go up on these end of day and into Monday as this market is about to pop to the upside and the easiest way for the algos to move SPY is through tech.

ACB is a fucking embarrassment to the Canadian industry.

This stock was sub-$1 *before* their reverse split.

And I've heard that their weed sucks dick.
A book
Monday for sure.
you should've said it before you went up 50%
That's like 7k in single position that will expire in two months. You are either rich and have money to burn, or you have gone full retard.

With the same money you can buy 15 calls for 11/2021 $15 strike. PLTR is going to the moon, but you don't know if it will happen in the next two months; they have not announced ER yet.
Lol Biden is a gun owner.  He encouraged people to have guns while he was VP.

Do you decide to just rip 150 bucks up for no reason?

His contracts were contingent upon like a 40% boost in the stock price, and it actually happened. In the other 9,999 parallel universes, his $150 is consumed by the void.

Part of building a great economy is also ensuring things like your pandemic response is actually fucking coherent so it isn't all washed away because you think masks are for pussies.
Having no delta would mean that no matter where the stock price moves the contract value would stay the same. No gamma means the rate of change of delta would also not change. None of this is possible
Boy it‚Äôs true what they say about Russian women huh? Either a 9 or a 2.

It also makes some less populated areas have better risk-adjusted returns for stocks. Most are in the Russell backwaters, but I've been finding some with increased IV but about the same HV that makes selling puts or covered calls pretty nice. Like for example, no one's going to be rushing to get in or out of Otter Tail, a Russell Material, if there's a run to the door for S&P Tech, but it gets to benefit from the general increased premiums. I bet there's opportunities in healthcare, but I don't know enough to play
Pls hold until next Thursday NET. So I can sell you.
SBUX and AMD. One I make money on the other I lose money on. Going to keep trying on both.

When is this monumental dump taking place that I keep hearing about all week long?
Depending on your financial situation, you probably should?  

Just dumping it all in an index fund is going to yield you more than 0.5% interest or whatever the bank is paying.

There are some cannabis stocks people are sleeping on. Not going to say which because people don't like to mention anything under 5B market cap but it has room to move and the calls are stupid cheap.

ACB for 150% ....  shoulda stayed for another 50%
You‚Äôre welcome
ACB NOW GO
I sold off $185 SQ I picked yesterday, still holding $200 calls for March and $75AMD leaps. Today was Borat level of Great Success. Very nice.
Buy some roller skates and just go
I'm happy with Cresco Labs, which is actually profitable unlike Cronos which is total shit. It's up but not much. It will moon after next earnings call, just as it did right after its most recent one.
I wont complain im just glad im getting some tendies for once lol. Wish i wouldve had more to pump in but whatever

MM and algos will buy it all up before you can even open your RH app. 10 bagger if you fomo early enough and don't get fucked by chance.

I like VFF a lot. I've followed weed stocks for a while now and they seem great. It doesnt get as much traction as like acb (for right now) but it's also less likely to completely collapse like acb is almost guaranteed to do. Imo, VFF and HEXO are good weed stock holds.

What part of that earnings, and imminent stimmy coming through SQ payment made you want to do that? Here I was being annoyed at selling early at 195 lol
Basically back to pre pandemic volatility levels which is ridiculous. Vix low look out below. See y‚Äôall in Valhalla
Would you do it again? It was a calculated risk. Had the coin flipped the other way you would've made 100k easy. I argue that taking this kind of risk is worth it because in the end all we have to lose is a few months of work vs. potentially driving a lambo at 25.

&#x200B;

With the way the market is right now I would say there is no need for insane risk though. Just margin your account 60-80% literally buy any tech stock, come back in a month or two and and you're rich.
Do you think it can hit 226 EOM I really need it to...

I‚Äôm $24k away from my goal. So close it feels like.
The democrats simply wouldn‚Äôt have held a hearing because it would have given the judge a shot at nomination. Thinking otherwise is a perfect example of hyperpartisanship.

Once again, the republicans didn‚Äôt modify anything in the constitution. It gives them the choice to either have the hearing or not. I find it ironic that you accuse me of making a false equivalency when you do exactly that in asking for a ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù example when the premise of your question is wrong.

This didn't age well

Yes, 100% agree. Every move is amplified due to the amount of money sloshing around in a few areas of the markets. I do think it could culminate in a major crash if you get into a sustained downtrend though.

you keep the option premium, but loose the shares at the strike price. if you want to keep the shares you have to buy back the option.
Apparently keeping people locked in and giving them nothing to has really encouraged them to vote at unusual level

Just rewatched that futurama episode!

I lost $5k because I went all in on ACB earlier this week right before the dip. I sold all out. I would be driving away in my Ferrari right now if I held.

House buying never slowed down.
With the 2 Georgia Senate seats looking like they're headed to a run-off, Mitch's Senate Majority status is at risk. He has incentive to try and get a stimulus that works for the people of Georgia.

I'm sure he was comfy when Perdue appears to be comfortably above 50% but it's dipped with nothing really left to count.

I'd actually expect a stimulus by end of year. Even if Trump wants to be  dick and veto it, McConnell can get his fellow senators to override the veto. He's gotten everything he could want and more from Trump so won't have problems overriding a lame duck.

Buying the dip üî•
not the worst idea.

Ive never done it, but if you look at the history of VXX/VIX, it doesnt really sustain volatility long term. VIX can go from 15 to 70 in 2 weeks during an economic crisis but it bleeds down to the 20s and 30s SUPER fast, and always after a spike.

Next time VIX spikes up massively, im just going to short it on a 4-6 month time table. too bad thats like once a year or in a decade deal
The top is in boy
not so fast buddy


two run offs

senate could go 50-50


VP would decide ties
And people have been talking about it since IPO lead up.

What we‚Äôre talking about is the Overton Window. The window doesn‚Äôt really give a fuck about your opinions on said policies but rather mainstream acceptance of them. I‚Äôm starting to think you just threw that term out there without knowing what it actually means, as many people tend to do.

Everything I listed has become more politically acceptable over Trump‚Äôs term, shifting it closer to the center of the window.

Wealth taxes ‚Äî Proposed plans by California legislature and Bernie to literally tax wealth. This is different from property tax, and indicates a shift to the left in the window given public support.

Reparations ‚Äî Increasing amount of elected officials coming out in support of these, indicating a shift to the left in the window.

Our elected officials have little to do with the Overton window itself, but rather they either conform to it or eventually get voted out.

If you‚Äôre going to throw around terms like this, you should actually learn what they mean first.

Ah gotcha haven't even looked at it before today didn't see that
I bought them at $15 and sold at $13 after they downgraded a rating

[deleted]
I have a million safer things I‚Äôd do, but if your goal is a 10 bagger, I‚Äôd look at a smaller value stock that‚Äôs been oversold and buy calls around into 2021.

This might sound completely ridiculous, but putting it all on Zynga 3/19/21 10c might be a 10 bagger.

But that‚Äôs not the way I tend to look at trades.

If you had more money to play with, I think some defense industry stocks like Raytheon and leidos are good plays.

Also think rocket will continue running to earnings.

NIO and the EV sector has run so much already.
I bought apple puts for 104 last Friday thinking this election would drop it. Rip
Why don't you just put 300 on options if you already plan on losing it...
The 22s aren't bad but the 23s are too high. If they're successful and things are progressing 2023 will get priced in by 2022 IMO. They're high profile news moves quick regarding Virgin and Branson is really really high profile.

You are not correct. Getting the FFL isn‚Äôt that bad, except the ATF hasn‚Äôt approved a home FFL in over a year. Meaning we need a facility of X square feet. Hurray for more rent.

Plus 200$ tax stamps are in Biden‚Äôs plan for not only magazines, but guns in circulation. I‚Äôm not an idiot as the above commenter thinks. If it was as easy as he thinks, everyone would do it.

SQ will touch $200 in the next 15 min
My casino trip was canceled do to covid among my usual buddies.  I've got about 300 bucks that I've already budgetted as a loss.  How can I go about just dumping it into a stock on such a low scale? I don't intend for this to be a long term investment or to grow - as I said, it was earmarked for casino trip so it's lost as far as I'm concerned.

Is there an app or website that will just let me easily put 100 bucks into a company and see how it does over the next 2-3 months?   I tried searching and all the top results were instructing me to hire a stock broker and make a plan or invest info group funds.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks! Admidst the downvotes and 'lol' messages and pm's I got a few people giving me the answer I was looking for at least.
Never doubt SQ
Yeah - I was reading how they have already separated the votes that arrived post NOV-3 just in case. All the mail in votes have overwhelmingly been pro Joe Biden. These idiots live in a false reality.
I pumped my PEV at lunch so it might too
/r/smallstreetbets or /r/babystreetbets 

Go there, don't post this here
Are you sure we‚Äôre dumping already?
What?  How could a stock rocketing up 69% in a day possibly have a pull back?!?
Sorry bro.

Physically replicated ETF's was actually the right terminology. 

According to bogleheads like groups in my country these are more to be trusted than synthetically replicating etf's. 

Examples are vwce, iwda, emim, etc. 
These etf's are not exceptional. Just very diversified, world wide, good tracking because of large trading volumes, and low TER. 
Profits will not be large, instead these financial instruments relay on dependability and compounding interest to get good returns. In other words, long term investment. 

The argument that is made is of course valid. 
I invested in these etf's because i trusted the expertise of the local fora and not because i looked at the underlying stocks. 
On the other hand outperforming the index is quite a feat for professionals of the stock market. 
The ETF is said to be a good tool for the passive investor that likes to have slow gains and appreciates the time to do something else than looking at stocks and judging companies.

Edit: i have found it be very interesting. Looking at stocks. Evaluating what i believe to be good and not good. 
I think i like to be an investor that invests in the greater good. That's why some socially responsible ETF's sound good to me, even though they may underperform compared to the index. 
Perhaps an investment in a better world is a good investment in the long term.
Imagine if we as a collective invested in green initiatives or initiatives that through education and healthcare helped perform a country or the world to its optimum.
Wow why tho

Conservatives before the election: "Liberals are commies and are literally not human! They should be rounded up and killed or jailed at least"

Conservatives now that their daddy is going to lose: "Hey guys let's be civil and all get along ok?"
They do not. They just buy into the lies they are told

No problem!  Addiction is a serious problem and it's about damn time this country starts to wake up and start changing how we view and handle it!  Addicts aren't inherently bad people, but addiction makes people do bad things.  Treating addicts as humans rather than criminals is a huge step in working towards curbing addiction rates and getting to the root of the problem.
Damn, goodluck

*Inverse WSB activated*
Are you Rip Van Winkle?
Just trimmed a bunch of my tech stonks about an hour ago

What do I do with $30k now
A couple things:

1) Most of Trump's law suits are frivolous. 
- The infamous "bordered up wall that kept watchers out" of the vote count room is utter BS. In the very room they were trying to "watch" Trump lawyers already admitted their campaign watchers were in the room all day, democrats were in there, and 3rd party state officials were in there, even independent party watchers were in there lol the people outside who were trying to get in were EXTRA watchers the room couldn't safely occupy so they were told to keep a distance. 
- The cries that Pennsylvania are accepting votes after November 3rd...has so many legal holes I don't want to go over them all here, I will just say LESS THAN 10k votes came in after Nov. 3rd, ALL of which have been Seperated from the rest 1.5 MILLION legal votes that came on or BEFORE Nov 3rd. Losing those 10k votes will ABSOLUTELY NOT change the outcome of PA election results. 

2) The election is over. Trump lost. You have to get over this and move on. In no circumstances will he remain President for a 2nd term.
probably bc more diversification of apps n stuff. w the food delivery services they acquired
Is this the best weekly rally Spy has ever had?
I prefer the term *deflecting the Conservative penchant for self victimization by projecting their own insecurities about being crybabies all the time onto political opponents*

These people love to talk about states rights and the electoral college but are freaking out that these votes are being counted ‚Äúlate‚Äù.

News flash: the REAL election hasn‚Äôt even happened yet. What happened on Tuesday was every state started the process of determining based on THEIR OWN LAWS AND PROCEDURES how they want to apportion their ELECTORAL COLLEGE votes on 12/14. The ACTUAL day of the election. 

What happens between 11/3-12/13 is just the states deciding how to vote on 12/14. Nothing more, nothing less.

You're using that fuzzy word again: "Blocked." I think the Democrats would have held a hearing based on every other instance of SC nomination. I think they may or may not have confirmed the nominee by considering their merits, based on all past examples of such a thing happening, and they would have done so according to the legal process.

I ask again, I would like a "Both sides" example. Show me an insurance where Democrats have modified the constitutionally mandated process.

This rally is simple election hype.

The market either gets super worried over who is next president or super hyped up, this scenario is the latter.

Not to mention that a blue president and red senate means a stalemate between blue team and red team, and that means nothing is going to happen in the foreseeable future (besides stimulus), and that means stability, and that means a predictable future.

Market doesn‚Äôt like an unpredictable, uncertain future.

Plus, I already sold my calls retard, this hype is going to end eventually.

Better cash out before I enter risky territory and suffer a potential loss.
nah that's just the cope you smell
I just bought $6 puts for 01/15. This going to be a huge rug pull.

SSSS,  30% of their market cap is coursera and have $60 million of PLTR still. No brainer.
Dude you just made me remember the keygen music that shit slapped when I was a 12 year old haxor

What is the bear case for SNAP I'm honestly curious? This sub has been bearish on SNAP since its IPO. Is it the Saudis selling us puts?

It's a triple top, guys, that's even more catastrophic than a double top! Buy the puts I'm selling! Do it now! No questions, only buying!

Someone less retarded than me: what is causing this ACB pump? Biden win is good okay, but why ACB in particular. There's been no news, no earnings, no deals, is this all in anticipation of Monday's earnings?

While not the perfect scenario if Democrats don‚Äôt win the Senate, there is absolutely no doubt that Biden will sign executive orders, ask states to consider local legislation, and have propositions from the House made (even if they can‚Äôt pass the Senate) favorable for the US cannabis industry. Until there are enough restrictions lifted for there to be US-based growers, Canadian growers will be the only place to dump money into, and money will be dumped.

DANK would be the best ticker.
It's a leveraged product built for short-term plays... there's a natural decay built-in which is why the all-time chart looks the way it does.
What's the big deal if ballots arrive late as long as you put them in mail by the day of the election? Are people really more obsessed with winning than giving the voters an actual say in the election? I think we know the answer to that.
LMAO @ ALL THE CUCKS WHO THOUGHT NIO WAS DONE

Lol, I sleep well at night knowing that idiots like you solidify all of my long positions. betting against the us economy is the single dumbest thing you can do with your money.
This is what we‚Äôre here for. Fuck you.
yes to a degree, but its been the republicans lately who have a massive hard on for going after big tech it seems.
Well, they have been democratic priorites for decades (not the border thing, Obama tried to pass a bill but the repub senate shot it down), they just haven't been reported on fox as likely to happen.  
I'm listing the things that mango ACTUALLY FUCKING DID, you're listing the policy ideas floating around the democratic party that still need to go through both houses of congress and make economic sense via the treasury.
  
And reparations aren't happening, Wealth tax already exists (property tax), increasing capital gains taxes is fine there are too many loopholes already, Socialized medicine will at worst be similar to the German/Dutch models (which are private insurers but are heavily regulated to the point that they are practically government controlled).
  
As to border crossings being decriminalized, you mean something like a North American Schengen zone? Because if you can make that work that's a really smart move
They still havent figured out that all PA-votes so far have were received before Nov 3rd

So even if SCOTUS throws out post-Nov 3 votes, they still lose

I swear these fuckers are the most uninformed & unaware people out there. It's almost hilarious how out of touch they are with reality
I think so too. That means higher taxes are coming to 400k households near you soon ;).

The issue with PA is that the states Supreme Court extended the deadline, which I guess that power is only given to the state legislators, as that‚Äôs what is in the constitution.  

This seems to be the only case that I‚Äôve heard that sounds reasonable, so it probably won‚Äôt matter since Biden will get to 270 without PA.

Yup but the market does the opposite of what u think

NIO is not going to stay down. They just put out battery news
As someone who wants to buy some NiO why now after it just had a crazy run?  What makes it likely to continue this run?

nah, the big money got what it wanted, no new tax laws + stimulus

your best bet is to wait for a small drop and then put as much money as possible in.

There's a lot of money waiting on the sidelines

Okay, so why do folks think the Market is going to boom even further when Biden is officially declared the winner?  Everyone knows he's won it already looking at the vote totals...this runup is more like "Buy the Rumor, sell the News" kind of an event, imo, especially after the INSANE surge in stocks that's already starting to plateau.... Meanwhile, Mango ain't gonna leave and is actively planning a fucking coup....  And of course, we have Covid exponentially surging and Stimulus is back to smol pp status under McConnell........  I doubled down on UVXY Calls now that they're cheap AF, and picked up a ton more SPXU and SQQQ Calls, this country is going down the fucking shitter.....

Sounds like your relatives dont know jack shit about the market, theyd be perfect here.
Talked to an Italian girl at Starbucks‚Äôs. Italy=pizza=tomato sauce=red=buy puts
If neither dies, resigns, goes to prison, or declines greatly, I guarantee we get Biden-Trump II in 2024. Even if Trump truly believes it was corrupt, it‚Äôs too hard to undo. Running again makes too much sense while republicans push for election reform in the meantime.
The button that said vote for all Republicans/Democrats with one click was no longer there - they got it removed
gottem
The state Supreme Court already ruled on that earlier and the federal court has made it pretty clear they dont want to touch this.
I anticipate profit taking before the bell
Wiki had puts this Monday
going higher next week, should hold
Thats because you bought it. Just sell it so it goes back up lol

11/9 SPY calls
That would be my guess. I think the election is going to be called either later tonight or over the weekend. The government will officially be hung and business ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù will remain.

Papa China agrees!
The window has two sides to it. On other side is:

Green New Deal, reparations, wealth tax, increasing capital gains taxes on some people, completely socializing medicine, proposed decriminalization of border crossings etc.

All of these ideas have become more socially acceptable to talk about than they were four years ago.

The democrats have shifted left, the republicans have shifted in...I honestly don‚Äôt even know what direction, but definitely not towards traditional conservatism.

I've been long on BCRX for a while now as well. Just with Berotralstat, this company is seriously undervalued but add on a possible short squeeze as well as Galidesivir as a potential tool against Covid?!

Nio volume is through the roof. I could see it settling around 40-41. Every single day this week except for today there has been a major positive announcement for NIO. I expect a consolidation up into earnings. Everyone expects NIO earnings to be really good. What I think will send NIO green and up will be the talk about future plans and goals being set by the company
Its the MMs trying to pin it at $40. Those gap ups are probably retail buying the dip

This thing should continue its run up next week tho with earnings coming up and whatnot

Who holding weed calls over the weekend? And what company?
üìâ
They were given 17 years of contracts from the government that enabled them to build data mining, ai and machine learning technology that rivals google.

For example, google walked on an airforce drone AI contract called Project Maven, citing ethical concerns. Palantir took their place.

Palantir recently won a bid among 999 other competitors to assist in developing AI software for the US army.

It goes on and on and on. They specialize in taking huge amounts of data and making sense of it.

Now they are taking all this technology to the private sector and these guys are connected AF, so it will likely be pretty easy for them to pick up fortune 500 contracts left right and centre.

One of their cofounders, Peter Thiel, has direct ties to facebook and spacex, as one of the startup angel investors for both of them.

Thiel and Karp are also on the steering committee of the bilderberg group. That means they rub elbows with and get a meeting with whoever the fuck they want.

This company COULD be a HUGE deal.

Interesting thing about this scene in WoWS is that this is the point where the movie deviates from what really happened. In the movie he stays on at his firm to create a more climatic ending. The real Jordan Belford actually did step down during this meeting and the time period between this and when he was arrested was more of a slow burn, with more evidence being incrementally found against him.
Why would they do this? It's just embarassing.

BET too. Do they have options on BET?
Frothy, it's always frothy. Shutup.
Nio if u don‚Äôt close above 42 I‚Äôm gonna have a shitty weekend ü•∫
It‚Äôs so you can buy the dip.

Yep, my 11/20 are completely worthless.  Unless some insane shit happens, looks like it's going to slow bleed into the 18-19 area, fucking insane
Yeah, its probably a safer play to wait until after earnings.
Haha
Next nio
$90 by end of next week, book it.
We all know 99% of those tacticool neckbeards won't do shit besides shitpost on /pol/

If they wanted to start a civil war they would've done so by now, but they're all a bunch of pussies. Instead they'll sit at home fuming at Fox News
Exactly. No seems to care about rona now. It's only going to keep increasing from here.
Top is in
My mistake I thought you couldn‚Äôt, I guess I need to call and haven then unlock it. I know there‚Äôs no margin except for when you are waiting for money to clear.
lol, I guess you read all his comments? But, Joe is bullish. No way he passes all the stuff that are too far right. I think he's the closest middle of the road guy we have seen in 4 years. Just saying cause my NIO position is up nicely, so Trump better not screw this up...
Take the day off with some credit spreads?
No, I‚Äôm eager for a government that doesn‚Äôt discriminate against people for their religious beliefs. And I‚Äôd hope that the citizens would also believe in that basic human rights

SPY today is fucking boring. Someone make it do something.
6000 birds in the hand are worth more than 22000 birds in the bush
volume on XPEV and NIO dried up.  Big money pulled out.  It's not gonna happen for 11/6 holders that didn't sell earlier.  I'd say just sell now before your 50% loss goes to 80% in a couple hours.
Nevada kept the betting markets open for as long as they could to get the Trump support/Biden hedger money for as long as possible.
If you believe in affordability you should really vote for a system that includes universal and free at source health care - your system is garbage
Totally fine with this, it‚Äôs behaving in typical NIO fashion. There‚Äôs going to be rise up in the afternoon.
Everyone loading up on NIO??
It's burned a lot of ppl over the last couple months ppl don't wanna fuck with it.
Holding on to what, contracts that expire in 2 months?
Thinking about buying NIO 50c for next week or the week after

Guys! He bought calls. Dump eet
For all the weed I smoke I‚Äôm such a dumbass for not playing aurora or canopy
Nope, I have no position with GM. Might buy in if the price drops low enough from the recent rally.
SAP & INTC have low IV and good for leaps
They wont be profitable until 2029.
Sold out already
covid disappear to the media
What made you buy it? Do you think earnings will be good?
Yes sir !
COVID is old news
I'm numb to it after I paper handed zm earnings calls that would have made 58k. 

Sell if up good. I wouldnt necessarily recomend nio but I dont see too much more upside for acb to risk money and profits

Earnings are always bad for weed stocks, that‚Äôs why they are all down like 90% since highs

Not today asshole. Wish you would've bought now huh
You sold me. I‚Äôm in
Do you know what happened after last earnings?
So now that elections are almost over is anyone going to point out we broke our record and had 118k cases yesterday?
I sold it at a loss, bought it at $2 and sold when it fell to $1.9.
Joke‚Äôs on you
Finally erased my September losses. Am I gonna realize these gains? Of course not.
I heard that from a retired GS trader on an interview a couple weeks ago. Everyone is bumped up the risk curve since returns are so minimal. People are crowding into higher risk markets (like junk instead of investment, corporate credit instead of treasuries) and everyone is trying to have a foot out the door. Doesn't mean it'll collapse, just that everyone's more flighty and movements are more exaggerated because we're all doing the same thing
I hate google! Made 3x on puts yesterday and just gave it all back only keeping 100 bucks. Ugh
of course neither of my FD's print... got otm calls and puts... we flat as fuck rofl
Agree. It reinforces to me that you need to pick a direction in the market and have conviction.  You might make a bit of money here and there but it is very hard to keep up and make big returns.
Guys, long time bear here. I just capitulated and bought calls. I‚Äôm pretty sure this means the top is in. If not, can‚Äôt wait to enjoy bull tendies in the coming weeks together LFG!
Long term hold.  Im banking on it making me a millionaire by itself in 10 years.
The bull run has just started bro. Election will be officially called this weekend or tomorrow, (already has been on most betting sites), and we'll renew stimulus talks.
Is PLTR gonna pop again next week or what

It‚Äôs good to know we aren‚Äôt pumping today
And Rudy as well I think

He can average down
decriminalize is different from legalize. i think in the long term it will lead to less heroin users as they are sent to rehab instead of just throw in a jail cell which doesnt really solve anything
I hope you're right but I'm doubtful of politicians on either side learning their lesson. Primaries still need some improvements though, Pete and Amy dropping the way they did to hamstring Bernie definitely rubbed me the wrong way. Feels like the DNC is still playing games behind the scenes.
We got this brah
IV is so high on everything I don‚Äôt even know where to look at.
There‚Äôs always a way to sell them to the bots but you got to sell at the bid, not the ask and you typically get less than you would if it was more liquid.

Hey man if you‚Äôre willing to pay me, I‚Äôll take what I can get.
Lmao snowflake desperately holding onto hope. Sorry that your boy is such a sore loser
Lmao with zero dd you better believe I‚Äôm doing this just because you said so
Trumps militia wont be gone even if he loses the election. He basically has a private army.

Any other election I'd agree with you but I think given how hard the GOP is fighting the mail in ballot totals in several states i think at least a few of them will not be called until the last possible second.
If nothing else, this election season made it easy to block and mute a lot of fintwatters to twat about stupid shit unrelated to making money.

Yeah not happening. See reality for more info.
The train is still in the station, get yours while you can.
It was at 120 a couple years back. Assuming maybe a steady 40$ to next year maybe August.
Think AAL can ever hit 50 again in a year? It has the highest shares shorted in the S&P making it a good short squeeze candidate
Because once your an actual heroin addict, you don't want to be a heroin addict anymore.  But once you're far enough down that road there seems to be no other option but to continue.  Decriminalization and a focus on treatment removes some of the stigma and shame attached to addiction/addicts and offers them hope.  This a step forward in admitting that the war on drugs was a failure and that we need to try a humane approach towards dealing with addiction.

People don't want to be heroin addicts, trust me!

Max pain for SPY today is 343
I‚Äôm mostly out of my pre election strangles for some small winners. I know this melt up is for real, but it‚Äôs irritating to watch the manipulation.
I mean I would understand if it was a 50%-100% markup for novelty but 5x normal retail is pretty obnoxious and blatant.  And the price difference is noteworthy - most people won't know what that retails for.
Lol you fuckwit. Trumps stupidity has held the market back for at least two years now, and most of the gain in the first two was from the tax cuts. He has been about as unfriendly to business as it‚Äôs possible to be.
Bought NET puts yesterday and they aren't  showing a change in value.  Explain to a dummy why that is
Santorum was saying PA also recently got rid of it
We know the drill, spy is gonna kick 352‚Äôs teeth in EOD and completely shit the bed Monday

I was being a dumb ass making a stupid joke but wow that would be awesome. Please tell jpow and makes stonks go up more

They're gonna be over 590 almost for sure by earnings it could shoot up to $650 range if they beat by a lot

Do you even have any money?
Damn IPOB is mooning today.
Noob question:  Can you get to a point where you're so deep in the money that there's no interest in buying your call contracts when you sell them, and you're basically stuck with them even though they've made massive gains?

Or is there always a way to sell them?

Very telling when David Perdue receives more votes than Trump. It's not always down ballot folks.
All I ask is for a drill today, green dicks can continue on Monday
Yeah about to find it's support level
You also have a union, which is a lot easier for controlling and overseeing the facets of production.

Taxing to death corporations, lowering drug prices, invalidating years of education for menial pay (med school in US) etc etc, disincentives the work ethic. 

I believe in affordability; and no one should go bankrupt receiving healthcare, but there also has to be profit because there are many countless of hours and research DOING THE JOBS MOST PPL DONT WANT TO/ARENT SMART TO DO!
Do options‚Äô IV rise on competitors earnings? For example, would Apple calls IV rise when close to Microsoft earnings?
Snagged a couple 1/15/21 42c this morning. This stock is playing with my heart with all the volatility today.
ey bro this satire but thanks :) I actually love TD support they are always extremely helpful and don't make me feel like a dipshit when I call them. So glad I moved from retard RH
eh, maybe because the market went flying up the last two days and now that that euphoria is over reality sets in and oh yeah WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC THAT IS GETTING WORSE!  118,000 cases yesterday.  1200 deaths 2 days ago, 1100 deaths yesterday.

dis just foreplay, son. Trust me or ask any GME bear‚Äôs mom.

Also something important about GM is that they have the highest rated self-driving package in their supercruise feature present in caddys via consumer reports. They are one of the leading american companies in AV tech, and this will prove to be helpful long term.

Republicans would turn on him, they‚Äôre already getting their political alignments ready for a post-Trump world and they‚Äôre not going to support a coup to stay under his thumb. The Secret Service would have to remove him in service to the new president.

Trump can‚Äôt pull off a fraud-based election steal without the full political weight of the GOP. McConnell is a stone cold realist with no ultimate allegiance to Trump as soon as he‚Äôs out of power and is an old friend of Biden‚Äôs. He‚Äôs gonna dump Trump on his ass the minute sentiment turns.

They will enact the 25th amendment and pence will finish out the remaining 2 months.

Random thoughts for today- what Lee Cooperman said on CNBC this morning was 100% correct, and that is that Fed policy has forced everyone up the risk curve. To me that‚Äôs why the VIX continues to be elevated. Granted it‚Äôs down significantly this week with this insane rally but I think there‚Äôs more VIX upside at this point than downside. With such absurd valuations the market is going to continue to be prone to wild swings. You can‚Äôt have it both ways- huge market support and inflated valuations without market swings which is going to mean a higher VIX. IMO the days of a 15 VIX are history and 25-35 is going to be the new norm until we get a massive flush in the market.

118,000 covid cases yesterday.  so much winning.  1200 deaths followed by 1100 deaths.  were hitting some bigly numbers.  we're not going to let Europe show us up.
Well played
Sounds about right. McConnel could have easily help pass a nice stimulus that pushes the market up by another 10%, but no he wanted to wait. I think the saying this week is to put heads on stake so you might want to do that instead.
I fully expect Trump to give a gracious speech congratulating Biden on a well run campaign. A man as big as Trump will no doubt call upon his supporters to come together with Democrats for national unity. The challenges and opportunities ahead of the USA are bigger than republican or democrat agendas and must proceed. 

As it was his first day in office, the only thing important to trump is leaving America and the world on a path to be better than it was before he came along. /s
Jesus!
Feel like their guidance will be strong though
üìâ
fuck yeah!
Calls is if you think the stock will go up, puts is if you think it will go down. When you buy calls/puts and it hits itm, you make money(x100 shares per option). If it‚Äôs otm, they expire worthless. When buying them, you can only lose money you spent. Just don‚Äôt write them lol

Fucking idiots buying puts when its red. Buy them when its green!
Same hear I trade with like 50k when a wealth management company manage the rest of my money. They do know how to pick them and they also know exactly how to unwind the position before it drops somehow. Wall Street really know how to make money if you give them your money. The machine is really in their favor in every possible way üòÇ
I mean the 10k flat forgiveness, then 10k a year forgiveness for each year as a governemnt or non-profit employee. I think theres a decent chance that those measures get bipartisan support, since the right needs to start pandering to students with debt if they want to win 2024. 

Either way, I secured a sweet government spot, so at minimum public service loan forgiveness plus EDRP (I think that's the acronym?) for me
Why not? Could have bought when it was under $83

I've actually never sold calls before. I started with 400 calls and sold 200 this morning for a net gain of $105,000. With the 200 calls that I have now, I have around $100k gains and am planning to hold those. My target price is $20.
Yessssssiiiiir
20k for me,mainly because im only in shares and covered calls now. if i had calls id be up about a million

It might be because so many of them are heavily religious. Belief guides them before anything else. I tend to question everything I believe. But I dont think the average Trumper can't even fathom that level of self-scrutiny.

And they dont want to. It requires mental work and an openness to the possibility that you are wrong, which could rock a person's self-image.
