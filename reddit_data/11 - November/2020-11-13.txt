Leaps are going to be worth so much it's actually crazy. Unless TSLA somehow undercuts NIO to the point they are delisted I can't imagine it doesn't at least double in price in a year from now. 

NIO has all the tech and backing they need for a huge market share. They just need to execute now and actually meet the demand and sell more.
Hey man pussy's hold up over time.

Good thing I‚Äôm holding spy calls
he's about to get banned, my meme about nio was just removed because it mentioned nio in a positive light.
Good game friend
That's actually pretty grand to see. Someone on this sub ACTUALLY understands the game. 

Not a bad move at all, though. I just couldn't imagine the boredom in waiting for those positions to do something üòÇ
If I weren't a broke unemployed idgit I wouldn't be buying 0dte options, I would be buying more dated positions keeping view of the market.
all the time but my trading account is about 250k so that's not necessarily a huge amount to put into one stock I believe in
You know there‚Äôs a thing called puts right. Sounds like you caught the gay bear bug. Try out being a gay bear, until you lose all your money, then convert back to a stronger than ever bull. See you soon
sry bud were opening at 362 on monday, better roll that to wednesday

Fuck calls, weeklies, fds...  baba has been dead in the water for a week. Leaps and shares are ez money. Yes we all want a 10 bagger, but that is simply gambling.
LOL ... price floor is 40...
Dis nibba seriously bought $400 calls two months out? lmao
Can someone tell me what üçëis lol
Look at big balls out here smoking oil.. ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh fancyyyyyyy
Thank you
I agree, but I think there will be people that pull money out and sit when it pops. I think it will take longer than it should have more initial market resistance than the last drop. The money people made from the last comeback after the drop could give us a false bottom where we think it‚Äôs done and coming back and then it falls ever lower. Or stimi just gonna help it coast without major drop because fuck me.
Can I take your spot in the shareholders meeting?
Wow ok. Need security card details? Is this SaFe?

Of course not. I'm balls deep in 11/20 48p right now bro I'm not going to sell these Monday just to lotto all my hard-earned winnings away.
However, I did work with salespeople that dumb. off rip asking ‚Äúif you test drive this car and you like it and we can agree to numbers will you buy it today?‚Äù

Hope you all bought üçë today. Moon mission 2.0 this week
That's true, there is real value there and it took years for it to show for TSLA. NIO hasn't proven it's salt yet, especially with the competition they will be facing from TSLA trying to not lose a huge market.
I‚Äôll say it again. Percs. Alcohol is def not the move.
One of us
Sounds like something only a republifuck believes
As soon as NIO mentions that they have an EV Smart Car (but safer) in the works and plan on selling it for cheap, that'll do it. To infinity, and beyond!
Now we have 3 days for this to go worldwide and bring mass trendies to NIO er ü§ë
I think people were more worried about the pump to drop difference. People who bought 1 dte calls lost 100% of their investment while people who bought puts made x30. I saw someone play the perfect wedge on here for +250k. I was impressed with the 0dte wedge play.

NIO back to ATH Monday
Did Tesla start with everything we see today? No

Nio is new. Give it time to prove itself
Their Q3 vehicle sales went up 154% YOY in the middle of a pandemic. They literally can‚Äôt make more cars than the demand that they have at the moment. 

Legacy car companies make electric vehicles but that‚Äôs literally just putting a battery in the car. They don‚Äôt have the OS and level 3 autonomous driving tech of NIO or Tesla, which is where the real value is.
That‚Äôll really make him go flaccid
Tesla and Wal-Mart have market caps of about $400B. 

This make sense because Wal-Mart‚Äôs $200B of real estate is 2X the largest REIT and Tesla has a tent factory.
Can anyone tell me what this means
That really doesn't matter. When they could be an entire week off.
Haha but forreal. A test drive is a huge waste of a salesman‚Äôs time. Esp when they‚Äôre 100% commission and you just wanna test drive a 100 cars for 6 months before you finally decide to buy one.
Well I have some FU money. What‚Äôs the most I could lose? Plus anything I learn would be 10 more valuable. I‚Äôm a conservative trader otherwise.
Bro it's like midnight on a Friday
It must‚Äôve been scary af investing back in the day. Any tard could‚Äôve just made up some news on this new and upcoming company and you couldn‚Äôt check on the internet or anything. Your only hole would be the newspaper and they‚Äôd be getting paid off anyways.
NIO and RKT would drop for sure
guys what happens when an etf buys a etf
Reasonable

But nio is a premium brand, so it‚Äôs not targeting everyone
Don‚Äôt jack it 4x a day is a good place to start. After that alcohol.

Invite them into your life. They‚Äôre probably lonely
We're hurtling toward a brave new world of negative interest rates, unrestrained QE, yield curve control, and UBI. The V-shaped recovery is part of a constructed narrative that is an economic  policy tool in and of itself because The Fed and the economic powers that be are terrified that they will run out of ammo. The demographics are fucked. Right now we are almost imperceptibly turning Japanese. But by the time the next wave of economic pain hits, we will be 100% pure Japanese. Your dryer lint will be on The Fed's balance sheet.

US debt that is owned by other countries is in us currency. The United States of America owns their own money presses and can print money in their own currency. This is why they can have unlimited debt forever. This is the way.

This is the vibe I'm getting as well. Wish I could jump 60 hours in the future.
9 figures is more than enough
I mean I think it continues, Moderna should release results Wednesday or earlier and Pfizer said they‚Äôd have safety results to apply for emergency use by the third week of November which is next week too. I think something similar to last Monday happens this week at least once

This rotation also feels permanent, previous ones lasted a day or two at most

PSX for instance couldn‚Äôt even break the 10 day average for 3 straight months but sliced all the way through the 100 day like cheese this week. It fell like 7% yesterday trying to break and then jumped up straight through it today on another huge up day. All of it‚Äôs on heavy volume too. Very excited for next week

Future priced EV during a global pandemic? I'll believe something is future priced when the market is less volatile. 

NIO is going up eventually there's no doubt about it to me but the time is not now. Sure, it has backing from important sectors and awesome technology but it is selling very few cars still. You're saying that the market cap of legacy companies deserves to be less than NIO? Not right now.

Happy cake day!

I'm gonna look for a new entry. Trailing stop didn't go in my favor this time. Call it an insurance fee. Yes enjoy the gains. Don't get emotional. Look for another opportunity nio or not. I just bought LI at 31 today when a limit order from earlier in the day fulfilled shortly after my trailing loss triggered. Lots of action on Friday the 13th, lol
Market is about to pop to the next level, IWM already broke through. It might drag ass, but it‚Äôs *way* too risky to stay cash gang in my humble opinion.
NIO has value in its automated driving tech, NIO GAC, tech backing, its brand is excellent, govt backing + all the green EV laws in China. It‚Äôs basically going to succeed and reach that level. But until like 10 days ago, it wasn‚Äôt convincing. Now it is and it‚Äôs a future priced in scenario. May be overvalued at current output but that‚Äôs not what the stock price really means
I‚Äôm on dec14 puts man my buddy went to the gym feeling sick and tested positive the next day after I told him stay home people don‚Äôt care how can this keep going

This is market manipulation. These companies should not be allowed to affect prices by speculating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Then it'll moon back up on earnings next week. The question is to hold forever for when it becomes chinese tsla or sell then buy it back if it crashes back down.

Why are you bums buying NIO when you can buy doggy coin. Much win much gains very wow

Odd how we are hopeful for reopening literally as states are closing and covid is skyrocketing.

Good luck.  I bought some shares yesterday and today.  Not sure when this downward trend reverses.  Hopefully starting next week.

Nio calls had me rolling at the end
found the guy who consistently buys FDs from theta thugs and gets burned bigly
I guess stock like this is why everyone keeps saying buy options, because if I'd done that I would have only risked the same or less than I lost on my stop loss, and I'd  still be holding the options..
While the tech is showing signs of being over valued. like the dot com bubble. I don‚Äôt think it will bust. It will trade sideways till the rest of the market catches up. But what do I know I‚Äôm retarded.
Oh, forgot we aren't out of vaccine pumps today. Thought the 20% rise on Monday covered vaccine hopes.

Not wrong. Shares also volatile so that also match autistic level of this thread

The real question is, how eager do you think people are to create another stock with a P/E of >1000?

If it wasn't a Chinese stock, I'd argue that people might be more willing to inflate these valuations. But the reality is that the Chinese government, as we just saw this week with stocks like BABA, can quickly tighten the vice grip and wipe billions off a valuation.

Chinese stocks are also riskier in general, and Chinese IPOs, with few exceptions, have been poor performers.

If anything, the recent surge in EVs should solidify this sub's love for Tesla, which has a brilliant team (albeit a "colorful" leader) behind it.

Obviously we are seeing an EV arms race, but that means there will be many losers. GM and Ford entering the arena should be concerning.

I think people aren't going to give up on these stocks, as we have seen countless times that the MMs, algorithms, and meme lovers latch on to something and ride it until their asses are chafed, but the reality is that the EV market is just the flavor of the month right now because of an incoming Biden presidency.

Will it last? For companies like Tesla, yes. For other speculative companies? Who knows.

For the most part, I try to avoid Chinese stocks at all costs.

Obviously there are a ton of people in China, but for the EV market to take advantage of that population, the target prices need to drop significantly, and that won't happen any time soon.
bought more at like 44 yesterday and bought more on the dip today. Nio is making more cars than TSLA did at this stage, their stonk is super-undervalued and will never die- the company is backed by the Chinese government. Sit back and hold on for the ride, babe
Never mind I read SPX for some reason lmao

You are supposed to be patient when trading. Always wait for dips to buy.
This is what happens when wealthy people don't educate property their children.

The first thing that they need to teach the kids is to value their time and money, learn the value of things, not just the price tag. Then make them work hard, and I mean really hard to get what they want.

When they understand that things come with hard work and not just because they are entitled to them then they get wealthy on knowledge, and that is worth more than money.
Yeah I bought shares

Seriously though look at the yearly and 5 year chart. Even at ATH in Feb SPXS was near 13 dollars, at a similar price point now it is only 4.50. Might load myself to the tits in 2021 puts and hope for a reverse split?

Can somebody explain to me why long dated puts on SPXS isn‚Äôt free money?
Sure, but you can schedule your car for on-site swap or to be taken to a nearby swap station if there is one. They'll come out and do it for you and put your car back where you left it. Labor costs in China are a pittance, this service likely costs very little.
So? We have yet to actually evaluate their potential with actually cars and see how they compete. The legacy car brands were bailed out on tax dollars because they couldn't survive.  Any electric car can easily go 0 - 60 in 3 seconds with enough motors and power. How efficiently it generates that power is another story. I bet the Americans are going with the brute force method like they do with their ICE cars.

Rivian has better potential than Ford/GM with their truck. GM with Cruise Automative, does have a lead on Ford. GM significantly downside cruise this year.
Remember, its only a loss if you sell.

In a couple years the Chinese EVs will have copied every ip and tech that tesla has and then the Chinese gov will kick tesla out on some flimsy excuse.

The big carrot in front of Musk is hiding china's hand on the trap door lever from view.

Just look at what happened with Huawei and the like, undercutting and copying Samsung and apple to grab 3rd biggest market share or so. If usa didn't block them they would soon screw the USA market (regardless how you feel about it, they'd just take over the lead).

Explain to me how banks lose in a scenario where they have already sold off the federally guaranteed student loans to other buyers at high prices? Savings rates, new investors, and new loans could skyrocket. Suddenly a lot more people could be cash rich from the "wage increase" of student debt forgiveness. In the short and long-term banks stand to gain a lot. Also don't forget the way they will pay for this is supposedly increased taxes, which are already on the table along with a repeal of Trump's TCJA in 2017. What truly will happen though is impossible to predict, because sometimes economists work in their bubble and theorize far too much away from reality.

Hmm I'm not sure then after the last earnings it gapped up and had probably the best two weeks it's had so far. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if it goes down it seems the market isn't particularly surprised by earnings beat from e-commerce stocks with the exception of PDD which went up like 28% in the past two days. Just here hoping that since BABA took a huge beating and JD is taking customers from BABA that some of that will go to JD to break ATH after earnings.

Planning to do that as well. I had some calls but shares is just safer. Who knows how long this could drag on for.
There is always risk for more downside with BABA, but I feel like it finally started to show some signs of fighting back after the initial selloff this morning. I am confident in next week, and also have positions.

BABA is oversold, just put up great numbers for their singles day, and JD, which also was faced with regulatory issues, has hardly had the reactionary selloff that BABA had (obviously the ANT IPO played a part in this).

BABA is still a great stock and without question a buy at this level. As COVID cases rise and more states enter lockdown, expect people to put money back into e-commerce and lockdown stocks--which got rocked after an announcement of a vaccine that can't even be transported happened.

I was also trying to do some street level research on this outfit, living in Portland when I heard the word they were opening a location in the PNW I was all ears. Called IR, found out the where and when and was disappointed to discover that instead of the urban center of PDX, they chose the Washington Square Mall. Now, that‚Äôs not all bad because that‚Äôs in Washington County the more affluent end of PDX but it‚Äôs suburban for sure, so I called the mall to get some details on the type of space they leased. Now for the finale: they literally just leased a Kiosk spot just outside the Nordstrom. This is where you would hear the sad trombone music. Cheap and unprofessional... felt weak as fuck. Just my two cents, sold my position for a small gain at the time.

Probably not. There wasn't much reactionary movement to the current COVID situation, and it might become even more clear over the weekend. It wouldn't surprise me if SPY tested levels \~352 early in the session. I don't expect SPY to have some huge downward movement over the week, especially as people turn more away from cyclicals and back into Tech COVID stocks, but hey.

Also everything I just wrote will probably be wrong because SPY doesn't give a fuck.

Chess is apparently the way.
I am pretty new as well so I wouldn't really take advice from me. And it really depends on what your goal is. My goal is to hold a stock for a few years and hopefully see it dominate in an industry -- i.e. become a leader like Amazon in retail/cloud. 

If you're willing to wait 1-5 years, I think this stock has potential to go $60-100 by end of next year, and after that sky might be the limit. China is dead serious about green energy. If you go on youtube and search for terms like "china desertification" you'll see why. 

Global warming is destroying China. They see it as an existential crisis for them. It's not like America where if the next president is Republican he might cancel green energy rebates. They are all in.

I believe in NIO because I doubt China is willing to hand over entire segments of their EV industry to Tesla. I'm not saying China is going to dick over Tesla or anything, but I definitely think China will give a helping hand to their EV players when necessary.

Now this doesn't mean NIO isn't a risk. But I feel is a risk worth taking given that all new car sales in 2035 has to be new energy vehicles.

* [Sand storms in Chinese cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMnE_IwE61E&)

It's hard for me to watch those videos and not believe China would be extremely dedicated to EVs.

Sorry, do you ever watch how bonds effect the stock market? It might be interesting to look into how different bonds effect different industries. Pump to $14 was an election boos, but the Monday 6.50-8.50 pump was a cyclical pump from the bonds, and the tail end makes me think they were consolidating for another major pump.

Yeah, that's the vibe I got too. Weird DD: I've got a very-liberal friend in India who hates Trump but would see him re-elected because he's worried about China's soft-power expansion. So I figure if soft-power expansion is so important to them, they won't do anything to truly kneecap one of their tech powerhouses. In fact, what they want to do is inspire investor confidence- after the Luckin fiasco they want to tighten up regs. Probably to avoid financial catastrophe, exactly as you describe. 

The way they did it was pretty dramatic and had the opposite effect on short-term foreign confidence, it has people saying "oh the CCP is just gonna CCP" but I think you're right that it's just a long-term move that will actually protect consumers and investors.

Lithium demand will increase in the future, but shortages that'll impact lithium stocks might not be felt for a while (2025 and beyond). Now is the time to position yourself though for the coming EV wave in the later part of the decade. 8-10 years will go by in no time.  I'll probably stop after 1000-1500 shares.

in a recent chinese population survey, NIO received 34% of votes in a survey about which EV they prefer. This was the most votes of any company, including TSLA, BMW, XPEV
Stockholm is pretty cool.
Nio stock price too high imo
Its not proper to say on here but huge fan of ETFs.  Not an individual stonk kind of guy.
Just do spreads, safer. They can't go up that far that fast.
Please judge/opine on my positions for Monday: 

NIO debit spread 11/20 47C/55C. Bought dip‚Äî2 dollar net debit. 7k exposure. Down like 15%. Will cut on Monday if I get to ~30% in losses otherwise, I plan to hold and exit if it tests 47-48 before ER. 

AAL 11/20 12.5C picked up EOD

IWM long strangle 11/20 173/172 

QQQ 11/20 290P

ABUS 11/20  5C 

Wynn 11/20 93C

SE debit spread 11/20 195C/205C. Been playing all week and rolling up vertically 

SPY 11/20 359C
I agree with this period so many of them have already earned so much more money just off of the ridiculous interest charged on student loans, the loss wouldn't be as great as it would initially seem
100% printing

Why do people think Sweden is such a good country? I bet they don‚Äôt even have Chick-fil-A. Losers.

Give them some grieving time bro. Citron did a number on them.
Yeah I love how people make claims with such conviction, like we aren't all just making educated guesses at best
Production problem? They're an expanding company growing in size to accomodate their increasing sales. I wouldn't say that's a production problem. I would say that's future growth incoming.
Aren‚Äôt kids expensive? I only have cats and tons of free time.
Damn lol
What shit
The shitposts are also good for this sub. Many of the memes end up getting to the front page, which brings in new users, and therefore more people to buy my shit.
Is this in Greenwich? Lol
Theoretically though, you could have an optimal move for any situation. Interesting to think about....at the very top level of chess, I imagine the players essentially max out their mental RAM with as many of the optimal moves as they can remember and then it just defaults back to ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù chess thinking deeply through every move.
Dad is that you?
Yeah I love it. And really? That surprises me with how bad Dallas‚Äôs Covid numbers were. I also have seen some reports of schools closing there but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just speculation or not

I‚Äôm not sure any sectors in particular would be crushed. Since there‚Äôs a ton of money in private loans, we wouldn‚Äôt see those impacted - only the federally held loans would be impacted. My guess is we may see the 10 year treasury go up, because long term spending would increase by the consumers who are bogged down by the debts. Maybe those private financial companies who financed student loans would get a boost because they are the only game in town on that paper?

I wouldn't worry too much about it. Personally I'm not. There's good reason behind the whole Ant Group, Alibaba and Chinese government drama if you care to dig into it. The Chinese government is putting a cap on micro lending on asset backed securities. So now fintech companies need to fund a minimim 30% of all loans (previously, it was 0). I'm assuming it's because they don't want some financial catastrophe as a result of encouraging irresponsible risk taking like the mortgaged back security housing crisis of 08 - 09. Long story short, they didn't want every mom and pop to borrow a ton of money to gamble it on FDs, multiple houses and other assets like Masayoshi Son.

Just my 2cents on the whole alibaba drama. But I would encourage to do your own digging. I most likely missed out some detail.
Just narrow in on weekly spy calls/options

China government directly buys chinese companies, that's what he's saying. It's well known that they manipulate the hell out of their market and anything they think will bring honor and prestige to the country.

It will be interesting to see what they do with nio because it's so incredibly overvalued, but having a 'chinese tesla' is good PR for them too.  I don't know what their budget is for bagholding though.
this is the way

The huge amount of new spending power freed up would be great for basically every industry.   And the banks would be the only ones who would loose out.   But in lon run they may do better with people having money free to put down deposits on cars and houses again giving them a new income

If you look at the past two weekly candles of the NASDAQ you'd see that this week's candle made a lower wick into the prior weeks massive 9% candle (that's called a retrace > up, down, consolidate, next move up = healthy/steady/less volatile price action) - if you look at the DOW, this week's candle big gap up over prior weeks without a similar retrace / spx this week's candle not entering prior weeks massive 7% would make me nervous and very cautious right now on the bullish side as it'll likely selloff more/harder as it creates more space away from it

I was talking about nios exponential growth.  FAANGs exponential growth will not continue because much of its potential value is realized. NIO has barely grazed the surface, if at all. Additionally you are forgetting about QE which is inevitable in this era.
He didn't hear it though
Honestly anything can happen. Best of luck.

u/r2002 yo, i'm a new investor, i really just started full swing (not a swing trader haha) in august and Citron Research is making me feel conflicted about NIO, do you not think it would be wise to sell for NIO to make profit before they dip and then buy more shares when it lowers?

This is the move. Sell a chunk to cover your initial cost and ride the rest through. Or even buy more during a dip like this. The only hard part about investing is being patient and not losing your shit like everyone else does every time it dips for a blink in time over the next 10 years.

I covered a lot of my positions at the end of Monday and actually played some puts on the stocks I really like long term for recovery. That pfizer news caught me off guard in a good way. I assumed I'd be able to get back into most of my oil/air/hospitality/banks (I like regional banks) with covid kicking our butt and now am a bit worried to get all the opportunities to do so. Starting to feel like a stream of vaccine news may offset all this covid impact then stimulus talks to follow. Oil looked decent yesterday for re-entry then took off again today.

Besides assignment risk there is one another thing. You tie your shares to the sold contracts, so you can‚Äôt sell them until the contracts expire. Or until you repurchase them. It basically makes your portfolio a little less liquid.

Also, really far otm options are too cheap.
Easy. Tap on the space where the flair is and the whole comment and replies collapse.

There‚Äôs no telling when the delusion ends, and those fuckers shouldn‚Äôt have the strings that control the susceptible idiots. Yes, the stock is overvalued. So is any stock that has decent volume. This is purely more manipulation that these fucks can profit off of. 

If only the retailers understood that with each day, we become a larger portion of the market. These companies only have this power when give it to them.

I sold a covered call this week, so that worked out for me, but seeing this movement today was sad.
friends?
Don‚Äôt open your investment app for 30 days. Look back at it again a month from now and reply to this post telling us how you feel now that your money has doubled.

It'll be time to buy GME calls again once all these asshats dump theirs and send the stock down.
When you finally have a couple of million and start hanging out with millionaires who have more, all the sudden your couple of million doesn't feel like much so you work harder to get more but it's just never enough.

The lesson is, once you're a millionaire, stick with your broke friends, you'll feel content. Just don't tell them you're rich and act as if you're broker than they are. 

Note: Not my personal experience. I'm broke AF.
You can always get back into engineering once you make enough from trucking and your Tesla calls. Dreams live forever

Broke even on XPEL 11/20 30c last week that would have probably been up 300% min at close today. So much money I‚Äôve paperhanded. Meanwhile I‚Äôm gonna diamond hands these 2k calls for 100% loss.

Mastery is more about talent than practice (though both are required) regardless of whatever propaganda you've imbibed to the contrary. If you aren't getting recognition for being stellar already (after like, a year or two of learning something) probably just chill out and put no more than 30 hours a week into what you're trying to do  because you are unlikely to ever match the abilities of your genetic superiors no matter how much you grind,  and you will enjoy your life more if it's more balanced and grind free.

>Limiting your loss to -15% -20% you can do this daily and in a year or two get HUGE

Cutting losses is huge to gaining wealth unironically. An investment strategy I would recommend to people is to just make small daily plays. Incorporate playing earnings, weeklys, and lottos: Never putting down more in any combination of these than what you can confidently make back in whatever timeframe you consider to be reasonable (example: 1 week).

Its set up for a run into earnings.  It bounced off the 50 day EMA today, the Stoch RSI on the daily is crossing bullish, and the MACD is crossing bullish on the hourly.  They are expected to show a 46% growth in revenue year over year, and 44% increase in EPS.  There have been 35 upward estimate revisions leading to this earnings, and no downward.  Expectations are crazy high, and the stock is coming off a 14% sell off.  If the market is stagnant or green over the next week, I think we see NVDA run up to 590-600 again, then tank on earnings.  I think they beat, but not enough to justify a share price of $600.

Position:  11/4 545 call.  IV is only 53%.  Gonna hopefully ride the wave up then sell before earnings.
Can you give any kind of reasonable backing to that claim because right now you sound like a troll and a shitty troll at that.

Whichever of you made a comment about buying PLTR last night thank you. I got in at open this morning. Easy cash!
Is this the Citron fella?
He‚Äôs saying that you lock in gains with a debit spread and to also simultaneously create a credit spread. Why? Well if you‚Äôre super otm, it‚Äôs likely the underlying won‚Äôt reach the strike.

So instead of having a ghetto debit spread that could possibly hit and make max profit, you set your max profit scenario to be if the stock never reaches your strike. This really only works if the contracts remain otm. Otherwise creating a ghetto debit spread is superior.

Because if your credit spread does get busted, you‚Äôll be covered with your debit spread.

Also this guy is talking just about locking in gains. You could be greedy as hell and make an even fatter debit / credit spread. As long as the underlying moves in your direction gains can be made/capitalized upon with your naked contracts

What time is ER call tho? Here‚Äôs my theory: Americans sell the news. Chinese buy the news. If ER is early morning US time, stock price will go up and we will continue mooning here.

Yup that‚Äôs me everyday. There‚Äôs some days I lose so much money I get physically ill. There‚Äôs other days I win huge and feel like the top of the world. It‚Äôs a sickness, and the market makes money off those flaws. Hell I lost 8k on BA puts today because it just wouldn‚Äôt stop running. I thought to myself this doesn‚Äôt make sense everything is priced in blah blah no one flying blah blah market doesn‚Äôt care. It wanted to gobble my premiums and it did.

I think you're correct on the situation, but you're misreading the room.

Biden doesn't take office until January, and we are going to see some states lock down, while the others have hospitals announce "no one without severe conditions or over 65 admitted." 

I have concerns about trump's lame duck months. The quote, "have you even broken up with a narcissist?" weighs heavy in my mind, having broken up with narcissists.

I dig it. Thanks for the advice!
Lmao it doesn‚Äôt just happen randomly so this would be pretty stupid
Did you hold or sell?  Mine expire Friday.  Just curious...
Im okay if i break even. When i bought it i knew something was gonna happen. Mainstream stocks always crash after some analysts or stock watchers write a disparaging article. I was gonna ride the wave for a few days like i do with every stock. I always hold stocks for 3 to 5 days or when it hits a good point i sell. I never hold more than 5 days tops 10 days if its a stock like apple
Seems like we‚Äôre on the same page. I‚Äôm thinking a recession is not just going to go away. So deflation will occur, to what end is unknown currently. Will take a lot of spending and export positive economy to get us into an inflationary environment.
Fuck, at least you can afford a ladder.
Someone watched the big short
Lol
Weird because I had 50 calls and made 10x my money.  Just saying they dumped after earnings and my calls dropped 60% at open with loss of volitility and a $5 stock price drop, and yes it went back up.
Elon‚Äôs such a fuk for going into the China market and allowing the vultures to pick apart his work. He truly belongs here
Thats good, sell 20x calls around .20 deltas should net you about 400-500/week.

Thats literally every single shitter on this sub who is whining about NIO rn. They're just mad as shit they didn't get in early
Most sold too early. Even RenTech sold too early. They had a very good buy in.
Yes, I lost over 50k in the first week of September and quit until this last week.

It sucks bro...I got to have a little something at stake just for my own sanity. Only holding a few k in spy calls rn but it at least gets the blood going
I'm confused about the whole numbers on this thing can you clarify.

that's why i have long dated calls

NOICE!
Nuff said.
I‚Äôll trade options with like 5-10% of my portfolio at most. It‚Äôs a lot easier to make money using shares, and if you wanna get ballsy you can just use margin for leverage. Making 20% 5 times with your entire portfolio is mentally easier than making 150% on an option trade
You fucktards are all wrong. Spy 380 eoy

Totally agree. Even people that have been highly critical of others that don‚Äôt wear masks or distance are now hopping on planes to enjoy thanksgiving with family. Fauci and Jerome were always right. But markets aren‚Äôt going down regardless. 

SPY 400c 3/19
This strat still has risks but if you‚Äôre super OTM I can definitely see how this locks in more gains. Good idea.

Risk being that you get on the hook for your credit spread and lose some of your ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù gains. I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôre selling contracts for more than we paid + the difference in strike ofc

You‚Äôre just saying ‚Äúhey I don‚Äôt want a ghetto debit or credit spread solely, I want both‚Äù

Just curious

FAA been dicking around with BA for so damn long, they'll pass anything with wings that doesn't have a history of killing people.
What a crazy day today!! It was nice to see it up at $54 for a bit. I‚Äôm bullish, and will be holding this for a long time!  I think we all think about what if. I do know though that if there‚Äôs any next best things that I‚Äôll buy a few thousand and hold instead of wait for it to pop and then only buy a few hundred. You might be able to pay off a mortgage in a year or two with this one!
He jelq'd to the gains
I've been chuckling at this for a good 5 mins

You can easily make north of 300k with stock in SF. I know a number of people who came out of some IPOs 2+million richer for 4 years at a company.

Also sitting on CBAK shares. Suck my stinky pinky for moonday.
Merger getting announced soon that's why it's been building, most ppl think 12/17 is the date they will do that so probably see a runup before then idk why but I think next week.

Jack Ma, one of the founders, explained:

One day I was in San Francisco in a coffee shop, and I was thinking Alibaba is a good name. And then a waitress came, and I said, "Do you know about Alibaba?" And she said yes. I said, "What do you know about him?", and she said, "Open Sesame". And I said, "Yes, this is the name!"
yes. find a stock thats going up and day trade it through the dips and rises. not that tough if you have a good amount to throw in, thats the biggest barrier to entry and gains with shares. make 3-5% and go home for the day.
Sales multiples they are about a quarter of baba ATM. But I really don't know where 800 comes from

Look for the ones that revolve around communications and work from home. Same reason why zoom made ppl millionaires. Although keep in mind that the lockdown will only be temporary and only play the rally. Not long term.
my assertion is that using an opposite monetary policy as the prior instance will cause a different (albeit still bad. just not as bad.) outcome.

Stimulus isn't coming until Feb. 

Senate is in recess right now. Repubs are on their way out the door. You think Moscow Mitch will want the costs of a second stimulus on Trump's tab? No way. 

He's going to make the Dems pay for it, so he can pretend to be "fiscally concerned" again. 

By the time checks are out, it will be mid Feb at the earliest.

48 DTE out an ATM put last sold for $10.25 so when the option expires worthless you're making $1025 on a $7156 investment, which is a 14% return in less than 50 days (minus whatever the margin rate is)

To put in perspective. It costs like 2-3k to get it installed on a car. Even people who buy luxury cars don‚Äôt consider it. It‚Äôs more so people with really high end cars like 200k+ that buy it.

Although the money supply surged, the monetary base rose to keep up with it. The money multiplier signals a rise in inflation or not. Currently it‚Äôs rolling over, indicating deflationary pressure.

Price inflation is different. Is this what you mean?

I mean inflation in terms of the expansion of money in the system.

Lol nio back to 25s would save me. I don't think selling is over. Looking at JKS, nio should prob keep dumping hopefully
Ha ha ha. After more NIO dumps we might have to bunk up in my parent's basement. Hope you like being a bottom.
Depends on what you mean free money? If it's a low vol stock like JNJ you make very little since the IV is low but there's also a super low chance it blows past the strike. It's probably on average a little bit profitable but it's not that much.
I think the main problem is low expectations for next year. People don't care about their 2020 numbers. Obviously those will be great because of the massive drop in interest rates following covid. Big investors aren't sure they can keep it up. Though I have no idea why the stock went up to $34 if that were the case so I could be wrong. They keep saying they're a fintech, but haven't done much to convince the market of that. They need to do more outside of housing. The share buyback is odd. I'd rather they acquire more businesses or branch out.

With Oregon and New Mexico entering "partial" lockdown, and with California and New York clearly being in exponential growth of COVID cases, we're going to see several states enter lockdown over the next few weeks.

If these trends continue, one of Biden's first moves may be to impose a general lockdown. With Thanksgiving and Christmas both coming, and there being basically no measures in place to slow spread right now, this is going to continue to get out of control.

Anti-Maskers can say what they want, but when governors see their hospitals at 120% capacity across the state, they're going to have to shut down, regardless of their political leanings.

Positions: 3/19 IWM $150p.
Ok drunk talk, but real talk. Covid numbers go up, stocks hit all time highs. Vaccine news comes out, stock hit all time highs. Stocks start to dip? Throw in some stimulus tease headlines, problem solved!   This whole market doesn't make sense but you can't deny that shits going up
It's not that simple ARM processors are not just simple switch for any AAA game, of which most build their own engine like frostbite or crye Hine. Moving to an ARM processor from x64 processor is like going from working in a full Nascar garage to your dad's shed. Yes, you can do all the same stuff but it's a lot easier having all the tools available. The whole reason Apple is moving to ARM is because their sick of building 2 of everything, do you think game devs are going to want to start building a game for another platform?

It depends on which market you‚Äôve been looking at. As bond yields go up cyclicals will go up with it. As bond yields go down, tech companies will go inverse the bonds. What you saw was a .1bp move in 2/5year bond yields. That forced every cyclical to go up. Look at bonds and what bond traders are doing because that is what has been driving the market as of late. Bond yields a la cyclicals have to go up in order for there to be another crash or else everything already crashed and tech is the only thing that needs to be flushed.
I bet. I got in this AM when it was at about $172.50. 

Picked up 92 contracts of 3/19 IWM $150p.

literally EXACTLY this. sold nio for big profit at open, should have ended the day and walked away, but i threw it all back into li right at the top. stock plummeted and i finally pulled the plug around 35. Loss was so big it erased everything i gained from the week and a bit more. time to get back to work next week and get back to growing the portfolio again. learned a lesson or two from this and thats the most important thing.

Ya you really want options with high liquidity and decent volatility.
other way around for most people
Pretty sure anyone even remotely responsible here is only betting a small portion of their portfolio on options. Vast majority should be in something much safer and future thinking.
Fucking exactly, no stressing starring at futures like a degenerate every night. No stressing, just small scalps quick in and out 15 mins -30 mins. Extra 60k for doing nothing. Hell you can work minimum wage and make over 100k a year doing this strategy. Now assume you‚Äôve built up a decent account where you wouldn‚Äôt even feed bad burning 2k, you easily start adding 5k a week to yourself. Just in and out quick, not holding overnight not caring about earnings or current events. The only thing that can kill you is a stock being flat all day, which rarely happens. It will go up then go down even if it stays flat for the day. Limiting your loss to -15% -20% you can do this daily and in a year or two get HUGE

Slow as fuck but way to get 10% CAGR with virtually no draw downs is standard 60% SPY, 40% TLT re balance quarterly.

I have 10 calls for 11/20 there was about 250m worth of shares bought up today buy Baupost.

Seth Klarman's Baupost fund takes new positions in Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine (NYSE:PSTH) with 17.5M shares and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) with 5.22M shares, according to its latest 13F filing.
I am not waiting around to find out haha. i will exit my positions a couple days before the event, but based on my dd, they'll have a successful flight, they have been working on this for years and have already tested similar flights. the last time a big crash happened with sth like this was like 10 years ago. i think its pretty unlikely to happen now.
Part of the reason why TSLA has stalled since September is that its constant price reduction has not been received well in China, alongside other "squishy" selling practices. At the same time, local players have seen sales gathering more momentum.

I don't doubt Elon will continue to find big success in the China market over the long run, but to portray this as a zero-sum game as Citron did there is retarded.

Case in point, why didn't Tesla rally after the report came out? Go a step further, Model Y made in Shanghai is old news, the price nonetheless, didn't seem to care at all
Yep watching my numbers go way down and the finger‚Äôs still sitting on the buy button to see how great this discount gets.

OK, the full disclosure is that I only play desktop games (League of Legends, Overwatch, etc). I never play games on my phone so that might be why I might be psychologically against it.

Although I have met one investment banker who used to work at Zynga and he said as an intern he spent like 2 weeks trying to figure out which color chickens should be in some game. He was using his Stanford degree in data analytics to find what's most addicting. So I guess there's that.

You'll be fine. Look at all the stock price upgrades lately. JP morgan analysts both with 40+ and citi as well. The statement by Andrew Left today came at quite the time didn't it? Why didn't he just wait until after earnings? NIO reported year over year earnings in Q3, and their has been countless catalysts to prove NIOs worth including the recent contract with Bejing. Read between the lines. That manipulative cock sucker wanted his peice of the pie. Oh and don't forget to look at how many shares institutions have been loading up on recently.


Long story short....YOU'RE RICH!

It's coming. Doesn't matter what the Fed does. All they can do is buy time. Capital is a special kind of fluid. It decays immediately. Wherever there is a choke- point in the flow of capital there is crises. This is the largest disruption of the flow of capital I've ever witnessed and probably the worst in American history. To think it's just gonna keep humming along is retarded. But who can say when the music will stop? Nobody knows

Dude. Zynga is going to be great. They have invested insanely over the last few years which is why their stock price is so low.

>  Economists who would say "but why would someone make a decision that is bad for them?"

Yeah, and those economists would study this by performing experiments to figure out why people DO make decisions that are bad for them, or for their futures, or are short-term focused only. Economists don't try to redefine the word "rational."

> The gold price recovered, though, and dollars just keep getting devalued further.

LOL. Sounds great when you try to sell that pile of shit that way! "Sure there was an economic shock that caused huge difficulties, but what about a slow inflation rate!"

> But you would struggle to make a model that X% of people are going to just choose drugs over productivity because it isn't "rational" - and yet people choose it.

Yeah, so rather than ditching the rational actor theory, those hacks redefined words.

You can still itemize losses on retirement accounts if you close all accounts of the same type and your distribution < your total cost basis.  Most people don't do this because they actually have real retirement assets and don't want all of them taxed because of one shitty trade.  I'm guessing this doesn't apply to OP.

This is what I believe, and Citron evaluation solely is stemmed for short term and it clearly benefits them with the latest movement. It does not change NIO fundamentals or backing of the CCP. You either believe NIO will be the leader or very prosperous in EV of China, or you don't.  Clearly short term investors or new investors really showed their hand.  With the latest rejection, as this seems to be their first true test, i plan on anticipating for the next, and will likely sell my initial investment locking in profit, and revisit on the next "big" dip. This still doesn't seem like a massive dip considering they are still up in my expectations.  My expectations should mean nothing.

I think your post just made me more retarded than I already was. But look on a serious note, a bubble bursting and markets truly collapsing has to be triggered by something. The 2008 meltdown came from people unable to pay their shitty overpriced mortgages and then the subsequent impact on shitty mortgage-backed securities. The February 2020 meltdown came from virus concerns and rebounded semi-quickly. 

What will cause the current ‚Äúbubble‚Äù to burst? Sure there are some overvalued stonks here and there, but corrections happen all the time without a market collapse lol. Another collapse from rising virus counts? OK but vaccines are coming and lockdowns will be local and only in extreme cases where hospitals are hitting max capacity. There will likely be another stimulus bill after Buyden gets in. The only thing that causes a collapse is fucking civil war which...are we gonna treat that as a realistic possibility?

Have YOU read the report? There's no points in it besides:

1) Tesla lowered price on Model Y (not new information)


2) NIO stock too high IMO


3) Picture of a Tesla to fill some space


That's it. The fact that they called that shit research is laughable. I've written longer papers with more substance in 9th grade.
Why not both?

"As America has struggled through the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been difficult to find a path toward health.

Over the last few days, that path became a little clearer. We are closer to having an authorized vaccine to treat COVID-19.

Still, the question that so many of us have is ‚ÄúHow would I get that vaccine?‚ÄùCVS Health¬Æ has entered into a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We were selected as one of the official COVID-19 Vaccination Program Providers.

The United States government will make a supply of the COVID-19 vaccine available to CVS Health when authorized and available to administer in pharmacies nationwide. We will offer it to the public through our 10,000 locations, following established vaccine prioritization guidelines.

CVS Health is already working to enable administration of the vaccine once it is available for pharmacies nationwide.

We are proud of and thankful for the efforts of our pharmacists, nurse practitioners and pharmacy technicians. They have served many communities across the U.S. and helped conduct nearly 7 million COVID-19 tests. We know they stand ready to do the same thing when COVID-19 vaccinations are available."

Buy some PLTR shares and leaps you will make money.
look into the cape ratio of the market. Then look into what that indicates for future returns over the coming decade. Then recheck the logic that these companies that went parabolic for 10 years, will somehow be higher in the next 10 years.

All the time
Of course. Hence bull or Bear trap. Nio has more demand than it can deal with. Much akin to Tesla in the last couple of years. Which is what I think you were eluding to. Tesla tanked. Then went from 400 to 2k. Aligning ish with them moving manufacturing to China. Nio are already there. In a previous comment I also said about fast and loose with emissions because they back their mass manufacturing + exponential decay on kWh of renewables to go so carbon positive they reverse the effects. Chinese want to use their own products. EV has to be a ln imperative component in that narrative? Building additional factories to keep up with demand + you can't be big in China without state backing. 

Muchos kudos for a proper answer in wsb aswell.

Also over years not days. Looks daymn like a traditional bubble formation but long term the product is good and the Chinese love their own

Unless all these banks retract their price targets on NIO, no way it isn‚Äôt still going up. Unless they get OFFICIALLY accused of accounting fraud and not by some randos online.
$6000 to invest, going all in NIO and PLTR 60:40. Thoughts?

This could literally be about Tesla any time in the past.

Dude Tesla is almost $400B valuation. Just buy your Tesla puts.

Buy your Ford, gm, whatever calls. 

These dudes post these idiotic "dds" then brag about the one put they got that profited when the stock is up 500%+ and is not going to stop.

All those people who made money off Tesla puts? So fucking what? The easy money is riding the wave up. Not hoping to catch each dip because you magically think Ford or gms declining valuations dictate the future growth of other companies. 

Put some fucking positions up. I hate you guys so fucking much.

honestly not a bad move. probably will perform better than an index fund with covid lockdowns coming back and people flocking to the walmart to stock up before theyre in their houses all winter. revenue will be way up and the stock will keep climbing. also not a bad idea to toss it in a vaccine company. honestly just pick one, theyre all gonna go way up once all the companies vaccines are getting approved and distributed. its gonna happen eventually and a bunch of companies are gonna have vaccines on the market. pretty failsafe.
lockdown is more serious. Limitation sound childish. Freeze sounds like credit. Temporary restriction sound lame.
You guys know you aren‚Äôt even trading against people, just random computer programs that take your trade and then move the market against you. That‚Äôs why when you sell your option rather call or put it instantly becomes profitable!

They're activist shortsellers.

For all you NIO naysayers about NIO 5k a month car production and compare it to the legacy US automaker market caps.

Stocks are about future potential not current. Ford and GM are boomer stocks. Companies that can't innovate and grow. Hell, they need government loans to keep themselves aflot. If it were for free market reign they would no longer exist! People said crap about TSLA too but you naysayers are believers now right? Note TSLA made 6352 vehicles a month in 2016 and had a market cap of \~40 billion at the year end. Making 5k cars a month and greatly improving that month over month and in an bubble economy, 60 billion is not overpriced.

I do like them. I bought 200 worth of calls yesterday that surprisingly doubled in value today but it was more to add to my 5g portfolio. I like qc0m and er!c far more. Im hoping my 150C qc0m jan calls will be in the money so I can excercise 1 or 2 of them.

The ver!zon spending upwards of 15bn dec 8 on c band has very telling implications. Er!c declined to adjust/give a bullish 2021 outlook because these contracts don't exist yet but they will. Both the current and incumbent administrations are very focused on developing 5G infrastructure. We only have 55k 5g base stations ( i think china has 10x that and we need probably 30x that) so do the math there. I have been limited by past failures but I turned 500 from qc0m into 8k the last 3 months, that wasn't a lucky one time play either, more like buying on doubt. 

Skyw0rks and american t0wer will also benefit heavily from this. I rolled all my qc0m q3 ER beat proceeds from 2020 calls into spring calls and opened a position in TMob!le, as well as the aforementioned.

If the USA govt spends a trillion over the next few years in further building up 5G, these are the benefactors. Throw in enterprise spending, er!c wins (vaccine coupled by c!sco outlook was huge for er!c IMO). Throw in automotive 5G investment, qc0m gets a boost. Maybe the consumer level supercycle mobile is baked into qc0m to some degree, but thats just the tip and the margins they have √ó royalties is pure money. They spent ten years and tens of billions on R&D for this moment and now own the patents and won protection from the courts. If I didn't already buy dozens of leaps on er!c I would again. Patience is key.

Furthermore, when institutions start putting money back into equities (on a much larger scale), I think 5G will be immediate to intermediate benefactors as it's a supertrend and very safe, promising and lucrative.
Damn haha taking profits would‚Äôve been nice to save yourself the headache but i feel like there‚Äôs def some upside left in them. Diamond hand those mugs.
Hell I bought calls for Monday, 366-367 because of the trash I saw today. I figured why the fuck not this market is fucked anyway we pump on zero volume I wouldn‚Äôt be SUPRISED we open at 370

I commend you and encourage you to stay on the straight path of your journey. you only have one body and taking care of it is more valuable that all the money in the world. youre awesome for making the change and if you have the will in you to stop something as tough as smoking, you easily have the will in you to kick some ass in this market and make some generational wealth! good luck in the market and congratulations on quitting smoking. good things coming in your future!
LMAO no because I'm profitable every year but that is a funny comment.
SOLO covered calls? Premiums crazy
There is no bubble. In fact it is the opposite: There is a dessert. 

The hypervalations are actually offset unlike in bubbles by a lack of capital in other places. In other words these valuations are just super concentrated due to nowhere else you actually put the money.

WSB Version: With Fixed Income blown to hell all the other markets are absorbing asinine amounts of cash but there's nowhere to put it in the smaller markets either.

I listen to the full song everytime this meme template gets used.
Youre applying a lot of good logic to a potential outcome. It‚Äôs a risky play no doubt, but most of us here are into the risk. We aren‚Äôt here to make 5 - 10%, we‚Äôre here to make 1000%. And some have. Your risk aversion is probably a safe disposition, but gods aren‚Äôt made in safe spaces.

Funniest thing I‚Äôve seen today
I'm right there with you man. Bought at 20 and then stop loss hit at 42 as I wanted to preserve my 100%+ gains. Trying to celebrate the gains instead of thinking of the money that I probably left on the table
I know. I saw $CCL up 7% today and immediately bought in. If it goes higher on Monday, I‚Äôll load some more. Once Biden is announced they‚Äôll all go down back to $12-14 level.
Yeah it is one of the only stocks that dipped virtually not at all with covid and consistently just goes up.
So you're holding through ER? I'm bullish because of W+ but feel like if it even slightly misses expectations on it it's crashing hard.

I know margins for government are terrible. Government contracts profit are made up with man hours (why they have timecards and alot of "overtime") and restricted markups.

Sorry I did not mean to sound hostile. I do see CVS benefiting from not only Covid but they are a go to for Flu shots.

He was banned :( this is his new account
Bubble bubble cancels out. Because each bubble is within the everything bubble, things can only go up. 

Think of it like two wrongs don't make a right, only in this case they do. 

Boomers have been dribbling about stocks bubbles for years and we keep getting hooker and cocaine level gains each year.
I don't buy  clownass options (neither puts or calls) on dumb shit like Nio, Li, etc. that have 150-250 IVs unlike you degenerates do.   The options markets for  meme stocks is radioactive waste.
NVDA gonna bring it next week? Hopefully helps AMD, cause AMD been languishing for me.
okay Daniel Tosh
Yeah but no. I bought nio when it IPO‚Äôd and then decided to cut my losses when it took a dump for two years. Had I not done that, I would be sitting on a 627% return on stocks alone.
that was doooope.. loved learning how they film and design the sets / shots

r/dontputyourdickinthat
Serious or exaggerating?
Holding at my $23 buy in price a few weeks ago with the thought they would be at 50 dollars EOY or mid next year, so all this movement exceeded my expectations  and albeit to enticing to sell on my very green stock assessment, I am still in the green. This movement shows shakey hands looking for short term gains. Kind of wished I pulled my initial investment at 53.00, allow the free money to prosper and reinvest the profits back into NIO.
What day and time did you buy these? Seems like spy has been below $363 all week and never even made it to $363.. I‚Äôm confused. Just trying to make sense ofthis....

EDIT:  realizes you‚Äôre said 11/9 not 11/13 I see

But still what day did you buy? Want to see how nutty the bet was
You needed to inverse one more time.
memento mori
I'm gonna need a bigger plunger.
Well no that‚Äôs inaccurate. You just compile for a different architecture. Cross platform compilation is quite simple these days.  Many games engines natively support it (unreal, unity).  Games aren‚Äôt made for Linux because there‚Äôs no money to be made.
For sure I am buying right around 30 so any run up I will just take profits and maybe let some ride for the manned flight.
What was it trading at when you got em tho
Had a boatload of shares of NIO and XPEV. Just sold them. I paperhanded my NIO 45c Wednesday for a loss that would‚Äôve made me an extra couple grand yesterday. So pissed. Every great play I‚Äôve made on calls, I‚Äôve bought at the top then paperhanded to minimize losses and they only come back with some retard strength to what would have been a 10 bagger. Did it with ACB last week, NIO and XPEL (not XPEV) this week.

I bought LI at the top today. Those calls are fucked. All of em. Dipped 3 times on them.
#profit &go
No one wants to call it a lockdown anymore. 

They are calling it a "pause", "freeze", "limitation", "temporary restrictions" or other names so that the market doesn't get scared.
Im carrying March 150 calls. This could be the one that puts me over the top.

NIO was in the mid 20s. Morgan Stanley Analyst said it can go to 40. NIO rallied hard to lower 30s, took a breather then analyst said 46, then rallied up until now.  Morgan Stanley is conservative with EV Price targets.  This short seller is a guy known to be wrong with stocks. He shorted TSLA, PTON, ZM, SHOP, and more. He was also long Luckin. See a trend? Him shorting this means it is worth its weight in gold and will moon!
Uh, so what's your next move?
What‚Äôs ur rating
Moderna is just teasing us.  They announced on Wednesday they had enough cases to send to the independent review board.  What's taking so long?  You look at the cases and see if they had the placebo or the vaccine, easy peasy.
MRNA is planned to come out with vaccine data on Tuesday.
gonna drink myself this weekend. gn.
Don‚Äôt act like it won‚Äôt be 100 someday. You can just look at volume and price action without any fundamentals and realize it‚Äôs going to go crazy every time it says anything remotely positive. They have complete control of their own share price at this point. All they have to do is ask for money and it will come. Tesla had the same power.

Too many words. Ban
Damn, things happened today
You can turn 1k into 10k with this type of market every week tbh. I really think when you hold overnight that‚Äôs when you leave your ass exposed, futures are how MMs fucking rape retail every time. For instance today, was there a reason to be so green? Was there any good news? Nah logic dictates we should go down, any sane person would think so. So MMs squeezed the fuck out of every short. But if you could have for instance got into spy even when it was .8% up and held for an hour with some call you could have easily made 300-400 on 1k bet and just got out. Hell if you held till EOD you coulda probably made 100% and got out
elon musk spotted
DKNG gonna run next week dumbos.
no one here gives a fuck about the stimmy anymore. we made our stimmy this week in green stocks and theres more to make next week.
I bought NIO puts yesterday and was called a tard. Lol. I doubled down today
fuck I think I fucked up buying BABA weeklies, I chose it bc it was the only thing down. BABA gang how we feeling for Monday? Ma has to pull something over the weekend to save his stock right?
A lot of it is old money. Families that were ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù of the United States. Other families are successful founders of companies. For instance, (not a client so I can speak about them) the Waltons. Sam Walton wanted to create a supermarket that had a high inventory/low price method. Meaning instead of selling 10 items as a higher price, they sold 100 items for much less making profit. This became immensely successful and the fledgling company known as Walmart was born. 

Fast forward to Mr. Walton passing. His children each inherited roughly 20 billion dollars apiece. 

If money is managed properly, this 20 billion each child had received will trickle down for generations causing the entire Walton line to be in the upper echelon for generations to come.

Get familiar with python, shell (linux), powershell (windows), and basics of what functional testing, end to end testing, smoke testing, and general QA processes (for the QA person when doing your job) and you could be a shoe in. Its in between dev jobs and like customer support, so it tends to fall in between skill sets as those who know programming really well go for dev or software engineering roles and those with none but wanna work for a tech company go for customer support (I'm the former and my brother is the latter lol)
They could easily be at $20 within a few years, which is like 30% gains so better than expected!

Edit, didn‚Äôt see they listed at $10, I see them at $16.50 within 5 years.

I just realllllllly believe in Palantir. It goes back years when I started as a technical recruiter at an agency. The way these badass 0.1% cream of the crop engineers spoke about the company and wanting to work for them left and impression on me. I got into Okta early and made a lot of money via the same route, I knew Okta was a great company based off the hiring bar they had engineering and sales team wise. 

I just don‚Äôt see any conceivable way that this company loses me money one year from now. They might not meet my expectations which are quite lofty but there‚Äôs no way this is gonna drop below 10/per share ya know?

TSLA has been around for a relatively long time, when they first started ‚ÄúEV is the future‚Äù wasn‚Äôt really the narrative for most people except early investors. Also PLTR isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúbig data‚Äù company. They are willing to do the nitty gritty other data companies wont; hence their controversy but they also do their job well. They are heavily supported by government contracts so thats a cash cow right there. Their increase in the private sector, I think something like a 33% increase YoY. Talks about a Covid tracing program with the UK government. But data harvesting will only get bigger as internet off things is more prevalent in our lives.
Wait if you buy one call you can sell 2 calls? I thought it had to be 1:1 ratio

On the topic of big banks doing shady shit - Deutsche bank

https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/01/world/biggest-german-bank-admits-and-regrets-dealing-in-nazi-gold.html

>	The report said Deutsche Bank channeled gold transactions with the Reichsbank through branches in occupied Austria and Turkey, then a self-avowed neutral power. Of purchases totaling 4,446 kilograms of gold, the report concluded, 744 kilograms were dental gold taken from Jews' teeth, wedding bands and personal jewelry amassed in Berlin by an SS officer

I have my guesses, maybe like $40-46? But my goal is to hold this stock long term because I think China is super serious about their EV market.
lol i know the feeling. Started last month and instantly down 30% (didn't know jack shit and bought APHA and GME at their highs, APHA down 20% after ER) but I've been slowly learning and made it all back this week with some more (up 4% overall) so yeah hang in there. Just keep learning and you'll make them back as you get better (unless you don't). I save posts like the one below to motivate myself

I‚Äôve seen worse
People here buy expensive lotto tickets and don't know when to cut their losses nor when to take profits. Sometimes it pays off but more often then not it doesn't. With just 1k it is not unreasonable to rake in $100/day if you know how to make the right plays.

yep, this. not as dramatic, but i was down 20 something percent last week and got it all back and more this week, hoping for good things next week. looks like stay at home stocks are gonna be the tendie trains.

yeah I've been following it since I first traded (which was right before the crash lol) I made 10k on it and fell in love lmao. But haven't really traded it but I know  sorta the patterns. I think it's finally time to break out to 30 before another crash
your problem is that you've normalized exponential growth in your mind.

Yes. I bought yesterday. Never went green. I have a month. I‚Äôm hopeful for some profits now but not big profits. I‚Äôll sell if it goes green unless it‚Äôs doing some NIO shit.
Serious question, is there any way PLTR doesn‚Äôt successfully at least maintain a $15/share stock price? Can a govt contracted company really go bankrupt?
It will run up

Oh yeah for sure. I mean look at big Sean for example. Dude doesn‚Äôt have any crazy cool look. But according to the guy who put him on, he was super easy to work with and had really strong work ethic. Some of the most talented people I‚Äôve worked with on music (I used to run a recording studio) were assholes, weird, crazy, etc. and some of the most average talent were the coolest people and generally were the more popular artist in my city at the time.

Right before earnings? I am holding one call through earnings and selling the rest
Sold the the 43 calls at ~70% profit thanks to Cintrons bitch ass. I‚Äôm sitting on a few 40 PUTS. Maybe I can make it back up if the stock keeps dipping into earnings on the 18th...

Listen, you as an average shlub can‚Äôt do anything to stop Left. All you can do is buy puts on the shit he calls before it inevitably drops. Stop being cry babies about him making ur little stocky wocky go down and realize that his Twitter feed is a money printer. Short term only the dude isn‚Äôt actually right but you can‚Äôt deny he moves the market. Imagine if all investors on WSB followed one persons advice. That‚Äôs the level of pull Andrew left has on twitter.

Fuck it. Just gonna dump my savings into my account and buy into WMT. Boomer stock has consistent $1-2 gains each week and is basically Covid-proof. I‚Äôll have better returns than paperhanding would-be 10 baggers at a 40% loss.
I mean I agree that NIO at 54 was way too high but that‚Äôs what hype does. I think it‚Äôs a mid 40s stock at best but andrews valuation is way off. iirc one of the big investment banks valued it at 40+. What do you think it‚Äôll be at Monday and Tuesday?

Well.... in all seriousness I don't think this stock is worth $54. I believe the earlier price targets of $40-46. But then I believe in this company in the long term.

If you ever google "china desertification" you'll know that EV progress is a matter of existential threat to them. There's going to be a huge market and enough room for both NIO and Tesla.

The short sale was an obvious trash play. Anyone should have foreseen that today would be taking-profits day. All that Citron did was accelerate/push it.

Here's my post from this morning:

> "LI auto is up 25% premarket on earnings report, adding momentum to EV market. **If there's an earnings day on which EV day traders were looking to sell and take profits, it would be today.**

> "However, the momentum from the phenomenal quarter-on-quarter growth reported in the sector this month may provide a permanent leg up to recent IPO stocks..."

When did you buy that and when did you sell it?
What did the PRPL bagholders ever do to you?
So PLTR could really be the next really big thing huh..? I see so much belief in this company (haven't rly seriously done a dd on them yet) . question i guess is how much market cap can they achieve?

Majority of people here us RH, and I‚Äôd think A LOT of people use that trash brokerage. You couldn‚Äôt be more right, but once you have 25k in a margin acc, there‚Äôs no reason for not being extremely wealthy. 500-600 a day is more then possible, that‚Äôs an extra 2500 a week? Hell sometimes more or less it can depend but once you get it moving you can do good things. Seeing people here go from 50k to 0 kills me inside.

11/27 $30c
Too low imo
I've been trading in and out of it, not continously holding to avoid theta burn and lucky me the stock is pretty volatile even though its maintaining an upward trajectory
don‚Äôt crush my hopes
Because most of investment articles are written for two reasons:

* To generate clicks or
* To generate leads for some paid product

NIO is hot but there's not much analysis. The media/blogosphere was desperate for any content. So any bit of out of ordinary news comes out it's blown way out of proportion.

To be fair, NIO at $54 is kind of ridiculous. But then this Andrew guy's target of $24 is also way out of left field.
Can confirm. Picked up my last pdt foul too, to get out. Kickin a man while hes down!
Kept averaging down past month and a half. Finally just close all my long positions today. Down 50k on amazon for the year. Fuck Bezos. Also fuck me for being greedy and not exiting earlier.
The thing that will inflate or deflate the prices of stock based on industry is bond yields. 2/5/10yr bond yields going up means cyclicals will outperform, while 20/30yr bond yields decreasing means tech will outperform.
Only when I can afford it
Ever heard of NIO?
Well, unfortunately WSB is a bizarre and weird place.. filled with repetitive spammy nature..

The REAL bizarre part is why you don't want futures in the mix.. answer that one.

You want to keep futures away from WSB or something?

If PLTR is successful I foresee many similar startups sprouting up to compete. Many defense engineers are not happy they make alot less than their brothers in big tech. Foreigners can't really get in due to clearance requirements so it is more protected.
I bought more stocks.

Ehh it won‚Äôt be substantial but I‚Äôd be more worried about price moves at this point instead of theta decay

Mw3 was the second best cod
I discovered the formula:

Citron said SHOP was overvalued, 10/2017, around $100 at the time. 3 yrs later it goes to $1,100. 10X return 

Says the same about TSLA, 20X return 

Today, Citron says NIO is crazy overvalued. Using above logic, in 3 years, 15X return = $650
I clipped baba at $200/share in June on some panicky bullshit.. I was worried it would break south of $250 on more news coming out this week but think we avoided.. held it strong see upside.. saw a bunch of really big orders come across my scanner too.. go in with the whales

You definitely said wave. It‚Äôs not my fault you deleted your comments post. Due diligence is about posting the research you‚Äôve done so others can analyze it. You definitely said you wanted to start the wave and that you had bought puts when it was at $54. Good luck trading! Can‚Äôt wait to hear you tell people how stupid they are for not buying calls.      

Why are you posting about meme stocks that 1,000,000 other people have already posted about? Nio is getting old.
No bullshit, IF quarantining works, we need to just do super strict for  14 days nationwide. Make it lowkey illegal to disobey it.

People have the right to choose but the government has made not wearing a seat belt illegal so the precedent is set.

It wasn‚Äôt a healthy pullback. It was a flash crash from smooth brains selling without knowing why.

Nio and spy calls
Highly doubt they'd even try for it let alone it getting past the senate.
Don‚Äôt give up, kids. My account was 95% down last week, but I‚Äôm up all time now. Weed stocks, SPY‚Äôs autism, and a bit of luck brought me back. I can‚Äôt believe it almost. But 10 baggers are all around us, children. If you only believe.
Who ever didn‚Äôt buy nio at the dip today is braindamaged
It might not because big money bought this week already. Now it is a bit overpriced. Fair price is 13, but with hype and big money buying 15-16 is reasonable. If PLTR is successful in growing there will be alot more defense oriented software companies. Defense pays engineers poor wages in comparison to big tech. Foreigners can't get in the action to it is more of a protected market.
The government buying tests is not directly correlated with more profits for you FYI

This is the way
Low-capital peeps are missing out by not using a broker that allows option trading with cash accounts. Funds from option trades settle overnight. This means you can day trade every day. The only limit is the number of plays you can make in a day and the limit is determined by how much settled funds you have in that given day to play with. Which is not really a downside when you consider the fact that you can fucking day trade without 25k. 

PSA: Robinhood doesn't allow option trading with a cash account!

I'm super new to this so you shouldn't listen to me, but I think it may have dropped because a lot were simply satisfied with their earnings & possibly even because it's the weekend. I think next week may even produce bigger gains as word regarding NIO continues to spread leading to people running to hang on to the departing train.

Could be wrong. I'm super new so I don't know what I'm talking about.

Good luck!

You realize that if "theta gang" is selling you CCs it means they own a ton of stock right? I'm raking in the juicy 200% IV premiums right now too but it doesn't mean I have a bearish assumption.
Guess who sold before its dump, bought back at 8.58 and sold at 10.72, big profit as an update

Alright tards, should win on appeal but they gave me 9 months suspended. Am an American that owns a brewpub in Argentina. Group came in being rowdy and introduced myself as the owner. Treated them good and even bought them a round of beers. They continue being rowdy and another chick smashes a beer glass over the chicks head. The smasher left in a cab, cops come and ask what happened and this chick says the owner did it. Wants 300,000 pesos for me ‚Äúnot to have it on my record‚Äù at the beginning. I say fuck that shit, I didn‚Äôt do shit, let‚Äôs go to trial. She asks for 50,000 pesos and apology right before ZM trial. Lawyer says it‚Äôs pretty set in stone that I should be found not guilty. Tell her I won‚Äôt pay her shit and the woman judge couldn‚Äôt see how fucking ridiculous this was. Held my ground and will continue holding my ground but I ain‚Äôt paying this bitch nothing. So yeah, let‚Äôs see if there is any justice in this world. Spoiler alert, there isn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm retarded.

Upvoting cuz it sounds smart and has a few upvotes. Calls on this reply
Not sure myself. I panicked like everyone else when it dropped today but after realizing it was Citron sabotaging the stock I felt a lot better. I doubled up on shared when it hit -14.5%.  But I think itll run next week into earnings and Calls would be the play

I heard a story about someone saying they were a driver for limo service hired for him and he actually got 2 vehicles to take him home from the airport and everything but a single back pack went with him in the first one.  Everyone in the chat at the time was saying coke was in the second vehicle.  Said guy was a grade A douche who didn't say a word to anyone.  Probably was on here actually so probably all made up.
Not only did MM eat it up, he made a fortune.

Went up 85% in a week? 20% is not bad, especially on a Friday before earnings after a slander piece with little factual backing. I foresee NIO hitting 60 after earnings. WITNESS ME

Yaa... and she also bought 2.3 million shares of IPOB and that stock's just been limp dick for the past couple weeks.
Yeah the worst that can happen is you are feeling lazy the next day.
At least Nikola had factual reporting though. They didn't do anything blatantly illegal it's just some people were dumb enough to buy into their advertising.

Meanwhile companies like Luckin Coffee literally fabricated revenue data in their earnings reports.
How's the new CoD?
NIO:  
90% sales from shirts  
10% sales from Vehicles

CVS was trading at 7 times earnings this summer for no good reason. If you needed the CDC to point out they would deliver the Covid vaccine well thats on you. They wont shoot up on any news but will steadily rise to 80 ish

No.  Honestly only a minority of people (outside Reddit) want loan forgiveness.  People who actually paid off their student loans instead of buying a new car would be upset.

No doubt  INO (back then but not sure now) and NIO were hyped. I'm not contesting the accuracy of their analysis. But damn, the timing...it's like I'm gambling and expecting a good hand but Citron comes by and flips the table over. 

I guess you can short if you catch the news early enough or have inside knowledge of the unannounced rating...which is my point. 

But I see your point. They must be fun at parties.
Any justification on the sudden drop AH in BABA? If it happens one more time I'd hit SL and my life be ruined.
it will go down into and after earnings but probably bounce back into 2021
[deleted]
‚ÄúOne healthy pullback.‚Äù It literally tumbled 20% lol.
Valuation frontloading. Basically Tesla is worth 500/share *in three years* rather than today. Nio and all these other companies are essentially at start-up level and are now midcap prices. If Nio hit 100 EOY it is frontloaded and like Tesla will stall out. 

You can't sustain a valuation without some level of compensatory production.

It's all about managing. Creating wedges and getting people to turn against one another.

The last decade with the gig economy and dismantling of labor rights has really set off a purge.

So now you have people on instagram posting about their lives and how busy they are with hashtags like team no sleep etc. So if you're not part of the hive it's like well you're lazy or not a team player.

Then you have the push towards services. Oh man you're so busy don't even bother shopping or doing housework or even filling up your own gas tank. Focus on working 12 hours a day for $25/hr but don't worry you'll make it soon enough. 

Of course then people fall for this and the cycle continues.

It's a drip here and a drip there but if you even believe in the con for a second it's all over.
This is the way.

Apple won't touch any real processor companies in terms of power. The "beats 99% of laptops" is fluff, look at what they tested. They were running the Apple laptops on lower specs while cranking the others. Really bad for longterm.

Why the hell are retail investors so fickle these days about stocks. Earlier this year most did  not sell off on fears. Now they want to sell off due to a known short seller report? I read comments many bought at 45+ and sold at just above 41. It is amusing how a few weeks ago a more reputable analyst at Morgan Stanley said this could be worth 40, the revise to 46 and now it is forgotten for a short seller?

Wallstreet/professional analysts are wrong often especially with disruptive companies. They were dead wrong with Tsla. Retail investors were the ones who beat them to the punch and now these institutions want in on the China EV craze before they miss out.

I bought 15k worth of calls at 52, lost 10k 10 minutes later
Ain‚Äôt even gonna move the stock much. Boomer stocks are wack.
I think it‚Äôs about damn time for a 10% spaceship inspired rally monday for $tsla
Nope still have my original stash.

I‚Äôd actually feel pretty confident about moderna‚Äôs calls. You‚Äôre just a vaccine announcement away from banking. That or another bond rate increase for 5/10yr bond yields.
Except it never happened, I shorted at 35$, been waiting for a squeeze so I can load more before December‚Äôs lock up period
Have to have killed right?
I‚Äôll take $50 and you can give me your account
Earnings strangles is a great way to get boned, lol. I like to sell IC's into earnings. Wins pretty often tbh.

I almost never don't do a spread, but I do usually leg out asymmetrically. Worth the commissions to protect your entry
340ish
Bloomberg terminal for short term trade, it is useless.

Market doesn't react to new information all equally. wasting money if you don't like to read long FD.
That's what I'm doing.
Lemme see ur puts bitch
I bet $160. Still no pay out...
[deleted]
737 being ungrounded will likely make BA pop and this news expected by the 18th. Every vaccine news makes BA pop. Remember this stock was over 400 pre pandemic. Its not a boomer stock if it could have a legit 100% upside. Wait sorry I am a fucktard NIO NIO NIO

All my boys say fuck shitron
Nope due to covoid shutdowns.
Earnings call is on the 24th, the 19th was a mistake.

Hahahahahaha 

Y‚Äôall are surprised about this? This is his game. There are more like him. It sucks to lose but who did you think you were playing against? Of course short sellers are going to come after NIO.
This not not satire, this is loss your trying to sugar coat. Dont be a bitch and just post your loss porn, with dignity
I would actually. However, I used too vallet and never got to park a Lamborghini, even thought they would come from time to time.
The floor is 40. Morgan stanley stated stock is worth 40/46 and they are conservative with EV stocks meaning this is worth 50+

Dude, [here's the graphics bench](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/cpu_benchmark-igpu_fp32_single_precision_gflops-11). Note the distant third. Note the competition in the test is only CPU integrated units that are blown out of the water for gaming by AMD and Nvidia dedicated GPU chips (note where it is when it's competing against [dedicated GPUs](https://browser.geekbench.com/opencl-benchmarks), M1 scores 18406 on that bench, so it's gonna take some scrolling). The M1 is not going to make a ripple in gaming any time soon.
theres tendies for everyone
Awww that's sweet
Buddy, every time I sell covered calls the stock starts rocking.  Do it if you want the stock to go up.
I‚Äôll wait to buy after earnings whether puts or calls. Less iv crush risk and more chance I can swing trade the next day moves

While you say this whole citron research team is a big sham i‚Äôd say the market doesn‚Äôt agree with you at all. You listed a few people talking shit about them and completely left out what they‚Äôve uncovered and exposed over the last five years. Do more research. You‚Äôre wrong. The market siding on the side of Citron and not you should be enough evidence.

Earnings are the 24th, so make sure your weeklies are for that. They just confirmed that like today I think, if they do crush the short squeeze will he something tho

I feel like pfizer wasn't even supposed to get any credit for the vaccination. They got on the news and bullshit a lil so the guy could make his play. Why didn't Biontech just make the announcement?
yes. you can get game pass for like $5 or $10 a month. get a PS5 for their exclusives, which is weird from the 180 they've done from years ago.

Sold my puts ZM puts today for a 80% profit, easiest peasiest $100k of my life. A lockdown is inevitable at this point, the vaccine is months away at a minimum and hospitals will be filled within a few weeks at this rate. ZM calls on this dip, sell at the top at $550ish, buy $350 March puts and sell for 500% profit when vaccine hits.

too bad it went red after today. still holding on as my contract doesnt expire until a few months out. NIO numbers should be good.
Yup. I was going to hold off until later in the month, as the Thanksgiving cases won't be picked up immediately (likely very early Dec), but I wanted exposure to the fallout from Trump's ongoing meltdown.
fuck yeah. well done... I know everybody else is pissed but im happy for ya.

But didn‚Äôt they say that the buyback was spread over two years?  I believe this is a $22 stock, once you get a mortgage you‚Äôre no longer a prospect for 30 years; yes the low rates have helped with new refinancing customers but if those rates go up, that cash pool is closed.  The only good news about this current stock price is that they shouldn‚Äôt really drop down too bad if they ever miss an earnings.  I don‚Äôt see it taking off until they continuously increase market share  for several more quarters.  I also hope I‚Äôm wrong since I‚Äôm holding too!
I heard Hudson capital but haven‚Äôt really looked into it much
Citron has a massive short position in Tesla at $400, guess they haven't learned.

Oh course not Elon musk is king, but he‚Äôs one of a kind. But you‚Äôre thinking about it wrong. Its not a long term position it‚Äôs for the literal day movement. Did NIO not fall today? Is there not an immediate reaction to what they say. Stop being a cry baby and use your big boy brain

Realistically, a week is probably super optimistic lol. There are other things that will probably still get it to run up next week, so it's still a good play. I would just avoid super retarded strikes if you're playing November exp dates. FAA approval does seem like a pretty good bet by EOY though. Maybe like 75% chance if I had to put a number on it. I like Jan 2021 calls for the super retarded strike plays.

Do you understand the word ‚Äúdrastically‚Äù? If not, here it is. Drastically: in a way that is likely to have a strong or far-reaching effect. I‚Äôm saying Lulu in the next week will go either -/+20%. A drastic change as I said in the previous comment, but you seem to not understand.

WSB Retard 3- You got both ordered? I was only able to order the crappy xbox and it won't come till december.

Me- You guys are getting the new systems?
Even just looking at earnings and the response they got plus ARK buying a fuck ton of shares you can be sure this is going to be a winner long term.
Who?
Considering I'm all in on NIO for earnings it should definitely tank Monday and Tuesdays to kill off any calls that are left. Inverse me for massive tendies
Is BABA going contiune to dump?
he's saying buy puts and calls
Paper hands
yoo what are some freezer plays for storing the vaccines

I don't mind next week deep red so I can get in thiel's no profit company
When the puts you sold go deep in the money, and you get assigned over the weekend. That's called having kids in real life.
Politics thread is over. Move the fuck on.
That sounds a lot safer tbh. I have only bought naked options I‚Äôve never tried spreads. I play earnings with strangles but that‚Äôs about the most I‚Äôve done. I think all EV stocks will crash this week I believe today was the top for NIO this week.
Yeah but also that chick on season 2 of Holey Moley was robbed

I don't particularly agree on the age part. When I was in that age category, I knew going into major debt for an arts degree with no guanrantee of anything was a stupid idea. I did 3 years of post secondary. First 2 were at home at a college so it was dirt cheap. 3rd year, I went to a university out of town. I didn't graudate. Had I gone into 4th year, I probably would have ended up being in about $10,000 worth of debt and to me, it wasn't worth it for a sociology degree.

After 3rd year, I had nearly $0. No debt tho. I moved back home and have been living here for year and a half now. Landed some good jobs along the way and now I have about $40,000. $0 to $40,000 in 1.5 years. Would be sitting on about 50 if I didn't panic sell so much like a true WSB autist lol

People with literally no credit shouldn't be given so much loans. The same people with thousands in student loans would never qualify for a $10000 line of credit. I don't agree with the age part because at 18, they are considered adults legally and age doesn't equate to maturity, or decision making skills. 

Society does encourage people to go into post secondary. But it's up to the individual to make a decision on how they want to carry on with their life. Most degrees are literally worth less than most people's portfolios on here. I know plenty of people who finished their degrees in engineering, arts or science. Where are they now? In debt, underemployed, without a high paying job to make up for their expensive education. The only useful bachelor's where I am is in nursing or anything healthcare; they get job offers straight out of school.

The system definitely needs to be fixed up
They really don't want them to smell

Rationale for IWM puts:

* No stimulus before Feb
* Ballooning cases coming into Thanksgiving and Christmas
* Biden likely to shutdown country if suggested by public health officials
* Smallcap less capable of surviving second shutdown

But I'm sure there will be massive lobbying behind the scenes at large companies. Just like politics.

Was going to buy ZM calls went with BA puts instead...
Good week all. I was banned all week for saying the R word. Careful making fun of the prema-bears.
Floor is 40. So many retail investor got spooked and sold but regret  especially those who bought at the peak.
Booze is better imo. Pot doesn't make it as clear how intoxicated you are imo
Who else is retarded enough to hold spy puts?
How‚Äôd you manage that? I already sleep 4-5hrs a night as it is

That was a brutal massive all day squeeze, possibly to prepare for a big drop early next week before monthly expiration???

Backpacking idea sounds very cool.

Instacart is an odd business. I only use it when I get coupons but if you already have a sam's membership isn't it easier to just take a half and hour and shop?
Andrew Left new Fed Chair
Let me know what you think.
That was the plan. I might buy some puts Monday morning to feed off some idiots. Or I‚Äôm the idiot for buying calls.... Well see lol.
CHWY gang leggo
420 would be awesome
instacart is a shitty company to work for, and its not worth it compared to lyft or uber. The batches are few and far between with shit pay outs.

It has a boomer interface like no other for actual workers too.

dont expect them to last.
Many could walk outside without having trouble breathing. I have friends who live there who say they normally avoid going outside as much as possible because it irritates their lungs.

Yeah I think with ant valuation puts it easy over $300 back on enevelipe.. people scared bc of antitrust drafting in congress? Will take years to develop and China on global scale wants to flex muscles.. best shot of a pissing match on the equity markets is to prop baba.. plus the sales they just put up in their sales event were belligerent
X, y: no correlation
looks like I‚Äôm going to have to climb Mount Everest just to get out the whole I‚Äôm in
!remindme ....how long?
Negative missy. The only gay here is those with puts trying desperately to keep avoiding the inevitable.
It almost felt like the antitrust rules were targeting PDD's method to sell cheap goods. That being said PDD also went up 28% or something in the past two days so who knows.
Seems like it got plenty of others engaged. Sorry it concerns you so much.
With the share price ramp in Chinese EV ADRs, and their lack of profitability... does this basically mean NIO, XPEV, and LI are taking western investor money and giving the upside to Chinese consumers?

Just asking because I saw this sentiment on Weibo, with users calling NIO as the ultimate nationalist company.
We made it!

Or they keep their eyes out for companies pumped up to much by hype and short them down. I‚Äôve been following citron for years. If you aren‚Äôt shorting what they say you‚Äôre dumb. Now I know your gut reaction is to be mad because they made your stock go down. But they made your stock go down. They can do that. And they tell you when they‚Äôre going to do that if you follow them. You could get mad about it, or you could take advantage of it.

Algos probably dump anything in the same industry. It is stupid NIO/LI/XPENG/BYD  will be worth as much as TSLA due to China demand. TSLAs can be cheap enough for China. In addition, once India starts to accumulate more wealth, they are bound to adopt cheap EVs too. China EV expansion to US and Europe will change the game. Sure they don't have the prestige of a TESLA, but they will be cheaper. It is harder to go wrong with electric motors compared to engines.

I‚Äôll tel you right now, the masses won‚Äôt get vaccines until December 2021 and we don‚Äôt know if antibodies are even effective and if gene mutation warrants current experiments pointless..

Somebody give this guy a pity fuck
Wow I didn't know about that unethical short seller.
I don't have anything against people doing real investigations and sharing them with the public.

But this Citron report is simply exaggerating what in his opinion is an overvalued stock. Nothing new, no research, no secret discovered, the bottom line of the report is NIO is overvalued for blah blah.

So what. There are gazillion of companies ultra-overvalued these days. So what.
Calls mean you win money puts mean you lose money

NIO will rocket. Citron shorted Shopify to 100, and they surpassed 1000. They did the same with Tesla, same result. Consider this a good omen.

I just want enough to not worry about the future. Uber works fine.
Do you have any sources where I could read more into the theory you mentioned?
The idea is that as it‚Äôs spread around the country more, and factories are hot spots, supply chain issues are more likely to occur.
Lol you may actually be braindead. This isn‚Äôt some NKLA fraud or Zoom meme stock. This is a company that consistently makes a lot of money.

Also, the price of each opt nearly doubled from here at one point... so the peak of this hypothetical buy would‚Äôve been ~18k. OOOOOOF
Not only timing but also context....they cited valuation as problematic. Nio is backed by the Chinese govt it will grow into its valuation
Stick to 9 month calls on Visa, Walmart, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, NVidia... 

Stop buying calls with like two to six weeks left before expiration.
When your only income is retard calls and you have 4 cents, yeah 6 months is about right.

I was more neutral/bearish to Chinese EVs but I have come around to be 100% bullish the more I understand the market. China must adopt EVs for their air quality and the government mandated it. They realized how much cleaner the air is without so much pollution during cvoid-19 lockdowns!

I just started researching this company after all the hype I've been seeing. They have a [press release from Oct 2018](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/10/29/1638305/0/en/Electra-Meccanica-Announces-Vehicle-Pre-Orders-Now-Exceed-64-000-Units.html) about their pre-orders exceeding 64k. At a price of $18,500 per vehicle, that's $1.1 Billion in potential revenue (napkin math). I guess you could argue those pre-orders are even higher now, and there's definitely a lot of hype around this company.

They only have a [single public filing](https://investors.electrameccanica.com/press-releases/detail/123/electrameccanica-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial) showing revenues under $1 million and some serious business risks as seen in this [Form 6k](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_75713222011490ae5e2206e1c6d9d6a4/electrameccanica/db/370/2784/interim_report/20-34969-1_v003_ELECTRAMECCANICA+VEHICLES+CORP_6-K+-+Draft_7.pdf):

*We have no revenue from the sale of electric vehicles and we will require a significant amount of capital to carry out our proposed business plan to develop, manufacture, sell and service electric vehicles. There is substantial doubt as to the ability of our Company to continue as a going concern.*

*We incurred a net loss and comprehensive loss of $29,736,379 and $29,776,051 respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and a net loss and comprehensive loss of $30,742,311 and $30,676,101, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2019. Although we had a cash and cash equivalents and a working capital surplus of $101,054,943 and $105,791,318, respectively, as at September 30, 2020, and of $11,095,848 and $15,478,918, respectively, at December 31, 2019, we believe that we will need significant additional equity financing to continue as a going concern, given that, among other things:* 

*‚Ä¢ we have begun the commercial production or sale of our flagship vehicle, the SOLO, and we expect to incur significant rampup in costs and expenses through the launch of the vehicle;* 

*‚Ä¢ we anticipate that the gross profit generated from the sale of the SOLO will not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses, and our achieving profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to materially reduce the bill of materials and per unit manufacturing cost of our products; and* 

*‚Ä¢* ***we do not anticipate that we will be eligible to obtain bank loans or other forms of debt financing on terms that would be acceptable to us.***

&#x200B;

All that said, the memes might be enough to get it to $12 before it fizzles out. Good luck if you decide to play it!

We can have a little correction though, as a treat
Yeah, how do you miss an ugly fat face?
Okay man, either you're good at this or really lucky. Either way, if you just take 80k of that and do theta gang, get some slow and steady grind, just in case you got lucky, and it blows up, you still got 80k left. If you're a lucky idiot, then you still grew 10k to 80k. If you're a savant, you'll be able to make that 20k into another 100k in a month anyways.

Unless you owe a mil to the mob and it's due next week, or if you're already obscenely rich so that a 100k loss won't affect you, go theta gang with some wsb style buying on a smaller chunk of your money

You sure?  Everything from Bloomberg to Yahoo has this shit trading at over 160 a share from Dec 2015. I think Robinhood might be a little fucked dude. Unless its tracking a huge split or something that isnt registering anywhere else.

Edit: IPOd in May of this year. Up over 30 percent since then but I'm not liking this company. Too much EV saturation will kill them. Remind me to drink my own piss if it's over 25 bucks a share by this time next year.

Anyone else secretly hoping for a deep red day so they can buy calls before this shit keeps grinding up??

I was hoping PTON would dump harder than $100 so I could buy more, There is very little selling pressure under $100, mostly just low volume slump then charges right back up past $100

All ITM Leaps is best route. Say the stock is $15 so $1500 - you can buy 5c leaps for around $1100. So if you have $15,000 to invest (1000 shares), you can buy 1,300 shares worth of 5c leaps for less. Of course, if stock ends up below 5 you no longer have any value in calls.

Allowing 18/19 year olds with no life experience to take tens of thousands of dollars of loans shouldn‚Äôt be legal. Your brain doesn‚Äôt fully develop until you‚Äôre 25, which is why those younger than that tend to have horrible decision making skills. Hence allowing society/schools/adults to pressure them into going to college and gaining a stupid amount of debt.

Things in the way of oil companies are potential lockdowns (some already happening) and if Dems win Georgia in January runoff. We will need hydrocarbons for a long time but if these things happen then it will take longer for them to get out of a rut. I don‚Äôt see them breaking their ATHs again unless they are the ones actually making breakthroughs in alternative energy (which some like XOM are researching). I have my eyes on natural gas pipelines and diversified downstream companies like PSX but I am scared to buy right now. Another lockdown would absolutely fuck the oil industry.

Anybody check out Soros Fund (George Soros) 13F released today? Completely dumped the whole financial sector. Pretty bullish on industrials.
Do you want to watch me jack off?
I chose spy earlier because 358 is along the trend line of every drop since 2016. Surprisingly we hit and closed right there today, so I am holding my loss and assuming this time will **not** be different. And yeah usually individual stocks are easier but this market has been completely correlated on average up or down days. It's rare for one stock to move without the whole market moving lately so at the time I considered not far out the money puts a safe bet. Someone also made a giant 500k spy 290/300 put bet after my purchase so maybe something is brewing.

Yeah it indicates we‚Äôre going to fall into a recession and or bear market

The McRib indicator

But I think it actually is bullish when it is first announced and then when it comes into place the bad times are here

I guess the idea is mcd can predict the recession with all their internal sales numbers.

The other possibility is they have a baby boom cycle of cows so periodically they have to get rid of a bunch of extra ones

Absolutely yes. We spend so much time sleeping.  $700 isn‚Äôt even that expensive. Is it a memory foam?
I agree, it isn‚Äôt the BEST course to take. But since it is happening, the purchase of $1 billion in shares is bullish. That alone deserves a slight pump.

I'm not talking about the shape. I have an xbox controller too but this is completely different. The rumble and feedback is soooo different (in a good way). The triggers provide force feedback.

Sure, but the question is whether or not the buyback is the best way to return to investors. They have a unique position where they have tons of cash, that won‚Äôt last forever as refinancing will drop once interest rates rise again in a few years. IMO they should be acquiring businesses that fit well in their portfolio. Share buy backs are lame.

I'll give you the advice I give everyone 25 and under, male or female.

Bi-weekly refresher for why the market won't tank and why your puts are fucked:

1. People are **desensitized** to Covid news. It's just not that bad for market sentiment.
2. We have multiple quarters of **strong earnings** in tech (large portion of indexes) and other sectors in a Covid world.
3. Market is **forward looking**. Therapeutics are here, vaccine is coming, uncertainty is dwindling.
4. **Fed** is committed to propping up the market indefinitely.
5. **0% interest rates** for foreseeable future.
You must not realize that certain places require a certain number of staff. Temp agencies must be rolling in it now.
My dad is a self made millionaire, probably spends $100k per year. He wears shirts until they have holes in them.

My stomach curdles at the thought.
IPOs aren‚Äôt just for raising capital (as you probably know). They also give liquidity to early investors and employees.
I agree. I thought you might've went big on a SPY put position trying to cash in a crash. I was just saying it's easier to capture a trend with an individual underlying than an index like SPY these days. For all intents and purposes there were several moments in the last two weeks where it should've declined but didn't. I agree we'll see a downtrend to 320, but from what I'm seeing it looks like it's more probable we'll see that drop in Jan or February. Or who knows, you could be right,, could be next month.

I mostly sell put credits on stocks that, IMO, are kinda battered. Or I do 1-2 week directional SPY debits that I leg out of when I think the intraday momentum will favor my play

I get fucked way too often chasing lol. But I like the suggestion. I'd have made bank chasing say TTD, CRM, XPEV etc.
Yeah, my leaps are just sitting there. Hoping for good 12 sales over the holiday. Not losing at least and I can dump these for a better play.

I guess I'm baffled that recovery can happen just by dangling a stimulus bill. If anything the position is worse now than it was before.

PLTR calls at 18 and 20.5 11/20. Either gonna hit?
Legalize it, tax it, maintain health standards and check visas. That's what they do where I live and it's not an issue at all.
Definitely this. FAA approval in a week will trigger an absolutely retarded run up.
McRib returns December 2nd

Don't even tell me you aren't eating that shit. Idc about your "it's not that good" fake news. You're eating it.
its either gonna be the next retard strength tesla or a pump n dump. which one it is, only time will tell.
I bought 3 shares at 44 to satisfy my FOMO, not touching options on this one

Teams is pure Microsoft bloat.   That shit loves going zombie and eating up all your memory.
I mean Tesla lol that went up more
You must be right. The article is from 2018, forget about the 2 bil. Its around 67k now. But still buy the hype üõ´
Am I the only one who **really** dreads getting married? I mean I'm 19 but ugh just the thought of it sucks. The ceremony and everything. And 50% end in a divorce anyways.
If you intend to sell then all the best mate hope it does goes lower and not continue mooning and never look back. 

Just a friendly advice, despite having an 8% run today, it may still very well shoot above 16 at the start of the day and never dip back to 16 again. I've personally miss out on the opportunity (not FOMO on NIO or something) of buying 3 diff stocks at a price I thought they will fall back to after 3 days bull run. They've never returned to the price I hope even after hoping for weeks and I am disappointed since. 

Although statistically speaking they will probably drop, but a friendly caution is not to let small potential gains cloud out the bigger picture. Cheers.
Bought my first options today. PLTR 01/15 21c. Too high?
PLTR obviously. It survived its first ER and went up.
Not sure what you‚Äôre getting at here. SPY up 16% on the year after getting juiced to the gills. That‚Äôs baby gains compared to what stocks have done this year.

I threw it in my "meme stock" watch-list; can probably make some money off it on it's way up to certain doom.  The thing to think about these types of vehicles is who's going to use them, where are they going to use them, and can they pass state safety standards (classify as car or motorcycle?).  I know they have some car designs as well but if they haven't gotten the 3-wheeler out yet, clearly 4 is (at least) one too many.
Just so you and everyone on this sub know, Nio has international offices. In Oxford they have their formula E team which does automotive research. In San Jose, California, they have an office doing advanced research, probably self driving technology. They're not shooting in the dark.

I get the abstraction of speed and time but just can‚Äôt see how it relates to options in a fundamental way. I‚Äôve personally always thought of volatility to be loosely dependent upon very large group psychology and the inherent chaos of large systems. Then again I probably don‚Äôt understand your idea as well as you‚Äôd hope

They are responsible for tracking your every movement. After much deliberation, I decided I‚Äôm morally against investing in them. If you want a buy-and-hold immoral stock, look into GEO. It‚Äôs private prisons that give 20% dividends.

volatility isn't a "thing" in and of itself. it's an extension of 2 other properties being expressed.
I‚Äôve been wanting to play it but I‚Äôve just been snorting lines of pure NIO. Maybe next week
I stretch it out that far the loss is $8700.  A single negative setback on the vaccine front when there are 200k cases a day and the house of cards comes down, I‚Äôm holding my -90% positions but it doesn‚Äôt look good.
I was expecting a part where a character named "earnings" comes in and fucks them up.
I feel like even for Musk, the 1k shirt is pointless to buy, no shirt has that kind of value so there isn't any point in him buying it. Now if he wanted to buy [this shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dlzdZlbq2Q) \- it might be fun to own one, and even this isn't 1k.
I'm theta gang, and I have a good chunk of rkt assigned from their last er. I'm past my break even with premium collected but well under my assigned price (those Sept premiums were great) and I'm just going to continue collecting absolute shit premium every week by selling above my assigned price cause I really think this shit has to go up. When I'm doing a nio or dkng or whatever other potential growth stock or meme stock with higher risk I'll sell and wheel safer, even if I get assigned on the call if it takes off (sold 800 shares of nio at 19), but this shit will go up and I'm content to sit on my shares with my shit covered call premium cause on the off chance they rocket up I wanna hold this, though I expect a slow grind up
nice!!!!!   im up only 5k but i did sell half... no strings attached now... letting er ride

It's going to moon after earnings. We've been talking about this all month. What is it with these buffoons thinking their puts are finally going to print?

I think most people don't get enough opportunity to fully experience leisure, so they don't quite understand its nature. Leisure, eventually, becomes boring. You run out of things to do. Rest feels much better after exercise, and can even hurt if you're just laying there too long. Being productive, in moderation, is a natural pursuit that is difficult to resist over long periods.
There has to be a correction, but trying to time it is futile IMO. It‚Äôs gonna keep going up until it doesn‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs likely to come out of nowhere when it finally does crash. My strategy is to ride the wave and take profits as I go, so as to not get caught with my dick in my hand when the music stops.

I sold at 25 and regretted so much that I bought in yesterday. I got greedy and left it thinking it‚Äôd keep going up because if earnings hype but citron fucked me. Basically lost all the gains I made off it originally. But I might buy back in on Monday

There's an old quote from an anonymous being that goes "Those who say money can't buy happiness, simply don't know how to spend it". Coming from a not so endowed beggings, I can say that I'd really rather feel sad in my Mercedes and go home to a comfy bed, than be sad, stressed, and depressed and hungry on a sidewalk (which I felt first hand).
I don't know what has changed since September 3rd, but supposedly we're doing much better now

Hope none of you got manipulated playing NIO today. I know some people made $ with puts, but make no mistake...NIO will kill earnings. 50c 11/20 are still going to reel in the dough. I dont buy FDs and my NIO calls don't expire for 2 more years.

Filthy rich like Musk buying a $1000 t shirt is perfectly fine imo. Your income or net worth has nothing to do with how you handle money it seems; hence, the basement millionaire.

I've met so many people with good income live cheque to cheque because of their dumb finances. Buying Supreme clothing, brand new vehicles you can barely afford, eating out every day, fancy vacation etc. But the way I see it, there's only so much money out there. If these idiots want to pump up the market for us, I'm cool with it

Dividends are also taxed as capital gains, so you're gonna hold onto a larger chunk of that scratch.
People still watch this shit ?
ok so y'know how there's a numerical symbolic representation that is abstracted to the concept of time?

alright so that's not the only abstracted concept.

there's abstraction of what we would recognize as the physical property of speed (which is itself dependent upon the concept of time but that's a tangent).

ok so with time and speed we get the concept of volatility. commonly represented in options as the perception of expected volatility of a future event.

well it's really just a measure of the speed. across time.

...

does that make sense?
I think unfortunately for you, you‚Äôre about to lose money next week. Nio will bounce back up pretty high.

Cosco call for run to earnings... I really can't think of a bearish case on this play right now. January exp, likely not risky or fast enough for you.

this company is already ubiquitous, now comes the public relations campaign, which will be a non campaign that will actually work.

Theil and the entire company have every incentive to produce results materially and in stock price because that's how they get paid. Only 20% of shares are available until the lockout period ends in march, 180 days from direct listing.  I'm often wrong

Exactly.  A lot of folks hating Citron today, but damn I think they laid out some decent points.  Selling 5k cars a month, and worth more than a company selling  a million a month.  Really?!?!  And it's not like they were shitting on $NIO long term, just saying they are too hot too quick.  Even at the $25 price target they laid out, that is still >10X ytd.

Position?
I'm in at 14 right now and intend to prob sell what I have start of next week. Buy in again when this shit drops and don't really care if it's 4-12 dollars but somewhere in there seems beyond reasonable almost likely.

It's a pumper meme stock, MM's know this and it's been highly touted for a long time so I think ppl will get burned on this one. But I'm a data scientist myself, and understand hte utility of what they are building probably better than anybody on this degenerate sub. Data integration services are so far beyond military, gov, and there's nobody out there with really intelligent backend systems like what they are building that they will translate to consumer in some capacity whether directly or be the underlying system behind many consumer facing companies. Either way it's win-win.

Take it from me, they'll moon based on their fundamental value. When I don't know, prob not know, but they will.
You're really asking where would the money come from in this day and age lol? Same place all the other helicopter money comes from, thin air. And all new money for that matter.

In all likelihood it's just gonna help keep it insignificant since games would have to be ported onto an entirely different chip architecture (since the M1 is not going to be x86 compatible) adding to development costs.

Why not Zoidberg?
Agree with that. However the open interest on 12/18 HYG puts is cautionary. And the spike in VIX December futures contracts. Big boys are hedging against something happening.
OK here is my theory. Black death killed about 1/3rd of Europe's population. After the pandemic the living condition of medival europe improved, wages increased, more resources for less people. 

Now, I think we are following the same pattern. Covid deaths & hospitalization are at ATH = Market ATH  due to wealth from dying boomers going to yolo millennials.
I made the same mistake. Luckily I cashed out on Nio at the perfect time today so that's taken some of the sting away.
They also forgot the Mircon stock the MU $42 FD

Picked up 50 x NIO 0DTE $47 puts for 0.21/contract and sold them at 0.75.  I then proceeded to watch them moon all the way up to north of 6.00
perhaps it can be explained by long term expectations about the housing market being inflated.
I have a crazy dog, may need your services someday if your cross species capable.
It‚Äôs about the hype. Long term NIO has room to grow because of China‚Äôs rapidly growing middle class and the governments backing of EVs. Personally I don‚Äôt think this stock is worth more than 45-50 even long term but it‚Äôll pass that because of hype and fomo

You ever have a really good day playing the wrong side?

I've been out of NIO since low 30s. Resisted going in again until the drop today. The funny thing is I didn't find out about the Citron report until 1pm, but still managed to profit on the first two dips. Even bought again on the third dip, got some solid unrealized gains headed into the weekend.

When it comes to trading, being right about a company is not enough.  You need others to be wrong.  To maximize your profit, you need to know exactly when they are going to figure out that they're wrong.

"Hope" is a powerful thing.  Right now, there's $62B of hope holding the price where its at.  The price isn't going to come down until they realize it's not worth it.

I'm predicting that they will be delisted before 2025.  It's a Cayman Islands company operating within the PRC.  They're intentionally dodging US Law in the Cayman Island.  Since they're operating in the PRC (subsidiary), the SEC can't investigate anything.  By being in the Cayman Island, they are not paying their share of taxes to the PRC.  PRC is not going to let them operate in their country and fuck them on taxes at the same time.  Shareholders are definitely going to lose out - since they have absolutely no legal rights; no class action lawsuits, nobody to make sure they're not fraudulent.  They also have no plans to sell cars outside of PRC.  Not going to last - per their own statements in their prospectus.
Lol how are they targeting the researchers?

You know options expire, right?
sold at 1900 rip me
You gotta buy the long term puts.  Short terms print nicely, but you're really gambling that THIS is the time a particular stonk's gonna drop VERY VERY SOON.  From my experience (especially spy as of recently), that's not common.  But long term puts short term calls.  Play it safe while econ still going up (soemhow, lmfao)

Fearless prediction: EV is this bubble cycle's dotcom.   


Yes, EV is the real deal. Yes, just like the internet, everyone and every business will be own an EV (some holdouts tho, same people that still use landlines).   


But like dotcom in 2000, it'll take 10 to 20 years before the current valuations are justified and, eventually, exceeded.

Didn't Citron tank INO 6 months ago? I lost some flesh from that. Seems like they take an opposing position to a hot (but plausibly speculative) stock and  tank it with a bad rating. Any bears with foreknowledge would make a killing.
She nuzzles your neck, laughing. Red wine is your being and hers.

As she climbs atop you, you can‚Äôt help but think of the day‚Äôs climbing. SPY‚Äôs slow melt up mirrors the slow melt of your flesh, as you and she mingle, waxes joining to form one angry, rhythmic candle.

After an exhale, deep and angry as a dying star, she asks: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gotten into you?‚Äù

You smile as you flip her over, ‚ÄúI just feel like a winner.‚Äù Because you bought calls. And she calls out your name. And she calls, calls...calls.

Haha, I was using that description to play devil's advocate and say I don't believe in their hype.

But they're attached at the hip to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary's crooked ass owns the DNC so I won't be surprised if their path to the trough is greased.

But let's be honest, it's just marketing hype.  They're not doing anything that Esri hasn't already done, it's just a different target market.  And not one without its pre-existing entrenched pigs at the trough, either.  I don't suspect  Raytheon will simply go away and sulk because a gay tech bro from San Fran showed up.

Why would Pfizer's German vaccine partner BioNTech let them do that when it doesn't benefit them at all? Why wouldn't BioNTech announce it themselves then?
It probably will despite the fact that there should be no correlation at all

There is nowhere in the female pelvis that you can store high amounts of liquid aside from the bladder. It doesn't matter what you can find in it. There is no other organ producing large amounts of fluid.

And the science is literally that they scan the bladder before and after squirting, and find it empties. It's literally that simple and easy and they've done it

It's pullback after 10% every day for 2 weeks. It's normal and should be expected. Citrons idiot report was just the catalyst. If it didn't happen here it would've happened after earnings, or after NIO day. The longer it runs parabolic the bigger the pullback would've been.
That's what's I'm saying. It's so retarded, it's fucking brilliant

I made money on NIO earlier this year but out at 30 since it seems to me it is already hyped too much, never saw it can reach such high. And Also make some money on puts today, but all closed now. I will watch and wait all the turbulence settled and probably will back in if it is not too pricey (I think it is already more pricey than Tesla)
I'm in the 300-500k camp in California (depends on the year) and we live super comfortably but I wouldn't buy more than one Tesla a year.

I can't afford to be sick from trading.

I mean work.
Well there were lots of interesting questions asked but an interesting one I read was that with the WFH home it seems SHOP may start outsourcing labour to places outside Canada. This could have many implications, backlash from people, cheaper labour costs, etc.
We need a groupchat yo I got some real ones like you I talk to as well

Hope you're right. Bought shares at $47 today as it started dropping from $50, then it kept dropping to close at $40. Hopeful for the long term.

NIO calls
Travel nurse
That was a rollercoaster
But Nio has a cooler name tho
I will need to find a new entry point. I had 2 ev stocks trigger a stop loss today. Xpev and nio. I'm thinking to only rebuy nio and skip xpev since I jumped into li at 31 today. Thoughts?
Who wants to start an EV company with me ?
You shouldn‚Äôt do that. You sold for a reason, don‚Äôt buy back in bc you see an uptick in price. Just remember that there will always be another stock to ride up. Source: I used to do that and lost every time.

Thanks bro not all regards are mean.
I‚Äôm going to guess $52c NIO 11/27
I respect their autism but at least be bullish about it damn
11/27 355p here.  Basically all in.  Should have waited until we test out new ATH though....

That pump at close.....
That's not slightly concerning?

Well I deleted the DD so... yes but since you‚Äôre not a post reading scrub and read the daily discussion which is the move. Here. 

XPEV SHIPS 4K CARS PER MONTH

LI SHOPS 3K CARS PER MONTH

NIO SHIPS 5k CARS PER MONTH. 

XPEV MARKET CAP: 32b

LI MARKET CAP: 28b 

NIO MARKET CAP: 62b. 

IM UP 150% ON MY PUTS TODAY ON NIO LONG BEFORE CITRON POSTED SHIT. CITRON ONLY VALIDATED MY CONCERNS. THEY ARE UNJUSTIFIABLY OVER-VALUED. 

PUTS INTO EARNINGS. THEIR EARNINGS WILL MATCH XPEV‚Äôs AND THEY WILL SLICE IN MARKET CAP TO JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE XPEV. LETS CALL IT 35b. 

NIO $35 AFTER EARNINGS. 

11/20 NIO 45p, 11/20 NIO 39p, 11/20 NIO 35p (all up over 100% today‚Äî$20,000). 

Good luck. You‚Äôre welcome. This is the only free DD I‚Äôll ever give, and I‚Äôm only doing it because I want all you call holding retards to know I‚Äôm right, and you‚Äôre retarded.

So how many actually got burned chasing Nio..? I wonder if it made more people money than lose it here.. fomo was hard not to join
Curious why you think it‚Äôs done
All of them will moon. Fuck Citron, they manipulated the market for their own gain.

NIO 54c, LI 40c, XPEV 50c expiring 11/20. I'm in balls deep and I won't be losing any sleep this weekend. We'll be fine fellow autist
You can only laugh at people losing their shit over NIO being at $43. Feels like yesterday everyone was wondering if $17 would hold.
Don't forget about HSAs. It's another way to hide money from taxes and you can spend that money on anything as soon as you turn 65

Look at it like this. Is Tesla the only game? No. Does NIO and XPEV have a viable product? Yes. Was XPEV earnings quadruple that of expectations? Yes. Will this trend continue? Yes. Is the Chinese government pushing for more EVs? Yes.

If Tesla has a car with autopilot good enough to be a robotaxi before 2030 I'd be absolutely floored.

It is such a hard problem that you really need a nearly legit superhuman AI to do it right. Solving autonomous driving before AI is going to be hard because the whole reason humans can drive in so many multitudes of uncertain conditions is we *know* what we're doing. We're a conscious agent aware of what we're engaged in.

When you take away the consciousness and just try to base it on rules or patterns it inevitably shits the bed. I'm not suggesting a supervised autonomous car can't get *very good* but that last bit of fully removing the human driver is way way harder than all the work that came before it. In fact, it's probably the hardest complex problem humans have ever tried to solve.

Hopefully
It will likely drop, whether is to $10, $4 or even $15 and never look back is anyones guess. 

Purely based on this subs 88% bullish sentiment, MM knows there are many long term Call holders and unwavering shareholders who are confident as long as it does not drop below $9 again. The house will always want to win, so they very well would dump down to a very low amount, logically speaking, forcing us to give up hope and sell, and ensuring your Calls never make it. 

I'm really hoping I'm wrong, but it seems very logical and I'm always on inverse WSB - If you remember Sept 2 Calls, SNAP and even NIO today. Following WSB you would have lost your life savings.

The other problem I struggle with is you have to be right once in a while.
I bought Nio $45 Puts 12/04 when the stock price was $48 yesterday for $4.55. I knew yall were fucked when Nio opened at $54 and my puts were still worth $3.90. I hope there is a rebound, so many people people have Nio Shares with a cost basis of 50+. I watched at least 1 million shares get sold in AH.

P.S I sold at 8.00 because the China EV hype still scares me.

MACD crossovers are somewhat reliable when you pull the charts out.

The Sept dip and spike on the "blue line" makes me nervous as a short-term bear. Blue line intersecting the orange line on the way down is a bearish signal.

Looking at the recent rally, that dip could be pushed slightly higher if we get some vaccine bullshit Monday morning.
Lmao what?
Don't get ahead of yourselves--even if we all know we're fucked, if recovery is the play of the hour that's what you play
Totally agree... I feel like many of us are like family here. We all are wanting to make money. Some of the comments I have seen are downright sad laughing at those who lost money.
I‚Äôm worried about the insane IV. NIO will have to fucking crush it like XPEV to overcome the crush.

NIO will be fine and higher in long term. But expect more negative news coming in short term. They are struggling to compete with Tesla at pricing and heavily in debt. I will not surprise they will do an offering in short term. The bright side is Chinese government definitely will bail them out, since they will not just watch an US company dominate their market. They even mentioned in government documents, separating battery and vehicle is the direction (NIO's plan). Chinese stock is all about politic back in China.

Actually NIO,XPEV,LI they all has difficulty to compete with Tesla, the delivery number is because of the booming of the overall EV sales, Tesla is actually taking over more market shares in orders.
NIO puts will print üêª
Hey, my brothers. I hope you had a good week.  .

If you're down, sad, isolation is weighing on you, PTSD, etc be sure you tell someone this weekend. Don't struggle with that alone. 

If you don't feel you can tell anyone nearby, message me.  I'm happy to talk to you.  I care about you.
Zero.... My trailing loss triggered. I'll watch it next week for an entry point but I suspect it will drop further first... Not sure... I'll read up this weekend.... You?
Death traps. And with all the shit drivers out there.

Yo who else had NIO 100c 11/13?

You think we have a lot of Chinese people on wsb lol?
It‚Äôs still close to a $10,000 gain. I‚Äôll take it.

We‚Äôre all fucking guppies man. Algos going from growth to value back to growth back to value all this week.

I honestly think they figured out how to push us out.
Lol do you know what a wash trade is and what it means for your taxes
Damn, this thing could be a bell ringer especially for how cheap you got the 69‚Äôs for, nice I hope this thing continues to be a cash machine
Puts were EASY money from beginning of March to about the 20th. Then if I had gone balls deep in calls, I'd be a millionaire right now.
You deleted your NIO DD? Why?
Oh sorry was including their own citizens, especially many in their rural areas, plus concentration camps. I've played with BABA, getting into NIO, but it makes me feel a bit icky.
To think that this all began when they shot a guerilla back on May 28th, 2016
Imma be honest, I thought NIO was just another meme, like NKLA. After hearing about all this Citron bullshit I think I'm even more bullish on NIO. Could it be reverse psychology to get it to pump more? Idk but it's going to rocket next week. Fuck Citron, all my niggas hate Citron
6 7/11 pizza slices worth
Yeah I'm in at 21, adjusted cost basis is around 16. Am I sad to "lose" a couple thousand today? Yeah, but I'm still up bigly on this position so overall I'm gonna just hold.
Not to mention they said the same about Tesla, had to retract and say they were going long and recently have said yet again that Tesla is too expensive. Prick

Damn nice . I hope to have gains like that some day
If you have puts you'd thank him already
We drink together on this night
Truthfully you can buy trendies for $10 each from people.
Fucking quality
Bought some puts so headed over to r/coronavirus to confirm my bias. Where else can I read bearish news?

Don't worry, I still have a shit ton of calls and leaps.
Glad the sentiment is bullish. Makes me feel good about my puts

These are the same retards who only just heard about citron today
Yeah I'm not doing anything serious, just playing around with a grand for weeklies and long term
The bear case for everything is pretty clear.

But if you don't think we're going to 3700-3800 before a major correction, you're gonna lose money chasing COVID cases.

NIO with the aftermarket fade. I feel like the earnings will be a negative catalyst, cause even with great growth numbers (in a good case), they still make people look more closely at the numbers and I feel like that's a bad thing for them right now.
This makes me feel like I need to take testosterone. This makes my balls look like raisins.
These Citron analysts--they're manipulators, they're liars, they're crooks...and some of them, I assume, are good people.
It means they are getting to production and not end up like Nikola. Fisker already has an operating vehicle.

I'm 100% convinced Citron was short NIO last week and when they saw it getting closer to ER they hat to pull 1 last hoorah to break even on their short

Citron also tried shorting NVDA on multiple occasions.
It was pretty range bound today. Made a killing selling 3 cent swings. 190 trades today, trading a few thousand shares back and forth.

Must be nice stealing tendies from the good people of WSB
Just my luck
Medium term calls. Unfortunately the market has yet to acknowledge Rockets value, so no weeklies. I have December, but honestly January is the better, safer play. I genuinely see it at $35-$40 EOY.
Probably a personal project. Same thing I'm working on for my own data analysis. All hail BDFL.

WSB is now a technical indicator
I don't know that's really comparible. The reason a company profits is not the same reason it receives investors. If a company is making huge profit every year but at a stagnant rate, that stock isn't going to receive as many investors YoY because it isn't growing. When investors see momentum in growth they want to invest, so they can grow their money (growth stocks). Certainly visibility is a catalyst, and is the main reason for a stock's overvaluation, but it is not THE reason people invest in a company. And if you're not considering growth when you're investing, then you might want to look into bonds.

It's actually pretty easy to start one. We can call it FOMO, we'll hold stocks based off of positive volume and robinhood  investor recommendations.
Judging by his profile picture and name checks out. Hes a mayor, can also be pinpointed quite quick by the necklace. His position is outside Wendys in Atlanta. (University Ave) He also recently spent time in Urrbrae, Australia, judging from the sap stain of the dragon's blood tree on the outer fabric of his left sleeve. Now one might think that this could be from the Canary Islands, but you cannot travel to the islands from the US currently. On a retired mayor salary, one cannot afford a large two stay trip like that. However we know the waite arboretum has the trees. This, combined with the witchetty grub residue on the inside of his left sleeve leads me to be fairly confident in saying he stayed there within the past 2.5 months. This also shows he is left handed, and has very early stage mild ataxia.
Sounds boring af. But different strokes for different folks i guess
So it begins...
Lol people are retarded to listen to citron. The same people that shorted shopify and said it wouldn‚Äôt go above $200. Now its $1000

Where‚Äôs the uncertainty? I figured that was the case for the first earnings (plus it was pre-released). But whats the uncertainty now? At the very least, the stock should‚Äôve moved on the announcement of a buyback.

We need like a super sleeper quaternary big brian deep dive company that‚Äôs about to moon so fucking hard with decent liquidity, low premiums, high delta, low theta, charismatic leader at the helm that will maximize our tendie rain 

Is that so much to ask
Big tech about to be making their way up next week. They've been the laggards last few months actually.
lmao - we're gonna be way over 180,000 new cases today, and recovery stocks are mooning.
A huge short selling company went after NIO today which is why it took the dive
Fucking Citron shorts Nio then releases a hit piece on the price target how is this legal
Is it Monday yet? I got some cash to hemorrhage.
Exactly. Nio cars awesome + autonomous driving capabilities + subscription battery service + backed by Chinese gov...don‚Äôt panic retards this ones a winner
how long till herd immunity with these 170k cases per day

Good luck man, use profits to build up a long term
Wwe 11/20 $60C
Normally they share bad news on Friday at close. I'm thinking that the vaccine pump isn't as bullish as it could have been. Monday BLOOD RED or $ROPE.
could go up could go down
Dude that's so shit. What state?
I‚Äôm fucking with you üòÇüòÇüòÇ
NIO calls
If wsb pumps the market cap enough their gay rules don't apply.
Still bullish on Musk.
Interesting, I'll look to go in Tuesday or Wednesday
Buy LEAPS, then theta doesn‚Äôt matter
Atta boy, pump it
Decay on weekends is minimal.

Ha. 5his really doesn't explain 85% of the rest of the market that's mooning. Same problem as RKT. Fucking bread lines.
I‚Äôm really not. I got to average down quite a bit I‚Äôll be printing next week guaranteed. Just not as much as I would‚Äôve like to haha
Apparently at the 2 month mark, given the number of enrollees in their clinical trial, if the vaccine hits certain performance benchmarks it will be deemed a success.  

The 2 month mark is sometime next week.  The Moderna vaccine is a similar type (mRNA) and targets a similar CoVid protein as the PFE vaccine.
Yes

Are you playing calls next week? I think it might go up to 470 by Wed

You can say that any over-valied company is up "too much". With earnings hype, this can only go up. This is an amazing short term play
Your daddy
Rona clearly bullish. If we hit 500k cases / day SPY gonna limit up.
It‚Äôs all interpretation. I see a taint with an asshole forming.
This is the correction. Markets were way too low.
I take it you‚Äôve read a couple?
I hope Citron gets fuckedd hard with Nio short. Scumbags!
Peeked at the Hopkins rona map and found it weird that GA is the only state showing "green" (declining virus spread, not their RH pf).

Shit popped from 1500/day, to 6300, and back down to 2300 within a couple weeks.

Either 2300 is the new support level, or this shit is rigged even more than the S&P American retirement fund.
Copy pasta? Fuckin Guido

I'm not even going to even bother even watching the video, market manipulation, they are creating the dip and buying it, it's not that hard to comprehend

Predictions on zm  for Monday?
And September 3rd was really bad
It‚Äôs this company that specializes in sending retards to the moon
Does optionsprofitcalculator.com not account for weekends or does theta actually fuck you on Saturday and Sunday?
Have you actually looked NIO cars? They‚Äôre fire
I stand corrected: your ignorant, rude responses and baseless comments on how you think you‚Äôre rich are the most cringey.
So many ways to say that rather than sow doubt. I think most educated people have known for a while that rapid tests are not reliable at per person level but are just used to get population level data.

The nasal swab one that hurts and takes a few days is the only true test. Yeah it's not instantaneous but it's the best we've got. Can't argue with reality.
I have done no research to support my position. Lol!

But the last time I rationalized my positions I lost 30k on $TSLA

And the last time I didn't rationalize my position I made 50k on $NIO

Obviously less brain power = greater tendie production.
did you account for the whores and tendies?

Wtf Europoor, US retard doesnt know what he talks about. US is just broke and does not got money to spent on public transport. Better stuck in rush hour 2h a day, terrible air and no way for the poor to get around, a real achievement. Still worse roads than in the EU.

Also some European countries make US look like a third world country (regarding infrastructure and policies) and these got the best public transport.
SOLO has zero chance of making a run similar to NIO. NIO is done as well

My suggestion would be to take a break for a lil bit
Yes sir, filling gaps from Monday 364 open on decent volume.
Fuck I wish I doubled down on NIO I can just feel it‚Äôll reach 60 on the run up to earnings now before correcting again I‚Äôve lost a load of money for nothing

So I‚Äôm a fan. I have calls for Monday for another overhyped vaccine weekend pump. You are right. I will be joining you Wednesday.
Is SOLO the next Nio?
Ever since I invested in RKT I can't stop thinking about it. I am their biggest fan. I never want those 3 glorious letters to leave my sight. I wrote RKT on the ceiling above my bed. I wrote RKT on the inside of my eyelids. I am in love with Jay Farner
Low
Makes sense. Thanks.
I am bull nio and has sold covered call. The problem with nio share price is not that it is overvalued tomorrow. It is overvalued today.

Chinese markets will allow it to grow, but share price is far detach from technical. U should at least expect it to visit 20D moving average every now and then.
Yeah I don't see why it wouldn't run up, xpev had a nice run up and both companies have already released their delivery results so seems like earnings should go well
Accepted into college for business so take it from an insider, NIO opening high Monday
This is exactly how your parents feel about you and how you will end up feeling about your children down the road
Thanks I kinda lost all motivation now tbh
Someone give me some retarded plays please
Maybe you can afford a phone plan now
Will I get theta fuxked on my nio 60c weekly or IV can still save me to get out during the morning pump?
Why is SQ so poopoo
Seems highly unlikely. Might make a couple hundred grand tho. Now if you were buying leap options you might have a shot. I‚Äôm thinking of the doing the same but haven‚Äôt grown a full set of balls yet.

Earnings has historically been good but had a sell off with NIO bro, so idk really, because XPENG and Li reacted very well to their earnings prior to this whole bullshit today with the loser short seller who's wrong 99% of the time. So it's really 50/50 on what happens, there won't be many surprises in the report (maybe improving vehicle margins and some Md&a interesting outlooks). But it's anyone's guess what happens regardless of the performance, if your risk adverse wait till after , if your willing to go balls deep buy before but I only own shares personally, the risk with options on this stock is nutty.
>Like my dude just admit you bought puts and want that stock to get dunked but quit pretending people won't connect your user name to <username.wordpress> as nonsense you just made up

I literally have no idea what you're talking about you sound like a schizo lol.

I'm a nio long btw.. heres one of a few of my long calls

I‚Äôm hi daddy ü§© where you taking me out tonight to celebrate?
So many meme stocks have been born since March that it's hard to know how they're going to behave going into another pandemic spike. More meme traders back at home? 

Maybe. Some of the more durable meme names have hit what seems to be a pretty durable air pocket. Tesla is 90 points off its August high. GME well under its high.

Will there be a constant rotation where old meme stocks are forgotten forever? Or will there be "sector rotation" back into old meme stocks. Tough to say.

It's the weekend bro.
Controversial. What brings you to this conclusion? It's not Nikola or Theranos. A legit product in an early market. Mix that with the Chinese love to buy their own product + their fast and loose commitment to the smog - they believe their mass manufacturing of solar panels and going green will reverse their current climate impact and are using the coal revenue to finance it. As a few year prospect surely?

Even if there‚Äôs a sell off Monday from underwhelming news it‚Äôll be another good opportunity to load for the long term.
I used to go out 4-5 nights a week. Now I just sit at home doing nothing
lost $400 with my call options :/ looking at the option activity, looks very bullish next week. 

My opinion is big banks gonna be analyzing DKNG Q3 over the weekend and I expect an increase on price target next week

Im seriously thinking about it. Any suggestions?
48 is definitely a pivot point. See my post about it earlier today. That said, people are going to be spooked going into earnings Tuesday especially after the Citron hit piece.

Dictator is the key word there. They can force quarantine and shut down travel with full control. 

Also, our US companies which hold factories overseas report their employees sick rates more accurately than the govt would. By using statistics a big enough sample size should represent the country big picture.

Three warnings I believe, the fourth being the one that flagged me for day trading. Any additional day trades after that while below 25k in account value brings down the sanction hammer on your account. I‚Äôm in the process of having the restrictions removed.

Yep. You have huge balls if you put 10k on that but would have paid off

I think it touches 60 no matter what. Everyone that wanted out at 50+ got out today and then started buying back in at 40.

This Friday was just a repeat of the last two Fridays. The same swings, just with a lot more volume.

Is SOLO about to go buck wild? Cautious of buying at the top but also cannot dispute retard strength shown by all NIO imitators lately.
Took me about 30 seconds of rereading it to realise it didn't have an e.

I read the article briefly and then looked at all the analyst information, seems to still be a steady stock. Will probably be all time high again by Tuesday.
I‚Äôd say that seems highly unlikely,...but also true
NIO makes awesome cars and is backed by the Chinese gov....you think they‚Äôre going to let it fail?

Sometimes things are more simple than they seem

No, the wave is puts since it was at $54. It went from $54-40 in one day and you think you‚Äôre smart telling everyone to buy puts? You do realize that they have CHINA‚Äôs backing? Think Huawei but with evs. Good luck.

Your a gentleman and a scholar, thanks again!
They buy and sell every other day no biggy
Even better
Let's say stock is at 100. You sell 110 call for 50 dollars. Stock plunges to 80. Your shares lost 2000 in value but you got back 50 so your net is - 1950.

But if you have 10k in cash and sell a 90 put for 50 then you get assigned at 90 and your net is - 1000 + 50 = - 950. ( because you bought 100 shares at 90 while they are at 80 you are 1k in the red)

I would just google ‚Äúbiggest pre market movers‚Äù in the morning and at open wait 15min for _____ to start mooning and yolo it all in, as soon as it slowed or passed 30% I would sell. Then on Monday after SPY 4% gap I threw 13k into spy otm calls and then fucking RH went down and an easy 10% gain turned into 2k the next morning :( anybody else been screwed by RH

So one more funny point about this show airplane. Ten minutes in I saw two groups of people have a problem with southwest and the agents said we will give you a travel voucher to make up for it.

Compare that with airlines today. It's like dude we got you there didn't we? Be grateful we don't charge you $20 for a diet Dr pepper.

I got burned with trying out options back in August/September so I decided not to mess around with it anymore. 20-25 would be a perfectly acceptable turn of events 1 year from now for me, nearly doubling my average cost per share (13.74). It‚Äôs basically a sit and don‚Äôt look at play for me over the next year no matter what.
So you‚Äôre trying to ride the wave? Are you going to be telling everyone to buy calls on Monday? Find another stock to talk about instead of one everyone in this sub has traded at one point in the last 12 months.
I‚Äôll Venmo you $25 if so.
Shit man, sorry to see. Get them on the phone, asap. If you cannot, you'll find out Saturday morning how they handled it.

Option houses need exercise instructions by 5:30pm, and I'm not sure how TDA handles this by default since I specifically instructed them to DNE (do not exercise). I am inclined to believe they would exercise your ITM calls by default though.

\*If\* you end up short 600 at 3105, you may get really lucky and be able to buy to cover underneath. Pre market trading starts at 4:00am...

Bro why, even if you are bullish and fomoing, it‚Äôs bound to pull back b4 keep going. (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll keep going, i bought in at the dip today, gonna sell my calls eod Monday and keep the shares for earning)
I honestly think the traffic has gotten worse than pre covid. It may be due to the fact that people no longer want to take public transportation which makes sense
You cant get IV crushed unless you hold through earnings. And puts are retarded considering it already sold off

Bro don‚Äôt be so negative. You never know what life will bring what you will learn or who you may meet who could change your entire existence. Be smart about what you do always try to better yourself and learn about somthing your passionate in and become the best in that industry. With some careful money management and strong will power and keeping spending to a minimum you may be able to drastically change things. Never give up hope and always try to elevate yourself. Don‚Äôt count on a yolo to change your life instead try to change it with lots of little changes that amount to a massive change. If you look at one step of a ladder it‚Äôs tiny. If you jumped off the first stef you would be fine now imagine 9 more little steps up and all of a sudden your in a very different place !!!

Profitable week. 39.21% so far on the fun account. 12.74% on the retirement account. No whammies, please!
Depends on how excited we are about the possibility of gains/losses.
Yep, wiped out my 0DTE calls; should have booked a profit when they were up at open rather than being greedy and hoping it would do what TSLA did on a Friday a few months back.
I prefer it maximized personally
with Li earnings being less than stellar and bidens new support for american EV, i dont see nio going on another moon mission like it has been the last week.

Bro, this is November
deadass.
Difference between daily and weekend threads
I mean. Neither really. It was a correction that was due. Just premature and overextended because of the article. I mean the high growth comes with high volatility and turns the sector into both a bear and bull trap. It‚Äôs a seasoned traders wet dream though. In the long term it‚Äôs for sure a bear trap. They will lose everything if they go full bear on this sector.
im honestly thinking so. 500-600 by christmas is my guess.
They always shatter their earnings expectations you'll be fine. That date actually got moved up to Monday pre market so potentially a good sign?
I'm happy after today I didnt get back into NIO, I would have gotten greedy with those $49s and lost it all after today's dump. Imma play FSR tbh, I think North American EVs have a lot of room to run and people are starting to realize that there are other EV options in North America that isnt bloated TSLA or crazy ass NKLA. I dont want anything to do with any chinese stocks as the Mango seems hellbent on escalating a trade war before he leaves.
That would make since if it didn't make him wealthier in the process.
I'm reading the comments and realizing a bunch of you fucktards don't actually realize this is a satire account. I'm proud of y'all.

Why do we sometimes maximize shitpost and other times minimize it
Pure luck
You should have bought options then you would have had a realistic chance
Sold my NIO calls at open, FOMOed back in like 30 minutes later, and got left holding the bag. Now my gains are gone and my calls are down 50% with an exp date of 11/20. I'm holding out hope for a recovery on Monday and/or Tuesday... But basically I'm pretty fucked, right?
Could you imagine buying a 0dte 45p on NIO today at the top for .01 and cashing at the bottom for 4.50? Insanity.
Can someone explain what I‚Äôm looking at
I would hold....
They bribed some of the tesla designers I think.
And you should've switched back to calls?
Tobacco companies are getting nervous with a new player in the customer killing business.
There is the very little possibility it might be the next big Microsoft or Adobe. Especially since they are big, but niche in their data analytics, and mostly B2B. If they their software and data can trickle to everyday consumers like us, and become a big name rest assured they will be $100 very soon. Then again, they managed to break away from only having government clients to having commercial clients, once they scale to everyday people, I will shoot to Alpha Centauri. 

That being said, this sub is too bullish on this stock for MM to pump enough money to raise it that high. Especially with so many people holding long calls. Likely estimate 20 to 25 in 1 year time assuming no March 2020 2.0 (and that is coming from someone who owns more PLTR share than you). 

Thus always inverse WSB, get puts, make yall bulls and hopefuls wannabe panic sell when it drops to $7, then moon once yall learn your lesson.

sure, why not?
Never hold through earnings
Lol do you think you‚Äôre some kind of prophet? I will check back on this comment after earnings. One of us will be right.
ban snowflakes please
No
got a PRPL mattress bout a month ago. It's comfy
God I‚Äôd say it‚Äôd go even lower than 35. If NIO ever breaks convincingly under 40 I think nearest support is in the high 20‚Äôs. AH immediately after earnings I could see 35 though. But the rest of week I‚Äôd give at least 3 red days if they don‚Äôt impress or issue out more stock. But so far even if it goes down the call holders still made more on the way up, easily.
AMC up on Mango man vaccine pump.  Yeah that will have legs /s

Let me introduce you to AYRO

Fuckers cost me 1.8k I had to get away from my phone for 10 minutes and lost it all. I was up 1.7k in like 5 minutes.
If VIX drops below 20 rotate to put weeklies
That‚Äôs a winning ticket he will cash that one
Right now is a good entry. Rocket‚Äôs still almost at IPO price despite two straight good earnings calls.
If I had seen that article earlier I would‚Äôve bought as much of the dip as I could
What‚Äôs Andrews home address
If you buy at the top, you get niod
I think you're supposed to run the wheel on stocks you expect to trade within a range, not things that can blow up
What‚Äôs with UUP? SPY gonna be 365 come Monday.
why would you allow your son to invest your money
Went all in on SPY puts buts realize how stupid that is knowing that a vaccine is around the corner to take the market back to normal.

If the market truly is "forward thinking" then a moon mission only makes sense.
Calls or puts on NIO?
No doubt no doubt. As long as you start with money you can afford to lose it‚Äôs fun af. These dumb asses coming in here trying to afford a house/car/PS5. Fools! Never take it out.
I thought I was SUPPOSED to lose money, you aren‚Äôt a trader till you are in red ;)

Even with like 1/100th of that in my portfolio my portfolio still commonly fluctuates by 10% over a 12-month period. It's dumb if you do it more than a couple times a year, or if you keep doing it and it mostly goes down.
STONKS ALWAYS GO UP!
I know hahaha just messing around
this sub is starting to sound like stockwit autists
Don't let them talk shit to you. P/E ration doesn't matter in a zero interest rate environment for the following years. It's all about growth. 

And if you're a smart ass autist: price to EBITDA has way more value as metric. Do your homework, nerd.
Same two days ago
NIO puts
probably a good entry point was the mini dump at close. The MM fuckers did not let things drop enough for good entry on calls. I picked up some 11/16 360c for 0.77, they were as high as 1.30 and closed at 0.89 for perspective. Also got rid of my 11/20 350p hedges after that massive run up and close, that‚Äôs just way too bullish of a close, hit my target of 358
When did you buy though?
Most likely Mississippi. Closest thing to Kazakhstan. Wawawewa. Very nice!
Can we expect a little pump Monday morning ? So we can get out !?
Not my first time...And your wording makes you sound like a salty gay bear boomer lol. I don‚Äôt even have nio options. Im just saying, it could‚Äôve kept running til earnings besides profit taking here and there, ten big banks upgrade its price targets but some guy says ‚Äúthe price is too high‚Äù and it tanks? Also, from what I‚Äôve read today, his history with doing this is kinda sketchy. Idk how people constantly bring up price fundamentals in this market like they have mattered. I will check back on your comment after earnings lol. One of us will be right.
My uncle runs this place in D.C. that sells yellow hair dye and face bronzer and he says it's going bankrupt because his biggest, fattest customer stopped buying that stuff.
Just play NIO calls and sell before earning gs. I will VENMO you money if we dont see a solid runup against
Tesla also haz tequila. Nio has....?
same. ended up buying back in the same amount i sold it for when i saw NIO was making its way back up just to have it go down again after i bought itü•¥

If it dips more on monday I shall. those premiums are getting expensive
Meanwhile hospitals in Italy or something are already over run again.
EPR, ARI, ACRE & MFA..Maybe DIS , open to discretion
Oh god. I ain‚Äôt god of Monday homie. I can‚Äôt tell you what it‚Äôs gonna do monday. I‚Äôm the god of Tuesday earnings day. And that‚Äôs the day it goes to 35. 

You want a baseless prediction? Flat with maybe some growth Monday. Scare off the paper hand bears. Maybe even a run up Tuesday? Earnings hits and it chops 20% after hours to 35. 

Here‚Äôs the catch. Post earnings IV is dead. So even if you‚Äôre a smart bear, if you‚Äôre not ITM, you‚Äôre dead. That‚Äôs why I mainly hold 45p‚Äôs instead of 35p‚Äôs.
Nice. I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter, whatever you do, you lose money ü•∫
Yeah they are looking good! Maybe I‚Äôll look for a good entry
Any üåà üêª planning to buy a Citron with those puts?
March 2021, I‚Äôm sittin comfy this weekend.
so nio earnings is our last chance to salvage tendies before it dies ya? what‚Äôs the next meme stock then
Possibly
Yeah honestly wait for a real pull back you are too late, nio and ev has been pumping for months if you didn't go in before and now you want to you just have fomo and are chasing. Buy it now if you are gonna hold it for a year and can stand seeing it down 40% for a few months
what about the non-native Chinese?
IM NOT WALKING OUT ON NIO, BOUGHT MORE CALLS TODAY! WOOOO F ANALYST ANALYSIS.. IF THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THEY WOULDNT BE WORKING ANYMORE CUZ THEY WULD HAVE GONE ALL IN ON $2
Yeh this. If you believe it PLTR
Pltr is already 25 billy large, so to 10x it would need to be able to justify 250 billion market cap.

I dont think that happens in a few months, but stranger things have happened so who the fuck knows.

Of course no one knows wtf will happen but I wish you luck either way

Instead of running the wheel, why not just buy the shares and just sell covered calls? If you start by selling cash secured puts hoping to get assigned, don't you have massive downside exposure if the stock takes a huge shit below the put's strike price?

Only made 300-400% ROI shorting the ccp wheels selling for half their high (including a few at near cost early on in day) but im very glad I sold when I did. Yuck. I didnt know its stock was ccp x cancer. Never trading that company again. Im out.

Used the proceeds to buy the odd dips in 5g semis. VeeZee is going to spend up to 20bn in the upcoming c band auction. Hope you guys are ready for its implications.

I don't know buddy, that doesn't sound like a free trip to me.
you're not fucked but this can be ptretty bad. worst case scenario you get hit with thousands in interest fees. or stock moves in between your stikes after hours on the spread leaving you unhedged. or stock moves against your shorts come monday and you're on the hook for interst fees + difference in strikes. youll just have to wait the longest weekend of your life to see what happens on monday. get them  on the phone asap premarket if you can
Right now they are posted every trading day on /r/RedditTickers.
You understood that right! Top up while you can.
Well good luck to us both, I‚Äôm in on PLTR as well...I think it‚Äôll do good long term, just depends how good

CASHAPP! What a place to start, a terrible place to try to roll over into a real brokerage
Yep 100% agreed. Don't expect it to go crazy like NIO or SOLO but the Google buyout is a done deal at 7.35 a share. It's steadily been going up and once europe finalizes the approvals it will pop on the news. This is a buy the rumor sell the news play I'm just throwing out there.
Don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs a plague out there
Lol, never thought of that
Bruh. I sold before buying calls at the top. Not kidding. Thought we‚Äôd be have a second day of run up and then sell off in the afternoon like every Friday. Nope citron had other plans. Luckily I had more funds to buy the dip lol but my puts woulda been up nearly a 1k%. Trust me I‚Äôm kicking myself. Hard. But shit happens ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Actually I just noticed these are debit spreads. Normally, TDA closes these for you as you cant exercise the calls you bought.. 

just a heads up, you may have to take the full hit as youre obligated to call them after hrs or during close to close your spreads since you dont have the capital to do it yourself.

TDA might cut you some slack but idk bro they can say you fucked up
Well done. Keep it up.

How do you know that? Sounds like an imaginary scenario you made up in your head. Also on your remark about ‚Äúgrowing balls and do something to make money‚Äù... the best way to get rich is to get into a job that gives you a high income and then use that money to invest into ETFs and maybe a small amount into penny stocks/options. Gambling all your capital on penny stocks or options is not ‚Äúballsy‚Äù it‚Äôs fucking stupid.
Yes

I put my entire portfolio into PLTR shares. I own 4300 shares of Palantir and nothing else. I‚Äôm unemployed in California making the max amount and I plan on being off the grid backpacking the PCT starting in March until September. Is there any chance that I come out of that hike a millionaire? Maybe a half millionaire? Assuming you believe in Palantir over the next year could they hit 100 bucks per share by then?

That‚Äôs my play for now. I‚Äôve got like 15k (for gear and day to day backpacking expenses) in cash and I‚Äôm living rent free at my parents house after ending my apartment lease and throwing away/selling all my shit. I feel like this is as smart of a semi realistic lotto ticket plan for millionairehood tendies as you could hopefully get.

Edit: my average cost per share is 13.74 so not too bad there.

I was looking very seriously at buying in at 18. Breaks my fucking heart that I didn't.

Ultimately I didn't pull the trigger because these guys just rebrand other people's stuff. They don't actually make their own ram or anything.

Falls to 35 after earnings release Tuesday*. Sorry. Unclear. Good point.

I will never chase a fucking 50% gain. I only go short for the 100%+. And I only do it when there‚Äôs so much writing on the walls it feels like you‚Äôre in a saw movie.
zombie SPAC right now. Long term you might be good but don‚Äôt expect anything soon. Probably going to be some  very high selling pressure between $13 and $18 with all the bagholders wanting out
First time with pumps and dumps ? Someone will always open their mouths, when stock is running on pure hype its easy to take it down.

At least they are doing something smarter rather than buying a meme company at ATH and acting like ''this is a long term investment'' when talking about a fucking Chinese company that no native Chinese has ever heard about.

Yeah my bad, only up 50% on the ones I bought today, not 150% sorry, what makes you think it's going to drop so much before earnings? Wouldn't it run up and drop after if anything?
half the news is about corona cases going up and the other half is about vaccine, so what's the move
QE baby
This is the only flaw, but it won‚Äôt happen fast enough before earnings.

Its not a renewable resource for everyone
This fucking guy just came to take a dump on you call holders. I love it.
this is why spreads are a level 4 strategy. people dont understand the responsibilities for closing them. you always buy/sell back the spreads because of pin/assignment risk. someties you have to buy them back for MORE tha the width of the spread from liquidity issues. stick to spx with spreads
Canada is freaking out and thinking of canceling Christmas because they have 4k cases per day. We have 150k cases per day and don't even give a shit.

If they‚Äôre both expiring ITM, you should be taking your full collateral - credit given for opening the spreads and it should show by midnight or Monday. I spoke to TDA about this situation before and you have the obligation to keep an eye on your options stretching to the after hours on the DTE. If you didn‚Äôt choose to exercise then, then TDA will do it for you.

You can never lose more than your collateral UNLESS only your sold put expires ITM in the after hours. In that case, you have to resolve the issue with your brokerage.

You should file a complaint though. If TDA finds your spread to be at risk of assignment, and your account is too small to take the assignment, they should close it for you. I‚Äôm unsure of when they have to close it for you, but their risk mitigation is a lot more loose than Robinhood as TDA is a bit more suited towards professionals/ knowledgeable traders

A)  Don't trade vertical spreads if you are going to freak out when this possibility happens. Take risks into consideration.  
That's it.
That‚Äôs why it needs to go down more lol
fuck CNN
It is trash for sure
Stocks don't always go up. You may be forced to sell after a big drop to raise tax money. This happened to many people in the past.

For this reason, try to move as much as possible into IRA/401k accounts. Try to buy and hold for long term in taxable account.

Idk why people say just money. You spend all day trading and on this sub. It‚Äôs not just money. It‚Äôs your time invested. How about when you make money? Should you not celebrate? Bc just money? Not feeling your losses bc ‚Äújust money‚Äù and celebrating gains majorly is how you go fucking broke.

You are terrible at interpretation, must be those genes.

Better genes means more likely to live a long, healthy, fulfilling life and reproduce successfully. The sherpas have adapted to their way of life, so absolutely their genes are better than mine for their way of life. Danny devitos personality is better than mine. That's a combination of his genes and experience. The rocks physical traits are better than mine, that's his genes and his work ethic... And some steroids tbh. But I have a couple tricks up my sleeve too. I bet I can play more instruments and better than both of them. I have that natural aptitude, partly to my genes and my development.

If you can't clearly see that different people have differing levels of natural aptitude, and it affects them in differing ways, I don't know what to tell you.

I am completely fucked, check my post history. Any advice is appreciated right now.
Agreed. I‚Äôm very bullish on PLTR. I think it‚Äôll grow steadily over the next few weeks and with any luck pick up mainstream and meme hard then I can cash out in 2-3 months.
Skip lunch and buy one more PLTR share.
If you only buy two shares then you‚Äôll be mad when it goes down and even more mad when it goes up.
Nah, no trust fund, just won the startup equity lottery.

i posted before: ‚ÄûBMW is selling 2500k cars and the market cap is way less then Nio with 2k sales.‚Äú

And what I did was buying Nio calls.
Saw several comments in the daily about buying the Zoom dip cause new cases are skyrocketing and some places are considering restrictions again. As if all that matters when a valuation is so expensive is the now
Is the ER after market close?
Plantir gonna dump on Monday bruh, NIO is much better
Also, having a "net worth" of $30 Million does not mean you have a brokerage account with $30Million to invest.... 



However, "allow me to shit on my own point": The $30 Million figure is just the minimum "net worth" needed to be considered an "Ultra-High-Net-Worth" individual, so he could be worth $100Million+

reasonable price of CN¬•275,000 (about $41,000)."

After getting asspounded by SPY today (350p, 352.5p, and 357p various exp in December) I bought calls all afternoon.  Leaps in DKNG, OXY, COTY, UBER), weeklies in PTON and a GME $11p for 12/18 cause I can‚Äôt help myself.   Probably inverse all these if you like tendies.

NIO 45p 11/20, 39p 11/20, 35p 11/20, all up over 100%. Good luck brother on the other side. Check my comment history for DD on why you‚Äôre weong

The funniest part is I can guarantee you when NKLA does finally die it is going to take the other EV companies stock down for at least a couple days just because of association.

Congrats. You happened to buy at the 100% perfect opportune time (I mean, you‚Äôre obviously lying). But. Nice. Better sell those calls right at open before NIO falls to 35 Tuesday.

Actually dickwad the hoax he was referring to, and trust me I've watched the videos of this exact moment which clearly you haven't if you think differently, was the Democratic response to his handling of coronavirus. He was calling the criticism of it "their new hoax" harkening back to what he considered the Russia investigation (which don't even get me started on considering he's an unnamed co-conspirator in 3 cases within that investigation that would have landed him felony charges if not for a Nixon aide wayyy back in the day saying you can't indict a sitting president). So yes, he did not call the virus itself a hoax, he called criticism of his handling it a hoax. That does not detract from the fact that I've had no less than a dozen people in my life take to social media afterwords using that as "proof" that this whole thing is a hoax. That does not detract from the many times Trump has told his own followers to not trust the medical community on this issue. You dismissing me as being a leftist is hilarious because I'm the farthest thing from it, you just have no idea how to interpret your own cult leaders rhetoric. Rhetoric that I myself have watched lol. Bye.

It might as well gain 40%. Its not like it makes sense. The price movement today just confirmed how retarded the volatility is at the moment. No position in Nio either, but the hype affects other EV stocks, obvously.
Found the guy that plugged the orders in at $51.50. Everyone with calls can thank this guy for NIO not tanking harder. Imagine if you went full retard and bought calls instead. You‚Äôd be down -95%..

I work with Chinese clients all the time. They would all agree with this - buy at your own risk. US MM / Hedge Funds are rookie league compared to their Chinese counterparts. Imagine Trump having the power to ban the world's largest IPO because the CEO didn't respect him enough lol.
do not invoke those cursed words. Remember that week was the time where we collectively lost more than ever before banking on unemployment numbers being far higher than even big banks predicted vs. powell and brr.money
It was a total clickbait. In addition, NKLA-Hindenberg's lovemaking just helped Citron.

What did Cramer say about NIO now?
Holy shit. People are fucking stoooopid. No one told you to hold or sell.
Next week in a nutshell:

A) If schools remain open, Stonks go up.

B) If schools end up being locked up due to virus concerns, Stonks go down.

Kicker: Moderna/Azn release positive vaccine results before market open on Monday. In that event, whatever happens above... Stonks will still go UP!

I hope everybody had a good week. I noticed when I go to cash I have no fucking care what happens this weekend.

TSLA calls Monday.   Or puts.   Either way it's a nice boomer play.
Lol you do realize this pretty much applies to 99% of the stocks right now?! We're trading in a bubble.
no idea man
I predict Walmart earnings will beat on Tuesday and it will rocket. Ban if wrong.
TBH I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve been bag holding shares for a while now. Hoping for a Hyliion like pop to $50ish, but no way of knowing if that‚Äôll happen.
Definitely not here
Because of autists like us, itll moon to 50 again Monday on the run up to earnings, just watch...

And then it'll dump our asses on tuesday and we'll all have to live on the streets out of cardboard boxes :D
Stats, how do they work?
Everything you said is correct except your TLDR
I loved selling that 16 weekly call for 1.2, I still have my shares.  ü§†
absolutely wild 

Was that peak TSLA from Feb 4, July, Sept or another time? Are you monitoring all posts or just the daily?
What‚Äôs crazy is I guarantee no one on this sub would switch places with Warren Buffet.

Ah yes, blame the father. If life has taught me anything, you can be the best fucking parent in the world.. but your kid could end up as drug addict or murderer. The "kid" is 31 years old and he's old enough to make his own choices. Unfortunately he lost millions because of his stupid choice, the father did nothing wrong.
It was some of the first "bad news" since NIO has been skyrocketing. Except the bad news is "NIO stock price is too high imo".
We'll be at 3K deaths per day at some point this winter. And people will still think its a hoax and the market still might not crash without a liquidity crunch
The bulls being so confident making me feel better
i've been wrong on earnings plays for 3/4

i was told i had a 50% chance

i want my money back
I want to be angry at Citron, but really I‚Äôm angry at the morons that listen to them.
I thought Hindenburg's report on Nikola was actually pretty thorough. Also fuck China.
MAXR>SRAC
I'm pretty new to this, already figured out I shouldn't care about 95% of the things posted in this sub.
JD is at an all time high right now, after hours. And its valuation rose 38% since the last earnings report.

Are puts not obvious on this? I‚Äôm not exactly saying that the marketcap should decrease, but unless the company‚Äôs earnings grow 20%+ QoQ, seems unjustified, no?

To make things more interesting - the report will be premarket on Monday. Will make a play during the day on Mon or Tues depending on which way the earnings swing it

100c 12/18 or 85p 12/18
DoorDash, Airbnb, Roblox, Wish

Those investors don't care about citron and will just see a buy the dip opportunity, I think this also explains the rebound toward the end of today
I sold everything because covid fears are going to ramp up bigly this weekend.  If Trump's rally in DC on Saturday is big the media will cite it as a super spreader event and blame it on Trump.  On Monday I'm going to buy the dip on cyclical and recovery stocks.  And EVs.

The problem is lockdowns now are going to have much more devastating economic effects than last spring. There will be no stimulus to offset lost income and loan deferment is ending for many types of loans. But Democrats, always the true autocrats and economically illiterate, refuse to consider effects.

TLDR: This time it's different, BULLS R FUK! Buy TLT, sell all rips.
Never bet against USA
Interactive brokers. Can open an account with $2k. Then lose it in a day (or even a morning) you know that‚Äôs the way
Ya blew it, NIO gonna moon next week
Of course. I‚Äôm sad I sold out of my puts and getting fooled into thinking we were going up further into a late afternoon sell off. Dumped prematurely due to the citron article. But ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è shit happens. It‚Äôs not really a meme stock so I‚Äôm gonna print huge on calls next week. Puts will print too. That‚Äôs how these stocks work. Up huge, corrections, consolidations, repeat. Just enjoy the huge premiums while you can!
Bought $7.5 calls expiring 11/20 also puts 5.5 expiring same.

Hopefully it moves big in either direction
Depends on PM. ER is still Tues AH. The only thing I did today was sell the 44p11/13 for a small profit before noon. I held onto all of my leaps.


Citron's report wasn't about the short term profits, it was about letting MMs get in at a lower cost so they try to stay ahead of Tesla 2.0.
Low volume shit that doesn‚Äôt really matter. Especially so on a Friday
the short seller reports are always vague / gay like that. 

Every big runners get some short report luv. 

Im more concerned with the shit the ccp has been doin.

They mad mad at Ma.
Wow this reassures me that my spy puts are going to be fine thank you autist
From the tweet that says, two tests negative and two tests positive?? Sounds like a toss up to me.
The dip that will never come.  I've been trying to short this damn thing for the last two weeks, I don't think it's happening Ghey Ber Brother...
I bet it rises a bit then drops Tuesday rise Wednesday to steady rise, then Friday big jump then stabilize a bit lower.. idk I'm thinking ~$47 by next Friday.
We'll be hitting 200k daily covid cases and averaging1500 deaths by the start of next week. And easily 300k by the end of the month..... crazy.
>The truth is so apparent that no evidence is necessary. Faith is sufficient in the face of such bold faced heresy. Only the holy anointed priests may divine the will of the gods.

No, yeah, sure. You‚Äôre different.
Boomer stonks are fine
Perception: Citron caused china EVs to dump billions today

Reality: NIO weekly RSI 90+, WSB's entire 401ks in calls. This was always going to happen, if it wasn't Citron there would have been some other catalyst.
Don't you dare underestimate my retardation.
I mean bulls had 4 outta 5 days green. Bears had one. So I doubt it. Everyone will win if they time it right.

Depends on much you are consuming. ISPs provide burst acceleration of bandwidth, but if you use a large amount over time they can throttle that down - not to be very slow but not maintaining the burst bandwidth levels either. Rebooting the modem might be issuing a new IP address and resetting their counter if the way they track this is crude.

Or your modem might be shitty, but that seems unlikely.

what if i told you citron had really nothing to do with NIO dumping and everything to do with NIO being like 90 weekly RSI with WSB all-in calls.
Puts are a wager that share prices will go down by x date. 

Calls are the opposite. 

Now please: open robinhood and tell me what to do.

I was gonna do some street-level research on this company when I heard they were launching a storefront in Portland and when it came time to find out where it was going to be I called IR and they told me it was opening at a mall. So then I called the mall and asked about it and they said that they hadn't leased a space, they leased a KIOSK. 

So I sold all my shares at a gain same day.

Rise.
The candlesticks on the SPX and DJIA weekly charts are ridulous. Doji fucking stars at all time closing highs. 

We're either at the midpoint of a end of year mania rally (Nov lows thru today) or about to put in a significant, lasting high.

Seasonally a rally is most probable but  something doesn't feel right about this market
Wasting money on FD weeklies? Likely No. Buying 3 month or more expiry options and LEAPS on growth companies? Absolutely.
I wasn't even holding NIO, but these posts are stupid.  You didn't "know" shit, you got lucky and they got unlucky.

Gran Autismo - Clint Eastwood buys NIO calls.
I expect it to drop more as unsophisticated investors start to hear about this Citron news over the weekend - not everyone reads the news 24/7.... plus with earnings on Tuesday, even though the news will probably be good, historically, it drops a bit or goes flat for a few days before rebounding, if it does rebound.
That's too bad because my advice would be don't do what I did.
Sold mine today at a 250% gain. Not tempting fate again...

As a 29 year old who graduated with 30k debt for a four year bachelor degree, I hate the idea of student loan forgiveness. 

Worked my ass off to pay majority of them off the last 5 years, last thing I want to do is pay off other peoples loans now after all the sacrifices I made to be responsible and pay them

I guarantee you Elon musk is mad af at his past self for making their IP public.

Also fine you got me. I‚Äôll buy a leap tomorrow, are you happy
Check the 300/290 put vertical for December 18. So maybe between now and then
Elon has covid. My tesla shares :(
It's gonna shoot through the roof after earnings
funny thing. Me high af and drunk, bought some calls without even knowing what the fuck i was doing, made 500%. Sober I tried to do the same and lost all my profit and some more.
Lost in all the Chinese EV stuff, KCAC has been mooning to Valhalla. Kicking myself for only holding shares and not calls.

I did a stupid today not gonna lie, but 5k swing today is temporary. It‚Äôll be back. NIO tanked some of my longs and I bought shares on the way up like a dummy guy, then I sold calls like a boss at the top, then I tried to time the bottom and was off by about 4 dollars on a few things.... all in all I need to stop doing this shit on my fucking phone and actually get serious. Only down 14% for the day and I‚Äôm way up for the year.
I think next week will be a shitshow...

Lockdowns round 2 getting announced already.

You can snipe 10-20% a day if you have the balls and know how. It can backfire occasionally but I have been putting 10% of my portfolio into spy calls/puts in the last 10 minutes of trading everyday for the past month and have averaged about 12.5% with some days upwards of 50% gains in 10 minutes.

Hit hard by the NIO dip but I'm still up 15% overall. Diversification!
Could feel something
If you can give it a month, it will probably get back support.  It just sucks to lock up money that long when there are so many other good plays out there.  Of course I froze up this week and missed buying after the Tuesday drop.

Why is recovery up so bigly today? Been at work all day did I miss some news?
We‚Äôre gonna be chilling next week
My thought is that you all need to stfu with nio. It s high enough and not fun anymore

Over 5k comments today mentioning NIO.

For reference, peak TSLA sentiment was around the same. The most other tickers normally get to are around 10-15% of comments that mention tickers.

Not only that, but after the stock price has doubled, you all are still bullish! Amazing!
I highly doubt it. 

There is an insane amount of money being pumped into telehealth, and this was the case before COVID existed. COVID just accelerated things.

I could see that fucking you up if they kill earnings
Read a summary of the earnings call. Pretty much explains it. They have a lot of government contracts but they‚Äôre also expanding their data collection to commercial and healthcare. Personally I think it‚Äôs gunna be a big win long term

I don‚Äôt agree with you.  There are many diseases a full stop 2 week global shutdown would solve.  However, partial shutdowns do nothing more than stretch things out and transfer wealth and create despair. Where are the net lives saved exactly? You have to assume a successful vaccine before the virus finishes running its course. Meanwhile NYC is already approaching heard immunity.  That means the lockdowns in NYC only moves sicknesses in time, rather than eliminating them.  If you‚Äôd like to fault my logic please be specific.  I‚Äôm trying to learn, always!

NIO - will pop hard after earnings next week get it now
Las number I heard was $50k. Of course there was no mention of where the money was coming from.
I remember when I could feel anything
weird way to say 60. But I got NIO calls priced in for 11/27. I expect it'll settle between 50-55 by the time of expiry
I never asked. I was showing the gains I had made previously.

I learned a long time ago not to listen to anyone on reddit for advice about stocks.
Not me, retard!

Who knows may be they did buy calls yesterday, pumped it in pre market, sold their calls at market open, then loaded up puts and then started shorting.

Who knows!
NIO puts for earnings?? This fun train has to come to an end right?
A lot of people bearish on NIO, what‚Äôs your outlook for Monday?
What if the new factory gets hit by a natural disaster like his last factory? I mean his SUV is called the Ocean and his car was the Karma. He's tempting the gods.
>these chinese ev companies are just car manufacturers

Exactly the opposite. These Chinese EVs, specifically NIO, are much more of a lifestyle than the car manufacturers we have in the west. Hence why there's a NIO fashion house and everything.

About what? Having opinions?
Na dude no one wants that nasty ass meat it's going to $0
I called this selloff in my previous post. It got 0 upvotes. I sold my nio calls before the crash. :)

My thoughts exactly tbh
Lol Which means it bought in today like a retard
I actually dump then pump.
I can't even imagine that
Does the pope shit in the woods?
Yes
I bought 100 shares at $21, so a few days ago I left some money on the table because I too see some real long term potential. Bought the dip at close today as well. If there‚Äôs a big Monday/Tuesday then I‚Äôll sell shares for the profit and the go on a long hold again like you are.
fractional shares are the EASIEST way to make money & it's not even a debate.
You actually want to sell 2 near strikes and buy one farther along the chain so the credit is more than your profit to truly lock it in.  The butterfly.  Just selling the next strike can still lose money in situations where the Delta is significantly different.
Kinda makes you think, where would NIO ,LI and XPEV be if that Citron report didn't come out today? ü§îü§î

Why are you posting this like you are right
"When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found.¬†¬†

One idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.

In fact, the researchers say there‚Äôs good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders."

I can't tell you where the lie is, but there is a lie there somewhere.  My number 1 rule is never pay for tips or recommendations (or courses, programs, seminars, clubs, videos, etc.), no one can tell the future and you're throwing away money.  Don't let someone make money off of you just for telling you the names of the things they trade, you could be doing that!

My crystal ball is broken. If I had to throw a dart at the wall good earnings report will probably mean more investors. If you look at the trend theres a short sell off following the news and then a big pump after. Maybe that was just the institutions pushing it before but either or it doesnt affect me. I bought a while ago and I am holding until they realize the potential I see or something changes and the potential is gone. Neither of those have happened. I'm just here for the memes I typically wouldn't be checking this much hahah

Why didn't you buy calls as you pumped it up?
Titles like COD are annual/cyclical and are priced in their stock. How much more can they possibly squeeze out of their consumers year over year on a title like this? Same for EA and Take Two. They will make their nut with different franchises that will hold longevity on a single release with frequent content release that surpasses a year. Not a title that needs to be purchased "whole" each year for almost the same content and shit microtransactions.

If I‚Äôm holding NIO 25c with a May expiry, it‚Äôs a stupid move to hold till expiry and exercise right? Selling before would give extrinsic value + allow me to buy if I wanted anyways?

It's hilarious how whiny and triggered so many people are over what is essentially a strangely formatted Seeking Alpha article.
yea you can have a cash account with lets say 1k and you can day trade as much as you want until that 1k runs out. then the funds settle the next day. you dont get instant buying power for options like RH. i just use both

I just don't trade options.
The sword swings both ways. Tesla's success shows that EV startups have potential to be legitimate contenders, but Tesla's multiple instances of narrowly avoiding bankruptcy and needing nearly 2 decades to go from red to black show that it's not guaranteed or easy. They also had the luxury of being able to sell cars at ridiculous markup for years to stay afloat until they could scale up due to a lack of meaningful competition, a luxury that startups today do not necessarily have access to.
Yep...
Just all types of retarded FDs trying to chase losses.

You don‚Äôt have to hold till expiration and I would highly advise doing that anyways. Robinhood will always sell spreads close to the money or in the money around an hour before market close on expiration day. 

You wouldn‚Äôt sell the call you sold, you would buy it back. If you open a spread by itself, it‚Äôs just like any other position where you can go to it and buy/ close. Robinhood has a select feature at the top right of the options chain, you would use that to buy back the call you sold and sell the call you bought in one transaction. It would be easy to fill on expiration day especially if it‚Äôs in the money. Hope that helps
How‚Äôre my GME boys doing?


Haven‚Äôt been here since mid October
No one ever plans/can actually tell when it‚Äôs gonna be a 10 bagger dude, but I will say 10 baggers come out of doing good fundamentals/TA. One day you‚Äôll wake up expecting your calls to be up a couple hundo and then the stock will be up 20% PM so just keep at it

How to make lots of money within a few days-

1. Identify which sectors/stocks are running fast
2. Use bots to spam here in wsb
3. Let people buy and run the stocks more
4. Load up with puts
5. Publish a tweet bashing one of the top runner in the sector
6. Short heavily so that scared retail investors panic sell
7. Enjoy your tendies from your puts and cover your short positions slowly

Short sellers couldn't even make it to 10% down while these stocks gained almost 100% in last 2 weeks!
And here we are and SOLO held its ground all day! I'm *probably* gonna cash them out on Monday as I'd be thrilled with what they're worth right now. I could torture myself with the "what ifs" if I keep them but whatever, papa has a credit card with $3k debt on it I'd like to pay off lol

If you watched batteryday, notice Elon suggests future EV design will make battery apart of the chassis. This will have huge impact on weight reduction, weight saving, and thermo management. Of course they will have to make sure battery range and charging cycle are drastically improved which is promised by Papa Elon. Changeable battery do have it‚Äôs advantages if swap station can be readily available, but it can have negative impact on a engineering stand point because you have one detachable component that is super heavy and create a lot of heat.

NIO has been a fun one for me. Sold my January 20c at $46 for a 6 bagger, then got into January 50c when it dipped to $39 this week, then sold those for 200% at $52 today. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm touching it anymore as I don‚Äôt think I can time it any better than that again. Onto other plays! FSR, NIU, PLTR, PSTH my main plays that I rolled NIO money into.

I don‚Äôt see travel ever recovering to what it was ever. This pandemic just proved that you don‚Äôt need to travel to meet a client or do business and everything can be done remotely.

Median 2 family income is about 70k. Well, figure 1.6 million invested at a pretty safe rate of 5% a year gets you 80k a year to to live on. And you still gotta buy your own health insurance if you don't have a job that provides it. Which leaves at about or a little under 70k. 

Not too many of us ripping 1.6 mill in profits. Tell me how and I'll buy your book.

ROPE was looking pretty good for a while there thats for sure.
Yeah but $125k every year is enough for you to fuck around on options all day, and if you get lucky on some big baggers, you would double the 125k, and have even more money to fuck around on options all day.

It's not that they denied a recount, the losing candidate (Trump) did not qualify for a recount because recounts only can be requested if the race is half a percentage point or less. Biden is almost 1 percent up in PA now.

Stop what your trading

Now is a bad tine to be in options.

Wait until the winter is over.

Buy calls on the most financially stable and money making companies in america (top spy companies)

Wait for a weekly dip of any of these companies.
And when in a weekly red dip, buy when the weekly RSI hits 30.

Buy in the money calls with 3-6 month expirations. (I always buy 6months)

Sell at 10% profitability - no exceptions.

Do this over and over and over until rich.

Your welcome; good luck.
My major holdings literally allow me collect dividends and to sell calls weekly to fund my options addiction. Any gains on my big options trade, 50% goes back to buying more long term shit. This way I know how much I have coming in, and how much I'm willing to lose.
Maybe not I agree but it‚Äôs really not that insane is it?

Technical analysis on Tesla stock for week ending 11/14/2020.  Tesla traded within a tight range this week forming a wedge between the 50DMA and uptrend channel.  It will break out or break to the downside in the coming days.  Tesla has been consolidating between $405 and $450 for the past few months now and a big move is coming!  Bull case price target for next week is a breakout of the wedge at $418 then $450 resistance, then $460 and above to make its way back into uptrend channel.  Bear case price target is $405, then $385, and if it breaks that level $360.  

Tesla news this week includes: 

\-Tesla may face delays at Gigafactory Berlin over lack of permits 

\-Tesla is fighting a $14 million fine in Germany over its battery end-of-life policy 

\-Tesla is No. 1 most attractive company for engineering students

Best of luck
I appreciate that man, it can be hard sometimes
unless you're retarded you should still be up on nio lol
I honestly got in big with January 20c because of that post. Was trading at $21 at the time I think. Sold for 600%. Thanks buddy! Had been on my watch list since $3, but he pushed me into buying.
Autistics always try to claim society is greedy and money driven after they just lost a bet over their own greed and money ambitions.  Ironic isn‚Äôt it?
Well we didn't think about all that...
I‚Äôm going to post this DD here, made this last night and mod kept deleting it. Plz allow me op, no hard feelings.

First this is flaired as shitpost because you can think of me as a salty loser gay bear cuz I bought NIO at 4 and accidentally sold at 15(due to wrong limited order).

Now Tesla delivered 140k cars in q3, nio delivered 12k. Tesla has or soon will have five 100% independently owned factories and if my memory is correct four of them are gigafactories. The annual outputs from them are magnitudes ahead of Nio's only JAC owned facility. Tesla owns perhaps the world's most advanced battery IP, FSD IP(maybe MobileEye EyeQ5 is better, we will see next year, calls on Intel btw) and material science IP they can straight use from spacex( New alloys, material processing methods etc) . Nio uses third party batteries and Mobile Eye OEM self drive packages. It is not a bad thing but we are discussing about valuation here.(Plus in the end, you always save more money with Vertical Integration, not the kind Trevor Milton believes) NIO do have interchangeable batteries that's one huge advantage before Papa Elon crack the battery limit. That's my favorite IP from NIO. Business model wise, it seems they are doing the opposite, Tesla like to maximize profit while maintain decent quality, Nio seems emphasize on quality and luxury than making profit. They use to have an edge with cheaper production cost by being a chinese company, but that is gone. Soon made in chxxa model 3 will be all over Asia.

Oh and I almost forgot, Tesla has the single most valuable resource on earth right now, yep Papa Elon. Call him Tech giant, Cult leader, business magnet or whatever you want, this man alone can hold Tesla's "ridiculous" valuation for no reason or all the reason you can think of. So tell me why NIO is worth around 1/6th of tesla. If Tesla's valuation are a hot topic or were, NIO's case is even more extreme. If NIO hits 100 in the next 6 month as a lot of retards hoped which will push its MCAP to over 130B dollars you guys might as well apply for Chxxese citizenships.

Stronger man than I. I‚Äôm out of all my long dated spreads and just playing week to week now till we see how stuff shakes out the next month
Way fucking low - I loaded up today on dec $280 calls
This just in: covid is bad. Oh you knew that? I‚Äôm sorry shorts, you bought the news.

Everyone is like ‚Äúomg lockdowns again!‚Äù as if that‚Äôs much different than what we‚Äôre doing now... 50% capacity, no sports, no big weddings, no concerts...

Covid IS PRICED IN

Please stop buying weekly puts and trying to time the top. You will be wrong. We are headed to all time highs. Long dated as a hedge, sure. You will WRECK YOUR PORTFOLIO IF YOU TRY TO TIME THE TOP.
I think its still got a space to move up. To 8 or 9 bucks
Bro.... SHE... she.
Healthy, definitely healthy
bought some DAL calls and they went up 80% 5 mins from close for no reason, wish I would have noticed, would have cashed out for sure
What word?
Ur mom sent me a picture of you:

about $3.50
The peleton bike is stored in the bathtub
Confirmation on what?
You laugh but I watched in person as spy jumped $10 on vaccine news premarket at the buttcrack of dawn
FDA approval moves it to 42+ IMO
How are they cheap? Dec 20 IV is 100%. LEAPS at 90%.
People who buy NIO at $50 when everyone had already indicated that is when they will take profit.
waymo is geo fenced and is using expensive tech to see it‚Äôs surrounding. if and when tesla figures out the software to fsd waymo will be a pointless company.

This was my best week since August, thank u WSB üôè
Oh yeah I forgot. How silly of me! Let me just pull this 25k from behind my ear. /s
Thanks for the sarcasm. I appreciate it.
Problems with living in Alaska, woke up after the giant spike, I used to wake up for market open but I've decided over time it's just not worth it. Still was in time to sell my 0dte calls at a nice profit, but then I was dumb and bought some more for next week right before the massive dump.
Only ride Americans are ever gonna take from nio
But how did he crack the case so quickly?
Ty. For the lack of near term catalyst , just selling some weekly options both ways .. until the next big one

Nad Jones is related to Jow Dones, I am sure of it.
People who expect triple baggers on options
The idea of living the rest of my life slaving away for a salary to make money for a company who doesn't give a shit about me sickens me to my core.

I trade options because it's the one glimmer of hope I have to maybe have some kind of financial freedom while I'm still young, maybe one of these plays will be the one that sets me free. 

But deep down I know it's unlikely, I'm not skilled or lucky enough and even on the days where I make money I feel nothing because it's not enough. It's not enough to quit my job, it's not enough to pay off my student loans. 

I'll be stuck in the rat race for the rest of my life, every day is more depressing than the last when there's nothing to look forward to. 

I'm so happy for everyone who makes life changing money in the market, you did it against all odds and I hope it makes a difference.
NIO PUMP
PFE to 40 in the next month? I need my calls to print harder.
How are your commissions higher than the account value?
Same boat homie, SPY 365 praying for that weekend gap up round 2
Why do u keep repeating this maybe tryna feel safer and pump ur calls?
Yeah but I like to yolo options
I flipped a coin just now. Calls it is .

So did snap and look what happened there.
Did he or did he not get rid of the red tape that made it possible to create and pass a vaccine that would have other wise took 4-12years YES or NO.  don't answer that. We all know he did.  Facts you don't have to like the dude but give credit where its due soy
Sometimes I‚Äôm mad that options close at 4, but my net worth not fluctuating after hours is kinda good lol
Even when I should have worried about money, I never did. I just lived and kept my eyes on my goals. Probably harder these days with social media and how ‚ÄúI want everything now‚Äù society has become. 

Every day I busted my ass till slowly my accounts went from red to black to way in the black. I had a modest studio apartment, didn‚Äôt have tv, didn‚Äôt go on vacation unless I drove with people and stayed in holiday inns, drank and ate at bars with specials and happy hours and just made the best of everything. I wasn‚Äôt jealous of others I was laser focused on working my ass off to become rich. I never wasted a penny. (Except my gambling issues but it was money I could afford to lose haha)

Now I don‚Äôt have to worry about money, i have my safe accounts for my future, I just play options and risky stocks for fun and to satisfy my gambling issues and when I win I spoil Becky with a remodeled bathroom or something that she wants but still adds value for us. Bought myself a wrangler too cause hey, mans got to drive.

I guess the housing caused it to tank all the way down to almost nothing. If i wasn't in college and broke at that time that would have been a buy along with tesla for me
ATVI is over 90% institutionally owned. It will never ever ever run hard. It just slowly climbs up. An absolutely outstanding company to own long term. Pointless to trade shares or options on.

You're not wrong lol
if you have 2.5 million for options you likely don't give a fuck about the 2.5 million either way (or at least carry the same risk all us retards do). i doubt that's his retirement hahah

Not in the US.
For stocks, I usually place market orders if it's a highly liquid stock/bid as spread is very small. 

Selling is always with limit order.

hold till tuesday babyyyyy
Not a bad day, friend talked me into buying some Li calls late yesterday, sold them right at open and made 4k.  Sold DKNG calls and puts monday, closed today between the two so no wories there. 

 Getting assigned on my MGM covered calls I sold, but it only sold 40 cents above my strike and I sold the call for 75 cents.  Probably sell puts and run the wheel on it.  

Didnt make a killing but feels good to have a winning week.

This is where WSB has gone to shit. It used to be about the tendies, but now it's all this gay shit like bear gang, or bull gang or NIO gang. Bruh post your gains or your losses or shut the fuck up. Like damn which side you're associated with is more important that bigly gains or bigly losses
Fuck the dip

Citron says Tesla will be worth $100. Post split Tesla was right around $100. How were they wrong retard
Around 10k.
I managed to lose money on my cisco FD today. Made it up in march calls and nio puts but shit

I love you WSB.
I would be out here getting high or fucking around but now my whole perspective changed In how I see everything and I will either go
Bankrupt or die a millionaire ü§ë
Don't worry its up again lol. Was down -18$ then up again and then down -14$ and now back up.
I moved in November of last year, much bigger place. I ended up spending the money I'd normally dump into the market on fitting out the house, and yeah man that shit is WAAAAAY more expensive than imagined. 

Afterwards though when COVID hit I said to myself "hell yeah, I ended up spending money on actual stuff that I can use rather than buying right at the top before the world's economy collapsed."

Now the market is acting like COVID never happened, and I'm stuck with a stupid fucking couch instead of ZM leaps.
Just put in $25,000.    It‚Äôs easy.
Weeklies by their very name are only relased weeks in advance you retard.
Gotta become that retarded psychopathic type... it's a good life, normies fear you
Sure but if we don't get it, we'll have a "markets rise in hope" type situation.

Also these contracts are 13.5 theta. You're gonna lose like 2k if we just open flat, not even including any delta working against you.
ü•≠ looking more like üëªü•≠ today
How can I see how much people are buying and selling like in the pic? Is it a program or a broker has this as a tool? Apologies if this is a dumb question. Only been trading for 2 months.

I don't see it moving.
No, he waited until the news stations started calling it to declare victory. Trump literally said he won on the night of the election.
The Pfizer CEO has every right to sell his shares following the spike in share price.  Smart move as it hit a multi-year high.

The vaccine has already been tested on over 45,000 people with no negative effects reported.  According to Dr. Fauci, Pfizer's vaccine will be available to certain groups of people before the end of the year (2020).   Pfizer has projected having 50 million doses ‚Äî enough for 25 million people ‚Äî by the end of the year, and 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  

Source:  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/09/covid-vaccine-in-december/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/09/covid-vaccine-in-december/) 

Puts on airlines and cruise companies that haven't gone down yet?  WTF?  Where have you been the last nine months?  AAL is sitting at $12 (down from a 52wk high of $31).  CCL is sitting at $16 (down from a 52wk high of $52)  Go ahead and short airlines and cruise companies further, but you had better be ready to close that trade quickly because I'm not sure there is much downside left at this point.  Biden closing them down for 4 more weeks would be like pissing in the ocean it won't matter much.  There is an enormous pent-up demand for travel and if the vaccine is available to all Americans by spring/summer break, the airlines and cruise companies will be recovering quickly.  

Lastly, nice DD, you fucking pleb.  The fucking company you were whining about is Pfizer.  The ticker is PFE.  Goddamn this sub is going to hell.
I mean just ride the fucking wave is what I mean, people were saying this was too high at $20 and if you had the balls you rode that shit up to now and even further. NIO 50c 11/20

I have not achieve retard strenght yet. I actually bought stocks.
Not sure, looked at AAL chart and saw the earliest day was 2013 but figured it had to be around longer than that so just did a quick Google search and read about AAMRQ which was the parent company of American Airlines at the time.
Oh yeah that‚Äôs been an option for a while. What they just released is the app will now automatically change depending on your system light/dark instead of manual toggling
Holy shit, I didn't know the world's greatest detective, J.B. Fletcher, was on this sub.

Just buy off ebay since you already have $1k, save your time so you can spend it here trading with the rest of us.
Yes definitely buy that nio dip
Lose it all and don't tell anyone
It keeps happening
Whole foods.
CCL leaps
I step out of the shower and my daydream ends.
Good luck!
Defeated. Lots of bearish sentiment and fucking HUGE breadth in buying this week just really tough to call for a significant drop.

But- I will say there is also a lot of bullish sentiment out there about the vaccine, fewer aggressive shorts and a very popular narrative about seasonality being extremely bullish which could be interpreted as a contrarian signal. Overall short term trend is clearly up but I have my doubts about how long small caps can run given historical valuations and even if they do, whether large cap tech can remain as stretched and crowded as it is.

TL;DR I haven‚Äôt a fucking clue
Plz
ÈöèÊú∫
...that doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about airplanes to argue it.
Wanted to buy calls then immediately inversed myself because I‚Äôm a fucking retard that never picks right so bought spy puts. 

You guys are welcome for the Green Day I‚Äôm delivering you.
January 2022 isn‚Äôt a lotto ticket...

Am I the only one who thinks "donkey kong" everytime I see the ticker?
I've done well enough for myself and have enough cash to play with that a 5k gamble on amc wouldn't hurt me at all if I lost it all.
My portfolio wouldnt even notice a $5k loss.

I made 14k today day trading.
Made $76k last week.
Up over $300k in the last 4 months.

Down 55k overall on my long holds; but that's the nature of this business.

No big deal at all.
Hey man think about it the less co workers there are the less competition for promotion or pay raises and with less people on the payroll they might be inclined.
Is that really going to happen though?
sorry lmao i replied to the wrong comment. got a different reply about climate change. just change whatever i said to apply to you and my point still stands
Next time try to lose money so I can be entertained by the loss, thanks
[deleted]
It‚Äôs more than enough to live on though. You can pursue a side project you‚Äôve always dreamed of doing or do another job to bring in some extra income.
So far my trading strategy has been to lose $500 and then make it back by the end of the week.
It just needs to be hyped. No fundamentals nor financials needed.
Yeah thats nonsense.
I know NIO is. But are XPEV/LI also worth more than Ford?
>Moderna insider trading seems like they have the inside scoop on their vaccine progress we could see a repeat of Monday

We'll see I don't plan on staying in these positions until expiry. Will likely get out of them early on Monday if it goes my way
Lol yup, I really over leveraged calls and started second guessing so I bought a bunch of way OTM puts in case it drops heavy. Like you said, definitely not staying flat but no idea which way it‚Äôs going to shoot
you can never change what people say to you , only the way you let it affect you.

But then again I'm risking thousands of dollars on options on the daily so wtf
>It‚Äôs not garbage but purchased from oem suppliers

That really gives me the feeling that their cars are going to have extensive battery problems due to inconsistent third-party manufacturing and that they are going to burn through batteries quickly. Also thinking that there could be consumer issues in that people will get good batteries switched out for bad ones and they won't know until they get stranded somewhere or something starts on fire. No one will want to claim responsibility
hahaha same :(

Yeah that's what I was thinking too. Moderna maybe?

Sorry to hear that brother! We're all gamblers here and we win some and lose some; ultimately though it's just money and not worth doing anything permanent over a temporary situation.

Take note of what specific mistakes you made and you'll be fine in the grand scheme of things.
Remember when I flipped a coin and I was right???!!???
pretty hard to do when theyre worth more than Ford
Oh, didn't know that.

I primarily meant since summer. The balance sheets at that time pointed to NCLH as having more cash on hand at the beginning of the pandemic and through it, which could be interpreted as being more fiscally responsible. At minimum, if all three took the same amount out in loans (obviously a hypothetical) it would nean NCLH would last the longest. So, I went with who I figured would be more likely to survive long term
Puts on your intelligence
I ain‚Äôt getting that shit at least 6 months after it‚Äôs out
Moderna and that vax one
Dont you think they would have announced something at this emergency presser if it was coming out? At least hint at it "Next week we will announce a moderna vaccine". The presser was so lame and revealed no new info we didn't know on Tuesday
NCLH $25 Monday.

edit 2: glitch
Well today was a good day. Didn't even need nio to make tendies
Something you do at night when your wife's boyfriend isn't home
A lot of so called wisdom being thrown around. "Nio fall from grace was guaranteed, told you."

This type of shit is not clever or original. You're just being CONvientent. And it's laughable these are the same people who likely criticized Tesla's epic run. These people have no imagination, lack gut/intuition amongst other boring tidbits in their lives.

We are in Nio for the home run and many have hit multiple grand slams. The game just started 

Lastly, have some balls. Scared money don't make money.
yeah. 8% dip.....huge selloff...

They‚Äôve actually had a buy rating on NIO for the last 2 years. It‚Äôs only after it‚Äôs run up 3000% that they think it‚Äôs going to go down. Go figure!
The next smart move would be to put that 1200 into shares of NIO then have 5k next year
Nobody tell him
yea good call. I'm all in or all out at this point even a flat day would crush the value of mine

ZM going vroom next week
Was waiting for a KCAC post. Sold my calls today for +400%. Shoulda bought more

Market responded to teh vaccine announcement like it was already in the mail to millions. Corona cases are 150k a day and rising. They haven't gotten FDA approval. The only thing they could have announced in that presser that would have made me nervous is a new vaccine that was >90% effective or an FDA approval on the pfizer one.

You have to think in terms of percentage and not cash amount. We literally only dipped 7.5% for the day. We've been making that in gains DAILY consistently. NIO isn't going anywhere man. Glad I could be of assistance my friend and goodluck to you.

It‚Äôs not garbage but purchased from oem suppliers, they lack IP on autonomous driving and battery tech. Car is decent, but business model is difficult to work as Tesla focus on cutting cost and profitability and Nio focus on built quality plus reputation. You can say Tesla was using the same strategy but that is a by gone era. The market is quite mature now and Nio need to prove they can actually make money like BYD.

My reasoning was that people were pumped about the vaccine early this week but no dates were give on wide distribution. People were/are overly optimistic on when it can be distributed and the April date is further out than what most people would have expected. I consider my odds about 5050 at this point
VIX isn‚Äôt going to spike again is it? üòî

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm counting on. I went balls deep on LI calls today. Bought the top (obviously) then leveraged down throughout the day. Really need NIO to carry the whole team.
Just woke up from a dream where NIO gapped down to 11 (I own puts), and I was happy. I went to sell, and it was actually a gap up to 77. The end.

If you are unemployed and trading for an living, you can turn yourself into a trader by establishing a company (it can be sole proprietor, so no major paper work) and opening a self-401k. You can park up to $53k into a retirement self-401k (or whatever this year‚Äôs threshold is) per year. So you‚Äôre lowering the taxable income. Also you should do your major yolos in an IRA and you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about this. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I think tech was on sale this week. People sold too quickly off of virus hype. New Mexico just announced lockdown for two weeks. NY and Oregon seem poised to follow. Who knows who else after that. 

Last lockdown business owners said even one day had a noticeable financial impact, so even two weeks is huge. With new brand name companies popping up every few weeks, how long are value stocks gonna hold their weighting when their recovery timetable keeps getting pushed back. Vaccine or not.

I hope it's all prosecuted too but it's looking like it's pretty much negligible like you said. I really can't fathom the 2-3 million flipped votes that trump claimed yesterday on Twitter. If he had enough basis to claim that, shit would already be going down.
I will say once position or ban
Thats why you but Penny stocks? üòÇ
When I think green innovation + free market I think China.
You could be right. I waited until a big green day, near ATH. 

I'm not sure that the blood is out of the water yet from a civil unrest standpoint, and wanted to have exposure to any downwards movement from that as well.
You all really are retarded
Have you seen one of their "cars"? Do you really have so little respect for your own time spent earning this money to want to put your money on this? 

Surely, this post must be in jest.
Pltr is fucking around too
I don‚Äôt think so. I think earnings will be real good and the fomo train will pick up again, countered by all shorting and the spooking I think we will end up right about where we are now

NVDA is gonna moon!

How you been doing brother
I just find it fun to be honest, always some new theory to try, always something you could improve etc it‚Äôs like a never ending puzzle. Would like to add that I am by no means rich but lucky enough to never had to worry about necessities
Oh, please. You don't know shit lmao. I have no stake in this game - I made money on calls yesterday and on puts today, but acting like you know exactly what's going to happen especially with a stock like this, at a time like this is stupid, guy
I suspect the whole "battery switching" aspect they are trying to sell is just a way to hide the fact that their battery technology is hot garbage
My 0dte 365 SPY calls say green!!
I just been in and out of positions each day. 60k account so I got plenty of $$ to work with each day. Haven‚Äôt had a red day in like a month now, I think.
>Lol dude the company that did the report is obviously short selling. 

Why do people say this like it's a bad thing?  Would you expect a company to say a stock is worth $50 while selling it at $25?
need all the luck I can get appreciate it
Where this the same fuckers that got ENPH down in May only for it to moon to its ATH recently?
Ban. 


Calls. Always.
No NIO no nut. It‚Äôs only going to be satisfying if it‚Äôs a loss from one of the retards pumping NIO for the last week
Less pollution = good for everyone.
No way it can stay propped up like this. After hearing vaccine is further out than initially estimated and a few states are locking down? I will sleep good tonight. I‚Äôm out for 15-30% savings.
BABA call holders the type of guys who bend their wrists when giving a pound.
Learn the difference between correlation and causation. They didn't research any chemical pathways or receptor binding, etc. They just did a statistical analysis which means very little. If you try to find patterns, you'll find them in everything. I bet Blood type O are 70% more likely to go bowling. This is stupid.

Edit: Notice also how they don't tell you how less likely a person of Type O blood is to get infected with Covid? Is it 90% less likely? 1% less likely? Who fucking knows.
Airplanes were new and unproven technology

I hope ccl opens at 20 so I can buy puts again, took profits a little too early last time
You mean these bags of gold?
I've been kicking around, haha. 

Picked up a 30% gain on PCG calls about a month ago, then a 10% gain on DME earlier this month. 

We'll see what I get with IWM puts.

And next time don‚Äôt bet on Chinese shit, Day Traitor.
How?
I‚Äôd give my gainz this week for a return back to normal by spring
Why them?
From $250 -> $1.7k this week because of the Chinese EV stocks. My NIO put paid off big time today. Best week I‚Äôve ever had
Until the stock stays flat or goes down. Then it‚Äôs all gone LOL
Until futes open blood red Sunday

No shit Sherlock

Yeah, I‚Äôm referring to tracking covid and infections which has been half mentioned for the UK I believe. I assume it won‚Äôt be released publicly because it will be done through cell phone data and interactions is my guess. From my understanding the company works on the fringe and will do a bit more risky ethical business.
I wish I had MFA money. I just know everything this sub touches goes to shit and I‚Äôm an autist like the rest.

Why are airline stocks pumping?
1. You're all mad about a short report that is fundamentally no different than what people typically write about on Seeking Alpha.  
2. You're mad that people actually care about what Citron Research has to say.
3. You're mad that Citron Research is probably right and it's inconvenient for your trading.

It would make sense. Cases are blowing up. CA super liberal. Stop spread before holidays/ blk friday. I was thinking same thing this week that it could happen. OP has 9yo acct, doesn‚Äôt post often. Seems legit. Buy zm and pton
God I hope so.... I think they will; there's nothing holding it back at this point

I wonder what kind of data plan teslas have to be able to upload so much data and I wonder when do they sync it or if they are any privacy regulations on this data
Ticker is wrong you retard
This didn't age well lmao
Fake and Gay airline pump
It's on a Friday though, market can't dump if it's closed.
Probably trying to pump that "presidency has aged me" photo comparison despite looking exactly the same 4 years ago
SOLO gonna stick between 6-6.50. Cause I have 20 7.50 calls and 25 5.5 puts. You‚Äôve been warned
Randy is that you????
PCG is your friend
LMAO nio bagholders how are you feeling today?
The fact that this kind of comment got upvotes should tell you to buy puts
I think we had goals at the beginning before joining the market, now it feels like it‚Äôs a part of me. I forgot what life was like before this
Hahaha wtf dude. Yes you can. Hahahaha omg
Have 300p let‚Äôs hope it drills to gyna
I saw it exploded this morning but I actually have a real job, and figured I'd unload for the weekend around noon. Still (barely) above breaking even, guess we'll see what happens Monday. Because I actually have on-site responsibilities and can't dick around with this all day every day. 

Every time I think "I can make money on options" I should just buy VGT or VCR and let it ride.
This is the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen on this sub

so no new vaccine news, but AMC still pumping AH on a stupid pointless mango speech, very cool
Lmfao at best??? Nobody listen to this shit. NIO is literally the biggest of the three and its reporting earnings Tuesday. We'll be just fine. Big money players used this drop to shake off the small timers and take their gains. That same big money will pump this shit right back up and profit on that too. Just gotta ride the wave correctly
Yeah, for now, but be aware of brexit. IB are brittain based and their  branches in Luxembourg and Ireland have not yet obtained all licenses and stuff, so if the brexit will happen soon, IB might not provide the level of service as usual for a while.
You put your life savings into FDs/gambling? You belong here.
Hello cash gang friend. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling. Love rooting for the downside because this market is out of touch with reality. Hoping for a good down leg soon!
Dows 70 from beginning of year. Literally any good news is going to make it go up massive
Instead of betting on one company to develop it, just bet on travel and shit.
damn then I guess I was really unlucky that it popped OTM at 3pm then went straight back ITM...

PFE agreed to sell the vaccine to the US Gov for a set amount; they did NOT get tendies from the Federal Gov to develop it = they were NOT part of OWS.
Green Monday upvote, red downvote
They didn't redye it, if incumbents are up for reelection they usually go for the gray hair, as it has shown to gather more votes. 

Challengers usually dye their hair to appear younger and more aggressive.

Obama did the same thing.
Rough guy, take a break and re-assess.

Down 10k past 2 weeks, but very small % of nw. It‚Äôs painful when they do ya so dirty
That‚Äôs true I can agree. It would be ideal for a day trade

Christian Fromhertz, Michael Burry, Mike Baum, Steve Sosnick and some older Cramer(pre-08). I like to listen to their psychology behind trading and the keys they look for when trading.

Okay but what are gonna do now till the vaccine is available. We got record cases, hospitals filled, and Donnie says a shut down is stupid. Health care workers getting a vaccine is good but it doesn‚Äôt stop the spread at all for the common person. We still got 5 months of this if it‚Äôs available in April.
Yeah, talking about voting software issues, voter fraud, etc, etc when they have no fucking idea what they're talking about.  The anecdotal examples of ballots for dead people, etc, etc, all exist in every single election.. *ever* (various eras have various types of fraud).  They're being held up as something that's swinging the election, when they're insignificant, statistically speaking.  But, of course, 'influencers', media people, and the common fucktards are parroting this shit like they 'know' something.  The only thing happening is they're riling up the chicken coup, that's it.

Full disclosure: I think all election fraud should be prosecuted.

Did anybody else catch that slip where he almost said ‚ÄúThe Biden administration‚Äù when talking about lockdowns?  He caught himself before he finished the thought, but he HAS acknowledged that he‚Äôs lost at this point, though it may be some time and more failed lawsuits before he states it publicly.  That shit will be the greenest fucking day ever like +$20 on SPY.
$40 is the best Pfizer can ever give us.
No, but market will still price it in
On expiration day, with contracts ITM, and unless you have the $ or shares to cover puts/calls, RH will close your options about an hour or so before the closing bell.

Close your spreads on RH. Especially the short legs.
My 3rd weekend in a row straight cash homie. Feels good given the current market conditions. Some serious fuckery going on. I‚Äôm going all in if spy breaks 360 next week tho cuz everyone‚Äôs gonna try to short the ATH.

Down 4k, after this week. Confident in BABA calls for next week though
Just build a house lolol
Anyone else on Stwd calls?
what are yall vaccine plays?
I don‚Äôt get why Beyond sinks with the COVID stocks. Are they really basing their value on people stocking up on fake meat while at home??
Damn mango. Knew there was gonna be vaccine talk during the weekend lmao.

Good luck
You guys literally trade blind.
What will spy open up at Monday
Some will because I bet, international travel will require proof of vaccination.

Still a net + barely, but Jesus my timing is horrid.
Yes 70 year olds usually have white hair...
I think it could go either way

Is this some type of autistic low key advertisement or something
I got puts near EOD. Am i fucked?
Idk. Health care workers probably will. Not sure if seniors will.
this dude got puts.  saying this is a bubble
Who truly believes that they found the vaccine... cmon...how many times have been blue balled by these sons of bitches?
Yeah, I realized I was probably stressing for no reason. Switched from my day/week chart to a 3 Month chart and it gave me goosebumps.

Let‚Äôs meme SOLO and SPCE next week (SOLO is another EV stonk and SPCE has a flight next weekend.
Mar 2021? That gives absolutely plenty of time. 

Thanksgiving spike will play out early Dec. Christmas spike will play out early Jan. Things may be bad enough by Jan 20 that Biden may have to "follow the science" and do another shutdown, which would dictate market movements for 6 weeks. 

Mar 2021 puts captures the whole move.

From what I've seen online, NIO makes a really nice car.
Probably stimulus related

It‚Äôs asking me to set a price limit
its wsb
which one did you sell?
I pumped and dumped this morning. It was fun. Let's do it every day
Just need to piss on it
This thread will likely have a lot of people feeling a sense of schadenfreude at your expense, but I would like to say that the only reason for this is because, ultimately, you were unable to succeed. 

The only thing that would justify a risky position is success itself. 

"Agent A succeeds, while agent B fails, and although every relevant consideration appears to be the same in both cases, we nevertheless judge A more favorably than B."

i shorted at 154 today, covered at 150.5 and shorted again at 151.5 end of day. This thing also gives up gains

Nothing is a guarantee but it's better to invest in a few Chinese EV companies instead of putting all you money into one. Those two seem like the best bets right now but Li auto could be the one too

WSB when Citron says go long on NIO at $7: haha lemon you dumb fuck it's now under $2!

(NIO eventually rockets thru $30, approaches $40 and WSB fomos in.)

WSB when Citron says pump is unsustainable and mentions realistic PT $25: omg lemon you fucking ruined us, who the fuck do you think you are reeeeeeeeeeee

Looking back at the SPY charts, what was it that triggered the September 20 drop? I forgot already.
Damn, SPCE is like the cold McDonalds fries under your seat from that time Jessica farted and everyone thought it was super awkward but kinda funny
We need a new meme stock like JMIA or something
cant tell if ur being serious or not but either way ur retarded
because it's fucking reckless.
Im down $5500 for the day on NIO and I'm chillen. Enjoy your weekend, keep it off your mind. Monday and Tuesday will do us right.
i did but this pattern day trader shit i didnt close now monday iv will surely fuck me
The most important thing here is that Donald Pump has white hair now

the WSB cycle

- 5 actual smart people tell the sub why they should buy XYZ stock

- 20 semi-smart people listen to the DD and buy in

- months go by

- XYZ erupts 

- 25 people post massive gain porn

- 9 million retards get fomo and decide now is the time to buy

- run up continues for another 2-3 days. 

- smart money cashes out after influx of RH traders catch on

- stock crashes >20% 

- 8.99 million retards complain and only 5 brave souls post loss porn
NIO may come out but they need to ramp up production capabilities before the others have a firm grip on the market. Tesla recently opened a factory in china and is coming out with a cheap option. Build quality on a Tesla I think is going to make NIO feel like every other chinese car. Hopefully both companies do well
Everyone thinks it‚Äôs already going to be green Monday?? So you mean red?

There are different kind of tests, some are more accurate but slow (PCR), some are fast but less accurate (antigen test). No one has been saying tests are 100% accurate, I don't know what you mean by "they were science". Maybe if all you watch is Fox Propaganda News.

Trump is better when he doesn‚Äôt feel the need to campaign. This was more about his legacy. Still a lying piece of shit though.
Shoulda waited a week for that trade. You are prolly gonna feel like a 98 lb weakling in Rikers next week.  Tsk.
Thank god I‚Äôm only holding nio. Nio don‚Äôt give a fuck about vaccine news
You‚Äôre retarded
It wouldn‚Äôt make any difference to you regardless. You don‚Äôt understand statistics or how immunology works lol.

You can do both.

I have a background in both government work and technology, so it's kinda funny I ended up picking palantir as my favourite stock this year.

 ‚ÄúSPY all time highs! Dow Jones doing great!‚Äù Tweet incoming
Lol I meant retail. $2.5M is nothing for a bank but $2.5M at 31 is literally retirement money if you're safe. Atleast diversify and set up a strangle to protect against downside
You can make it all back by revenge trading with even higher risk!
So, you‚Äôre 4,5 down, and holding over the weekend.  Monday could be interesting.  What‚Äôs your maximum downside?
"oh yeah? that right bitch?? LOCK DOWN!"  -New York, this weekend....
no the othe way around

the antixvax are not going to want the bidone vax
And that was the best they could come up with. You know behind closed doors they know they are fucked
Hell nah. Holding till 2030, this is a 20 bagger at least
Fuck these guys. I hope they really get shut down.
I have puts
more like getting swept on the first round and skip the press conference
yeah, except for the part where massive amounts of testing is usually done, data collected, and rick assessment done.  But, you know, fuck all that shit since "we" just want to push it over the line and be able to say it was done in record time.
Lol me too, said fucket and got some LI calls when it was at 38 going up to 40.  Quickly got got and smh. Fomo cost me 1500 today

Did they even talk to PFE and MRNA before making this press release? They kept saying shit like "PFE will apply to FDA soon and MRNA will announce results next week"....etc. yet not a single person from these companies present.
My holdings could care less about that conference
Too early
It's full of paper handed novice retail traders.
I feel attacked

You‚Äôre retarded. It‚Äôs gone up 3000% it‚Äôs not a fucking growth stock anymore it‚Äôs a GROWN stock. It‚Äôs already valued more than the biggest companies in the world. Even if it did sell the same amount as all the other car companies IN THE FUTURE why is it valued more than them NOW. Where is the room for growth now that it‚Äôs basically the largest car company before it‚Äôs even sold cars?? Why would it keep going up at this point? The literal perfect future is priced in already
I will never get those 20 mins back. What a waste of time
Because they will get pumped over the weekend
It‚Äôs just market manipulation, Someone was salty cause he missed out on NIO earlier so they wrote an article
Dude I bet Tesla is paying people to write shit articles to scare people into panic selling and trying to affect NIOs gains because they want to dominate the Asia market. Sorry Elon it‚Äôs not happening the people of China chose NIO get over yourself and accept that you have a competitor that can actually go against you.

Run it through a business and pay myself through investments into a solo401k, health savings account, health insurance paid, basic living expenses paid, and possibly make a non profit to cycle some money through if you need a side way of feeding yourself with significantly less taxes.

basically that was a retirement ceremony.  Actually wasn't bad, the vaccine developments are really an amazing feat from a scientific standpoint.

people are so fucking dumb.  they see things that they have no goddamned background in and are like, "holy shit, that shit's fucked up!  they're doing it wrong!  they're cheating!".. it's how ancients ended up worshiping the sun, sacrificing babies to the monkey god, etc.  so many fucking morons in our society
That's what I do after i nut. thank you very much and turn around and leave
I'm sure he won't miss the opportunity to speak about 5 more times, but they should have had this sign language lady out there for other events. Makes it seem more bland and mundane, which is probably what would have drawn more average people to vote for him.
Your mom‚Äôs naive!

This a Wendy‚Äôs sir I‚Äôd appreciate if you did not address my poor investment decisions

Modern was the only company Pence mentioned. Hint hint
A clap is the percussive sound made by striking together two flat surfaces, as in the body parts of humans or animals. Humans clap with the palms of their hands, often quickly and repeatedly to express appreciation or approval (see applause), but also in rhythm as a form of body percussion to match the sounds in music, dance, chants, hand games, and clapping games.

Hope so, went all in on puts end of day. Market has been super hyped about a vaccine without knowing when it would be available. Only thing that I thought would cause the market to go up was a new vaccine announcement. The april date given makes me feel good

Why long lol isn‚Äôt this bad news for them or am I just retarded. Or both
what is the market hearing that im not? what new information are we learning here?
Yep.  The purpose is to prevent tax shenanigans, like selling and rebuying on 12/31/20 for a loss to deduct in 2020.
I know right. It really is THAT easy
Not at all. Great dip to buy rn.
Oops was looking at vxx options prices instead of UVXY. Those are still retardedly otm and wouldn‚Äôt be worth buying.

lol mango looks funny standing to the side, arms down. always out my hand in my pockets when standing
This wasn't a helpful conference. It feels more like a hey remember us in 2024 because the vaccine was approved before 2021.
More like ginger snaps
^ this too
You write like a fgt went thru a gay conversion therapy. Are you?
So if Trump is president the vaccine can‚Äôt be trusted but if Biden is president we‚Äôre going to strap you down and force you to get it.

A tangible goal for a functioning vaccine was estimated to take minimally a year and a half. Until, president Trump had a brilliant, completely outside the box idea...what if they made it faster. I was blown away

He is disappointed because he thought 'ego' meant 'pp'
You'd think Pence would have sense enough to lay low for a year to have a shot in 2024
Watch the FDA deny the vaccine
It won‚Äôt really cost you 4K unless you panic sold. Your shares will be back up next week my dude

please tell me, i‚Äôm new to this
This administration needs to WARPSPEED their way out
*ONE Chinese stock.

The "one" is important. My Chinese holdings have consistently outperformed my US holdings, and that is perfectly normal since their economy is going much faster. 

But when you gamble, especially all in on call options with a week expiry date, of course you're going to lose crap tons of money eventually. That's 0 diversification with huge risk.
Citron said Tesla was too high in February. NIO is pole position in China. People who sold today are clowns.
Yea it‚Äôs surprising. I feel like anything short of a new vaccine announcement will cause a dip on Monday
Holy fuck you are so dumb.

I work with  lot of early adopters (18 - 30 y/o) who have been upgrading every year just to have the latest iPhone for clout and the people I've spoken to don't think it's worth upgrading from a 11 or XS.

I also use public transport daily to get to work and again, still haven't seen a single 12 so far.

A step further, usually around Christmas my nieces and nephews are hinting that they want cash to get the newest iPhone. Not this year, the ps5 is higher on the list followed by gift cards for online apparel retailers.

I think that lockdown made people not care as much about being seen with last gen phones. Everyone's more excited about getting new clothes and shit so they look good when stuff reopens.

From my anecdotal evidence, I'm anticipating low demand so I'm going to inverse with puts.
Ban this
Elon so annoying.  Like bro, if you got a problem, just make your own tests and boost the stock price ok
Tech was red af today fuck u mean
Selling JD calls for 500% at open. Easy peasy.

4000. If you sell at a loss then rebuy within 30 days, Basically the loss gets deferred until the next time you sell.
Well it did break out for a big gain today. Played some 0dtes for a small gain. Feels good to be autistic
I can piss in a vial and say you have a vaccine in seconds.  Doesn't mean it works or is safe.
I was following all the tech IPOs that couple week period when like palantir, unity, corsair, asana, and snowflake went public.

What really drew me into Palantir was Thiel and Karp to honest.

The more I learn about them, the more I am convinced in their company.

The real selling points for me is Thiel's ties to Facebook and SpaceX. Plus I think Karp has the personality to build a cult following like Elon Musk.

And the cherry on top for me, is that both Thiel and Karp on the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group. These guys are connected as hell.

Also, you should Google "Project Maven Palantir".
Only WSB can rationalise a global pandemic as a good thing for their credit card rewards.
neopets was my first hustle. I used to run programs that found random items and I would sell the "rare" stuff for actual money via paypal on some forums. I only made a little over a hundred bucks but i was like 13 and felt like a genius

Two possible üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èoutcomes from mango election statement when it does come:

If he contest and maintains he won, promising to take his evidence all the way to his SC...bearish.

In event he concedes what stops him from going out blazing crashing market so he can say I told you so.

ü§Ø
I am a threetard
Dude where did I say 20k cars is 30%? I said if they make that, which actually isn't just my dd, jp Morgan also has that prediction.and if you look at everything how is 30% that lofty? Even if its fucming half that THATS 1 MILLION CARS A YEAR IN 1 MARKET. Stupid fuck. Who the fuck invests in a stock other than for growth potential? They're two years old, how many cars were tesla selling in 2010? Even then you think I have my entire lifes savings in this? No fuxming shit nothing is a garauntee you stupid fuck. At least nio is delivering on their promises and now has government backing. Other players in this segment have been running on hype and fraud for 10 years and they have a market cap of over 300 billion... for 4 fucking cars. Thats the precedent
Actually was so cringe, in fact the whole thing is cringe
Wow you went from +5 to -11 on that comment so fast...sheeple gonna sheeple

Spy 340 Monday!
I'm so salty. I bought a bunch of 1dte $45p yesterday just as a bit of a hedge for all my calls, figured they'd probably expire worthless.

Woke up to NIO at $50 and figured I might as well sell them while they were worth a few cents... I'm rather upset with myself.
No
This is so cringe
This is feeling like a farewell thank you event for mango lol
This guy trades on Saturday like a boss

I was like wtf! Can't believe the lemon boys did that minutes after market open. They obviously loaded up on a massive short position right before the tweet then dumped a ton of stock. 

They drop the tweet literally 2 minutes after i was balls deep in calls, but I was like everyone knows this is overvalued right?

Wrong. Went from +50% to -50% in 10 min, what a wild ride. Ended the day green tho, can't complain.

That vaccine is scary. I'm not an anti-vax but the Pfizer vax is an mRNA vax. If it is approved it will be the 1st mRNA vax ever and no one will have studied its long term effects and it will be rushed through due to hysteria from media. Let retarded blue voters be the ones to try it.

Mango really holding the vaccine hostage against NY lol so fucking petty bro
Big noob question but why does the chart look so horrible when you take a 5y basis?
Of course, you think a short company with consistent rack records of TSLA, ZM, PTON, and more would not learn from their lesson?  They were long Luckin.
General can't read too gud
This sub is fucking ridiculous. You would think y‚Äôall have never traded before

Thats CNN bullshit, he could have bowed before ü•± like a conquering king, do you really believe Don Lemon would praise him for it?

I mean yeah but I buy lottos all the time with like 2-5% of my account value. It‚Äôs fun as fuck and when they print it‚Äôs a hot ass %. But like who‚Äôs selling that at .01? That‚Äôs a waste of an option. I‚Äôd rather throw away $1 than be subject to limitless losses.
I‚Äôve never seen such a ‚ÄúYes Man‚Äù in my LIFE.
i'm just sticking around to see trump get grilled by reporters questions
Are they more popular than Tesla doe

How weak is Nio that one short can cause that much disruption..
Imagine thinking Monday will be red when Mondays tend to be the strongest rally days.
Big vaccine news on the tele now.... pretty sure a gap up
Clitron suck my pp
Gen pop should have it by April. Lot of bullshit to wade through to find the real info..
following market trends is never a bad idea, hope you gave yourself enough time though
No vaccine for New York lol
we're about to reach peak anti-vaxxer in the US

get your popcorn, this will be entertaining
Valid points.
When did he become ü•≠?
alright, so the gist of this presser seems to be PTON back to ATH
No. I‚Äôm autistic not retarded. About 50% tho
ü•≠ would have gapped up in the election if he did this pump regularly. Instead he ignored rona paid the big price.
It must hurt being that retarded
Just Google "solo 3 wheeler". Thinking again you are probably looking at the car already.

BIG FUCKING VACCINE PUMPS INCOMING
You can have my spot.

I lost about that much too but I‚Äôm up 49% for the year on my long term stuff so I‚Äôm not complaining.

The market is weird.
We are talking options here aren't we? It's all about timing. thats literally what an option is.  You can buy a leap and have it plummet to 0 after a year, or even 3
we aint holding long term lol we doin daily flips here

Imagine mango‚Äôs sole purpose of this press is to tell everyone top is in
Like a true boomer
Same for nikola, but look where that went. Retard that goes for everything
Wrong! It's buy high, sell low.
Only reason I‚Äôm long right now is because there are too many bears and market tanks when least expected (ex Election). P/C ratio is high that‚Äôs a supporting indicator.
Priced in
It's been on my watch list for over a month, but has only went down, even with all the EV/ China hype. It pops at earnings but then settles back to 7.
listen Mango , either pump or dump the market , wtf you waiting till 4 to bore everyone on a friday for?
Half the sub is gonna be gone when nio tanks next week lmao
Go away
Fisker is better than nio prove me wrong

Hey man- just wanted to say I appreciate that you correct yourself and give us fair warning. Definitely builds trust in the calls you‚Äôre making.
Since I last posted 14 minutes ago that FVAC would hit $14 next week it hit $14.13 in AH.

Good luck to you brother. I understand you, I like NIO too, just not anywhere close to this price.

They still are only selling 5,000 cars a month, if that. $20-25 is more reasonable, but still wayyy high valuation considering the amount of competition they have with Li and XPENG.
See you back at 50 next week
nah
Sup boys I‚Äôve been gone since before the lection, we smokin on that SPY put pack again üòà
I would imagine the public health data over the weekends sucks - so I would imagine the hard numbers on how fucked we are overall won‚Äôt be out until Monday evening.  Edit:  bullish
ZZZZZ
My biggest regret is not holding nio yolo calls and sell on open like I was going to. Then not buying nio puts near the top and instead averaging down on spy. Then I had no more tendies for nio puts again.
Cruise stocks recovered real nicely today. Of course I had a short position.
If anti trumpers wont take it and antivaxxers won‚Äôt take it who‚Äôs left?
Well, my state just shut down again. Should have bought more calls. Bears r fuk.

What platform is this to view this flow?
They have earnings on Tuesday with Target and Walmart. Planning to sell on Monday.:) im already up by 500 on both.
If you buy puts on the indices I don‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôm talking from experience in saying over the long term you are fucked. This market is designed to go up and has the backing of the fed who is able to create liquidity at will in order to inflate asset prices.
Why I got calls
I think Pee Ton is the next $100billion+ market cap stock. Change my mind.
Equipped with battle nipples?!?
Haha man that's ugly as fuck...still making calls on it tho lmao

IM NOT DOIN IT! I‚Äôve been autistic since the early 90‚Äôs from forced school vaccinations so if I get another one I‚Äôll probably go full retard
[deleted]
The fact that he keep stumbling and keying on key words, does not make this very reassuring...
Did he actually say when the vaccine is ready or just soon and we did it so fast.
why does the market still listen to these schmucks when they're not even credible. Its almost slanderous
#CALL ON NYC?? Imagine this trial Vaccine turns out really shtty and higher fatality rate than Covid itself ??!!
lmao, little shit!
‚ùÑÔ∏è
Last week NIO bottom was 39 this week it‚Äôs 44. This isn‚Äôt hard to figure out. The day traders play their shit and people get out every day but this just shows solid growth. Everyone freaking out or trying to play üåà üêª on NIO is wasting their time. We all know it‚Äôs going up even more next week so just save the scare tactics

Yeah over 2 years. Tesla is 387 billion for selling 500 000 over 10 years and constantly lying/being a fraudulent company. Whats your point?
The market hasn't reacted to any of this yet. $AZN is moving higher though.
This guy is shifty as fuck....
Not really, no way would I take one of the mRNA vaccine, look it up

Nice bro keep it rolling. I made a pretty penny on Tesla and Apple calls last week too
Fuck.   


I just need the vaccine and optimism shit to stop so the markets can finally tank and I can go all in on SPY calls to the recovery again.  


States are closing again, cases are higher than ever, talks of impending housing crash, even when everyone is vaccinated so many people are out of jobs, a president that won't give up his position.  


Why the shit won't it go down.
NVDA earnings next week . Keep tech out of your mouth .

Half of America doesn't want the vaccine, as shown by the election results
20,000 cars is a lions share of the Chinese car market? Do you know how many Chinese there are, and follow up question. Are you retarded? If they own 30% they‚Äôll be fine. Sure they‚Äôll also be fine if they own 40% 90% or 100%. If your due diligence is an ‚Äúif statement‚Äù you‚Äôre dumb.

I really like the wheel strat, and i could probably make around the same doing it on AMD for example. but id have to do more research in delta, and stocks with good IV
Though I did just get a rapid test done about 30 minutes ago and the doctor told me the rapid tests give a lot of false negatives, but false positives are much more rare.
Really though Nio was due for a correction. regardless if Andy said anything and look. Only down 7percent.  That‚Äôs alright.

You can tell everyone that talks in these pressers has been warned that if they say something that hurts the economy they are gone. Every one of them talks in such vague terms about delivery dates and pumps up these other "potential" vaccines as if they are coming before christmas. Reality is that none of these will have wide distribution until at least April and that's coming direct from donald pump
The start of the zombie apocalypse.
It dropped to 40 and then recovered back to 44 almost immediately...calm down brotha, still DUMB up for the year
Right after that October vaccine he was talking about in september

Lmao wtf kind of question is that dude. Nio is going o at least 35 before a bounce. I think it‚Äôs there at warning and plummets to $28
Sad and pathetic he's going out like a loser like this. All he had to do to keep his dignity was admit defeat like a man. He would of at least gone out with some respect. The GOP didn't even do so bad in the rest of election besides losing Prez.
Why didn't they bring someone from Pfizer to this meeting?

>NIO is not the collective future of EV lol it‚Äôs one company

The reason your investing is in expectation they have the lions share in the largest car market in the world. If they own 30% of china's EV market they could be selling over 2 million cars a year in China alone. This is a lot.

Can't wait for a vaccine that half the country won't take
Now December
ok..,. so the shit is ready, but lets get a large portion of the population to test the shit out.. uh, yeah, no thanks.  this has been where logic breaks from the narrative..  sure, it's getting 'done' in record time, but the corners that are being cut are the fucking TESTING of it

Don‚Äôt stress about NIO guys all the bagholders and quitters got out already if they were going to get out today was the day. We go back up next week and over time we go up bit by bit every week

Why do you pump warp speed before you actually distribute anything to citizens?
Godspeed retad
**cough** we don‚Äôt have a vaccine....
I‚Äôm pretty sure Waymo is ahead of Tesla on autonomous data. Sure Tesla has hundreds of thousands of cars on the road but they‚Äôre mostly driving normally. The amount of data from that is important but not necessarily a game changer.
It dropped so much today there‚Äôs honestly no way that happens. Everyone who got out already did.
Haven't seen or heard from my gf for 3 days. I should probably try to find her
This truly feels like a goodbye speech. Sad.
why isnt what trump saying bullish ?

Godamn, hopefully
Sure but the laughs used to come from posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cca4bh/stock_tank) instead of 20 "lel NIO go brrrr" posts

Oh there are 6 vaccine candidates? Wow i had no clue. What a waste of time
Is this cope?

Thought it was just my screen. The election really took a toll on him. Too busy to buy hair dye.

I think you don‚Äôt understand how autonomous driving works. Data, data, data.  Tesla has a multi year head start with more vehicles on the roads than any other company, by a long shot.  In California their cars are already capable of fully autonomous driving from highway on ramp to exit, mainly due to the amount of data they have on those roads.

Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt own, and have never owned TSLA.  But I do have a degree in comp sci engineering, and my current work is focused on AI

So what exactly did mango say except "fuck NY"?
I‚Äôm gonna name my first child ‚ÄúOperation Warp Speed‚Äù
Market is safe, Trump got the silver/white hair today and his face looking tame too.

Only gets crazy when he puts on the mango.
Mango, you are alright in my book, but for fucks sake just concede already and end the clown show.
After approval in April lol
Only states that comply will get the vaxx - fair and square
No way - but given the dude is 100% politics I figured he would be worried about the optics.
Bruh
People trying some daytrading
My stocks started falling during Mango‚Äôs speech.

Puts on Mango
Hair is white - Bears delight
Mike Pence is alive?
I think it was more just he mentions it when it hits an ath or breaks a 30 day moving avg which typically sells off.
True.
lol I think my calls are fucked o
Gap up 20%
coming up after this guy, followed by Goya CEO
So trump is saying that we'll start vaccinating folks in a matter of weeks.
Media don‚Äôt get to decide who wins. 

By tradition they just project the winner. They don‚Äôt certify.
Nothing to do but trade options, bulls and bears both dead
oh yay, they found some people to come up and rub the emperors nuts
Did Trump really fire a real scientist for this clown
Have you seen how much merch Trump supporters buy? Its literally free money lol he will never stop campaigning.

More covid deaths = more stimulus.
Wow that‚Äôs the closest to admitting defeat we‚Äôre going to hear

Their paid recommendations supposedly return 2-5x market returns. I'm guessing there's some fucky math involved in getting to that conclusion, though.
Took an IQ test my result was 65, should i just castrante myself?
Mango just called the top!!
HAHAH HE PUMPED THE MARKET GET READY TO DUMP
Tried googling it but only found images of some kind of robot vacuum cleaner. Am I spelling it wrong?

This is the only way, they will never understand
I don't even want the vaccine after they fucked my tech positions
It's usually self made millionaires and billionaires who live like they are on welfare working at Wendy's. Meanwhile, all the average people are out there spending the money they don't have with the intent to pumping the market for us :) And the same average people blame the system lol

HE MENTIONED STOCKS. SELL SELL SELL
Damn red Monday confirmed
Sounds like my girlfriend evaluating my dingaling on growth potential. Just because it goes from 1/2 inch to 6 doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bigger than an a 5 going to an 8.

Bought calls at all time highs and at HOD... Still made over 100% on my calls lmao

I know, but one day profit will easily disappear overnight and those kind of gains aren't exactly what goes viral around here. If you can repeat that to the end of the week (and you probably won't), then you'll be a legend.
Only 5,000 Nio comments? I thought it was like a million.

You guys understand he said the *general population* by April and it‚Äôs rolling out before then right
DD? or just a meme? Because a stock that bleeds a percent a week for the last few months isn't just going to pop because Ghyna.
DUDES ROCK
this company seems pretty innovative and way ahead of it's competition when it comes to body cameras. This is one of those plays that WSB will ignore, while we quietly make easy money
Half the country won't even need a vaccine. Puts on PFE.

Posted about this this morning and got downvoted to oblivion on my post. These dipshits will chase NIO all day to all time highs only for it to dump, but you mention a stock on the launch pad ready to rock and no one even cares. Funny how that works. Oh well, I‚Äôll continue loading calls at these levels. End of month this will pop off
They have enough remdesivir to treat 800k people. In the meantime, over 160 million people voted in the election. Does 800k seem enough to you, Mango?

Yes? Ok

now the market has the whole weekend to digest and make up some more shit about all news being bullish

BA up 6% yep life is back to normal all right
HYG puts Dec Jan......
Where‚Äôs my boy regeneron?!
All got in on the dip let‚Äôs get to tendie land next week
When‚Äôs your NIO expiry? Today was a very obvious sell of due to its irrational momentum over the past few weeks. 

A perfect time to buy into NIO for most people, if you‚Äôre sitting on calls you should be good until at least Mon-Tue next week. 

With that being said, keep in mind if you keep YOLOing shit you‚Äôll lose it eventually.
Come on Donnie, say CROX is partnering with the US military to hand out the vaccine
SPACEX LAUNCH SUNDAY WITH HUMANS üöÄüöÄüöÄ

TSLA WILL GO TO MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄ
If Trump gives 9 out of 10 of his family members that vaccine, one of them could die. He thinks it‚Äôs excellent nonetheless
aaaaaahhhhhhhhjjjhhhhhhhhhh
Meme city
Can we just take a moment to thank pfizer for waiting to announce the vaccine after the election.
cuomo said he doesnt want it not trump saying he cant have it
Then fucking make it bro? Sounds like a solid business idea to me.
I just made $1500 on it today on cheap calls I bought 3 days ago. Sold them before the drop and weekend. Milk the cow....buy the rumor and sell the news...use whatever works for you
Yeah dude he's barely alive rn

True, this stock fucking sucks

Hahaha I‚Äôm going to miss having a President that rubs any good thing that happened in the oppositions face and constantly throws shade others
Forgot to dye it this morning
You're funny.

Lol Donnie is only going to deliver the vaccine to states he got electoral votes from
Bullish pattern today but watch for head and shoulders bear
Plot twist- its theta gang gonna sell you dumbasses calls with IV thru the roof

I love fact checks they‚Äôre so biased it isn‚Äôt even funny
The vaccine will be available immediately...in April
Imagine the money they save without needing to buy a fourth wheel tho /s
As soon as April means by end of summer earliest. Rotate back to Tech it is.
algorithms exist is why
Sorry NYC NO SOUP FOR YOU
You YOLOed? Ok, just note it could have just as easily gone the other way.
Ha, who remembers tankers DD ?
I hope so
These people harassing Trump on twitter should seriously be institutionalized.

Well played! Back up we go
This is a long way from the electric daily April pressers
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time they can have their golden years‚Äù. This man is a walking bag of dust lol
Lmao he‚Äôs not give the vaccine to NY
I'm feeling rather bullish today so probably not.
Puts on NY

Not gonna lie I‚Äôm gonna miss the Trump disses
Nope
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is going to host press conferences lmao
Why not both? ü¶ò
Just the tip
So if the call you sell expires worthless the only difference you‚Äôd see is the premium added to your cash balance? Kind of a bummer, I wanted to try to get my cost basis in the negative
APRIL.  With 150,000 cases a day now. F
I‚Äôve been holding SOLO for 2+ months and sold last week and got into this NIO shit
FVAC hit to $14 today. Still one last chance to get in on monday before the ticker changes to MP on Tuesday and that shit MOONS.
nope. actually i think you can still trade but no more day trading.
Yo, this shit is gonna open at 345
Dude wrote a book while people were dying - not surprised
On Monday morning we are going to get a wave of downvotes. Just exactly what happened with nio today. Lol

Had major fomo this morning and bought 100 shares to sell covered calls on.  Feelsbadman
i come from oklahoma trailer trash, like imagine grapes of wrath if they stayed in OK, ok thats my paternal great grandparents. Mother fuckers grew in great depression, literally starved (in that area all of the game had been hunted to Extinction), got forclosed, had to live in a tent by the river where everyone got malaria, etc

great gramps mines coal, pays his way though his phd in education, turns around and does the same for his wife, they teach school till they retire, living poor as fuck, saving and buying blue chip. THEN THEY RETIRED AND COLLECT A PENSION FOR LONGER THAN THEY WORKED.

Died with 2.2 million dollars, never even traveled to see their great grandkids because it was too expensive. I caught them eating rotten ( not expired) but rotten food several times, this was while staying with my software engineer uncle in his fucking mansion, they could have eaten fucking quail and filet minon, nah they had discount flank steak with discount lysteria cantaloupe cuz its 30cents off.

thats why i hate the aarp, fuck old people, fuck social security

They have had 6 and a half decades to get their shit together, during the most prosperous time in human history. If you see an old person who is poor, they are really fucking stupid.

Lol literally zero
For those wondering my mango hair is white and he sounds so depressed... It's stress. The mental shock of losing was too much for him to handle. He was so convinced he would win that his body/brain took a major hit when he realized he lost... Bigly.
That‚Äôs what I thought . . .
Sounds like that Citron report.
PLTR is one of them.  Eat a dick.

Jack Ma is no longer on the board of BABA. This may be true of Ant, but they are not a huge percentage of BABA‚Äôs market cap. I think the drop is overblown and a good buying opportunity. There are always risks to Chinese stocks but for the most part this is reflected in their proving multiples which are generally lower than comparable US companies. China can implement regulations, but I see BABA long outlasting these. When bad Chinese news comes out US investors always panic which creates good entry points.
Trump is calling this the best test ever while Elon Musk is on Twitter calling the test terrible
Fuck Cuomo I love the call out lmao
LOL this dipshit is literally threatening to withhold vaccine to NY because of Cuomo
Reminds me of the pen15 shaped cars from goldmember
90% or more lmao
Good
Donnie hesitated saying he will sign off the vaccine early next year to "near future"
Oh come on April is so far away these have to be good for my puts
Same here, then I bought back in at the dip
Thanks big man
Elon took a rapid test which has more false negatives than false positives. He‚Äôs  a dumbass.
we need a pullback and this presser is nonsense

Andrew Left, can't stand the guy. Banned from trading for 5 years due to false reports and manipulation of Hong Kong markets. Notorious for making claims about Chinese companies to profit off their declines. Even if NIO may be overvalued, he definitely is the gayest of all bears
>ad I bought more calls right at open

Tits up = dead, OP just doesn't know what it means XD

No, Bears. There will be no Golden Years for you.

Are there penalty‚Äôs/ fees?
WOH WTF NY
As someone with pure stay at home stocks holding over the weekend I feel you
Didn't sell my calls, but I have 12/18 calls that I bought at 38.

Still sucks though. I was up 30% on the day this morning, and at one point was down 30% on the day. Ended the day down 16%. What a rollercoaster. Wish I had sold when I heard about the report, which was about 52. I could have bought in at 40ish and saved myself a lot of grief.
Finally, someone on here that knows how to sell and actually lock-in gains.  Congrats.
12/4 $15c and 12/24 $15.5c hoping it moons after this weekend to unload my 12/4 calls and take a longer position. Prevailing sentiment is that this will be a boomer but idk I‚Äôm a fucking retard
Like how you took zero profits while up 8K. I don‚Äôt have those balls
He always talks like this when he's reading off a prompt/paper and not ad-libbing like at his rallies.
lmao he said 1 year so next summer

or april just now lmao
They were also short GSX, a known scam, but everyone who shorted it earlier this year is now dead.

Pretty bad track record but you can make serious bank if they release a report on lottery Friday.

Bet your fucking ass they had 1000s of FD puts.
Went all in on 11/20 SOLO puts near end of day in an emotional retarded play. Thoughts?

Welcome to the better club. You won't win every time, and you won't see major overnight gains, but it will treat you right in the longer run.
they can buyback 100M shares which is huge considering how much of it is being shorted

After that its waiting on earnings
Not to be a dick but how are those nio calls doing ? üòÇ

Let's be frank, I owe some PLTR and want them to moon, but too many people are successfully diamond handing and buying calls (imo based on the sub sentiment).

If yall diamond scalepers get more successful, MM ain't gonna pump more money into the stock. Likewise, if too many people buy calls, MM ain't gonna pump to the call price to let you win. 

The house will always want to win and I don't have a good sentiment of it mooning given all the lucky diamond handers and call holders.
Smart money stays the fuck away from parabolic stocks. Big gains mean big losses eventually

Did you sell?
Is theta going to destroy the 11/20 calls?
Five times faster. Nobody could believe it actually.

Gotta get as much as we can out of these presses. Best comedy shows ever.


Sleepy joe is gon do just that when he gets on these presses. Put us all to sleep. Unless his brain starts farting and saying crazy shit.
dont sell at a loss, just wait for it to bounce back if its a decent company
Yes
PLTR TO 50 EOY. Im gonna suck Alex Karp good and hard through his jorts
Not the company it‚Äôs because of the volume. Where was this guy 6 months ago? He did it now because over 300mil shares being traded.

Lol he didn‚Äôt dye his hair
With all the negativitiy around, SPY puts would make sense, but as it is 2020, calls would be the only right choice, but i went one step further and out smarteteted year 2020, as inverse logical move has been the theme, SO FAR, so now i decided to inverse the inversed move, so i bought weekly puts instead. SPY352p will print, feeling confident.
I need trump to say ‚ÄúI will never concede this presidency. Joe Biden will be president over my dead body‚Äù

I opened another 41c at today's low so let's hope it bounces back.

Mango's conference is gonna be 30 mins advertising Goya and MyPillow. Ivanka will be showcasing the items. There'd be a number at the bottom of the screen to dial and purchase.

Anyone think GME prices blew it's load over the new xbox/playstation, Microsoft deal and debt prepayment? Like that's it, gamestop has no more tricks in its bag and back to penny stock ville.
I was high idk about shorting.
I mean the same rules can apply to options too. I like to buy options 2 month out minimum on significant dips. And usually no more than like 5% of portfolio at a time. If I‚Äôm early, and it dips more, I add more.

If it goes up and I miraculously timed the bottom, great! Sell baby. 

Weekly plays are just a great way to lose money.  I‚Äôve hit a few lottos sure, but way too many losers for it to work.
Is it safe to say that purchasing a dated put on a stock like this one is virtually risk free?
Gonna guess this press conference is going to be 2 percent BIGLIEST vaccine talk, 98 percent voter fraud conspiracy stolen election grievance airing.
Newbie explain???
He looks better grey
1.95 billion to PFE? Lol?
Puts on pfizer they made a mistake!
Because it's so laughable that it isn't worth validating by putting a lot of energy into arguing against what he said. "Science" never had some overwhelming consensus that the Earth was the center of the universe. The Church did.

Plus, the idea that any random idiot can "challenge science" is moronic. Science is constantly evolving and getting better, but you know who the people behind that are? Fucking scientists, idiot.
1.45 million billion dollars?
See, I tried to make a post saying the exact same thing, but I called the mods retards & talked about their families, and they removed it. Smh, censorship at its finest
Just Google their vehicle and look at it lol nobody ever spending money for that
1.95 million billion dollars wow!
Fundamentally, yes they are. However, UPS has new Gung ho CEO who is doing very nicely since taking over.
Here we go. He clearly didn‚Äôt write these words here at the beginning. Just waiting for the freestyle portion  of the evening.

Holy shit. Sold my Nio put right at the bottom. It went back up after 2:40 pm. Great day for me
Yeah I got a real weird feeling at 53 and sold my shares at 50.5, glad I did. Something was off. Earnings will really affirm if they have legs for the future too

WUT! Your positions are down? GTFO until you sell.
My positions are regularly bouncing up and down 1, 2, 3, 5k back and forth.  Pick carefully, don't overload your account (meaning too many positions that will trash you if they ALL decide to drop), and trust your choices. Don't feel good about your picks? Shouldn't have made them, get out quick.

Just curious why you didn‚Äôt just sell cash secured puts?
God I‚Äôm gunna be so wet for that NIO 70 ER day omfggggg so wet
Op these guys are dicks and don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. You basically opened up 30 call credit spreads to try and take profits. What you should have done is opened up 15 call credit spreads and 15 call debit spreads so regardless of direction, the p/l would balance out more and you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about a significant loss/gain. For example, you‚Äôd sell 15 17.5 calls and 15 22.5 calls (same width apart). If you‚Äôre more bearish you could make a higher ratio of call credit spreads or if you‚Äôre more bullish, higher ratio of debit spreads. Good luck

Good point.  Could also argue that the vaccine is uncertain to an extent still and Corona still going wild; with the current President looking to undercut the election.  

I agree with you but also could argue a more bearish side.  Interesting nonetheless.

Yeah but I feel that intel is a little more undervalued now. A lot of the news about apple using their own chips and Intel's manufacturing delays have really already been baked in to the price it's at now.

You don‚Äôt even know how to read an options position, how are you going to tell this guy what to do? And if you understood the picture you‚Äôd see he did sell options against the contracts he bought.
I sold a 1/21 BABA 330/300/300/270 iron butterfly today because I think many people are buying 1/21 300c. I think we slowly melt up but fail to hold over 300 until after January options expire worthless.

We talking Xpeng huh?
Pound for pound latest president ever
Almost everyone here bought puts for the weekend.
NIO got parked at a market cap of 60.**69** billion
Bought more LEAPS today lets goo
Or because you sold puts and bought calls because monday train will be nice, provided our dear president trump doesn‚Äôt fcuk it up somehow.
This will print
Stop buying high and selling low. Wait for something to be low, then buy and sell when it goes higher. Sure it may not be 10bagger but if you build up some profits. Can do small plays on house money that could become 10baggers.
Are these launches happening (suppose to be happening) in New Mexico???

I‚Äôve been holding, I‚Äôm up 2,000% on my 10c jan21
How many of you didn't sell your NIO calls this morning? I bought puts at the top but didn't hold them long enough. Could have made a lot more.
Genius
Combined with the -20 years from Regeneron, he‚Äôs basically like 11 years old at this point.

Lmao, capital?

What‚Äôs your timeline? Monday = maybe fuk. Friday = ITM bigly.
My buddies and I made money strangling NIO like the little bitch it is. We made profit on every single trade since last week, its been wild.
I am on 200% IV : )
Imagine being so retarded you see SPX base above 3500 for the entire week and decide you should keep buying puts? I don't understand you dumbasses at all.
I would of been sold to hold on to something, but im PDT'd so i cant do shit. lol but well see how things turn out next week
Bad week for me. Lost about 800.
Trump going to announce a blanket ban of all things Chinese just to fuck up the market.
Sure go ahead and be happy with 5% gains on a 200k portfolio, but I can‚Äôt stand the ppl with 5k portfolios, which is probably most of his audience, that think they‚Äôll acc make money following his advice and think they got it all figured out.
If you have 2.5M why play with options. Just go long.
Yaayyy weekend thread now we can talk about other shit.

I got a philosophy essay due at 11:59 and still haven‚Äôt even started it. I‚Äôm too busy betting on second division soccer games. Honestly today is a good day. Made a cool 200 with only 15 bucks
What brokerage gives you the ability to withdraw the unsettled funds the same day?
Ballsy
Price floor is 40. Morgan Stanley will come in with the big guns.
That‚Äôs when the timeline split. Look back and see how evident this is.
gonna pee myself if spy gaps up good bye college tuition
But uhm.. sir.. you forget that there's ppl like me that bought at 53 today, kinda unfair that there's a guy with influence that publishes stuff for the sole purpose to drag something down and made profits for himself imho
Why bet on Intel?  x86 architecture is on the way out with the way that arm is performing lately.  Should sell it and buy calls on TMSC.  They manufacture Apple's arm based processors.  The latest m1 chip in the new macbook air is incredibly fast and that is without a fan.  It beats the latest macbook pro 16" with an intel processor with a low power fanless processor.
Absolutely. Good luck to us lmao
People are so fucking retarded buying above the offer price of the airline.

I don't give feet pics to weebs
Literally watched it try and make up it's mind for 20 min
Puts on Cheetos
Look at their last filing. The company makes no profit and had no reason it should be at it's current valuation.
Because every time NIO has a shit day or two it moons for the next week. People have been saying that NIO is overvalued and that the bubble is gonna pop since it was 10 dollars. These are the same  üåàüêª‚Äôs saying Tesla was overvalued at 400 dollars presplit. EV‚Äôs are the future and anyone telling you to sell because of 1 red day hates money.
Fucking ü§° living three days behind

tech selloff kind of already happened, I don‚Äôt think it will be as bad as monday if it sells off again. But also I know nothing
Net green 3.2k today. Did have a 2k loss early from a Li call that I bought at 9:35 and sold for a loss at 10:02 (got lucky).
Incorrect as usual.
NIO drill another 10% on monday and then another 10% after earnings 

WSB truly ruins everything it touches
Good luck
Totally... Just like me fellow ü§°
Did someone say tendies????
Watch my SPY calls be Thanos snapped in a blink

-2k
All the extra chromosomes are on today. I love it
It's been over 4 years since Harambe was murdered in cold blood, look whats happened since then... SMH
Its the only way to make their short trades work. Buy puts, then push out your "research" that you found a stock that sucks and watch as everyone tries to market sell before everyone else does. Anyway it was bound to happen for some reason or other you can't go straight up forever on speculation that Nio will be the whole chinese economy in 5 years
I'm guessing trump will just re-iterate what we already know about operation warp speed.
Oof. Sorry man.
Lmaooo
me 2 brother. got wrecked by FSLY volatility this week.
I'm sure your trades are amazing! you definitely get to be the arbiter of good vs bad trades homie
Kinda want to buy Affirm pre-IPO stock. Trading at $25 on private exchanges. That it like 1/4 what Afterpay is trading at.
ZM thoughts?
Bought at IPO and have been steadily buying more
>People are too unstable 

FTFY
The sell off planned is but timing news to coincide with the sell off at a high..
Fuck how do people rely on that? Makes me think that this dip was not Citron and was a mix of other things.
Donnie canceled conference, go home bois
Or it's your shitty internet connection.
Say goodnight to the orange guy cause it‚Äôs the last time you ever gonna see a man this orange
Hope so
They bouta punch a wall for not buying in
Gonna need dem pics now boi

I sold for a tidy profit and I‚Äôm waiting until after earnings to buy back in. Meme stocks drop after earnings, it‚Äôs basically a fiduciary law at this point.

Purchased NIO 11/20 $45c EOD like an idiot. Really hope I don‚Äôt regret this Monday.
Of course. I have zero recovery stonks/calls.
What if you stop loss sold and rebought at the same sale price??
Sold all my NIO stonks at 45.1 with a 13% profit. No regrets. Shits too unstable if one shitty article by a company with a terrible rep can make them drop -14% in a day.
Atta guy. I should have sold my shares this morning but I bought a put to cover them so I ain't sweatin' at all.
Operation ‚Äúon time is when I get there‚Äù........
Donny thinking if he's *really* late by the time he comes out it'll be the end of Biden's term already & they'll let him stay
Mango gonna announce he got the vaccine and he feels better than he has in 40 years.
You‚Äôre proving it. You shouted down the heresy with zero criticism of substance. Nice dogma
Cause im about to buy it
Chwy ostk amzn atvi
thank god
BAN
Mango: I'm the one who created the vaccine for the hoax virus. Not the stupid scientists or doctors. Me.

Also Mango: I've instructed both the DEA and Justice Dept. to move forward with sweeping enforcement of federal legal standards regarding the most dangerous threat to our national security and public health... the adult/medical use of marijuana.
I know. What I meant was, it's safe to buy puts lol
UPDATE: I suck at trading.
I'm finally one of you guys now.
yes
I was trying to get spy puts with expiry today but broker (Schwab) kept glitching and wasn‚Äôt allowing me to buy. I guess there are instances when we should be thankful for those moments ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

i'm half year leaps on it but if you want quick bucks play a week or two after the conference for 50c, good news = tendies
NIO bears stomping their way down to the soup kitchen
He's supposed to talk about the vaccine but I'm guessing he's gonna talk about rigged elections, if not now soon. There's so many ways to contest an election is insane and the electors don't vote until the 14th.
Your next.
He probably gets in and out. I don't know why anyone listens to his word like gospel.
Err no
Same boat here but at same time I am not going to die waiting 3 months to get one either.  Really wish there was a legit way to just waitlist one.

Jacked to the tits on SPY calls expiring Monday! Can't wait for that pump
Anyone paying attention to SPY‚Äôs bollinger bands on a weekly timeframe. Extremely unusual for it to jump outside and close at the top of the bands
Goodluck. Usually when alot of wsb retards go in on the same trade is a bad sign.

Proud to be a valiant knight of PLTR
Damn how much of a clown you gotta be to continuously post politics and then wonder why Mango is still in office. I have people on my fb feed that were legitimately confused as to why Biden isn't pushing a stimulus bill through right now. Murica's future may be fucked with these lowIQ idiots having such a loud voice. I blame Jerome Powell.
I honestly think its coming. With PA saying fuckk off
He was buying up MRNA and vaccine shit so he can pump it

listen here autists that missed out NIO. I had 225 shares. I then sold at a covered call at 2 dollars thinking "hey lemme gamble the premium". lost the premium because I'm a dumbass. Could've had bought more or bought back the covered call. But no. I'm autistic and could've sat on 8k profit instead of 1k.

Im not proud of it but i used a deposit that wouldn't clear to buy calls at -14% today... I ended the day profiting $800 off that trade and closed it out at 3:59.   I don't know what this will look like come Monday i needed to make the play.

So you‚Äôre going to pay someone 2.30 for a call that is 50% otm, and $100 for one that is 100% otm? I‚Äôll go ahead and buy the stock at $14 and not worry about it going up or down.

Holy shit you're right.  Thought you were full of it since it got over 360 a while ago.  But as far as a close that is crazy.

Cuz you bought the top with all of your buying power? Did you sell? Or buy 0dte with no day trades left?
Rule #1 of selling puts according to a hedge fund options manager I listen to: don‚Äôt sell puts unless you‚Äôre trying to buy a specific stock at a certain price and get paid for it. Ie you like Costco at $350 but not $370, so you sell a $350p for expiration next week. You get paid a few dollars to sell the put and possibly buy those stock at a marked discount if the economy falls as much as you thought it would(3%in Costco/Walmart would be a lot).

It truly shows how retarted people are in here when I saw about 50 posts about people getting "killed by NIO" today, a stock up 105% in the past month.

Hmmmm I don‚Äôt agree with this at all they also sold at $7 lol
imagine not buying the dip on $nio today ^(couldnt be me)
Making money is easy. All you do is buy a shit ton of calls in a company. Then buy 1 put afterwards that's near identical from the same company. That way when the market inverses your most recent purchase of the put, you'll actually be gaining money on all your calls.

Just general anticipation for vaccine news that will kill the stock probably.

Lot of reason to move money out of tech and back into other companies that stand to gain a ton from a vaccine, gotta liquidate the positions somewhere and Zoom's been often considered in this sub as the most overbought through the tech run.
im in a similar but smaller boat, one of the bigger oofs in my 'folio history but just gotta learn to stomach it

Winners: HD earnings calls, DKNG 0DTE puts at peak of day. 

Losers: SPY 0DTE Puts, MRNA strangle

Going to be a winner: SOLO puts, unless NIO buys them.
so hes the guy that always sells me those shitty cars
I hope everyone here continues making money (so long as your trade isn‚Äôt the opposite of mine). 

I have a lot of 2021 calls so part of me doesn‚Äôt want to sell yet. Similarly, i don‚Äôt want to be guessing each day if covid is gonna hit the market or not. 

I think election uncertainty going away will provide us some tailwinds
Airline calls or puts??
Commented on the wrong thing, what do you mean 245?  545?
I don‚Äôt disagree. Just feels like it‚Äôs gonna go way back up.

I died like 3 times today. Bought nio puts at am then calls when it hit -7%
We reached solid bottom today. It had a crazy run so we were due for a pull back. Double whammy with the short report. Filled all resistance. This is solid bottom setting up for next week‚Äôs ER and related runs.
at least ‚úäüí∞
For real I picked up some spy 11/16 $364p and I'm just glad I didn't buy a lower strike. At least I won't lose it all. Hopefully.

Hopefully Mango shows some maturity and accepts defeat gracefully and leaves us with one last vaccine pump.  Take SPY to 400 Mango.
bought some calls for this morning looks like it'l hit 10$ probaly next week

wtf, are you okay?
I'm bummed there isn't more supply. Will my msft calls be safe? Jk

Why you would buy these stupid fucking consoles instead of msft stonk is beyond me.
Horrible week. Never recovered from bloody Monday and aftershock Tuesday. Huge losses.
245?!?
Why won't more people get technical education to become electricians, plumbers...etc when those jobs pay way more than college educated jobs and have much better job security?
Oooh boy, I'm guessing Trump is about to fuck your SPY calls for next week in about 15 minutes.
go for FSR bro
i sold off 8 contracts out of 10x 54c 11/20  Just to minimize my losses.

Still have 10x 10x 47c 11/20 remaining.
Should drop just on fundamentals
Sold some NIO, XPEV shares for gains and dump them into CHIQ. It's not exciting but it's a decent way to get into Chinese consumer market.
As if we let NIO shit the bed on some lemon reporting lemon news. Made a similar claim about Tesla and went back on his word. Absolute joke
Airbnb is going to pop huge. There is just simply too much demand and too many participants in the market right now looking for new growth

Take a second once in a while to think ahead a move or two, like in chess. You might not be disingenuous but surely logically lazy.

If we could shut down to get rid of the flu, we absolutely **should** and **would**. The problem is that the flu mutates fast and is all around the world so shutting things down will not work because it'll be brought back from other countries.

Shutting things down **for COVID** **would work** because it's just delaying mass mortality while we develop a vaccine. If it was found that a vaccine is not possible/can't work then of course shutting things down would become pointless.
Your
When exactly did you buy
NIO started at $41.5 Monday and ended at $45.5 today.. So, !
A 50% runup in 5 days?

Shit need to consolidate eventually bruh.
Fuck 4x spy 358 puts didn't get filled, only one got filled.
Best sleep this weekend of my life knowing that I‚Äôm about to print out my fucking ass next week.

Fomo. We close at an ath next destination is 400. Nah dumb money is rushing in thinking the vaccines is a done deal and we will only go up from here. A few day of deep red and the panic will set in.
Nothing wrong with that. You confirmed that NIO was going to stay above resistance and not keep dumping. It might not be technically an ideal entry, but you can't see into the future.
Holy shit! Nice work dude!!!
holy shit you're gonna be so rich next week
It will go to 35
yes and no, 5yr forward looking period is hazy for all tech now

It depends how rapid it looks Monday, if it starts zooming after 9:30, I‚Äôll flip a call or two maybe, I‚Äôll wait till after earnings for shares most likely

How do I tell if I made money this week?
Hey look its a dumbass
NO

If it was even remotely true, there would be people talking about it and click bait articles online mentioning how it's going to ruin retail trader's bank accounts even more.
Nope I just have a watch list of about 30 stocks in two or three themes that I have been watching since March and I set level alerts. When something gets offsides to the downside I buy it and when it gets offsides to the upside I sell it. I use a combo of stock and options depending on the price of volatility. So far I have mostly just sold a bit too soon I only buy stocks at the bottom of their ranges so I dont really mind if I get stuck holding them.

For example I bought LUV for (price off top of head) 37 and sold it for 46 in about two weeks. This same trade has reoccured several times albiet the time period was a lot longer previously.
hoping yall stfu about NIO for the weekend so we know what's winning, covid cases or potential vaccine rumours
Why is Mango still the president??!
Now or when?
why, does theta eat at it every sec or somn? what if they moon? isnt their like so little iv on 0dte or somn

I cant read communist
Of course

Just hope people don't use dumb logic and think since NIO ran from under $10 to $50, SOLO is cheap because it's still under $10!
Nahh.. Tomorrow night
XLE üöÄüöÄ- it‚Äôs about time! With no place to make money except equities - and given XLE pays 13% dividend - I think there‚Äôll be a rotation here.  Energy isn‚Äôt going anywhere for decades.  I‚Äôm heavily weighted in XLE and also own some XOM, OKE & HP.
I mean. In 1-2 years def good play. Gonna shed a lot more in the short term tho
nio either going back to 50 or back down to 41 either way spooky if you're playing options through weekend

I don't trust myself to do that kind of trading half the time. Either you miss the dip and buy too high, or you get a bad entry on IV pop and don't make a solid day trade.

Bought NIO calls and SPY puts at close
Legit üëç
Positions over the weekend:

PLTR 18c 11/27
PLTR 20c 1/2023
NIO 50c 11/20
Couple long dated 7.5c on SOLO
SPY 370c 11/13(lottery ticket bet again)

Cmonnnn
i sold those to you lol, they might not
Got 15 12/18 SPY 290P at close, see you fuckers Monday.
Where is the orange man?
Last two months of year have always been bullish.  Boomer FOMO
Who's getting paid Friday/Monday and getting ready to pump the markets?

Let's fucking go, xpev, nio and li to the moon. 

These Chinese girls are ready for the gang bang.
Will hit 370 next week, buy calls first thing Monday
I sold all my NIO shares, bought in at 40, sold them at 43 after watching it sink from 54 this morning. I only had 200. I took a stress nap right after.

I literally had a dream that i woke up and NIO was at $7/share again and i kept refreshing the page and it jumped up to $10/share within 2 page refreshes because everyone was chipping back in. I bought 500 shares at $13/share after the next page refresh then i woke back up.......
Honestly the premiums on BABA were insane on Tuesday. I sold a $260 put for $800 and it opened LOWER the next day and I still hadn't lost any money.
Now I am at 25% profit still even though it is basically ITM.

Did the same thing the week before, but with a weekly put, another $600 for minimal risk thanks to IV spike
I don't know why you guys don't want VIX to drop. Low VIX means cheap options. Remember last year when you could buy weeklies on SPY for 50-60 cents vs. $2-3 today?

Nailed it. All the old Germans around here maybe took the family to Hawaii when they sold 100 acres to a developer. Probably didn't even like it, and wore jeans and work boots to the beach. Other than that, same clothes, same boots, same tavern. You'd never know.
with the way the market has been on mondays, you might not even be. just gotta have a real butthole tensed weekend until you find out monday
Feels a lot like that SA article about ENPH that tanked it about 10% to the $39 range, currently sitting at about $100
alright retards, cough up the NIO loss porn

Wtf would have thought GE would breakout like this?  RIP my puts.  F u larry culp

Fuck, I dumped my NIO leaps for a 99% loss today :(
Lol lucky you .
11/20 17c

I‚Äôll roll them into BABA leaps if it keeps on consolidating
Do y‚Äôall think NIO is going back up soon?
Well three of you are wrong
Monday will either by -1200 or +1200 for the DOW no inbetween
Dreams are broken again bears üêª
I made lots of money today
Seriously regretting not loading up with more gay bear shit for the weekend. I was super busy all day and then suddenly realized the market was closing in 10 minutes and I had to make some plays fast so I just got SPY puts. Wish I had thought to get some VXX calls too. Tons of places going back into full lockdown. Guaranteed gap down on Monday.
I‚Äôm a permabull but 30% of my portfolio is SPXS, I live on my NIO $17 calls ama

Like if you‚Äôre depressed
Not even close bitch
anyone see that -1.35% on SPY? maybe a glitch?
NIO is up 7% on the week though
BAC 28p 11/27
Gotta be vaccine news. to make himself look good
I‚Äôve never owned any Nio, but seeing so many people on here feeling like they just happened to actually get out right at the peak makes me feel like it‚Äôs going up 25% next week.
you should stop getting high so you can process more than little information. what dont you get?
See you guys on Monday when NIO opens at 55
:( sad day
NIO to $55 Monday
Think KCAC will keep pumping?
Loaded up 500 shares of PLTR üöÄ
Same I would have hit pdt if I sold and that would have fucked me. Who knows maybe I could have used the time off
Sounds good
I bought puts ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 50/50 shot

You lose
Today was fuckin BEAUTIFUL
Lucky I‚Äôm in long NIO but let me just say: FUCK YOU CITRON
This is, without a doubt, the more realistic and accurate answer
ATH Monday?
Well, this didn‚Äôt age well today.
mods are gayyyyyyy
Flash crash at open Monday?
I am here and scared
Sure, OP just dropped a decent SUV with 60,000 miles on it, and I'm the retard.

Edit: it's Monday now, and OP has upgraded his losses from a used SUV to a down payment on a 3-bedroom in Vermont with 2 acres but it needs a little work.

Buy otm leaps for all ev chip airline casino stocks
SAME THING WAS SAID ABOUT TESLA 

What's the catalyst behind thinking Nio won't sustain this price range
[deleted]
Why do you hate yourself so much?
You need help hiding the bodies?
They were not. It‚Äôs ok it was like $200 worth. Just a nice little weekend boost.
Because market makers are making money off keeping the market propped up and puts expiring worthless. It‚Äôs why it ignores news such as more lockdowns, yet uber goes higher.
Yea def wont b circuit breakers again
Who bailed them out last time? Who will next time?

Edit: i only sniff the finest imported glue
Holding BA and BABA I guess I‚Äôm a fuckin sheep
Until you üíé üñêüèª and lose you ass like I did ü§°
$600 not a lot to most people but still sucks üò¢
His articles matter because he shorted TSLA, SHOP, PTON, ZM. This is an indicator that NIO is a buy!
that's not good
Anyone else holding SPY call over the weekend or am I the only retard?
Whats your bet more lockdowns or more vaccine news?
Definitely fucked on those spy puts, someone sold you them already expired ü§£

BA 0DTE calls printed for me lol

Why you buy puts

11/20 16c boutta printttttttt
Haha thanks, just trying to survive out here
Spy 370 Monday
I got doo doo‚Äôd on and took a loss of $6k thanks to the stupid vaccine news
Or because you were smart and had stop loss orders triggered and then sell puts to either re-enter or make more money.
Never touching that trash again
How is SOLO holding up so well despite other EV stocks got fucked? I bought puts near EOD. Am I fucked?
its ok, gonna make it all back and then some
And in the meantime... Already up a whole five dollars on my UPWK call

Supposedly news is now saying they‚Äôll share anything worthwhile that he might say. So yes sounds like it.
This looks like me back in April losing almost 100k on spy puts. You will probably suffer the same fate. Good luck retard
If they were I‚Äôd be rich cuz I would have shorted NIO

Why why why do u guys buy shit like that man
Bought xpev at the top today at @51 then bought more on the dip @41 to balance it out. Am I doing this right?
Noooooo I need my allowance to buy weed and beer
God I hope not. Bought puts at close to hopefully recover from today where everything I had took a shit.
not at all
[removed]
Some gay bear boomer and they don‚Äôt
I know that but market is already up today in anticipation "buy the rumor sell the news"
Yeah, I just wish I had sold at 52 when I heard of the Citron report. I should know by now those things always cause unreasonable selling. I could have gotten back in at the bottom and had 3.5k spare cash to either put in or hold to the side. Oh well.

The biggest silver lining for me is not just that this was the bottom, but that it filled all the gaps that everyone said needed to be filled from it gapping up twice from XPEV and LI earnings. Now that those gaps have been filled and resistance confirmed at 44 (I was going to be VERY worried if it closed below 44), we can continue the moon mission in earnest without worrying as much about pull backs.

I highly, HIGHLY doubt we see a pullback to 25 like Citron claims. It smells of pure FUD.
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the way to play...
He‚Äôs still the president
I'm a Giggolo, always on the go. Every time I turn around I've got another show.
NO - USE ANOTHER BROKER BUT BE READY TO LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY
Withoht a doubt. The ‚Äúoff market‚Äù trading for these boys is wild. I was kicking myself all day for not doing a bit of intraday day trading and buying the dip after. Would of added a pretty sweet cherry on top üòÖ
Lord knows I‚Äôm going in dry for that big ass money! My profits are gonna make Citron wince more than when they sucked the fucking juice out of whatever hellbound lemon gave them their retarded ass name holy fuck!
One thing I'm not gonna miss is prez being late to his press conf

Alexa how many times was NIO mentioned?
Well like you said, they plan to adjust the total amount later anyway. If nothing else, it'll count toward a credit or tax due on your taxes at the end of the year.

I sold them on wednesday when it looked like they were gonna drop below support, silly me lol. I'm over it now though, in the process of making it back slowly and steadily. Plus, some people lost a lot more than me, and im learning that if you shoulda coulda woulda, youll end up miserable.

I think everything right now is nuts like Nio is going to hit 70 End of next week
The weird thing is, Ford actually put a lot of effort into the Chinese market. But the past few years its product management just has gone straight downhill. Losing that edge over there certainly didn‚Äôt help the stock, on top of its late arrival to EV sector. Very curious to see how Mustang and the other models pan out in America. The Detroit firms are in prove-it mode to investors,  without that full government policy support.

Sameee. Up 25% already
as someone who sold all my nio stock to take the profit real quick, to be fair this is the first bad day. We've had dips before, but nothing like this. Im definitely wary AF now but i believe in NIO long-term.
I need to stop assuming the market will behave reasonably. Bought these spreads a week ago thinking there‚Äôs no way the market just keeps surging to ATH while covid is surging to ATH and beginning to start a new wave of lockdowns. But obviously no matter what, the market now just keeps rising and surging.

Literally think i.made every wrong move today
Long term it‚Äôs great because if you have dividend reinvestment enabled it works out. But typically stock price pre dividend - dividend = stock price after dividend. And then there is recovery time where it would go back up.

This is fine
Before I got it they actually sent me a notice that my wages were adjusted and I was overpaid. Never sent them the overpayment (they basically said I didn't have to pay it back personally, they would just deduct it from future payments or my tax refund). All this like 3 months after my last claim. Then a couple days later they drop $666 into my account. Pretty fishy amount.

Weekends suck
Sorry for being late, but I have a bunch of 3/19/21 270 calls
10 x MU 11/20 60.5 C  
5 x SPCE 12/18 31 C  

My body is ready.
NIO open 60 Monday will be wild
Not a bad day at all.. seeing account ending 30$ green rather than down 800$ üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Dam looks like this guys nuts will have to stay small
Pit just locked down all schools,  if New York does that its no good.
I'd never rest easy if I had 140k in Robinhood
I regret touching NIO today
What‚Äôs your position
Robinhood is objectively shit, only retards should use it
Every day I have 30k queued up for various yolks and never pull the trigger. Feels like in saving 30k everyday
We all livin the same life here
Make sure you wake up super early for futures
This.
Gyna
Nio to be sub $5 by close next Friday. Thats 11/20 5p why, because you all are going to learn why china laughs at American investors (ptsd flashback to luckin coffee). 

Disclosure.... I play both sides and I always lose.
That moment when NIO is down 7% today??? You guys think that this is a sell off? Or do you think that it will go back up soon?
$270c 12/31

Literally can't go tits up
Weekend dow never lies
tomorrow's Saturday twat
welp i have calls. ü§û monday green
Maybe
Andrew Left reeks of jealous envious beta

The saying is so true: When youre at the top people will blow themselves up trying to take you down SMH

Article admitted he sold out of NIO at $7..
I'm not ready for it to be the weekend. I hate the weekends.
this dude jelqs
I have the ugliest Day chart today ..from up 98% at open to down -20.5% to closing up 8%

Jesus, what a day holding NIO and FSR . Can't wait to do it all over again next week. Have a good weekend boys
Then stop up voting these shitty posts(not you in particular).

I fucking hate these posts. It's obvious the person doesn't trade or only has a few dollars at risk. If you don't trade, you can't post. That should be the fucking rule.
Not to mention the price targets from various large backs like Schwab, Citi, etc. They have it in the 40-45 range, and growth stock have a tendency to rise above price targets quickly.
Ok I definitely should have closed some trades out. That was my fault for getting greedy into the weekend
NIO is the stimulus.
Did
If green Mondays are usually due to red Fridays, does a green Friday mean a super green Monday?
Link to ü•≠s press conference anybody?

Calls are fun but when you hit a put that shit is straight fire

574 MILLION FUCKING SHARES TRADED ON NIO TODAY!
I also think that. Markets are very short sighted, particularly now. Earnings are on Tuesday... after those come out and it's like the number of cars delivered has doubled or some shit people will hop right back on the wagon.
Today I learned that GM is the American guberment. 

Can you please send me some of your personal glue stash? That shit is potent.

Lets see if u regret this
Nope not at all lol
and touchdown!!! strong close for the week...
I don't know man.  Some view money as evil, some as a game as in how much I can amass.  Some want to retire rich af and in my great uncles case he wanted to better the generations he left and he did that.  Big up to those people. 

The basement dude is living as he was raised really.  I don't know what he takes joy in.  His goal was to build a big apartment building and retire off of it.

Good job my man
Nice gain!
What's more satisfying: making money or taunting gay bears?
Depending on expiry, I would be buying some $270 Nov 20 or later calls

limp dick tsla trying to go up $5 lmao....thinks its nio or something....can it hold....no...the red dildo comes out to whack it down to finish the week hahahaha
Market is retarded, as well as hedge funds that decided to start buying at the top.

Considering this level of retardation, there is no hope, the next year will be the actual end of the world.
Would TSLA drop back to $200s again if its factories close down?

Well if I had the day to do over again, I'd definitely not have flipped my ZM and AMZN positions to shorts mid-day.  All in all, gg, see you slags on Monday.

Fuuuck, I bought my 357 calls this AM for 0.40; sold them at half value due to paper hands and only recouped some of the loss back by jumping back in at a higher price.
I think it could work with positive WMT+ numbers

It's a sign. $AMZN Bout to buy the wutang album off Martin Skrillex. It is known

SPY ATH

DOW ATH

NASDAQ ... one of these days buddy
Hurts even more now hahaha
I've been trading BABA literally for like 10 years. They always have news that makes it sound like they'll go bankrupt but manage to recover each time. I think BABA will recover again. They're too important for China to actually fail. Buying shares.

NIO LOVE YOU LONG TIME!!! $100+ NEXT WEEK.

Probably a 3-4% chance my dude. Never give up on hope

You ever think about how if someone had their spouse or kids or even best friend put down their life savings on Amazon puts and then tried his hardest to kill Bezos, they could make generational wealth? Yeah me neither
place your bets boys!
anyone holding SOLO over the weekend?
thats my move. with earnings, its bound to have another: dip then zoom, or zoom then dip. are you waiting until after earnings or will you buy in on monday?
What a day!! Literally easy money on spx
vixy puts not tracking UL at all WTF?
If it does it makes it 3 times it has done this.

Look at SHOP. When he shorted, it was $50. A year later, it‚Äôs at $1000. This is good.
Got it as well. Made me go a little wild today
That's the move.

Just bought calls on FSR.

Nio is garbage propped up by the Chinese government. Nikola is garbage propped up by the American government (GM). So simply pick your garbage pile and see who wins.
Calls expiring today would be itm?
Really would like to see Citron explode in a feiry death from a Nio green Rocket Monday
I‚Äôm just going off a guess. But the markets been bullish since the 30th of October. If you look at spy we‚Äôve been going nowhere but up for around two weeks. Next week might but green all around with a few red days sprinkled in but not sure, just a tad worried
No
[deleted]
>Lol as it rebounds and gets close to $45 just before close. Bought in the dip when it was below $45 YOLO $55 next week!!!

The little Roots stayed Strong!
Look at that beautiful run up. Almost sold my calls for a loss but instead averaged down
Got the ol PDT flag, looks like I'm gonna have to go back to vanilla SPY swing trades or somethin
Probably not too bad, BABA is like the Amazon of China its not going anywhere. Besides the government shit their actual financials look great too.

500% on some pm calls feels good

0.26 at one point to 3.10 if you sold 15-20 minutes ago. They cost 0.31 when I made my comment.

Got stopped out of SPXS today. -2% on the move. Kinda sad because I wish we would pick a direction and just go - past few days have been a little sideways. As a swing trader this week has been a little meh, but last month was really fun so you win some and you lose some.
Good. Now sell it while it still has value because those become untradeable fast.

smart move he can blame the manufacturers when only 500 are shipped.

Got out of NIO and into BABA leaps
what a shit stock lol
Nice.
Nothing better than scraping 30% gains on SPY calls and puts in the last 10 minutes.

Edit: 42.5% to be exact
I just bought one as a mini yolo
Lol as it rebounds and gets close to $45 just before close. Bought in the dip when it was below $45 YOLO $55 next week!!!

And that was quality. That‚Äôs how I felt watching my calls die today.

Poor mans üèÖ
Number too inaccurate imo.
Wish i could pump my own plays like citron does, last two times they did this the stocks went 3x in a month
Fucking dick, always selling too early
Nice play! Gonna make bank next week!
F
lol look at that :) bear trap hahah
It‚Äôs wsb we‚Äôre all autists
What play?
Citron report:
1. Compare es6 to model y without even referencing es8 , ec6.
Compared tesla US sales and no reference to China sales.

2. Claims short interest 2 year low,
This retarded didnt even mention how high short interest has been in 2 weeks.

3? Didnt even reference financial data
Conclusion ;
 retard made a high school report on 1 of 3 EV companies  in a growing industry.

Still manages to scare retail investors, but looking at the institutional buys on marketbeat, charles schwab notabley bought 1.13m shares.
This game is fun, i guess ill take the hint next company he shorts, just day trade puts
Got hella puts
Aany good reason?
I think it worked, it shot up .20 after I bought in.
Eh, if NIO starting zooming back up next week, I‚Äôll jump back on. Rather just chill and see what comes of it this weekend

Every time I see someone rich working I think to myself "why does that person still work" then I realize that they became rich because they love to work and those that don't usually don't become rich.

Same with politician's, why would you go to work and get shit on by retards on the internet if you are a billionaire. It's not like you have to change your country for yourself or your kin because you are rich.
Lol
You have been lied to. The ‚Äúhoax‚Äù he was talking about, if you actually watched him speak, was about the Russia investigation, not COVID. The media cut it out of context and made it about COVID. Watch the speech. You are so far out in left field... yup we‚Äôre done. Bye
can you buy spy calls from 4:00-4:15 on Fridays?
Yeah it‚Äôs actually embarrassing
Is 11/20 a weekly?
Looking at the 20% single-day swing, that doesn‚Äôt sound as unrealistic by the end of the month.

NIO gonna anounce some good news over the weekend and gonna open $55+
Super tip.
Wtf is happening to amazon?
It doesn‚Äôt make sense but we are still gonna get crushed Monday I hate this shit
Yup $100+ next week
Too high for their short position they took out after selling their shares.
option premiums are only down like 15%, should‚Äôve been more tbh
If your emergency fund ain't in it, you doing it all wrong
Why is there so much resistance for NIO past $45?
I was considering getting into longer dated PTON calls. With lockdowns incoming, I see no reason it shouldn't benefit. Its also down a lot from its highs.
Nothing is rigged we are just retards
Seriously get out of nio if you want to save your money
When does BABA stop dropping ffs?
üëÜüèª made me LOL
Amen. This is why I own TCEHY forever and always.
I know right? As bad as today was, the silver lining is that this is the bottom.

I mean we already knew this. Why was yesterday the day you felt like you needed to post some dramatic ‚Äúget out of nio‚Äù post? 

It‚Äôs clear that nio is overvalued, and if you remember, I also told you I was out of it. 

I was curious about your reasoning for the post and you never responded yesterday, then wait till after it crashes when it started going way up to make some little passive aggressive post to an old thread.  

You big ü§° bruh, and if nio was sitting at 53.96 like it was earlier you‚Äôd look like an even bigger ü§°.
I am not playing but I really like SDC as a stock. Fairly reliable and lots of room to grow.

Very interested in their outlook for next year considering vaccine news, etc.

This time, Grandma is dying.
double top forming just sell bro its safer.. look at the one month chart
I know, this is why it works.
And thus NIO ends the day only 7% down after a huge bull run, despite a hit piece from Citron.

We can do it NIO bulls.
How the fuck can both a call and a put for the same company be doing badly simultaneously

Not saying LI, Xpeng, and NIO don't have value, but these plays are significantly more risky, and have more cost associated with them. Ford is an established auto player, and people trust them over the Tesla's, etc. to make a quality vehicle at a reasonable cost. They will absorb a large portion of the American EV market from people that don't perceive themselves as "tech-saavy" or have the money to splash on a luxury EV.
Don‚Äôt know if I should hold my NIO call or sell
For real. Trying to get off only reading about NIO.
NIO Paper Hands are GONE... Lets make this REAL PAPER !!! 

NIO $100+ NEXT WEEK.

I remember you was conflicted... misusing your influence..... sometimes I did the same
Get PLTR while you still can. 17+ next week
That volume on NIO is just nuts. That‚Äôs the type of volume you see on triple zero penny stocks during a pump.
SRAC calls too
Sorry man

I love to see cinemark up 10+%
This is the only way
Yeah
Smart man going to run through earnings
Good if there for next week
I think so :(

Sadly I sold puts on Baba earlier this week and I need to wait to see how those play out before I buy JD

But if they are hitting ATH amidst major Chinese political tensions that is a really good sign of where it is headed.

This is one of the buy any dip scenarios for a long position
Well that was a fucking lie
Just bought NCL $17p expiring next week, did I dun goofed?
Buy Zoom EOD??
Bought puts at top, let‚Äôs ride

Any one else want to kick me in the nuts?  Or just spy puts today...

Last chance to get into baba for next weekü§ë
I dunno. But some people are... Hight challenged, learning challenged, looks challenged, the list goes on and on. These things have an absolute material impact on their life, whether it's obvious or not, regardless of context.

Put it this way... The rock has better genes than me, and I'm guessing he's got better genes than you.

All I‚Äôve heard about in the past 2 fucking weeks here is NIO. I think they‚Äôre all dead now, finally

Theta gang ain‚Äôt bad. Just sell the types of options I‚Äôd usually buy because they expire worthless 90% of time
no selling only buying lol SPY ATH monday! gap up. you heard it hear first!
Also sold 43p for .03
This sub has def tanked hard in terms of quality and fun posts this year. Last year it peaked and was at its best in my opinion.
My thoughts exactly
NIO 44.5p 11/20 is the move
I'm gambling too but I think it's a good bet with additional shut downs possible and today's 401k bump
FSR $19 on Monday?
Baba making me depressed
Show is the way, old souls.
They‚Äôre endangered now üêºüò•

Thought I sold my NIO puts at $40 while I was in a meeting. Did not. So here I am with a bunch of $43P
Baba better dildo this shit or ima bust some heads
Citron also backed GE saying the weren't cooking their books  and the SEC had to shut Left down and file suit against GE.
I‚Äôm jacked to the tits with calls
was about to buy spy puts, then saw amzn, msft, appl, goog and fb green...so not yet
Yup, once we cool off its back to puts on this dumb shit. Cruise lines and barcades? Lmao
Yo, just graduated with a GIS degree and can confirm I %100 had this same thought in class and ESPECIALLY once I got a City Government job. PLTR is basically ArcGIS  x the Batman spy computer, but for real. Fuck it dude I'm going long now.
Bud. I had my finger on the trigger for those @.25 put in the order and it immediately ran up to .31 so I ignored and moved on. Worst decision for about 4 months.

No, I'm not, I'm just shocked to see someone spend so much money on something they understand so little of, and then posting online how they got fucked without the self-awareness to recognize they have no idea what they're doing.

I'm trying to help you. Go read a fuckin book
I bought gold once, that's about it
spy?

name a better duo. RKT and that $22 wall
Same actually. I‚Äôm expecting a gap up on Monday, I think concerns with the CCP are a bit overblown. Well see though
Sumthin Wong
Lost like 15% on call this morning though, but it was also cheaper contract
I just wanna note that I‚Äôm up 40% this year and just buy stonks. I‚Äôm too stupid to google hot to put or anti-put. But people keep asking to suck my dick so that‚Äôs nice
Please, for the sake of your family, load your boat with BABA calls. Thank me later.
Same
We should pump on Monday.

Shutdowns: tech pump

Vaccine: everything else pump
V-shape NIO recovery FTW
lol so much buying :)
Nio
Yeah good point. But I think his mindset is pull out now for short term only. Following earnings report, there will undoubtedly be some retracement in the short term. A run up like this can't continue too much longer. And his 26 target is near the 50 day moving average, which would be a great point to load up on shares for eventual rip. But I think following ER, playing with calls will be playing with fire for a while, unless theyre super long dated
The big dogs cant make any money if the price is already high, so you sell out, drop the price, buy back in with high volume and get a guaranteed return, its like pumping and dumping, but its okay because they drive BMW‚Äôs. Bid/ask baby. That or they are just already priced in and people dont see an route for more growth.
90.5 c for 12/31. Wish me luck lol
Just bought Nio calls. Hope this runs up till earnings
IT is already back to 45 ... it can't get flower than 40...
there is no chance for any significant dip prior to the 17th
Lol I know some big dogs who actively shitpost here. You don't even know half of it.
This is it NIO I wanna see 48 by close
I‚Äôm a republican, but it‚Äôs amazing what simply advocating for mask wearing can do. That, and THC and clean energy. Idk why everything is always either black or white.

True enough!

Not going to happen until at least Feb 1, though, by which time I expect we'll he hurtin' from COVID. 

I don't intend to hold these past Dec 31 anyways.
I bought NIO calls at the bottom and immediately sold because of my inability to trade successfully recently.

Supposedly since 1929 the market has done 6% better under Dems
i've been risk averse lately.  but we have moderna news potentially, but we have mango teetering on the edge of sanity.... could really go either way.  i'll probably hold some long-shots, but harvest most of the things that are green.
Nio, how's the possible?
It ends at 8PM and begins at 4AM, so you can still sleep.
$FSR 20C 11/20. You have been warned.
If you own a call, you‚Äôre not obligated to buy the 100 shares, only have the option to. Unless you‚Äôre selling a call you do not own. Like if you a call you haven‚Äôt already bought, you are on the hook if you get assigned, but if you bought that call and are selling it you are fine
Moon hour.
Ahhhh 10 minutes left of the game!
Fuck. It‚Äôs citron manipulating my meme :(

I‚Äôm deaf and I‚Äôve never heard that.....

Nah I‚Äôm good. 300% on my calls and sold at the top. Bought a leap at the bottom. Shares still up huge.
nyc shutting more shit down... city is toast
What
Looks like I'm pleasantly surprised.

Nice.
40 is the bottom for NIO.
I love seeing "markets pumping" and excitedly hopping on RH to see that I'm up 8 bucks on day
Dal $36p 12/4 because fuk airlines.
Yeah I got that now I sold the opposite call for some reason tho so that‚Äôs ass
I‚Äôm buying mine on Monday
It‚Äôs common sense that people are gunna buy the stock when it‚Äôs undervalued. NIO is worth 47 and next week will likely be up to averaging about 55. This game is easy if you understand it
Pump, pump, pump it up!
I don't need guts, I have a daytrade ban
XLE leaps
Dear Bull God, please make a PLTR pump into close happen. Amen.
Holding 30 370‚Äôs lol.  Another $30 lottery ticket.
Ew shares
Have you looked at their logo! this is the find of the century
Right? At that point, you're just trying to keep your unlimited cash safe. Multiple bank accounts across multiple currencies and multiple countries with insurance. Index stocks across different caps, countries and multiple brokerages. Properties here and there to hold value in different forms(perhaps buy all the friends/family etc houses on my name, hohoho.)  Following the advise of some fancy smancy superb financial accountant. Maybe investing in some businesses and owning rental real estate for more diversified value.

I'd never be trying to make money at that point. Just diversify it out of just cash. 

Honestly, I think 90b would make me way too stressed trying to utilise it efficiently. Just give me 80mil and call it a day. I can visualize that.
Congrats on the -99% return!
Get fucked my guy. F.
Yes you‚Äôre also a genius too!
Invested in Chinese EVs today

Down 18%

Pretty good I think. They should jump back and test $270 I hope.

I think MM's are playing some fuckery keeping it at $260, but there is low volume on BABA right now so I am not sure if the price action is reliable. Hopefully shit blows over and china calms down a bit

If we stay above 358,bullish af for Monday
Profit taking happened last few weeks on Friday. Same today. Will go up next week.
Down 80% at open
Cos this rally is a low volume FED fraud. No problem. GL!
I hedged a bit, think most of where I am at is in pretty good place with runways but would rather eat some put losses on Monday than just stare at red numbers
Hold the gold
New York dont you even look at Pittsburgh.....
Also 86 is still far below its 52 week high and it‚Äôs hovered around 80-85 for months. Idk where you got your MBA from but let me know so I don‚Äôt go to that school

People are too bearish on them right now, making me think it plays out bullish.

Yes I am.
Weak money don't make money

If every retard on this sub bought 10 shares of NIO right now it would end GREEN
Have you ever bought reddit coins? I‚Äôve said much worse shit then that and never been suspended. Wondering if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve bought so many coins
Let‚Äôs goooooo
Majority agreed to extend lockup. And that shit's got nowhere left to fall to. Already near all time low.

Also, that's not how margin calls work.
Every single option I‚Äôve bought in the last week (10) is either worthless or  down 60%

It‚Äôs going to keep heading up for at least 2-4 more weeks. Think of July-August. September wasn‚Äôt the bubble popping, many of us bears thought it was, but it was likely a reaction in the Tech sector to the Softbank news. The bubble is still growing. If you want I can send you a couple vids/indicators that explain why.

made 128% on NIO puts today.. thanks for hyping the fuck out of it guys.. knew if i watched it long enough it would top out.. whats the next ticker you guys buying?
What to buy to hold over weekend?
Just bought December autistic calls, so we are pretty much fucked now
Puts on your bank balance.
Your first mistake is thinking the market is logical.
Load up zoom calls for more shutdowns. Pittsburgh just shut down their public schools
Still holding my NIO November 27 44C .... From $3.97, sitting at $6.87

You can imagine what it was this morning :(
Xpeng go brrrr
Funnest day on the market in a while
That's like Apple in the 80's laughing at Microsoft for not building computers for their software.
When there are unexplained random insano rallies after choppy weeks, it is difficult to not  have the impulse to purchase them. If you are insure an want to risk less, buy a VXX call contract a buck out of the money - usually run you about $50-60 a contract instead of a few hundo
Nio climbing back into shrek territory
Good EOD play?
Any regrets?
do we want to hold travel over the weekend?
Goog def. to the moon before SPCE. Both literally and figuratively
I think rsi is irrelevant these days
Monday will see a run up but after the numbers are out it's up in the wind. The numbers will be good, the question is whether they're better than what people expect. I'm gonna say yeah itll LIKELY go up after ER with a really good report
So you can hear? That's good
Bought 1 Call here $spx $3585 on this pullback
Do I need to contact customer support?
I'm a fucking idiot, I doubted my vibe so hard today and if I didn't, I'd be up a 5 bagger instead of being down 25%.
You know that's not true. We're everywhere.
Selling diagonal covered calls against my LEAP is stupid money whether I just pocket the premium or end up having to close the whole position.
Snap
Because you caught the gay
my brain says no

my balls say yes
BA puts at 12:30 were a bad idea
It would have been 56 by now if citron didn‚Äôt manipulate things
We still talking about that retard in this sub?
You shouldn't trade this market if you can't get in and out same day, someone change my mind.
Your fine. Red Monday
What we openin at mon
I'm starting to believe in the power of the democrats!!!
Roll it out, shit is ridiculous
Thanks, I appreciate the sentiment, I'll try to keep my head up. Only making $13.5/hr so my available stack to play with isn't much. Congrats on the big gain!
Nah, they‚Äôre holding till dec. when the ipo lockup expires.  Shits gonna fall off a cliff.
you know that NIO is pinned at 45 for today. play accordingly.
SPY will float at 358
NIO right now, any strike, any date. Don't wait, or be sad af next week.
they have autonomous driving programs too. Shit, every car maker has an autonomous program. Tesla's not going anywhere but it's ridiculous to think Tesla is somehow so far ahead on this shit.
very cool and very real pump
If you want it to be -99% on monday sure
Of course it‚Äôs NIO.
It took me a while to understand the terminology too. If you sell a contract "to close", meaning selling one you previously bought, you owe nothing to anyone ever.

If you sell a call to open a contract, meaning you wrote the call in the first place (aka selling a call on the Robinhood options finder screen, if that's what platform you're using), that's when you could potentially owe someone else 100 shares.
Already almost back up ü§∑ IN NIO WE TRUST
If you buy NIO report back with gain porn üí¶

Obviously I woundnt hold . Just took 75% and bailed
Relax, next week is Nio's week. Profit taking on Fridays has been happening with NIO in the past weeks. Hold over the weekend and rejoice.
BABA just give me a sign that everything will be ok

Who‚Äôs yoloing chwy 11/20 70c with me
Shit, I can walk away for the weekend with some gains or risk holding for a green Monday. I‚Äôm leaning towards taking my gains. I know I‚Äôll have peace of mind, but the tendies I could get...

What do you retards do?

# load NVDA calls before you see it at $600 after earnings
Watch us open @365
imagine not taking out a second, third, and fourth fraudulant mortgages on yours and both your neighbors homes, a PPP loan, selling your wife, kids, and dog to the chinese to use as laborers,  starting up a fake EV company, SPAC, etc. pumping the stock with dodge hellcats photoshopped with an alternate logo and using the money to go all in NIO
Lol bears ü§≠
Bought the bottom at 41
Been buying it. Still will make money buying at these levels with calls for next week.
I wasn‚Äôt even talking about myself, the fact that you didn‚Äôt get that just puts your dumb shit brain on display
Check the volume. NIOstreetbets is everywhere
Implied volatility you fucking moron.  Do I really need to explain it?  NIO is up 200% since September.  Do you really think a company with shady financials and limited history can keep that up?
I‚Äôm fucking holding these SPY puts expiring Monday. I feel unpatriotic, sorry America
r/brandnewsentences
Over or under Trump being more then 20 mins late?
Too early for that. Definitely in December though.
Thank you for the information. I guess I‚Äôm never sleeping now!
Already back higher than Monday

deaf people are typically called deafie so idk what's wrong with that lol. I'm deaf also though I'm using a cochlear implants.
Just kidding, sold a few covered calls. Hoping it goes down more next week
My first experience was in 2016 when nvda went from $30's to around $110. Citron did an article and it went down the next few days to the $90s. I was so shocked I sold it off and it didn't take long to come back.  I realized just join citron and short what they do.
Yes. ER on tues moon on monday
Why? Looks like a dead ticker to me
Me on 100mg Vyvanse on 11/9 buying SPY calls thinking I‚Äôm going to game the system
NIO wont break 45 due to opex going on. Moon mission resumed Monday.

MM's got exactly what they wanted out of that Citron short report. They probably sold puts to a bunch of you too.
Last chance to buy into NIO get your free money now
I don't always play 0 days but when I do I sell when I'm up 15% instead of üíé‚úã till 3x.

Yeah you better run.
MRNA: we spray it from the air and it's 99%

AAL to $120
It's going up because it wants to go up. What is going on that would stop it? Market doesn't care about covid until lockdowns actually happen. Market doesn't care about mango's temper tantrum either.

Yeah
BABA. Wait till after earnings for NIO.
Holy shit that guy‚Äôs a fucking legend. Good fucking call.
LOL Chinese shit

If you were paying attention at all you'd know that it didn't dip because of the Chinese, it dipped because of Citron wanting it to dip. 

If you paid attention you'd also know that NIO is all anyone has talked about today since open
This is the way
It ‚Äúpopped‚Äù from 80 to 86. Congrats on the 8% but if you expect me to believe you made half a mil on that, try not to act like a clown. Unless you‚Äôre some trust fund kid gambling away the hard earned family money, you‚Äôre completely lying. Nobody with tens of millions to actively invest makes a post that looks like it was written by someone in high school
Someone give me some good calls to buy under the assumption nobody cares about COVID and we moon next week. Over leveraged in calls and puts for COVID resurgence. Need some hedge.
MA went up $5 from 130-330. Nothing to see here

**"During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying 'this is their new hoax.'" **

It's hilarious how easy that was to find and how his entire base still can't seem to find it.

Again though, tell me how being disgusted at the same amount of people dying every 2 days as died in 9/11 is somehow" drinking the Kool aid"

The RNC is great at yelling about 3000 deaths and starting a 9 trillion dollar war over it, along with a campaign of racism against Middle Easterners, and yet will laugh and downplay literal thousands of Americans dying in isolation every day.
Roll rest of it over into SRACW

Sell puts, you can collect premium if it goes up or reduce your cost basis if it goes down (unless it goes REALLY down, but I don't think it will)
Lol there‚Äôs no way their ER are going to be epic. Today was just a the stock correcting itself. It‚Äôs worth 47 right now and will be worth in the 50s after
I‚Äôm feelin it
I donated $420.69 to the autism research foundation, AKA our retirement fund, since I made so much off that Monday pop with the vaccine announcement. I feel like the incredibl luck i had with nio, netting around 7k in total was because of the good Karma, and not because I'm a genius trader or anything. Give some gains back if you can, its good for the soul.
Was up 500 bucks this am to down 2200 YES
I dont like this chinese EV rugpull smh
SPY has got to be ü©≥‚Äôs getting impatient and buying it up for inevitable lockdown only to get Bitch slapped by MRNA vaccine having 99% efficacy and is just a drop of liquid that cures rona instantly. Or lockdown.

Dude, if the old Tech Bubble teaches us one thing it's that just because an industry is going to the moon, doesn't mean it can't form a bubble.
your statement is ambiguous:  if I sell "my" xyz call option.  If you already own the option, then selling just that exact option back would close the position.  If you don't already own it, then you are opening the position...and selling call options (to open) carry unlimited risk.

You are right....you need to do more homework before trading these.
[deleted]
Buying near all time highs right before the weekend with covid cases booming and fresh lockdowns being implemented seems reasonable, right?
What? Why? It's up big

I know y'all on the China Flu hustle for EV's, but why not play Ford leaps? Low IV, low Theta, decent Delta and Gamma... Feels like easy money...
This is ridiculous.

Red Monday, red all next week
When spy finishes with almost 30 green one minute candles in a row I'm buying puts for the last 15 minutes.  Lets jump in front of a bus.
This is one of the most ridiculous pumps ive seen in a long time. Glad im jacked to the tits in calls.
What‚Äôs the point of red days when it‚Äôs -0.1%
ADR‚Äôs are just a piece of paper in the Caymans. People should look into more direct ownership schemes if they want to trust their money with the communists.

Would really dig a KCAC dip to buy tho ngl.

PT 180.
FUCKING MOOOOOONNNNNN
one last pump to wipe out the bears before the weekend. it's the american way
This really was a bad day but I'm confident it'll keep going up then soar after earnings like LI and XPEV
That was the dip. Load up
I feel so touched I made a random person on reddit tell me that on WSB, somebody has a "repetitive spammy nature", and "it's just very bizarre."..

Because isn't that... uh..  like, well, every single post and person on here already..

Wow, you really got me figured out now.

Well, I guess see you on the next Spammy repetitive post... I guess it will just be bizarre.

RH glitching hard. Saying I‚Äôm up $900 today which isn‚Äôt true
Didn't know this was the last session before JD ER, would have played more aggressively
Yeah I wish I wasn‚Äôt so greedy while I was half awake at 6:45am. Tried to sell at the top of the bid ask when it was 53-54 and it didn‚Äôt fill, then watched $4000k slip away. Learned a valuable lesson though losing $4k trying to gain an extra $10.
You really have to be a monkey brained retard not to make money in this market.

Calls can be expensive if sellers price them higher. simple as that. I had a call with no buyer or other sellers and I priced it at like a godly amount so my account balance looked great!

That awkward moment where you know for a fact if you buy calls and hold over the weekend, it will definitely open red, vise versa, and if you stay cash, market will be up 2% just because and you feel like you want to kill yourself.
yo WTF happened to Chinese EV today? all time high to all time broke.
Time for a boring ass weekend. I live to trade and lurk here pretty much
love the flair
funny how their report says, its a good company, just pricy for now because they have competition. So Citron is basically saying after all their research, Nio is a legit company
who were the guys sayin spy 360 eow on tuesday. here is a reddit gold award:

.(*).
Jokes on you I don‚Äôt even know what that means

> It follows that if someone has covid, the test will never be negative. 

With that assumption it also implies that Musk definitely doesn't have covid because he got negative tests, so we can't calculate the probability that he does. 

I'm not sure how bad these tests are but I'll go with [this source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/what-are-covid-19-rapid-tests-and-how-accurate-are-they-answers-to-common-questions/ar-BB19CuAR) that says they have a 50% false negative rate.

My math says 0.03% chance that Musk has covid given that he had 2 negatives and 2 positives, which is actually surprisingly low to me.

If you want to check my math: https://i.imgur.com/PL9q5AE.png
So this transaction has 2 legs:

1) the credit put spread: this is a bullish play, I‚Äôm essentially betting the stock stays above $28 by June. If it falls below $28 by expiration, my max loss is 13k here (30k -17k credit I received). So I have some risk here.

2) long calls: more bullishness. I took the 17k, and used 2k of it to buy very cheap calls on XME near my short put on the put spread. This made my call position free. Now I‚Äôm fucked if this doesn‚Äôt get above $28 by June. But until then, I‚Äôll have received $15k free, plus whatever my calls rack up to.

You shouldn‚Äôt do this with highly volatile stocks, it works best with low vol stocks and especially well with cyclical sectors. You can lever up yourself with more confidence this way.

I neutralized IV crush and theta decay, and primarily benefit from vol staying low and positive. I can neutralize vol by purchasing puts and doing call credit spreads in the short term to avoid sudden/permanent down moves

I don't know how people are not selling and taking profit going into the worst weekend of CoVid yet....  I'm not saying there market is going to drop like in March or even near it, but, come on...
Whether that happens or not, that rationale makes exactly zero sense.
 But you didn‚Äôt lose anything.. how much would you have freaked out if the scale went the other way
Not the bulls that bought calls today lol.
Will you 10x it?
sell it now and then buy another calls
If you were going to buy the dip, you should have done it at 40....

NIO 50+ at market open Monday, heard it here first
Says the guy who waited a day to reply to an old thread
The more lockdowns they announce the more $SPY rips!
Play whichever seems more retarded honestly
Fuck. This comment was so fascinating read bro. I‚Äôm SORTA like that... but I wouldn‚Äôt be that much. There‚Äôs a guy where I live he owns a ton of restaurants he‚Äôs like 78 years old and still works at one of his restaurants till like 3 am and he has tens of millions of dollars to his name... of course he‚Äôs Greek though. They work till they die.
NIO parabolic? oof wait until you see Monday
BEARS ARE IN SHAMBLES
I went in on leaps. It‚Äôs held around 400 a while now
Alot of movement can happen premarket with these stocks.
A lot of puts/open interest on dec 18th aiming for 10% drop in pretty much everything
I‚Äôm holding
that'll be a money printer for my 11/20 20.00 P
Better buy while NIO is still on sale. You wait too much longer and it won't be a dip. Do you want to be delivered to tendie town or nah?
If I ever have this amount of money in my life I will be so happy. Not even memeing.

oh, youre one of those special kind of retard
Yeah, everyone always forgets NIO is trading "overnight" for us in China. I bet they see this dip as a huge buying opportunity.

Gap up Monday back to 50.
Peapod with the biggest ever failure when it comes to deciding to shut down
Ended up very good. Think 45K or so on NIO options today. Breaking out the good Ramen tonight.
Weekend plays? Will tip 10% of profit
Whoever timed the NIO bottom at 41 is a god. Alright boys waters clear for NIO time to get back in for ER lmao
Geez I think you‚Äôre more hurt than me about the loss.
Up, it's now at its highest point since the beginning of August.
Nio has made the so much money this week. Not in raw gains but just the amount of successful trades I got off it. A hellva week to end on dude.
You're gonna need Pooh to let him out of the camp
Please take all my money
This sub is ridiculous
Dude get a life
I'm totally going to regret holding these Monday SPY calls that are up 70% already aren't I?  Why can't I just sell !
So damn true haha
His actions since arriving suggest otherwise. Unless you think being open about the issues that GE faces are things that push stock prices up.

There was a broader sell on green tech stuff at the same time, which often tracks pretty closely together

CLSK, SPWR, ENPH, and so on.  

So I think that general sell + specific NIO news caused a little wave amplification there.  I bought that dip
BABA seriously
It‚Äôs implied volatility. Watch YouTube videos on it, understand it, or you‚Äôll be broke guaranteed.
Maybe not then lol
I went with spy puts today and boy oh boy was that wrong

I am keep feeling that we will have all those ‚Äúcovid shutdown‚Äù news all over the weekend and gap down big next Monday, but I can confidently say that most of time I‚Äôm wrong and regret about my decision. Maybe this will be the time to inverse myself and buy 11/19 SPY 362C

yup. starting to feel the same about next week too
Yea I sold too early now I‚Äôm just scalping lmfao
Sell on Monday when it drills pre earnings
Can confirm did not time roght
NIO checking support for one last 3:45 push, green by close
Virus curve is already flattening in Europe and we are following them 2-3 weeks behind so it will flatten here in a few weeks.
You‚Äôre either really dumb or intentionally missing the point.

My question yesterday was what was your reasoning for how strongly you were advising to get out of nio. 

You never answered, then waited till today after nio opened up 15% and then dropped significantly to come back and say ‚Äúthis is why‚Äù.

At no point have you answered why you thought it was so important to get out of nio and only the fortunate drop it took today has made you not appear to be a monumental idiot.
And with the retracement out the way... its gonna be fun watching the short squeeze combined with earnings beat mixed with turbo chinese investors. Ni how‚Äôzz dem apples

This stock is heavily manipulated being backed by the Chinese government and MM's, but my break even is 72.00 , but I have the rest of November for it to close in the high 50's or 60's before selling and rolling it farther out. Just hold, then sell it day of earnings and buy back in on a dip.

Ah that sucks.  Yeah I was hoping to unload my shares through assignment but that went out the window once that report came out.  If you think it's going to hit your targets stick with it but might as well take profits when/if you can and either reduce your cost basis or re-invest to get even more shares.  Good luck man.

All I can figure is the logical move is down due to Covid craziness, so MMs pushing higher to burn majority. They may get away with it if it weren‚Äôt for djt, they aren‚Äôt expecting all the hell he is about to raise. Or at least not giving it the consideration it deserves. He will be the catalyst and I don‚Äôt think he will be pumping
Spy calls both conservative and lotto. All in on Boomer stocks as of this morning after selling my puts on the same shit yesterday.

They have developed a water propulsion system for powering their rockets, pretty genius when you find out that water is on the moon and on plenty of asteroids. They have plans to mine asteroids for water of course so that covers fuel. Plus NASA themselves gave momentus a shout out. This company has got a lot going for them.  Deals with Space X, NASA etc. Check out their YouTube page.

Citron vs wsb, who's gunna win?

Eventually yes. EV is the future.
If you‚Äôre referring to just selling the original call I bought I couldn‚Äôt sell it cause of day trading limits
Rip those who missed the dip, it's gonna go back up
Lmao
[deleted]
Missed the zoom dip :/
Got in at 44.77, oh man here we go again
You cant go wrong by betting on the dog with the biggest scar in the kennel. If he's still fighting after that injury you know he's tough as fuck.
With the recent rally, y‚Äôall think NIO going for green ? If so I sold my 50C at a huge loss....oh well finding 43/44 call right now
I got shaken out at $38 when I wasn't paying attention with a stop loss.

Bought the dip and am up 10% today.

Serves me right for thinking I was an 'investor' and not a dipshit.
TO ALL NIO üêª EAT SHIT CUNTS!
Are you getting ass‚Äôd or rollin
One day we care about Covid the next it doesn‚Äôt matter got it
It would be the most NIO thing ever if it still finished today in the green.
So spy at an all time high..... cool....
SPY tracks covid cases now. You haven't heard?
Any thoughts on kush stocks? I was planning on going heavy into marijuana
[removed]
This is amazing
It can't due to the catalyst that brought it up this high. If anything any upgrades from big names will boost it to 60+
I bought 15 mins back
I failed out of my economics major in college but somehow I‚Äôm doing ok at this game
Please make sure to go right to the metals desk and shit in their coffee maker. Fuck those losers.

I've googled the term and know that delta is how the option moves with respect to the underlying price, but what does "decent" mean?  Like, I'll look at the delta and not know whether it's good or bad....
Probably just bought UAL and CCL at the top. But let‚Äôs goooo mangoooo... 500 million vaccines in the fridge chillin right now.
Put that one in savings, son.
That's okay BABA, you go up when you feel like it
Damn vix still dropping even with a new wave of lockdowns and travel restrictions looming, are otm vxx calls for next week actually free money rn?
IDk man, they said to buy Nio 2 years ago at $7. They did pretty well so far, and a retracement after earnings short term makes sense
AAPL finally green.
not even worth calling the SEC over..
I post this kind of shit all the time.

Are you winning kids?
Nio saying not today boys
Definitely hold for now
I have a 100% chwy atvi nio calls portfolio and I am losing hair by the second
My nio puts did just fine, buddy.
Spy up a whole 1.5% and I'm down 1%. 

Not very cash money of me
NIO to the moon babyy
Citron dead
Its literally at yesterday's price
This NIO v shape
Moderna calls for mangos speech?
yes
Only thing i can think is this dude is hung like Scottie pippen, only reason she‚Äôs around
CRSR
MEEEEEE
Roger that
Fuck it I‚Äôm switching to it gonna play No time for caution with 3 minutes to go
Lol what! No way, i Will sell like monday or tuesday
I used the last bit of cash. Only have 400 left of risk tolerance leverage.
Quick up date. I sold my put and the bottom, and got 5 calls..up like 300 on those alone
Could have made an extra $1200 holding my NIO $45C til open yesterday and another $800 if I had gotten up on time today. So I guess not really greed so much as bad timing. But hey, at least I didn't lose money. Gonna have to be more careful though.
Blew all my buying power chasing it down to 40s. :/ this is gonna hurt...
2 weekend plays:

* JD calls for pre-market earnings Monday.

* Either SPY puts or SPXS calls for more bad covid news hitting by Monday.
Thinking the same lol, not sure if it‚Äôs worth staying with
EL O FUCKING EL

SPX
Andrew Left is a fucking the equivalent of shitty toilet bowl water
Tony
their first shipment arrived like two weeks ago and will be used for pr, would be a miracle if someone did
Yeah we'll have to see what happens. I originally expected sell off after earnings regardless of results because of this unsustainable run up/profit takers, but after today's dip maybe a good earnings report is actually enough to kick it back up.
Did I stumble into r/Investing? GTFO with dIvErSiFiCaTiOn. Retard.

Nah I just did my research and know that citron ain‚Äôt shit

Yes. Fuck boomer vehicle stocks. The only reason companies like Tesla, LI, NIO, XPEV exist is because the boomer vehicle stocks thought it was better to lobby the government against global warming instead of investing in EV tech the last 40 years.

yeah. i shouldvw probably gotten like dec calls, but whatever. We'll see what happens
wb PINS
Clearly a group of wealthy 4 year old market manipulating Robin Hood traders, forcing the price down so they can add to their 8 figure accounts!!!!
Almost impossible to profit with that strategy. You‚Äôll have some big winners, some flat, some big losses. Pick 10-15 and set a timeline for how long you want to hold. Cull the weak ones add to the strong ones pick up new stocks. Stick to a timeline and don‚Äôt try to get cute buying and selling tops and bottoms.
Bought in today Just for fun. Small position 550$
lol now its time for nio to fuck those who bought puts at the bottom
Bro, I bought for an additional 10K USD at 52-53 today :D

But I honestly believe we'll be around 60 USD EOW
Yeah, that was the joke...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
We already had our correction in September AND October where SPY dropped from $350s to $320s not once but twice. The correction is over.
Hahahah, true dat.
Citron shidding and farding and cumming his pants
Ok is anyone buying tsla for Monday?
Let‚Äôs hope
Institutions not buying in on citrons shitty research on a growing industry.
It was a sympathy play for the other EV‚Äôs because the EV stock market literally acts like a casino üëçüèº

Getting a $1500 covid relief bonus on my next check- what shall I gamble on
You think Trump will show up to press conferences on time now? I bet this is going to be like one of his old conferences, where he answers questions for a long time and the entire thing lasts 2 hours.

I thought lockdowns help tech/e-commerce/dropshipping
Who's holding this weekend?
If you knew it was gonna crash then post your fucking positions you little bitch
Now the question is whether I hold over the weekend after buying the dip
Solo all the way baby I'm up 100% in a few days on shares.... 

My calls are out of this world. Bought at $2.98 and I'm holding till at least $420
NIO BABY
Netscape
Something really weird going on. It's such a consistent pattern. AH limit up, bad news all day, slow decline, AH limit up, repeat. Literally the only good news is a 90% effective vaccine with no indication of a wide rollout in the next year. At the same time we're getting 150k cases a day. Even if the vaccine comes out in 6 months (half of the lowest time estimate for a phase 3 trial) then 27M people will contract covid and thats assuming the daily rate stays flat from here.
Where the peeps who were shouting $60 EOD
you ever just ignore your problems till they go away?


this marker sure is
Doh! I bought more of xpev. Scared of earnings these days. Hope I'm alright

What's a good buy for the weekend? I'm thinking of 350p 11/20
had 155 sold before that dip, could've be a sell off as it rose this much and it needs a healthy pullback
[removed]
Yeah I‚Äôm really not sweating yet it looks like a good setup and it‚Äôs a meme stock so it‚Äôll go nuts if it gets momentum
NIO is at 545 million volume. Just fucking insane.

Bought 46/39ps in revenge, then it joined into yesterday close

sold out of those at breakeven today thinking it was the morning dip

Put a condor on it 46/48 55/56 for 1.85 credit mid free fall

Bought back the c half for 1k profit at 42

Sitting on the p credit spread now 

It‚Äôs been a roller coaster day!
NIO is rising, id sell while you can

If you‚Äôre on RH you can still sell, you‚Äôll just be banned from buying for 90 days. If it‚Äôs a matter of saving your life savings it‚Äôs worth it tbh
lockdowns incoming, loaded up on pins calls
Market is clearly signaling good news about reopening question is what does this do to the tech trade if it persists? Is this really just because of the call for Georgia this afternoon?

If u rnt buying nio, u rnt gynese!
OK... Then buy Ford.

We'll check back in any time frame to see you did terrible.

Remember when people made fun of tsla around this valuation....
Maybe, but today would have been the most likely day for it to happen. I was hoping for a dip but bought some more right when it was breaking the resistance at 15.
you'll be lucky to stay above 400
it was down 14% at one point
What yall holding over the weekend?
Hold the line br√∂ther
Shorts run to fucking cover !!!!!! Oh shit
Well the ifunny watermark is cropped out
what a crazy fucking day, man! my calls were worth 4k at open and it went down all the way down to 2087 and now they're at 3300, but I'm pretty optimisitc about the movement next week
Once you are marked as PDT, you cannot buy a stock and sell it the same day, or they will lock your account. But you can buy and sell anything the next day with no worries. I am currently PDT as well
They contributed a dip right before earnings LOL
PLUG my butthole
I sold them calls at open right before the dump lol
Yeah not for long
Right after I take a 1k loss on my contracts lmao
no but it would hurt tech market overall
Yes
Yeah I am in January 5s.  When it pulls back I might add some more and I expect some pullback.

Looking any better after this pump, what's your breakeven? I sold my puts at the bottom of this little guy and bought some 12/4 50 C s to ride whatever wave we have left, but I don't know about holding over the weekend, million dollar question I guess.
The buttholes with puts are screaming ‚Äústop the count!!‚Äù
November 17th will be the deal maker or breaker
i Will hold my shares until this stupid ass company goes out of business

Not sure if I want to grab more going into a shaky weekend.

AMD 82.5p 11/20 sell?

BAC 28p 11/27 keep?
Thanks for the info.  I definitely can see your thesis and we know the company is too big to fail already.  Trading a stock with high liquidity also never hurts particularly if some options are getting thrown into the mix!

I love the stock market but goddam the greed that Andrew Left displayed is fucken sickening. I'm still good on all my positions and we all know NIO will rebound but, this really struck a chord with me. I'm legit disgusted that a human being will go to those lengths for greed.
Hold PDD 11/20 $160c over the weekend?
NIO LETS GOOOO BABI I LOVE YOU. YOU SCARED ME
Lockdowns coming soon
What do NIO trade at on Monday opening bell?
Far too sensible for this sub. That said, put $1000 into $15 GME January calls and thank me later.

DO WE KEEP NIO OVER THE WEEKEND AND THROUGH EARNINGS?
One pisstini, shaken, not stirred
the run up to NIO's earnings are going to be insane i bet
Y‚Äôall when Nio goes down: ‚ÄúStupid WSB. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt buy meme stocks‚Äù

When Nio goes up: ‚ÄúYou are stupid if you didn‚Äôt buy the dip‚Äù
If you don‚Äôt buy the NIO dip, you ain‚Äôt black.
if you didnt sell when we opened at 52 just hold....
My wife says Andrew is the best bf. He may be short in NIO but he is really long where it matters.
Need a job. Just fired from the New Yorker for jerking off on a ZM call. I then went for a yolo on $ZM calls, thinking it was a sign, but that crapped out. Anyone need a fluffer?

NIO is a day-trader's wet dream.
I don't know.. i Will wait next week because i sense some vaccine news are ready to fuck with the market
the more that governors come on TV and talk about increased COVID restrictions the more and more the nmarket pumps

what in the fuck
Things only workout for me when I do thoughtless shit. Its only a hunned though
earnings are next week, an IV is through the roof.
Bruh NIO on that retard energy
Die spy die
RH doesn‚Äôt allow same day expiry options. Still printed regardless.
LOL nio 10% BACK TO ATH!
If tsla end green.. I‚Äôll drink my cum

Spy is gonna dump bigly at close. These governors aren't even waiting till market close for bad news and I'm sure plenty more coming over the weekend once the ball starts rolling.

Nope NIO has a price floor of 40. Anything near will cause it to spike back to 45+.

&#x200B;

Narrator: And Indeed it was
I hedged with a couple zoom calls just in case it's bad news and lockdowns but I just don't see Trump going that route
Thanks for the strat. Il use it in my next YOLO
Hi üëã from another SWE.
Fckkk weak handed my 42 NIO call again ....I knew I averaged down all day for a reason ...
NIO $60 EOD
SOLO
[removed]
Cause they already released really good earnings and guidance. If NIO stays below 47-48 until earnings then we get the potential for moonshot again, there was always going to be a pullback at some point after that kind of run up. The question was just how big it would be/how long it took to settle.
NIO put holders suddenly got real quiet
SPY 15m RSI bout to go overbought
ZOOM TDOC LFGOOOOOOOO
just look up ARKQ etf holdings and copy their moves
IV would like to have a word with you
That‚Äôs iv my bro
Yeah i don‚Äôt really know my calls just dropped again even as it‚Äôs continuing up I‚Äôm starting to get pissed..looks like we need a killer week to get them really moving
Wrong
I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not asking a serious question.  It got up to 53 because idiots bid it up that far.  My puts are still doing fine, thanks.
Cashed out $2.5k NIO in two days then bought back in with half that after dip today... only down 2% hoping it‚Äôll run
Think PLTR will ever drop back to 12 or 13 so I can load up on more shares?
Its called IV my friend.
HAHA EAT SHIT PUSSY BEAR
And that‚Äôs why, folks, we hedge with puts.

Sold my puts when I woke up at 2pm, purchased more stock, keeping my original 15% total as cash and using it to just purchase more puts now.

60% nio and still made money today
Has Branson been sent to SPCE? üöÄüöÄ

Buying back into NIO calls Monday lmao
the comeback we need
Yeah, that was me at 11 this morning.
That blue one on the right has lips that look like a prolapsed anus, which is exactly what happened to me after buying NIO calls.
this is the way
[deleted]
Can we get a rip and rally to close pls
About to hatemail andrew these nuts
I mean, that's great for humanity.  But what about _my_ needs?
To be fair it may not be as malicious as it looks.

Typically you're an analyst because you cannot trade. So the analysts may get it wrong while the Traders get it right
Thanks dude
Lmao nerd üá®üá≥üöÄüìà
AAPL over 115-a thinking persons atrocity. Gimme a fukin break.

Was up $150 my phone died and I lost my charger, went back NIO was $44, fucking chinese crap
good work. this should be a new copypasta
nio green by close I guess
Agree. Also, don‚Äôt want to compare this to NKLA for obvious reasons, but remember when NKLA ran from $14 to $90 On American EV hype? Well this one is actually the real deal potentially. Could totally see a similar multibagger run here in the next few months.
Come on 230 Spy dump
Lmaoüëå
can elon just announce cheaper tsla or something over the weekend to compete with these chinese ev my shares would really appreciate
Dumbass you know you can sell options to lock in gains right?
How are my spy calls up and my qqq calls down. Both are up today.  WTF man.

QQQ rises two points and I lose $50
Ever NIO vehicle comes with a set of those novelty testicles people hang on the bumper of their pickup truck
Pump and dump  just like it did before reverse merger. It has a tainted brand too.
And thus the NIO faithful diamond hands bulls are rewarded for their efforts with good tendies and good snap backs from bear shit fits.
I‚Äôll drink to that, they got me! Imma get FOMO tatted on my forehead. My tattoo parlor are having specials since it‚Äôs Friday the 13th.

Andrew Left - that's the name to remember when taking your winnings on Tuesday
I was thinking of buying a weekly NIO call at -15% but break even point was literally +13% fuck that shit have fun boys
Get out while you still can
Makes me question VIX more than anything given the current climate. I have OTM 12/24 UVXY calls, cheap as dirt.
XPEV buy and hold fuckers. This thing is backed by Jack Ma, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. That‚Äôs my Dd
March 100c
RKT on a moon mission!
That dude who said amazon closes green and he'll drink his pee right now ; üò¨
the dip next week will be from $20 down to $17
fucking right. We going back to Mars baby
why u think that
PDT here; I wish your money all the best on the trip it's going to take w/o you.
Chart is topped at R. 

Could break out and moonshot. But solar seems to have taken a backseat and is in consolidation mode until it‚Äôs 100% certain ü•≠ is gone 

Imo.
Buy when everyone‚Äôs scared, the company has good future outlooks. 

Might as well throw $100 into it and see what happens
Andrew left is the agent smith of the matrix. Nio is the one and it will be bring balance to the matrix.
SPY mooning because of the vaccine. QQQ is mooning because virus cases are raging.
Yes or let them expire worthless on Monday
$NIO open 54 Monday
ü•≤
55 by Monday??
That is impossible they do not have data center customers. That is where the big money is.
Imagine if both Lil yacthy and uzi drop an album together...
Screenshots or ban
NIO puts up 600% to -80% in 1 hour WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT, THE UNDERLYING IS $3 BELOW
CRSR on its way to $100
Shit, guess you‚Äôre right then.
I like N√è√ò
Not allowed to do options.
Bought NIO puts yesterday. Sold for a loss this morning. I‚Äôm an embarrassment to my family
I'll make it up on Fiston or Fisler or whatever. EV to the moon!
NIO to $60 next week. Fuck off you fat bear. Go back to hibernation you fucking üêª
Lol that Nio Fomo into close HAHA
[deleted]
Yes they were. On this sub, with top notch DD. Got in because of wsb retards at $6. Most here were like "meh gyna, don trust, murica n¬∞ 1!". Sold round 17. Got in again at 18.5, sold at 47.9 today. Nio buys me a ps5 for christmas :) Unless it dips below 40, then i'll rather go again on this cool nio ride.
Hold
QQQ too high imo

Both vaccine pump and Covid lockdowns/reality  hurts QQQ.  Time to buy SQQQ to sell Monday.
It‚Äôs a great idea to diversify. Spend 50k in NIO calls, 50k xpeng calls and 50k Li auto calls. You can‚Äôt go wrong with Chinese EV. One of these will be 1k soon.
ER next week though. Could get a last minute pump.
Now it makes sense
What‚Äôs the play on CNK?? Thing won‚Äôt die
Andrew left can suck my autistic nutsack
Honestly? Leave this place and never look back. Literally just put all of that on SPY/QQQ (or if you're feeling bold, put _some_ of it in UPRO/TQQQ) and then just live your life and don't even worry about market watching. I'll probably get banned for this bc it's genuinely good advice, but yeah this is not the place for you.
BABA all inÔºÅ
You talking about chess?
Yeah fuck this guy or team
What are your thoughts on ATVI?
NIO
Sell? Ban
Nope they sold off in hopes to buy back with a price floor of 40.

We could close flat and I'll still be -10% on my NIO 11/20 IC's opened yesterday lmao

IV next week is over 200% jfc
All these COVID restrictions announcements.. feel like puts for Monday is the move
Some üåàüêª at Citreon with expiring puts today...

It‚Äôs comical how many times I average down on a position only to sell at break even then it fucking MOONS. Like Jesus FUCK

need me to clap them cheeks on the board again?
if you were smart you can deduce that overall today the big boys are net long going into the close and the small guys are net short. Who do you think wins this battle?

Is this the second coming of NIO?
What we holding over the weekends bros
Hey be nice to nio
I've got the 40c Jan 2023 LEAP and sold a 52c 11/20 against it. IV was around 220% on it.

If it hits I'll still be up bigly on my LEAP so I won't be too upset. I'm bullish on NIO but to be honest I think it will trade flat or slightly down on earnings, at least by the end of the week. Huge YoY growth is already priced in based on Xpeng and to a lesser extent Li auto methinks.

Get ready for Lockdown Monday
Buying puts on your portfolio
[deleted]
Regardless of what NIO does from here to earnings, NIO puts were the play of the day. These things always dip as people take profits.
I sold my expiring AMZN $3200 call for $3. If It somehow becomes ITM it'll be hilarious.
SOLO leaps are cheap af rn
 this nigga work for Citron
Sorry 0_0
Not yet
No one cares about how you yolo $200.
NIO is on pace to exceed 550 million share volume for today's trading
Monday: vaccine news, Boeing max, Trump concede, Biden announce stimulus, bearish CNBC

\>>>> SPY 400 Monday bois, 50 baggers
there's no doubt in my mind that Trump is going to dump the market before he voluntarily/is forced to leave office and spend 4 years saying "only i can bring it back"

but fuck being a bear is expensive
Yes earnings next week
You are a retard LOL
NIO fixin to close green this is crazy
Don‚Äôt rock the boat... stay ashore.
Lol it is gonna pop to 20+ on Monday tho there‚Äôs news this weekend
cash is a position boys
You‚Äôre supposed to sell the strike above your contract...
Fuck I really missed out on PDD
NIO bear R FUK
Hair line went back 3 inches today

NIO going back to 50
Who knows. This whole slide down has been irrational.
Bears been staring at their screen for hours waiting for the dump. It ain't coming boys
why? you can still sell. I dont see the problem
How come?? It dropped already
**buy nio puts right now**
Wow just checked in on nio. As someone who stayed away I fuckin love to see that

reopening trades man, these degens are just taken aback by ev today, hopefully they realize there is still an obvious play
yeah my 11/20 25c's went down almost 50% today tf. i did buy some more at that point, but the stock's up 3% today and my calls are still down 10%. tf haha
NIO's a beast, will def close green.
The boys in Taiwan will feast on the dip
I‚Äôm a retard and sold NIO at the bottom should I buy back in?
Price floor is 40. BUY before it is too late. I was a NIO meh and now I am a NIO bull.
And also lower risk since it‚Äôs a Canadian company and not Chinese.
Bezos came out with an amazon exclusive vaccine, sold with prime shipping.
So BIGC is dead dead huh?
once again just so the bears know larger orders (orders greater than 100 on ES) have a delta of +6189 into close rn. Little guys (less than 5 contracts) have delta into the close at -5884. Delta measures the aggressiveness of buyers and sellers. Do with that information as you would like.
That‚Äôs awesome hahaha

Lol today was rotate from NIO to NKLA
V shape retardery
Anything that is doing a few % in a short amount of time on a friday before close is considered pumping.

PTON jumped 2.5% in a few minutes. TSLA $405c went from .5 to 2.2 in a matter of 15 minutes.

Sounds like you are PDT restricted so no Friday FD fun for you. If you can get the account balance up to $25k you can start throwing in random $50 bets before close

Someone remind me to never trade again when I'm out of day trades.
Also, my girlfriend is an epi and agrees with fauci that it's incredibly likely this vaccine is just as effective.

Granted betting on this assumes the market won't just sell right off after news hits. If we're still juicing tomorrow and there's no news I'm leaving all but my lotto spy calls.
You do realize the catalyst for it hitting 40+ was Morgan Stanley 40 PT which got upgraded to 46. 40 is likely the floor.

The dip has been yesterday. Safe for a few more weeks
No production car until 2022 so I‚Äôm guessing 420.69
Omg you got 40k ! You shoulda held onto the bag
I was getting hype about finally dipping into calls on NIO yesterday, but my account wasn't set up for them yet. Laziness won out, and I never finished the process, so I didn't lose all my money.
You should have bought this morning instead
Fuk this Apple going no where. Will this go down?
Lol same
i'm waiting for another vaccine headline to crash PTON more then buy calls 1-month out
After the moderna pump and before the stimulus pump
A Twitter lemon fucked over China harder than a bat did
Not sure so annoying but looks like it‚Äôs really picking up steam now
Hold stronk, we‚Äôll probably see a bit more dip due to mango press conference but then people will remember that the vaccine is still months away no matter what he says and then lockdowns and holidays we‚Äôll be here before you know it.
what the fuck did you think it was going to do? a straight vertical moon shot to $100 by the 20th next week?

jesus you kids are ACTUALLY retarded. this shit is up from $3 to $45 in like 4 months and you all bought calls AFTER the 1000% run and you go "wHy iS iT cRaShInG?"

Only on my bad days
just so the bears know larger orders (orders greater than 100 on ES) have a delta of +6189 into close rn.  Little guys (less than 5 contracts) have delta into the close at -5884.  Delta measures the aggressiveness of buyers and sellers. Do with that information as you would like.
F finishing the week pretty strong
Done. What a piece of shit. Regardless of your position it's pretty much theft what he's doing. Please keep in mind shareholders who are older and not as astute as some of us. The titles on his reports are incredibly misleading. Boatloads of people already reported him. It'll be interesting to see where this goes. Not going to lie the fucker seems interesting though. Sounds like he's living his own movie or some shit.
This stock goes up 2400% in 6 months and you‚Äôre crying over a 15% drop? What he did was equivalent of any market maker upgrading or downgrading stocks. Nio has benefited from plenty of ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù

Sold at open for 100% profit. Buy more 30 minutes before Shitron announcement. Sell at 100% loss. Came out even üòé
haha the rest of the field is gonna rip on him so much lol
They‚Äôve got earnings tue morning, I might jump in
!remind me 10 minutes
This guy did

Nobody cared when you posted this 8 minutes ago
yup

I respect that but aye if I coulda day traded I would pulled a nice k but Na
[deleted]
You can still close you just cant open
Go on Robinhood. Look at PLAY or CCL and see what people who bought these stocks are buying. Realize you should've been shorting these since Monday and then buying calls this morning after moderna announced prelim news yesterday
NIO: ‚ÄúGIVE ME YOUR ENERGY!!!!!‚Äù
 I expect NIO to pump into close then dump hardcore in AH lol
Good luck on your puts next week.
NIO sees the Matrix for what it really is now.
Agreed enough is enough now. Needs a separate forum.
Lmaoo the market rn is like after you‚Äôve already nutted but then she starts to rub your junk again
I‚Äôd üå∞
wtf happened to amzn... the amzn that I sold not 20 minutes ago
Man was between $MU and $SPCE for calls over the weekend think I picked the wrong one.
NIO 70 next week then I can afford my wife‚Äôs bf a house
i mean, u can just miss out i guess
naw my trading strategy is different. I scroll wsb until I see something that catches my eye- might be the use of emojis, might be a shitpost- then I do the opposite of what the third google news result proposes. Got corsair and nio that way
Buy the dip
That‚Äôs even more unlikely
They were all temporary blips too. Guy has to be putting trades on before publishing his materials.
Welcome to advanced derivatives trading and portfolio management. I posted a DD on it before it started really moving üòÇ

A hedge should really be defined as a position that covers your initial cost, so your losses are either 0 or minimized. I also am selling deep OTM iron condors weekly to ensure if vol does decide to pick up, I ain‚Äôt rekted by my credit spread
Big balls. I'm scared of the weekend. 

But fuck it I'm in
Protests will get worse this weekend.

More states will announce increased measures and stay-at-home "orders"

$SPY to $500

Yes
So am I right in saying I could put all my money into a pharma company and get it commission free!
Initiated a position in FSR. 5 calls, 12/17/21 17.5 c. I heard they were using some of that billion dollars they got to hire celebrities and influencers. To the moon baby!
If NIO hits 50 again I‚Äôll double down my short
Plug is opening at 26....
BABA bye bye.. You don't fuck with Winnie the Pooh
Does BABA have more downside from here on out?
Smart move Im getting 11/20 60c
FLGT
20th because after earnings it will have a sell off. You want to sell before earnings because IV.
it's people like you that i think who come up with good ideas
imma go get me some Wendy's
NIO going back up lmao
√ë√é√ñ es muy picante wey
OP prepare your @sshole for the biggest, longest, and girthiest downvote in WSB history !!!!
you are 80% ignorant and 20% retarded.  have you watched a single interview with Elon where is asked technical questions?   The guy is a fucking genius and knows his shit.
NIO puts up 600% to -80% in 1 hour WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT, THE UNDERLYING IS $3 BELOW
He should take a shit on Goldman‚Äôs desk
genuine question. With VIX as low as it is, wouldn‚Äôt that imply stability in the market? To me, with the recent moves in the EV, solar, financial, and MJ markets, it seems a little unstable. 

Seems like it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad time to get into long dated puts as hedges with the low volatility
[deleted]
Liquor
fuck robinhood for auto selling my ITM nio spreads for a loss, i would have been at full profit if they waited
David Ackman and Herbalife. Happens all the time. Make money off the volatility. You will learn to love it.
I close most of my theta positions i made last week, then rewrite them for next Friday, squeezing in that extra day with of premium
NIO and playing earnings. I'm either gonna lose it all or come out of this a bit richer.
Spy pump or dump into close? Place your bets 


Cmon dump bb
See! Like I didn‚Äôt know that was going to happen, but the charts suggested it. TA is some wild shit when it works.
Spy 300 monday
Fucking hell.. listen, bitch, Risk-control shaming is NO LONGER LEGAL
I'd nut. Just bought 100 11/16 365 calls for the lotto play on Monday
Buy into nio again?
Ask Citron for that lol. They made bank
Daily mentions of NIO on WSB was high as fuck and 100% over bullish. Triggered alerts to the big boys to sell and gtfo. Citron was secondary.
This is a terrible idea
pls bezos
idk man I just like rgb lights
In all seriousness, the most loaded guys I know pay cash for 70k+ trucks and dress like hobos.

Is CRSR the next NVDA and AMD?
One more NIO put scalp for the road
Jan 2nd 2020.  I had read up all new years and saw a bunch of articles that mentioned GE.  That morning I was scanning my watchlist at about 10am and noticed that GE hadn't really moved when I was kind of expecting it would gap up.  Options expiring the next day, I placed an order for 100 only 23 (I was wrong about 17) got filled.  GE kept going up 4,500% is where I sold (so $1k profit) but there was a time when it was worth 1500.
The car only speaks mandarin
I feel that I'm really missing out by not FOMO'ing into FSR and SOLO... I don't even want to visit those former bagholders over at r/pennystocks, prolly all happy and snorting coke from hookers asses over there.
Got in at $41 today, now hoping we give it retard strength
So how‚Äôd yah do.
Closing all my shorts and non CC thetas over the weekend now, Monday put the fear of YHWH back in me
RIOT
Seriously, that research piece sank my 0DTE calls
I watched the $47 call i sold drop out of the money just in time for expiration today.

THETA GANG!!!
Because look at those 356‚Äôs
Goldman Sachs metals desk, please.
Opinions on Fisker:
can anyone explain what caused that iv drop on SPCE today?
These NIO comments from this morning aren‚Äôt aging well

there is no 11/16
Position?
Nah real facts though I‚Äôm beating the market by wheeling lol
how many plebs wrote NIO puts for free money and got destroyed today?
What?
yessir
What‚Äôs everyone buying into the weekend?
Yeah. May open some small positions when there's a pull back but it doesn't make sense to be trying to time selling/buying options on shorter contracts. If you had bought it at any point before this week you wouldn't have lost any money during any of the "crashes" that killed options traders.
You‚Äôre so fucked lmao
JKS only goes up
Fucking insane!
[deleted]
You must be super fun at parties
It will when it touches 361 363
Ima blow that man a goodnight kiss. I sold at the tip top my calls and road puts all the way down
I barely made it out on the backside of the surge. Out at 51 as the slide started accelerating. Thing dropped like a brick.
PFE calls and travel stocks or just UDOW if you want to play it safe
No one mention the cousins xpev and li?  They follow the exact same trend.
I sold 45.5 puts exp 11/20 ATM yesterday. Still holding, although I could / should have taken my 40% gains this morning.
BABA needs a pick me up
People shook about mangos press conferences here he‚Äôs about to take credit for the vaccine that‚Äôs going to be out ‚Äúvery soon, so soon that it‚Äôll make your head spin‚Äù

Are you not part of the "majority of the market"?
I bought 1 NIO call For November 27 44C like a few days ago...you can imagine how much I was up this morning..I realized if I bought 20 or 30 more of those I would be rich.. oh btw I held on and now it's back down to almost nothing üòÜüòÜüòÜ
Cash the fuck out and enjoy the weekend üçª
The best investment I can think of for you, or anyone really is paying off my debts :)
I'm going to be marked as a pattern day trader after today.
I'll still have several option orders open.

Will robinhood close them for me automatically?

Or do I have until they expire to *only* sell them?
What ? Left ? As in news media outlets ? That get potentially get incentives to promote specific stocks ? Especially when they took investments prior to making a report about it ? Yeah. That is evil.

Took investments: I‚Äôm inidicating potentially media companies taking investments and promoting prior to releasing the positive information. 

Companies have a list full of different reports on news outlets to get there company out there, good news is bad news
You‚Äôre assuming people here are investing in things they know about
anything but these Chinese car stonks everyone keeps talking about.
When will RKT be a good stonk
Those NIO premiums god damn

NIO recession over?
Bring Luckin back

RELIST OUR TRUE KING

Nio!!!!
CRSR IS UP 3%
I'm fucking getting black out drunk at indoor golf after work if NIO closes green. Actually I will either way but still. Of course I sold at bottom for the day.
Are we done with the paper handing?
Alternatively, one can simply just be Warren Buffett
cuz it mooned 40% lol, u think theres more where that came from? idk brother, what are the catalysts and did they even destroy earnigns like that? nah idts
JP Morgan will raise price target.
We're talking about the stock market at least. Yeah hospitality suffers, and the disconnect is fucked up. But SPY gonna keep on keeping on cause AAPL MSFT NVDA BRK.B etc keep drawing investors
TAN is such a shit stock. Any suggestions for other solar/green energy stocks?
You close to a margin call? I have never had E*TRADE sell a position on me.
PLTR

Would y'all autists hold with a 15 cost basis? Thinking about selling to catch a dip next week.

Alright, I'm done buying NIO options lmao. So much easier to eat those drops and you can average down when it's obvious it will rebound above previous support levels. $40 is the bottom.
Bought NIO at the bottom because there's no way it doesn't run up next week before earnings. Right? RIGHT?!
Actually not bad. Makes sense, there are too many P/E boomers here and they get their panties ina knot when they don't understand anything else other then  year 11 economics.

So wait, you want me to pm you pics of you naked? Not gonna happen, those are treasured possessions.
Short term gonna be hella voilatile. A year later it'll most likely pay off.

So if you're looking for weeklies no, if you wanna go in with shares I'd consider buying in. Or sell some puts.
Didn‚Äôt end up getting in .. which has also turned out to be fortunate

Xi's tiny cock shaped recovery for NIO

Interesting. Why this?

Stay in NIO, it's already bouncing back a bit. After such move it had to correct, but it's still a minor correction compared to the gains of previous dayz.
I sold mine yesterday on nice gains and just bought back in a few minutes ago
P(M) - prior probability that Musk had Covid - assumed to be equal to c (below)

P(M|T) - updated probability given the positive tests

c - proportion of the population with covid antibodies

Tpr - true positive rate

Fpr- false positive rate

P(T) - probability of a positive test result = Tpr\*c+Fpr\*(1-c)

P(T|M) - probability musk tests positive, if he has antibodies = Tpr



Incoming terrible formatting (mobile)

P(M|T) = P(T|M) *P(M)/P(T)

P(M|T) =Tpr\*c/(Tpr\*c+Fpr\*(1-c))

Pick your favorite values for c, Tpr, and Fpr and go to town.
SPY, do it! You know you want to!
Thinking same thing, ba up 5% like what? How‚Äôre you playing things
Why is your screenshot so low res? Puts it is

If nio ends green you know institutions just took advantage of your weak hands.

There is literally no reason the market should be up right now. It is total manipulation. If I lose my 500 in puts not a big deal but the fact that the market can ignore such volatility is ridiculous.
You weren't lying.  YTMND.
dude it's right before earnings. i hate that people are ruining the term diamond hands but yeah, definitely diamond hand because the boomers are just starting to find out about this shit. lotta money left to be made, and fomo to capitalize on.

Forward looking.... atleast 1 vaccine is viable and treatment is FDA approved too.
MRNA 11/16 100C

Cases will rocket over the weekend and Trump will release 120% effective MRNA vaccine news launching the markets to all time highs. Poor people will be mandated to administer doses to the top 5% first or else they get no stimulus.
Love TD. Being able to call somebody and talk to them instantly too is nice.

NIOs volume is at 525m. Its avg volume is 133m, the whole market is trading NIO.
If we can‚Äôt beat them, can we profit off of them? Buying calls/puts in relation to the news before the majority of the market can react?
Imagine using 40% of your portfolio to average down on 0dte NIO calls and then missing your break even limit sell by 0.02
Agreed, moon mission incoming

Nope, IMAO

why? I have calls

I think I know what‚Äôs going on. Investors are excited about MRNA releasing positive vaccine news and are buying up reopening stocks expecting a day like monday this week
smart man. NIO is about to make the next wave of NIKOLA bagholders. hate to see it.
Watch a rally next week cucks
You just bought puts when it dropped 15%? That figures why you‚Äôre up only 7%. Sell that shit today or you‚Äôll lose it all come Green Monday
[deleted]
No stop this nonsense. Nio is our ticket to tendie town and no little citron fuckhead üåàüêª is going to stop that. Buy that shit ASAP before this next rocket takes off. I‚Äôll miss you at the top. Look what that fuck boy tried to do to Shopify last year? Who‚Äôs laughing now? All the bag holders. Stocks only go one way
No matter how bad you feel, just know thst there is probably someone out there who blew their life savings buying NIO at $53 at x4 day trading leverage...

Let's go Nio. We tasted the bottom but now its back to the top. I'll never give up on you no matter what those Fuckers at Citron say about you. you're #1 in my book.
Mine are for 2022 so I‚Äôll hang on, but I went from up about 30% to down now 25% so quickly for a leap.

Theta plays against it have made it slightly less bad, when it was kangarooing a couple weeks back selling the green days and closing the red days was free money
What are the plays before close? Go on.
NIO $60 by EOD
Brazil competes with America for $$$. When the dollar gets stronger Brazil gets weaker, and Brazil gets stronger when the dollar gets weaker.  You have to think about inflation, exchange rates(yuan->Brazil currency~>yuan~>dollar). Everyone is selling their goods to China so the yuan exchange rates are what it will depend on.
lol justin thomas just told SVP "i love you" live on air

NIO bulls this is your chance to cut your losses. Take it from a GNUS veteran, this always ends one way
Yes, certain brokerages allow that option.
it's funny cuz they both were and are. Fundamentals don't really matter anymore though, particularly in a market dominated by millions of autists like us.

Does anyone even have AAPL anymore.
Whats your positions?
This is the thing . Is nio hyped af ? Yes! But you look at it from this perspective, China is backing them , the rush for electric cars is similar like the rush for internet companies in the 90s, however were a couple years away from the pop. Imo. Untill it comes time that people actually start buying electric and we can compare sales it comes down to hype. I‚Äôd be surprised if nio is successful but right now that‚Äôll make you some money.

It‚Äôs also comparable to the weed rush last year but those companies had legal headaches which stunted everything.
‚ÄúSerious investors‚Äù lol imagine that
Dude NIO ran up based off Morgan Stanley 40 price target they changed to 45/46. I would sell. It probably has a price floor around 41. Any lower people buy.
better see some gain porn or ban

Please NIO. Hit 45
Did you sell...? Its just a number until you do
Pumpers pump
What the fuck is nio and why will no one on this sub stfu about it
Bought puts this week and got wrecked sooo... who fucking knows
NIO floor is 40. Buy now or FOMO.
Why is this shit pumping when I bought puts reeeeeeee
dont do it, this thing looks pinned at $15.50, the MMs want the $16 calls to be worthless. mooning next week though, position for that
as well as IVR (a lot o free money in max a year), investing in the spac called pcpl is truly free money... u can buy at 10 and some change, and cuz its a spac, it will not go below 10 bucks for u, as long as u bought the spac and not the stonk, like nikola
No.

&#x200B;

Bro the CEO of Pfizer legit sold a big chunk of stock right after announcing the efficacy of the vaccine, no one gives a shit about market manipulation anymore, which sucks but it is what it is. In a way, all of these "analysts" and "research firms" are already market manipulation, because when such and such fuckface analyst or such and such firm announce they've issued a price target that's inherently influencing a huge number of people one way or another. I mean yeah they have to disclose their positions if they have them but still. It's amazing to me that people are actually out there believing in the legitimacy of market research coming from a place where it'll legit say "short seller" in the title.

They're doing this right before earnings which are expected to be really impressive (relative) and realistically they're probably gonna profit off the short and then hop back in and ride the earnings wave.

Why does everyone sell NIO just because some idiot said its over valued? We could have been at 60 today!
They are the Canadian companies! How's trulieve, Green thumb, curaleaf, Cresco, harvest revenue looks like. Your lookin at Canadian companies, and sayin the American ones can't make it work. These stocks have been climbing without you, and most have price targets double, triple what they are now. 

Im not arguing with you, im tryin to let you know. The Canadians are unprofitable, yes. The MSO's are, you can be bearish on it, but I'll have to disagree.
He probably deleted all his shit posts that didn‚Äôt pan out if I had to guess
How have you kept your $20k when one little tweet can sink you?
No one is selling because its about to rip.  Bid higher.
what in the fuck
Citron is notorious for shorting stocks and releasing bad press, the profiting off of it. Left was banned for 5 years from trading in China because of his market manipulation. 

What he is doing is illegal, and I'm surprised he can still keep doing it.

Especially since the stock dropped after a baseless claim that was only a paragraph long.
That screenshot says he's lost 1.8M. This is less a matter of debate and opinion and more just the picture.
$54
Imagine buying NIO at $8 a contract for the 50 strike expiring next week, OOF
hold these itm NIO puts?
What does this even mean? Any other stock or DKNG?
Just fucking dump SPY. You know you want to before this shit show of a weekend.

Guess we all buying back into nio since it skyrockets every pre market Monday
I‚Äôm trying to buy. :(
With all these accusations of assumptions and avoiding the question I think you're confusing me with the other guy you're talking to. I just asked what makes you think that it's not connected to the military. I think the part I wasn't clear on is that I think it's a moot point either way because it has more to do with politics than actually being connected to the military. Companies will be blocked for political reasons.

I‚Äôm not ready to get burnt again
I used to research, chart, and spend like 3 hours a day on this shit.  Took my account $600 - > $17k -> $20.  Gave up.

For VIX 22 is a massive lava. Since April, every time it dropped to 22, it jumped right back up.
If you guys are looking for another EV company, SOLO actuslly held up really well with the sell-off today, still up over 20%. Disclaimer that I own <100 shares.
Exactly. Today was a great day to go shopping; everything I wanted was on sale.
I‚Äôve been in and out about 6 times today. Currently up about 1k sitting on 30 11/20 46/48p credit spreads

Thinking that‚Äôs a solid play at some point next week. Just gonna set a sell and (try to) not look
Wow, the $22 sell wall for SPCE is insane. This things gonna rip next week after this contract expires and they let the price go back up
I trade $20K at a time just to make ~$20-50. AMA
Doubled down when it started rebounding. My original cost basis is like 16 so fuck it. I cashed out of 1/15 40C this morning near the top, now I'm in for 50C march and also sold a 35$ put. Let's hope this is the bottom....
I bet they sold then shorted then got fucked. So they needed to drop price to cut smaller losses.

Anyone playing NVDA for earnings?  Looks like its primed for a run up next week
You might as well buy 15 uvxy stock for the same price you bought a weekly option. Spy call? I buy it, but will sell as soon as it turns into a +100% profit/Monday. I do like the play overall if you went uvxy stock and spy calls because it would be a reverse inverse leverage(double negative). Just stupid enough where it might work and you can time the markets right.
Feels fucking good to lose?
How tho everything seems so bullish

Edit: unless you wanna count your AMD post which you were wrong about
XPEV
check your emotions, regroup, get back in their.
They sell based off stupid rumor to buy back. It ran up based on Morgan Stanley 40 to revised 46 price target. 40 is the floor. Many sold probably to buy back cheaper but FOMO if it hit near 40.
Very fucking interesting.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. NY is closing a lot of businesses today and the mayor of NYC already told parents to prep for school closures starting Monday. At some point, other major cities might follow suit.
I had NIO 47p expiring today, and sold at 45. Biiiiig regrets.
Bought 380 shares for $14.44, bought more yesterday at $44 and more today on this dip. I said it would go above $45 and now I say it will go to $1000 a share otherwise my wife's boyfriend hits me with the hose and makes me sleep outside
50 mins left, not even Nio can pull that
Tickers?

Yeah I had $7 calls expiring 12/15 I sold last month the second I broke a profit again. About to delete it off my watchlist so I dont have to see it keep going up

boys, IVR is the recovery wave... if you dont have a massive amount of cheap calls, how will you ever be like that gme guy
What? Energy sector up, health sector up, consumer staple up, consumer disc up, industrial sector up. How would spx not go up?
I had to get out of NIO. Bought shares Wednesday so managed to come out even. Kinda sucks I didnt sell earlier today but this stock isn't worth it anymore. Ill buy back in for the next meme stock when it comes around.
Could go up, could go down. Anyone who tells you it‚Äôs not gambling is lying
I have kcac (shares) should I hold long term? Have about 14 average price
you know you could sell the nearest strike call with the same expiration to lock in the profits/loss right?
You're no fun.
Biggest dip I‚Äôve seen so far. Definitely a great time to buy. I guarantee you the market will rebound HARD next Monday. Even if it‚Äôs like 3%, that‚Äôs a gain nonetheless. I just bought 20 more shares.
Anyone long on GME?
Or the big guys can buy in the after hours and us peons have to wait until Monday‚Äôs opening...
I sold my spy calls for .17 cents today.. they're worth 1.70 now.

You're returns won't be great but you'll be around forever I guess. I'd look for better margins on a collapse like that though
u timed the top, and I timed the bottom... we going to be flat rofl

#Can't stay flat
Idk if that‚Äôs a metaphor but my cock is indeed out
HSBC said the same thing. Fortunately I‚Äôm cynical and was sure it would reverse. I was right, although I may have sold out early($18.40-24.40). No regrets because 33% in 2 weeks off of stocks is not a bad turn around at all. Original plan was to hold until brexit but I liked the 1 day 10% pop.
People asking others to make their gambling choices are annoying. We‚Äôre not telling you if the dice are going to land on snake eyes or a hard 8. 

If you don‚Äôt sell yourself on your own investing idea, you have TP hands when it comes to payday.
buy yourself something nice tbh
RIP. Sorry bro.
Should I buy nio or xpev on the dip now or don't touch at all until next week? Looking for good honest  advice
they just realllly want this shit stock to pump
In for the long ride baby üí∞üéâ

So is NIO just in correction mode or is this a bubble bursting event for the Chinese EV sector?
do I diamond hand my puts rofl
Yeah, they both involve a butt, so they're hard to distinguish between.
Neither?
Thank you.. but they will not stop print in the future.. so this can go on for years.. but a crash may occur.. the stock market can stay flat.. with new lockdown coming and no stimulus it think it will a least correct
Lol covid coming back strong doesn't matter, what matters is how the stupid airlines behave related to it.

i've been traveling the whole time during covid, been on over a dozen flights since it began, and the only issue for airlines right now is them being fucked cowards and trying to pander to the media and government. The airlines that don't give a fuck are packed to the brim and nobody gives a fuck. I don't give a fuck either, and I've had covid as has most people who are still traveling around.

The US could go full boot-stamp society and airlines boom if they don't shut down flights or enforce distancing rules on them. The worst it is domestically the more people will be willing to pay for a ticket out, so really this should be prime-time for them.
Running a little hot right now, but as we have seen with the other EV stocks this year, that may not matter one bit. Really like what I‚Äôm seeing in my research with fisker and their designs are incredible. Already taking preorders from the sounds of it and Rumors of an announcement from company this weekend. I took a flyer on it today with a few grand into May 2021 20c. It Could be a great runner going forward. Cramer routinely pumps this one over NIO as well (for whatever that is worth). I could totally see all the NIO fanboys moving here in the next few weeks. American company so you know Biden is gonna support them with the clean energy agenda.
Tell you what. A ton of you motherfuckers are swimming with no pants on. Gonna get ugly next couple months.
God damn, why can‚Äôt my CRSR calls execute? Can somebody please respond

COVID cases out of control, Chicago talking about lockdowns, NYC planning to go back to fully distanced learning by Monday, Midwest hospitals at capacity and no slowdown in new cases. So, calls
SBE before it merges with ChargePoint or KCAC before it merges with QuantumScape. Both easy money
That volume on NIO is insane
Large amounts of put being bought by hedges. So Calls.

jeez mayne, y not take loss, exit and buy dip on monday in an actual company, with leaps? when qqq recovers, ur new position should grow way more...and yes im from the future and q's will dump on monday and maybe tuesday...we will hear from moderna and theyve got some stupid news, gonna rock the market
Anybody launching vix calls?
U can selling ass behind Wendy. Free tax
Just make sure and take profits before they become losses ;)
Would y‚Äôall hold kcac long term if I got shares, or is this ev stuff all hype and just take profits and run
Puts. We‚Äôve been in a trading range since beginning of September, currently near the top. With COVID spiking exponentially and no apparent positive catalyst, think we pull back over the next couple weeks to the mid to lower end of the trading range. Low end around 325. Bounce if we get there.
fuck citron, all my homies hate citron.
Anyone else have a tangled web of rkt spreads?

I'll lick your sister's taint if NIO closes green.
Fuck I think it's gonna be more then that forsure when COVID grabs us and Biden locks us down which his advisors seem to favour. SPY 280-300 maybe. JPOW will print but it'll dip too hard to catch for a bit.

not gonna happen with the fed clearly in control, best case scenario for bears is a 10% drop, the fed intervened at SPY 320 so thats your market floor
> That being said, it's pretty scary that this thing can tank 20% from today's high with one analyst opinion....

Oh yeah, for sure. I'm long NIO (May and further expiry's) and was already sitting on a nice profit and did expect something like this to happen, just not tank 20%. Earnings should definitely be interesting.
The big boys probably, AMZN, AAPL, Etc, basic, but the truth
what the actual fuck is pumping spy? I get Dow being up but SPY? Nothing is moving
Yes!
Ok guys. I bought 1 share of TSLA üòÇ
fuck it, buying just a lil bit of NIO stock to say fuck you to Left
Looks like a p*nis
I think it's the continuous sell-off the the stay at home as the market rotates.
This thread is like cancer during the day.
This is some quality DD right here. Buying the dip.
$ROPE with a few extra steps
Yeah, been scouting it for a bit. Saw a solid offer on DoC this morning so snagged it up. Hoping to save all these benefits for travel once COVID passes in a year or so.
So NIO opening at $30ish Monday
But, if you knew that it was the top today, then you can see the future, meaning you must know what to tell me

no it really isnt lol
Doubled my position at 50

Kill me

I would guess it‚Äôs just rotation back after a couple of days of reversal. From what I have read, Moderna‚Äôs interim results are still a couple weeks away.
Oh shit chicago locked down let's sell some stocks.

Was originally planning on a long term play with this. Pulled some profits off at 50 and just bought in at same amount. 

Days like today are what you make of them.

Well I am
Fuck man.

I was buying NIO @ $2 I didn't keep trading because I had zero tendie money.

Feels bad man.
Quantitative easing dumped a lot of money onto the market, interest rates killed bonds, and investors are generally being very forgiving for businesses that will likely make it through all of it (case in point, Disney)
IWM calls
And how the fuck are you supposed to know if you need one from a rapid test if the rapid test failed 50% of the time? I NEVER said any of the shit you just accused me of. Nice attempt of a character attack. It‚Äôs getting a bit old though, don‚Äôt you think?

Selling NIO puts EOD
Don't buy weeklies unless you want to get IV crushed. January or later calls should be fine.
I‚Äôm new myself but no, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dead. There was definitely a bubble pop but it‚Äôs a growing company in a promising market. You shouldn‚Äôt have too much to worry about ‚Äî long term. Personally I‚Äôm staying out at least until Tuesday morning though. Then I‚Äôll test the waters and see what sentiment for the earnings call is like.
If NIO ends green, I will name my firstborn child after them.
I‚Äôd sell. I‚Äôd be bummed if it tanked ER for some reason. But I‚Äôm kind of a pussy
SPY calls
yes, and a number 8 please. white rice.
I made 3k this week working and lost 1k on TQQQ calls. I don't know why I bother with options any more I should just buy boomer stocks. Or drugs.
Yes.
makes 0 sense, hopefully it does something next week
dont come here and talk about ur shares u pussio
Calls on SPY and UVXY. Bullish.
Yo bro what happened to my golden goose LI?
Damn, got too greedy on a NIO entry. Was aiming for 40.22 and just missed the bottom :/

In at 42.21 instead.
Because it was up 40% in the last two days, Pretty healthy pull back honestly
The problem with NIO is that Tesla is better.   


However, I agree the stock isn't going to suddenly crash and is likely going to be worth a lot as a second tier Chinese Tesla in the future.
Good work.
cant wait for the EOD pump to 360. Hoping to open Monday at 370 on good Moderna news.
Zm puts
You just posted this. It‚Äôs going to fall enough for you to panic sell before it moons in a couple years.
Congrats and fuck you
Mango is literally irrelevant
Y‚Äôall buying anything now?
what do you like about GM?   Peloton might have room for a retracement - some of these valuations seem high but as long as rates are zero tech stocks will keep momentum to the upside...until market sentiment completely shifts.  Thanks for the picks.

XPENG ftw, half the market cap or NIO
fuck me over traded today... was up now down rofl... with shitty plays
Definitely pretty fishy to release a report days before earnings that basically just says "nio stock too high imo" based on no news, when we could've had a lot information in a few days.

If you're long NIO though, this should be expected, the run up was no sustainable. Shits still up 100% for the month. FOMOers that are looking for a quick buck carried this up. That being said, it's pretty scary that this thing can tank 20% from today's high with one analyst opinion....
I meant PLTR/BABA calls or shares and GLD puts, sorry

The expectation is for Airbnb's traditional ipo to be a mispricing shitshow similar to SNOW. Possibly worse since Airbnb is clouded by virus risk.



Raising privately + direct listing seems like a better play. Could do partial or no lockup. Or direct list and issue a convertible or secondary offering depending where it trades. Traditional ipo seems least appealing.

Rotation is a head fake, rug pull monday. chicago just locked down
Whats that
Excuse me sir this is a USA
If you look at charts over larger time frames and not just weekly or YTD, NIO's growth charts aren't unreasonable. Probably some algo manipulation and a lot of panic selling/profit taking from all of the hype that's making it so volatile but the volume on NIO is insane and majority of shares are still owned by institutions. It's around +2% for the week now and +226% for 3M isn't out of line with what some other stocks have managed to pull off this year. BTFD
No doubt, no doubt.

But seriously though, fuck them. What's the point of short companies like Citron? What do they *actually* contribute to the market as a whole. They can take my gay ass dick and choke on it the motherfuckers.
Are we gonna have a problem here? Haha
Robinhood is currently beta testing options 2.0, apparently some traders have the original version replaced. Check your email to see if you‚Äôve made the beta list you lucky bastard
Bought NIO and XPENG near top early morning. Sold near bottom today. Just head to grieve. Only had 3 shares of each, so could have been waaaay worse
you bitch I got all happyand its up only 1% go fuk urself, 1% isnt MO0O0O0O0O0ONING
Lmao
Same question
Can NIO's earnings really be that good? They don't have as many sales/vehicle deliveries as I would have thought. Sell the news?
4House
I bought today knowing nothing about the stock just because there was a spicy meme I liked about it on here earlier.
Chinese Government will buy this dip AH/monday on NIO.

70 Eow Next week
Nah they will drop and everything else will moon
I cashed out at $5000. Not bad for today.
There is already the precurser with the Taiwan tensions. China will lean on Biden, because he's a weak bitch . War within the next 4 years

I just like your DD and wanted to be able to follow all your posts if you were on there.
So many downvotes.  So many snowflakes in this subreddit.
I gained ¬£100 and lost ¬£200 in one day on my shares. Mental day. Not even playing options
Yes please
Perhaps.. or maybe they gonna short too.. who knowns
I hope it does too. I'm holding 1000 shares at $13.66 cost basis and I want a massive sell-off to fuck with the people betting on it. This stock will hit and remain above $50 within the next few months, but I want people to get fucked before it happens.

Please so I can finally exit that position lol
Karma will come back to get you üòú
COVID time : you need some laugh ... go to Wallstreetbets!
Minor pullback on NIO today due to algos overreacting to a useless Citron piece....gonna hit the stratosphere next week after earnings
If you think about it, our stock market can‚Äôt crash it‚Äôs the only thing to show the world for. We‚Äôre now #1 globally in corona cases, still massive unemployment, and a contested presidential election. The market is our only savior folks
Clitron can't stop us

I guess the rotation into Zoom starts Monday?
CRSR üöÄ
praying bruh
I mean I‚Äôm just going off of the chart, looks like it‚Äôs going up. It‚Äôs not exactly a sure thing lol.
Pretty likely to gap up. But no guarantees, entirely depends on sentiment.
I‚Äôve never traded Nio but seen here just go up and up until this pullback. Jump in or na?
[removed]
I sold right before the dip, something told me this shit was gonna crash
Nobody listening anymore
I've officially renamed Nio the peanut butter falcon. The big goofy headed fuck Andrew Left may have the power to knock it down but Nio has the retard strength to push through and yeet his dumbass from the ring
I'm watching it drop wishing I had more free money to buy more shares üò´
Puts on my memefolio -80% NIO bought this morning ü§°
What position do bears like getting stuck in the best? I just want to make this last power hour pleasing for everyone

CRSR better get in now
i've pooped so hard i've split my butthole a few times. it's called an anal fissure which i find to be a funny name. can be painful/irritating tho
Citron was just having fun with a little insider trading. I hope they get investigated
More like NIO call holders getting bukkake by theta gang.
maaaaaan fuck RH, I‚Äôm locked in for my puts and calls
Fuck Clitron. Don't listen to that BS DD. NIO has the power of china, GOING ALL IN BOYS!

For real. There are some seriously FB-for- teenagers level shit here
You got me

Wow. I‚Äôll give it to you, you actually got me to read this whole thing. Fuck you.
I‚Äôll be praying for lockdowns or something
there is always something worth living for
Made me light way too hard
RIOT and MARA about to MOON..get on it now
Honestly wouldn't shock me if it goes crazy next week
Going to buy some at 3:50
Yeah Nio let‚Äôs go back up bby
This guy is serious, you better listen to him.
Im playing Wday and low. Catching on this rip.
Your good
Had the same thought
Did NIO earnings leak?  Bring me that fucking horizon!
More like there is nowhere else to put money.
cause it has a market cap of 500m, not some utopian 80B. Also it hasnt gone 2500% in a year. Do you people actually look at tickers before asking shit?
Are ya winning boys?

Bears hold tight, next week we eatin
Pton puts free money
I fucking hope so I‚Äôve been in school watching it go down the whole day losing tendies :(
Chinese government daddy has infinitely deep pockets to pump money into green technologies...
60 ATH and 55 as consolidation if the mainstream market articles cover it correctly.
Yeah i guess. Earnings will clutch. I might sell a kidney to boost buying power before
Maybe after it pumps to 60 for earnings
LOL literally half of the float of in trading volume for NIO. Way over sold. Citron probably needed it to dump to exit a short position cheaper before run up after earnings.
When expire?
Ahhh that makes sense thanks
why is PTON drilling today?
I'm a NIO bull but once you get to OP's delusional state of posting about his 'insider info' about them crushing ER is a huge red flag. 

&#x200B;

Puts it is.
What's going on? These $SPY pumps are insane. Controlled buying putting in new floors
ü§°
I bought SPY poots bcoz low volume now I regret it. This is like the 10th time SPY is ruining my weekends.
Mango man speaks this afternoon, which  vaccine manufacturers are going to be pumped?
Says I need shares
Lol look at that spike at start of week
SE will be a meme here the second it reaches 250. Until then, it‚Äôs all ours
Who is holding spy 11/16 puts over weekend üôâ
The death of nio was greatly overestimated
SPY is so fucking suspect right now

[https://thenope.info/](https://thenope.info/)

\^ if you know you know
Yeah so you could just see all the NIO posts
you better be right i want my tendies back
This is me üòÇüòÇüò≠üòÇüòÇ
I saw it up 8% and I was thinking of buying a $200 YOLO put expiring today. I checked an hour later and it was down 8% I couldn‚Äôt believe it lol. Can‚Äôt be mad though there was probably 80% chance my yolo would have expired worthless.
citron cashed out, back up we go boys
Something is up. New covid highs daily...more lockdowns annouced today...and yet the market is powering up. All except covid stocks that is. Most of the stay at home stocks are down while the open the economy stocks are up.

This makes no sense...

Unless...

Some pretty big news is coming next week. Has to be on a vaccine. Possibly more on Pfe and Mrna...
Peloton has been beat down a ton this week. I could see it going back up another 10$+ next week. Also GM could pop
ZM been consolidating for more than an hour now. About to explode (can be up or down)
If you didn‚Äôt know that the EV top was today idk what to tell you
THIS IS A CASINO
MRNA calls theyre gonna announce vaccine results and moon monday
Tech rally to end the day?
Rando‚Äôs on wsb claiming to have bullish insider info... ya I‚Äôll stay short calls no problem
amat calls, amc puts, maybe ftch puts but i feel like this guy could still have sum juice left after earnings today, gm puts, jus throwing ideas around what y‚Äôall think
Are you lost? click here r/ihavesex
Last chance to get in on NIO
And wrong three times in one day
yeah please switch to NIO puts, see how well that works out for you over the weekend when gyna sees this big buy opportunity
Let me tell you the story of NIO. A stock once loved by all was corroded by a tiny dick analyst who just loves to see stocks fall. While everyone laughed at those who impulsively and with greed bought FDs and calls at the top, it was those who stayed silent with their shares and leaps that truly reaped the day. By the middle of 2021, NIO had reached 100, a level no one thought was attainable so quickly. Boys, its time to gather your eggs, put them into nio leaps/shares, hold on tight, and get ready for a stock that will one day make your wallet fat and leave your wife‚Äôs boyfriend packing his bags.
Thanks, you too panda
V shape recovery coming for NIO
Damn NIO really fucking tanking. That‚Äôs a bold strategy Cotton
Hahaha... yea, me neither...
Everyone visualizing what you said is the funny part lmfao
guys, you wanna pump IVR again like we did in june?
My main concern is that most of tech I‚Äôm following is red, but Nasdaq been going up almost all week, which means when Nasdaq does decide to dump hard then these tickers shit some more.
Zoom loss covered with Nio Put.. could have had a huge green dildo
"LiKe 4ChAn FoUnD a BlOoMbErG tErMiNaL"
I bought XPEV calls at the bottom today boys. Did I finally do something right?
i'd tweet, but i don't tweet., this company has a potential to reach the strike price at the date of expiration. we just need one news article and we're mooning. also \[earnings soon\]‚Ñ¢
Shhh. Don‚Äôt ask questions. 

It‚Äôs keeping me in the green.
I have leaps too but don't know when the gridlock with xi will end for it to move up
I think very... I bought stock at 270 and sold today at 282 because as much as I wanted to hold on for a return to ~500 it seems that NFLX has lost it's shine atm.
Those NIO puts would‚Äôve printed now
happy cake day dawg
I sleep well every night knowing that commie covid doomer bears get gaped everyday buying puts because ‚Äúcases‚Äù
Thanks!  Can‚Äôt wait to collect these tendies
well shit
V shaped nio recovery
Wrong. It‚Äôs only for you dummies that aren‚Äôt listening to the 120+ people he keeps around him that will sell their soul to CNN for a quick blowjob and $5 drinks at The Bird
Dow dumps Monday - you heard it here first.
Sell puts at a lower strike to lock in Profits . Then try to close the spread Monday for the remaining profits
It‚Äôll look way better next week. But like someone said on another post, NIO ain‚Äôt no Tesla, so don‚Äôt expect that shit. Get out when you‚Äôre up enough, pussy
[deleted]
People buying again because they realize  Citron‚Äôs ‚Äúbuying letters on a screen‚Äù comment is exactly what we‚Äôve been doing all along.

Nice shit yo.
Come on power hour
I‚Äôm down -63k so it‚Äôs all good
Still amazed Citron put that bullshit out 3 days before earnings report. Sold my call at the bottom like a bitch for +16% because now the whole ER run up is in jeopardy and a good ER might not even be good enough to save the calls because IV crush is so fucking big.

Hope you Kings do well, as soon as I sold it went up, that was for you. You guys can still make tendies but now there‚Äôs too many X factors for me to hold, all cuz Andrew Left that lurking pussy

Cashgang has been asking for a dip. Here ya go, boys!
I am, I like making money
Man this sub fucking sucks now. Only the daily threads are worth any time
Low volume pumps hurt too much.
Too much buzz about lockdowns for me. Buying some longer dated UVXY calls and selling on a bump. I doubt  we get anything as bloody as March but I think we have a sell off between now and December
Pls pwr hour save us in these desperate times
11/16 353p at 358?
down 400 one day, up 400 the next. no real news just clown shoes
Did I just buy NIO puts at the bottom?
These artificial pumps are funny, like nobody is fucking buying except computers and level 2 data is bullshit ran by market makers that spoof orders all day

I bought the dip, but probably will shit the bed even more
NIO opened at 51 went up to 54 back to 42 all in single trading session. Perfection.
Sold 70$ CCs on the meme stock this morning. I mean I'm down like several thousand today but at least I collected some premium?
i predict FSR will drop on Monday because all announcements result in dips but then i predict FSR will go up after that
Yeah looks like it
Are you a 75 year old man? Have you not heard of screenshots?
Luv is safest. But as a long term bet. I dunno if for yolo

Smart man
i think the nio autists are safe, just some major profit taking
I wouldn‚Äôt be that surprised lmao
ALGORITHMS: I am buying a $SPY put. This means I am expecting SPY to go down. It would be awful if spy were to go up. I would have to quit the stonk market.
tuesday
Yeah that just means a crap-ton of people either don't know the Fed is protecting the bond market or these are hedges from investment firms as opposed to us just trying to make a quick buck.  "Because everyone else is doing it" isn't DD.

The sacred texts lied to us!
Fuck Citron, wsb has spoken this shit's going to the moon. Buying more stonk on this dip, what a glorious opportunity to get more before it moons above 100  

All hail supreme leader of chicken fried tendies, NIO with more cars being produced at this stage of their creation than TSLA. TSLA is for the older millennials who didn't have a father figure growing up
This is probably a noob question but how do you come to your numbers?

Complicated story but I came into possession of $25,000 of my parents money that I was not supposed to do anything with and yesterday I put it on NIO calls against their knowledge expecting to double it and have them never notice.  Now I am extremely scared and don‚Äôt know wtf to do now that NIOs down. My life is kind of fucked if NIO doesn‚Äôt recover soon
Is there a way to check this? Are they required to post what they buy anywhere?

APHA already pumping today! More to come next week!

When will tech moon again? Asking for a friend

Algo‚Äôs are having a fun day mooning for no reason
https://imgur.com/gallery/vCQY9oz oh well
I wouldn‚Äôt blame bears if they started the throw up right now this is gonna get disgusting

Âà´ÂÆ¢Ê∞î
RIP means res...nvm
Yeh I've been yoloing my full account everytime and went from 3K - 30k - 2k - 17k - 54k...and now I may yolo it all for puts... not too sure.
put an f in the chat for me boys ü•¥
That‚Äôs not how it works, it needs call holders contracts to expire worthless before it begins the road upwards again
[deleted]
Even though I believe the pullback makes sense, I still believe NIO might have a run up to earnings. Might pick up a few random calls
Can anyone give me a reason to not invest in PFE rn?
Same thing hapenned with SHOP
POMP EET
Same here. I can feel his joy!
[deleted]
alright wtf is up with square?!!
BA puts anyone?
Agreed. I think the market at large is just realizing that it is indeed overvalued in the short term.
850 peak running so far almost got margin called
Unclear. It's run up a LOT so it was asking for a big pullback. That being said it's dropped like 20% from today's ridiculous high sooooo...it's also had athat huge pullback. But it's still up 100% in a month so.....plus earnings is coming up.

Tbh I'd say just don't buy any options on this thing right now. The IV is insane AND earnings is Tuesday. The potential swing in either direction is huge.

If you're confident in a direction, maybe sell the voilatility and take advantage of high premiums, otherwise don't bother.
Don‚Äôt.
so annoyed

spy/nasdaq all up, my biggest holdings AMZN, TSLA , AAPL are red
Its just on sale today. Nio day next week dont forget. Double down
I MEANT TO BUY NIO 41 12/4c  AND I FUCKED UP AND BOUGHT IT AS A PUT NOOOOOOOOOOO

What was it
where‚Äôs the gain post
Wow i was way off.  Called top of NIO at 5am...didnt happen until 5 hours later.  "NIO is not a meme stock, NIO is the one that is different" ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ

Sorry to those that lost today, but how did you not see consolidation coming when every body and their grandmas were posting about the same fucking stock for 72 hours straight.
The only reason why its down today is that someone pulled out early...never pull out early
Lmao
Moderna is going to announce likely early next week and the market is back to pricing it in. Literally all anyone had to do this week was buy puts on Boomer shit and then sell and buy calls today
NIO Mooning before close. It's happening.
But its starting to go up now
2k
Anyways.... may I direct your attention to BABA
amazon stonk split could literally end world hungerüôÑ
Wish I would have sold my NIO calls at the top if only because I could have bought back in at the bottom and had a lot of spare cash.
Smash that mf'n BUY button üëäüèªüëäüèª
They make vodka so they matter.
Imagine buying it this morning there were ppl here saying they bought calls when it was over 52 lol hahaha
I mean to the people who are waiting for the dip. This is the perfect time to load up. God damn you guys are lucky those Citron bastards came out with that article today. Also today is just why reason why option plays are incredibly dangerous.

GLTA
It's okay, the 1.6m retards here will buy the dip. They'll be complaining this time next year that it drops when the earnings come out. I guess as long as 1.6m retards buy it every time, it stays up.
wtf is up
He was holding shorts. It was confirmed. This isn't even the first time Citron pulled this shit.

How are you using those connections? They‚Äôll talk to most referrals to tech companies, so you‚Äôve got to be specifically asking for referrals to jobs. 

Also, look up certifications. You don‚Äôt have to even have it yet‚Äî put it on your resume and say you‚Äôre pursuing it so it catches in keyword searches. Just so you‚Äôre not being this honest, you should definitely actually get that though

The fact that China has said they are going electric. Plus it didn‚Äôt jump 50% in 1 day. Lol.
NIOs euphoria lasted 1week, lowest of any meme stock.
If they announce signing a deal with a gov agency to track covid, yeah. Chances that goes public though, we‚Äôll see.

Can't say ticker, low market cap. They make these funky pop culture toys with weird shaped heads for kids.

I'm actually thinking about this too myself.

For context used Datadog a lot in my job as software engineer.
Their product was decent but really had trouble scaling to bigger loads so I often ended up replacing it with heavier duty in-house stuff. (this is actually my specialty, distributed time-series and event storage systems).

However recently I have been feeling a change in the engineering culture over there, they are picking up some very very good engineers and pumping out blog posts and open-source software that really shows they know what the fuck they are doing now.

When my next deposit lands I will probably take a long position in DDOG.

Riding on $1000 gain as of now, scared of pattern day trader shit so can't close them today :-(
It was up 120% this month and maybe was due for a correction?
If you have NIO calls, just sell it. Itll be a massive correction to the actual value of the company.
im holdin too, hnnnnggggggggggggg
But they all said it would go up? How can everyone be wrong? People can‚Äôt lie on here I think that‚Äôs illegal

Reminds me of Battery day as well
Dont look
BABA janurary calls.
Cuz it ran up a fuck ton recently and all the wsb retards have been schilling it all week. This happens everytime
# Breaking news, 

NIO vehicles are just TSLA cars that didn't pass inspection, and resold at a discount with a sticker that says made in gyna
I jacked off twice to NIO today.

Once when my calls printed and once when my puts printed
Gonna try to sink the market. Comes out coughing and sneezing. Looking like he's on death's door and screaming that PFE and MRNA vaccines cause autism in adults.
does it really matter when they pump back up Monday PH? Still learning
okay my guy, I bot 4/21 7.50C for 70cents a pop today, hope you're right
I'll see all you retards next week when it moons again
Happy buying the dip today, will keep buying if it drops at any point
#HYG put option
Should have fully cashed out but stayed in a bit like retard
Haven‚Äôt touched the Chinese EVs yet considering NIO call rn how retarded is that 1-10
Yes $59
May his memory live on!
Huh? Jan 12 ATVI $70.36, December 14 atvi $47.75 (2018)

(23 bucks down)

Jan 2019 $47 - December 20 $59
(12 bucks up)

What graph are u looking at? A leap would have to be well timed to not just get recked by theta
WSB might as well be renamed NIO for the day. Holy shit this place it litup with NIO discussions.
If that‚Äôs $22 and not $22k show us some screen shots. My nuts are growing just thinking about it üí¶üí¶üí¶

frown harder and it will happen
Good point
More rewarding than shares, and less likely to be decimated by a short term dip.
It‚Äôs supposed to be ironic because I slay so much pussy

It hit ath and people take profits
Wrong sub. Nobody cares about your McDonald‚Äôs money
Citron is a bitch.
Almost
Oh shit nio mooning
it prolly will tbh, u should get cheap calls that have been iv crushed
Look at citron on Twitter, they sell shorts and all the tards bought into the story
The grade 12 report
Some Twitter account named citron said it should be $25
Called [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jssu2g/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_12_2020/gc307ae/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) yesterday. Right so far, let‚Äôs see some red!
Yeah I was at $14.62 but I didn‚Äôt want to risk this mooning. Plus this is an IRA so $1 difference in shares isn‚Äôt going to make a difference long term.
First time inversing Wall Street bets by buying puts on NIO yesterday morning. This feels great!
looks like the shorts are done, and contracts are about to expire in 10 minutes. coincidence? i think not
[deleted]
Man
Tempted to go big on VXX calls at this level
When it comes to NIO I'm not fucking selling!!!... my puts.
[deleted]
I had 11/20 $45P, sold for 0.09, now worth $7
I think I‚Äôm just gonna buy stupid far OTM options for spy expiring Wednesday. Like $30 otm ez money
If you don‚Äôt know you should hire a financial advisor man. Jesus...
You can always tell this dude got molested in highschool by the football players.
What are you getting?
40 today?
5 years from now you'll thank yourself (or even by Tuesday with a hopeful runup)
it doesn't matter what Citron said. All the panic selling means none of these people buying were actual investors. There are many firms saying TSLA is worth $100 but you don't see everyone panic selling
[removed]
Good stuff thank you for the reply! 


Edit: 
I also didn‚Äôt think abt the increase in non-lethal training and techniques that would lead to an increase in tasers
Cashed out half at 6:50am -7 am PST highest it went up for me was 11k. Now just bleeding out the other half and waiting till Tuesday
It took me waaaay too long to think of checking the news but I got out ahead and bought a few puts to make myself feel better

Henrik has said he has a major manufacturing announcement the 15th. This event Sunday could have something to do with it as well.
still holding nio. when do i shoot myself
Record cases, emergency summits, leaders awol and golfing or whatever, travel down, closures coming and SPY is pumping. 

I‚Äôll let these 0DTE puts expire worthless apparently. Can‚Äôt make 200% every day.
I thought it was a joke when i opened the report. Giant pictures with maybe 500 words of opinion and no real fundamental reasoning for a $25 price target. Their 17x earnings point is irrelevant when considering the prospects of a growing company in an emerging market.
yea literally its the ugliest car ive ever seen, but not sure thats what determines its stock price lol
[deleted]
I wouldn't be surprise.
Buying options on either side is also fucking retarded after a 30% swing juiced the fuck out of IV lol.

The otm calls for next week are only down like 40%
I believe in EV just not that NIO is worth more than F or GM right now. So glad I got out of my smallstreetbets NIO gamble this morning.
Crbp calls
If NIO dies I‚Äôll buy a Tesla with my put money
Citron boys are giving us tendies!
If I think this is a dump, wait till next week,shorters decided to bring NIO to 25
You retard, this is no TSLA.  Missing the key ingredient to success, Elon.
Thank you. I read this when I woke up and was like fuck it, bear it is, and bought some puts, AND THEY ARE PRINTING.
hahaha, lawd

You'd still make some profit on those calls. Maybe $45C 11/27 if you're not that bullish but $50C has more potential for high returns
I bought at 45 my asshole is red from how hard i got fucked in the ass by NIO today
NIO is going to rocket up next week when people realize they got scammed by Citron.
I shorted both NIO and XPEV last week, yesterday was tough, had to convince myself to keep my diamond hand.
I don't understand how that Citron article dropped NIO so much, specific to NIO have it, and all other China EVs followed the trend. I'm holding 11/20 LI calls, in hopes they trend upward with their earnings next week. Am I an idiot for this?
I was up 75% in the first 15 minutes of market open, haven‚Äôt had time at work to sell. Just got home. Not looking at my calls until 3:55 today. Is NIO at $60 yet?
Only if the notifications were flipped

Biden you mean?
nice flair
nio shills be like "just a pullback for the earnings next week"
If there is a higher power, please allow for us to break out of this hell scape that is the SPY 352-357 range
CRSR chart looks like so good
Hell yeah it‚Äôll be up on Monday
So why tf is ZM going down? Should be fuckin mooning. We're gonna be in lockdown until spring.
corona official only makes stonks go up. 150k new fucking cases, SPY up over 1%. brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
***You're*** right.   
My own feeling would be Docu will go up due to possible lockdowns. 240C 12.18.  
Same feeling with Zm.
Very legal, very cool, very not rigged
[deleted]
its fun to watch nio from the sidelines knowing i sold my calls at $2.50 today morn and theyre now $ .01
I fail sold it to early for 20% profit. Left $10k+ on profit on the table.
i buy them to 0DTE and then when the stock goes down 1% my contract goes down 90%. rinse/repeat

it's actually pretty simple, i'll show you some time!
im getting luckin vibes
Who is this disgusting fat slob Andy Serwer and why is he on yahoo finance?
Depends on age.  

$100k in your 20s

$300k in your 30s

$500k in your 40s.  


You're way above average if you're anywhere close to those numbers. Of course for WSB, below a milly means you're poor.
This NIO drop reminds me of Tesla back in Feb 2020 when the run up was parabolic, dropped, then a slow climb up as people realized the tech and competition. I believe things will work itself out. If fucking NKLA can shoot up on retard strength, so can NIO. If you're holding shares, you're good.
Started green now I‚Äôm in the red this is how it‚Äôs suppose to work right? Fuck you Citron
A win is a win brother! Happy for you. Trade off momentum.
surely you meant pump
feel bad for missing calls on way up and puts on way down...puts can prolly still pay, but idk MM's def got positioned in nio so i dont think its going down harder like that
My BABA calls are green today. üòé
No not all in lol maybe that‚Äôs why I always lose
100 percent
Was there a vaccine news or what? Why the fuck are boomer and travel mooning
NIOs volume at 500 million blows my mind.
hindsight is a whack bitch
In aapl calls
Did you even do your own dd?
Nio shills be like "buy the dip i swear its gonna moon on monday guys"ü§°ü§°ü§°
If only I‚Äôd dumped my entire portfolio into these plays, amiright?
This is the way
Yea that volume is ridiculous...just a meme for now.
[deleted]
Prolly wait for 37 at least if it hits 32 pretty sure it‚Äôll bounce lmao
Lol no,  I'm saying if it's good vacc news,  then why would he (trump) wait till market closes?
NIO doing its best "I can go lower" Dennis Reynolds meme
Sure. Go long. Do do weeklies. I lost 90% in a day, because of PRC policies. And none of that matters if they squish Jack Ma. 

Do some homework and have fun or not. Either way all good.
Then why does literally every other firm have it valued at minimum 80? Citron did this because the dude is a bitter woman, sold his bags at 7 dollars lol
This dip hurts, but I'm still way up on most my calls and I'm gonna keep holding.

Hope no one listened to me at the time of posting that comment though lol.
NIO to the moon! told u cucks! you got to buy puts to sacrifice for ur calls
We at least understand how capitalism works, just not options

I'll take 1 million shorts covering at close for $44 on NIO, Alex...

If you buy nio puts right now over citron writing an article you might be retarded. I don‚Äôt believe in this piece of shit company but to buy puts now instead of calls is just so stupid.
Is this pump because Georgia was called for ü•≠?
You must be the first pilot they are trying that on
FSR $15 12/18
Nio doesn‚Äôt have retard strength anymore
agreed, a little too eccentric for me
> attention biases

Such an educated way of calling you retard.
Saaaame sold for 41 now worth 1.20 a piece
30 seconds in and that ‚ÄúYUGE‚Äù pump has me up 20%
i had multiple spots throughout the day

11/27 48p

11/27 45p

11/13 55p

12/18 33p
Lol I might get 365s just in case also
It doesn‚Äôt take that many contracts unless your buying something that is very small. One amazon contract for December costs 30k+

I bought 400 shares (I know boomer) of JD and immediately sold them after second guessing what I thought they would do for earnings. The thought process is covid isn't affecting them as much so there will be a pullback on ecommerce. So basically the stock is going to go up and I missed out

‚Äú Citron told investors to buy $NIO at $7 - 2 years ago this month.‚Äù The stock wasn‚Äôt even publicly traded 2 years ago and it‚Äôs private price was below $2. People believe this stuff?

WSB starts buying Calls on Bloomberg (the meta call)
Sold at 8% down today, got out with 36% total profit. It's currently down to $41 at 14% down for the day. Might be done with Chinese EV stocks lmao
Imagine not selling NIO after several days of gains. Did you think it was invincible ?
Yep.  They must have forgot how China stocks work.

I fuck and wood but no money. You can replace the ticker with any company with that Citron report.
The absolute lowest NIO will go now is $39. Still a great price for long term
They were cheap AS FUCK when that report came out. 0dte
My cost average is $14.65 and it always pains me to add above my basis. But I might have to buy. Maybe we‚Äôll work our way down to $15

doesn't change anything for the dummies that bought in the high 40's and 50's haha
Happened exactly like that, it was hilarious

its actually way worse. they were up +13% early. now -15% so a 28% swing.

Bought NIO 45p 11/13 yesterday, panicked how much higher it was going AH, and sold this morning at 5% profit... only to realize that I could have made 500% instead if I held.
If we hold down $40 we‚Äôre all good boys
Sold 48c at the peak this morning, feelin good about the day. Monday should take that feeling away tho
Can't wait for the dump into close.
wow thanks retard
Yeah, but only 10% as good as 4000
[removed]
looking for a few behind the scenes plays.  anybody in here heard of nio?  i think they make dump trunks in viet nam or something like that .  not much info out there on them.
What happened in the past month that made it double in price?
Why?

The whole sentiment has shifted in a day, meme stocks always hit a wall at some point. The momentum clearly shifted earlier in the day.

It's now trading at $40. Use your autistic brain
40 was so hard to break for nio let‚Äôs see if it it will be a problem again
Actually they do, that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a bid-ask spread...
I got in an out for a quick scalp this morning in for some shares now
Feel bad for all the nio holders
Everyone blaming Citron....it shows people were ONLY buying NIO cause it kept going up. If one negative opinion tanks the stock it never had any merit
Very insightful
I‚Äôm trying lol really it‚Äôs just so hard
Man right when i bought plug this morning that shit tanked after going up the last month
SQQQ would be good. VXX calls should be good as long as you pick strikes like $20/$25 and choose expiration dates with decent OI.
Haha ironically now I'm scared.  The big question will be earnings report day.  If its positive,  its going through the moon,  but if not,  it'll probably go down to like 25 or some crap
Again, my broker does not offer GME
I promise you Citron did an insider trading. And they profited  bigly after the post

Looks like another vaccine news rotation

40 should hold on NIO. If that doesnt its gg
This company had a great quarter, is aggressively paying off debt, pivoted to specialty alcohols to play the pandemic, and is positioned to make money the next two quarters.  Most of the next two quarters‚Äôs sales are already under contract! 

 My feeling with COVID vaccines is that we are at least 8-10 months out from wide spread availability. That means we‚Äôre basically at half time and this stock is looking like it‚Äôll at least double again, if only for a short amount of time. States in the northeast are starting to lock down again, so I don‚Äôt see this as a risk in the next 6 months. I also don‚Äôt expect this thing to rocket ship, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll keep you up at night.
I bought the dip and 2 hours later I had to deposit money to not get margin calledüôÑ

Still holding üíéüëãüëãüíé
Chinese EV's what a fukin dump
All the next gens are out. GameStop time
This aged well...
Imagine if NIO opened at 60 Monday
Because of one red day? Weak
what a roller coaster that was.
Should have seen what they did to APHA and the entire cannabis market hahaha. 

This is nothing
Too soon!  Fed is covering them until December with option to extend (they did this earlier this year to get to Dec).  This only works if the Fed stops.
Can't even tell if shit on here is a joke or not anymore. On one hand these posts are spot on about the state of this sub. On the other hand this sub is literally 11 year olds.
If you were to point me to two resources on how to learn to DD what would they be.
Cool
Citron
The only thing that would make this day more entertaining is the ‚Äúinfinite short squeeze‚Äù on GME actually happening.
green is green
sooooo he wants to tank the market ah so we cant sell our calls? bet
Citroen article
I'm not that retarded
I made 11$ on NIO yesterday, after paperhanding it within an hour

Best decision of my life, now my portfolio is only 99.8 down

KCAC pumping

Yeah. The actual report they put out didn't seem that convincing. It was just "NIO is overpriced because Tesla 'could potentially' sell it's Model Y at a lower price in China, and because NIO is oversold."

That was literally the only two points. The pictures and the legal jargon at the bottom took up more space than the actual "analysis."
[deleted]
lmaooo prolly so many
Link about the news?
VBIV AXSM breaking out. Charts are absolutely biuriful
I sold my position in NIO yesterday but I was entirely too chickenshit to try catching this dagger. Ah well, still made a bit on the way up.
 numba 1 rule, always take profits :(
I kept waiting and eventually pulled the trigger at 15.4
400 is 10x better than 40.
I didn‚Äôt listen to myself and I now have NIO put tendies, gotta inverse yourself to make certain tendies
BA is free money hold till 240
35k to 22
Nio investors jumping back into TSLA!! Get in now boys!!
If you have balls buy into NIO now
No you didn‚Äôt
lol
How do you guys go broke on calls? Are you buying 1000 contacts or something?
My broker does not allow me to trade GME unfortunately. Otherwise I would have definitley played it to get some tendies
I‚Äôm talking about you, being wrong about what you just wrote. I‚Äôm guessing reading comprehension isn‚Äôt your strong suit? Stock picks being a close second.
IV is through the roooof
Damn that hurts.
11/27 340 spy puts. Here we gooooo.
what's a good sized portfolio in yallz opinion, in general
1st time since covid, all indexes are up and i m down for the day
this game so fun even tho im a loser
we showed resistance earlier this week around 39 dollars, I am going to see what happens there and look for buying back in.
It‚Äôs more like sand, which is course and irritating and gets everywhere
That‚Äôs fuckin rough
bouncing
üòÇüòÇ he‚Äôll no, I think if anything Monday and Tuesday it makes a run to 45, but I think it will be flattish maybe hit 43 on Tuesday and then dip to 35
Rotation from Nio to BABA.
They got lucky on roulette hit red.
Fellow bears if you want to short another one jump in on PDD and thank me later
Buy the NIO dip retards.
Man, should have held on a little bit longer today to my NIO puts.

This is an absolute bloodbath.
I almost did. Me and Citron would have a fight if that happened.
Who would be selling now. Either come up on Monday by about 3 pm (or sometime after Tuesday when post-earnings cash grab is done) or at the very least wait to re-gain some losses.

If he thinks it's going down it would be stupid to buy shares. Credit call spreads would be the move.

Spy you mother fucker if you don‚Äôt dump today I swear to god
Whoms'tn't _haven't_ they shorted, amirite?
I would IF I HAD MONEY SMH
Yes, mods. This man right here
Wtf is going in with NIO? It‚Äôs down another percent every time I check. That‚Äôs a huge drop for zero news. Anything happen?
Buy GAC Group at a buck 20.They're the ones that invested 100 million into Nip to keep them afloat.
I did before when it was at 295 before the big drop. Now I want to sell 255p 30dte. Might open 2 contracts.
factual, very big facts, buy calls ahead of time
Just cleaned my ears for the first time in a month. I think I came a little bit
there it is :) see the v-shape has begun! you're welcome bulls
[deleted]
Iirc didn‚Äôt Nio hit 12 then drill hardcore cuz of Goldman downgrading it‚Äôs target to 7 rofl which they ofc bought up
oof pton just touched below 100
holy crap the loss on here is going to be insane. I feel bad. It was funny when nio was down 5% but now its just heartbreaking.
Idk üò¢üò≠
Just some Friday profit taking. Nbd.
[deleted]
no way.
could it finally be time for BABA to start reeecovering.
How wild that the opinion of one company about the future of another company can alter its share price by 15% in a day.
People comparing NIO to Luckin lol are delusional. Coffee shops are low barrier to entry and can be duplicated easily by anybody in this sub with $50k. 

Manufacturing EVs have high barrier to entry and no random idiot has the resources or knowledge to do it. Also the push for clean energy is a worldwide push. 

Thank you for listening to my ted talk. üí∞üëç
No holding anymore. Looks risky. It could absolutely rocket back up with the volume it has, but also looks like people are taking those profits. The valuation doesn't make sense anymore haha not that it ever really did.
You retards have such pussies hands, everybody selling Nio.
NIO dump so fucking satisfying.
[lyft layoffs news coming soon. buy calls](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Another-set-of-Layoff-and-Hiring-Freeze-SAJC8WU6)
are we friends with elon chan again?
Man I was jealous of you NIO autists this morning, now I just feel bad
xpev, li and nio pumping and dumping in unison, very systematic.
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[deleted]
Don't short NIO. Short the other EVs dumbass. Atleast NIO has street rep. WTF is a LI?
So frustrating. I just want a lil dip to add some shares
Take profit triggered at 53üòé
I‚Äôm gonna do 15k of 11/27 340
dude market will pump after the close, not now.
tech isnt dead, but its life has been taken out...used to only go up...but now with so many vaccine announcements coming up, the trade has shifted to value and reopening stocks...I like sabr as a value airline stock play, do u guys have any other good ones? i know yall nut over ba lol, might get a spread for next week
This doesn‚Äôt feel like podracing
up 3% nothing significant
Wtf NIO I am in shambles
Wish I was a respected analyst, I would be manipulating the market like a mf.
Don't worry guys, NIO is still up 2,389% in the last 52 weeks.
Almost a 30% swing today for NIO. That‚Äôs cray cray
Hold my LI 45 calls?
Wow rip to my gains today lol.
Just got some MS puts
vol on sq is too low, holding my 185c till next week
What made you think they didn‚Äôt?
I have found my new trading strategy
Any BA bulls? breaking 200 anytime soon?
ugly car agreed, it is like a tricycle
Apparently, this is what caused NIO to drop in case anyone is interested:

Dude on here thought he bought NIO bottom at $44 üòÇ Poor guy said he would check k tomorrow.
I bought several Jan calls today and not worried at all.  Thanks.
[deleted]
Sold my short at 51 was like ‚Äùfuuuck this bitch aint going down‚Äù changed to long 30sec after. Exactly 4minutes before everthing turned to shit.  Very very small positions (like 1k in loss so far). Feels fucking good!
Sadly I‚Äôm not lol
üôè
Forsooth, niüÖ±üÖ±a
bro what the fuck are you talking about
i worked for Chase like over ten years ago...accumulated about 37 shares. i feel that way every quarter when i get my $33 check haha. the good news is that even if the stock went to zero tomorrow i made wayyyy more than it ever cost me
I did. I lost 15 dollars. But okay
Take my money
Citron probably would price Tesla at $90.
Holy shit NIO
Well done to NIO put holders. You have bigger cajones than me
This hurts me, but its funny so I'll accept it
Certainly hope so but as of right now I‚Äôm feeling too confident!
Doesn't it first have to go up?
Sometimes I feel bad about missing out on millionaire plays in my options account, but then I realize that for one, I probably wouldn‚Äôt hold something like NIO long enough to get there and two, if I did decide to hold something that long, a day like today could wipe me out.
Why do u hate money
[deleted]
just did the math...baba closing green and spy going red would net me 2.7 hookers this weekend
Hahaha
6.8k to 3.1k today. Up 1.7k to that 6.8 over the last 2 weeks so not terribly worried üòÇ
[deleted]
I thought I was having a bad trading day until I looked at NIO
Short attacks everywhere üò§
i hope to see some gay bear gains off nio on the wsb front page.

i know someone had to had bought a shit ton of 0.10 puts on here and hit the lotto today
Where my nio gang at lmao
They didn‚Äôt sell their calls
dude market isn't logical. it will pump if they want to and they want it.
no

Rh bad
where will the NIO massacre stop?!
I guess SPY just going to keep melting up....nobody taking profits huh?
I sold to early for 20 % profit instead of 300+%
The only house i'm buying with NIO is one made of gingerbread.
No fuck that. SOLO IS THE MOVE! Follow HAN SOLO
Seriously. This fucking idiot acts like these companies don‚Äôt have corporate espionage / spy‚Äôs since the early 70s. 

‚ÄúHey we‚Äôve announced a new vaccine. The guys across the hall haven‚Äôt figured out what we‚Äôve done yet but... maybe‚Äù

Polio was only eradicated because there was money to be made.
Guys. I think NIO is in trouble
[deleted]
A quick Ctrl-F reveals 175 mentions of 'NIO' on the first page of comments. Can we just rename this the 'Daily NIO Thread' and have a safe space somewhere else?
I dunno bout you retards but I rode this thing up and down faster then a stripper with a crack addiction
OUCH
[deleted]
It‚Äôs ok to admit you scared üçº
Is that a question or a statement?
This shit is delicious.
I love this
NIO call holders, you're saved. I got puts at the bottom. Gold me EOD plz
WSBs are about FDs. So it's natural that they would harass you on a Friday.

But sure tell us more about your long term investment strategies.
It‚Äôs consolidating for take off
Regretting selling my $15C leap and buying UVXY calls today lol
Do it vagina.. you‚Äôre gonna look back and regret not pulling the trigger
Whoms't
so its not space x?
Aged like fucking rotten milk.
NIO was at $3 at the beginning of the year ü§£ü§£ü§£ why didn‚Äôt you bulls buy then? RIP
No you didn‚Äôt
I want to know what happens here. I also want to yolo 50k worth of 0dte SPY puts....
holy shit PTON
NIO 10/20 31P up 300%
Sell those puts before earnings or you‚Äôll be fucked
Someone buy my puts
All the noobs here about to find out that Asia has no qualms stealing westerner's cash
Oh... imagine üòçüòç time to retire üòÇ
It‚Äôs okay ‚Äî just take a breath and walk away for a bit. You can make it back.
Exaaaaaaactly. Zero perspective here, you will find. Not saying NIO to 100 but me thinks it‚Äôs a good day to buy.
Final hour rug pull
Are you up 300% now?
You‚Äôre selling 275 puts?
You definitely are a retart
My NIO alert just snapped me out of my work trance.  I'm still not buying in until Monday.  Cash gang through the weekend is much less stressful these days.
The NIO 11/13 $45P's were .01 this morning. It's sitting at $4.20 now.....

If Citron did insider trading, they could have turned 50k into 21 million.......
[deleted]
Yesterday:  Man, I should have put my life savings in NIO calls.

Today: Man, I should have put my life savings in NIO puts.
Girls who wear hijabs are cute
This is hilarious. Burn NIO.
NIO back to lows we haven‚Äôt seen since Tuesday
Lol
Hahaha üòÇ
Who wants to brigade citron Twitter
remindME! 1 year check this comment lmao
This has been the best week ever for me trading, holy shit this last hour is gonna be nuts
Lol
So fucking illegal
AMC puts free money
:( sadly we're all retail cucks
Thanks for the information, I appreciate it! I‚Äôll just keep holding then and see what happens.
Yeah I‚Äôm chyna kill my self
[deleted]
I bought a few puts there but took profits way, way too soon
Who bought nio calls and that monsterous peak?
I have puts. F
Scooped up nio shares at 40.97. Not feeling great haha
China is a big market and they are at 5% Tesla's production with a cheaper product + the government wants to see it succeed - you don't throw 1 billion at a company to simply let it crash.  I see no reason for this NIO negative overeaction for more. Citron is doing his hustle, and good for him it worked.
PLTR last 45 minutes is the flattest chart i've ever seen.
I need Donny to make a complete ass out of himself. Crazier the better. Like completely ignore the COVID shit and go right into how he won the election.
BABA üöÄplease?
bags getting heavier...
What? Turned 70 into 270 no?
Somebody poke ZM
If a stock is $100 and it rises 20% you now have $120. If you sold you've made $20. If you didn't and the $120 stock drops 20% you didn't lose $20 you've lost $24.
Bottom me out like Barry Seagle aka spread eagle
bought nio calls at 47 cause i read here it was going to moon

can someone direct me to correct department to process my refund kthnxbai
China congratulated Biden so mango told them to dump it
haha nio stahp its not funny anymore
if you bought Nov 18/27 calls, don't sell it you'll would certainly break even on earning worst case scenario, if your lost is less than 1k you can make it back and still have change in your pocket.
i posted it before market open.
I have never wanted to FOMO harder into anything more than BABA. It‚Äôs just too big to be kept down like this. I might sell another put.  Currently have 275p 12/11 open
Buyers at the top

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhSYEMEEG5c
respect, diamond hands
Yes
It will in due time. 2021 or 2022 probably since were a bit out from production. Big news this Sunday about manufacturing could send it into 20‚Äôs. First analyst PT was $22 with more to come.
FSR is the next move
Stop telling them, let them be retarded lol
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
When you realize Citron is the true enemy here...
I bought baba and it tanks. Then switch to aapl calls and it also dips. Finally switch to qqq puts and it goes up. Can't win in anything.
NIO crash confirmed
Good chance to go into the weekend with some lotto tickets
Baba getting hit with anti-monopoly laws in China. Be careful. Chinese government mad at Jack Ma. They posted $110B sales on Singles Day(their version of Black Friday), and the stock is tanking.

Be wary.
Oh smart let‚Äôs try
NIO for 5 weeks straight:üìàüìàüìà

*I buy calls*

*The next day...*

# Citron: WELL AKTUALLLYü§ì
I‚Äôd be thrilled with $100
I dont enjoy it. I just grimly embrace the suck.
BA puts to be exact
[deleted]
 I see
Fuck it I‚Äôm buying spy puts.
Me and Peloton are back together again <3
This sorta looks like my Li Auto play LOL
Your DNA should be investigated for an extra chromosome.
He‚Äôs out again. NIO down 15%
If they've held for this long, they'll really be in for a treat on 11/18
[removed]
It was due for a bounce. That thing was bleeding so bad. I should‚Äôve pulled the trigger at 11 idk what I was thinking
Msft
Raise your hand if you going full retart next week with the weekly NAIL calls for MAXIMUM leverage for HD and LOW earnings?
Anyone like SQ calls as much as I do?

Aw yes, my NIO puts I panic sold for $90 at open are now worth $7,100... off to buy some $ROPE
just asked around on a different sub and you have to be prompted to activate it you cant choose to do it yourself. For your reference: I was prompted in the middle of a buy order, I have a margin account, I don't have margin activated though, I was on a desktop, and it wasn't on the day of an expiration day. Not sure if that stuff affects your ability to get prompted/invited to use the feature, but those were the conditions I was under.
This huge daily swing on NIO makes me sad, but understanding it went down 20% from a grade 12 report that looks like it was done at 11:59pm, I can‚Äôt wait for the daily swing the other way after their ER.
It just keeps dipping, when do the people start buying?
You think?
Average up, average down, average sideways idgaf. Just buy more NIO for free tenders
Because you bought after a 25% weekly run up bro haha. Look to enter when there‚Äôs a dip. If you‚Äôre buying at an ATH you better love the asset long term
Shoulda cashed out
"Intense buying leads to negative returns" So you mean to tell me it took a fucking bloomberg journalist to figure out a shit ton of people buying into something means it's going to correct shortly after? One of you guys land a job there you haven't mentioned or something?
15% is 15%
Great. NIO is up to 55 now.
Good job!
Just die already NIO go back to $30 where you belong
If your talking about more puts yes
That's what I did, up loads!
welcome to the hydraulic press channel
thank you for your input, DeerCum
someone told me once that it doesn't happen if you have a pending order to sell. Put something in that's ridiculously high and then you can replace it later if you want to sell.

edit: if this fucks you hardcore keep in mind that I'm an idiot and am probably wrong
I bough back in October
Means buy puts.
Always catch that penny stock rocket after its already started climbing.
Still holding. My puts will go ITM

0.65 to 2.64
I'm magic, probably Bigly vaccine news Monday
NIO go up!!!!!!!!!!
Ehhhhhhhhh
What do you think of SQQQ call/VXX call?
a singular person gets salty that he sold NIO at $7 so he writes a hit piece that NIO should be $25 and tanks the entire Chinese EV market.  only 2020.
Yeah they set the target to 25$ or some shit lol
I was wondering the same thing lol or will it go down like Li and NIO
I've traded on shrooms and DMT (separately, multiple occasions). Yeah, the wiggling numbers do make it hard to focus.
Rip to all the clowns who bought nio calls today. I do have to say though; you absolutely deserve it
Riding it hard
Won't go below $39. If so, NIO $50C 11/27 üëÄ
Sold my NIO shares this morning. Bought puts. Made 75% both ways
zm being pinned at 400 today to fuck 0DTE option holders
What did they expose? Literally nothing. They just took advantage of ours and then re entering at a lower price
[removed]
I read the report and it isnt devastating for NIO like a lot of Citron reports are, but I knew I had the tiger by the tail and the run was going to end soon. I built my position back when it was like $7.5. 200% on shares and who knows how much on calls since April.  I might be back in NIO but it's been overbought. I mean it spent like 10 minutes in the $30-$40 range. LMAO

Cause I‚Äôm freeeeeeee free faaaaallin
All that NIO money gonna go back into BABA
I‚Äôm a bear but goddamn the breadth in this market is unreal
üòé
I had  5 42p as a fucking straddle and sold at 10am. Almost 100%gain but still... they would have been in the money now
STOR looking good
Fucking fuck I had calls a week ago fuck
Spy calls at 10:05 üëç
Hey big brain, people will start posting loses at eod, just expect more over the weekend when they free to do so
Who the fuck is William Li
I very much do. This isn‚Äôt even a low point this week, just the first firm to set a low price target on NIO, almost certainly just because they are shorting it. +8-10% on Monday, and then who knows what the fuck will happen after earnings
Nah, you‚Äôre just late to the party
NIO sub 40 EOD
A ‚Äú$54‚Äù stock just dropped $13 in one day what does that mean üßê
It literally broke through the VWAP, contested it after, then a hard fat fucking candle right after...clear indication to go short
Im pretty sure that news is priced in considering the PFE news earlier this week. Don't think market will react to this honestly unless it comes out that the results aren't good
Phone trading has compressed the pump to dump cycle to a single session now LOL
Just buy shares now and sell those calls and collect the high premiums
Did anyone else buy at the literal 54 top
Plz daddy
Recommend buy more? Surely it will moon next week
Lol

‚ÄúI may be EARLY but I‚Äôm not WRONG.‚Äù 


You for the next 6 weeks.
Then why wait till market close?
I sold my tsla shares at 402.69, just to buy them back at....402.69.
Lol

Mango set to talk about covid and vaccine in 1 hour and 15 minutes
Sold mid first drop
Guys don‚Äôt sell NIO it will bounce back in a few years ü§°ü§°ü§°
Lol so you waited till today to respond because it might have kept going up.

Nostradamus over here
absolutely amen. after having fomo i yolo'd some puts and took a humble profit for a new guy. its not about winning big, now, or always. its about winning once and being happy about it
Citron was short selling Tesla in February. Why anyone listens to those assholes is beyond me.

what finding shit companies and exposing them ü§°
scale into more baba?
fuck it puts at the bottom of nio!
god forbid i can feel good on a friday afternoon
Stocks only grow up my dude.
NIO is backed by ccp tho.. I think they should be good until the China government decides otherwise...
This looks like  a safe space to me.
No fucking shit.

Look at travel stocks and COVID stocks
Man it‚Äôs such a shame that my broker doesn‚Äôt offer shorts for Nio

Easiest money made this year was buying calls on Friday right before close and offloading on Monday at open since Mondays are almost always blood green.
Straight up manipulation
Hahahaha
bought 2k at 52 this morning. It hurts, but I had bought about 3k when it was around 32, so I'm still technically green. yeesh.

Somethings up though, TSLA, LI, NIO, and XPEV all look the same today. It's bizarre.
ouch
no one here riding FSR?
buy low sell high?
Yeah I‚Äôm actually down now. I sure do hate myself apparently.

Also holding till 2030 if it‚Äôs still even existsü§ûü§û
I just got $1009 in ivr calls and 500 shares I believe
25% intraday swing for NIO haha
This aged poorly. Like this post will.
of course it was. It is glaringly obvious
It true i bought meme, very safe very easy good meme. Buy meme, recommended.
Ding it!
Yes
I'd be pissed if I'm William Li. The Citron report just said that it is TOO expensive for Citron, not for us with our deep pockets.
bought @ $15 b4 close yesterday, sold @ 15.36 this morning, don't plan on holding it, good luck to you, just wanted to see how the stock turns out today after a flat earning.
With something as volatile as this, if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna be up/active then set limit sells/stop losses with prices your comfortable with
BABA and JD are the only ones I feel kinda comfortable with even with all the current shit. It‚Äôll pass sooner than later
Hey guys! Just woke up after a long nap, how‚Äôre my NIO 11/13 calls doing? Premarket looked dank!
Buy high sell low
The fuck is wrong with r/technology? Are they an anti-big-tech subreddit? Every time I click some interesting sounding shit like ‚ÄúFB working on AR-assisted surgery tech‚Äù it‚Äôs a bunch of r/politics people saying that Zuck is the devil and we should rely on bartering and witchcraft instead of computers or some shit.

This is the most autistic but easily most sane fucking part of Reddit.
Time to switch to calls on NIO
The micro futures are a godsend when it comes to collateral. It takes a while but a good goal to set out is to turn the margin required for a microfuture into the full contract.
US Govt back to ByteDance divesting US operation of Tik Tok.

Puts on FSLY
I'd hold on recovery stocks there might be more vaccine news from moderna over the weekend
Yeah I did, because I update my stop losses lol. Check my post history
ü§£
Triggered a NIO sell-off
Puts on HYG.. market crash is coming.. gay bear will win!
Dude NIO 45p today's expiration opened at 0.01 and the high was 1.79 lol that's a 179 bagger LOL

Learning from this
Let nio hit 7. Why the fuck not. Seems like a cool number.
It‚Äôs a shitpost man. Already locked in

Can‚Äôt wait for RH to sell my calls before power hour
Fair enough

Just remember to buy the dip
What the fuck is this guy smoking, and where can I get some?
Idfk man. Bought baba calls for the fuck of it.
DiamondHands man. The Citron report has no substance. We'll be alright.
So can we all agree to keep NIO above 40 today?

Hey
Buy the dip.
You can‚Äôt say this shit is no manipulated, fuck citron

Palantir upgraded from 13 to 15 by Morgan Stanley 20 is next by the new year remember this post
Lol yes because buyers and sellers take that into account.
Pattern Day Trading restrictions are fucking stupid.
I‚Äôm stupid as hell and even more of a pussy, you really think this will look better next week? I‚Äôm shitting myself for no reason it seems.
Bought nio call yesterday, sold this morning for 200% gain, bought put, sold for 80% gain
I dont know what this means, but it pleases my confirmation bias.
That's just where we go out for a smoke break by Club 15.51. brb
Good. I can provide meme of u give ctedit detail. Safe transaction. But be quick I'm tunning out of stock

Is anyone still bagholding NIO? Still holding my 11/20s, but fuck man, I'm not too confident about Monday anymore.

I've only ever read about this formation in textbooks
I believe it will be worth a lot more than $40 long term and I'm still up 100% for the month but I could have been close to 300% if I hadn't gotten greedy lol.
Sold my bio calls when before it tanked
Ha
$30
Not NIO. SPY puts :(
Ban
Right... if only retail investors could band together and fuck those corporate investors when they try to make moves like this. Their algorithms have exacted our emotional reactions
I bought in at $29, tf you talking about.
maybe but your max pain theory just fell through partner.
50$ easy
just ding the fucking bell
No pumping overnight... says the caboose of the Li auto/Nio train.

PDD
This aged well.
Why are you crying. Just lock your positions in and shut up.
So NIO is selling itself?
Is buying NIO puts right now as retarded as buying the top this morning...
I just grabbed $55c 11/27 exp I hope I didn't jump in too early
oddly nice feeling watching the price of my NIO shares go down as my puts go up
damn nio not done dumping
Paper hands üôå why did I sell my PDD this morning
False nagatives a way more common.. so he has the virus
Done
Im gambling not investing. The top of the day is the only top I care about.

not taking sides here, but comparing nio to nkla is kinda absurd
my neighbor told me to buy like 2 months ago and i didnt listen
did anyone make any good plays today? if so can you rub it in my face real quick i need the motivation
üôã
Volume on spy is so low, do you guys expect a rug pull
Prob not
Citron should be investigated for market manipulation. Doing shit like that should literally not be legal.
i have 350c and 400c for 6/18/21.
IPOB 11/20 20c
At 29 buy calls
Yea. @25$
My stop loss saved my ass tbh. It's a saving grace for someone who cant sit at the computer all day
Either we dump hard from here or we moon; my bet is on mooning so obviously I'm gonna be wrong :(
3:59 yes

-1% for the week, bro
Sold my Nio puts at open for $2.3k loss
When will this market hurry the fuck up and drop so I can go in on spy calls. I‚Äôm not trusting past 360 until next year.
You guys up? I‚Äôm down12%
It‚Äôs printing so move on to puts!
Most of us are very bad at this bud, keep your chin up it's Friday

Which of you bastards broke NIO! (Posted 2:42)
went deeeeeeep in tdoc
If I have learned from lurking in this subreddit is to do the exact opposite of what people call.
What's NIO price after earning?
This is such a massive overreaction. We‚Äôre just back to where we were quite literally a day ago.
I sold at the top and tried to catch a falling knife with a conservative limit price thinking there‚Äôs no way we go that low. Lo and behold we went that low and behold we went way lower. I don‚Äôt know where bottom is
That citron article?
Fake and gay market
FML for selling those NIO 44P‚Äôs too early. Easy 7 bagger ü§°
Who in their right mind would want to hold calls on anything over the weekend

Edit* so this means buy as many calls as you can. Inverse logic and reap profit
Zoom is manipulated as fuck  lmao wow
I mean... it‚Äôs stupid but it honestly works pretty well. It‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs a breakeven point for every stock where the memes start to just annoy people. When we hit that point, the selloff begins. I wonder if you could actually model it
Soooo is it time for NIO calls again yet?
[deleted]
Well, probably I should go with data and calculated a correlation (perhaps wavelet correlation) between the two stock time series.
0dte puts at open were not the move
I think those will print on Monday
How can i apply for a job @ Citron. Will work for free for these guys.
Exactly, the Andy Left report has no substance. It'll lose steam soon

Made profit swing trading the 1DTE ADBE call. Green day for the rest of my positions.
I approve of this message.
The stage is being set for an unknown unknown to fuck shit up. VIX longs look attractive here
Mine says 15.48 I think it's broken.
Nio doesn‚Äôt always go up
This didn‚Äôt age well
If it reacts like LI, everything will be fine next week. Just looks like a huge AH selloff. Could take profit, and re-buy monday to be safe, but premiums will jump.
41 now.
Same. We were on it and should have let it run
Is volume kill while we wait for mango to talk or what?
Bro $6?!!
Bunch of suckers and losers
order at 39 ready!
Robinhood was telling me I can't buy 0dte options when I had some that were expiring today, and that I could only sell them. Can you buy 0dte options on RH?
GTFO zm. Vaccine news gonna kill it for good on Monday
Sold at top. Leaps on sale üî•üî•
Yea as soon as that report for 25$ a share came out i loaded the put up
Oopsies seems bynd is not done dipping
Got that sweet $1.82 dividend from Apple. I made it boys.
35p for next week?
Bruh I need spy to fucking die Monday
DIAMOND HANDS
dont need it bro.  the call is ur collateral
Lol. You could make the same amount of money that NIO gang made riding this up by shorting it back to $2. Brb. Asking wife‚Äôs bf for an advance on my allowance!
Lmfao just woke up. Nio is uh
I have also NIO calls guys wtf do we close ? Is this going to hell ?? My margin is killing me
I‚Äôll hold, I got them at 10. I wanna see if they get stimulus
Fucking nice tho! I never get even 100% on my shit
But NIO calls now. $50 by Tuesday or ban me
Bruh you got any DD
Damn, I am sorry about the timing of the above post.
Who did citron report on? NIO?
tf happened? whats the news
The company is fine. You should look at their products first.

The valuation is the problem. It‚Äôs all hype.
yea so no one really. Obscure and insignificant amount for their share price. Hence the fact that it's shitting all the way back to 20$
That would cut down on thread volume by about 90%
Imagine getting downvoted for both of these plays two hours ago,

&#x200B;

Green baby
I also bought nio calls right after i sold and stock on margin üòé
NIO going full jihad holy war on itself rn
I went from -150$ on XPEV to +700$ and back to +37$. Wow
Not for NIO tho
So do you think that Citron downgrade NIO was on purpose to burn some of the call volume off?
get AYRO calls fam
Nio is the back half of a DJ khaled song today.


*And we go down and we go down and stay there*
SPY under 2% from ATH. Seems legit with everything else going on. Lol
xpev down to 30?
Whats the usual reaction to layoffs and hiring freezes? Stock goes up?
I made a post shorting it and a bunch of autists here did too, bulls are dumb
This man is consistent.

Who did they short now?

That's why you sell small amounts each time. Lock in some profits but let some ride
A share of SPY is 8 times as big as a share of NIO.
I sold my fisker 15c 11/20 for a small loss yday since the price was stagnating for the last couple of days.  This morning it went up by 360%.
So is NKLA. Seems like a great company. Both have no product out, no tech themselves (they use another OEM's EV tech), no production capability, and founder's previous companies went under. But hey, maybe this time is different.

Will NIO have a comeback? Will Bulls or Bears be able to pull a ten bagger? Or will Theta Gang rule? Find out next week!
Brooo
# rip nio
so happy for Tony. He came from humble beginnings. I do DD on the side but damn that shit is straight up ridiculous. Youll get offers to drive 7 miles for like 6 dollars. I only do that shit if im going to get lunch or something and turn on the app. Sometimes ill get an offer at the same food joint where Im at and the drop off is a few blocks from where i live. Other than that its pretty garbage
I feel fine with my position, but damn call holders had the rug pulled out...
Let us break 41 first. Looking a bit strong.
Sold my NIO 2023 leaps and bought BABA 2022 leaps. +125% is enough for me. No need to watch it try to make that back for the next 2 years.
All this shits going on and vxx is down 2 dollars from yesterday. Fuck the vxx

Stock goes up 120% in two weeks. ‚ÄúSo unpredictable‚Äù lmao

pretty much everyone in my office voted for Trump because they like his antics. and the democrats are going to take away their 401k's apparently.
I‚Äôm surprised that Mods didn‚Äôt make a separate thread for NIO like they did back in the TSLA to the moon days.
Look at xpeng too, I think it‚Äôs whales taking some of their 6000000% profits
Time to crank it up, JD
Thank fuck I‚Äôm not the only one. Sold and went YOLO into baba.
Nah don't short NKLA so many already shorting it imagine the squeeze lol
Mee
I was happy that I broke even my NIO 45p 11/13 that I bought yesterday. Sold at 5% profit... I check now and I could have made 7 times more than that. lol
Someone's mad they didn't hop on that NIO train earlier.
Closed at top & going to open some leaps with the gains. I ain't no sucker
I was doing that all last week and just said fuck it yesterday and went in on JD so I def feel you about that.
West coast sucks and I feel the pain some days
U good?
It has no reason to. For all we know, China is pumping this. ALSO, im just buying back into 40c may2021 for much cheaper
Webull keeps freezing when I look at nio.

Fuck citron
Sold 44P for NIO this morning at .06... Bout to long $ROPE

Same lmao, sold at a markup, buying at a discount üòé
Dkng $$$
Salute to all you NIO soldiers
I‚Äôll see ya on this thread in a year. No hard feelings I just disagree
Cover your eyes!
Kinda bummed I dumped my puts when it broke 45. No use crying over spilled milk tho
Tried this did not respawn.. help?
So am I shorting or longing?
Bears gotta eat sometime
I sold my 41p and 45p nio puts for 100% profit at the first dip. I wish I held out.
I bought nio puts today that expired today at a 49 strike when they were up and sold for only a 300% gain if i held 4 hours it woulda been 1200% üò≠
Who bought 0DTE NIO puts at the top? I need to see some gain porn, PLTR has me edging all day
SPY 4h MACD looking like a bearish crossover is coming
Dead üêª walkin

SPY is about to complete the mythical ‚Äúfourth nipple‚Äù formation. Milk will rain down from the heavens. Prepare yourselves my bovine brothers
I went all in on NIO call options expiring next week... bought in at the steal entry price or 53.96. Now I am diamond handing until we hit $420 next week. üëç
I think most of us are holding. We can long it cause we don't have a dte. I don't plan to sell for a few years at least, but we got er and nio day coming up in the short term to show us we made the right decision
I believed in the graph
Right? These people man. Many don‚Äôt realize that theyre competing with Tesla which has a massive competitive advantage and can take NIOs profits into the ground. Simple economies of scale example.
Yes in asia they are sleeping and when the market open they will realize holywhit it's so like buy buy buy on Monday and it will moon x3. I hate to admit it but it's a quite clever scheme. Get you and a bunch of people to inverse pump and dump so deinflate and buy? Right before earnings, right before weekend....my guess is the guys doing this are gonna keep dumping untill 2 mins before close and then buy and hold and make a fortune.
I have weeklies expiring worthless today, Jan calls down 30% (was 40% this morning) ü§ô
Freefalling :(
[deleted]
I made some very bad decisions in the past 30 minutes
BABA should go up if JD results are good, most important thing atm is health of Chinese consumer economy.

If things look back to normal it should be good for BABA, JD, TCEHY, PDD, etc.
65 cents each way
Nio 35p for next week
Is there a news/rumor?
Yes, but my point was everyone was acting like they were in the red after this insane couple of days ü§£
[removed]
Please send so I can inverse them all, thanks.
Glad I got in at $14 :) Unless it drops below 14, then I am not glad.
Been saying this since yesterday. So you know its rigged 

NIO MAX PAIN for 11/13/2020 is drumroll

39
When China sends its electric vehicles, they're not sending their best. They‚Äôre sending cars that have lots of problems, and they‚Äôre bringing those problems with us. They‚Äôre bringing NIO. They‚Äôre bringing XPEV. They‚Äôre bringing LI.
We don‚Äôt have loss porn because we‚Äôre not selling. See you Monday.
You can tell he's a boomer based on his grammar
NIO stop!! They have a family!!!
Dam guys I told yall to look at IPOB this morning and look at it now just keeps climbing
‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Nio gonna moon early next week on earnings, just wait
Imagine being that big brain
Rookie mistake
People who bought NIO:
Do you believe in the company? Or were you in for memes?
yeah im being touched by it
So... who's gonna try to buy this NIO "dip"?
Just a reminder the 50 day sma on nio is around $30
Yeah, I mean the volume of calls expiring today in the 50's was insane so not a big surprise its a red day but I was not expecting a negative 14 percent day.
Wow great insight
LMAO exactly my thought
SPY 353p 11/16 lets go bitch
Hopefully NIO is blind to the bullshit going on come ER
NIO calls duh
Steel Stocks on an afternoon moon mission. I wonder if this is a sign of something to come.
Opportunity to double down on NIO is here
[deleted]
I'm holding. Earnings should provide some reassurance for shareholders.
I wouldn't buy it here.
Can memes be dreams? 
NIO boys it‚Äôs time to buy
not gonna lie, i‚Äôm kind of retarded
YOLO
500M volume on NIO. Most I‚Äôve seen
All I have to say is thank fuck I did not buy calls for NIO earnings at that dip earlier today
[deleted]
LMAO! No. Peloton is completely unpredictable. Strange thing is it usually holds up even when everything else is tanking.
Tell me why it‚Äôs over valued?
[removed]
Even that report was so hastily written like he made it in 10 minutes just before the market open?
Okay. Yea I mean obviously I disagree. I‚Äôm disagreeing to the tone of $25,000
You mentioned your interest in AI earlier. Have you thought about setting up your own software?
Id just use a free one like robinhood or webull.
If you played it right, you cashed in both ways on NIO
ohhh. a bit of an early pump? i wasn't expecting shorts to cover for another 25 minutes or so.
I wouldn‚Äôt give that guy a penny with his track record
Imagine the dump after earnings

Shot my 300 win mag 4 times and my shoulder feels like I got hit by a mule

always hold until profit retard.

stonks only go up over time
yo i deadass would go to jail if i was in a room with citron staff
Better get NIO puts before earnings. Absolutely zero chance the numbers match up with the hype.. 50/50 chance it goes up or down.
DONNNIEEEEEEE GET TF OUT THANK YOU calls printing
Ya hate to see it.....


Hahahaha jk you NIO fgts are the worst
I may have Fomo'd into NIO today but atleast it wasn't at $54 and a weekly at that.
IWM going vertical.

I had calls on that bump, but that was part of the corona rotation into tech, yes they had good earnings, but if u look at any tech stock in that period you see the same increase
PLUG GUHHH

Send them to me and I‚Äôll provide some ass
NIO to 100 huh....guess nobody paid attention to what happened to HYLN
Good job!
[removed]
last pump it touched 23 briefly and settled around 20.5. It's at about 20 now... so I think longer dated puts are a smarter play -- cheaper and the lockdowns / rona cases are going to create a lot of downward pressure on the stock. 

Buy some puts for 2 weeks out. Maybe some FD calls if you want to vaccine yolo. If/when it pumps, then go up to the tits in puts.

America are at war vs China
NIO(chinese)shares sold to US fcking retard investors who are fcking idiots.

aaand jinxed it.
...after earnings.
You fucked up big time man
Butt plug üçë
The only support was at 41, idk what "supports" it was braking through in your eyes. Clearly shit at technicals
Well, it‚Äôs not so much kissing 44 as it deepthroating it. But don‚Äôt worry buddy, it can‚Äôt go any lower. Definitely not. Gonna be back over 50 by Monday open.
[deleted]

Not happening kiddo üë∂
spy up, everything else red. makes sense
Let's see what you're at now!

My puts +55%, not complaining
Smh
What matters is there are some angry whales who wanted an in that‚Äôs all. Real talk tho, NIO doubled sales in their last report and just like tesla the sales won‚Äôt justify the price
TSLA
[deleted]
I pray to god you are right
Calls that expire today. Most people know the stock will recover some Monday before earnings. It is a massive sell off today.
r/cautiousinvesting?
I'm tempted to at least grab one cheap call before close
Does NIO rise again after earnings? Hmm.
[deleted]
You doing 11/18s? I wanna throw a little at a single spy FD
Should have waited until EOD

I'ld inject it before market close and just hold it long term. Whatever happens AH, just remember: Stonks only go uppp
lol i panic sold once it broke 44. still profited off my fomo calls
This didn‚Äôt age well today
You might be right - but no one ever went broke taking profit
Is NIO going sub 40 by 3:30???
Best I can do is the stratosphere
Bawn **JORNO**
In theory, except NIOs fluctuations are too wild, it‚Äôs regularly doing plus/minus 7%
Something Citron released
Ooh concessions? Can I get a ü•®?
see them when I leave an extra dollar in your mom's g string.
This candle forming on the NIO weekly chart is the most bearish thing I've seen in a long time. This thing is done
After getting obliterated by TSLA I‚Äôll never look forward to a stock split again ü§°
Doesn't seem like it but you know how it likes to rip up or down in seconds lately
I think so too but then it'll probably be back down by Monday.
I'm in same boat as you. Also bought some VIX calls.  I think we head to the bottom of the range.
NIO please hit $40 today so I can dump my puts
Printing? Lmao
So just need SPY to pull a NIO and im in business!
PLTR's current price of $15.45-15.55 has been cryogenically frozen and will be unthawed in the year 3020 when covid has finally been eradicated.
That is a long shot buddy, best of luck.
RIP
I have Netflix hoping for lockdowns again

Earnings next week:

b - before market, a - after market

Mon - JD (b), BIDU (a)

Tue - HD (b), ARMK (b), HD (b), JKS (b), SE (b), WMT (b), NIO (a)

Wed - LOW (b), TGT (b), NVDA (a), SONO (a)

Thu - CSIQ (b), M (b), HP (a), MCFE (a)

If you hurry, you can follow me on my next plays.

She‚Äôs breaking through supports left and right. Take your tendies, drop the NIO anchor and get back in when it‚Äôs at a reasonable price. Or find a new stock, seriously, it‚Äôs not looking good fam.
Buying plug at 25 this morning is the easiest money I‚Äôve ever lost

Hopefully yeah. But still which would you recommend
$15k-ish isnt exactly gainporn worthy. Might be gain jcpenny bra ad worthy but I would hardly call it pornog.

Wtf man, why‚Äôd u sell
How much you want to bet that Citron opened NIO short positions that closed today and bought shorts on the runup for cheap and then released their report this morning to reap tendies on Friday?


Dudes trying to shake out the calls.
True but then you‚Äôre going up against pajamatraders that have a considerable leg up on most people here. And it takes serious collateral.
MMs crushed NIO hearts and now trying to push Dow to new record.
Yeah dump AAPL and SQ and pump...Dillards and Nordstrom... no thanks
Nope cause I switch to puts sorry
Only cool if you bought them seconds before the green dildo popped in
Why does this happen every single time that I buy...
I‚Äôm loaded with spy puts too fuck it lol
Lmao
Ok Citron, you win. Sold my call for like 16% instead of 270%. Wild ride. Should‚Äôve kept üíéüëãüèª in hindsight obviously but I‚Äôm done gambling. Back to theta gang
All up to earnings after citron
What a volume on NIO.
Buy TSLA sub $400 and sell at 420.69 

Easy money üí∞üí∞
They should post awesome numbers next quarter but it doesn‚Äôt seem to want to break $120. It‚Äôs just been consolidating forever.
Guys. Imagine a stock split on baba. 8 to 1
Buy more puts right now to make up the loss
You ever heard of stop losses my friend? They saved my tendies this morning and I got out only a few minutes after the peak. Since robinhood (and I think most platforms) only do limit stops and no trailing stops for options, just update them each morning if you're bullish or at EOD if you're bearish. Just gotta watch out for after-hours gap downs which might skip over your stop price and no one is buying for your ask because it dropped so far

Bought 2 yesterday for .67 then it opened at .15 this morning. I sold at the first 44 test for 1.65 and now its trading at 3.40. Left 500 on the table smh should have let it run
saturday?

Luckin coffee topped out at $50 also... just saying
Okay, now we've gone full retard.
NIO resserection
Look at it this way, if you just ignore what you bought it for...you've made at least $1 on every contract :D
4shares at $49
There's always more margin üåù
Real retard energy coming from this post
Citron was one of the biggest pumpers of China EV's and they bailed out saying the valuation is insane and a $25 price target is fair
This shit not even Chinese. It literally says Korean tea in English on the label.
Bring NIO back to $2!
If you can day trade them then yes. I can see a 2 percent day for the usual Monday gap up
I‚Äôm still profitable. So wanna know if stock is anyone‚Äôs long term bet or not?
Yeah... Tomorrow
same. honestly i've been trying to get rid of them through covered calls and haven't succeeded yet. and i dont have the heart to just sell them off directly since i've had atvi since 2012.
I‚Äôve got plantair at 16.7, should I dump now or hold long term. It seems pretty stable. Another stupid move by me ü§°ü§°

Should I sell my BYND puts now?

Green for the day because of NIO puts. Red all time still. Balanced as all things should be.
I'm waiting for the Luckin Coffee style rug pull
NIO is now around where it opened the week. As long as you weren't an idiot that went YOLO on weeklies you should be fine. The collective EV hype drove price way up and the Citron article made people panic sell but majority of shareholders are still institutions. Support will reflect that going into ER. If they beat earnings it may cause another FOMO run before NIO day but long term it shouldn't be less than $40. This is a good time to buy in if you legitimately believe this is the Chinese TSLA
Made 600% gain and ~3k+ today. I should‚Äôve never gotten calls :/
maybe calls, with trumps operation warp speed and upcoming mrna news
the loss porn is gonna be crazy today
Markets up bigly
To be fair the only green position in my port today is a theta play...
I sold 11 of them :(
[deleted]
For sure. But uppies or downies is the million dollar question
I bet you wish you actually did this
Better be covered calls
Yeah if you count the alleged illegal votes
Who all bought NIO at the top? Come now, I know I'm not the only one.
Lol nope. RIP - NIO 54
I BETTER FUCKIN SEE THE NIO LOSS PORN
How can one PDF tank NIO. Crazy. Maybe it was overpriced after all.
Yeah I'm no english native speaker so I wasn't sure what it's called. So which one do you use for example?
CCL had a public offering of shares as soon as the stock went up a few dollars at the start of the week. If that doesn't tell you the state of these Cruiselines. I don't know what does.
lol why am I loaded up on SPY Puts... guh! lol should've just went with the scarier play... NIO puts
U cant even remember the time I've seen something more retarded.
You convinced me bought 3K worth of shares for quick tendies let's see..
Do they report before or after market?
NIO earnings on 11-17. Will it run up on Monday?
Tomorrow is Saturday
I doubt it will, considering tomorrow the markets are closed.
They hurt so good

I just want someone to superimpose Kamala Harris‚Äô face on a koala and shade the whole thing shrek green. 

Meme that Green Energy Kamala Bear.
NIO is fRee mOnEy
Nice put play, but that 60c is gonna hurrtt. All EVs are down today and that's expiring in MAY?! Bro you're gonna sit through 2 earnings reports and NIO day and you think it won't reach $60 by May?
Haha with $91B... assuming the position didn‚Äôt take over 25% of the total market cap it limits the companies... my guess is the company is Apple and it‚Äôs a click bait title saying Apple is a 5G play cause of their new phone which although wrong is not necessarily false
Sold for profit üòâ
I guess NIO is fighting agent Smith.
That feeling when even going into NKLA would have been better than NIO calls

Askin a lil fukin late bud
Nio puts*
Do I sell my $41 NIO shares I bought Wednesday or do I hold over weekend hoping for earnings bounce?
Honestly guys just take it "easy" and trade the futures. No theta, easy to model risk/reward, overnight exposure. Just simple.
The weekend of lockdown announcements
Fucking hell
Pfizer is a ‚Äúsus‚Äù company now it seems.
Bruh, nio is down yeah, but its been down for what, 3 hours so far? Check back in when nio drops continuously through ER, then I'll give you props
Writing covered calls that are now going to have to be far OTM, with lowered IV will make me a certified bag holder with low premiums.

Brutality.
ZM gonna pump next week after virus numbers sink in?
Ffs.   Learn the basics of trailing stop loss orders.  You don't have to constantly watch a stock all day everyday to keep resetting your stop loss level. Computers can do that for you if you'd just master the art of trailing stop losses. Everyone spends time buying, but far few try to master the art of getting good at exiting and setting conditional brackets.  Nio would have been the perfect stock to set a conditional order on while it was running so that you could have found the top and sold before the tremendous drop.
Puts?
That's power to the people
One article of a dude saying NIO isn‚Äôt worth a buy and y‚Äôall just jump ship. I‚Äôm long on this bitch. Take me to $100
Make a profit % and take take take. Live to fight another day you fucking idiot
Anyone know how to recover from a -69% loss today?
shit the partnership announced 2 days ago? Bouta pump?
he didn‚Äôt sell. last update 20 mins ago he said still up 50k

it dropped another 2 dollars in last 20 mins. he prob up 20-30k range now
Yeh suits probably will pump it to squeeze shorts, calls are likely going to hit simply bc you are in the minority rn
SELL! SELL! SELL!
buying calls at the top, selling at the bottom. the wsb way
SPY puts??
NIO stock holders, y‚Äôall staying in? Or cutting ur loses real quick?
PDD are u kidding me.. look at this sleeper flying into outer space
I bet NIO bounces back real nice tomorrow at open (pls)
üò¥ won georgia -they're calling it
Ya'll still talking about Nio, ya'll need to learn to let it goooo
i've done more retarded things than bought .1 delta weeklies
That's called a buying opportunity. üòéü§£

NIO HOMOS SEETHING LOL
Only thing substantially up for me today  is solo
It can be a disaster for sure, especially weeklies.
uh yeah JD, buddy, look, just pretend you are value for today. How does that sound?
This sounds reasonable
Imagine buying NIO at $54 lmaooo
Fuck yes i did at open then got 0dte puts at 45. Fuck me too easy. Done w NIO now
what a ride today has been. fun now very much not fun.
Guys someone please close the market .... my nio calls are dead
$NACP ?
ccl looks like a 10 bagger play
Bottom dude is is trying to pump and dump and is a bottom.

Top dude is a retard who thinks that we listen to smart brains and is also a bottom.

NIO -13%, what a shock!
Need a $100 play for next week cmon retards, winner gets $10
same. and it feels so shit

THE GREED
Is he sure that wasn't coke?
watch NIO bounce back bigly after burning all the degenerates
This should go on the back of an eddie bauer t-shirt.
Ironically NKLA is up today. Thing won't die
Usually bearish, but read the Pfizer website. 3rd week of November the FDA comes out with its reports and peer reviews. Short squeeze again for travel and non covid stocks
Thank you.
Good luck man, I was looking at IWM puts earlier. Wish I had that kind of capital to play with. You got it!
Ok that's kind of funny . Take my like

CBAT is next wsb move from NIO. US corona cases are up and we have a chinese lithium company with a ticker called CoronaBAT. there's simply no way to lose. no need for DD
FAFO
I‚Äôm only gay for NIO! Burn baby burn üî•
Rough day
Yep pretty much how it works. Buy expiration further out in the future and it won‚Äôt fall dramatically like that.

I will get some Bullet Bourbon!
Any other NIO bulls stoked on this drop? I can get back in at a price that I want. $50 resistance? Who's that. $45 resistance? Never heard of 'em. $40 resistance? Bob's your uncle

The call prices are tanking, puts are up, does this mean any potential downside from earnings will be hard to gain value with a put, come Tuesday? I have a feeling with this pullback, people are gonna be more hesitant since it can swing pretty wildly and isn't a total "stonks only go up," so the retail investors probably aren't going to make this surge as fast as it just did but I think short puts until earnings then long calls might be the way to go.
How many of you diamond handing nio calls?
I‚Äôm sure it would but I don‚Äôt think the affect will be that pronounced in either direction
*brokerage
RIP, it's all good we'll get those gains back after the earnings  üòé
nice
Even tho I sold my NIO calls yesterday, today still hurt
who lost money today üòéü§ù
Your silly if you don‚Äôt think imma yeet everything I got at NIO. Very nice dip to buy
So, aNIOways, are people buying on this dip?
Can‚Äôt get in, single seater BS.
Same, bought the top with a 12/11 50C
Lol to be fair citron research was done by Andrew Left. He defended  luckin coffee at $60 pt. 

But pretty happy. I‚Äôd be a buyer around the low to mid 30s. It‚Äôs been trading on momentum since then
Yea always straddle the risky ones
I got downvoted so hard for saying to short NIO lmao
Guy I work with keeps booing cruises and they get cancelled. How did this shit pump? ü§£
One of my biggest losses was from selling TSLA calls when it ran up (pre-split)
Is ivr leaps good sir
This didn't age well
NIO chart starting to look like NKLA
While I appreciate the joke, looking at the six month chart, clearly there is no evidence that the stock can't appreciate.
Why though.
down 1.5k on nio, it's over
i wouldve thought the pullback was on monday but i guess not

Fomo is always the best strategy, thats how you find the top!

lol me too, don't sell it for a loss, hold it till next week if your holding Nov 18/27 calls
Nov 20? I may have bought them.
Loo
My nio fds are done
Also Increased my holdings on the recent retrace, my long exposure is much larger now. I didn‚Äôt take offense so didn‚Äôt see you as a Dick. This game is play differently for many people. Everyone has their own winning style. This is how I play. Some People would settle for a rental shore house In WildWood NJ (Wall Street movie reference just in case you are too young and didn‚Äôt get that). Maybe it was my mistake for posting here on Reddit. seems like everyone here is a Robinhood person or a green newbies. No offense to you if you are one, if you are not then you know where I am coming from, Be well. Later
Update -14%. Too late for the other half of the globe to short this shit so maybe they will pump it overnight.
The world is ending!!! NIO stock is back to levels not seen since Wednesday!!!! Market crashing!!!!
This is what I would do, however all my cash is in PLTR rn

NIO puts üòç
Keep in mind this is the same company that came guns blazing at Tesla and Shopify. Andrew Left is a sad poser and deserves no credibility.
I am down for the day instead of up 3k
yea it means there was no one stupid enough to buy them before but now there is
Anyone playing SOLO? Lots of unusual options activity just now. Mostly calls. Cheap EV stock which I‚Äôm not usually a fan of but it‚Äôs only $6 a share for stocks
Well fuck My calls
The ones he didnt like, so all of them üòÇ
It opened the week at ~$41.50 and low was in the high $38s when it pulled back earlier this week. Support should be somewhere in that range.
ahahaha thanks for your money stupid americans, China numba one üá®üá≥üá®üá≥üá®üá≥üá®üá≥
I'm thinking a Monday push followed by a loss of momentum end of week. 45 by next friday
A new generation of XPEV and Nio bag holders were just born
What do you mean not today?  The calls are the same price as they were this morning when it was $49
NIO we hardly nio you

RIP
MM will push spy to 362, get your calls now

Edit* 362+++would not be surprised to see 380 soon
I love that you‚Äôre making a stink about like 1 black owned company yet you‚Äôll go ape shit over chinese stocks.
go for it. i've seen crazier strategies on this sub.
Was probably a good move. I'm too deep in BABA so instead I'm doubling down.
Y'all better get into PFE before its vaccine gets EUA...
Time to buy?
vaccine talks keeping boomer spy afloat
Buy calls on both

And thats why you shouldnt invest in chinese stock except BABA.

And made a lot of money
Let‚Äôs all win lottos and buy nio calls at 3:00 real quick, I‚Äôm so smart
Those fuckers at Citron can just print cash whenever the fuck they feel like it.
Crazy how a four-paragraph document that looks like, yet has less factual data than a middle-school science fair project can do that to a stock. Wild.

Jesus what a tank job on NIO
scary as fuck, but nio is at 10 day vwap, could get a bounce....
Lmfao
Why is ACB trading sideways

Removed NIO from watchlist and had to refrain myself from visiting wsb this morning to not fall for the FOMO. Boy Im glad I did
lol NIO going to 40 EOD
Does anyone pay for the CNBC "pro" content?  Is there anything more useful there than what I get for free on wsb?
I believe in you 357.4 resistance
Identity politics is the most virtue signaling racist crap ever. I‚Äôll never feed into such nonsense.
Yes that NIO 11/13 55c never hit.
I knew I should‚Äôve bought NIO puts.. guh
Bulls trying to rationalize the NIO drop as MMs just trying to screw put holders is sad. It‚Äôs an overvalued company that went on a monstrous run. This is an overdue correction. You just got greedy holding your calls.
Going to tendie town ü§†
Nio at same price as last Friday.
You guys all sold out of NIO this morning, right? You guys all knew that they were at an unsustainable level and were going to pull back, right? Of course you did! This place is full of cautious and intelligent investors who don't mind leaving a few dollars on the table as long as it means locking in profits. Im proud of you guys!

Why cry about nio when you could buy fsr
Can we do it via SPAC or ICO?
Edit: added March $420C
GUH was up 7k today since starting and after the NIO crash I'm -5k
Well that‚Äôs another expensive lesson, I should‚Äôve taken profit on my Nio 50c. RIP to what could‚Äôve been

Same dude, I only bought 1x $40 put yesterday, thank fuck I didn't panic dump it this morning.

Not really that much money, but enough for me to throw it away on a bottle of Yamazaki

Is the stock price of berkshire hathaway (BK) correlated with Apple? Say, I think the new cpus save Apple money and help their profits. Can I buy calls on BK (having 40% in Apple invested)?
Could you explain to us retards what this means plz
[deleted]
I have been just selling covered calls since Q2, mainly weeklies or a couple weeks out. Not even close to being assigned once...
Don't let the NIO dropping distract you from SPY mooning.

If you actually look at citron‚Äôs nio report, it looks like a sophomore in high school made it on the shitter the night before the due date hahahaa
I just bought 10 contracts and the bid price just shot up. Did I just manipulate a stock?
How them calls?
Looks like my grandma portfolio full of bonds
LMAO they really took NIO to 54
got my leaps

Once again proving you‚Äôre a butthurt fucking weirdo lmao dunno why you got so upset
Your poor nio got fucked bitch puts be printing harder cunt
40. I'm literally erect.
Used car appreciated like $1k more than I bought it for. It's not a great purchase but i did my research
holy fuck do i feel attacked. Canadian remembrance day was a blur
Lost 1.5k on my nio gains.

Hopefully i can keep my hands in my pocket

NIO going back to the shadow realm
Does anyone know where I can stream the Masters??

I‚Äôll be sippin tea In your hood
Sold it literally 5 seconds later when I saw it break into 42. Only lost a couple bucks.
Let‚Äôs start  WSB EV company with no designs or assets and take it public. We can cash out by next Friday after we dump it on these fucks.

Well I missed out on 3k by selling my NIO puts way too soon. Happens every time...
And?
Hope your nio calls ate shit today.
Lol these fucking companies are delivering 5k vehicles a month. The valuation is actually retarded. NIO was like the 6th most valuable car company when it hit its peak. NIO+XPEV+LI were combined valued more than GM+Ford+FCA. Everyone‚Äôs trying to ride the next Tesla wave. I got out of my shares first thing this morning up 3.5k. Fuck it. I‚Äôll buy back in when they‚Äôre back down to 20-30. The most retarded thing is Li is probably the most promising out of the 3, but everyone is on NIOs dick for whatever reason.

NIO (NIO) drops to levels unseen since Wednesday
:/
Look. NIO was a great trade $30 ago but at the end of the day, TSLA is growing 60% faster in China. Everyone is always trying to find the next Tesla but in the end, they get Nikola‚Äôd.
It always eventually reaches 420 might as well but now
Yes EOD pump for no reason please
Probably

Buy 100 shares on GME yes or no?
It has too much attention and people waiting for entry points imo
I made 160% profit, sold at 53 lmao. Eat my cock.
What a disgusting crash from NIO , I sympathise with the ones who FOMO‚Äôd the top
I was gonna say his manhood
I'm torn. Definitely bad virus news over the weekend, but moderna might drop that vaccine news too. I have spy puts and mrna calls, so hopefully covered either way
Nio puts were such a no brainer play this morning everyone loses sight of the big picture so quickly by fomo
This is funny because I bought a NIO call this morning at opening. It triggered my limit making me exactly $100 which I turned around and bought a $40 put with. Stonks!
I meant in the same sense as water resistant, not proof.

Just some blood types have a harder time than others, but when I googled it that second time I didn‚Äôt find anything about it.
Jesus green everyday day all day
And it‚Äôs retard strength that powers these EV stocks
NIO CHOMOS ABSOLUTELY SEETHING AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
I don't need it to hold up to scrutiny. Just a meme stock caught in a trend with the rest of the EVs. I simply went in because of NIO's earnings on the 17th. Was thinking this might run up until then?
Fine wine...
Well, totally out of NIO now.  Time for it to runnup.  Missed out on a few K in potential profits, but made about 4k still on a fairly small position

NIO is for Diamond Hands only. TSLA at $40 without China market not too long ago. Pepperidge Farm remembers.

Same company that shorted square and it went on to double 3 months later lol
My ‚Äúnight off‚Äù from drinking is drinking only 6 beers...

Jeff Amazon is not
Went from 2k up to 3k down today. This is ok.

Yes nio, die.

Fuck Cintron the analyst named Left also said NVIDIA and Tesla were overpriced several years ago. He‚Äôs more retarded than we are
#nio2zero
And the double not going so well at the moment!
HAHA saaaaame!!
I thought she was part of the inventory.

Which one of you is Andrew Left?
yea pfe jumped from 38.17 to 38.40 in like mins.
GODDAMMIT I'm about to revenge buy puts on CNK.   
Actually not, I have learned my lesson about doubling down on stupid positions.
I wish I bought more NIO puts.

vaccine pump from moderna soon
LYFT was down also due to the California gig law but now that prop 22 has passed it is moot.
STOP THE COUNT REEEEEE
Damn Nio chill
dude, so ur calls are down like what, 70%? i know cuz i had so much leverage in feb and march calls, and got fucked silly
Big gap down that could see it at 35.  Monday will be interesting
Same. Sucks but gains is gains. You live to fight another day
all in on nio cuz this guy on stonktwits said its going to $60 next week and he got 25 likes
Get out while you can.
Low key might pick up Nio calls monday before earnings if it keeps dropping.
Favorite stock under $20 right now other than PK?
Power hour dump or pump?
That‚Äôs all they have left ü§°ü§≥üèª

RemindMe! Ten years "call this guy a retard"
Don't do that.
Um A shape ??? ü§ûüèΩ
Liar
Just be glad you didn‚Äôt have calls like the rest of the window lickers here
well at least my NIO puts saved me from my SPY puts lmao
Only reason I upvoted was to hit that 69.
Holy shit is that what dd means? I always assumed it meant to double down.
Is there a chance NIO won't close at 55 today?
Figured I‚Äôd go peek at the NIO chart, lmao. Hope you boys sold
What PT are you hoping for in those 5? I'm holding long too
When it drops further?
Alright everyone on the SPY coaster put your hands up in the air and say *AAAA^(AAA^AA^A)!*
is spy going to drop even with stimulus news coming?
next week gonna suck 


‚Äúreality hits you hard bro‚Äù

(coulda been a camaro)
Damn I have puts on NIO and even I feel bad for the call holders lmfao. Ring the bell!

that last SPY bull just saved me so much money

Thought I got puts at the bottom this AM...turns out it wasn't the bottom. Big brain moves.
You, sir, are a true spud
Over 200% now
Well it started at like $4 right?  Maybe it will stop there 
üòú
Oh god no I don't want to
Mt. Neo had a beautiful peak.  I visited it once.  Hope I get to see it again before I die financially.

Must be getting old. In my day would have girlfriend touch something else to get it red.   


WTF is wrong with you all?
Major OOF there, I bought more when it lowered to 47 because most days have had a dip then raise. Don‚Äôt listen to all the bears here posing as bulls saying it will raise again. I‚Äôll believe it when I see it! I‚Äôll hold for now because I‚Äôm great at making bad decisions
This is the weakest, small-peepee pump day on SPY I‚Äôve seen in a while. Time to double down on puts
why was i such a pussy.. god damn nio bears what lambo?
Wait for it to collapse like a dying star? I'm here for a good time not a long time
ATVI will be at $78 on march 21st
You'd be surprised
Nothing wrong with doubling ur money.
Bryson takes so fucking long to hit the ball
That‚Äôs some pump and dump on CBAT.
Up 44% on no news
I sold 100 nio puts for about 115 each, 20 mins later there going for 300 a pop, fml
Yahoo comments sections are more toxic then mw2 lobbies don‚Äôt @ me
AYO Home Depot fellers, didnt yall say earlier that theres massive call buying for earnings next week? i been bleeding on this option since the election lol
pe ratio over 500????
Btw, thanks for obliterating my inbox
Perfect. I'm pickin up shares.
What is the operation warp speed update? Calls on travel over the weekend?
I‚Äôd be back in NIO in the mid 30s before that parabolic run happened
Michigan and Arizona, right?
Did almost the exact same thing lol. Thought we hit bottom and then panicked out of my calls
Worst part is I tried to jump back into some more when it was -3% but I got PDT restricted...TDA just lost me at least $500
It ain‚Äôt a loss til ya sell
Where is tsla going to go. It's been stagnant for weeks and has been dropping
except he's self made and his family doesn't own an African diamond mine lol

Covid spiking and lockdown talk = PTON tanking. Makes sense
This is the top, gentlemen.

*lights cigar*
That's a GUH of the highest order.
Aww dammit, I knew it was flawed. What did I get wrong?
Delayed coronavirus vaccine news. Hints that Moderna is going to pan out as well as the announced Pfizer one are good signs.
HAHAHAHA LOOK AT NIO GO DOWN
how low of puts should i buy?
Position?
Who manufactures the car for them? Think I'll invest there
I haven't decided what to do yet, but things don't look too good for next week. That hit piece really pulled the legs out of that rally. Fucking Citron.
NIO just keeps dropping. Should‚Äôve got more puts.
No shit
Got burned way to many times with this exact thinking.
Thats it NIO

Drill for pappa

I only bought 1 put but I need it to go like 50,000% so if it hits $5 I will make so much money
Rip
Google their sales cracker ass bitch
Apple amazon PayPal lulu pissing me off ode
My mind tells me sell before the ER sell off. I got hurt my PLTR with this so I've learnt my lesson
Things were so different before ‚Äúthe vaccine‚Äù
It‚Äôs a March 21 contract. We‚Äôll see.
Just a matter of time. Far dated spy puts as a hedge bleeding  but 366 is the top for a while
Same, glad I sold calls and raked in so much premium. The only thing I wish is that I got a better price on reinvesting my credit. We may get back down to 25-30's soon.
eeeeeeee boooghttt? dammpt it
Vaccine next week baby boy
Oh dude that sucks, just think how melted your face could have been.
Sweater made of vomit
LOOL get fucked bitch
Nio is gonna finish -20%
Nio \\ shaped recovery
Lol
Absolutely.  Was gonna write some covered calls but I think I‚Äôll wait until midweek after it gaps up Monday
Bruh, that 11/16 is gonna bleed 2/3 of its extrinsic value due to theta decay over the weekend and then when the day comes to sell, a lot of people can't buy 0dte options (depending on their platform), which limits your potential to offload that if it went the wrong way. Gatorade that for an 11/18 today at least so you don't get ruined by theta decay and can sell on monday
Imagine if covid killed 10% or more
Shareholders aren't fazed. This isn't even close to NIO's biggest drop and we have earnings coming up Tuesday. We'll be fine. Just another day in the office.
Got a little BIDU before the spike

God what a relief it would be. Then we wouldn‚Äôt have to hear his asinine ramblings anymore
yeah i think so. pre earnings run up next week is possible catalyst. as far as I'm seeing its just this Citron downgrade that is the reason for the sell off, caused panic and now the paper hands are leaving
Diamond hands
Jesus i am in all the wrong fucking tickers lol. Market is big green. I am big redü§°
I did the opposite in April and sold 10 shares of AMZN at 2040 and bought 15 shares GOOGL for 1050. Sold the google at 1570. Still kicking myself
Prob right
Didn‚Äôt lose any money but my profits just got nuked
I like how people on WSB told me buying some puts on NIO when it rallied to 42% in 3 days and making money on it is a lotto play , but them buying calls on NIO at 54 wasn't a lotto at all... and that I only made money because a "fraud" downgraded it because it rallied 42% in 3 days...
TSLA is growing 60% faster in China than NIO so yeah. I prefer the real deal and not some cheap knockoff. 

NIO is valued at $1.2m per car. That‚Äôs a bit dumb. It was a great trade $30 ago though. I‚Äôll give you that.
Eurorich is going to have to come in and clean up the Ameripoors mess tonight
Earlier today I took Nio off my watch list cause it hurt seeing how hard it mooned & I didn‚Äôt want to succumb to FOMO. hmm
Rebound for nio? Is a straddle a good play?

I agree with you 100%, but you're forgetting that ATVI as a stock is absolute trash.  Shit just bounces between 78 and 82 regardless of record sales, player counts etc.

Just so you retards are aware. A 20% drop in NIO is not the same as a 20% rise.
do people even realize NIU is not the same as NIO?

Stonks up because Mango lost his ballot appeals üòÇ
Are you seriously using data from 2018 to talk about covid and comparing the 1-44 age group to the 25-34 bracket? That's beyond stupid. Your second link literally days influenza and pneumonia killed 1.86k people in 2018 between 1-44, while your first link says COVID has killed already more than 6.2k people on the same age group, with some possible fails in testing. Your links literally contradict your reply. Influenza killed around 500 people younger than 44 this year.

> , that only applies if you have the genes and habits to make it to 80 in the first place

Yes you fucking dense human being, the people that are dying from COVID are dying because they are ALIVE, therefore they had the genes to reach that age. Look at the ridiculous amount of excess deaths. They weren't going to die from other causes.

Dear Joe Biden,

"premarket" should not exist.  It's just a way for institutions to screw us plebs.  Executive order nothing gets fucking traded at all before or after the fucking bell.
Not in this name for times and nickels. If that is what your goal is then take it, it‚Äôs yours. I thinking bigger, much bigger
I meant it was also a rotation we did this week lol
Did anyone actually read the article? There is absolutely nothing in there... just that NIO doesn't have a huge market share and TSLA's model Y pricing could potentially disrupt them... Clearly, last night's pump was manipulated... and then this news is dropped is no coincidence. I find it funny how everyone gets irrational when we knew everything in that article forever ago...
long dated ZM puts seem like free money
Rotation in to boomer stocks huh

[deleted]
It‚Äôs true it was so tempting to short nio but the IV so high. Cannot short these stocks, but you know eventually this sub will regret it. I am pretty happy with myself I bought a leap on nio while this sub was blowing it up. Yesterday people here got wayyy too bullish with their predictions. People were getting tons of upvotes saying nio would be 100 EOW. I bounced out at close yesterday when I seen that.
Kind of think the opposite in after hours.  Watch out for a Trump pump on vaccines at close.
This
Now that election's over with, considering going more thetagang. Tired of trying to time the bottom and getting burnt every day
Yup I'm buying the dip for now
You guys dumping your NIO shares also?
Got outta NIO at $45.  Hope I don‚Äôt regret that call next week.
me too....i can't stop buying when it goes up. help
APHA still not in US but will enter soon (just acquired sweetwater brewery). Israel looking like it will legalize soon (just signed a distribution deal there). üöÄif ya ask me

Yo I literally just tested the cosmos and bought a worthless SPY put for funsies

Guess what happened to SPY

I think I actually understand how religions and superstitions are formed
That didn't happen. Georgia is doing a hand recount starting TODAY. It will be done on 11/20.
Buy the dip
You‚Äôre optimistic about BABA?
exactly wtf are these rich people smoking?

fucking fire of course

The market is forward looking. It's expecting everything will be fine 5 years from now so SPY 500.
all those chips for the vaccines
what the fuck is going on
I mean I thought BA an hour ago but they keep going up
Yep same and looking at watchlist really hard to see how that is.  GOOG and FB seem to be the big guys and FB just barely.  Everything else...
Since GME is paying off debt.  Are we going to see a credit upgrade before or after earnings?

Nio
Ugh I am just annoyed that I forgot to set a Limit sell for some of my Calls. They're date for May but they doubled and I was too busy playing fuckin' God of War.
You Nio cucks deserve this for betraying papa Elon !
+1% from its weekly open? Lol
I didn't realize I had a ticket to the moon
IT'S ALREADY PRICED IN BITCH
It does this 2/3 of the Fridays
Usually on earnings for stocks like these they return to a fairer value since traders who looked to get a short return on it have left.

Why is zoom dying?

lol, imagine being gifted the move in this stupid stock and not knowing when to get out. are you back at 0 yet?
Calls are doing great, thought you‚Äôd want to know
That's weird. Your long call should act as collateral. Nonetheless, I see it going up on Monday if JD crushes its earnings so I would just hold it lol
FSR is a pump and dump.

GUHH!!!
It was a single (citron) news so far + profit taking.  
Xpev, nio, li, same charts.  
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs more a *temporary* political play rather than bad fundamentals, especially given earnings so far. + tsla mm aren‚Äôt very happy atm. If temporary, it will reverse and moon.
  
Tl;dr: not hertz - but only guesstimating atm.
I know how it feels to be recouping losses but hold out.
New to trading
Not sure if waiting is going to happen, I feel the big green dick of Daddy Ma heading our way soon.
This is the first dip.
Should have stuck with with all american WMT
My dog took a piss on the floor and it looked like TSLA symbol.  Good enough for me.

As a very special retard, what forms should you be looking at to evaluate a foreign company like NIO? I did some digging but never found a 10k
Really? I just scrapped 20k on Nio puts so maybe I'll tickle some rly OTM spy calls for monday. thanks dad
ok Elon.
If you take any serious investment advice from r/wallstreetbets you‚Äôre a fucking idiot.

Best part was that I figured it would go down but I decided to wake up at 9 instead of 10 to check it. It was up so I put all of my money into it, wake up at 10, it‚Äôs down by 20%
Not Ho Lee Fuk? üöÄüöÄ
I think I timed it really nicely. It was down 12.5% and it's hard to see it going lower than 40 at least for me \*shrugs\*
Didn‚Äôt realize I fat fingered & bought 3x as many NIO puts as I thought. Well, nice when u make 3x the profit on accident. The only way to make it ever. Cause u never can when I try. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You could be up over 100% this month like me :)
Especially on something that kept going up 5-10% everyday for a week. A kid I work with has shares and I told him to get ready to sell when it crosses 50 then let it drop and buy back in. Doubt he listened though. He paid 30 for his shares though
I bought more. We'll see next week, I have a feeling you're right
It's only one pair, you get to keep the one pair. I thought this was a good faith negotiation???

Fuck I was so worried that the plague was going to hurt the stock market. Thank goodness that isn't the case.
Hop on the TGT train, ER on Wed
This right here.  By the time a meme has saturated the daily at 50% or more of the posts, it's over.  Stay away from it.  Don't try to short it either, you're going to be fighting roos, and you can't win against roos.
Not gonna lie, this one hurts my brain
Leveraged miners etfs bull/bear both got wiped out in March due to volatility. It was a bloodbath. Still interested though.
Pump you son of a bitch QQQ. I need this day trade to net me a little so I can feel like today has been productive staring at numbers and graphs instead of napping!
Big gay for not adding GME in there.

I was going to the first pic at around 10am because I was so proud I had dug myself out of a $5k hole to become profitable all-time again. 

Then, the citron report came out and as you can see what happened in the second picture I am once again at an all-time loss. 

It‚Äôs cool. I think I should rebound at the beginning of next week.

Well Elon actually exists in 2 states simultaneously.

SPY melt up is beginning. Was talking about it a bit in the daily thread this week. Even though I am a bear, we‚Äôre still in a bubble, and the bubble wants to get bigger. SPY is going to melt up to new ATHs for next couple weeks at least

I actually saw it shooting up and sold some other stock and bought a little bit more at 53 hoping to sell by the end of the day with a slight rise and fuck
I sold NIO put $42 for $20 earlier when NIO fell to $48 and just bought it back at $90 to avoid assignment. Good lord Nio you scary

I'll take your word for it. The recert alone should get it past 200 to try and retest 230. Look at it AH tonight if it moons further then it will happen and then pull back. Otherwise back to 158 it is.

I'd sell half, that way if it goes down u still made profit while if it goes up you still have the other half to make extra profit out of
They do a lot more than gamer graphics cards. They have an ai moat with cuda tech and are making big data center gains. That said they killed earnings last 2 times and last time they had good guidance and still dropped.

Careful with SOLO, penny stock bag holders have been waiting for sweet release for a LONG time.

The store location they opened up in Portland is literally just a kiosk in a mall with one of their shitty cars. Shit company, shit car. Look at the specs on that, none of that is going to stand up to scrutiny once this hype dies off and mark my works it is dying now.

Lmao NIO be like battery day 2.0
Bought SBRCY (largest bank in Russia) a month ago for my IRA because it was (and still is) fairly down and looked like it had a lot of upside potential. Recently discovered it has like a 9% dividend. Also have to pay some dumb foreign tax and a management fee to hold it but they didn't amount to much. Probably a great long hold for retirement accounts if anyone is interested in that lame sort of thing.
Nice
okay BYND this isn‚Äôt funny anymore I don‚Äôt want to be assigned
The only thing making me feel better about not buying NIO puts at 52 is knowing people panic sold theirs this morning.

We're going back to 50 by Wednesday

Can we just go back to arguing about politics instead of no-content NIO comments all the time?
Citron was fucked by shorting tsla, shop, zm, and more.

If all the countermeasures work then we will be looking at something close to the old normal in about eighteen months. People are going to try really really hard to get out of this situation.
The fact that you're truly just not understanding anything anyone is saying to you in this comment thread, repeating the force fed garbage you've heard about "ya'll are just scaredy cats haha" and yet claiming that WE'RE the brainwashed ones is peak fucking irony m8.

These tests aren't meant to tell you if yo have covid full stop. They're meant to give a rapid idea of whether a PCR test should be implemented. Stop spreading information you clearly know very little about.

Exactly. Given a choice, everyone will still jump into it. I personally know one of my friends who just drops hate comments here on NIO but keeps discussing the entry point. Lmao
Some tard lost his ass on NIO and is downvoting every post.
Thanks for the middle finger pattern AAPL

So NFLX ends barely red today or green?

Yes! Buy the dip
Imagine thinking it wont rocket back on monday
NIO calls still expensive even though it dropped $5
Wanna pick up some 11/27 exp today
Same. Makes no sense at all, especially with lockdowns incoming.
Haha, no worries my dude. Use that advantage over us US folks and get you some tendies
I didn't buy lol. I bought a bunch of shares at 44.5 though
80% of my portfolio is in GE shares which I‚Äôve owned for six years now. Do you think it‚Äôll go back up? Cheers and happy trading - Mike
\[Serious\] Can someone give me a legitimate reason to be bullish on buying SPY calls right now?
NIO gang downvoting everything lmao
NIO 50 EOD mark my word
doesn't matter, it goes down hill AND uphill.  Way more practical than NKLA, the practical consumer will purchase it.
fuck citron till i die
I bought the dip yesterday.  This sucks balls.

Feels kind of reckless and incentivized to publish such a scathing report contrasting the markets motives... sounds like what happened with Tesla but musk ripped a new one
Not sure why you're making the assumption that I'm essentially a blue-pilled retard because I'm not going down the same political slippery slope as you.  

All I've done was point out that NIO is not implicated by the executive order after you told OP he should read it - seeming to suggest NIO IS implicated.  Stop deflecting and acting like your insight is anything more than tinfoil hat guesses about future geopolitical economics.

IDK who needs to feel better about themselves, but I sold NIO puts to start the day.
Zero volume or OI
I thought so until Monday. Who knows now. It'll go up maybe not to 600 :(
This is the nio dip to buy I swear üíÄ
I mean no ones really politically independent idk what you mean. I try to stay open minded tho even tho shits hella polarizing. Like fwiw I voted mango but supported/donated/phonebanked for Yang so I mean I try to see both sides
Just wait until earnings next week.
[deleted]
Yeah, when I saw it *break on through to the other side* into 42, I dropped it. Maybe next week will be better. Still plan to get in, but I think it's just going to drop through Tuesday/Wednesday

NIO goes up 12% one day: hmmmm such organic growth, i love it

NIO goes down 12% one day: EVERYONE LOSES THEIR FUCKING MINDS
Remember this morning when *everyone* was screaming to buy NIO calls
Can you imagine being the guy that sold 11/13 45p at 0.01 at open? 320 bagger from low to high.
Alright, $42 is the bottom, calling it
Nio doubled in a month, nice
Sell right before earnings
Buy nio
And now, after NIO was not the one, all of WSB rotates in to SOLO

*Morgan Freeman voice
good luck....i sold my $22C this morning for small profit....for the time & agrivation this stock caused not even worth it....
I hate to say it boys, but tech looks like it‚Äôs gonna be pretty bigly fucked for the short to mid term. There‚Äôs gonna be some serious shifting of valuations over the next few months. Don‚Äôt get caught holding the bag

Bull flag pattern formed on the 1 month and 3 month charts yesterday afternoon. 737 recertification supposed to be announced Wednesday. Plus moderna vaccine results very well could be released next week. The data was submitted for review yesterday and the analysis takes days not weeks to do.
Would have printed so hard
Indirectly, yes.

$NIO is listed on NYSE.  Their "home country" is the Cayman Islands.  NYSE allows listed companies to follow the rules of their "home country".  They are sheltered from US lawsuits, and their executives are sheltered from PRC income tax.

Since they are registered in the Cayman Islands, the PRC treats them as a foreign company.  Since the PRC is...well...a communist country... they have very tight restrictions on foreign businesses operating in their country.  In order to do business in the PRC, they had to create a subsidiary (NIO New Energy) - where they only own 50% stake, and they have absolutely no control over it.  This subsidiary is where all of their revenue is generated.  They are entitled to 50% of distributions and 50% responsible for their losses.  Since the PRC can make up new laws without publishing them, they are completely at the mercy of the PRC.  If the PRC doesn't want them to distribute gains, they deny their request to convert RMB to foreign currency (to pay shareholders).

In short - yes, China is going to eat your tendies whenever they feel like it.
LMAO who bought NIO at the top

Short seller Citron pulled an Elon and tweeted that NIO was way overvalued and should be $25 a share
Elon is talking about antigen test and you're talking about pcr rates retard
I'll likely buy more
I usually set mine as soon as I buy; -1-2% TS.  If it hits +10%, then I change it to -10% to give it more room to move since I've already protected my initial investment.  I totally f'd up with NIO (didn't implement the plan; tried playing catch-up) and lost \~$200 on 500 shares.
Fuck it. I'm going fishing and I won't be back until Monday morning.

He's been persona non grata for at least 2 years now. As in, he's been off the map due to pressure from CCP. Look into it.
HahahahHhahha
Its crazy to think that people are opposed to investing in NIO. The recent comments are just a bunch of NIO haters because of a dip when everyone just made big fucking dollars.

In Jack Ma we trust.
dope- let's do a banbet.
RKT
welcome to WSB
Institutions are still majority shareholders in NIO. Only a small percentage of outstanding shares are retail investors who will panic sell after hard corrections and drive the stock down further. Once shorts need to start covering at EOD the price will climb back up. Especially since it's the Friday before earnings. Definitely some algo manipulation going on, but it just takes another high valuation or great ER to shoot the price back up.
Good call, fuck Citron.
That ages well.
till it rips 7% in one day
It‚Äôs roughly 330% vs the average.
Risk/reward on these Chyna stonks wai tu lo.
This is probably the first civil war I‚Äôve seen in WSB.. the battle of NIO is an interesting one.
out of unproven, miniscule sales, no profit companys in China  - into actual functioning, profitable, & rona virus proof companys in China
lmao I'm so retarded
Gonna average down more at 3:59
Pretty much just means tutes are about to open the floodgates even further on the NIO flash sale...
Name checks out
Thanks. Stay safe.
I‚Äôve already put in a buy order for NIO at $13 which is still fucken expensive for this fad company.
You mean naggers?
SSSS $12?
NVDA earnings next week? Think pump to $600 right before ER?
Tim cucked my calls
im old enough to remember the nio bottom at 9:30
Thanks bought in
I hope so, I just lost a shit ton of money on one of my calls lmao. Sold a call I bought previously, used some of the profit to buy another one with a $58 call and now I'm down $350. I'm new to this though, gotta learn somehow
This market is just one fake out over the next. Designed to take money from retail and put it in the pockets of the pros
Fastly is so annoying. By all accounts, it should be 20%+ today. Useless turd surges randomly.
Who even is Citron, sounds like a dude who wants a good entry
Schwab moon
If you can‚Äôt hold this sell off, you‚Äôre in the wrong game.
So like, a gamma squeeze is sorta just the tip of it? I've seen people throw around GEX. But for that you also need to know if specific open interest is getting hedged long or short, right?
Have you heard about TSLA? Great company
You spelled it wrong
üé∂ They‚Äôre gonna make me declare bankruptcy and I said NIO NIO NIO üé∂
Have you ever looked at a chart of a stonk?
Bought up way otm vxx calls for 10/20

This months been so crazy that no one even talks about tesla being down 10 percent in thirty days.
NIO 20% move today. Very cool, very legal.
I think we will at least hit 50 again. I'll sell at 57, whether that's today or May 2024.
If they‚Äôre shares just keep holding! I use T dividends to feed my gambling addiction lmao

> But there a should of young people dying too. I know more young people that died from COVID than from any other cause in the last few years. 

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex

That simply isn't true. So far age 25-34, 1,725 deaths from Covid, in a country of how many million? Compare that to this and you will see in fact that for younger people, under 44, the flu is in fact worse than COVID. 

https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/animated-leading-causes.html

As to counter your second point, that only applies if you have the genes and habits to make it to 80 in the first place.
imagine losing money on NIO when you could buy STOR instead

If NIO is up 5% AH you know this shit is being played
It's proper value is 19$. It's still got way more room before it's as overvalued as Tesla
I miss snowboarding
In TDAmeritrade, I click on Fundamentals and it shows it there. Not sure about other platforms. Maybe Yahoo Finance but they don't always have up to date info about that stuff.
I got downvoted for saying nio was already priced in for earnings.  üòÜ  thats what they get for getting greedy asf.

Spy going up on low volume. End of day dump?
Don‚Äôt have enough collateral
Same lol
SPCE is a weird one for me man. I never could time it properly.
Fuck it holding NIO 54/57 calls exp next friday
FDs work on a hourly time frame, big dick.
Update on Trade looks like Traders will lock in close to 50% of the Premium taken in on the trade. There is some upside Risk on the SPY 355 Call Strikes and there is a need to cover the DIA 291 Call Strike at a loss of 350 dollars right now. Just to close this out unless there is a massive sell-off to close the day below 1% on the indices the take-home is going to be around 500 bucks - Good luck if you took on the trade and congrats on the profit - Annualize it and the returns are massive :)
CRSR should pump
this aged well

Don't worry about boomers, definite end to lockdown sometime next year is positive for lots of beaten down shit including energy
What makes you think it will go to 60? I'm debating selling
Yeah they are worth .01 now
Shit happens bro, you can't always win.  If stuff like this makes u sad and want to cry, maybe you shouldn't invest at all..... Sounds like your life will be less stressful
What a shit day
Xi likes his pigs fatten up before slaughtering them
When you have PDT rule and can‚Äôt sell NIO until Monday fuck my life
Just like always, when you see the daily thread clogged with a ticker and people posting memes in their own threads, that's WSB calling the top and it is time to get out.
Bought more Nio leaps
RKT, FSR is free $
Sold NIO.  Double downed on BABA.  Still have faith in the Chinese!
Until Becky gets that pumpkin spice
Lockdown imminent
Please cut it loose my man.
So fam, this (Nio) is why you use trailing-stops (or hell, just a stop) and don't go full-retard with blind devotion to any company that doesn't know (or care) that you exist.  If you're *<insert meme stock here>-gang*, you're also bag-holding when it drops instead of moving on to the next thing.
You know, this would actually be a cool move
I saw, definitely avoiding now.
Yeah I was about to but I think it‚Äôs run up too much for a Spac not about to merge
Yea, I've seen this before. I'll prob wait till eod and pick up a monthly or something. Thankss
this did not age well

Check out the TTM Squeeze indicator. I don't really use it to trade but just something I look at when I see price consolidating in a tight range for a while. In this case, it was showing a squeeze on the 5 min. The bigger the time frame the squeeze is on, the bigger the potential move once a breakout occurs.
I‚Äôm carrying these NIO puts into the weekend, figure the bulls got rewarded for being greedy assholes this morning, why shouldn‚Äôt we on Monday? üêª
Have to be crazy to hold nio for the gap down to $30

Pltr holding my portfolio up while nio... good work sir
why is TDOC getting drilled today? Did COVID disappear?
Jesus fucking Christ NIO what the fucking fuck
Nio call holders were jacking off during pre-market. Look at them now. Don't get greedy retards.
It‚Äôs amazing how NIO IV is still going up today. Holding $45 Jan2022 calls, gonna sell some more covered calls, like a $55 11/20 before market close today, that‚Äôs gonna cover another 10% of my long cost right there
Not with that mentality
Can someone eli5 plz
Ive been watching it, looks like it wants to retest the 100 dollar level.

If it fails there there is this upward trendline but it depends on how much time to get there. If you go to trading view just draw an upward trendline that touches its previous lows. that's where it bounced off of the other day.
That‚Äôs a negative, Ghostrider.
Did BABA find its bottom possibly?
Guys get Lowe‚Äôs calls for earnings next week. It‚Äôs a slam dunk
Citron fucked me before with an INO evaluation. Sold my NIO calls the instant i saw the report. From here on just auto-buy puts anything they talk shit on.

Lost 50% portfolio on NIO calls today

At least I sold my 20 shares in my IRA at 48 haha

There was a language barrier. By buy shares, they meant sell all their shares
I recommend buying SRACW.

Economists are like weatherman
I‚Äôm afraid so.
You sir know how to party
COMM about to gl parabolic. Last chance.
Still hasn‚Äôt dropped past 43 as of right now. It‚Äôs lost the hype but will still reach mid forties at least during run up to earnings. After earnings it might be fucked idk
Yes they beat earnings Hit 80 a few minutes in and then dropped to like 60 and then again to 50s.  Money is rotating out of furniture online stores. Yes they have more, but they don't care. I traded OSTK from under 10 - > 110 this year along with options. I don't see it going back up beyond 60s until next earnings.
That isn't going to happen. It will be a slow crawl back so don't go in thinking it's going to rocket back to 300 in a few days.

That said if you have the cash it's pretty much a locked ~20% return over a few months - that is still hard to pass up.
That he concedes

Already down. Nothing insane happening there I‚Äôm talking an actual bubble like GME and nio. Something with a crazy run that ends up killing over a quarter of this sub.

Jesus these COVID tech stocks are getting flushed hard
Buy NIO at higher price
Citron: NIO is having an earnings report soon, we could evaluate the current state of the business based on Q3 results... or we could downgrade 3 days before

Honestly fuck this. Doesn‚Äôt even make sense to put a downgrade before earnings. You‚Äôll literally have more info in 3 days lmfao. They don‚Äôt wanna see us win boys. Still üíéüëãüèª btw. +45% from +270%

Yeah, you know what, maybe I'll regret it, but I'm dropping everything out of NIO except for 2 11/20 60c's at 1.24. 

I can afford to loose that.

Seriously NIO? After 4.5 hours of getting to choke my gorgeous portfolio with your cock, two little poots of green is all you could manage? Pathetic. I registered an account just so I could leave this comment in hopes NIO sees it one day. Fronting like you're some alpha male, while I'm performing my heart out, and what do you give me? Two tiddlywinks of 51c? I've never felt so personally offended by before. You're a real asshole, pal.
and yes, only on desktop- I can't see it on my phone and 0dte on my mobile are unavailable. However on desktop I may buy them but it gives me the sweep warning and let's me know it will count as a day trade.
Who was the chump that bought my NIO calls?ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
For mos tit, it is hard
Sell nio and buy Baba. So undervalued
you can‚Äôt sell if your account wasnt >25k the previous trading day.
Take the L, lock in the gains, stay on RH for everything other than day trades. And move to another broke or high risk day trades
They are positioning themselves to own the infrastructure for quick battery swapping stations across Asia. They current have 155 operational.
Lol happened the next day
Held at support, likely on the way up until close.

I'm betting on it gapping up on Monday but it's still a risk - things are still dicey.

Being bullish on a company does not mean being retarded. Cut your losses man.
NIO in absolute shambles
Only up 700% on nio now:/ 1100% this morning was nice I guess
Whose jealous of my nio puts? I know the retards who sold these to me are in here
Waiting for the SEC  to come knocking on my door. Sold Nio Calls yesterday and immediately moved to puts on whim.
I just picked up some long 45c for december
SE is going to be a monster over the long term and everyone knows it

Whats your 6 month projection?
NIO has support at $40. If it loses that....
Does zm dip again once moderna announces vaccine?
Amen. Document the emails too. In case you get fired for reporting the incident.
It's not meant as an insult. The training's also just very different
Everyone likes EVs and SOLO isn‚Äôt even Chinese.
I had enough sense to sell my position when it was at 54 lmao
what are good reopening stocks we should play that will spike when moderna announces vaccine?
Baba to 300 eom
baba executed fifty babies
[removed]
Nio going to 42 descending triangle and broke 44
Hmm, are these "good" announcements typically done that late in a friday?

May just buy super cheap OTM puts and calls EOD
This.
Meats back on the menu boys!
Dumnuts
Is Nio dead? I‚Äôm still up should I pull out now?
SPXS 4p 11/20 are the way to hedge bears
NIO look out below
NIO fucked me so hard
goddamn....witnessed
Yeah fuck NIO.
Well let‚Äôs just say I make $25k look like a partial tax bracket.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
anyone else rotating out of the meme EV & into BABA?
I am actually interested just because of the report lol it wasn‚Äôt one of Andrews best reports and after pton shop and shit I told myself I would inverse himüòÇüòÇ
I am going to strangle tf out of SPY eod

*slow clap* that's good
Hope nio bulls sold & if not, you were a pig. Too bad I don‚Äôt like buying puts cause I‚Äôm pussy
I‚Äôd rather lose my entire portfolio on Chinese government EV stocks than have to watch Apple‚Äôs limp dick movement for the past 2+ months. They don‚Äôt deserve the 2T badge.

So you think NIO should be valued at more than $1M per car? ü§°
‚ÄúI‚Äôm still alive but I‚Äôm barely breathing‚Äù

-NIO
Times like this is when I‚Äôm glad I did half and half
5$ take it or leave it.
Sold 415/430 spreads on zm... Probably a mistake.
I doesn't have to be strictly bad news. But if the first vaccines aren't being distributed until late December or they don't expect everyone to be vaccinated until May/June then that's definitely worse than what the market is pricing in.
Baba calls was the right call
Lol I was gonna buy nio right now but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs smart.
I swear WSB members make comments like this as a joke when this is the SMART thing to do. 

When the fuvk do you buy? When it‚Äôs shrek green and premiums are through the roof?
Nobody needs data platforms when covid is over they need cruise lines /s

I am entering 11/27 ZM 500C. Witness me

Why was this deleted?
Nah bro buy the dip üòÇ
This PDD call is up 300% but out of day trades
Like if you know what the fuck you're doing. Dislike if you don't
LMAO right here son. Small time autist, so I only made 500$, by that effectively doubled my RH portfolio.
I was worried about riding covid cases, NY governor talking new lockdowns and a Biden aid talking local lockdowns on a national level. Didn't want to be greedy.
Dont worry $60 call 11/20 baby ride it out to the moon
What was the news on baba?
They also took years to be valued so high. They were producing mainstream vehicles and proprietary technology for sale for 8 years before they were valued higher than any major automaker, and around for close to 20. So if you want to compare them to Tesla, compare them to 2014 Tesla, which had a $15-30 billion market cap. Nio is currently sitting near $60 billion, 2-4x what Tesla was at similar maturity. Seems overvalued even compared to Tesla, which was called overvalued at that price.
The line for the last 2 and a half hours looks pretty flat to me champ.
This did not age well. Shits tanking faster than the titanic
People who thought NIO was gonna keep going up are idiots. People who think it‚Äôs gonna crash back to 20$ are also idiots.
wow.... finally was able to close my NIO spreads on RH.... was 9 ITM at the highest and RH couldnt fill shit, even leaning heavy to the bid side. all it took was for it to go -1 OTM and then i got my money back....

fucking lame as fuk.
heavier than my fat bitch of an ex wife atleast
Exp?
wish I could make a bet with you on this and take all of your money.
NIO $25. Final offer.
My usual mistakes tend to be on FDs with large positions. Decided to take my profits from that giant run up on Monday and go into something long term.

&#x200B;

I do really like PLTR so best of luck on your FDs!
lol, well the common wisdom is that it's all just random and you can't have an edge. If you can't get over that sentiment any success looks like luck and TA is tarot. But once you accept it's manipulated and driven by machines, well ... Still looks like it's from a bad movie at first glance
Rapid antigen and notoriously shit and have a sensitivity of 50-60%
Monday is a bit premature. They only just hit the threshold of infections on Wednesday. Wouldn‚Äôt expect anything valuable from them until maybe 25th
What the fuck i invested solo without a single google because of you retards. Thats not a fucking car. God dam. Never again swear to god
Babba finally catching a bid
There she goes...
+30%
Everything they said is perfectly rational and isn't new information.  People here knew all of that stuff and were just choosing to ignore it and ride the wave up.
my spy puts got absolutely rapunzled today
This is the way.
SNOW getting pretty low. I know it‚Äôs overvalued AF but make get a bounce soon if the market remains strong
Most retarded shit I‚Äôve seen. Why would you buy high and sell low
Just invested in NETE
oh god. i want my mommy!
This but unironically
Sucks for me that China Tech is so closely tied to QQQ. Hopefully the earnings next week can prove that they are faster growing and more lucrative 

$165 12/18 BIDU
HBI calls 1 month out pretty cheap
We might see 29,600 on the Dow today. Then, 30K+ on Monday.
Jack ma you should go and kiss xi ring or what the fuck they do out there lol
You had plenty of times to cash out after the citron report. But no. Couldve been 240k to 220k probably
NIO noooooo
Do y'all think NIO Is going to hit 46 by next week? I'm feeling like I should just sell my calls now and take the loss.
Might be one of the best decisions of your life mate

If you can tell me how to post proof without doxing myself I'm happy to take a screenshot of it. It's listed as "Same day expiration" under Options Trading in the settings page. I shit you not.

Just hold it
I'm holding. I think it has room to grow especially with these other EVs taking off
Seriously?  Report him to HR for sure
Fuck he's talking today? Now I'm actually scared for the gains I made today
only matters if they used a hard r
https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/06/2121941/0/en/AYRO-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html
What percentage gain/loss are y'all all time?
It was a correction. The Citron valuation is garbage. Trying to short right before ER ü§°

NIO still has room to grow. The other EVs beat their ER and are catching up to NIO in share price but anybody with a brain can see NIO is ahead of the pack. It may correct to a more reasonable price after NIO Day (under $100) but $54 isn't going to be the ATH come January.
yea surely wsb would know
zoom out for me champ

Just pocketed $9500 today after spending like less than $1500
Throw hands
Guess I sold those spy 356 calls to early
Nawww
Casual racism is not cool brah
I threw a little bit of money into calls last Friday and this Monday I should've took my 700 profit but instead let it drop all the way down. If I just sold in the morning and switched to puts for the day I could've made so much fuckin money
I like dragging my little pointer to 10am today and imagine how happy I would‚Äôve been if I was awake
i was jokin about citron comin thru yesterday but damn
lol sorry, thought only RH had that rule in the US
What if I shit on her dick?
Not nearly as heavy as the puts will be.
Lol these nio bulls got wiped the fuck out ignorant pricks
Took me down from 135k to 100k lil bitches
So your bet is that a $7 stock will go to $600? gg
Same
What about SOLO?
What r u shorting them or something?üòÇüòÇ
You can‚Äôt fucking hold anything for a day or two. The gains are given right back.

It was the same when TSLA was on the way up, the shorts garner too much analyst and media coverage.

You really think he‚Äôs going to give a vaccine update that vaccines aren‚Äôt working? üòÇ
don't say it
I feel like Tesla has had a million red days in a row. This feels eerily similar to after Q2 earnings when $TSLA was rangebound between 1420-1550 then boom surprise with the stock split. 

I think we‚Äôre in for a surprise that‚Äôs gonna rocket this straight to 470 very soon.
Holy shit, I hope this is shares man
Smart man. Had the same, sold mine yesterday at open. Should have rebought back in with those at open today, but I prefer the FDs now.
[deleted]
just sell and move to a different broker in the meantime
NIO and XPEV are just being thoughtful and allowing other people to buy in.
Flat
It's goin up if they do that's for sure
ya

Come on, Peloput, you're my portfolio's only hope. I wish I'd bought a NIO put. I got to start inversing these WSB meme stocks.

Ya that ain‚Äôt so bad, I see it around 300 sooner than later. Gonna think this one over
Be greedy when others are fearful
Aw man, do I dare try an actual SPY FD for Monday? Never done one because I thibknits stupid but I saw people spending only $70 for one at EOD last Friday and getting pretty large returns. Honestly, for $70, thats worth risking. Notnsure if puts or calls tho. I'll be watching today too, but it won't matter as much as what happens over the weekend
That would be a 25% drop and a 4 month low after they beat earnings. More likely scenario they hit 60$ish and trade sideways for awhile
no
What about Monday when we were reopening lol
Dude, just a single cursory glance at what you've typed - it's not much to ask. Takes like 10 seconds.
This is what's giving me diamond hands as well. 44 was a resistance a few days ago, and has become a support. If it stays above that then I expect NIO to head back up on Monday and Tuesday.
No no no. Buy more. Nio to 80
It doesn't ive tried
Citron's chance to cuck  the market and jump in before ER.

Hold steady, m' lad.
Just like that China fucked us ü§¨
What are the thoughts on SOLO? I got 7.5c 11/20 feeling like I should wait it out till monday
Well you could try learning how to take a screenshot on your pc first...
I'm holding. Long term. I think this is a step below market manipulation. But I get why people are nervous. I just don't have feelings anymore so I can't get upset
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it opens 38-39 range then bounces tho drilling further seems just as likely
20c 5/21
I feel real stupid earning $9500. NIO was a dumb move.

Its probably already priced in
Dude I might but i might get burned lol
I feel like I want to hold BA over the weekend but ill be punished if I do
260c for 12/24 picked up today and a few 260c for 11/20 just for fun
If it had any reason to go down to $5 I'm not sure if it will be able to get back up lol not that its impossible but people would be burned so hard they would not return
Yeah
1/15 15c +40% so far. Excited for triple digits
damn so SPY aint goin down today then eh

Let us bask in tendies

From 240k to 175k in the span of a few hours all thanks to Citron.
U I missed you so much.  I am exhausted from chasing you.
I feel ya, it going wrong would be worse than going right
I'm still not selling my 68c 12/4 NIO Call. Kiss my ass bears and this sell-off. It'll reverse come next week.
being flagged a PDT is such horse shit. watch your shit go up 100% and u can‚Äôt even sell it. my portfolio went to 38k but i cant fucking take gains. fucking crutch for ppl trading <25k
guys, who has been making millions on ev puts? like did anyone cop Li, xpev and solo puts before the great reckoning? maybe even nio?
D
[deleted]
Idk man the 60K I have made so far seems to be doing me right
Bought a few yesterday and more today. I assumed it would drop hard and fast with all the covid news. But you‚Äôre right, I should add a longer term option as well.
If it doesn't, earnings itself should. It's basically a guaranteed beat if Li and XPEV did it
My momma always told me I get extra chickie tendies and need to wear my helmet cause of how big my brain beez.

Is it for sure supposed to be in relation to Warp Speed? Could it just be a different announcement?

Yeah probably, I loaded up on BABA 270c 2/19 a bit safer than the others as it's after Feb earnings.

Balls deep for their annoucement
I usually play credit spreads on AMZN because it‚Äôs expensive and it can move wildly up and down within a range, which is bad for straight calls/puts. When I saw AMZN at $2900 I grabbed a bunch of put credit spreads, easy money. These I got a little greedy on, but I‚Äôm currently still up, so I guess we‚Äôll see what next week holds.

I wouldn‚Äôt take advice from me though, I‚Äôm working my way back after going $5k in the hole.
I know and shop under a 100 in a year lolll he is not considered as manipulating because he disclose his position lol that‚Äôs a dumb rule üòÇ

Maybe concede the election? It's pretty obvious he's officially lost, even to him. He wouldn't do that during market hours because it would hurt his pride to see the market pump on his news, I'd bet
I bet ü•≠ will never concede. He was shit talking about Hilldogs popular vote lead due to illegal votes until late 2018. So load up your calls/puts he is going to hype how he is winning bigly everywhere. Also ü•≠s been firing ppl non loyalists.

But there a should of young people dying too. I know more young people that died from COVID than from any other cause in the last few years.

Meanwhile PRPL is at 28
Does he even care about the stock market at this point? Theres a 99% chance hes not getting relected.
Because you're too fucking stupid to understand the purpose of rapid antigen tests and their use case. 

These tests are used to identify people that need further testing in cases were time matters. Think the NFL, they probably use a rapid test on everyone first thing in the morning. If anyone knocks positive they isolate and are given the very accurate standard PCR test.

I would ask you if you feel fucking stupid right now but there is no way you understood what I just typed.

It‚Äôs funny how we don‚Äôt see any Citron reports about LI or XPEV, which have already reported, as opposed to NIO, which reports on Tuesday....

üëå
Its like walking into a psychiatric ward and seeing some guy wrapped in cloth giggling/laughing to himself
yea i saw that one looks nice to me should i buy in, i think it could go up alot
Google their cars. Then you‚Äôll buy puts
And also the least rewarding
Buy Hertz
How?
ishmael beah
Yuppppp
Only if you're left out.

Like me.
Made 800% on some 1 DTE Nio calls i bought yesterday and sold this morning üî•üî•üî•
NIO lol hahahahaha bet a lot of you feel pretty stupid rn investing in this Chinese knockoff crap
Imagine buying nio rtteardedw Canada solo cars are my new Elon
Jack Ma says ‚Äúback to making tendies‚Äù
About what? Market's up.

... oh, you must be one of them NIO tards.
I am sure some motherfucker rode it good and made a bank.
RISE BABA YOU STUPID MOTHA FUCKA RISE
noice
MRNA calls?
damn same
You're retarded if you aren't buying SOLO
go look again
Don‚Äôt
Couldn't possibly go lower than its ATH prior to yesterday that just sold off, right?  


Unless you bought shares to hold long, in which case, probably good
Thanks for this post gonna prob add large position here always pays to be early
Yep
[deleted]
very nice, and theyve got more room to run, ual to 45 new week tuesday
Bought 730 shares today.
It‚Äôs a chance to buy a call for Monday??
44 got that r-word strength. And no, I don't mean redskin.
[deleted]
You don't want proof. I'm just an old lady with sad, old.... proof.
To me your best predictor of realistic price is what the price of the stock was about this time last year. If you are seeing major gains more than 6%, you are in danger once the ship turns around. My opinion only. I‚Äôm no finance nerd.
PLTR going flat, I got 11/20 20$ FDs for a moon, not this gay shit.
Jack Ma says ‚ÄúXi you are number 1‚Äù
NIO might be stupid, but there is no way in hell I am considering an EV startup whose YouTube promo videos are made in iMovie.
Type F to pay respects for NIO
Well duh, obviously yes. But then, when would you have gotten back in?
Just buy NIO puts now. They are going to shit themselves thru earnings
Must be this fucking Navarro guy
3/19
There is no way pfizer will use TFFP to reformulate the vaccine. TFFP has solid business model but your speculation lacks evidence. Looks like a carefully worded pump and dump.
Lol maybe cause this valuation was ridiculous enough for them ?üòÇ
Yep lol
Yea Citron: Sonos to $30 JMIA is fraud, no wait JMIA is worth $100/share it sounds like one of those blogs that got acquired and the new owners increase the ad load by 1000% based on the previous owner reputation. Eventually people will stop listening.
Damn bro. You could‚Äôve bought an entire mouth of new teeth at that return!
[deleted]
calls?
I guess 356.50 is the bottom now
Why not sell calls against your existing calls?
RKT
Godspeed my fellow turds
That's what I'm saying. This is the time to buy the dip lmao
Yeah lol
Baba weeklys are not the move but anything a month or two out that can be built upon is probably a great play.
BABA shares, cnk 12.5p and ccl 15p 11/20 let's gooooooo
Because everyone else is buying it.
So JPM bought $100 million worth of RKT shares yesterday and its red today? Wtf
Never a risk
Wasent this first twst with a person on bored ? Cant afford to make it crash
[deleted]
FSRRRRRRRR
$RIP NIO?
4 dolla
I bought Li Auto. Hopefully works lol
I wish I could! Went balls deep yesterday but still think I got it at a discount. Strict lockdowns make zoom go vroom
Genius. How did you know
shares? idk mannnnn
American made EV hype baby! Ride the wave. If bullshit like NKLA can hit $90 with fraud and fake products, no reason this one can‚Äôt do the same with a better business model. Actual legit CEO and product designs/timeline. I‚Äôm in for a flyer with a few May 20c
Goldman did this when they were touching $13. PT‚Äôd them at $8 and then they loaded up. Wouldn‚Äôt doubt Citron is doing the same
just bought a bunch of spy puts
Who‚Äôs buying into the NIO dip? How‚Äôs it looking EOD?
You didn't even mention the ticker but it's NIO isn't?  God WSB sucks so fucking much right now
I just came for the memes
No way im holding calls over the weekend with all the rona record deaths all over the world popping up today. Im ready for Friday sour hour.
Word, I needed that.
No idea. Made nice tendies tho
At least buy lube.
11/27 NIO 24put let's go
trump is going to announce something at 4. Something is up
SPY under 356.50 would not be a good look
lmaooooo so fax
Who the fuk is he?! No srsly I don‚Äôt know who he is
Naw bro. COVID is a joke. The new flu. Get use to it. Got my plane tickets to Miami yesterday. Bitch.
Anything really
Yo wtf
[deleted]
Trump not giving his Warp Speed update until after close. If he wanted a pump he would have given the update during market hours like he usually does. Just saying.
It's confirmed. OP is a little girl
Rip
Haha was that some kind of test? Cheers, seems like a shitton of information gathered.
Today apparently is a reopening play loll
All these EV pump and dumps are so fucking dumb
nio?
Like they did not let Apple, MCD, Starbucks etc win?
Way too low
Seriously?
Not going balls deep, but some and seeing what Monday brings.
No one cares about a grade 12 report that looks like it was done at 11:59pm. Shorts just taking advantage of it, but eventually, they‚Äôll be squeezed. Didn‚Äôt the shorts lose like couple billion shorting NIO? When will they learn..
how did it go? you bought at the high right before it plummeted 10pct?
So where is all the nio talk bahaha!
never short a dull market
What if everyone in China is forced to buy one NIO share...
Anyone know wtf is going on. Do we panic now?
I had a 10 bagger when BA mooned and June. It's going to do it again next week. I can feel it in my loins!
theyve been ripping for days baby what is u doin
Market is jittery as fuck right now. If you're going super long, then there's occasionally good buys to be had out there. I'm just started buying my first shares of BABA yesterday and I think I'll go for a bit more. 

I don't think you should go all in for Chinese stocks, but a decent portion of your portfolio in Chinese stocks is likely not a bad idea if you have the appetite for risk.
Pretty good
I am extremely stressed and depressed. Bought NIO at 52 after selling my previous NIO position. All my gains gone. Thankfully they are Dec 18 calls but still... So depressed.
Are you retarded?
Sir this is a casino
[deleted]
Anyone holding NLS calls?
They are probably going to get hit next by one of the short groups lol
Mmm should‚Äôve included some put in there
Cruise puts now
They would be pointless. Would be like making news about the regular waves when there is tsunami going around. Covid killed more in America than any war since WWII, and that's relevant news. People recovering from diseases is normal.
Last chance to get baba calls this cheap. Or at least I fucking hope so for the 5k worth I‚Äôm sitting on
I had 60c 11/27 this morning that I bought for 1.63 a few days ago. Should've sold at $5 but ended up selling at $2.95.
When does the market open today
[removed]
I‚Äôm in, Jan 355$ C.
zm 400 support is strong
Ya... I woke up and was rocking and rolling.

I checked on my lunch break and was like WTF
And that he gave Phizer that big beautiful contract
Nvda just go to 520. It‚Äôs a nice number. You can trigger more algos there too
I was at the dentist
I‚Äôm not unrealistic about that, just saying I think the market as a whole should realize this guy is a piece of shit who tanks momentum stocks to benefit his own short positions and not to take any downgrades from him seriously.
I bought some shares
id put my life savings in 2023 leaps and sleep for a year, wake up a millionaire
it's BS. i checked desktop. there is absolutely no setting at all.

he's blowing smoke up our asses since everyone would be celebrating if they allowed it

Nope. All true.

Nope. Update on Operation Warp Speed.
Just bought NIO @ 44.77 :)

are we going to ignore theta's facts tho?
Dude that's Plato
SPY put gang..
We either diamond hands or we only got dimes in our hands next week!
LOL you really think this recall will move share price?

I can tell you font know much about gm
Commence the sell off!!
This is a correction. If it holds 44 it‚Äôs fine.
SPCE test launch next week. Unusual whales spots a 31c 12/18. Its time to sail among the stars
Happy that I jumped off and took a big loss at 108
Please tell me im not the only one who bought at the top? Down 5.7k so far ü§°
nice call! you really know your stuff!
guys i haven‚Äôt had an erection in over 4 hrs, should i call my doctor?
Trump talking today?
Who the heck is Citron and why do they matter?
Pigs will fly when that happens.
soooooo, baba?
That‚Äôs the answer I needed. I‚Äôll drop 10k in shares on a dip. I love you

why the gap up on spx at open? what is the upside play everyone sees that i dont
GME Holders: Please make a new announcement/PR to send us to tendie heaven!

Dude thought pton would be 5$ in january, pretty stupid how he can get away with his manipulation
Good morning to you. Yes we‚Äôve been through hell and back
Its at a price it was 2 days ago .
Everyone realized Nikola pumping with EVs was a mistake since they‚Äôre not a real company, right? That‚Äôs why todays hype died faster than every other EV? I think I‚Äôm FINALLY ready to buy some puts on this company.
[deleted]
Honestly can't tell due to wide bid/ask. Ibkr says the positions are up and down across the tons I have, but if I try to buy the positions that are down, it gives me a mid point that is definitely up.

I usually don't look since these were all 6 months out.

It looks like 25% maybe but I never try to figure things out this early into a trade.
[deleted]
2020 man, can't underestimate anything...
Nice comeback SE
i hope nio goes down to 5 dollars
Yep. Edited lol
Finally decided to dip into PLUG calls.

This is going wonderful
SPY is stuck in 27m volume. Boomers want to wait till ü•≠ speaks today.
The vehicles do, infact, look retarded. DD checks out.
Trump is supposed to talk about vaccines and virus developments but he'll spend 80% of the time talking about the election and 15% of the time talking about how he banned China flights first back in February and got called a racist for that.
Short report:  TESLA WILL UNDERCUT NIO PRICING 

China: ‚ÄúDo you really think we will let Elon win against a Chinese company?‚Äù

110% retardation

Good ole shares
oh shit, he's going to try do his job like he's in that last two weeks of school euphoria.
About to go hard into NIO.
For everyone asking why ZM is going down. The market is forward thinking and zoom is CRAZY overvalued compared to other tech stocks. YES everyone knows a second wave is coming. But the market is forward thinking, and a vaccine in the very near future is all but certain now.  Once that happens, will zoom still be in a better position than before corona? Most likely, but nowhere near this current valuation
How‚Äôs TSLA still going down when papa elon doesn‚Äôt even believe he has covid bc of how little it‚Äôs affecting him?
Sold all my airline stocks today. Made +80% on ALK and +60% on DAL :)
Picked up UVXY calls in case of something wild over the weekend

Hey MMs i bet you cant get sq to 185 today. You dont have that power, you wont
Did that lol then bought a put on NIO that I‚Äôm like +40% on and want to offload EOD
Literally my whole portfolio is red wtf is good with all this green is see
Sell some puts and make some money
Agree.

This thing is being manipulated by the Illuminati at this point..n
Donnie needs to just give up and enjoy like the last months golfing or some shit while we can enjoy the Biden pumps
Got my shares down to 10 each on NIO, XPEV, LI.

Made my gains, buy the plunge and wait for next week.
Fuck PTON why are you going down? Anyone know?
It won‚Äôt be much longer before this crashes and burns everyone don‚Äôt worry
I‚Äôm still holding 10C, 11c and 12c Jan/21, up 2,000%
My retarded NIO put bought last week just went from -99% to break even lmao
It's the way
[deleted]
Yep.
Alright, NIO bears. If NIO was trying to pump their stock and then pull the rug why wouldn't they wait until January when they have NIO Day and they can get all of these autists to keep buying until it hits triple digits?
lol you can see that the bio of insane quant is well deserved.
Obviously, I know that go somewhere.
What we buyin boys ???
Where are you now
What PLTR LEAP you got?
Dude really
50 minutes ago is old>
Rugpull
Citron should stick to fruit and leave EVs to the car manufacturers.
SOL?
But if it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôll shoot up
I think you mean 11/13/20
Why?
HE SAID HE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW
Because there is zero justification for it being worth this much. It‚Äôs all meme buying and people FOMOing into it

I am beginning to think securities markets are manipulated!
Y‚Äôall buying back NIO rn?
Is it just me or the Andrew left report is kind of bullish? He was a peloton and Shopify bear too and moon how that turned out lol I was actually not bullish on nio but I told myself I would inverse the next time he release a report üòÇ anyone with a similar opinion?üòÇ
Please nobody scares BABA
$300
No he used a rapid antigen test known to be inaccurate to create a false narrative. They are used to identify people that need a real test in places like the NFL were you are tested daily.  The standard PCR test are very accurate.
As long as you don‚Äôt have FDs expiring today, we‚Äôll be fine
Aint that the truth :/
so.... is tech dead ?
I got out this morning

Nice wedge on NIO buyin puts for monday

U checks out: but in a good way.
yes, it's the 'ancer'
Is NIO still the move?

Citron said this valuation can never be justified

so if you are buying calls after a massive run then best of luck
Maybe if I stare at the live nio chart it‚Äôll go up

Trump getting ready to concede?
Part of me says take the 100% profit. The other says fuck this bitch it‚Äôll tank for earnings. I can‚Äôt decide

Wow. I refuse to believe this is real. This is just... wow... a new level of retardation
Zoom out
Ford, GM, Mush, etc. have been complaining about NIO, XPEG, etc. and they finally got this SOB to write the article that cost people a bunch of money. At this point I don‚Äôt read or trade by any individual analyst. It‚Äôs a recipe for failure. Under pressure they‚Äôre all corrupt. The same group switched positions on JMIA. 

For this NIO call a bunch of people probably made a shit load of money on the back of Robinhooders by shorting. Wall Street is corrupt, they don‚Äôt want the individual traders disrupting their system and eating a piece of the pie. They‚Äôre also desperate to return to pre-COVID. Look at today‚Äôs trades and the market shift on the Pfizer news. They‚Äôre pathetic.
This is the CCP, don‚Äôt you dare question the efficacy of the tests.
Fuck it ZM, go to 350
Hey boo boo. Ya boy made a cool $3k in two hours off puts. Watch NIO dump, but shhhh don‚Äôt tell anyone ;)
Nah
Looking like NIO isn‚Äôt gonna moon again until next week

Shame
Looooool
With the short squeeze, they might have like 40% day Tuesday/Wednesday
Everyone go google the words "island top reversal"
Is that illegal? If not I‚Äôm down to collaborate with someone to make it.

Wtf does QFIN do?
NIO big green PP?
Yup, she‚Äôs a goner. Was fun while it lasted. Take your tendies and find a new one bois!
So wtf is this? Another "rotation" because of the next vaccine being priced in?
You bought shares at the top???

I decided to hold.  I'll probably regret it next week but oh well.  I just have a couple of options so it is a small bet.
[deleted]
You‚Äôre fucked. It‚Äôs only worth 24.99
People need to chill out the stock had a massive up rising it has monster potential and is going to explode on earnings
What exactly did you bet on to get such horrendous results?
So... EV back to the moon?
[removed]
Depends on if we get the vaccine news by Monday I guess. If we don't I'm just gonna cash in again and wait for the news, then back to shorting travel/hospitality/cruise ships
Congratulations and fuck you

If it is rising because I said Jack Ma said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù then this is the dumbest market in the history of ever.
Yeah it needed a pullback but citron couldve waited until after earnings before fucking everyone

Hey now they where one of the first big names in EV, the Fisker Karma was an unprecedented price of shit tho lmaoo

I bought 10000 shares at 44. Am I doing good? Time to sell covered calls now.
KCAC is voting on Nov 25th on whether to merge with QuantumScape (Bill Gates backed EV battery supplier).
Citron and profit taking. Plus it did the same thing last week.

But dip today or at open monday for the run back to 50

Docu a strong play rn??
This is old news.
Get fucked ü•≠
I‚Äôll sell some CSP‚Äôs and it‚Äôll break through!

NYC schools might all go remote Monday. Seeing a lot of potential lockdown news all over the country. Moves?

The vaccine news really broadened the scope of relevant stocks and i am not a fan....
BABA before it's too late
Market seems to be broadly ignoring it so far..
[deleted]
WTF is BABA doing below 260?? Fake and üåà
People don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs already red so they‚Äôll continue to sell until another MM bumps up on Monday and it‚Äôs trending up then people will buy. 

Literally peanuts compared to what these crooks like Citron probably made.
ü•≠ delivering warp speed update is bullish bcoz he is the ultimate hype lord. But having him lost the election makes it a confusing scenario. Also he is going to talk at 4 pm should have scheduled at 3pm for some action.
So... you retiring next Tuesday?
And you didn‚Äôt sell at $54?!?
How do we feel about 11/27 UVXY $14C's?
Why are you guys still here? Don't you know we only trade from 9:30-11:00 and 3:30 to 4:00?
No, up or stay the same, preferably up. Credit spreads rely on theta decay and IV crush, debit spreads are like discount options with capped gains.
how did you lose 240k on a stock that has been a huge green dildo pumped up by this entire sub for the past 10 days?! Holy shit man... why didn't you cut bait at like... 100k loss?
You all got anymore of that tech crash. My puts sure could use a bit of life before expiry.

I‚Äôm in with 30 shares. Viability will depend a lot on how their upcoming test flight goes. Hub and spoke service for small sats has some interesting applications, and doesn‚Äôt fall into the trap of trying to compete with all the small rocket launch companies. The industry is already heavily invested in small sats and rideshare, they could have a big market if they can follow through.
Ez
Can NIO crash some more? $44 looking too hard to break for today :(
exp date?
Mmm don‚Äôt stay for the event it‚Äôll crash always does
I started at $4 and only have 860, it should be well over 2,000. Should have bought more
I‚Äôm not a musk worshipper but taking science tips from Jim Cramer?

Yeah I‚Äôll pass
Once all these Trump lawsuits are thrown out or done and over with, and once Biden starts being the face is the US, these EV companies will pick up again.

Even as a PTON call holder, can't say I didn't see this coming.
Si senor
I hope so, but is it? why do you think that ?
I would say it‚Äôs a pointer finger pointing up so buy or it‚Äôs a ring finger so you know it‚Äôs so good you‚Äôd marry it so also buy.  To the moon.

When to buy nvda dip for earnings run up? Now or EoD?
ZM and PTON down for same reason. 

BABA completely different. 

CCP and antitrust or COVID/Vaccine, which do you like odds on better?
You. It‚Äôll be you.
You‚Äôve become the very thing you‚Äôve sworn to destroy
Vaccine pumps, also Disney reported less of a loss, growth in streaming. They‚Äôre banking on vaccine and parks opening in the future, which means phat cash. Lot of the plays right now are on the future/potential. Though COVID numbers do scare big investors. Market runs on optimism until it doesn‚Äôt work
Yeaaa, if it breaks this support it‚Äôs going to tank to $25 which is exactly where the short seller said. I don‚Äôt think ya retards can prop it up any longer against the institutional investors. They just cleaned up from $54 to 44 and going to dump those profits on more puts
BABA squeezing right now

> \*PA SEC. OF STATE SAYS WILL NOT BE ORDERING RECOUNT OF ELECTION
No recount in PA !!!! Bullishhhh
It's truly at the price it was 24 hours ago
I bought NIO at 26
Rotation of Nasdaq into SPY.
Yes but I don't recall them having a week long 20% runup right before either. Although with NIO's ER coming up they will probably recover faster than otherwise.
so mms just wanted sq to stay at 178? hopefully they make it jump to 185 next week. i think im gonna hold my 11/20 10x185c
About damn time.
All I know about fisker is their decently cheeks car, what‚Äôs its future potential
[deleted]
I'm waiting till we break down out of the wedge to start building.  This thing could run back up to $50 before it starts to drop...
Lmao MRNA hitting 90 triggered the algos to dump

Almost ! Then we buy, again
No
Here we go üöÄ that was the bottom
PDD call I picked up today killing it
What's so good about Tesla?
It was too good to be true. But tbh I dont blame anyone who got burned, by looking at what happened with XPEV and LI. Citron did everyone dirty.
Can y‚Äôall stop removing posts it‚Äôs kinda shit to click something then it‚Äôs gone
I wish I could talk out of my ass with such confidence

Hmm, yes. What do?

BABA
For fucks sake BABA finally
Institutional money coming!! 

Hahahahahaha fucking idiots

You have to imagine the Dow is gonna drop any minute/day now. Impending lockdowns and it‚Äôs already nearing its all time high.
Guess it's time for dec NIO puts
That's great and I believe it but how do we use it to make the stock price go back up? Whether they're full of shit or not, the stock price is still dropping
Zoom go boom üò¢
what should I buy?
Damn! How do I stay on top of all this? Just try and follow news from companies whose stocks I got? Thanks for the link
FSR will dump next week.
Buying Walmart and Target for run up to ER next week. Out of yolos
Gtfo
Looking to get in nio leaps again early next week or maybe after earnings if it drops under 40
The people who bought NIO puts didn‚Äôt buy it at 54. 

They bought at maybe 46-48.
definitely sold WMT too early F
Schools are closing all over the country and we had another record day of cases. Why tf is Zoom drilling so hard
The word is *cachet*, Andrew.

Fuck NIO jump on fisker
For fuck's sake, has NIO bottomed out yet?

Ok I lost 1/2 my money on NIO calls, time to lose the rest on ZM calls. Godspeed retards
Yessir

Why?
So we can start saying I got MOON puts!  And MOON is cratering/shining...my portfolio is waxing/waning.  Will they be doing their research here at WSB I hope?

It's Amish life or Covid and there's no room for compromise.
Just bought 111 shares of ZM @ 398.60 per share. Fuck the retards who are selling this stock. COVID second wave will drive this back up
I have SPY puts but the market movement today makes worry about Monday. Airlines hotels cruises up, stay at home stonks down. Feels like another vaccine news might come out Monday.
Buy dip on Baba, ZM, or PTON?
Yes it is, the only reason it hasn't started a sharp uptrend is b/c investors are waiting for a successful test flight. After that happens (i think it's scheduled for next week or the week after?) it'll moon
Bruh
Riding this train with you brother.
Who here is long the SPY? Exactly. 

Who anywhere is long the SPY? Exactly.
Why the fuck does anyone care what stupid ass Citron says? Before their bitch ass made that dumb evaluation we were right on the road to 60
Woke up at opening, put the profits I took yesterday on EV back into EV after seeing positive movement after LI's earnings.

Went back to bed happy with record gains.

Woke up totally fucked.
Nah there‚Äôs really only a small handful of true degenerates and the rest of WSB just follows their plays like lemmings
Stocks are about the future. They are betting on vaccines. Stocks aren't about the near present.
I know your sick of NIO right now but Citron is ruining my life lol. How do we feel about a run up Monday and Tuesday still before earnings?
For sure
I'm fucked. SPY puts and tech calls
Honest opinion. Razor products USED to be good about 8+ years ago. Components that used to be solid crafted in metal or alum have been replaced with plastic, but the cheap kind.
Not a single item survives for more then 2 years when used in general gaming setting. Sure Razor scaled up production 1000 fold but made it from a luxury brand to a overpriced monstercable brand. Corsair scaled up over the same period but without losing durability.
FSR super undervalued for the $$$ they have on hand with 0 debt.
It looked just like the tesla move over 500 and i held through that... wasnt about to get raped again
Like a real wsb retard would do! I'm proud
China is already cracking down on Tech, and the US will follow suit soon.

Especially in a Commie place like China, you know they're not going to allow Tech to become more powerful than government.
NIO's going back up.  Just not today.
He used a niche specific use case rapid test that is known inaccurate. 

Standard PCR tests are VERY accurate.
This NIO train isn't working anymore it seems.
Reckon it will come back any time soon?

Great description of Citron is dog shit

‚ÄúThroughout the previous years Citron Research, a dedicated "research" company, founded by Andrew Left, a questionable short seller, who has been sued and convicted by regulators as well as governments, has been publishing deliberate yet legal falsehoods made to pass as facts in order manipulate stock prices for own gains. Citron's reports are usually damning in tone, armed with a provocative headline and followed up with a targeted social-media push, what they seem to do quite well is they are able to spin existing facts into a horrible scenario that reads very badly in order to create market panic.

While information Citron Research publishes are carefully selected and distributed in ways that do not break the law at first sight, the SEC and FINRA have overlooked the fact that Left and Citron gains are a result of distributing catalysts in an anticipation of substantial price changes due to public response in either panic, encouragement, or simply a catalyst action wave ride. Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic shortly after taking a trading position so they and their clients can make the most amount of financial gains on the expense of regular investors.
Just bought dec 31 300c, jack better put on a Santa suit and come down my chimney with tendies
I hope they all keep them and we open 55 on Monday.

Who can say but institutional short sellers are jumping on all the Chinese EVs bc they way too hot. As soon as all us retards lose all our money we will start dumping too. It‚Äôs gonna drop as fast as it climbed I think.
Put it in a high yield savings account. But you‚Äôre on WSB so idk buy some chinese stock or something.
So you‚Äôre betting that AMZN is going to go down?
February 2021 FSR calls on sale rn
so people moving from NIO to FSR?
Why the fuck do I even come to this sub when retards like this are doing "DD"
someone who people listen to said " it's a shit stock that's way overvalued"
the first thing is the problem, the second thing is fine
yeah it is. will go more low tho

I hear what you're saying and am buying acreage holdings anyways
Well that is for a reason, AAl and CCL have a ton of debt and a business model on a halt while the expenses pile on. Would not touch them with a stick atm.
I‚Äôm in the latter rn. I have leaps, good luck to you sir
Jesus.
Buy PLTR dude.
Calls?
1 short seller*
Nio is pulling back along it's support line. Won't drop below $42, and will eventually get back towards it's track to $60
Just start coughing. Either they'll take you in or you get kicked out, and in both cases you'll be out of there faster
Nope
You are reading what you want to hear, and I think you want to hear it as a conspiracy tweet. The average person will think it‚Äôs BULLSHIT to get a 50 percent accuracy on 4 tests. Redditors are truly something else.

Holy shit
If you bought NIO puts when it was at 54$ today, congratulations you made a 10 bagger.
What is wrong with TSLA???

My man
Biden win all about that oil & gas I guess.
No he is LYING to push his own agenda. He used a KNOWN inaccurate rapid test, but didn't tell the pubic that.

Standard PCR tests are VERY accurate. (i.e. what 99% of your average public gets)
I just bought lots of calls. Thank you.
Guys get off the Nio wagon and jump on FSR
Happening in 2 hours. 4pm
Lesson I learned this week, take your fucking gains before 10am. Fuck Citron and fuck mango man.
Jacked to the tits in these leaps
Brilliant
You‚Äôll be fine, it‚Äôs the buying and selling on the same day. Like if you bought NIO Today at open, got scared and sold. But if you bought nio yesterday and say Disney yesterday. And sold both today you‚Äôre fine
fucking NVDA wrong way
NICE 11:13 split on oct 24th CONFIRMED
Nah gonna wait eod dip to 15
I blame this all on NIO
find something to theta gang
Anybody else get a trade credit for all the glitching the other day? I got a $727 trade credit. Yep, looks like things are finally starting to turn around for me.
If I remember correctly, stocks usually go back to pre-citron article levels the next day. At least it was for TSLA and ENPH I think
[deleted]
Almost bought nio dip at 45$ ooffffffff.
Dont disagree but why buy such short dated puts when it sounds like you'll need more time for it to play out?

Dude, Africa is orders of magnitudes behind SE Asia and South America.

Mb bro
Rotation from NIO back into big cock TSLA
I think NIO is just one huge bear trap today if they get greedy and not sell their puts by EOD
Only on desktop?
Neither is the moon
SPY goes from +1.02% to +1.01% and VIX immediately starts pumping.

Fucking shit.
makes sense but i do think it'll go down in the short term, i already bought SPY 350P 11/18 in case it happens
Today is an uncorrelated desperate mess. They really can‚Äôt let this thing get out hand. Which, if they let their foot off the gas for a second, it will spiral out of control. GL! Stay vigilant.
Sold nio at 50 üòé
God I hope PLTR sells off so fucking hard for all the gloating bulls.
It is almost 20% off the highs. Seems a good place to start.
Calls on your wisdom !
When was that
[deleted]
[deleted]
Well, im holding 250P so....
SELL NIO
I think I‚Äôll hold, still got a week left to burn away. With shutdown orders coming, I still feel like AMZN is a clear winner.
Almost forgot what I was doin I‚Äôve been drivin I been smokin

You‚Äôre next level if you hold this through the weekend üòÇ
Just put a stop loss at $39 (low this week)
What would you do with 50k
Moderna announcement Monday
baba price too low imo
Looks like Nio dip is already slowing down

NIO earnings is gonna RAPE citron and citron will lose credibility forever. Earnings will be higher than the expected earnings and we fly to the moon

NVDA you dumb bitch
BA - next week's breakout is just starting gaurentee it moons AH tonight.
DKNG definitely.  Currently inside an ascending wedge with bearish divergence at open today.  completion of the bear flag puts it close to $20 but might take a while...
link, link now or ban
Rest of tech isn't dumping.. Google up 1.24%

AMD is following NVDA when it should be hanging with TSM. TSM is up almost 3%!
What happened to NIO? I'm new at all this, using practice money. Why did they tank so hard?
tech leaps entered... short term spxs calls activated
[deleted]
There will not be any stimulus happening until early next year, and it's going to be one large bill with Infrastructure and other things included.
So is it truly done climbing? Every time this thing takes a dump it‚Äôs like $10 higher two days later.
Yall retards buying pltr making me scared not buying in
smart, and congrats, I can see PLTR being at least 20$ by then
no way lol, these fuckers dont stop
Done chasing this market im buying long calls on spy and calling it a day, 1 day, be back tomorrow
Of course VIX starts pumping again. It simply won't fucking die even with market only 1% off ATH.
people don't realize how big the automobile market is and how a very small portion of vehicles out there are EV. Hence why Nio does not see tesla as competition. EV is the future
Fatality!!!
PLTR gang whalecumming all NIO gang members.
All LEAPS are free money if you're patient enough.

*cries in Boeing LEAPS*

Nio breaks 44 we drilling down to low low
Jesus christ, open interest. Most of the put holders are still holding.
can jack just say baba price too low imo ?
You sold 10,000 NIO STOCKS?

Wow, you really are retarded. 
You belong here bud!
Sorry boys I bought 11/20 17c PLTR... time for it to instantly tank
Are we holding Nio Xpeng and solo through the weekend?
Because he didn't say "I took 4 inaccurate rapid tests and got inaccurate results".

The average person will read his BULLSHIT tweet and think all covid tests are inaccurate, or worse the deniers will jump on it.
Was Mango yesterday, and Citron today smfh
no baba...you're trending the wrong direction my friend
Damn NIO really trying to form that bearish engulfing daily candle
Why ZM dying?  I figured NYC school closing would have been good news for them.
So why is everyone buying pltr again?
Then do straddles....they're insanely cheap now too.
You have no flair don‚Äôt talk to me bum
BABA beat PDD beat how can JD not beat
No.  


It's the next Apple. Buy and HOLD

If it breaks 44$ it‚Äôs a drill it has some support at 38-39$
[deleted]
This is actually a position I support. I think cyclicals are about to boom, but I think SPCE might outperform AAL and CCL and at the same time be capped by them. AAL and CCL have huge sell orders around the $13.00(aal) and $17.00(CCL) range. I‚Äôm waiting until Monday if Monday is a down day to buy in because I wasn‚Äôt able to get in at the $21.20 range.
60c Baby
Just the beginning my friend. Flew too high too fast. Institutional short sellers going to crash this party hard.

We built this city

We built this city on lots of Nio bags...
rip nio. is this just a short term dip or is it gonna stay under 50 for months?
Every time i see some gay bear shit I usually buy more.
kinda like how i played it, didnt over trade or anything, i kinda like not having calls over night...until we have a 2-3% gap up day on each index lol
[removed]
So puts? Is the uptrend the past few days it just trying to follow the China EV market?
Watched it go up 100% over the last week and a half I buy it today and it drops 16%
I say $42 then rocket to $55 EOM
LMAO. But to be fair he wasn't speaking his native language
Maybe On Monday we will finally stop hearing nio in here
Market acting like we're never gonna use Zoom again.. bitch I'm on a zoom call right now, pump that shit
Mango to speak at market close.
You're my hero.
I'm down with SPY 400c, yeah you know me.
pics or ban
I'm going to take a wack here and say 1/4 this sub (250k retards) got the thanos special from nio
Are we buying puts on DKNG and tsla today boys?
Did a voice in your head scream at you to stop from pressing the buy button?

May expiration.  Waiting until after new year to realize gains cause my tax bracket is stupid high this year.
What he means is buy puts on NIO.
Serious? Pls make a thread, I need jerking material
There‚Äôs a presser today? When?
Lololol he already tried and cases are getting thrown out left and right, see michigan and arizona. He's arguing 592 ballots in PA and the margin is like 60,000 votes. 

He knows he can't prove widespread voter fraud. He can't even reverse a single state def not the election. It's a last ditch money grab for donations to his slush fund since he lost his job due to rona just like the rest of us.
What is an AYRO? Srsly, these meme stocks are popping up way too fast for my tardy (pun!) brain to follow
Always has been
Yup, sold my boomer stock puts yesterday, bought calls today. It's been extremely easy money so far. If market juices up too much today/early next week there's a chance we dump after the annoucement, but I'm optimistic.

Elon is a WSB lurker and i bet he saw this and it made him super sad. Dont you feel like a piece of shit now?
Three posts about this in one day pumping this hard aren‚Äôt we.

Edit: four posts.
Here is a website idea for you: All of us should make a EOD, EOW prediction for stonks and ppl with more accurate predictions get ranked high. PPl with the least accurate prediction also displayed so other ppl can inverse them. Its like FB for WSB where you are allowed to post your stock prediction and the system automatically tracks the % win/loss. No need to buy or sell to make prediction.
Hell yeah brother, get in on the "good news, outlook, and reports" dump
Lucky I sold this morning for a small profit. Too bad you retards changed my mindset about my puts. Why would I ever listen to retards on the internet?!  Mmmmkayyy

oh no, WSB is catching on to NIO, time to close my position =\
NIO about to go to the upside-down. Exit calls if you‚Äôre holding.
Position or ban
Unless...you know...it keeps going down.

I'm bullish too but this pattern doesn't mean shit tbh rarely works
Over 1000 USA Covid deaths yesterday and over 150,000 new cases.   Has to be bullish as fuck in this market.
Buy puts on AMZN and nvda at eod?
pltr
its ok, we pump next week
I can't buy a pack of smokes without running into 9 guys you fucked
I've lost 240k on NIO, all my life savings. Now I'm broke af.
If you can't figure that one out, don't trade meme stocks
Spy bears gonna rope
i'm holding 11/18 3575's. i'll get rid of them Monday.
As soon as you get the vaccine, you're contractually obligated to throw your iPhone into the trash. It's a give and take.

So how much you up now?
yeah who the fuck has 60% battery at Noon when they are risking 250,000k on a fucking FD.

Edit: Those are the plays where you wake up naturally at 3am and start reading the news excited for futures to open so you can get so excited seeing them up only to fade all morning and then the SPY gap down at open and then BOOM you get this screenshot.  BUT your battery is at 15%.

Zoom, amazon dropping in anticipation of moderna vaxx news. Load up on IWM and DIA for next week. It's free money!

NVDIA Puts somebody ?
Hmmmm
Bro this is exaclty my thinking. 
Earnings next week going to make this moon 

Fuck citron and their shit projections.
Source?
If TSLA falls below $400, buying calls is literally free money.  IV is insssssanely cheap atm.  This is how you win on options.  By not buying shit when IVs are stupidly high.
JD earnings next Monday, hit or miss?
Can BYND pull a ZM rn
I just don‚Äôt see the hype on SOLO, though I guess it may get similar gas like NIO
Friday the 13th is an American horror franchise that comprises of twelve slasher films. Spooky day.

It's going to be cheaper and there will be some protectionism. China is going to have is electrical car companies because it wants to. Xi was pretty adamant on focusing inwards in his last 5 year plan. They have 1.6 billion people blossoming into a middle class, they aren't simply going to leave this market for grabs.
Citron is a short seller

Looks like the market expects another vaccine announcement next week.
Lockdowns will matter again after vaccine news. I'm literally going to go back to puts on all my positions as soon as the market settles from the news. I'm actually really happy moderna moved up the announcement bc now there's plenty of time for all these gains to whittle down, especially after Thanksgiving where it's basically guaranteed people will not socially distance.
trailing stop loss and I still fucked myself on NIO by buying in right after it executed smh
Too soon

Everybody knows the best future of EVs: SOLO, TSLA, NKLA

Sold my nio, bought more PLTR
They likely sold off their tech shares so it doesn't tank them as much. That is what the last week of October was for. Sector rotation.

its a shitty Canadian EV company. Over valued and doesnt even have a working product
Fake. CNBC only has 1 African American contributor on TV a week.
You may have a hernia, or internal bleeding
IV is too high and NIO has a lot of fomo and dip buying going on. So be careful.
I would love for him to throw everyone threw a loop and concede.
Just bought 1k share NIO at $44

how?
Lol at zm gangüòÇüòÇ
Biggest brain plays right here
Depending on how the rest of the day goes I'll just exit them today Or exit maybe half of them. Depending on what mango says we could see spy 350 or spy 370 on Monday.
Lol you‚Äôre not even joking
Monday ATH was around $45 before it pulled back to $39. Now it's holding above $44.50 after it hit $54 this morning. I think we hold here and keep climbing to $55 by Monday EOD.
Since it dumped already, I'm going in on Monday

There‚Äôs no need for the media to control the narrative. Only reason he isn‚Äôt already charged is because he‚Äôs President. Don‚Äôt forget he‚Äôs still Individual 1 in the Michael Choen trial which implicated Trump directly with serious criminal charges. And that‚Äôs just 1 case.

That‚Äôs awesome I went for 340p 12/31
my idea for next week is SPY dropping... so inverse me please cuz i bought spy/dia puts yesterday thinking today was going to be a pull back day... fukn MMs got me good at the end of power hour with that bitch ass bear trap

&#x200B;

i havent been right about spy since before the election... inverse my ass and make money
Hmmm okay i could see that, but then again if the fee is measly it doesn't seem profitable, and equipping a shopping mall with thousands of parking lots with even a couple % of these wont be cheap. Will consider a small position tho
Was nervous my 3 ZM 11/13 400p would expire worthless today, but here we are. Who would‚Äôve thought!
Who else is still holding NIO through earnings?

how they come up with such a cool name for something so mundane?
Entry level gayness is trying to trade that stock, congrats on reaching a new level by trying to trade it based on technicals
The tax is applicable to your country of residence and the instrument in which you made money. 

May be different rules for dividends/capital gains/dtfs etc.
Congrats! And I mean it truly.

I just think of the NIO situation like when scientists come out year after year with back and forth on whether coffee is good for you or not.


If NKLA has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that even after a major fucking scandal ppl will still invest in you
250% gain and crying? Cry when it's 100% lost
my city (not chicago) is starting to talk about lockdowns again.
FUBO, PPD, PTON, PLUG, SPCE if you‚Äôre going for growth
737 MAX might get approved by FAA next week
8% in 14 hours is pretty good imo
If you‚Äôre not holding spy poots you ain‚Äôt black
he won't say anything except that he actually won the election
It'll close 5% down today as big money start to buy the dip right before earnings. Then moons 10+ percent both Monday and Tuesday through earnings where it will pull back a little as people take profit.
All I know is I'm buying. People losing faith in Papa, but that man does not lose.

Wait so you're telling me NIO tanked right before a earnings report that will be stellar, and after an election that will allow them to sell fully in the US most likely, just because 1 short seller said a negative thing about the stock? That's the market I guess.

Good.   I've watched 100% profits turn to negative.  And then I cry and drink.  My 20k in zoom calls doubled to 40k.  If I held overnight it would have been 80k.  But profit is better than homelessness.

Imma need some asshole to explain to me why BIDU isn‚Äôt up 3-5% today when they have earnings on Monday. BILI & JD moon their ass off too, I mean I can understand BABA being down but c‚Äômon BIDU

Edit: setting higher lows tho and bouncing off the 200dma. Maybe this will be the best earnings play of the MCHI since ut hasn‚Äôt pumped as much as the others listed
Does anyone wanna buy a ZM 445c 11/20 off me for $1100 lol
Today doesn‚Äôt feel like a green day at all
So is NIO still worth more than GM?

I‚Äôm just gonna let it ride. Year later numbers will speak for themselves. Might trade in and out a bit but holding at least for x5. Made a mistake of selling tsla too early, and same with some other plays.

Btw look into OSS, good one as well although has some risk factors
[deleted]
Nah NIO though might be soon
Can Citron finally publish a short report on SPY?
Lol I'm out of fucking money GME is my biggest position if you don't count unrealized gains/losses (thanks NIO!)
What a fun week guys
Lmao you are truly autistic. Enjoy your CCL calls retard
So we‚Äôre all bullish on NIO (China sales 75% y/y) and bearish on TSLA (growing 120% y/y)?

Just want to make sure so I know how to place my inverse WSB trade.

They were shorting them for awhile two years ago, but nothing really negative about the company---they were commending their management but just questioned the valuation at the time.

eod pump or dump?
I hope you're right!
I cant purchase warrants at the moment anyways. After CEO does not get fucked by 'murica, i'll buy a lot of SRAC and hopefully SRACW as well.

A lot in my case means much less than going all in, like for WSB tards. Its not like i would big percentage of my $$ if the merger doesnt go through.
I know œÇŒìyœÅœÑŒø is frowned upon here but years ago I sold 240 ETH for $3000 when it was like $10 per. A year later it was worth 400K. Shit happens.

No spy be cucking some days.
BEST new meme stock GF
yep, and I have a OTM call as well
They buy and buy and buy and then JPowell messages in the groupchat "sell" and then everyone sells
lmao. perfect timing OP. Why are people homeless? They buy retardedly overpriced options with 150+ IVs on stupid meme stocks and absurdly valued bubbles like Nio and lose their shirts.
Who fucking cares what Trump has to say about operation warp speed "Vaccine close!" still going to take months to get it out. Doubling down next week if it opens below 100.
This is exactly what I‚Äôm playing. I‚Äôve got a range of puts 30-45 nov20-dec 4th. Nio don‚Äôt fuck me now

green but im a boomer who only buys SPY shares
stairs up, elevator down
Everyone who bought puts are at +200%. If they didn‚Äôt sell 1/2-2/3 they‚Äôre being greedy. Best to sell partial and hold the rest with ‚Äúhouse money‚Äù so even if nio spikes they go back to break even.
Solo the next Nio and Li. Move on over!
Strike?
The long answer is yes, the short answer is no. The trade deal will obviously be reversed after Biden's inauguration.
NIO still on an uptrend
TDOC is a shitty company, they couldn't figure out to go 5x during this once in a lifetime opportunity.  Competition is plenty and others have better tech.  I have used TDOC. Guh.

I was up +400 with 2 weeks left on my calls, then next day was down a full 1k at open. Glad i cut my losses there bc theyd be worthless
I have spy puts
Wow, they really can‚Äôt let this thing go. It will be a disaster. Low volume means JPow/LFink can do what they like.
Have you guys noticed how share prices typically take a long time to reach a certain point, and then fall down from that point in a matter of minutes? It‚Äôs so hard to watch.

Your good bro if you wait it out.

Its because of High speed algo trading. More than 75% of entire trading is done by automated computers without human interference. They read news from whole internet in microseconds and buy/sell stock based on sentiments. They must have shorted both NIO and XPEV seconds after Cytrone published its paper.
For the first time in a long time, I got out at the top. Feels good.
Btw, I had 45c before market closed yesterday,
Was down because I had bought at a high so I lost money, sold the call at 250, but puts at 2:55 and like a retard did the same thing you did
Aka the flying car
Thanks will do... my life savings are gone
Picked up Tesla and ford 2023 leaps

RH won't let me trade 0DTE yet so I just grabbed puts for Monday and I'll probably use a day trade to get out of them. Or not.

Just hold until Tuesday and hope it gets back to 54
NIO is just consolidating and getting ready to coil up from a dark pool poolage of buyers to take it to 60 today.  I just know it.

KEEP DUMPING NIO BOYS!! WE GONNA BUY LOW AND SELL HIGH AFTER EARNINGS REPORT!!!!

Yeah, the problems with that are 1) insanely expensive options, and 2) I could see orange man dragging his feet on it just because, and us not getting it until late January

It's gotta be. You have to throw it into concentrated plays and cross your fingers.

Good luck with that.

Remember if there's a vaccine it means online shopping grinds to a halt because everyone will go to brick and mortar stores which they stopped doing even before a pandemic but you know, now that there's a vaccine, you'll change your shopping habits simply because your house smells like beer and farts from being home for months.

The report DESTROYS NIO.
And I could cut my losses quick if we start shooting up
NIO is going to the moon. I got shares, holding this bitch til next year when the Chinese invade our country and force everyone to make NIO cars to sell on BABA

I'm going to pretend to understand this and upvote it.

Hell yeah! Was thinking this is a temp dip. Holding Dec calls
Companies like this offer free charging. Shopping centers and the like will pay the measly cost of electricity plus rent on the station to draw in customers that have to be there for an hour or two. I suppose EV charging stations in this way have created the elusive "free lunch".
We are done caring about covid. Get with the program

NIO will drill periodically until it makes you lose your mind. Then it will sit around for a day or two for people to forget about it.

And then once you‚Äôve turned your back it‚Äôs flying to the moon again
TSLA at 400 is free money right?
From up 25k in the morning to down 10k. Had a similar ride w/ NIO this past Tuesday. I'm holding.
It‚Äôs been flat for a while. It‚Äôs gonna jump to 50 eod
Lives>money
Well boys. What‚Äôs the new ‚ÄúNIO‚Äù now?
So yes? I don‚Äôt have much money on my account. Will robinhood pay the 70c with my 60c for me, or do I need the collateral cash on my account?
What is your DD?
I would kill myself if I saw that much money evaporate in front of my eyes
Guys don‚Äôt be dumb and buy NIO now! Wait until it‚Äôs pumping over $50 again!

Sold at 51.70, so happy.
Just floatin a 6 digit loss all casual-like
that report looks like the biggest joke I've ever seen. the formatting, the way he wrote "bil" wtf is this, written by a high school dropout?
Lol warrants? Thats so dumb what if the merger dont come through? Still really possible with the ceo debacle
NIO hit my stop loss at 51 so I'm good, its going back to the 50s after earnings.

Damn it was $200 in 2017 lmao
There will be, trust me üòò
Does anything have a higher short % of float than SPCE? It‚Äôs almost 90

I wouldn‚Äôt do that due to EA‚Äôs earnings. TTWO has different revenue streams so EA aligns with ATVI a lot more.

EA missed so I like the play heading into January earnings. I totally agree though next Q it‚Äôs going to fucking print.

I guess they are all the same and it‚Äôs semantics.

This is extremely bullish right? SPY didnt reject resistance and head straight back down like every other time
[deleted]
363c 11/23
Bc they‚Äôre already -99%
NIO reminds me of TSLA in that when TSLA hit $500, 9 out of 10 ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù said to short the shit out of it.
Four months later it was trading at $2400
I think there is some significance in the fact that Chinese EVs are doing horrible today while other EVs are at least staying afloat (fsr, solo) while others (F) are flourishing. Dont know how to factor in TSLA

Lots of small dick energy today. MMs are active
NIO/XPEV/LI gonna go back up to the market open price by EOD. That grade 12 short report is ridiculous. Did people actually read that before selling?
This reminds me of the old gene simmons tv show.

Hey Siri, how to have Ma and Xi to make love again.
Now that NIO is over I'm looking at all other stocks that exist, WTF TSLA? Are people getting back in?

it's counterintuitive
They just wanted cheaper NIO calls

Mu $90c was my first meme stock on wsb ü•∫ where has the time gone
It literally said take your profits and go to the next meme. 

üòÇ
It will finish the day over your break even point, just chill
It doesn't. NIO (nor any other stock that anybody here cares about) isn't part of that list.
Why are lawyers in PA quitting then? The campaign also dropped suit in AZ.
If WSB keeps demanding spy to fall it will do the opposite. This is hilarious.
NKLA to the üåï

Their 5 year high is like 10. Throw in 5k to PLTR. Buying more shares once we get a 15 dip.
Yep, 100%. Only the biggest losers are currently getting amped up for COVID "The 2nd Wave". These are people who prey on weakness and desperation to obtain money.

ZM has benefit of being a "Covid Phenomena", although the price is insane. TSLA loves 420 by nature, not saying that it belongs there either ( I own stocks, though )
I just wish I rode nio last week. I have trust issues with super hyped stocks lol
I was feeling the same way about Amazon. It seems to be stuck at 3k but with holidays and other potential shut downs I can see it going up
I have no idea what the market wants to do, so for now I‚Äôll be sitting in the corner booth of WSB drinking lemonade from a water cup
What‚Äôs your cost AVG? 48$?
Wait till monday. Thank me later
Load up on NIO calls
When one meme stock dies another must rise! SPCE is doing a space flight next week. Calls will go to space with it. Load up!
oh i absolutely agree...i was just expecting it to be an overpriced junk box taking advantage of the silly people in california.
VIX calls, SPY puts

Exactly my thoughts. I feel like CCP has released bots to pump NIO on reditt
casue youre just obnoxious cheerleaders, which have no affect on the price. youre just an echo chamber flooding conversations and drowning out other legitimate DD's

Im all for all of us making tendies. But fuck people who flood the DD threads
How does BA have retard strength rn
Just stop thinking logically and it makes sense
Pump markets or dump
NIO should go down until 30$ range. Its pattern matches tesla‚Äôs high of 500$ to fall back to 320$ range.
I shouldnt have pussied out of that bet
I bought 15 mins before fucking citron report released..
Hands up mfs, which ones you bought NIO at the top today?
Yeah... We're gonna need a backstory to this

I can‚Äôt say this more clearly. If you want to make millions of dollars, do yourself a favor and get some AYRO calls. Bye

If this aint bofton, I'mma hang Ma.
Nio bois, come to PLTR, if you can get in below 15 great. Otherwise next week will be HYPE
According to this sub you‚Äôre retarded to ever think that. Okay yeah it‚Äôs about to shit the bed.

Hard to keep up when nothing actually in it is doing well. Tape action is incredibly suspect.
Yeah, planned economies only suck for those who have to fund the planning. 

Chinese unique brand of communism-capitalism is fun to watch. We can all get rich by china subsidizing our gains on the backs of their people. 

And here I thought USA had some greedy bastards. Bernie Madoff was in the wrong country.
Fucking me in the asa that's what
What do you think of Palantir?
Let‚Äôs hope for a big be back
Pls put your 401k into it now! I need it to close $19 in hour and a half
That would be really sad for Jack Ma, but he's not the CEO anymore, just the largest shareholder. CCP is saying that Alibaba is their company, not his. And when they are done flexing on Ma they will see BABA go much higher.

Understand if it's not your trade though, just wanted to give the Bull case.
When‚Äôs the expiration?

In bocca al lupo!
Same
monday 9am eastern time
No problem bro. Try not to listen to people here who see no upside to this hedge. I am not predicting the markets to go to zero again, but I do expect 5%-10% when it happens I want to sell those covered calls have them expire in the money and then use the money I have between the premium and the shares to keep buying the dip. Right now I buy calls 200 days out and I bounce out of them in a week. Why? Well this market can tank any day now. The outflows from the biggest names and institutions pulling out of corporate debt and into other assets are not bullish signs. Also the insider selling we‚Äôve been seeing? Practically no one is buying shares in their own companies. This market can still go up yes and I‚Äôll play it like that, but the bearish thesis outweighs the bullish ones for sure.
Same here man. I thought it was me. Sounds like it was us.

I'm saying give it 2 years and it'll be up there and that's a pretty long time for nowadays, scaling up a company like that who already manufacturers their own peripherals that just IPOd and is booming, isn't that hard to believe
It's okay I bought puts at 2:30 yesterday when it was 352.50.

I don't know... seems like a penny stock scenario, doesn't seem like something the SEC would favor either. Do you have any evidence of this happening with multi-billion dollar companies? 

Looking at a recent bankruptcy: SEARS, it's pretty obvious the company wasn't in great financial shape. Starting in 2007 when the stock started to plummet, you can see their revenue consistently dropping year on year until they finally filled chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018.  Seems to me like the "bag holders" are just dumb money.

>The company‚Äôs results initially sent shares of Chinese EV rivals higher, until Citron put out a note via a tweet on why NIO (NIO), which has soared 1000% year-to-date, will go down to $25 a share. ‚ÄúNIO has found itself in unchartered territory that can never be justified by its current standing in the China EV market or its near-term prospects,‚Äù said the Citron note.

Citron Research went on to say, ‚ÄúIt is time for investors to rotate out of NIO, enjoy your profits and look for the next disruptive technology.‚Äù

Can't go tits up with WSB DDs
On its way now
I will enter soon - I‚Äôve decided to postpone my entry date due to timelines that were communicated, but I‚Äôll just spill it to keep my promise. The stock that I was looking at was BABA. They‚Äôre pretty much on a freeze and they‚Äôre on a downward trend (or might go horizontal for a few days) after the antitrust, ant holdings‚Äô fail ipo and the new monopoly rule briefings. Fear levels are pretty high for this stock as they are expected to receive possible public regulatory demands before the month of November. Personally, I don‚Äôt think a lot will come into fruition and even if it does, the price right now is unjustified for a stock that has an average YoY growth of 40% - partially due to covid. Nevertheless, this is a behemoth of a stock and this will shoot back up to at least 310 levels once the hearings are over. Was looking at Feb calls. Right now, those calls are being IV crushed at extremely high levels, so it might be worthwhile to wait. Again, I will write a DD once I enter.

>ppl try to use TA to predict the future. but where TA really shines is at explaining. 

Thanks, that really fits with my impression of TA and what I mostly see of it. It can explain, or at least describe, things that happened. But it gets iffy with predicting the future.

>so rather than one future you think of possible timelines so if one of those timelines happens then you know what's happening and can react instead of spending time figuring it out.

Makes sense I think. You use TA to figure out possible or likely scenarios and then prep a plan for each? Then you try to see which scenario is happening and act out the appropriate plan

>so like yesterday the Fed spoke and it instantly dropped the market through a couple supports. ok so what's the next hard support below that? where are we likely to bounce? if you already know that beforehand then you don't need to figure it out.
>
>let's say we keep bouncing off of resistance. ok so why is that a resistance? how solid is it? secret is that I don't know *the* future that will happen. I know possible *futures* that might.

Yeah that makes sense. I kinda want to say that something like yesterday is big enough to break a lot of forecasting, but then it happens with enough frequency that you kinda need to prepare for it too, right? 

But you need more than just TA to figure out what's likely to hold and what's likely to break

I think the US government got lucky.  They made a small investment subsidizing Tesla, and it opened the flood gates.  EV has likely passed the bubble stage and the old manufactures are finally getting on board.  And rather than having to subsidize further, the gov gets to rely on competition between the autos.

It's going up with the EV market. This shit should be a penny stock. Unbelievable.

Agreed! It came out in the middle of a strong trading day. They probably shorted the stock and released this in hopes of recovering some of their losses.

Yes, this is how fast stupid bubbles deflate.  Same crap this year with ridiculous garbage like Hertz.  Many people will lose half or more of their gamble because they refuse to sell for a loss before it is too late.  This is what happens with insanely speculative crap like Nio, Li, and Xpev.

Thank you.
Assuming it cost $35 to buy this option:
If it hits $30 by exp date, there will be no gain. If it hits $29 by exp date, you'll gain about $65 ($100 - $35) via exercising the option. It is hits $28 by exp date, you'll gain about $165 ($200 - $35) via exercising again.
If you reach $30 before exp date, just sell the option.

TLDR: pray it goes down towards $30 in large gaps before 11/19.
Come on jnug. Wake up!
Why
Hope so. Should be much higher but needs more hype

which mysterious stocks pulling spy up?
That means it has support at $44.50 or so, which would be the bottom
Never said it‚Äôs unprofitable but the stock will never take off when the black market can undercut it always. If you take that offensively and want to argue fine but it doesn‚Äôt change that fact. That exact reason is why every pot stock tanked after their ipo and has yet to reach that level again.

It was $44.50 twice, either way I think it's definitely above $50 at some point before earnings and it could easily moon to $55-60 if they beat their earnings like the other EVs did. Citron has tried shorting other companies in the past. I'm not buying their valuation right before NIO's ER lol

I pray to JPOW you add to the tendie bucket
Let me guess- Nio?
Who says I didn‚Äôt play options
Chris Farleys cousin being made Ford‚Äôs CEO is going to be the best move a company has made since Jobs was brought back to Apple.

Ford $11+ by Christmas
Didn‚Äôt you hear some ubs analyst with no medical background said there will be 0 cases in q2.
RIP $NIO.
Everyone wants to hear EV puts
You retards need to stop posting about nio

Buy nio they said
i sold my nio puts for a loss at market open, AMA
48c EOD?
How is Honda growing their business?
Bro you tweaking, your not even making sense
yes they're going to declare bankruptcy after this
NIO w/ record high volume w/ 3 hours left in the trading day. Strong feeling NIO will rocket back up, squeeze the shorts and get another fomo rally
I'm up $1800 today and I had to google what you meant by 'charts'
I don‚Äôt even invest, I just like watching these tards lose their life savings
400,000 Total deaths by March, BULLISH.
Then you definitely know the way üëçüèª
Shares are still the way imo. Long term, gunna pick up more if it drops in the 30's. Stop losses set for 44.50 rn
Or expires, next friday
Vox is getting ready for the weekend
To the moon
Get drunk - maybe laid
That's how you keep feeding the confirmation bias.
If you listen to the bears it is who are bearish because they finally bought calls. 

Or you use your head and see what caused the fall and use it to your advantage to buy shit on sale INSTEAD of when it‚Äôs pumping like crazy.
can't spell bullshit without bullish
Same! Hoping for the best next week

Nice. I'll be picking up some of those as well
How would that make sense.

If you bought it on Monday morning after a 4% up day for spy then you‚Äôre a real retard

SPY volume is 25m compared to 75m daily avg. About 2:40 mins to go (40%). At-least another 25m volume action left. I think it will drop back to 354 and end the day with mid 355.5

Jpow just vacuuming up the bid, doesn‚Äôt need anything else.

Going to 42 today. 35 after earnings release.
i‚Äôm immensely stiff in my midsection
How confident are you? Like 70
For your sake I hope this is fake, but based on the notice at the bottom I don't think that's the case. . .
Is it possible Citron downgraded and purposely crashed NIO to get in cheaper for earnings?

I‚Äôm asking this as someone who is cash gang considering yolo‚Äôing before close, no positions atm.
Low volume pumps as of lately. Was hoping for a change since we are at ATH.

I just figured it would tag along for the EV ride, I owned it a while back and there was no movement so I sold it.

Maybe we should just be permabulls.

I mean when you post record profits aka have a lot of cash on your hands, and your stock doesn't move...
Let's just start our own website. I guess that's all it takes to move the market. It's all good though bro. Hold until earnings and we'll be alright. NIO dropped 33% a while back and it came back no problem. The earnings will pull us back. If Li Auto and XPENG did good. Expect NIO to do good as well.

John Galt () is a character in Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged (1957). Although he is not identified by name until the last third of the novel, he is the object of its often-repeated question "Who is John Galt?" and of the quest to discover the answer.

That stock's average movement is about .005%/year.  IV is negative on those options.  If you could take a glacier public, it would move faster than PFE.  1 month treasury bonds are aggressive investments in comparison.
Sideways.
Let‚Äôs name the ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù companies: TSLA, SQ, PTON, SHOP.
Idk. What that means. I know very very little. But I do know NIO will be 35 Tuesday end of day
It's been squeezing ever since it got to the 257 area support. It's setting up for decent move. Didn't say it will go up, said hopefully it will go up. If the move is down, we're going to head toward 250-252. Hoping it goes to at least 261 though.
Don't tease me
what makes you say that?

Bought $11 calls for Jan back in October bc GE is a FUCKIN giant, too big to fail
The volume on NIO is insane. Almost $400M. It's not over yet, boys.
Nio is trading down projecting to have three times the average volume r.i.p
You uppity uppity UPPIty NIO sons of bitches psyched me out of buying a put this morning when I wanted to do it just to spite you fuckers goddammit god damn all you NIO turds fuck
You go to GE exchange , Click buy, and then hammer it with everything u have
Buying the dip? Cashed out my 12/18 35c yesterday at the top, scoping the 1/15 50c right now
God I love seeing the bitch boy NIO bandwaggoners cry in here
hmmm... the 618 PE ratio makes this very tempting
[removed]
Oh no
I got in at the dip. Feels good
You got herps instead
Did ANYONE jump into CZR? Gutted I cannot trade it as not on platform (Trading 212)
following that logic, how is JP Morgan upgrading their NIO target to 40 when the stock was trading at 20 not stock manipulation? Its the way the game works buddy
Yay the mango is doing what he was supposed to do, lets pump to all time highs!! Fucking bullshit
You know what‚Äôs funny? If we saw this dip yesterday it would actually be normal and not really that bad. That‚Äôs how much NIO went up overnight lmao
my only regret is that i have boneitis
Exactly 5 years ago today, I took the GREs then came out of that several hours long wormhole to find out about the Paris attacks. They're still dealing with that shit and I'm still not in grad school. Some things never change.

SPY 202.54 EOD
At least I didn't FOMO 50c's like most people here and be at -90%.
It dropped 15% from this mornings high,just goes to show how stupid the stock is
Out of all the chinese stocks I could have played JD, PDD, NIO or XPEV but in the end I only have long positions in BABA LMAO

What does it means? Should I hold through ER or sell? Up +30% on 18 dec 100 calls
Steady growth, will increase long term, will give short term gains this week
Careful, lot of pennystonk bagholders going to be wanting to exit; esp. if it's just moving in sympathy with the other EVs and not on other news; I haven't looked into it.

stock market hasn't cared about covid for a while dude
I'd dump. It's bounced back from 45 a few times today I think that might be the bottom. No actual catalyst to fuel this drop besides one "analyst".
Yeah, penny stocks. I bought HOME at a 1.93 a share (200 shares) and sold it in Oct for $24 a share. My brother-in-law did more impressive trades with penny stocks.
Just fucking sell it trust me
it quiet in here, too quiet

ZM calls and BYND puts

Market investing me rn ugh
dont listen to that voice. thats the voice that takes money from the idiots and dumb people in the market. the smart people like me and you ignore that voice and take small gains day by day, sale by sale. even .01% is a gain and good. anything over 5% is honestly too big and you should be selling and cashing out way before that. also never hold overnight, ever. always be cash when the market closes, always.

Literally caused a panic sell by putting the headline on millions of robinhood users apps lmao but they are the ones who are gonna make money and never go to jail
NIO has retard monkey strength.  An assessment from a company that shares a name with a shitty French car is not going to hurt NIO.

Nio will blast off up to earnings and everyone will have missed this dip
üòÇüëç so when people started buying the dip on tsla and then they continued to have great news and crush earnings. They didn‚Äôt buy back in and continue to add on dips that are waaay higher than where they originally took profit? Holy Jesus. The fact that you think it‚Äôs over for NIO when the rally is just starting is cute. The average 52 week mark is 155 a share. Yes 54 was high. It will dip. Many times. And peak. Many times. But it will continue to go up over the long term like all good stonks do üëå

‚ÄòNotorious short seller‚Äô pumps a stock and then after its well and taken off completely 180s their opinion and dumps it. Why do people even pay attention to that shit lmao
They love those feelings. üî™
Yes exactly what you said. I try to keep 5-10% like that in an environment like this. We know it‚Äôs not the economy driving it higher and we know stimulus is dead. I‚Äôm not one of those bears calling for the market to hit 0, but what I will do if we get a 5-10% correction I‚Äôll let my shares get bid higher sell ITM calls that are already higher than what I‚Äôve paid. If these calls expiry ITM then I take that money and I‚Äôll buy the dip which I would of already been doing. If they don‚Äôt then I hold onto my hedge and just keep going long. Like I said in this environment you don‚Äôt want to be naked. I see tons of people buying calls on volatility though problem with that is the market has been slow bleeding.

Not a bad idea if you have the capital and can hold. Crayons say it may tag $240 if it can't hold this level though. I'm pretty long so I think/hope it holds.
If you are healthy and in your 20-30s, you are more likely to die from a car accident on a normal day.

HFTs. 

Here‚Äôs an example: let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a seller of fruits at an open market. You notice that when an apple‚Äôs price goes up, so does a pear‚Äôs price. You use this correlation to increase your pear‚Äôs price if you see apple‚Äôs price increasing.

Now imagine super fast massive computers that have correlated that if the price of NIO goes down, so should the price of LI. How long do you think it takes a computer to sell LI when it sees NIO drop? Not longer than a second.
This is a dump EOD, right?

I‚Äôm about to sell 4 contracts of BABA 250. 100k collateral. Am I dumb or a secretly smart? The risk reward seems enticing. I‚Äôll bag hold for years if needed.

Lol is it gonna be Geraldo PUMP or Geraldo DUMP
Pricing in the üò¥ win
Back in NIO
The idea is once the CCP steps off its neck it will rocket back to where it was. Jack Ma just needs to go kiss the ring-- and he will because he's smart enough to know he's on the losing end of this play. Ant Financial will probably IPO in early 2021-- which will be a humungous win for BABA.

I just have 10 shares. I‚Äôll probably sell closer to earnings. I don‚Äôt think startup EVs are the move long term. Honda said they are aiming for a full lineup of electric cars by 2025. Once the major players go electric, the small fries won‚Äôt be able to compete. I personally would never buy a Tesla (or any other EV) over a major player like Honda or Toyota

We don‚Äôt need no water let the mf burn
I actually didn't, surprisingly. Just a a bad call here and there because I'd chase different stocks instead of sticking to a few and learn them well. Got burned on AMD, NLS, and that drastic spike then dip about a week ago was buying a few calls on ACB during the election and having it spike to 800% and me being a dumbass and not selling or having a stop loss, so it lost a lot of value the next day. Thankfully I had one NIO $40c for 1/15 that I bought when NIO was roughly $25.
>How do i buy a bot that can trade for me?

Call the SEC

I wish people would stop comparing traditional automakers to EV companies. Is Tesla worth more than the next 4 largest market cap automakers in the world right now? Absolutely not. Is their stock likely to drop to 1/4 of the current price to reflect that? No.

Clearly the market see EVs as separate entities from traditional automakers. If you think GM can eventually beat out Tesla in the EV race then go invest in GM and wait for it to become valued like an EV company. My bets on Tesla in the US and NIO in China.
This is the same research firm that called Shopify a scam and set price target of 60 when the stock price was 150. Can‚Äôt believe people still believe them.

Edit 60 not 50
NIO = 40 EOD
Let‚Äôs come together and spam with solo calls. Market cap is low and you all can make money. The cars are funny looking but who cares ?

Dude trying to time it right now is so difficult. 

I hear so many people talking about the fed buying up stocks to keep the market propped up. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or just people upset that the market is going up and they‚Äôre losing money on their puts.

I have a feeling that as soon as Biden takes office it‚Äôs all going to come crashing down.

Sell and buy 11/27 calls, breh
Biggish move incoming within the next hour, hopefully the direction is up.
So you baghold spxs shares in an upward market waiting for a collapse so you can then sell calls against it? Or did you already sell the calls and didn't understand that it's the fucking BUYER, not you, that gets the gain of the call if the market tanks? Don't be mad because it seems like you totally misunderstood how a call seller gets paid.

Buying NIO at the top is like doubling down on a hard 17, I deserve this.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, fuck China. Yo, buy $UBER though. I've made over $20k and averaged up to 1000 shares by buying calls. This company has such a bright future with its current leadership.
Oh man. Best of luck. Only advice I can give you is get out of your own way.
gtfo of stocks. you got no debt. no point in playing this shitty caisno
Think about why it fell today. 

If the only answer is because of Citron...there‚Äôs your answer.

Bought NIO 45p yesterday EOD, and was panicking how high it was going AH. Woke up late today and sold for 15% profit, with a sigh of relief (though I could have made 60% more, but at least I didn't sell at a loss).

Then like retard, bought 0dte 46c when it dipped even lower, and sold for 50% profit using my last DT. 

Fuck this market.
Why does nobody talk about FSR?
Honestly tech has been profitable - earnings wise but remained so dormant for the past 3 months - it will gap up one fine day to ATHs.. Scared to buy puts on them..

way better than being in baba
Should I sell my NIO puts currently up 100 percent but feel like it has room to go down even more
Eh, options represent anywhere from 20-30% of my account and I think that‚Äôs how a decent number of folks roll here.  

I added to watch list though because it‚Äôs a decent premise.  Just way better with a Republican in charge of the executive branch.
Surprised how cheap PFE calls are for mid 2021.

Went up a ton on Meme tech stocks, FTCH, RKT, NIO and down on BABA and AAPL. This is not how that's supposed to go

The fact that people are buying NIO right now completely disapproves efficient market theory.

That‚Äôs about the most retarded response I could‚Äôve gotten lol. Yes I understand the percent change from 1 to 50 is larger than 5 to 50. But here‚Äôs the thing bud. It didn‚Äôt start at 5 did it. And it is that high in percent gain. I hate to break it to you but when people see the stock they bought at 1 go to 50 they sell. And when people sell the stock price goes down. These concepts might be new to you but I promise they‚Äôre true

You understand the % is only so high because of where the stock was right? Like if it was at $5 instead of $1 it wouldn‚Äôt be up anywhere near as high in percent? The news has been coming out since last earnings bud. And it‚Äôs global dynamic switch into the EV market.
Even if you limit it in scope, the Chinese EV companies can't really compete with Honda and Toyota without some sort of crazy trade protectionism and I doubt they do that.  The Chinese EV product just isn't going to be as good or as effectively produced by more experienced manufacturers like Toyota and Honda who have better engineers, designers, and factories

The premium on a otm spxs Dec call is about 10 cents a share. Also who the hell holds a daily rebalanced 3x fund when it's not moving up? I'm guessing you are either full of crap or have done this for like a week. Here's a hint, when the market moves against you the fund will drop more than 3x. When the market moves sideways the fund will drop. You seem to think that when you sell covered calls you get the gain of the call. You don't, that's what the buyer gets. You only get the premium at the time you made the sale. It sounds to me like you have made some seriously wrong moves.

My business feels like it could become kinda slow for the foreseeable future, so I've  been looking for ways to cut back on expenses in case this lasts for like a year or longer. I'm used to eating out 1-2 meals per day, and my usual food budget is something like $25-30 per day. 

Holy fuck, you can save a lot of money by buying shit from the frozen foods section. Puts on my cardiovascular system, but I just bought an entire freezer full of food for like $30. Will probably last me 60 days at least.

here is my dd: Ford is now an EV company and thus should be worth 10 times current market cap.
been looking at the unusual whales alerts recently. what's the difference between a regular alert, a bid side alert and an ask side alert?
Which ticker touched your no no?
Solo pump again tho and it‚Äôs Canadian not Chinese
[deleted]
vaccine news will kill it from going beyond 450 until perhaps after earnings. Right now people don't want to risk bag holding if it drops to 300 or lower.
Fair and valid points. Yes, I was considering holding longer term - I know - not the forum for that.
you're poor

I‚Äôve said before that Buzz Lightyear should be the NIO mascot
Cause I bought calls obv
Yeah I bought the dip but it's not recovering lol
Yolo SOLO small car big pp
Hope indeed
i bet once contracts expire today nio goes back up around 49
some reopening stocks up some down, chaos
Nio will end green
I feel like WSB doesn‚Äôt understand SPY.  This is 500 of the largest cap companies on the planet.  Just because you lost 80% on your NIO calls doesn‚Äôt mean to buy SPY puts.
This is the way
Switch to Edge, it's the best browser option. Chrome rendering engine for compatibility and performance, but works best with Windows.
I've seen many of theirs fuck up. I remember them trying a hit piece on SHOP when they were at 120. Dip lasted like an hour and then... lol
I play the same up and down game and I know the rally into ER but again your mornings puts were literally Hail Marys on a day that, sans Citron, would have lost most of their value. 

You made money on the puts and good for you. I‚Äôm still up on my calls but again it was a Hail Mary that happened to connect on a blue moon. Nothing more nothing less.

Looking at them NIO & PLTR has me all jealous. In Su Bae, I trust. Please deliver us austists to the promised land
It‚Äôs so obvious is quite disturbing tbh look at the cruise lines and airlines
I'd give you Silver for this, but I might need that money if Nio keeps dropping.

I bought stonks for 6 bucks back in march. I still dont know how to do options in Europe (we dont have Robinhood). Sold majority today. I keep 20% of my initially bought amount - they are free anyway.
SPY $350p 11/20. The only way
Yeah, moderna said yesterday that results next week. Fauci said it should be just as effective as the pfizer one yesterday as well. Don‚Äôt need unusual whales for that one. It was all over mainstream news
covid who?
Buy puts, watch what happens.
tech
I sold it when it was between $6 and $7 and had it when it was in the $1.50 range. People here didn‚Äôt like NIO back then but love it now. 


TLDR: I want a lambo, coke, and tendies

Go ask them for a meeting with the CEO
NIO looks like TSLA when it was only $390 . Everyone was talking about how "overvalued" it was, how it'll take fifteen years to reach true valuation. That's not the point. The point is stonks go up. Nio calls.
Well it wasn‚Äôt going to go down to 0
Tsla calls if you‚Äôre a patriot. Don‚Äôt let these commie EVs steal the thunder ‚ö°Ô∏è
Yeah wait till earning next week. Then we‚Äôll see who is crying
 Sorry, this pump is only for adamantium hands. If you sold during this dip don‚Äôt join us
Why isn‚Äôt NIO 50 pts ahead you might ask?
I hope man
I had never heard of them before you just mentioned. Up 2,000% this year holy shit someone must‚Äôve became a millionaire off them
Big money left. A lot of stock holders are seeing this downward trend and are hoping for a small spike to sell off. Come EOD this is gonna drop. Just my 2 cents.
SPY puts
Unintentional pun ü§£ü§£
I hope you are referencing nio brother
I made 2 bucks on a NIO put...
Told you guys to exit Nio. Downhill from here. It‚Äôs trading at a Tesla multiple and hasn‚Äôt accomplished 10% of what Tesla has done globally. Very manipulated.
The day Jim Cramer dies ironically dies by an actual bull. I will laugh my fucking ass off.
Just average down for the tendies
It's about to moon
So when does NIO hit 53 next guys? Monday?
Doesn‚Äôt matter people take off. I don‚Äôt feel like arguing with a twat
where do you work thAt you cant buy stonks
This was literally on the front page yesterday and the bears already forgot. Sad! [Lol](https://i.imgur.com/HcInVSJ.png)

It ain't over till I'm at 0

Totally get that. But for them to be within minutes of each other seems off.
I predict he kills himself or someone does it for him in 6 months time
People say that about Citron all the time
Too soon?
What happened? Got a link?
I'll be happy if it does. Let's see how it goes
Tard.  Sold for gain of $100.

Edit:  But respect for puts
How are things looking now? Did you get creamed or get out early?
Yeah its just waiting for me to sell
Fine. Take my money, and my reluctant upvote. Then probably my girlfriend next cause all I‚Äôm doing is loosing today!

Buy 20k worth of NIO $70 calls expiring on 20 November 2020. You'll most likely lose it all. But if you don't, you'll probably be a millionaire.   


TLDR; $NIO 70c 20/11.
You damn well know we‚Äôre all riding a short bus
I‚Äôm swimming in this nio dip, love the spa jets
NIO coming back up after everyone realizing Citron dude is a fraud with his own interests going against NIO. Scumbag. Hope he gets investigated for that low blow. Anyways NIO back on the rise üìà
Just yolo it can only go up from hereeeee üöÄ
Buy physical tomato paste you'll be much happier
It would have been falling so fast and with delayed quotes I would have had no idea what to put in as a limit price tbh that I likely would have gotten a very similar price. 

I think the underlying stock was at about $15.40-$15.60ish when the options were exercised.

Virgin Galactic. They have a space flight 1 week from today. It always pumps hugely when they do, and all the annalists rate it as buy right now. All my options are in this right now.
In all seriousness. Chewy is a great company. I was ordering prescription food through them for my wifes terminally ill cat (Kidney failure). A $60 box I ordered showed up the day after he passed and I called them and explained why I needed it returned. They fully refunded me. Told me to donate the food to a local shelter in his name and then sent my wife a huge bouquet of flowers. That is fucking customer service.
Why do you keep posting this you fuk

uh do you want it or something?
I‚Äôm just gonna keep dollar cost averaging down. It seems so undervalued. Nothing makes sense in this market tho.

Jack Ma pissed their leader off badly. Baba getting reckt because of it.

Thanks for giving me a discount Citron
i was up 6k on calls yesterday... down 2k today... feels bad bro
I‚Äôm using the retard strength in $FVRR today as a chance to buy cheap puts. I may be wrong on timing but this is going to be worth $0 at some point
Okay, I'm selling my entire stack of Nio shares. This is unstable. I'm still up somewhat.

They‚Äôre all at absolutely amazing buy in levels atm
Cheap to buy calls then? Should I grab some? I‚Äôm debating
SOLO avg. vol. = 7million versus 130million before noon

Hmmmmmmm
always
You‚Äôre pretty much missing everything. It‚Äôs a 3X leveraged ETF that‚Äôs the point! Do you know what the IV on calls are? Anything in the money ends up being worth a decent amount ok don‚Äôt sell a call fine. Where are you getting this make pennies shit from? Have you paid attention at all since March? We‚Äôre in a bull run and this thing is at rock bottom. Nows the time you buy it if we correct 5% you made 15%. No one thinks a 5% correction isn‚Äôt uncalled for. Only retards don‚Äôt think we can‚Äôt dip even 10% so you‚Äôre telling me 30% is pennies? It‚Äôs 3X leveraged we drop 10% you net 30% personally me I would sell an ITM call after a huge correction so I can collect fat premium and if it hits the strike I‚Äôll make even more money. If it doesn‚Äôt and the market starts to recover that‚Äôs fine too I‚Äôll buy the dip and still have a hedge as insurance.
That‚Äôs only true until you buy a call, then it always goes down
Puts time
You didnt get a proper ban complete with a serial number?
What y‚Äôall think bout tesla calls over the weekend

This sub kills everything that touches. Bunch of idiots trying to replicate somebody's massive gains after a stock is lost all its momentum. Then they run in and flood it and try and pump it only to watch all their money Robin Hood into short sellers Bank accounts.

LMAO! 12,000! You think that's a lot of cars haha. They don't sell shit dude. They don't even actually manufacture their cars either.

WSB in a nutshell - NIO, NIO, NIO, TSLA, NIO
I honestly don't think it'll drop that low, but I'll be happy if it does. I reckon it'll go sideways for a couple days after earnings and bottom out at 35. Just my 2c
Oh only $1400 for 1 call? Talk about a discount. Why not Jan? Tons of volume/open interest.
I bought 49p for .41 then sold for .45 LOL. I panic sold cuz I had to take a shit and couldn't see my TA charts. Didn't even hit my stop loss so if I had been in front of my pc I wouldn't have sold. Sooooo I'm getting a butt plug with my baby gains so next time I can just plug that shit up.
I dont think taking $300 profit is paper hands but ok
SELL NIO

They didn't "make" anything because they don't sell for profit.  It's more fun to watch it crash and post loss-porn for reddit karma than have money.

Citron fucked over so many weed companies back in 2018. that's what they do
Definitely does not sound legal. There's a whole concept of "piercing the corporate veil," where the govt can dissolve your corporation if they see you using it entirely for personal expenses. 

You're playing a *very* risky game with this strategy. My original point about charade after charade still stands.
The Citron guy is Discord CEO. Discord was the preferred chatting place for the Alt-Right. He's anti-China. Thats all there is too it. The report can be dismess as bullshit.
Get NIO calls while they‚Äôre down
I think it‚Äôs still going to move up before earnings. I think there‚Äôs too much volume everyday for it to sell off more

Should I swing LI 45c 11/20 over the weekend? Or get out with small profit today
BABA has no idea what to do anymore
[deleted]
You really think Citron is gonna kill NIO? are u serious? NIO has a lot of juice left
CRSR let‚Äôs see a rip so I can exit and chill over the weekend.
Mirin
Lol, wallstreet getting back from lunch and seeing how Citron put a discount on NIO, GG
I would start browsing escort wbesites if I was you
Waiting for the 11/20 35c I wrote against my shares to expire worthless, then watch it pop!
Fuck, again?
Dear ZM,

God damn this meme format is A+

Find a different broker.

I swear he gets dumber by the day. He can easily google the answers to those questions.
Have you heard of SOL? It‚Äôs the NIO of solar energy.
unwise to call that while its still down there
anyone else trading across five platforms to avoid dtr? I‚Äôve been doing so much better since never having to hold overnight
yup,got these 11/27 calls priced in
Ok now if BEST could never drop below 3 again then I‚Äôm Gucci.
NIO is being really squirrely right now
It is

How low are you thinking it will go post-earnings? Difficult to imagine what a post earnings dip even looks like for a stock that has basically doubled in a month‚Äîjust a correction back to 25ish?
Rip it can only go up
And lockdown talks. I don‚Äôt get it
Citron author who said to take profits on NIO was long Luckin!
SRAC warrants and wait a year or three. Hit me up afterwards and give me 3% of winnings and im gonna be rich too
wtf
I wish RH let us buy 0DTE options
Nio gonna recover and close around 48
Put?
I‚Äôm buying futures in the housing market. Hoping to take possession.
was just thinking about hopping in, they due for a run right? good earnings? no?
when will I learn not to buy puts when I think the market is tanking and to buy build a bear workshop calls instead
They did not. Constantly at 0.03 - 0.05.

It'll be back up next week i believe
Down 3k myself

SOLO YOLO?

Where do you guys look at news? YouTube news and Twitter?
thats why I have poots.
THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT INSIDER TRADING, Buy SPY $350p 11/20 if you love your mom
I thought this was the 2nd wave, we're already on the 3rd wave?
Hold the line SPY üêª
Next week is the rona death column jump
Yup, all the paper hand pussies are out now, it'll go to 60+ next week
AAPL, be nice and be green
Consider urself lucky, it's -500% for my side.
Here‚Äôs to being a millionaire by December
I understand what you mean now and I agree with you 100%. Betting against a strong upward trend requires insanely careful consideration and is generally a fools errand.
this morning was the best time to not FOMO into NIO. the second best time is now
pltr about to lift off... right?
PRPL taking off
Who‚Äôs the biggest threat to the market? Mango or Winnie the Pooh?
Whats up. Im good. Just blew up my account on that PLUG pump. U okay bro? Thanks for checking in
CHWY PT RAISED TK 90 ROOF ROOF RETARDS
Tis fuckin bullshit
Things are pumping?
I had 10$ C Jan 15, 2021 and I sold them in July now I have a bullet in my head
when is that
I bought some 1/15/2022 calls, hope to actually wipe my ass with tp by next year
>Datadog gave me 30 percent yesterday and took down 30 percent today. It hurts bros

What play would you do?
Feel like we gonna need a TeamNIO thread. I wanna see who got out and who got fried on 11/13 calls.
We‚Äôll be fine
Could it be China is getting crushed by the whuhan flu and just not saying anything? Maybe that‚Äôs why baba is dying? 

NYC mayor just said schools could close Monday if we hit 3.0 infection rate % were at 2.87
lol, downvoted because...he's right?
r/agedlikemilk
it is super illegal, put the article out at market open to by puts at the top, watch it tank to oblivion then sell. Rinse and repeat on companies with massive run-ups. Totally cool, very Legal
Because jerking off wearing 10 different women‚Äôs gloves is considered a Covid low-risk activity
Ouch üòÇ
Literally me.
Went from +2700 to +1000

Solo then back in nio
Can we end the day at 350
NIO bagholders, what's the plan? We holding out for a return to $50 next week? Or we feeling pretty fucked right now?
Think we‚Äôll see a nice runup on NIO?
Media portrayal and prosecution of T as an absolute fraud would most likely prevent someone like him ever getting into office again. Hmmm wonder if they make an example of him.
I would love to understand how PLTR is up 7% today but all the call options both in and out of the money still went down in value
lol if it wernt for citron I think I would've fomo'd into NIO today... and that would've prob been the top for now :S

Been riding NIO long calls since $6calls...I'm buying 2 houses.
Solo actually going back up Canadian EV hopefully no China issues
I sold at 29 and im waiting for a dip to buy back in
I did! Bought a $47 put at close yesterday! Sold first thing this morning for a loss of $80!
Fuuuark brah we're all gonna make it ü•∫
I don't think it'll go that low. I reckon bottom out 35-40
Sell off ain‚Äôt starting til we start getting shutdowns and trade restrictions again
Don't forget 9/11 counts of death almost every day
TY, figured it sounded to good to be true.
Smart man
were at the point where even the fed is struggling to push the market higher

that vaccine pump shouldve held, but it didnt
Yep that‚Äôs why Today was my last NIO play. We‚Äôll ride this one out... from what I‚Äôve been seeing for the past month or so, Friday‚Äôs and Monday‚Äôs are horrible days to make speculations.
I‚Äôm mad at them.. they did it on hand sanitizer, masks, swimming pools, even fucking coolers! God damn parasites on the working class
Sold WMT and JD, they keep climbing; holding NVDA HD they don't move

It hit 44 for a few seconds
[Bloomberg wrote an article about it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/herding-by-naive-robinhood-traders-may-be-good-signal-to-short)
It still dipped. Whatever the reasons.
many small plays add up to make fortune. ride small dips and cash out quick.
[deleted]
Yeah, the actual car companies are going to eat the lunch of these small EV companies.  Tesla benefitted from having great battery tech and a charismatic psycho at the helm, but these other companies have nothing.
Any dead energy companies primed for a pump?
[deleted]
If you believe today's pump, I've got an idea for a Chinese Starbucks I'll sell you some shares in
Wallstreetboy fits this meme perfectly
Hey bro are you there? Everything okay?
so nio is gonna have a huge run up right?
[removed]
I keep buying and it keeps going down. Problem is if the market overall sells off it‚Äôs going to be double fucked
You mfs really made thousands in NIO only to lose it in ONE red day
Shorts gunnna cover EOD and we going green af
I'm not letting some orange juice company take my NIO tendies away
Solo likely still has room to run fast, Nio likely to cool off first.
Is that a subreddit?
BIGC stands for Big Cunt.

Yeah the stock market has lost all structural value and integrity. Done with this shit.

Follow the trend. If it sells, panic sell. If it goes up, golden rule. STONKS only go up
This is a short squeeze and SP is going down? ü§°ü§°ü§°

CRSR gang been quiet. Whatcha guys up to?
Jk. See you Monday.
oh sorry...i thought that might be the case after i responded...but this is WSB so anything is possible haha
Spitting in woman's coffee doesn't count.
I agree two to three years behind but the demand still isn‚Äôt there right now. Evs only make up 3% of total car sales so why focus on them when the demand isn‚Äôt there yet? People have been so optimistic about evs which is the biggest driver behind these evaluations but often times that optimism falls flat on its face especially in terms of sales
It‚Äôs way lower than it was before earnings. Check the charts.
? My bae PLTR is doing great
SPY living in make believe world, ath with covid cases 150k+ a day gonna look real good for the headlines lol
[deleted]
01/2022 15c? I‚Äôve been eyeing those.
It either happens or it doesn't, so 50%, same as the odds of an option ending up in the money.
After my stonks get assigned imma go all in on pltr and nio. 2023 most likely. So yeah, I'm breaking up with you.
I‚Äôm no good at word problems
Do i just keep buying baba? Looks like its getting fucked

Has their ever been a worst time to play the market?  There are a million excuses for it to cripple your position, yet it‚Äôs impossible to time it.  Musical chairs
lol grabbed the 2023 and just forgot about it.
This is more about collective degenerate gambling than EVs but I think we all know that. Anyways, buying more calls NIO to moon!
foolish??
Lol i tried to sell this NIO 45p 11/13 at open to salvage something.  No open interest on it so i just cancelled the order and called it a loss.  Surprise surprise after i just got done detailing my car.
Where the Alt Right used to chat it up. He clearly dislikes China for personal reasons. That fucker lol
[deleted]
I was being sarcastic, it makes no sense.
Nio always gives a peek at the next week a few days early for a couple hours.
It makes sense in terms of BABA revenue. But seems like Xi is still flexing

About a tree fiddy, yeah.
lol solo already a 500MM company with nothing :S lets make this the next nkla!
Has anyone told VIX about the impending shut down? I don't think it got the memo.
No.
Olympics 2021:  Toyota unveils its solid state battery tech that will blow away the competition.  Then reality sets in that small EV companies will get dominated by the big boys in the market who have the best engineers in the world.  Toyota was supposed to showcase their solid state battery during this year's olympics, but it is already planned for production in 2025.  The EV hype is currently based on ridiculous projections and growth for 5-10 years and beyond, as if they won't have any significant competition from the likes of companies like TM who'll have vastly superior battery tech.
[deleted]
Is the worst of the dip over? Fuuuark
It's unironically going to bounce back to 52 on Monday after people forget about Citron. It's also closing at 48 today after people buy the dip
[deleted]
PALANTIR $16!!!
Got my fingers in too many holes. Can't wait for this shit to expire. Moron.
They are looking at some real estate now
Buy $18,000 worth of NIO 3 months ago. There.

**I am Not Selling.**
More Americans are currently hospitalized with Covid-19 than at any other point in the pandemic, a grim indicator that the third big wave of cases in the US may be the worst wave to date.
#bullish
Not a NIO fan boy as well. But hate seeing ppl panic sell at the lows and panic buy at the highs
JWN puts? seems a little overhyped
Should I take my $500 from pton 108c 12/04 and make a diff move for the weekend?

Bold move posting this before EOD

Dorsey looks like a homeless islamic terrorist living under a SF bridge

Because you‚Äôre retarded
Are you seriously this retarded? It ONLY dipped because of Citron whose short seller. 

Do people not see this??
Canada i think
Take your meds crazy
I have ZM 320p as my gamble play next week.
Lol good thing i sold right before this became a meme
He definitely has the look
Institutions and insiders are the majority of shareholders anyway. This is a short squeeze.
Just buy stocks or leaps. Pltr is longterm play
Both

Ty!
Can y'all remind me look at your loss porn when NIO hits 25$
I honestly dont know how what they are doing isnt super illegal
This is the way
SELL NIO SELL NIO
No one cares about your cracker jack losses
It's all good.  If QQQ doesn't gape me, then TB will.
probably gonna bottom around 25 then bounce back up to 30-35 and then slowly start climbing from there next year. if you want to diamond hand till you break even, youll most likely be holding till 2021. hype is over snd earnings wernt that great. plus with the new president only backing US based EV, they are in a bad spot now and i dont see another run in the future of 2020 for them.
my venmo is a good place to lose it (serious)
This is why it's going lower.
[HOLY SHIT, CHECK NIO TWITTER üöÄ](https://youtu.be/i8a3gjt_Ar0)

All in on SOLO or NIO?
I want one just because.

Wish I didn‚Äôt do that yesterday. Should have waited
Ccp probably hacking citron rn
Spy 370c 11/20
All in nio xpev solo.
The lunch dip was a climb. 360 at close.
Transporting it is a mere fraction of the issue, the receiving party needs to be able to store it effectively: your local pharmacy / doctor doesn't have the equipment for it. Vaccinating hundreds of millions in a span of months is simply not feasible with these vaccines.
cheap 11/27s.
Glad I didn't fall for that bull trap on NIO.
Yeah Couldn‚Äôt resist the joke lol. But yeah TBS, CNN, etc. definitely worth a look into though political spending going to go wild in that state till January
Imagine thinking earnings will only drop it 10% when it‚Äôs doubled in 6 weeks
Depends on how far out. They kept PTON down in the 20s for a few months
LMAO, I feel bad for all the dumb fucks who actually believe you. It‚Äôs like the blind leading the blind. Maybe you should google what a P/E ratio is, as well as market cap.
How much have you made so far? $3.50?
What strike and expiry?
Yep that‚Äôs why I just closed it lol
This aged well

2 words: retail dip buyers and algos 

Big money has been cash gang for a while, hence the low volume, but that doesn't keep prices from moving since there are buyers and MMs can still make money out of it
It would take the US decades to even get close to that point.  The country was built with cars in mind, not public transportation.  There is just a complete lack of infrastructure.
If we gap up my account is gone lmao
Yep, pinning wasn't good enough for them.  
Instead of letting both the calls and puts expire, they want to double dip and sell more puts in the process.
I am not selling my Zoom Puts, am down 80% 300p 11/20
Too bad I don‚Äôt know what calls and puts are. Just learned to buy/sell shares! üòÇ
December... too soon.
A lot of retail investors missed the TSLA run but they are not willing to miss these new Chinese EV run.

After all retail invertors sells, institutions will load up. 

NIO, XPEV, LI to $100 EOY üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Citron are bears who missed out on great buying opportunities and are BIG mad about it so they try and short these companies they preached were overvalued so they're poots don't expire worthless. Fuck Alex
I was sweating over some $50c's I sold around 11:30 EST to take advantage of the fucking 400% IV.  Very quickly went to 80% gain and I closed them out.
I'm so conflicted. I have a trailing limit sell but may cancel
Let me hold a few shares, I‚Äôll pay you back on the first.
i have played a bunch of regional telecom over the years. it's not a bad play, but you can get stuck holding some real stinkers.
Go to r/stocks or r/investing if you want upvotes man they would straight up beat your dick off.
So I bought five 340p 12/31 just now
You can go cash, just don‚Äôt withdraw. Do any of the fuckin retards know the difference between non taxable and taxable events?
Good luck to us my fucking Nio brother. I‚Äôm pulling for you and the rest of us.
Just liquidate it yourself and declare bankruptcy. Easy money
And you‚Äôre only up because of Citron. This wouldn‚Äôt be below 52 if that didn‚Äôt come out so what‚Äôs your rationale holding over weekend with ER Tuesday?
Short selling articles aren‚Äôt illegal dumbass. They have a disclaimer saying they have a short position in nio.
Anyone follow JAMF?
There is absolutely no way it gaps up on Monday, I swear to god this shit is just pure manipulation
All in nio and solo lotto tickets best ones tbh
When JKS blew up it lost something like 25% of its value in one day. NIO is like 15% off of its high today right now and looks to maybe be recovering. I guess we'll see whether or not it drills EOD. The Citron thing, idk what to think of it.. guess we'll see if NIO can hold strong or not.
Moderna trial results next week. Should be just as effective as the pfizer one.
Lost 200$ being greedy on nio. Rebought at 45 opinions on holding through earnings? I want my moneh bak
I remember when I sold SOLO for 6 bucks! That felt good.
the window is next week. I believe the 19-22.
[deleted]
you are all brainwashed jack dorsey is a child rapist. Thank you for listening to my ted talk.
You sound like a child. Grow up.
Not quite the same level as this. Im still a NIO fan boy but i cut my losses, and plan on coming back in
Question why did you bought solo?
Your 37.5C is below the market and your post suggest increases
The ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù in ü•≠s circle are about as factual as the ‚Äúelection fraud‚Äù cases ü•≠ has been standing behind... both are devoid of any truth

Well yes... CCP can literally make the company disappear overnight.

I bought at ipo
Citron just wants cheap calls. Don‚Äôt be fooled, buy the dip.
I got li (10c), xpev (1), NIO(7) 
Getting Ripppped in the ass right now. But they‚Äôll go up together on Monday. These Chinese ev companies play together.

I‚Äôll take my small profit before the earnings and wait for the next round
You could be right, because I honestly have no idea how we‚Äôre so green today
Well guess what you little fuck Morty. LIFE IS A FUCKING GAMBLE!!! GOTTA RISK IT ALL TO WIN BIG YOU LITTLLLEEE BIIIIIITTTTTCHH
I don't because i can't even see that as a tradeable strike
MM know something we don't. Gap up over the weekend again IMHO

Nio bottom, china buying the dip
Friendship with NIO ended. New best friend SOLO
I'd pay to see him get arrested. I'd pay even more to see him in front of a judge.
Datadog gave me 30 percent yesterday and took down 30 percent today. It hurts bros
NIO OI says it probably closes 47-48 today.

Nope. Their growth is slowing.

How is SPY even up right now? Honestly I don‚Äôt understand how could someone actually give me a valid reason why? The market has lost all fundamentals
damn low volume pump the entire day then
it does? they're all up like 5% haha
XPEV > NIO right now
PALANTIR LOOKIN BULLISH AF
More like 4 out of the original 40 I had lol. Same with Tesla but they don‚Äôt give me those sweet constellation dividend prizes.
Solo on the go-go.
Oh 100% i completely agree .If you have a quantifiable edge in mean reversion strategies so be it, but I am saying too many new traders try to step in too early when a stock is breaking out. it is all about context to be honest. I am not poo pooing mean reversion traders because i employ some setups that involve this.

 I am saying generally a problem for new traders is fighting trends when they have just started. Not everyone in retail has the advantage of scaling in/averaging in order to have a good cost basis. Therefore, they need to be more precise in their entries. 

Playing the short side definitely needs tactical precision opposed to the long side where you can be more loose on entries.
[deleted]
Yep
It's settling in a small channel. Look at the 3m. Could be next week could be next month could be never.
Hopefully SOLO will treat me better than NIO did today.
Bears make money. Bulls make money. Pigs also make money. Fuckin NIO to 100.
Can you post that report?
Just slammed off the VWAP at 44

Monday when more lockdowns announced boomer stocks go down.
Why wouldnt it? The only reason its down today is because cintron released information everyone already knew and scared people into selling

Waiting for the Bears just to declare a Jihad on NIO at this point

I want to hammer it, but baba has taken $$$$ from me this week. Ride SOLO team for the best short pump of your life!
Sentiment‚Äôs gone sour and no clear and feasible support. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. Exited every one of my NIO positions.
BABA did $100 billion in sales in 11 days and has a market cap of half a trillion. For prospective $100,000,000,000 is what Amazon makes in a year. It‚Äôs down 20% in the last month. 

When tech stops acting gay, BABA is going to be making outrageous gains. Looking like an absolute steal right now
what do you think happened to his Oct calls?

Well yeah I had it too but they have no action anymore. I guess if ev stocks go to shyte or smth Apple will get back into spotlight, but for now they‚Äôre strictly long term play, which is not for me ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Puts before ER
Glad to hear it... I stayed out as well, but they probably printed a little bit into yesterday afternoon before being absolutely worthless this morning lol
But nio puts? üòè
1.73 book value means you bought what, in Nov 2019? That‚Äôs significantly earlier than the buzz around this stock. What was it that made you see the value here or was this just a Hail Mary or part of a larger play?
I am. Bought puts on NIO and PTON this morning. Looking for NIO to dip down to 40-42 before earnings. PTON, I'm looking for a bigly drop to 80s.
Boomer stocks winning!
I‚Äôm thinking, I‚Äôd rather throw my money at something easier to predict
leave it to some guy that runs a dog sled racing team to show me

Don't even try to talk logic on Reddit. Even though WSB was it's own bubble, it will still be invaded by the morons on the main page. They are Pro Vaccines, Pro Corona virus killing the entire population, pro Biden, pro anything that's retarded. You can't reason with them. They will just gang downvote, because they can't accept facts or have a logical debate.

All I need is it to go up 20% by EoD, that's not too much to ask
lol, either way it would be gone now anyway, and maybe you'd have a (worse) coke addiction

You should write articles for millenials on how to stop being so frivolous with their money. "Drink tears, eat sand, and pay $1600 a month to live in a roach infested closet and youll be well on your way to functional poverty before you know it!"
Okay me
Sounds a lot like what retards were saying about COVID and supply lines late Jan, early Feb.
Sold for 145% profit. Should‚Äôve held longer. The option flow on your website shows someone paid $808k for NIO $43p 11/13 and $965k for NIO $44p 11/13 in the last hour. That‚Äôs some big balls to think it‚Äôs going to keep falling today. I was sweating bullets when it rose to 8% this morning haha

Oh no, I‚Äôm not looking for it to hit that low. I just don‚Äôt want to buy more when it‚Äôs +6.5% right now. If there‚Äôs a dip to 15 today, gonna snag some more. Tested 15 and came right back up.

Skepticism is good. Citron are (a bad word that reddit's prick admins won't let you say) though, the only thing that I keep in the back of my mind about $NIO, is that it's a Chinese company. Ignoring that though, fuck fundamentals, EVs are the future.
Can't have a Black Swan Event if everything is a Black Swan Event ü§î
Then, there is a partnership with Beyonc√©...so that makes it more than a bike with an iPad. 

I think the success of any workout equipment is that it needs to fit neatly under your bed. They used to say that in the ads. You get paid for the product and everybody forgets about it after one week. Money making machine.
You son of a bitch, I‚Äôm in.
Because of IV. 
If NIO is under $70 at expiry, you can keep the premium and the underlying (shares). 
If NIO closes above, then you have to deliver 500 shares and you can also keep your premium. 

If your calls get exercised, you gain more because you sold your shares at a nice profit + the premium.

Oh and some brokers aren‚Äôt correct in displaying the p/l.
it will close around 44-47 today. then premarket down to 44. Then earnings day after, dropping it to 38-42 range again. ill buy back in then.
I‚Äôm just chilling with shares for now. Trying to read/watch a lot. ty for the advice
I want to see ANYONE holding NIO puts over the weekend.

It just dropped to yesterday‚Äôs price lol, it‚Äôs really not that big of a deal
But the NIO dip now because it will never be $40 again.
Yoooo saaammmeee! Do we hold? I‚Äôm almost 60% down.
This is hardly a dip. Correction coming soon
One day spy will leave its world of make believe and return to reality. I just hope I live to see it
Why
So you thinking long puts?
I've replied to you once. And I didn't reply to what I thought was a stupid question. It has nothing to do with companies being involved in the military or not, and everything to do with politics. Remember when Trump banned Chinese Steele from Canada for national security? Read between the lines bro. Life isn't what you see in front of your face.

They don‚Äôt want to limit your options. The job hiring process can be a very grey area. Obviously they have options and if you do too, they want you to explore them. Hiring managers jobs aren‚Äôt the best to be honest. It sucks when you have to tell a great person no and see their faces wallowing in sadness. If you made it far in the interview and felt positive vibes in the end. I would be positive you secured the job. Let us know if you got it. Hoping for the best for ya

Seriously, did they announce some sort of news? It was down a little this morning that jumped.
No you get premium up front
NIO open $53 Monday
It's a weird narrative now because COVID is exploding RIGHT now, but there's vaccine news. Stay at home tickers and reopening stocks are all over the place. SPY and QQQ don't know what to do. Cruiselines are shipping out as viral petri dishes.  Inflation? Deflation? Stagflation? Who knows?

I'm up 250% and still hodling

The option value will slowly go to 0 and you will get your gains that is if it stays below 70...
Btw...I have puts on AAL and DAL...getting killed üò≠
It is
DKNG is basically flat after earnings if you consider the 3% rise AH yesterday. Why man. Why.
of course.  but if you can lose lose the amount of your investment and you can make 100% in a day on a momentum play and 1000's of percent on stupid gambles, hoepfully you stay positive over time.
Who bought NIO at the top LMFAOOOO
yep sold both at open
[deleted]
Ah.  I‚Äôll buy the fuck out of puts then.
Yeah, no big volume spikes at all, weird as hell
Don't worry bro. There are always more plays  out there. Currently there isn't anything that is a screaming buy, but I  think Tesla and Amazon are on the oversold side. Just compare to other big tech and they've sold off more since the September 1st peak. Both are due for another bull breakout imo

>all it takes is the big car manufacturers to flip a switch and now they‚Äôre making evs.

I was somewhat with you until you said this then I laughed out loud. You have no idea how difficult, risky, and expensive it is to develop an EV, set up supply chains, set up manufacturing, marketing, etc. The traditional car companies are still minimum 2-3 years behind really more like 4-5.   


Ford's new EV transit van won't even be started manufacturing until the end of 2021 and thats being optimistic. GM's EV-hummer is slated for 2022 and that's being optimistic. These companies barely have concept cars currently.  


If traditional auto makers could "flip a switch" they would be flipping it so hard right now
Dude you gotta update us. Did you sell today? Still holding? You must‚Äôve been up $400,000
Drillkings
Damn spy said fuck your puts
Don‚Äôt you get it after it expires?
Yup. Shake out the weak hands periodically so we don't have massive panic selloffs that truly kill the stock. It's still holding 45 it seems like, this shit was 40 2 days ago. Even weekly call buyers should be relatively fine, if you bought calls after several consecutive +10% days then that's kinda your own fault.

I went from +200% to +160%. Sad to see but it happens. Might go back in with more LEAPs...though 45 is still pretty damn high.
Citi bank has 46
With cities shutting down again, this makes sense.
Yes

COVID on the fucking rise!!! Rotation into travel and retarded shit ü§°
That‚Äôs some wet ass puts
They are a short company who shorted SHOP at $50.
ü§°
Simply put, it's a very niche industry and no one really has an idea on how to predict this stock's movement or how to value the company.

The other day I started calling it a luxury penny stock. It has some price it hovers around for a while and then when a potential catalyst comes along people will pile in, and then it's kept afloat by more catalysts. One those fade so does interest in having money tied up in the stock to move on to other positions that can do more work in shorter time.

Think back to the run up to $63. Eventually those holding a lot of stocks probably thought 'well now what? ESPN deal news more than bought up, little boosts like deals with NFL teams priced in, NFL season doing fine and priced in.....'. No way to predict whether $63 is fair, so best take the money out and put it elsewhere. Especially consider the timing -- leading into October with a lot of tech news/earnings after the September beatings. Why hold DKNG when you can hold tech.

So, it gets pump and dump status when a catalyst like earnings comes along. I think DKNG is great for the long term, but I wouldn't count on good news for DKNG to have staying power in the stock's valuation.
JD 95 EOD lets go
Just fucking die already, let one side win
No, I'm a seasoned veteran trader of 3 weeks and I'm holding, shit would have been in the sky right now if stupid gay ass citron shut up. Also Nio will smack citron across the face with a fat cock on earnings believe me

I hope you bought your puts at the lake and not just now
Yea no problem. So it‚Äôs best to buy in the afternoon and sell in the next morning because of implied volatility is greater in the morning. Nobody is going to be buying calls in the middle of the day when the stock price peaks.
Well finish green EOD no doubt.
Maybe a little if it were real
100% correct, I sold 68 put contracts at the top (52 strike) but I'm not concerned b/c it is exactly as you said.

First, to crush the calls; then sell puts before letting the stock go up.  
It is not coincidence this happened right before earnings.
Solo leaps?
Ugh... was so happy this morning, but still up a lot overall ... happy but not as much haha

Who is that citron guy? Fuck him
FSR is a pump and dump. FSR needs to fix their image.
it appears as though travel stocks were the play today...
AYRO is about to pop off. The next NIO if u will. Get them tendies while they got my fellow retards!!!
what is our next hype Gina stock?
yeah thanks.  several other people have chimed in with long term BABA confidence.  have to just stop freaking out watching BABA go sideways while JD, pinduduo etc all go up.  BABA long term does have lots of good shit going on especially cloud computing now.
Supposedly a test flight between November 19 and 23. Buy calls.

You must be new here. Wsb has always been this retarded.
Buy high, sell low. This is the way.
Citron is the new Hindenburg
for real. im still up a nice 170%, i mean it was 270% earlier but still. lol. only the retards who fomo'd into it today got rekt
Let‚Äôs be honest. 

You are literally brain dead if you sold based off of a notorious short sellers ‚Äúreport.‚Äù
I bought 100 at $2 as well but I still have mine. Alternate timeline you is happy about it.
[deleted]
Because it‚Äôs down 7% today
buy the nio dip, it will be 50$ next week after earnings.
We got all next week brother, especially Monday and Tuesday
I belive the earnjngs report for NIO is already priced in so bag holders are screwed
I need NIO to get to 48 and I‚Äôll be really poor kid rich today. Letsgooo $500 yolo
Damn. People lost fortunes today . YIKES
This right here
Fuck it loading up on spy puts
I‚Äôve been trying something similar to Japanese flash, I like
Theres still a morgan stanley $42 price target
It literally dropped to yesterday‚Äôs price, how is that bad?
AAPL and TSLA are both being a peice of shit
Can't wait for nio to be done. Let's talk about something interesting
now from the top, make it drop
Yooooo same here dude. What strike price? I haven‚Äôt met anyone on this sub doing selling puts.
Citron browses this message board and will write a hit piece on the most pumped stocks here. Fucking morons
[deleted]
When you say car companies can make EV at the flip of a switch... you obviously dont know what you're talking about.
This is the way
I think you have no idea why NIO bulls are still in right now

Damn! We bout to lisp our way into tendies boiz...let's see how well chicken prints....
diamond handed LI auto from 39.05 all the way down to 35.84 before i finally pulled the plug and sold. fuck me, all that profit from nio yesterday and more is gone. fucking gay shit.
now from the top, make it drop
Today is my reason.
Glad i took profits on Nio and rebought puts.. will sell these puts today and rebuy calls on monday for nice run up to earnings
man what happened to BABA is so sad. BABA is like that old sage tree in the forest keeping everything and everyone together silently. They are cutting down BABA

idk why he doesnt have his own hagdge fond
True.  $100 by next summer.  Needed to slow down a little
Lower highs, lower lows, high momentum.  NIO guys might wanna run lol.
So obvious big money has tesla propped up  but they're not budging.  Very annoying
They‚Äôre striking big deals and it‚Äôs all in the potential, they‚Äôre gonna be a really solid number going forward.
Oops
A real clown working a birthday party for 30min is making 500% more this this clown typing this right now.
I've never bought puts in my life, but this is too real to pass off. Does that make me a bobo!? Btw, I hope everyone here who bought Nio calls become bankrupt. Just like communists, they can starve because if their stupidity.
Bullish!

Hey man appreciate the post ! You got any tickers? I might add some long term holds
Was about to cry from my 30k loss.. saw this guy commented on his 79k NIO loss.. LOL
For real, my BABA position is shitting the bed
lmao bought NIO 39.5/39p credit spreads exp next week when it was at $50 this morning. You hate to see it. Hopefully IV crush makes it worth less post-earnings

Hi Elon
Anyone with calls expiring tomorrow.  Anyone with next Friday is fine as long as they didn't buy it today
Is NIO IV always this high?
Hahahahaha fuck where‚Äôd my money go
I literally sold, checked wsb and saw posts about a dip, went back and looked and it was at 47
Taking a break from WSB until 95% of posts are aren't about NIO. Fuck this
Oh shit are we rebounding a little or what
This NIO dip is just to crush calls and create bearish sentiment, more retards buy puts and then price goes up.
ZM what is u doing bb
Shut up and take my upvotes, all outta money
Friendship ended with NIO

Now FSR is my best friend
It‚Äôs 1000 because of corona
With all the fund managers that were cheering it before the ANT ipo was torpedoed you gotta believe institutional buyers are salivating right now.  It‚Äôs been one of the most shorted stocks since then but I‚Äôm expecting a squeeze when those positions close.
Waiting for a dip and buying more. Picked up another 200 shares this morning
Damn...shoulda known!

NIO haters are just mad they didn't get free money.
That being said I'm a little hesitant about NIO now. I feel like our time on this train is running short you know? We've been getting away with too much profit...
Never even heard of Citron before today
i  agree with you so much.
redditors in shambles when the ‚Äúbuy at the top‚Äù strategy does not pay off
GUH
What is this about? You guys guessing Trump will try to tank the economy to spite biden just before his presidency by putting heavy sanctions on China?
NOK pattern setup looks good. Just wait and this will be the new NIO. As long as you set the expiration date far in future. It's quite slow. 5G is the future.
Yeah but doesn't he own like TNT etc, nationwide stations. I'm talking the regional networks - like Sinclair, Gannett, etc
Sold at open, gains are gains!
my retarded ass is gonna need a miracle here
Drift King?
I bought puts at open, then calls at the dips with stop losses. I am up everywhere. I did lost out on CSCO puts and PLTR puts =( so this makes up for it.
I wanna know what free stock you got

Fancy Nancy no likey
DKNG is the biggest piece of shit ever.
Call still up 86% lmfao. If you actually played NIO smart you shouldn‚Äôt be losing money. Only FOMO pigs getting slaughtered
This is the truth
Hope they sold
Indeed
I can't argue against it
Brother hold on. We will be back in no time.
I sold 68 put contracts this morning at the top 52 strike.  
Dunno how long I'll be bag holding, but I'll need NIO to do well on their earnings call.

Let‚Äôs be honest, if you bought NIO at open today (or near close yesterday) you are literally braindead
And the future will need companies like PLTR way more than ever, such a immense amount of data to process nowadays.
yeah for real. early 20s was the best time of my life. granted I was a few k in credit card debt from the yoloing but now im 32 and paid everything off. no regrets man.
It got out of hand quick. It's just a bunch of college fuck ups at this point. Wall street fucking bets is gone
Angry kid lost his savings on NIO and downvoting everyone lmao. UPVOTES FOR EVERYONE
a lot of them got IV crushed
Yep. Ex- distribution date is 17th.
>Hang on man. I never said there wasn't going to be a crash. And I think that's what people have been jumping on. Folks accusing me of saying, "This time its different" somehow are implying that I'm implying the market is forever buoyant. 

That and the amount of credit you're giving to retail influence.  Yeah they may move a bankrupt stock that no one else wants to touch, and with options that leverage might force a low float stock upward, but they're not going to be keeping the market up on their own.  

They're along for whatever ride the market takes them on, and will eventually lose their money if they keep making the dumb amateur plays they have been.

You basically just ignored the first two paragraphs in my original post where I told you exactly why the market went down and up so fast, and it has nothing to do with everyone having $100 in a trading app in their pocket. And the transactions they provide are inconsequential for the most part, unless you're trading really stupid stocks.
NIO wake up bb. Thank you

Fisker so sexy right now
I mean, I am a NIO bull but profit is profit my dude, good stuff
You have to buy in to one of the chinese in order to get Chinas backing on your extremely profitable company.
If you seriously think NIO is going to $100, this pull back is actually healthy.
Same. I think I actually have a real problem, might have to stop trading for a year or so

Please tesla die to 380
the market is in taking mode 95% of the time and it is only in giving mode maybe 5% of the time. it is in that 5% of time where we make our money as traders. Man I can't tell you how much money overtrading has cost me and I am still plagued by it even NOW! It is a constant fight.
Just bought the dip nio 50c 11/20.
DKNG consistently letting me down, but I keep going back to it. What have I become.
We find a way
thanks this gives me some cummies in my undies. Good to hear that someone out there (even if autistic) believes this is short term panic and it'll go up another 400% in a day or two.
This morning at Market open I chuckled at this comment. Now I'm back just to see some of the new stuff. Got a second chuckle with your edit.
Wait so you think I should sell my calls?
bro he's bearish on NIO, yes what you said is true, can that justify NIO's price when yesterday it briefly overtook daimler and became #5 in global auto market cap ranking? market is forward looking, but they better like sell cars in the entire world really fast to live up to the expectations they have been getting. b4 people use the "chinese market" is like a world of it's own, all these other auto makers also sell cars in China in case anybody didn't know.

Imagine buying NIO at the top!
I‚Äôll try again on Monday
The market valuation is still under 300M. You have the advantage of it being a niche product with lots of uses outside of standard EVs. 

Thing is built with a minimal approach to limit cost and manufacture time and they have new models being rolled out for delivery. 

Doesn‚Äôt need to hit that hard to return value on its current valuation. 

Concerns are around extreme volatility right now. This stock gets blown around like a leaf in a hurricane so you need diamond hands and a clear plan. 

Lots of potential positive catalysts upcoming and experienced board. I took profits in the low 4s on part of my hold and mid 6s for the rest. Waiting for it to drop to buy back in.
because stonks

NIO is still above where it opened 24hrs ago and people are at 50+% losses?  How in the actual fuck is that even possible unless you are literally just reading this thread blindly submitting market buys on each comment
Wow jealous.
Fuck your downvote train, around here we only have gold trains

Explain why though. This is me anytime I see something go parabolic and i‚Äôm right more than wrong
!Remind me 72 hours
yea i sold all, but i bought in at 41. i didnt want to sell, but i think after earnings dip i could get in around the same price... worst case i buy in at 50.
DUMP EET
I don‚Äôt even have a play in NIO, but I have observed that every Friday it consolidates and the bears come out and say it‚Äôs dead and dance around its corpse only for it to go up another $5 the next week.
Listen up 20 year old. Snort as much coke and fuck as many hookers as you can and get it out of your system. You dont wanna be a 40 year old sucking on your wife's saggy tits with teenagers wondering. Enjoy life while you can.

That reminds me of something very astute I've recently heard on a podcast. People always ask "how do I get this job" instead of "how do I get really good at this". Once you're really good, the job usually follows. Similar sentiment which I totally get behind
PLTR is a very important company. There's an immense amount of data to process these days and they have top data scientists working for the government and corporations. Bought 700 shares today.

Yeah, I'm with you.  Definitely never putting any major money into sketchy chinese shit with accounting issues and government interference at anytime.

I‚Äôm sure your one of many
It‚Äôs priced on growth potential you moron.

When NIO expands its sales from $500M to $38B then we can then apply boomer valuations to it and it‚Äôs market cap can return to $30B. 

In the meantime we‚Äôre using autismo valuation method which means if there‚Äôs a high volume of memes being made on the stock it will continue to go up. Under this valuation method, NIO can be worth 10x the value of Ford as long as the meme production value holds above 100x of Ford.

I know everyone hated hearing this a couple days ago, but I‚Äôll say it again. For a stock that is up 100% in one month alone, this is natural and necessary for the stock to stay on track for healthy sustainable growth. I own almost 1,000 shares in Nio. A red day is upsetting, sure, but have some faith and buy the dip Monday morning lol. Chill.

While this guy is a F A G for buying shares you have to admit that if he did buy options he would have likely sold long ago. When NIO was under $2 a share I think the furthest strike price available was like $10.

Only thing worse than EV shills are people who rush in here after to stomp on their corpse. Stfu we know its overvalued
Youre kinda right though i doubt anybody other than a single guy in a big city would buy
Time to get in this NKLA dip before the second leg up and then big squeeze higher.

On a Friday going into the weekend? No, not a chance.
if NIO breaks 44 its free fall
Lol
What kind of retard posts a picture of a picture?
GAY nio bulls downvote me please

Nio won‚Äôt end above 45 children. You should know the way Big money works by now. They will fuck your calls
Cincinnati Financial declares $0.60 dividend????? Buy b4 the 14th or dont trust the company?
Go for both. Diversify or some shit
Solo holding well actually
Lol short selling research is so hilarious. "Hey guys we are losing money because you keep buying. This company bad. Please sell so we get our tendies back"
So did $47
So sell Monday?
China EV bubble popping. U guys think an EV switch happens over a week? Talk about fomo. Long dated calls will save u
With all the EV hype in here is anybody playing KCAC?  Up 18% today.
Hell no
It's going to 25over the next couple of weeks
[removed]
Sprite & Aleve. Also edibles.
Yeah, guess I'm a boomer with only shares and leaps. Might load up more on the dip once it consolidates.

Tempted to sell condors pre earnings but that's probably too risky.
FSR don't give a fuck about Chinese EV stonks
No prob
F. You good?
Knowing how fridays go it‚Äôll skyrocket then dump eod
When is NKLA just gonna shrivel and die
Should have bought them yesterday afternoon or this morning, but now is probably fine too
All you NIO people, when BYND was bubbling it had 12-15% drop. Then ripped up even higher.
Nio is down because it's not normal for a stock to jump up 30% in one week. Especially one for a company that has yet to turn a profit

Hold it will be up next week
make PLTR the new NIO
And here come the downvote losers
where you think it is?
haha, no, no one buys their cars.
Sold NIO at 45. Bought back in at 46. This is the way
Lol valid point. All they do is get one news article to pump up a stock then when they wanna cash out they get another to sabotage it
Damage is done.  Party time.
Send vids, my masturbation sessions haven't been good for a while. Time for a change
Why do you think KNDI will go up?
Citron owns NIO puts before they published that hit piece. I guarantee it.
$45 seems like fair support.
Jack ma in trouble, don‚Äôt expect baba to recover anytime soon
Remember the good old days? Like when I was up 54% for 5 minutes with SOLO this morning? Shit was tight.
Bought some QQQ 285c Dec earlier this morning. I am up $6 so far. Let's go!!
Whats the top on SPY today?
Imagine replying to the wrong comment retard

Hey Alexa play fury of the storm by dragon force

Great - haven't screened those before.  Appreciate the heads-up!
I was told there would be a dump
Calls on Brunswick Boats, Polaris ATVs and Snowmobiles
Cmon Aapl where are your 5% days from the past, such a slow mover
Yeah, BABA isn't coming back until the Chinese regulators are done running train on Jack Ma's ass.  Then they'll throw his bloodied, cumstained ass out on the street for everyone to see.  There's too much fear right now that another Chinese government retribution shot could be taken.  Maybe in a few weeks you might see some forgiveness and the stock will get its mojo back.
No, i have to watch the man that gave me a childhood of suffering. Father, from this day forward, i abandon this cursed name you bestowed upon me. May we meet in depths of Cocytus.
Can Nio and pltr get their own threads? We get it, you are all sheep and want everyone to know how with it you are!
Your probably fine. Sell as soon as possible
Sad sad story
Also cars generally are expensive AF in China due to tariffs especially for luxury autos. So $65k is pretty much a bargain if you're in the market for a 3 series BMW in China. It's only because EVs are not hit with tariffs that they really out compete.
Spy calls for next week or NIO puts for next week???? What‚Äôs the play
Hope so
And 70% of Americans have less than $1000 in savings.
I dumped mine I bought at $36

Yeah bro have fun
I would get in in. SOLO it looks like it's stabilized and I can see it jumping again on Monday or maybe even EOD

How would a rise in interest rates affect XLF? Higher interest rates -> higher bottom line for lenders?

Yeah wait a day and you can get them even lower
Why does someone come in here everyday and downvote every comment?
NIOs price is pretty much yesterday's. Relax
Luckin was a legit company that sold coffee that people buy
Also I feel like a lot of people who are trying to shit on nio don‚Äôt understand how fucked China is environmentally and how quickly they realize they need to reverse all that industrial pumping
That's funny this lady sold CVX this week - so did I.
Up 100% on NiO puts and 50% on ZTO calls, the ups of China
that's the day i'll shit my pants
well done, my dude

I somehow managed to miss this whole NIO thing and at this point I'm afraid to ask
ü§¢ü§¢ü§Æü§Æü§Æ NIO is about to get my ass margin called
Yeah, I‚Äôm planning on selling before but I hope we see a good runup
I bought the dip 2 hours ago. We on the same page
If you think about it, if nkla can get to 20, surely solo can too. Before we were obsessed with Tesla, now we have a few more ev stocks to obsess about. Why would we stop? It‚Äôs not like apple and co is rocking anymore
Citron report came out 2 minutes after I bought my last batch of NIO.
Everyone you fuck
True, trading on emotion is guaranteed to lose. What I find with events like corona and election is that so many smart people lose trying to actively time it, when they could have just left it and be fine.
[removed]
Like a phoenix we will rise from the ashes!!!!!!!
I sold off everything BABA (except for a $300c for next week) because I think the CCP is going to hamstring Jack Ma as much as they can.  He dissed the party.
Ya
RemindMe! 3 months
His virginity?
Bro who cares about what people are selling now. We‚Äôre speculative bitch.
It def doesn't look great, but I see a small argument where there is some support at $258. If it breaks that though, ya $240 looks likely to me. With how oversold it is though it could get a bounce if it does find some support here.
Your mom should have swallowed more we‚Äôd have less pussies around

Tell me why I should buy this NIO dip for a face ripper on Monday
What‚Äôs your plan now?

If nio should be 25$ then fisker should be under a dollar. Jesus
Looks like share gang won again
bruh you been sleeping all week or what
Earnings, books, market share, govt.. all of it.
don't do it, leave this place.
Monday üöÄüöÄ earnings gonna be good
RIP China.
Now
Bro... holding for years. This is a long term hold. Buy shares, don‚Äôt play weeklies.
I could have but not now, it seems too risky now.
When it is at 25
Really ? I think it will go 1 month easy with that phase
because everyone else was
$23c for 1/15/21 LETS GOOOOO
No were adjusting to next week 60 cause of gay news buy calls it‚Äôs dipped hard
I bought my puts back right at market open
So I should definitely hold these puts through the weekend haha
Change your chart to 5min intraday and view it as a 1 day chart. I'm using tos but you should have it on any broker. It starts around 1050 eastern time
Bought a nio put, bottom is in.
lol 0dte FD calls on NIO? free money? for Earnings people to fomo?
Downvotes Incoming watch üòÇ
NIO BTFD NOW
Pretty sure a lot of people are buying NIO because it's pronounced like Neo and as we all know, Neo is The One. This is WSB after all.
Downvoting won‚Äôt bring back your -99% portfolio my friends, but if it helps...
hows that NIO working out for ya retards? bought puts this morning at 50... it's had its run and is now done for a while...
[deleted]
If I have shares in Nio, XPEV, and Li bought at fairly good prices ($37, $33, $28) I should hold right?
much better quality too, my dream car now is the et9. Looks like a storm trooper.
this is the way
Made 40% profit on NIO 28p.  LOL thanks for the free money that has no chance of paying off.

I remember when I owned SHOP at $145. I was young and sold at $125 when it dropped after the Citron report. It‚Äôs at like $1000 now. I‚Äôve learned my lesson.
 üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ
Well did you sell right at that second? Because going by the time that was pretty much the exact point where it peaked.
[removed]
Because the CCP
420:69 split
I had sworn to hold NIO until earnings, but chickened out when I was even for the day. Glad I did, but I am ready to jump in big time if it pumps again.
Citron is a terrible short company. They shorted Shopify at 50.
I restarted it and the update went through fine - think it was just a temp glitch unlike Chrome
This bear making MAD GUAP as we speak off you fearful lil  NIO cucks ESKEEETIIIIT
38 (maybe)

I‚Äôm holding my 354P 11/18 over the weekending. 350 could be a little iffy though
[removed]
This didn't age well
You guys should realize that this dump is to crush calls, and generate bearish sentiment to sell puts to you idiots, so that they can then push it back up and crush your puts. The MMs like to have their cake and eat it too.

Literally some of the best DD posted here in a while üöÄ
No stop loss?
this is the nio dip u have been looking for.  

buy the dip f******ot.
when will people learn
no, just a high risk high reward play right now.  most of the easy money is made.  this thing could easily go to 60 or 80 or it could go sideways and then calls eat shit.
I bought just 100$ of them in July and they keep going. I just regret that I didn't buy more.
game changer
Your moms a hoe
This is the only reason anyone even knows what this company is
Nio has a lot more gain on the downside. Don't get caught buying the dip
shut up bitch

think we should submit a SEC complaint to make sure their trades didn't correlate with the article ie. Short -> \*release article -> Cover
The dip bought you
is it at 60 yet? i keep seeing 45 on my screen but maybe thats for a half share or something?
Yeah I‚Äôll probably leave it as is, trying to time options is stressful enough
Why has baba been going down so much over the week, seems like a good buy
Well I sold spreads 350/349. Very high pop. I would sell if I were you
Words to live by. Godspeed.
Nio ride was fun while it lasted. Sold my 20c leaps for a 250% profit.
This shit is just getting started, pussy
That's scary
[deleted]
I think it would cause some pullback but the fear factor isn't there like it was before. If anything I would just hope it causes a broad drop and pick up some cheap positions , timing the puts would be too tricky imo
We‚Äôre you in NIO

They knew what they were doing
"Now"? Lol
How?!?
When the fuck do we go in on NIO?
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/palantir-analysts-largely-positive-on-first-earnings-report-as-public-company

Jeffries : up to 18$ from 13
RBC Capital Markets: up to 15$ from 11
Morgan Stanley: up to 15$ from 13
can i get some pics for later?
Except NIO is a legit company,  with cars,  that people buy.
[deleted]
didn't age well
You talking earnings or what
Damn man. Fuck the $20k (130%) I‚Äôm up today on NIO puts. It feels much better to be right. Been warning all you retards 10 times a day of over valuation based on XPEV. But. No one listens.

NIO 35 on Tuesday. For the 302nd time

My stomach is doing flips at the thought of this.
NIO bulls going to panic sell, bears going to load on puts, ER is going to beat and retail is going to be left broken and bloodied while MMs rake in $
Tesla staying flat for the S&P inclusion
I guarantee they don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about WSB.
LMFAO at this clown market.  Imagine pumping SOLO to ride this temporary EV trend, and being completely delusional to think something like this will actually sell:

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2t2pv9Ky7E/maxresdefault.jpg

This is like back when the fanboys were adamant and convinced beyond a doubt that something as fucking stupid as google glass would sell and be a wild hit.  People love losing money on mindlessly stupid herd mentality plays.

Funny thing is, I actually bought TSLA at open today and it's already down 2%

The market is some real BULL SHIT.  Why Tesla got to be down cause daddy musk test both + and -.  This make no damn sense
Don‚Äôt worry Nio boys, time to grab this falling knife üòéüòé
Citron releases a gay as fuck article to tank prices to $45 so they can buy in and ride the tendie short bus on Monday when it green dildos to $60
You'll be safe. Look at that bounce off 44. Strong support there.
Could‚Äôve sold that NIO at ath today. No worries though I‚Äôm down today but ready to hold through next week cuz it‚Äôs going to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Once again, I‚Äôm so fucking stupid. Bought a NIO 0dte, within minutes it was +80%, didn‚Äôt sell and now sitting at -70%
Isn't it obvious? Calls on tendies
I'm loaded to the fucking gills on puts. I anticipate this entire month of gains to be wiped out.
Other way around
Someone please show me some loss porn?
353 SPY puts expiring monday
Reminds me of that time back in '18 when Micron stopped going up. An entire generation of WSB'ers got wiped out.
$79K to $0 just like that
where my PLTR gang gang? Are we holding over the weekend!
Run at a macd, that dump was clear as day ‚òÄÔ∏è
NIO went for maximum pain
I thought I bought the dip at 47.5

I‚Äôm going back in on calls for nio
Really wish my money haven't settled today
Someone bought NIO at the top, please know everything will be okay. Don‚Äôt do anything stupid
short seller report released on a friday with earnings a few days away.. hmm..
Nio Rsi is 41 jajajjjajaja. Overbought piece of shit die and make me money
You buying calls sir?
WSB culling. I hardly knew ya
Just need NIO hit 35 for my buy limit
NIO calls time?
Probably a good idea to do some reading on investopedia.com or something to understand what you're doing. A $10 quickie can easily turn into YOLOing all in.
No, we are all retarded
I do. They are.

I managed to make 600 on NIO calls today. Bought 5 big shares of AAPL with my sweet gainz
heard.  just put in a t-stop.
Tuesday
you know, you just might be right. Thanks
I wanna do a day trade for spy calls what should I do??
Usually when a stock goes parabolic the 50 day sma is its floor. $26 puts might print üòÇ on nio
Damn, it must be so nice to just write an article that says, "they barely sell any cars!" and get a stock to immediately tank 20%.
You guys are really dumb. How do you not see there‚Äôs an ev bubble. ‚ÄúChina is switching to all electric‚Äù ‚Äúthey‚Äôre the cars of the future‚Äù is some of the stupid shit I‚Äôve been hearing meanwhile the largest car companies in the world, that make and sell a tens/hundreds of times more cars (of the present) aren‚Äôt worth as much.

Unpopular opinion but if nio should be 25$ then fisker should be $0.75 cents, fuckin joke. Not even a dollar will be made until 2022, but we‚Äôre supposed to hop in that steaming pile of shit
I feel like they are gonna funnel back to TSLA next week finally, thoughts?
Ok and how
Do you sell it or cancel to make the profits?
Agree
11/20 $25p‚Äôs are the play for NIO. Hop on

Alexa play free falling
Mad cuz bad
Oh I‚Äôm ready to catch this NIO knife
Put your money where your mouth is brah
Fuck you Citron
This doesn‚Äôt feel right
Because short-selling is too obvious of a move and the market moving institutions know it.
Dude they make 3 wheeled cars, i aint going in on mr bean vehicles.
Well I see support at 38 but idk if it‚Äôll hold
I chose a good morning to make my first NIO bear play :D
Energy peeps?
XLE üöÄ
What's the point of getting back a few pennies?
Imagine selling your NIO 0DTE  44p for an 80% loss this morning? Couldn‚Äôt be me
üôèüèæüôèüèæ
Unsurprisingly, comment on this article in WSJ has not been enabled.
NIO CEO SAID THE N WORD ON CAMERA
NIO was already starting to downtrend before citron published their article. If you bought 0dte calls at 50$ discipline your FOMO
I got the 42c around the same dio and sold it a while after it reached 45 or something lol. Shit went through the roof after that. Took 30% profit. Bought 42p yesterday at the top
Damn I should've inverse you NIO cucks earlier, hope.I still catch some mini tendies.
Oh fuck
Pretty much. Avg price of $49.75.
Ah I see.... basically a lucky gamble.
Also, nio is based and headquartered out of Shanghai
Doubt
I‚Äôve heard there were people making 10k a year just shuffling money around getting the bonus for new bank accounts in /r/churning

But I guess post COVID it‚Äôs probably tougher
If you're up, prob get out. Tech might rally and push, but it also might crash first before it does. You're in high risk territory right now.
Tesla took years to get into the black, and they didn't have China backing them.
Rip to the NIO dip buyers
Whenever I start to think I'm smart, I just tell myself, wait 20 minutes.  Good reality check tends to follow.
Damn but if you got nio puts y‚Äôall printing
Nio's price action reminds me of Luckin and we all know how that ended
I love it, gets an upgrade IMMEDIATELY dies. Wtf
Watch 42.5 for a Nio bounce imo
I say this and Im not even playing it... always inverse fomo
That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works
Who has two thumbs and sold the low, as specified on Robinhood, for the NIO 41.50 put.... this guy.ü§¨
You mean 43?
Probably because they bought NIO calls this morning and lost their house
Wwfff Li auto +22% to 0%

FOMO'ed back into CVS after selling yesterday afternoon. Who'd have thought it would rocket above the weekly high before noon? Plan was to let the flat/selling pattern continue and buy back into my original position today or early next week. Turned 6k into 35k so a great hit but the same position would be > 50k right now.

The NIO pumping cock sucking crew always has to ruin it for everyone.
When your nio puts printing more than the calls losing
Lemme guess.. bought NIO at top?
Financial institutions must have some sort of bot monitoring all of WSB, counting each time we talk about a ticker 

Once that number hits a threshold, they release a hit piece or just mass sell
Everyone asking about NIO wait until Monday. These weekends have all been wild as far as news and shit it‚Äôs not safe anymore to bag hold over the weekend now that this game is rigged by the elite. Wait till Monday low then ride it through ER
What's wrong with the Stocks app on iPhone? It's been freezing up for the last 2 days now.
So happy i sold you retards NIO calls this morning

Nio will find a bottom going to drop big $$ if this happens and it goes full send today
Good meme ass man
Honestly the sad thing is a lot of these people are probably really smart, smarter than I to be frank. As humans we are naturally hard wired to be poor traders. As traders we  want to step in and fight trends so that we can then say that we picked the bottom or the top, but to be honest this is not realistic. We don't have to play hero in order to make money in this game. You need a strict set of rules and discipline (risk management) to make it.
The nio cash covered 43 put I sold at 9:59 is up 180%..
Thanks - appreciate the help.  Taking a look a CNR, but it looks expensive.  Bad personal experiences with CIBC, but maybe that's just me.  I like TD too.  Kinaxis is a new one to me - need to take a look

LOLOL
And lose more
I mean, BABA is. It has some political risk with Xi though that might negate technicals.
Lol gains evaporating
The real winner (besides the consumer) is TSMC who has contracts to make all of these chips
think I missed the entry on NIO puts :( 0dte would've been $$$$
Sooooo how low is nio going today?
Maybe, maybe not, bulls will use earnings as an excuse to pump it - despite what citron says. You‚Äôll be safe.
How‚Äôs it still green?
Well it was up 45% today and I didn‚Äôt sell my sweet sweet weekly calls ü§£
But yes I think it will. I do have pretty cheap March 2021 calls on SOLO

On Nio I have puts as I personally think it‚Äôs overpriced and will fall

But then what do I know I‚Äôm 20% down today thanks to PTON BABA
Imagine expecting nio to keep on going up before the big dogs cash out profits.. remember, we only eat crumbs
When President Xi pulls out of Jack Ma's ass and finishes all over his face and Jack Ma says thank you sir may I have another.  People are going to fear at any time another fuck u move from the Chinese government could come continuing to make an example of Ali Baba and Jack Ma.

Imagine having NIO puts and selling them this morning when NIO was up bigly. I‚Äôd be kicking myself hard
Wait till earnings
STOP THE COUNT!
I accidentally bought $4000 in calls cause I put in 200 instead of 20. And I also can‚Äôt sell them today cause I‚Äôll get PDT restrictions. Basically just gotta hold them over the weekend and hope I don‚Äôt get absolutely fucked Monday. Or maybe I just take the ban?
Wait for eod

I am so unbelievably fucked.
Weed getting lifted again
Just the premium
Ok, thanks, i also sold some today after the drop, but my expiry is not until 27th and some into 18th of December. I also actually think that the liftoff NIO had from XPEV and LI earnings (which both were beyond overexaggerated anyway), will not carry forward into NIO earnings and will be more of a sell the news event. After the earnings (hopefully) sell off, i will get back in somewhere in the low 30s. Good luck!

Bought NIO puts yesterday. Thank fuckin god. Hold through earnings? It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve made any actual money sooo

Lose money because I‚Äôm a retard.
Make money because I‚Äôm a lucky retard.
It was way too high honestly. It needed a trim
Whoever bought nio at 54 may god have mercy
I hope NIO crashes and burns. Back in late June early July NIO was getting a lot of hype in WSB and I YOLOd into NIO calls that were somewhat deep ITM, dated 7 weeks out, thought I was being smart. Overnight one day when all other stocks were green NIO bombed & I went down 85%. I held until expiration waiting for the rebound and watched my 85% loss climb to 100%. All the shithead NIO bulls went into hiding just to reemerge a week after my calls expired and this present run started. NIO is overbought, highly volatile, and it's constantly being manipulated. I've crawled back to only 50% down for my all time but I could never bring myself to be bullish on that POS again FUCK NIO
Fuck üçé. I‚Äôll my bros eat üçë

Yeah, right. I bought this morning and it‚Äôs taking hard. Fuckin your bitch asses for the pump and dump
Suck a dick soyboy anyone stupid enough buying Nio after a 1000% run in less than a year deserves to lose money
Only if its earnings are good.
BABA isn't getting support until Jack Ma bends over and literally lets President Xi fuck him in the ass in front of the Chinese people.  He FUCKED UP big time.  Seriously until there is public sign of forgiveness by Xi and the Chinese government people are going to stay away from this like its a barrel of rotten fish.  Ass fucked twice in 2 weeks...  people are going to fear that at any moment another fuck u move could happen.  So many people thought they were going to get rich on BABA this month and leveraged and got wiped.
Y‚Äôall need to quit bugging on NIO. It‚Äôs a weekend sell off, happens every Friday. It will rally again starting either EOD today or next week. 

This shit going to moon until earnings, then drop, then rally again.
Calculated YOLO plays
If moderna annouces successful vaccine data like pfizer did then you will absolutely be right. That data is coming in the next week or 2. It was submitted for analysis yesterday.
the best thing about having bought AAPL shares many years ago is that i always have a well to dip into every time my account goes into a deficit or i'm in a margin call because i'm such a shit trader
How the fuck do people keep chasing shit like nio when it's clearly overbought. I'll never get it.
Sounds like you‚Äôre gonna cry? You okay?
Imagine putting a bearish article with a big red siren on everyone‚Äôs trading app, getting to tank a stock, and buy up all the cheap calls while selling your puts that were about to get raped.
Soooo you think 2,300% is sustainable? Not even Telsa could do that after 5 years.
u talm bout nio? u think only one put to multiple calls is really ample protection?
What % of your portfolio?

To add to this...Jay Leno is one of the most well known gear heads with his massive car collection, when he was asked about EV's future...he thinks the EV will be the new switch...like the car from the horse & buggy. Before cars...the stench of horse shit was everywhere in New York city...when cars came, the horse shit went away and the air became cleaner. Leno believes that with more EV's on the road, other gear heads like himself won't have to worry so much about running out of gas to keep their hobby going.

There's a 15 min block for NIO where ~17M shares were mainly sold for 10 min and then mainly bought for the last 5min. Coincidence? I don't think Citron is the real culprit here. Someone big needed a dip to get in. My humble conspiracy theory for today lol
5x FEAC $20 calls for 2/18/21
You just witnessed the end of the run up.
We really think spy going to pass the ATH with no stimmy anytime soon? Puts.
Made my first profit today
I was going to say...one of us is retarded....and I dont think it's me (today).
I am sure many here would appreciate if you elaborated on this comment.
What's the news on ACB??
For every 50k gain from one guy, there‚Äôs 20 blown up accounts
If its your first PDT restriction do it, you can reset it without the 25k maint requirement. If its not your first time then your fucked
SPY puts started their Black Friday sale early!  Whose loading up?
This dip is ultimately a good thing for NIO. If it holds its position above support, it will have filled its gaps and can continue on back up.
Going to 12 bc why tf not
I like how it JUST crashed
Was hoping that was the case, that‚Äôs what it looks like. I‚Äôm relatively new the the market so wasn‚Äôt completely sure but sounds good üëå
NIO to 38... Watch
Be patient acb has formed a bull flag pattern

i do not give any investment advice. do your own research because it is your OWN money

Yeah I agree with that. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a fair comparison to PRPL haha. 

But to the autists here that blindly buys calls, it might as well be PRPL

Brain starved oof dunning Kruger for table 7 please

Someone‚Äôs miserable he got nio calls at its high
idk man, the chinese people at the local takeout place always sound pretty happy and they are definitely not hitting their EPS
Double down on pton calls
It got filledüòÄüòÄ
HEY, HEY YOU, YEA YOU, i missed out on the chinese ev run, whats the next fat play?
This markets pissing me off. BABA, SQ down, SPY up, limp dick GME, it‚Äôs about as opposite as I guessed
i always assume somebody just made a huge dumb losing play when that happens
Calls on Aol
nio party over
risk more, make more.
BABA bagholders gonna get burned F
If you are trading with couple hundred K.  50k isn‚Äôt crazy.  There is a wide range of account values here, there are a few people playing with 7 or more figures on here.
Why didnt you cash out at least 100k?
nobody in this thread has heard of earnings IV
Well, my gut was right and it hit my price target pre-market but could not unload the options.
That 280 volume looks so funny to me lol
Nio about to drill hard if it breaks down 45
Let's Fuck Citron!
I‚Äôll remind you on Tuesday when I get them sweet tendies ;)
Die NIO Die
PLTR the 1/15 calls r pretty cheap
Chinese is a language of all inflections, that won‚Äôt even help you haha
RemindMe! Two weeks.
I guess it all depends if you think EV train will continue in the upcoming months.
idk it broke the Bollinger bands, anything could happen to it now
All Nio call holders, you‚Äôll make the same money buying puts you know right?
they go in with the intention of losing it all and posting here, but sometimes it works for the few
Y'all pointed out how badly overvalued Tesla is, but pump Nio?  Lmfao, Nio's current valuation is even worse than Tesla's...by far.
What is ACB doing?
I wish TSLA would stop shitting itself
Oh no! Feels bad
Buddy, that‚Äôs what you sound like too. I hate to break it to tou
same goes to those trading youtube ads. those poeple who get filmed are so cringe
life will be great if PTON goes below 100 and TSLA goes below 400 and both stay there.

Never
It dipped ;)
is there anyway this holds up by EOD? Holding back so hard putting 10k on puts for the 3pm dump to 354-355
Did your wife‚Äôs boyfriend tell you that
Almost half this sub tried to time puts on corona cases earlier this year and got ass blasted. I'm guessing the new autistic short bus rolled in this quarter.

And now you got me pining for shrimp tacos
To all the NIO holders out there, just know that we have all been there.  You don't wanna sell but you know you should.  You'll hold over the weekend and tell yourself it will be ok while deep down knowing that it won't be.

Monday hits and the depression kicks in.  "I should have sold" you will tell yourself.  So you sell.  Then on Tuesday it rallies to new highs
ACB has giant retard strength behind it

I‚Äôve currently got 979 shares, I‚Äôve been holding for a while now, what you guys suggest?? Hold or sell and accept the loss :/
I don't disagree at all, I thought nio was an awesome buy earlier this year in light of China's controlled economy (I stopped trading a few months ago after I realized I was no longer being rational), but like... Once shits being spammed that hard here you gotta realize that these plays are getting riskier
Yes Fubo will be big actually.

COST making everyone wear masks now.. calls
That‚Äôs what I keep thinking, but I think they‚Äôre getting Anti trust slapped by China
Haven't made any huge moves in awhile. In August got out of leveraged SPY and FAANG since the volatility decay and rebalancing eats up gains. Not worried about a crash since its a long term buy but taking profit is probably prudent.
I like to bleed my account every once in awhile... just to keep it honest
Its a meme Chinese stock. They're R&D is probably a room full of bootleg solidworks and altium, shit Chinese printers, some knock off bridge ports, and a wall full of chinesium.

How common is this scenario? You called the first part perfectly - Citron tweet fucked everyone who bought at the open. Have you seen this a lot?
The NIO calls I sold literally yesterday at noon are still down 20% (or I guess up, i‚Äôm down 20%)

NIO mooning on Monday because Monday isn‚Äôt Friday 13th

You heard it here first
Hopefully your right because i bought at $52 and I don't feel very good right now.
Like just NOW? Kiss your profits goodbye
ACB going vertical
Wtf is up with $CNK? Movie theaters popular again?
I'm a therapist bro.. you can talk to me
The secret is no one makes that consistently every day
Insane buying pressure on U
I don't even listen to the phone call I just watch the numbers go up or down and sell accordingly
That's why I don't like selling options. Also it can really fuck you bad if it goes against you
be less poor and inverse me
need a 500$ play
Or he secretly buying this dip and fronting shit to those eating. Not making a judgment either way, but you need to step back and look at what‚Äôs going on and don‚Äôt base your entire plan on one dude fronting his take on things.

I just would like to see a couple dollar jump on NIO so I can get out. Slept in a missed the spike this morning like an idiot.
Or should I sell a 40p for next friday
I saw like 12 new posts last night about SHOULD I BUY NIO CALLS????
NIO is no TSLA, no where near it actually lol
Which means they're going to talk about how Fisker already went bankrupt once with their shitty car no one wants, and how Citron is clowning on the EV valuations given the wild run-up
Hehe, un-Call-ed for.
Holding 3550 support very well.

No. Don't do it.

"if you always do what you always did, you'll always get what you always got."
If you guys with deep pockets wanna manipulate NIO you should make it close under 43.70. That will trigger large crayon related selling.
Not if you bought Monday morning
People freaking at NIO hitting a resistance and comes back down. Resistance will be at $44. $1200 by Monday EOD.
If boeing breaks 190-192 we are at least going to 216, but i think we will retest June high or $230 and could possibly get to $250 before we pull back. 737 recertification and moderna vaccine data could be the catalysts next week.
Ha. That‚Äôs me. I got fucked.

NIO buy volume was so high this morning, there's gonna be another round of buying to average down and likely $55+ Monday for an earnings sell off. Another boom in buy orders after lunch...this shit's gonna see 600m+ in volume EOD and probably $53 again.

No positions, just chart grilling.

Got rid of my NIO puts too early....oh well green is green
If somehow you managed to owe more than you have, they will likely liquidate everything and maybe sue you.
If you've still got 30+ years of growth just leave indexes on autopilot. If you're looking to do actual, plain investing, I recommend dollar cost averaging. Put in say $1000 every month. It may go down in the short run but long term growth should significantly outweigh.

If you've only got a few years left I would consider cashing out now though.
No worries it's actually a good sign that it has stabilized compared to other stocks.
What‚Äôs sending CNK?
So not trying to blow this play up but BABA is yugely on sale rn correct?

Check my history. I can‚Äôt work full time. I try to post 10 times an hour that NIO 35 Tuesday. Up 20k today on puts. Pog.

Why would NIO shed 10% in an hour days before earnings
Theoretically if someone has 10c 11/13 GE and they‚Äôre worth nothing today do they lose just the premium or is there more at risk
If ur up right now I‚Äôd sell
Gonna be more sales for Nio reported on earnings
Puts on NIO cause I hate money

Daft. We're all looking for any news/event to provide local GME spikes to help trigger short squeeze, not invested in the long term health of this company.

But also...what other retail would you buy a console from? I'd rather go to gamestop than wait in the target electronics department for 15 mins to get a rep that's not busy.
Wait for lunch break. 1 to 2pm. That'll probably be today's lowest low.

Buying NIO calls for ER when you won't even be able to fuckin understanding what they're saying on the call is a true WSB move
EV has a brighter future than mattresses though. Especially if propped up by CCP.

WHY BABA WHY
Why buy puts when there's vaccine news soon.?Market is already reinvesting in the same dumb shit it bought this Monday.
alright, i'm a retard, do you have any predictions of your own? any tickers I can monitor to assess the developments?
This is a good idea. This makes sense. Nobody will listen.
Nio bears congrats. You deserve this one day. Get out before ER tho that shit will kill you.

Of course NIO would tank I should‚Äôve checked the date
that's what I did, well got it yesterday, but todays gains covers it.
Sold my $40 calls RIGHT at the top baby.  Still time for my puts to print... drillllllll
You guys are tards, when Tesla was beating every analyst ppl were still buying... will be laughing once NIO tips the $60s before or after earnings report...
At least you‚Äôre still up sounds like
Lol I sold 60 for less than that
I sold my calls at $53 for a 300% return but if I had day trades left I would definitely be buying this dip. I‚Äôm not done with NIO yet I plan on buying back in before earnings I just don‚Äôt know what the weekend holds to buy back now.
[deleted]
I had a good return but clearly sold too quick.  Got 400% though.
Low vol = pump
I am buying before market close for earnings
So I actually cashed out some of my VOO for NIO / CRSR / PLTR. I‚Äôm gonna hold NIO for at least a year so I just keep buying it every week or every two weeks
Will weekend news be a vaccine or lockdowns ?

If GM was actually profiting on their super cheap EV in China, don‚Äôt you think they would say so instead of avoiding the question? I think it‚Äôs a play for market share and they‚Äôre bleeding.

Thank you for the comforting read. Bought $75k of shares at $246 in July. Was worth $95k not too long ago, never sold any, and now back down to just above where I started. 

Got in for the long haul, though. Gotta keep reminding myself of that.
Just like everyone else, testing has him at a 50/50 chance.

This Post is hurting a lot of people's feelings, lol! The Upvote/downvote swing has been crazy.
Read that article from Citron. They decided to cash in early. Too early imo. Thats their choice. But they'll will have to live with the regret of not staying in when this green dildo gets them in the ass on monday.

Good thing I have one suspect NIO put that might print by EOD
sold NIO puts too soon. Always happens.
Lol..you are late
Launchpad for 70
Lol at NIO
That‚Äôs when it really tanks
GM resist at $41 / support at at $33

37p 11/27 could be a many bagger =/
We'll be back with a vengeance next week.  
It'll either be the resurrection, or the death knell.  


Either way, you're going to be hearing NIO all the way up until WED.
Lol it's 450mm and its a Canadian ev company. Their car experience was for making like custom cars. Their not worth that much wait for it to pop again if you believe in them
volume on spy is pathetic
Red

My may calls don‚Äôt give a flying fuck

I feel like no one learned shit from Prpl. Now they all have chafed NIOpples.

That would gap my 401k's asshole with just wads of cash.
I sold at top ,  Not sure who is the lucky one
Sell NIO ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fair warning.   The minute I by puts on NIO its going up.
Yes I understand that , but if you are on high leverage , you will have a extra dept right ?
I would if I could
Nio blowing up like I thought it would
Citron eating up the cheap calls now
Thanks for the head up. Sold all NIO at 49.
For how long? I have no faith they stay open
XPENG NIO and LI will pump again 

NIOs earnings are next week!
Literally me right now üòÇüòÇ
All the greedy fucks that didn‚Äôt sell nio at open today getting shmacked üòÇüòÇ
Ok, bought 10 of the 180strike, 12/4 expiry
Talk it out what are you feeling. I‚Äôm feeling the same things your are prob
That's exactly why I stayed out of GME.
Might as well of put it all on red in Atlantic City.
On the same boat, hold this thing is going back up big time
I finally gave up on nio and put a condor on it. Gonna try to make money off IV crush and the swings
Holy shit you‚Äôre retarded.

You don‚Äôt even know what a market cap is do you?
üåàüêªüá∫üá∏ü¶Ö

sold NIO at its high and i'm proud of it

~~lost the money immediately though~~
How many of you idiots just went broke on NIO
118 AAPL puts
NIO are actually much better looking cars than TSLA
Yup it does. But price rose too much, too fast. NIO is destined to be only 2nd to tesla.
Friendship ended with nio, fsr is my new best friend
ü§°ü§°ü§° here
Aaaannnd there goes all my gains this week
What did your tarot cards say? I‚Äôve got a lot of files saved about support and resistance levels for entry and exits if you‚Äôd like me to send them to you.
Luckily I only lost all the gains I‚Äôve made.
Just barely broke even

All love brother. But definitely take care of that margin call.
Seems like 3 wheeled vehicles would have a very small market.  Don't see value there. Seems to be riding EV hotness.
Mods
I still am lost here. SPXS is about $4-5 a share. It's a 3x leveraged ETF so it will lose money insanely fast when the market moves even slightly against it. You're going to buy and hold this to get pennies per share selling calls? What am I missing here?

boys here is my rant for the day. 

the market does what a majority of people dont expect to happen. i hear a bunch of you clowns on here saying sPy pUts because of the increasing covid cases. Listen ladies and gentlemen every dickbrain on here and on wall street understands the severity of the situation.

As explained last night in my rant, the bond market is the market to be on the lookout for, more specifically the corporate bond market, which at the time of writing this looks to be doing A ok. All of you doomers trying to time this crash are trying to do something, which is very difficult and your rationale of covid numbers increasing is so infantile it is almost laughable. 

Now if you boys and girls can tell me something like I see the spread of s and p to 30 year bonds decreasing or I see the corporate bond market begin to have a liquidity crunch I will start to hear you out. Sometimes you have to look at bigger macroeconomic themes if you really want to reap the rewards of this game. 

This game is not so simple and yes I understand that this is a wendy's, but for fucks sake at least if you go to a wendy's you should know not to order shrimp tacos.
How is U up 12% ??

IV was just way too high for me to only buy calls
You don't think high spec growth is cooling off w/ interest rates creeping up?
Oh no, not your sense of smell!
Welcome to what it was like in the .com era, when dumbasses bought wildly overinflated and overvalued companies like pets.com, eToys, etc.  This is what it was like to watch daytraders who thought they were hot shit lose their shirts overnight.  Nio, Li, XPEV = modern day .com like stocks.

They will sell your holdings.
Just now? Nah
Memes aside I wonder if I should sell nio puts at support or will it make a new low today...

fuck should maxed out on those NIO puts
This is looking better and better by the minute

Small positions on buying while green is my general rule.  It‚Äôs better than nothing, and leaves you with enough to average down if you did buy the top and still think it‚Äôs got room to run.
You nio bag holders sound a lot like mango man supporters, in denial of your loss lol
Did you hold? Shockingly I held my put and am in good shape here
Nio is still up 10% for the week.  Leap holders shrugging.

This is a good sign congrats. What job?
So..who bought NIO at the top today?
If I buy it will go down. If I don‚Äôt buy it will go up. Life is a prison of my own design.
U think NIO is worth more than BMW or gm?
Citron fucks lots of retail fomo peeps. Citron such asshole
so more calls?
All the GME discussions i've read have pointed at Jan calls being the play. I have a bit of 11/20 also though, i'd love to see some action soon.
Citron said fuck NIO and WSB
Stabilizing to move higher.
Knew it lol
Damn dude, I can buy these for 6.80 rn, I'm a bear, and I'm still not biting.
Rotating like a girl in a brand new dress
Man... 

This actually does make me feel better.
Been looking for some Biden Energy plays. FCEL BE WPRT all are jumping lately? My NIO FOMO is kicking in

That's five days in a row. When that bump comes it's gonna be huge.
Half and half.  Florida isn't stopping anything.  Parks are hitting capacity and they are going to open it more. Dis will be at 160 by summer.  Disney also isn't allowing passholders to renew.  So everyone pays when they go.  No accrued revenue.   DIS fans are loyal Md waiting to go.  They also gave all the Verizon wireless subscribers 1 year free access to Disney+.  Guess what, that just expired this week. Millions will be renewing this month and next to see Mando and all other stuff.  I had it on my calendar to cancel and I won't due to Mando.  It will auto renew and I will probably forget it.

If Nio is lulling instead of going down, cool with that for now until it slowly goes upward. Not a fan of retard strength, that slow incline up is healthy
I bought NIO calls at 47.5 for next week. Am I fuk?
So how many greedy fucks didn‚Äôt close NIO calls at 53 this morning?

Yeah, you‚Äôre just retarded.

Eric Andre is a fucking genius.
Vaccine, right?
I've figured out that when I watch and listen to CNBC, I lose money.  When I just look at momentum and read comments here, I make money.
To be honest you should‚Äôve waited for moderna to announce results about their vaccine next week ,the market is gonna respond the same way they did this Monday when Pfizer announced their results ,only if the results are good obviously,just my opinion
> Either support or resistance really
Puts at the bottom, love it
Just looked into SOLO. Looks pretty legit, not a bad speculative long hold. Might buy a few hundred shares and sit.
Dump this shit to 40  let‚Äôs go
Difficult to account for a short seller thesis being randomly released.
Either support or resistance really
Check and see if they have an upcoming quarterly update, might be why the IV is at 102%
It's shot every time they've had a flight, but then falls back down. 

It's almost a sure deal for the short term.
Someone please poke GME. Consoles are out, I was promised tendies.

Well at least WSB didn‚Äôt kill EV.  Citron did.
OH NO NO NO NIOBROS

HOW COULD WE EVER IMAGINED THAT A STOCK THAT LITERALLY DOUBLED IN A MONTH WOULD EVENTUALLY DROP?!?!

THERE WAS NO WAY TO PREDICT WE WOULD BE PROBABLY BUYING AT THE TOP!!

I think this is a good topic as the Covid vaccine by Pfizer needs to be stored and minus 78 Celsius which is very difficult.  A refrigerator that can do that is not common and usually only research labs or universities have them.
Exactly! Got calls on Nio? If so good luck bro.
It only takes a single 11/27 30p to protect a lot of call value.
Earnings are Tuesday. I bought around 47.8 and will sell when I see some runup to 50. IV is only going up.

u got low IQ if u think NIO boutta die. earnings Tuesday, all hype
Perfect.
NICE! Sold my insurance puts too early üòï hope you sold and flipped back to calls!
The furthest call's peak is lower than a sooner close date...

Why do you think the CCP even wants EVs any time soon?  All the Chinese battery technology is garbage and they don't care about any environmental regulations.
I might sell most of my position before earnings. Not because I'm bearish, I'm terrified of the IV crush.

Ive been buying throughout this dip. Got 35k in shares. I really anticipate a spike. But will buy another 15k or so at 240 if we hit that.
I‚Äôve missed these bad news melt ups
All it took was some little dinky 2 page bear song to start tanking NIO.  If your stock is that sensitive to a small bit of an opinion piece, then beware.  It just proves how much of an insane bubble it is.  LOL @ Nio worth more than GM and BMW.
I‚Äôm thinking: Lol nah, it‚Äôll drop after ER. The run up to ER is the the play, the run down after ER is the play next. It‚Äôll even out for a while once all WSB short attention span goes elsewhere, then it‚Äôll rise again.
Glad for once I didnt fomo back into NIO at the top
Ho ho! You dare to approach Me, NIO?
This sounds too logical to be here
If you think the scam company Moderna is going to save us from the pandemic you crazy
I mean, as long as you bought nio yesterday you'd still be up.

Wtf is BA doing?!
For real tho, sell that shit. NIO is topped out for the moment
Good time to buy more NIO
Still üíéüëãüèª
NIO is a company
XPEV is Xiao Peng, "little peng" based on the name of the founder.

The name is absolutely shit, it won't be popular just from the name factor lol. But that doesn't mean the stock can't run up more.
That's the break point if spy goes below 355.25 on the 15 minute chart we are going to 351.
Where should i buy stocks?
That‚Äôs fucked up
This is a cute bull trap in the s&p. Bears will win out by Monday.

NIO 40 EOD
[removed]
jnug dec 140-150c
If you‚Äôve been paying attention this week in particular. It‚Äôs the collective stance of big money around the world. And it‚Äôs contagious. The bottom like keeps going up. Which means the peaks will only keep getting higher from here.
Just remember regret is the most pointless possible emotion. It's becoming upset about one of the few things over which you have no influence whatsoever; the past. It doesn't matter if you could've made 490k or 490M. We could all be billionaires dozens of times over if we just made different plays. "What if" won't get you gains.
We're all hanging out at club 15.51 for the next hour.

Mmm GME has become my dark fantasy were I love getting assfucked but secretly want to make money
Earnings are on Monday
Proof or ban
Don‚Äôt worry it will go back up. It just skyrocketed so people will sell and then when people sell price goes down, and then more people buy it and the price goes up and the cycle continues
I‚Äôm with you
Rotation out of NIO into PLTR
I would say wait till it tests 250, if it can close above 258 buy. It broke the Bollinger bands so tread carefully.
I didn‚Äôt buy - thought I‚Äôd see how today went, and your comments did make me wonder what I wasn‚Äôt seeing. Man it‚Äôs nearly down 5% right now.
How confident are you in that prediction?
I can‚Äôt wait for earnings the dump is gonna be spectacular

Why so? Just wondering about your reasoning
Damn buddy, when you gonna exercise that?

I‚Äôm gonna keep holding don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go below 5 anytime soon and I got in at 4 so
sell your calls idiot, the signs point to a fat shit after hours

NIO was the craziest ride, man. Can‚Äôt wait for the next big meme stock rave party.
Would be nice is NYSE trading was open 8 hours a day like Europe instead of 6.5 hours
Took me 4 days to settle down 10k, lost 9k from NIO 0dte call today as soon as money settled down. Big oof moment I‚Äôm having

Alright so how‚Äôs this for a plan . mRNA otm debit spreads, zm otm debit spreads. Vaccine pump from MRNA & I‚Äôm good. Lockdown & zoom moons. I‚Äôm shit out of ideas, also eyeing BA 737 but will wait until Monday
NIO gonna be 44 eod. There's weekend fear.

I'm buying more calls on Monday, only holding longs.
I'm with you...

You are so wrong. You probably think that a million cases per week in the US alone will hurt markets. Wrong. You think that people not gathering for holidays will hurt markets? Wrong. You think a lack of christmas shopping because everyone has been unemployed since February will hurt markets? Wrong.

Stick to paper trading kid.
Yeah i bought and sold in the dip like a pussy
Good luck then, hope I see you on your yacht soon

Well now spy is going to the same old April - August trend. Boring.
Nah, winding up
Yeah getting out so they can get in moonday!
Nio is down because people are selling their xpeng from yesterday. It seems that people bought xpeng, nio, and li at the same time as one group. Its a smart idea, but each different company is reloering earnings on different days...if all 3 were reporting on the same day, I would have sold yesterday then re-bought today. Nio is the big dog of the three...wait until after their report to make a decision to buy/sell
Buy the crash!!!
How do you know when the lock up ends? I thought it was only 3 months so now you got me curious
I‚Äôm glad man! I‚Äôve taken profits too. And continue to buy the dips and sell on the peaks. Slightly miss timed this one but have been and will continue to be profitable on this company and EVs as a whole sector üòÅ ride the green wave. It‚Äôs your friend.

Timing is no coincidence. The fact that XPEV and LI mooned after their earnings and the fact that this report came out 2 days before their ER is super sus. They could‚Äôve easily waited 2 days for the ER and publish their report on Wednesday after all the data. So their objective isn‚Äôt to be objective. And we shouldnt take their report seriously.

It will eventually be the bottom. There there
Buy and sell before earnings
XPEV being pinned right now is baffling why isn't it dropping
if you rearrange the letters in 'traders' you get 'retards'
NIO has seen its bottom before.

It can only go down from here.
I'm sitting in Nio 11/20 $40p that I picked up near end of day yesterday and feeling pretty good
Bought more late Dec/ Jan Chinese EV calls. Everyone wants to buy in a dip, but few have the balls to do so.

What we should learn about China/ Xi from BABA this week is that the CCP makes the god damn rules. If they want EV to happen & if they want to have domestic competitors to Tesla et al.-- they will make sure it happens.
That‚Äôs a very level headed stance to take
I followed the law of opposites yesterday and bought Dec 18 49P. Up 30% right now.

Update: I'm standing upright rn. If you get what I'm saying.

This is one horrible side effect of the pandemic. Everyone focuses on death rate, while not considering other factors such as morbidity, strain on medical institutions, etc. And what is happening is that small businesses are closing and working class people are becoming unemployed as corporations get richer. There needs to be a consideration for both effective shutdowns as well as economic relief for people, both of which will save lives IMO
Buy now
Imagine today is the March 13 2.0 bahaha
And just like that nio goes down
Hey man. Here‚Äôs a gold star, go buy a prostitute with those peanuts you got.

Yeah idk the way their cars look alone makes me think Americans aren't gonna go for that shit. But maybe the stock pumps anyways because EV, good luck to you but I'm sitting this one out.
yes not as many call buys there it seems, but u can still get filled in the middle if its not running already, peep MELI
No no you‚Äôre the smart one. You buying Apple and Microsoft when the hedge funds are pulling out is the right move you got this. Oh insiders are also selling? Nah keep buying what can go wrong. Absolutely nothing you guys definitely have a better grip on the stock market than the people who do it for a living.

Does anyone here work as a market maker? Im looking at the Canadian side of stocks vs the US side and the spread on Canadian options is fucking massive. Apha for example, is trading at $5.67USD and 7.45CAD.  The January 15 options on the US for $6 are bid/ask of 0.67 and 0.69, while the $7.50 options on the Canadian side are 0.89/1.03. Is the difference simply because the canadian market is smaller?

Is it smart to buy NIO calls now? I know it might drop after earnings so I am feeling like I should wait until after. But this dip right now is tempting me to pick up some cheap calls.
Bullish/bearish next week?

They also have better EV technology and self driving data/tech than all of those other automakers combined. Biden administration likely to pass renewed federal $7000 EV credit that Trump stopped.
The dip was today. Meaning on excellent earnings(which nio will have) the stock will be passing the orbit of Jupiter slingshotting to Pluto. Best of luck!

This post is a pathetic attempt at a pump. I know your calls are down bad
Solid DD, but your SPY Put timeline may be a little premature.  I would carry that into March.  There are three main catalysts that could drive down the market, but they many not materialize until January/February:

1) Georgia runoff (if Democrats sweep, market retreats)

2) Biden presidency and subsequent lockdown (January/February is peak flu season and we will likely see the largest numbers then)

3) Q1 beginning of possible recession (Q4 may stay positive, but start of next year is a crapshoot)

Good luck!  I have a hedge, so a significant downturn would be very nice for my portfolio, but we'll see.
Anyone in on Fortress value??
don't do that. the market makers made it pretty evident they dont want this below 355 in the morning session.

JD calls for earnings, remember that BABA sentiment in China is negative rn and positive earnings will be seen as market share being taken away from BABA, similar to PDD.
Lol. !RemindMe 7 days
Depends. If you want shares, sell CSP at a level you wouldnt mind owning at. Or buy shares today and sell higher covered calls. 

I personally think they will beat earnings and will continue to run up higher next week. Maybe $55
It‚Äôs still trending up massively lmao

I sold my calls early today üò≠
You‚Äôre gonna need a lot more than an article written by a salty boomer
True there is uncertainty. But looking at XPEV and LI, and how they pretty much serve the same market, if I have to put my money on it, it would be similar to XPEV/LI.
Honestly if I knew how to buy puts I would have. But I‚Äôm just a simple options trader and I ride the waves
Looks pretty bullish right now

I should of went all in with this instead of NIO given earnings aren't til the 25th, but its all good, my NIO call doesn't expire til Dec 4th so hopefully it recovers next week and FSR soars to 20+ by EOD
BA has formed a bull flag on the 1 month and 3 mo th charts. Alot of talk about that stock in the last week and FAA coming out with recertification of 737 max on Wednesday of next week. I know boeong has a ways to go but could be a good play for next week.

If this panic selling is the result of Citron report, and the fact it hasn‚Äôt tanked more, we ALL know this is the bottom for NIO. Everyone who would‚Äôve sold would‚Äôve sold by now with the encouragement of Citron. Never been more bullish tbh.
ppl want to make money. they want to understand just enough to do that. but that's not the goal for me. it's to understand this shit. turns out that makes me better at making money.

everyone is doing this shit backwards.

Well he's a fucking idiot. This test is quick and can tell if you're a super spreader. It's the same stupid mentality of making a rule from one anecdote. Oh, it's not perfect for me so it must be a garbage test. 

If you're borderline, it means you should probably take the PCR test and self-quarantine just in case.
If it pops back up again I'm buying 11/27 puts. There's no way the valuation is remotely accurate, and anyone holding this thing is holding a timebomb.

And, yes, I am butthurt I sold my 11/20 30cs earlier this week.

They fucked shareholders with a 10-1 r/s and then issued 50% new shares. That was a major dick move for old shareholders made me loose me trust in the management... but they the  skyrocketed.

It‚Äôs okay. Yesterday I sold my $48 calls at like $45. Profited like $250. This morning they were worth profits of like $1900. Then I lost $600 holding SOLO too long.
I have 11/20 calls, you think its best to sell now or hold for next week?
i think spy calls but i also think i‚Äôm retarded
What are your guys thoughts on BABA calls? It‚Äôs dropped so fucking much it looks tasty af

PROTIP: If you see a potential margin call in your TD Ameritrade account and it doesn't make any sense, call them. Just got off the phone with these cucks and they said it was a false call and not to worry about it; their system is doing some calculations wrong.

Thanks for the feedback man.

Yeah I plan on holding everything long term, I don't day trade as I've been learning to trade Forex for the past 7 months. Have been profitable for this whole month so far, Long way to go still but I'm enjoying the journey!

 I see a future in which EV companies rule the world. I absolutely adore Tesla and even though they are definitely over valued at the minute, I still feel as though 400$ is a steal considering where they plan to be in 5 years, the innovation is incredible. If they can pull off autonomous driving, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest (who has a huge stake in Tesla) believes it will be worth anywhere between 15-25,000$ (1/5 split of course). Ron Baron multibillionaire investor who has been correct on every Tesla call since the beginning believes it will reach 15,000. If they can pull off autonomous driving and introduce autonomous taxi's (which cathie wood is sure they will achieve as well as musk himself) the company will sky rocket. 

I am going to look into solar stocks now, specifically the ones you've recommended but did you know Tesla also produce batteries , as well as the recent introduction of Tesla Solar Panel roofing?

And yes, my plan is to save every cent I can and invest it, I'm so glad my mindset is like this as I see my friends wasting there money effortlessly. 

Thanks again for the feedback!

This is how I‚Äôve made big gains on debits. Zero crush. And on credits the crush actually helps. Made 900 overnight with 12 amzn credits. The underlying only moved $20 from where I bought and I scalped $75x12 off crush. Love credits going into Fridays.

I should have loaded up on the dip
If TSLA can at least end green today, that‚Äôll be swell
[deleted]
Why
Yep, I bought calls pretty far out thinking I was going to be a rich genius and now I just look like a poor retard.
right now we are running on 70% average volume on spy based on a 200 day average.
Sell them out of the money collect the premium. If it hits then you‚Äôre fine if it doesn‚Äôt keep buying calls. I sold a call on SPXS if it does hit okay great sell at the strike and wait to buy more. You don‚Äôt even have to sell calls, but this sub is obsessed with money and usually have no downside protection. I figured that could be a good compromise. What I like to do is wait for a nice correction sell an ITM call collect that premium and wait for the market to recover. I hold my hedge and I make a little more money to buy the dip. Lately I won‚Äôt do that though because personally I believe a correction is coming and I want to hold my SPXS shares.
Almost noon, Xi Jinping said they‚Äôd be buying by then. This should be good
Even Ford is getting runoff EV hype
Thoughts on UVXY 20c for 11/27?

Eh let it sink to 30
***EV Sector Rotation into FSR***
Gap at 31 on NIO needs to be filled
I don't know what they meant, but if you have other job offers it might give you leverage in salary negotiations.
I would wait for 356.5/357 if we get there. Or maybe clear resistance somewhere. I'm with you tho
Second bearcoming
Ahh yeah it kind a stabilized at 30 I know but but it will bleed to 20 cent in the next week or so lol sorry I didn‚Äôt understand just saw you write 60 lol you don‚Äôt have to be a bitch about itüòÇüòÇ
What's the expiration date of the call?
LI, NIO, & XPEV all shot up drastically and were due for a pullback. Not sure when they will rise again, but they eventually will (maybe next week after $NIO earnings?)
I am honestly convinced it‚Äôs a way to fuck people out of money and no amount of logic will sway me
[deleted]
Wash sales only matter if you‚Äôre trying to cheat taxes by taking a loss at the end of year and then buying back in as if you never sold. Which is a pretty specific case, but often gets misunderstood as ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt claim losses if you play the same stock frequently‚Äù.
Yeah let‚Äôs believe an article written by a short seller. Sounds like some gay bear shit
Diamond hands here. I'll hold this stock til it burns.
Citron they are fuckers
I advise to buy shares of DGRO, it's heavy in value while still having a few of the big tech names in it. For options I suggest you pick Calendar spreads as a strategy to utilize. For instance. I think AMD will hit 90 by years end. Sell a 12/18 90 call and then Buy a 1/15/21 90 call. The call you sell gives you downside protection and increased gains if the stock ends up around 90. I highly suggest you read about the "Greeks" of options, look at profit/loss graphs of different plays to gain understanding of how it works (optionsprofitcalculator.com) and watch Youtube Videos galore until you feel like you got a hold of how it works. Buy shares and only play with small % of your total in options.
Actually at peak too... I did good this week
[deleted]
Becky has to talk to someone besides the wine glass
Buy at the top then let Citron Research send out a tweet üòÑ
yeah, and also SPY will go to an ATH.
I mean it's way up today. Idk man. Might hold for a bit.
im sorry bro. i hope you are doing fine.
is this a buull flag? buy calls rn?
Seriously have a 12-4 108c I‚Äôm waiting to go back up
I think so
Yeah, ludicrous. Vaccine P&D shit is hilarious rn.

PFE Monday, MRNA coming up, who knows when JNJ will release results. Not trying to fuck with travel rn tbh. Maybe I'll consider strangles.
Alright here we go. SPY 0dte 354 engage!

Going to $100 near March. Claimed it since it was $11 and sticking with it.
Markets trade sideways 24/7/365 in hell.
Now imagine if you weren‚Äôt poor.

Want to buy tech but I‚Äôm scared of mrna positive news over weekend
[deleted]
Both. I sold to cover cost and some profit but IV is insane. My puts are low 30s. I'll buy more later. I'll keep some just incase but a 32P 11/20 should not be worth .67 when stock is 47.50. I bought these not to be a gay bear but because nio will miss ER. 

If they nio drops again today I will sell all but 2 or 3
No BA should cause that makes more sense
And besides all the people dying, more people who survive are still facing debilitating symptoms. Shit I even got COVID in March and my sense of smell is still fucked up. Far from ‚Äúa bad cold‚Äù

Okay citron, where the fuck is your report about fisker? Over a billion market cap with nothing until 2022, you dumb fuck
Will pton go back up over next two weeks?
No NIO crashing
TDOC so gay
It‚Äôs going to be flat for the rest of day. Rip
Free money is coming to an end
Or 40 I‚Äôd be even more happy
Bought a call this morning on PLAY should I hold or sell while its up?
I‚Äôm holding honestly. It may not explode like NIO but there‚Äôs rumors of dominos and other delivery services preordering a bunch. They‚Äôll sell at least commercially in NA and possibly move to Europe and Asia markets
wtf BA...
Spy puts pton calls. That‚Äôs the play
Nice! I have been doing poor mans covered calls against my long term in the same way

I don't think that as Africa is a shithole.

Because some pussy decided to
Sell a lot of his shares
If states lockdown again, shouldn't BABA and SQ go up?
BEARS IN SHAMBLES
Hope you sold retard
Right now since the company is new they can say "its supposed to be losing money.. its a growth stock" and for the valuation being high:. "Its a growth stock, you have to look 10 years out". And for justification.. look at the demand for nio cars in China
just curious do you have a link to earnings estimates?
Haha yeah seems never any flat days for it
It worries me that tech is potentially topping out as vaccine news starts coming in. But I'm still not convinced how people suddenly think value and travel stocks are great buys, given that it'll take a full year for people to be vaccinated meaningfully and there's always the danger of mutation
Because you touched yourself.
I‚Äôm cash gang this weekend except on jd and baba. Might regret missing out on a little money if it blows up by Monday but I‚Äôm playin it safe
Buy into AQUA water most important commodity
Should I sell my PLTR shares and buy NIO
There‚Äôs I believe a $2000 minimum but in 5 mins this gets my dick hard

(Am poor person though)
BABA chillin at $258
Me LOL
I doubt itü§°
My hunch is it will wild out before opex but I have no idea which direction. I want to say "up" because the put call ratio is a little above normal but who knows what the macro trends will be on mon and tues.
If NIO touched $44 real quick before gapping to $55 I'd be happy.
Wtf happened to peloton. Fucking pump and dump.
It would‚Äôve started by now don‚Äôt you think
[deleted]
Ah I just read the advisor retracted his early comment because congress would probably not support it lol. They're just banking it all on the vaccine it seems .
you can't compare the two because tesla has been around much longer..but NIO is much further along after five years than tesla was..tesla will always be top dog...NIO will be a top EV alongside..plenty room for all. people who are panic selling are funny..doesn't change NIO's fundamentals..they aren't  Nikola..they have a working product that is back ordered..
Oh good I‚Äôm praying for this

given the current economic climate it is absolutely bizarre that we are flirting with all time highs, but then again this market is devoid of fundamentals because of the FED
I think you‚Äôre misinformed and unable to see into the future. If you could go back in time and invest in Ford when he first created the assembly line. You‚Äôd be Rockefeller rich. You need to understand. The EV market is a similar phenomenon. ICE is dead by 2030. The only ICE vehicles left will be in third world country‚Äôs and antique car shows. I wish you the best of luck bud. Just get out of your own way üòÅüëå

Can someone please explain to me why nio would go up any further? I got absolutely hammered this week with my other plays and I‚Äôm over here thinking about jumping on the Nio rocket, but it seems like it‚Äôs not leaving the station again any time soon.

Once all the big boys have their electric vehicles ready, this EV bubble is going to utterly collapse and destroy people‚Äôs portfolios. They‚Äôll eat up all the market share and these meme EV companies will be left floundering on the sidelines

Sold all my puts on Boomer stocks yesterday, noticed all of my positions and more we're now inversing. Already planned on inversing to cash in on moderna. Easy money so far, just gotta hope it's not priced in by the time news drops.

You mean a single buy contract isn't a yolo? Shocking.
All the vaccine recovery plays are ripping
It's ok. ..... I bought calls before the drop and now I'm holding the suckered through earnings.
so.. why exactly are reopening stocks mooning and tech down? Aren't we literally just hitting new ATHS for rona
Sorry I read that as snark, I hope things pick up for you

You momos accept sector rotation is occurring with Microsoft and Apple, but also think now is a time to be overly bullish. do you people not understand how much of the ENTIRE stock market these two names make up? I‚Äôm not even talking about the ETFs on the dow Jones, Nasdaq, or spy I‚Äôm talking the entire market. If you think we can have any type of bull market without these names moving up I got calls to sell you.
The market closed early?
Positions or ban
Awful play

Agreed. It's pricing in 100% of the company's potential, not reflecting any risk that they don't succeed.
Citron was the mistake.
>triple top

Is this your favorite position? 3x penetration?

How is this a bearish signal lol, its literally a gamble. Either we breakout or we don't....I guess you have a crystal ball?
i bought a bunch too but bullish news is comin out i guess
I‚Äôm generally pretty bullish, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling today. Not buying anything, thinking we‚Äôll see some downward movement next week.
Die NIO you commie fuck. USA USA USA
Yeah it tracks volatility, shits about to get messy, 160k+ people are being diagnosed with a deadly virus everyday and it‚Äôs rising, I‚Äôm sure this‚Äôll pay off, the question is how much profit do I sell at.
The price action, recently, is pump and dump like. Being an EV company may be the only thing the two have in common.
Idk... that is a pretty large % increase over a short time. I would personally go a bit further out with my calls
Is NIO overvalued? sure they are as is tesla..zoom and peloton..doesn't change fundamentals of the company in where they are headed..NIO is a legit company moving forward..whatever tesla does with the model Y in china will be countered by NIO after..all this is too be expected as no one can be surprised with this "report"..duh it's overvalued..but I still love NIO...just another chance to stock up once it goes down :)
Moderna vaccine news maybe leaked repeat of Monday might happen
I was told there would be a Friday the 13th rug pull....

Here's some NIO magic crayons...

As I see it, today was a potential exhaustion gap. Obvious yearnings release next week complicates matters but it's there....  


My guess is NIO closes the week around 48.5. If not, if it has MORE downside, look for 40.50 - 41.50. Upside is obv capped at 50 because options.
This is the way

Selling now or think it will go lower into the earnings?
Buying expired puts for the boys is truly heroic, unless you mean 11/20 which I guess will suffice
And I will promptly be buying calls, depending on the situation. But, agreed.
Nope

Catching these Nordstrom spikes every week is great

Thx for buying my 11/13 54c NIO covered calls at the top.
Guys I‚Äôve made good calls so far so hear me out in this one. I told y‚Äôall to get out yesterday on the EVs and I was right about where the price would dip to and everything. Stay out of the EVs this weekend I have a feeling Monday will have a slight dip again and the news this weekend might fuck things up because as we know this is all rigged by the big wigs and all eyes are on Chinese EVs right now and they might use Tesla or something to try to sabotage it. Wait till Monday then we ride it for the ER

Hopefully for you, people will be buying the dip on all EV. Unfortunately LI didn‚Äôt have the earnings of XPEV and NIO is gonna blow earnings out of the water. I‚Äôd say sell Tuesday while all of EV is running in anticipation for NIO earnings. It might continue to run up with the sector. But also NIO being direct completion might hurt LI so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That's a good point. It makes their report much less credible because they didn't wait for the most up to date information before posting. It means they have an agenda to their paper.
u think. they will be up at some point or somn?
So that is 50/50 basic math
Yeah, I‚Äôm with you. We‚Äôve been in a trading range since beginning of September, currently near the top. With COVID spiking exponentially and no apparent positive catalyst, think we pull back over the next couple weeks to the mid to lower end of the trading range. Low end around 325. Bounce if we get there.

LOL,  Nio has a bigger market cap than both GM and BMW.  Y'all are utterly retarded chasing after this bubble.  Absolutely zero can justify such a lofty valuation, regardless of how big the potential market size of China is.  People have used the argument that hurr, durr durr, 'China is big' to always justify Chinese stock bubble after bubble.  At some point, reality smacks you in the face.   Retards to the slaughterhouse.

Sunday could be good for them or it could be buy the rumor/sell the news. Safe play is sell now especially if you're in for short term but you could also miss out. I have a small position that's in for the long haul.
Where you been man there‚Äôs been people bitching about NIO all week
the sub has a chat room too.
 get out of here with your lonely autistic only dating post.
Its  like Farmers only but only for sad limp tendies.
Welcome to IV cousin. Next time keep an eye on your implied volatility. Earnings plays get fucking wrecked by this every time.
as long as it maintains that support..
Ya leave
Just threw 12k on 900 UVXY shares and I‚Äôm not even worried

NIO is such a troll
Yes they are ü§ë
How are all these non covid stocks mooning? Some shit is going down tonight.
buying an option and then coming here and asking if it will go up or down

nice
Okay the volatility will go up until earnings on the 18th. If you buy puts and calls far enough out that theta doesn't fuck you, you will gain on average from the IV increase.

Or make a large profit if it jumps one way or the other.

You just have to sell before earnings.

I'm doing this but it's probably retarded so don't take this as advice. 

12/18 32p and 12/18 53c, in a 1/2 ratio is my position
I'm sorry bro. No disrespect intended. Veterans' day is a difficult time. Peace be with you,  and good luck to us both in the market.
no fuckin way that will be true lol still spiking almost a year in, the descent will be about the same amount of time

You should always take other interviews. Leverage your current final interview to pressure them to fast track you to the final interview. If you get multiple offers in hand, leverage that for a higher salary upon negotiation.

It‚Äôs hard to say. Investing 8k in NIO that was 2x from a few months prior in the midst of a trade war then global pandemic.... it‚Äôs not like it was some awful decision.

Would it shock anyone that Nio dropped to $25 and stood there for 5 years? If the answer is ‚Äúnot really‚Äù then it‚Äôs hard to justify getting mad about ‚Äúlost gains‚Äù

As I understood it depends on the Options available. Basically someone has to write those options. Writing an option you can make money with commissions but you can also end up in huge debts (as I understand) because you are forced to Sell at the price you write in the option, and if the Buyer (call or put) decides to exercize their Option you are obbligated to buy it

Will it tho..
Anyone selling BABA calls at this sell-off? Will there be a rebound soon? I have 285 12/18
what if she's the one that told you about it.
A lagging indicator. If we plummet it will rise

This means there's a 4% chance he has two false positives, then, right? So a 96% chance he has covid?

This was result of rumours leaking that it was Xi personally that blocked the Ant IPO.

Previously it was just "faceless Chinese regulators shutdown Ant IPO" which caused the original drop.

Then there was news of anti-trust legislation coming in for ecommerce in China, this hit JD, TECHY and BABA.

Finally there is this news that the Ant IPO debacle was a personal fuck you from Xi.

Lol. Citron report on NIO 2 days before earnings? When XPEV and LI mooned after each of their earnings? This timing ain‚Äôt coincidence. Y‚Äôall get manipulated so easily.
Woke up to a face ripping day that turned ugly quick
We just cannot compare nio with Tesla. The huge difference here is Tesla has Elon Musk, people literally think he‚Äôs a god. He cannot fail. Nio can fail. That‚Äôs the difference.
Its big funds pumping and dumping. Today and Monday is when those 401K fund flows come thru.
Could you help a noob out and explain? Or just tell me to fuck off.

Superb- just when you feel like you couldn't be any more mentally stunted, WSB will always remind you that there is someone/thing further along the spectrum than you. Lets pray big Xi authorises a few of the extra 0's on next week's earnings...
What if NIO like traded flat today üò≥
To take profit? Yeah. I mean if it wasn‚Äôt illegal he could just bought the dip he created. That‚Äôd be genius. But to sell out of a company that‚Äôs gonna 10x from this point over the next 3-5 years. Is borderline masochistic.
\~353K capital outlay if you include the 0DTE CSP.

Listen bro you don‚Äôt understand the market at all I‚Äôm trying to help you. Do you know what a bear market is? It‚Äôs not prices are going down. It‚Äôs returns to the upside are non existent. It‚Äôs not about apples price it‚Äôs about Apple not having enough buyers and retail left holding it. If that happens Apple will slow bleed will it bounce sure. However if people stop buying it then we will have a market like Japan. Ten years with no significant returns. That‚Äôs where we are heading if big investors don‚Äôt see any return in Apple or Microsoft. It‚Äôs not about prices bro. You think you‚Äôre smarter than a hedge fund manager? If you do good go all in on Apple, but I am telling you they are selling out and praying there‚Äôs enough retail investors out there to hold their bags.

Not if you sell right before earnings.

I'm saying IV gain will make all the options go up in value until then - "On average". so buy puts and calls insulate yourself from Price movement, and farm IV.

Too much infighting in the Dem party at the moment to rally around any big legislation IMO, someone has a problem with everything. Anyway MGI 8c early next year.

Tesla is over 2000 pre split. Pending nios earnings they‚Äôre projected to be currently doing 8% of tsla sales. 8% of 2000 is 160. Hence avg analyst 52 week projection of 155 a share for nio.

The sheer amount of people in here who had NIO FDs for this week with earnings NEXT WEEK after it already ran up like 50% is astounding.  

Legit see why PDT exists, yall are way to fuckin dumb to be allowed to trade
Dude and it went back down lol u can always go to the penny sub they love playing those. I don‚Äôt say you can‚Äôt make money on them but they would probably do an offering the second it would be high again
NIO is a shit company they've been diluting investors forever, only reason I sold this POS at 3 bucks. Bought leaps at 14 bucks and made nice  money but now its time to short üåù

Localized effect, and has the same impact as flooding the market with dollars. The gold price recovered, though, and dollars just keep getting devalued further. 

That you don't understand economic rationality is not my problem. Economists who would say "but why would someone make a decision that is bad for them?" are ignoring that people are people. They make bad choices all the time, so you can't say that there's an objective standard of economic rationality. A rational choice needs to be considered from the perspective of the person making it and what their stack of preferences are. You may think video games are a waste of time, and someone else may decide they want to do that all day long and live in squalor. The point is that people choose what they want, and economics is the study of human action. Can some of that be measured? Sure. But you would struggle to make a model that X% of people are going to just choose drugs over productivity because it isn't "rational" - and yet people choose it.

Like this discussion - you think it's worth your time to respond. I apparently still do, too. Doesn't seem rational, because we're not getting anywhere, yet, here we are.

Aren't they usually short on whatever they crap on?
My only regret is not buying more
the fuck u on about? we are not up, bitch. my calls are bleeding.
Buy one call and sell a call on the same expiry further otm. So I bought the 59 and sold the 60. My max profit per debit is $100 because that‚Äôs the difference in the underlying multiplied by the 100 shares. But because you‚Äôre capping gains. It costs significantly less to get in.
fuck China and fuck BABA
Yeah it's real fucking dicey atm. If it holds until the afternoon it's probably a good time to buy. "Xi personally says fuck you" is about the hardest they can throw at it so it's unlikely to find more reasons to dump.
Time for some UVXY calls?
Nio down -1.5%. Nov 20 calls up 89%. What have y‚Äôall autists done to this stock?
I have around $10000 invested with nio. I‚Äôm only a few hundred down rn but I‚Äôm not selling. It will recover. I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm $1000 in the red. I‚Äôm going to hold.
Buy the dip tard.
Not enough though.
Tomorrow
Nio $60 EOD
Honestly it still has so much room to fall. We haven't even hit where it was yesterday lmao
The tweet is fake my dude. But yes Nio is too high IMO.
Let‚Äôs clear this up for the retards on the short bus. No citron doesn‚Äôt think NIO is a shit company. They had a buy rating on it all the way back 2 years. Yes they called NIO 2 years ago. The guys you are saying can‚Äôt be right and are retarded called this shit before all of you.

They aren‚Äôt saying it‚Äôs a shit company. They‚Äôre saying it should‚Äôve gone up only 1500% instead of 3000% this year.

Is that really a crazy stance to take?
sold DKNG calls bought EOD yesterday at open then waited like an hour and bought NIO puts, feeling good now if SPY will just remember shutdowns are coming...

This. Biden + democratic house + republican senate basically means nothing of substance will be accomplished until at least 2023, and maybe not until 2025 if democrats still don‚Äôt win the senate then. Gridlock is good for wall st.

I hate that I did it, but I've got paper hands. I sold NIO. Maybe if there's another dip.
I think it‚Äôs a decent risk/reward. 

Keep in mind though that most of these types of stocks are still beat down. Not to mention the market is forward looking and we could start to see more and more vaccine news. So there is also a decent chance it could run away from you
All the best mate. Don't look back here.
30c 1/15/21 i'm still sitting on. I know it's way OTM but it's long enough to get out after a good climb.
Me too bruh
Thats seems like a great explanation. Do people typically place a call about 0.50 cents-$1 more than the current market price? It doesnt make any sense for the current market price is $47 to place a call for $60 just in case it never reaches that a week/month/ or so down the line?
Someone tell me BABA gonna be oke

Haven‚Äôt seen SPY trade in this tight of a range in a while
Here‚Äôs a reminder for you absolute retards. Apple has had significant outflow all month especially from insiders. Apple makes up over 1/30th of the entire stock market. Okay no cause for concern. Microsoft has also had significant outflows all month including insiders and also hedge funds, it accounts for another 1/30th of the entire stock market. If you don‚Äôt think nows a time to be cautious Idk what to fucking tell you people. You can spend less than 500 to buy 100 shares of spxs sell OTM call and if the market does drop you can recuperate. It‚Äôs triple leveraged to the downside it can really reduce your risk to the market in case it does correct.

CHWY is such a tease this week. I've been loading and unloading various 11/27 and 1/21 strikes as they've +10% because I'm scared of it dropping <60 at any random moment if someone with volume decides to dump.
It's a fokin' roller caoster today.
For sure! Send him a bill for grievances loll
Stop losses did it for me üòé
wtf is solo? like the plastic cups?
have u heard of limit orders
Why?
That‚Äôs not the high
I'm only up 5% today. I'm hungry. Why do I feel like end-of-year SPY puts are the play here?
The fuck is baba doing? I mean I get it that stuff goes down, but fuck me.
NIO is classic case of inverse WSB, just gotta wait for peak euphoria (yesterday going into early today)
11/20 65$ call buy. Is this a lotto ticket? Bought today lol
The 1000 IQ move was to buy PENN for DKNG earnings
Yes on the puts. No on OTM EOD expiry you retard
I just did my interview and three to four interviewer took turns to interview me is that a good sign? 

Then they told me I‚Äôm basically hired unless circumstances changed and said that if I have other interview appointments I should give it a try too. 

And then told me to wait for their email.

Is this a good sign?
Thanks for buying my puts.
No money to be made here boys, just come back Monday lol
That and the fact that blow job Tuesday isn't a thing are the two greatest issues facing society today
Lol
Might as well give those $0.93 to the homeless. They‚Äôll be your neighbors soon.
Yeah, call me crazy, but I don‚Äôt see why he‚Äôs getting scrutinized for inconsistent rapid COVID tests. These tests are marketed as accurate, as there is no purpose for an inaccurate test. He‚Äôs simply shining light on an issue that needs to be addressed. Lots of industries are moving towards rapid tests (airlines, cruise lines). If they don‚Äôt work well, people should know instead of promoting a 50/50 test for a false sense of security.
Oh god.... this has to be so painful. So sorry bro.
Well shit, that's good to know
AYRO
You missed the bus, don‚Äôt go to school today
Yeah but hype will bring it back up untill earnings
True, but I‚Äôm not entirely off in my assessment. PLTR is currently around $25 billion market cap. The last time Amazon had a market cap of $25 billion was around 2007. Last time Apple‚Äôs market cap was $25 billion was around 2005. When Google IPO‚Äôd, it had a market cap of $100 billion (4 times Palantir currently). My point still stands, as I‚Äôm sure there are many, many investors who would‚Äôve loved to purchase AMZN shares in 2007, as well as purchase Apple and Google in 2005 at similar or better prices.
hey there really are people like that out there though
FSR & RIDE

AMERICAN EV > CHINESE EV
I wouldn't bank on people wanting to go to gyms when the ICUs fill up
PDD too hot to touch right now?
I'm getting fucking beheaded bro
yeah i have i think similar but 11/27- i really hope so dude!! i‚Äôll sell monday, i just wanna see a red day TODAY üò•
You big dumb then
Sold my NIO calls at close to high today ($51) and will ignore until after earnings. I have XPEV to look at instead!
Everyone making a killing on Chinese EV companies. Here I am getting bled dry by AMD/AMZN
Watching NIO go green to red like a mf strobe light on RH
Pdt applies to any trade regardless. I just got off my 90 ban
I probably sold them to you at the top. Thanks for buying
I think PTON had its day. Even with a new lockdown there‚Äôs a vaccine on the horizon. The best hope for PTON to match its summertime growth would be that China reopens those wet markets üò¨

what about xpeng? how do y‚Äôall feel about it?
Congrats to everyone who bought spy puts or calls, you‚Äôre both fucked.

Just pulled up a one week chart for AMAT 11/20 71c and it looks like total shit, am I missing something?
I understand that, hence what happened between yesterday and today. But i‚Äôm just pointing out the red day that‚Äôs all
[deleted]
No that would make it a 120 billion dollar company it‚Äôs not going to happen
[deleted]
I bought way back in 2015 +/- a year. Cost average is still sitting at 533. First investment I ever made. 20 shares. 

Funny thing is that I was weighing if I should make the 10k investment into Google or Amazon, and I figured Google would be better. I still got a winner, but I'd have about 100k now if I went for Amazon instead

Hold on
Hello again
He‚Äôs also got his reputation on the line. They‚Äôre not going to make a call without good evidence. Do you think you‚Äôve put more time into researching NIO than citron. Real talk. Plus they didn‚Äôt even really say it was a shit company. Only that it should‚Äôve gone up 1500% not 3000%. They had a fucking buy rating on it from 2 years ago.
interesting...i'm in
because idiots looked at a scary EPS and sold or took profit, it was down all of after-hours and in premarket

Getting bought up like candy; smart people see those new government army/healthcare/AI contracts and are like "Ooooo that's some juicy long-lasting partnerships"
I think this is a good entry point for atvi for a long hold (eoy). Looks like it might recover to 80 at least.
Praise be Chi lon Mak
The devices currently serve a useful purpose for neuroscience research. It‚Äôs already a multi hundred million a year revenue industry. The goal is to then to be able to implant in humans and influence the brain and fix ailments etc. that‚Äôs the long shot, but there‚Äôs already a business there as it stands today
Can someone stop NIO from trading for a day please so I know what to do
o ya
Brought back in at 44!! üí∞
AYRO
Should I take a loan out to buy more PUTS for NIO?
They invested in a fruit compknee
PDD jesus fucking christ, going huge AGAIN
Sounds like every grand I make then
You know... beeing invested in weekly puts ALL THE TIME means at some point the market will take and grant me 500% gains and i‚Äôll laugh at all the bulls (worth even more than the 500%)
Nah I theta ganged some FD's about an hour after open. Worked out v nicely

Nice gains bro
Cashed out on my NIO puts. But now I‚Äôm PDT restricted so I can‚Äôt buy more puts :(

I thought PDT only applied to margin? I was trading with my cash balance. Using TDA
O- is what NPR had said a week or two ago.

almost 300 mil in volume on NIO today. ridonkulous brah
[deleted]
[deleted]
BOEING PUTS!!!
down 80% on my NIO call down 30% eod calling it
If you feel any better I jumped the gun and sold @ $52. When I saw it hit hit 53, I was pissed (4% more, but on yolo margin that's 8%). But then it tanked, so...I guess that's part my fault.
Lol dude the company that did the report is obviously short selling. Please don‚Äôt be idiots.  buy the dip. Tendies for all
Said the same about Tesla, dunno bout destroyed that one. xD and Square XD
Whether you bought calls or puts today, you lose.
All the Iphone apps now want me to upgrade my phone. Apple got around the other planned obsolesce. Appl 180 EONY.
I‚Äôll be pulling out next week and watch. People are going to see their earnings and buy back in.
Right because you tards haven‚Äôt made bank on calls for months
SOLO puts & calls , leaps also.  Next 10 bagger
This sub is full of NioPets
Just fyi NIO is due for one more wave of selling or it will never make another new ATH. I'd sell anything near 50.
I'll jump on the 12/18 $21 train with you and take her for a ride.
Fuk me, back into NIO shares at $46
> debits

Plz explain, I'm dumb
Personally I do think Nio is overhyped and not worth it's current market cap, however Citron is sh*t..most of the company they short eventually goes to the moon. Looking at Tesla and Shopify. But hey maybe Nio Bulls can use this confirmation that their Nio shares will Mooooon!
L
To punish poor people for gambling
Me :)
Y‚Äôall need to wait till Monday to get in on NIO it could drop again to low 40s
Sorry, but no
Cuomo says parents should prepare for schools to be closed - learning by remote only - starting Monday. Likely at a minimum for the rest of November.
NIO has got you all frothed up like the fast zombies from I am Legend.
lol rip
It‚Äôs still a long way from a full recovery... i got a 45p for 11/20 when it like like 52 and some change.
What a moron. I mean he called nio Tesla‚Äôs rival for starters. And sold out when EV is JUST starting to take off world wide. Fucking idiot üòÇ
FOMO getting the best of you and you keep chickening out? You literally just had a day nio dip to buy in and you're still complaining about Chinese ev spam lmao
I was going through that phase back in like April and my wife asked how much a college class to learn another skill would have cost.  It‚Äôs the cost of education.
I bought 45p 11/13 yesterday and my dumbass saw the open and pissed my pants and pulled out before the big drop. Sometimes I wonder why I'm so dumb.
Sold up %2,000 so I guess I have paper hands
thank you kind sir
Eventually, you will see that it is you that is being scalped.
Is ATVI the most manipulated piece of shit in the market. Feels like institutions are just sucking on premiums and not letting this thing rise on good news days
Calls or puts
The day before closed lower than the day you are referencing.  AKA the market went up. Not surprised I need to explain this here. You are 3/4th correct though.
Big bois sick of getting ripped on NIO shorts. Gonna join strength & crush it. True story.
Whether you bought calls or puts today, you lose.
Oh my god im a fucking retard
eww blood outta the poop hole
My mom just returned hers. Gyms are open boy
>I don‚Äôt know shit about investing 

Yeah no shit, neither does anyone here. What do you think this is? Some pussy shit like r/investing??? Now get off your high horse and buy NIO calls
Just trade futures and make tendies
How is this denial of science?
Up 180% on my calls I bought last month. Just bought more leaps today. I‚Äôm in it for the long haul
Are you from the future when NIO bottoms at like $10 in a few months?
11/20 70c nio??
Think about it like a tsunami. An initial pull back, then a massive wave comes in, then a pull back to the sea.
[deleted]
Yes but what happened with DKNG is they missed earnings n went up. So if NIO beats earnings it‚Äôll go down. Simple inversing
You are a humorless piece of shit and I'm a king
Bro stop. The time to enter was Tuesday
I thought stonks only go up
There are risks to false positives as you said and I agree, there is a potential for super spreader's but I doubt it offsets people properly quarantining after a positive test. Even trump himself pulled it off and got treatment. With no test he would've shrugged it off as the flu like many others would have.
Another all time high on the portfolio today :) thanks LI puts, and zoom calls
Part 2 started
Should I send him an email telling him he cost me $xx?
Take the award and go in peace
The palantir train is still running.
yeah why the fuck is that even not allowed, not like i have enough money to manipulate the market, not like I'm even borrowing money anyway

wow TSLA IV has really fallen over these past weeks
Sold NIO calls at 8%, rode puts all the way down, sold at -5%,  bought longer calls and new hedge at -4%

I've never done something so retarded
Lol, same with a call earlier
dump after 12.30
You‚Äôre one of those gatekeeping queer‚Äôs ain‚Äôt you.
At $2?
Maybe because sub rules say no pumps and dumps?üòÇüòÇ
somebody hates money
I know the feelings
Nope 100 EOY
Down 3k today on NIO lol, wiped out all my gains yesterday
Everyone back to put buying apparently. Well retail anyway, large specs buying calls. Interesting.
Gratz on the break even too - big W for the ego there. Good shit
Poors can't afford those options
Nio dump part 2 incoming
:(
Yeah, everyone's comments are at 0, so its just one asshole lol
LOL
Lmao if you don't think he's trying to have people panic so the price crashes this guy obviously has alot invested in PUTS and didn't think NIO would hit over 50$
It‚Äôs over 1/30th of the ENTIRE US stock market. Okay champ. Do you.

You used to have to do actual days of research before even commenting on this sub or everyone would berate you. Now the people who barely understand options overwhelm the people who want to do DD. It's like the sub shifted from a blackjack card counting sub with craps on the side to a slots/scratchoff sub. We used to maximize profit in a risky way, not risk it all and sometimes profit. It's cool, though, there are some other subs now that still have some pretty good DD. And some comes around here along with the memes which is why I stay.

TL;DR the "we are just degenerate gamblers" bit used to be an in-joke, comparing us to boomer investors. It wasn't supposed to mean this is an actual gambling sub.
Seriously I need some help too lol
imagine if it got delisted lmao
If Steve Jobs was still ceo of AAPL, APPL would have bought TSLA years ago.

Andrew left probably didnt do enough DD on a growing industry, retard was wrong on pton, i guess you can legally manipulate a stock
Oof
RH is so bad. When I click on puts, it shows me calls unless I switch to puts again. That resulted in a 2k loss for me. Stupid fucks.
I gotta admit, I shidded myself a little bit last night..

The funniest part is the NOW is the time to pull the trigger on Tesla options.  IV is insaaaanely low.  Yet moths are attracted to garbage like LI options with 200 IV.
Don't buy options with no day trades, especially on something volatile like NIO...
Y'all NIO bitches staring at a DCB like "Oh yes, this is fine."
That $0.50 instant drill on SPY was kinda sexy. More
What u think nov 20 call option? They gonna rocket?
I'm so happy for this dip cause it'll make leap calls more reasonable on Monday.

Ok
Just get in now. It's not the top.
NIO my cortisol is too high please moon
I'm loaded, I think I underestimated the stupidity of the buyers. It's a hold sure, but not sure who is buying it back up after that exciting news
This isn‚Äôt nio confidence it‚Äôs a short squeeze lol
If it does, these 50c calls bought in the dip will print nicely.
Yes sir
You all were sucking citrons cock when they killed NKLA

I always downvote my own comments cuz my confidence weak af

Looks like you‚Äôre going to have to live with your decisions. I got out close to the top and switched to puts they‚Äôre still green but not by much
Got some nice wine glasses so we can drink our own piss?
idk i think they've seen their run up
Aye
I should have taken your advice man. Do you have any other picks you've been studying?
Had a buy order ready for NIO when it hit 45.00 at that dip. The second I'm about to hit confirm, my boss calls me over something so moronic. When I'm done I look up and NIO is at 49. Never again.
[deleted]
I was literally just getting on here to ask that, dumped all mine @ $52 and and eatin tendies.
No it cuz stock go up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
cause anticipation of moderna vaccine and jnj vaccine
If you sold your NIO calls, delete your trading account. You'll only lose if you sell off everytime you see a little red
I mean... I did tell you I lost all my money on Appl calls. Don't put too much weight in my opinion xD
Well this aged well....
üëÄ
here's the issue I'm running into with explaining to ppl. ok so I look at the numbers and visualize it. then just sorta see if shit like support and resistance breaks.

but I'm... not... sure... how to explain that to ppl. y'know? I don't have a sense of how to explain the specifics.

few of the ppl that see my reads have said that they started to make sense and they can see it so there's "something there" but I dunno how to properly teach it.

Sure, but elon isnt making radical changes here. Hes ignoring the stats on the test. It has a chance to give false negatives and he should know that. If he tests positive, its highly likely he has it and this "confused" tweet coming from a person known to be a "scientist" just helps muddy the waters. The truth he knows all this and muddying the waters is his goal becuase he just wants to reopen his factory and resume printing money

Thanks for the advice!
NIO back to $35 in next few months... probably wrong but my puts are printing so far

Hope so got NVDA
Abso-fucking-lutely.

They expire Dec 18th. I will sit on them, just wish I had waited and got in when it hit $45 instead of FOMO'ing at $52
I hope NIO range trades between 50-60 for a bit so I can shave some meat easily
Can you manipulate the market for an hour?
Maybe, big volume so lets hope

Nio dip was fake and gay
any NIO put holders? what do we do? i don‚Äôt have any more day trades :(
Knowing RH, they'll probably laugh at you.
I loved OSTK options in march. Lower volume. =)
If only I had enough money to buy that $44 dip lol... my average at 52 with 3400 shares even after I bought ‚Äúthe dip‚Äù
If you haven‚Äôt got out nio yet don‚Äôt be a dumb fuck this is the beginning of its bubble pop/reversal you made enough money now get out
What‚Äôs up
Welp, the Top is in on Li. Forgot about open order on 11/20 C's that I over paid for that executed. Fuk
Buying very little amounts as it drops, DCA. Just in case....don't want to be the tard saying "I should have bought" when it's $400

Everyone read the citron title - stock dumps

Everyone reads the actual article - stock pumps
everytime spy touches 356 it gets german suplexed.
volume trending up, earnings had upsides - 76% increase in product sales
Do you see where it says "Why are people homeless?" at the top of the meme? That's how you know this isn't a thread just about NIO. Poor gang rise up.
[deleted]
55 Strikes calls coming back to life. Only down -85% now!
Sounds good af gonna look into it maybe even as a long term 6-12 month investment
Stonks don‚Äôt always go up. NIO does.
$0.15 for SAVE 11/20 22.5c.  Pretty cheap lotto ticket.
Facts
Hold a single December 12/18 30p for every 2k invested, and an LK situation would leave you sitting nicely.
In general, calls are inflated in the morning, and decrease in value as the day goes buy. Even if the stock price goes up through the day, the option price can still go down
We‚Äôre closing at 50 flat today
Nio $35p next week free money?
I‚Äôm hesitant atm. Doesn‚Äôt scream bargain like $390/$380 do

GOOGL master race, you degenerate
if you want another, Im thinking AES. GE AND HLT going up, AES will to. I'm sure all these companies are unrelated, but they seem to have similar price actions.

But IM really thiking AES will hit $21 just cuz they had amazing earnings, on track for Full Year guidence, and have been undervalued from this nonsense affecting the market. Although, its not without risks, thats why i have 30 days to expiration mostly.

Fauci says end of 2020 for some people. We may have everyone vaccinated by summer 2021. Depends on how many successful vaccines we have.

He most definitely is not. He is a hype man who attracts and uses the real talent effectively. I worked on his Hyperloop project and the white paper he put out was a complete mess. Really flawed stuff. But the idea was good and the project was sexy and it attracted the real engineers.

Did anyone actually read that Citron piece? It's literally like 2 bullet points, one of which is just speculation on Tesla's Model Y price in China. And the second is *actually* just "It's oversold lol."

Every dip in tech is a buying opportunity.
What we‚Äôre your positions did you sell eventually
Just bought a call. Definitely selling before earnings
SOLO is a good play safer than the other EV companies I would let it pull back a bit and wait for a decent entry it‚Äôll be worth $8-10 by March 2021 with an organic growth not with all this hyperbolic shit we are getting from other EV companies that are riding the coat tail of NIO.

Exactly. By the time they put out these things their short position is already in and they are ready to close it. They then go long. Unless you get into puts immediately when it‚Äôs published, you are giving them free money.

Did you make this up? Good one

WSB is known to lag behind, and jump on a bandwagon when it's already up a hill. But hey who knows, it could keep going higher in these autistic times.
Can we just make a new sub for NIO so I dont have to sift through your trash plays to find comments on companies that aren't Chinese scams?
NIO 35 Tuesday. But. Will be 200 by like 2025
I have the shit touch. Sold my NVDA calls at the bottom, got fucked. Bought NVDA puts, shit keeps grinding up. FML
Might want to do some research and look at the targets they set in the past like SHOP at $60 and never even dipped below $100. Has nothing to do w pandemic
If NIO drills hard and into next week, imma be ah screwed.
it is not going to. bottom is in. 100%

Yeah just cause one company out of billions said that , that company equals NIO. What fucking horrible logic, don't address that everything you said in the post is also materially wrong.

Earnings between XPEV yesterday, LI today, and then NIO on Tuesday.
My FD NIO 50 p were worth a 10 bagger but I took profit early.  Oh well.  Green either way.
I've said that every single day this week

I just keep adding 2021 leaps, losing money while watching other shit stocks skyrocket.

SPX you poor fuck
People losing money when it‚Äôs green, red, and or grey. Not sure the point of your question. 

But I agree, the shills on the pump and dump of NIO on this thread gets old. It‚Äôll fall and a lot of people are going to have a surprised pikachu face. The company is literally no where anything like TSLA.
Xpev's constant movement from +5 to -3.60 is terrifying why do I own this company
Apparently not
Ah dang margin sucks

No but as I already said there would be nothing stopping him from hiring people to move to Mars on great contracts and then once they arrive, voiding those contracts and enslaving them.

I imagine he's more likely planning something a bit more Blade Runner than that but nothing good can come of a corporation operating as a government.

I love it.

I mean I'm bullish on NIO longterm but this valuation is crazy. They need to absolutely crush earnings to justify the current stock price
I was thinking this the other day and a second later scrolled passed one
Who bought that dip! Next stop...tendieland!
NIO going back up tho

Anyone keeping track of his sale disclosures? I know on IPO day he sold like 10k worth. Any action since?

The true smooth brains are the ones buying calls so close to expiry.

With that said, pls buy my call that‚Äôs close to expiry
This is great play
Fuck all of y‚Äôall. Losing hope on NIO already. Fucking pussy ass bitches. Everyone gonna cry again when it goes up again. SHUT THE FUCK UP AND BE PATIENT
Didn't the do a one time stock compensation as part of the IPO which accounts for that loss. Excluding the stock compensation i believe they made profit of $0.09 per share.
I own 3 and am also 42. Weird you equate intellect with property ownership, wealth has nothing to do with intelligence.

im sorry to keep bothering you but ik youre playing sq or at least looking at it. what are you thinking eod?
Not so sure about that because of how much is produced internationally.  Similar to what happens with oil where we source more internationally instead because costs go up due to environmental regulations.  

Might be really good long long term 5+ years as we tap those international sources but seems risky.

Honestly don‚Äôt know enough about where they are looking at mining to really quantify that risk.
I need it to not last the day lol

I‚Äôm sorry, I just wanted to get launched to space in a Chinese Tesla.

You open up a small business or hedge fund, you transfer money in there, pay yourself through there into a solo 401k with Roth characteristics(100% of income up to a specific number that is still high enough for a down payment), buy a house and a car under your solo 401k‚Äôs name, and use your company to pay for food, electricity, internet etc because it is a business expense. On top of that you can drop money into a health savings account, child savings account, and open a non profit organization to do some more funneling if you need to. Simple small things to meet your end goals.

Ah gotcha. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs showing I have -1 and -equity on it then. 

So once it gets closer to expiration, assuming it stays in the middle, the profit should go up? And then it‚Äôd be recommended that I sell (close) it once I get to %50?

Sorry if I should be getting this lol I‚Äôm a total noob. I decided to buy a cheapo one so I don‚Äôt hate myself when I do it wrong lol

I need a crazy pump to 51 at the least
The Chevy bolt did not do much for them. My point with the hummer is that they have less than a year to test and produce a vehicle that's supposed to be rugged. Most GM trucks and suvs go through at least a year of testing and since this is a brand new one I don't think they have the luxury to shorten it.
Chinese Musk?  I dunno, smells pretty Citrusy rn
Thats a good idea, doubling down saved my ass last week on amd.

Hmmm, failing retail store selling products moving increasingly to online delivery, vs EV company in China, which has made huge EV goals, and has an exclusive contract with the Chinese government?

People aren't all in on this off baseless hunches. (well obviously some are, but there are legit reasons to be super bullish on NIO)
Honestly fuck them some random telling me citron is shit is all I need to decide that I‚Äôm diamond handing this
By mango, there‚Äôs a hit out on Gyna companies, and which one has been the most profitable...
I‚Äôm OK with that. 

Positions:
Sold 11/13 $51C
Buy 11/27 $47C

This drop just ensured I don‚Äôt have to exit my long position early. I was giddy as I watched my short position go from $3.60 to $0.22.
Yea NIU is a real solid play with an actual business model that will work long term.  It sort of falls with these EV bubble pure momentum plays but should not.  It is an actual business with a legit future.
Least you didn‚Äôt buy Nio at 54 like some clowns here lol 

What‚Äôs the pump from anyway
i want to just fucking kill Past Me for doing all this retarded shit with actual money before figuring out a set of strategies that i can live with.

fucking around with penny stocks on pumps

trying to play earnings with fucking SHARES because i didn't know about options

i'm much less retarded than i once was, but it's come at a cost.

also i'm still pretty retarded

Agreed, the degree is much worse with these investment research firms as their claims are completely baseless and subjective.

Wall street analysts will use key metrics to craft their analyst to influence where the price will go.

One uses a sophisticated method, the other brutish.
Yup. The capital needed is significantly higher but I‚Äôm very happy with PLTR right now

No clue my dude. You can't play this stock off technicals as it has gone full retard and is one of the top meme stocks right now. I could see it settling in the mid 40's for the day as lots of folks appear to be collecting profits prior to earnings.

no worry - your chance is coming....
Read their SEC filings!  I know it's a long boring read, but they spell it out very clearly.

NIO Co. Ltd ($NIO) is a Cayman Island holding company.  They only own 50% of the PRC subsidiary (NIO Energy Automobile Co., Ltd) which is their "revenue generator".  Since $NIO is a "foreign company" to PRC, they don't actually have any control over the company that makes their product.  It's a house of cards.  One wrong move and it all falls apart.

However - nobody bothers to do their homework before investing, so the price is currently being propped up by unicorn farts and hope.  Jump in and enjoy the wild ride, but don't stay in it for very long.
So why hold your puts if you know it‚Äôs done going down? Lmao ü§°ü§°ü§°
Fuck you Tim Apple you silly stupid fuck. :(
That's bc, gasp, you are reading from sources that come from a country that has an active incentive to keep smearing china as inherently inferior. Did we forget about nikola already?

Fucking Applied Materials (AMAT).  You're my baby.  Absolutely DESTROYED earnings with a record breaking quarter, and the CEO stated wrt forward guidance:

"Our future opportunities have never looked better and, as powerful technology trends take shape, we are uniquely positioned to accelerate our customers' road maps and outperform our markets."


Meanwhile all the kids here chase after dog shit like NIO and LI options with 200+ IV.  lol.  $70 calls on AMAT was virtually free money with way lower risk.
Look at the money flowing out of MSFT And apple
If you played trades perfectly, you'd have all the money in a couple of days.
Be patient. Will not last through next week.
Lot's of Bear traps being set.
When I commented it was taking a nose dive but it's indeed going up again


But why is the opinion of one man the reason for NIO to drop?

Who the hell is pumping nio now?
The way you've described it, it sounds like you're selling the iron condor (i.e. you receive credit as long as the underlying stays within 84-70).

If that's the case, you can close out your position by buying back the iron condor you sold.  You won't get max profit unless you let it expire, but typically rule of thumb is that you want to buy back at 50% profit.
If I had calls on SPY, that triple top would have me sweating a bit.
People thought 22 was the top, then 27, then 35, then 40, then 45, then 50. I'm sure there's plenty of folks who made 400 - 500% on puts that are 90% down. And no one is getting 2500% on a stock with IV that high.

How are bears even alive

You know something is wonky when you can buy ITM calls below their intrinsic value.  Almost like the NIO call holders can't afford to execute.  Thanks guys.

Do NOT buy the dip yet NIO isn't done dropping
Today has been a cycle of lower lows and lower highs
No only up you stupid ignorant bearish motherfucker
Is TSLA dead
I really wish he did not infect the astronauts who are traveling to the ISS tomorrow.
Is spy gonna do the most predictable dip ever... or...?
And we‚Äôre back
At least they didn‚Äôt do it AH.
Yes, run from your Chinese EVs back into the arms of baba.
Shakin all u pussy hands out, robbin ur premiums on short dated calls, and letting the true soldiers go to battle, see you at 100 by summer 2021

Nio options so much premium, literally more than spy options. Bruh
Fuck I just took losses on NIO and now I‚Äôm certain it‚Äôll reach 52. Fuck I should‚Äôve doubled down
Im hoping for a dip of 79~80 today to hop back in.

Lol I was trying to be a little sarcastic but hard to make that come across over a screen. CLEARLY this guy shouldn‚Äôt be playing with options.

Love to see that Robinhood will approve anyone and everyone for options trading.
"No!" I feel ya

Someone make this same meme but instead of calls say puts
Oh and TSLA lost money for about idk 8 years?
NIO about to pass average volume already. Will probably hit half a billion
I tried that the first time. But it went from negative one to negative eleven
This aged well
Fuck yes buy the dip, it's on sale
The market always trails covid reality. Chicago literally shutting down and hospitality stocks are up. Grab some puts dated early 2021 and wait. Bet against NIO via puts on LI. LI is the Litecoin of the Chinese EV pump.
Lol wat. They've bounced 10% in 13 mins.
This shits the same thing as Turo isn't it?

Its like soneone kicked my portfolio off a cliff
Uncle Biden and Uncle Xi gonna MOON our calls with Orange Man on his way out.
I figure NIO will settle to the max pain level for 11/13 option holders of right at 50 for today.  Typical expiration Friday, but I think it will have some room to run on Monday and Tuesday.
Aged like milk. Ok, this comment might do so too.
How about now?
I think long-term it's still a really solid play. Just going to suck for a little bit.
Yeah or most likely a few days before just depends how in the middle it is.
Thanks for the heads up, calendar hard.
I know with Sony they only made the PS5 available as a pre-order. No in store stock on launch.
DKNG headed on back down to 42
Smh got killed by a lemon üçã
SPY is so gay
Spy is for boomers learn how to take some fucking risk in your life. See Nio up 17% on Thursday go all the fuck in on Friday
Imagine thinking NIO was fucked
Holy shit I should‚Äôve went w my guy on NIO. Mooned on XPEV earnings and ranked on LI. Their earnings is RICED IN
Was pissed I sold my NIO $50c for February that I bought yesterday on the dip and sold at $53.60, then seeing it moon to $54.20.


The good news is that I am no longer pissed about the decision.
These posts always get made when NIO dips. Then when it goes up 10% again you will never ever see these posts
People forgot we still have earnings next week. We‚Äôll be alright.

Not allowed to make money September-???
Yep, they failed to give guidance last earnings (which would've moved the stock up as it should have at that point in time).

Insider trading activity showed all sells, no buys for that quarter.  
I don't think I'll be trading DKNG going forward, I seem to only make the wrong decisions on this company.
I hope for your sake it's correct because nio has years of work to even approach tesla
seeing Tesla be red all week and not even attempt to recover really scares me
Hahahaha I hope it does, shit
Short bus certified
Oh have enough liquidity for another full year of operations without needing to raise capital too if you take a simple look at financial statements.
Who gives a shit about grammar on Reddit? I mean even your (happy?) reply has at least 3 errors in it.
Can't they just..talk?
Yeah,  thankfully I sold only a few minutes after the peak after I knew it wasn't a brief dip. Had I sold at the tip,  would've been around $6200 account balance,  so lost out on $700 or so but glad I secured my gains either way

ah ok cheers dont follow it even though i have puts....long dated, figure its gonna recalibrate and when it does im ready
I‚Äôm still up substantially, but damn that still hurt. Seeing your position after the price plummets 13% in 30 minutes always hurts, even if still green.
If it makes you feel better, I lost all my money on Appl calls so was only able to put in $500. So my 75% gain is more of a moral victory.
Nio running outta steam

NIO being all over the place today isn't too bad when you bought 11/20 20C for $3.14 a piece in September.

ü§£üòÇ
Sure but they have valid points. 20+x NTM sales, 50x LTM sales is a bit ridiculous - TSLA even with such monopoly power did not achieve this with everything it can offer + MUSK
If they crush earnings their price is utterly fucked. How many times do you need to see it this year to get the message?
God I was just bragging about my puts and now NIO is bouncing
gotta love these red-ass green days
Oh I will I just wanna know why the dip lol. Sold nio yesterday gonna get back in later.
Hahaha glad I could help
From ? Into?
Valhalla or hell for me. I have Feb 55 calls that I'm gonna hold through earnings no matter what
damn...was hoping for ZM to drop a bit lower so I could double up on cheap calls
Tyty, here's hoping
I bought nio puts at open at 0.20 and sold later for 0.30 now they are worth 1.86 lmao fml missed out on a 10 bagger
Buy it up
155+ battery swap stations too
Tesla calls
FSR 20 by eod please and thank you.
If that actually prints.. i will shet brick

Already on it. Time to go full retard mode
Yep, look how fast its bouncing back. Scary, but earnings is just around the corner, no where to go but up.
Two biggest names in the stock market getting rotated out of means nothing...
Looks like those NIO put whales yesterday are making moves
How can a company with a forward PE of 25 and 700million active fusiliers have a stock price that tanks, you ask?  Communism! And it‚Äôs coming soon to a government near you.

And yet until the Citron article was published NIO was up double digits % today. Gtfo
BABA hitting support at $258. If it breaks through it could really crash hard. :/

Failing that, if it holds this is a good time to buy in/more.
Just yolo'd everything I have left on gnus 1.5$ calls 11/20. Hopefully the big diesel attracted a lot of new viewers
Yep I sold mine and bought back in for a 58$ call
Citron research is no better or worse than wall street analysts.  
They're all manipulators looking for personal gain at the cost of ignorant retail investors.
I‚Äôm confused about how to claim profit on an iron condor.

Do I need to let it expire to receive the credit?

For example, I buy an iron condor for AMD, credit for 0.76 ($76) at $84 -$70

If I let the condor expire and it‚Äôs between $84-$70 will I get the $76 dollar profit? Or do I have to sell it prior to expiration to get the profit?

Very cool!
After watching NIO for 2 weeks this what we call that the morning dip, load up whores
I don‚Äôt like when people give misleading information on Reddit. When people are posting an obvious pump move I have no issue with railing them for promoting their own pump if it is about to be sold off(no point in promoting an overnight day trade because few people will wake up at 9:00 et to trade or 7:30 et to check news and premakarket trading). Sorry if I come off as assholeish, but I will do anything to help others, including railing on people to dissuade others from making poor investment decisions. Again sorry, don‚Äôt mean to be a complete asshole. Just don‚Äôt want people making the wrong investment decisions for the wrong reasons without an exit plan.
So much dip. So much dip

If youre selling NIO rn, you were holding for the wrong reason

down 4400 today i am numb
I posted this yesterday. Consider an at-the-money put on BUD and TAP. Both are at, or very close to, their post-Covid crash highs. BUD in particular has had a big spike this week. I can't say that we're about to go into a lockdown, but we might be looking at something close to it with the rapidly rising case count. Bars, restaurants and clubs closed, alcohol sales down, you know.
2 years ago Citron research did the same shit with shopify when it was $70 per share and now its at $923.00. Fuck them and don't paper hand your calls. Earnings are still Tuesday, and plenty of room to run before 100. They did this more than once with tesla and look at it now over 2K pre-split.

Yep. Expect an end of day surge. Folks will be bitching on Monday that they should‚Äôve bought more today
Yeah ok cya at 60 next Friday pussboy
Kind of dipped already to 74 last week.

Edit:77 not 74
Anyone important scheduled to speak today?
fomo on the li dip getting me. Sold at 35.
Another bullshit sideways SPY day? 
Whatever spy puts holding over weekend
lmao bud do you live under a rock
Lmao all these retards panicky selling when nio drops by 5% after climbing 100%. And it‚Äôs recovering currently lmao
nm, sold for tiny profit. nio is clear for mooning again
As it goes back up... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Bought PLTR at the dip
NIO dump is the MMs shaking out the retail retards
Who the fuck gives a shit about citron? Fuckin french morons
Sold my puts at the bottom of that dip. Made my tendies for the day.
Solo ü§û
Let the rocket begin
I bought puts at 353 yesterday. It won‚Äôt move until they expire and then crash to 300.
that the bottom?
Citron just mad they losing money while we‚Äôre cooking up crispy tendies
-3.6k in 8 minutes
People bitch about manipulation all the time on this sub when it‚Äôs literally smack dab in their face. 

Citron ‚Äúpulls the plug‚Äù after NIO rises all week after the other EV hit all their numbers with NIO primed to do the same. 

They released their BS report to get in cheaper before it rises even higher. 

Literally RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. There‚Äôs your manipulation boys. 

Feel free to buy puts though.
Is this the bounce before we drill to the core?
Oh yeah. Super deserving. (Not /s)
NIO 60 next week is already priced in
[deleted]
NIO Dip or PLTR Long
Dunno; the entire "losing face" culture of the Chinese almost demands a much more significant punishment imho.  Don't think the CCP can back down from one of the richest Chinese citizens calling them out.
Rip 11/13 exp put holders. Shoulda sold yesterday like me. What were you thinking you greedy fucks? Now suffer
[deleted]
WTF IS KEEPING SPY UP
I already made 50%
Big brain plays. Wsb retards thought it was going up another 20% today lol.
Sold
Correct way is to emphasize the low market cap you could have gotten in at. Share price meaningless.
Got damn I can‚Äôt wait for NIO er on Tuesday. Going to be legendary
why is noone talking about nio
Got fuckin annihilated by nio... If solo and tesla dont make up for it next week i very well may give up
i have no stake in it. im just banking on the fib retracement.
It‚Äôs barely 1 hr 30 mins into trading day lol
Buddy I‚Äôm 17

My TSLA spread is already down 37%. Fuck you.

Nothing matters if you‚Äôre a market sweetheart! See Unity for reference
All Chinese EVs going back up NIO will end where it did yesterday
FSLY 100c jan and TLT weeklies, going to be my next paperhands -70% play
(takes deep drag on joint) Do you know what it's like to be responsible for the death of an innocent Iraqi civilian in war? It leaves a crack in your soul that never heals. 13 years since I came back from Fallujah, and I'm still homeless. Got this motel room roof over my head for another month, by the grace of God, and precious little funds left for food. Beyond that, it's up to my option plays to pay the rent. I got a 1540 on my SAT, 800 verbal 740 math. I could've gone to fucking Wharton, but my parents declined to spend money on my university education while simultaneously expecting me to go to college. Fucking Trump dodges the draft, cheats on the SATs, bribes his way into Wharton, and still gets an honorary graduation from my Air Force Academy ... why are Americans homeless? You could've been the one to go to war and kill an innocent man, you could've been the one to bear the burden of national defense. I could've stayed home and made money, looked after my own interests. We need a two year term of mandatory military service for all Americans aged 21 years, so that the selfish rich stop shirking the burden of national defense, so that we have no more non-warrior non-veteran draft-dodgers for Commander-in-Chief, and so that Americans no longer ask "why are people homeless? Why don't they just pull themselves up by their bootstraps?" Americans are socialists when it comes to sending other people to war on their behalf, and rugged individualistic capitalists when it comes time to share with the combat veterans who fought for them.
low vol sq 2% drop? i raise you 5% lower vol moon
Nio 40 by close today
Hope all ya autists already sold all them NIO $50C you were bragging about

This is why I bought my put yesterday haha
Going back up rn btw. This shit is bipolar af
Told y‚Äôall. My NIO puts ate, done for the day! Thank to those who overbought NIO!
Sold all my RKT calls at the top this morning. Feels good to time something correctly.
NIO back at close last night and everyone is panicking..
I remember quad witching that was a shitshow
Y‚Äôall are fucking retarded
palantir theta gang kinda easy, also guys peep fb and google, they will moon once this F@Q market stops being so fucking gae
Brother!! Enjoy! I‚Äôm
 Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nio opens 39 tbh
The fuck nio, I‚Äôm just shocked
NIO puts
Nio is so unpredictable, from free fall to stabilised
Get on the NIO train were retards we know what to do
Are you fucking kidding me SPY
But pltr and all other EV is down what's the reason?
ZM dip
Buy the ZM and PTON dip
Will it keep going down tho? It‚Äôs hitting an upswing right now. Perfect time to buy a put before it keeps descending.
I think I‚Äôve seen this one before
Nio leap holders that sold some premium are the real winners
RemindMe! 2 weeks
she go back **up**
Yeah he's not that bad. He makes her happy ü•∞
Nio calls and puts are both up today by 20% üòÖ
Yeah, this didn't go great for me... but all I see is an opportunity to double down.
It's up 1% this week. So many better plays this week
As someone holding RKT since July/August, I can tell you from experience that your best option is to cut your losses and try to jump into a winning trade. The person that said prepare to empty your pockets is correct, you will probably need to make a deposit to try again.
Put 500 into SOLO. What kind of FD can I do with the last 100
Hold, your expiry makes sense
Earnings
It‚Äôs so funny to see all the people that sold NIO and were bragging on here just few minutes ago ü§£ I bet now they‚Äôre buying again. Such a behavioral finance
That dip was like A1 steak sauce for these tendies. Mmm.
Dip and then rip! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
bro they are around the price tesla was years ago before tesla came up to the thousands and then split. if you didn't invest in tesla when it was this cheap and regret it, now is a good time to make up for that. FOMO is more or less, bullshit, at this point. I would say that NIO is a bit more volatile than Xpeng
My god I do love my gut instinct. Set a buy order for PLTR at 15. Dipped to 14.88 and bounced straight back up. We about to eat good tonight
lmao i feel so good for selling $LI at market open today.
Last time I did that everyone lost money on Tesla earnings and everyone was making fun of my play as an autistic way of having cold feet. I ended up making money going both ways off of weeklies while everyone else lost money. Leverage is worth losing a little money over in order to guarantee profits either way. +50% is more than the degenerates on here.
NIO you beautiful bastard ü•∞
Just loaded up on 70c 11/27 it‚Äôs literally free money
Nah
[deleted]
Ye ive ran into that problem before RH only lets me make 3 day trades inna week

From down 10% Nio to up 20%now ü§ë
NIO back to $50 by 1 PM.
You missed out already
they were bullish when it was at 7$ not 50!
Gotta love the beginnings of a V
Id let it dip some more, not a bad play though.

I sold my calls expiring today near the top. Then waited a bit, bought some expiring next week. Then it dropped off a cliff ü§°. I was telling myself to wait on buying them till later in the day, but FOMO grabbed me by the balls.

+1000$ in 2 minutes
But I‚Äôm also a pussy
If SPY breaks through the triple top on the 1m chart then nothing is sacred anymore
Bro if nio comes back today I‚Äôll pour one out for the homie, sorry bra
I perfectly timed the nio bottom and sold when it was 6% lol fuck me
Now buy the dip retard
Buy the Tesla dip and thank me in Q4
Any moron thinking citron just crashed the future of EV with one stupid article is insane üòÇ

No u get made fun of showing off ur girlfriend on reddit
LOOLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Shocked to see NIO sell off when literally every single comment is a bot or fish talking about it.
Feel you, LI at $39
Today shows that luck might be the biggest factor in options trading. Or maybe insider information.
I‚Äôll explain since some ppl are confused. Yes its just one downgrade. But citron called nio 30+ back when it was trading at $1. They said the entire market ‚Äúwas missing something‚Äù. Now that very same company is saying it‚Äôs too high. That‚Äôs why everyone is selling. Whether they‚Äôre right or not idk. But they have a track record.
Buy the FSR dip phagoots!!
Lol idiots. They shoulda sold at open. Luckily I sold all my calls at the top and kept my cheap put that I bought yesterday and just sold that at what's hopefully the bottom.
goddamned idiots lol you could see the panic setting in. be patient
You going to insult NIO like that? 70 eod ez
WERE BACK!!!
Oof
253 million volume already on the day for NIO. Fucking nuts
NIO BIC DIC BULLS BAC
I have 100 shares and it‚Äôs pissing me off
Yess
You‚Äôre right, calls and puts both up right now
!remindme 24 hours
I think citron is in here and got annoyed of all this nio talk everyday
Downvote Danny is out again
this is exactly why i'm just never buying options less than 30 days out again

buy some 1/15 or later calls on PLTR at this price and you won't regret it
Who‚Äôs downvoting all these comments? Who‚Äôs account is getting fukd?

What does this do, is it that it sets a stop loss after it reaches below a limit that you set?
  If NIO does a heroic V shape recovery I won‚Äôt do anything crazy but I will be happy
Remember, stonks only go up. NIO will recover
Nio won‚Äôt recover today sorry guys
They are waking up and buying as we speak
Fuck this guy

That NIO intraday swing is wild as fuck
We betrayed Elon :(
Who bought Nio this morning? Gawd damn
Holy shit Nio crashed to *checks notes* 1 day low
I sold my XPEV puts earlier like an imbecile
Not too late to get on NIO put train.
NIO dip was fake news
Well all the gains I‚Äôve made on NIO I‚Äôve just lost.

So I‚Äôm back to where I started
Guy in the research report said ‚Äúwe are looking at...and an investor base more interested in spinning a casino wheel‚Äù. He called y‚Äôall out lmao. His new price target is 25 after Citron was bullish for two years. Gg wp
Someone wake up the NIO bulls! üò≥üò≥

Hold the doooorrrrr!!!
What are we buying to prep for this second wave of carona, because shit is giong to shut down again very soon.
I sold my NIO at eod yesterday.... saw that shit mooning in the Big Y parking lot this morning when I bought that orange sprinkle cheese for popcorn.  Was so close to adding some FOMO positions but didn't.  Maybe this will be a cooling-off day and I'll look again Monday.
Citron decides NIO pricing is unjustified and said it makes zero sense for anyone outside of China to buy NIO stock when we're not buying into the company but papers with three letters.
I‚Äôm retiring from money
Dip complete
Loss porn or mass bans!
Bruh why you only have $100 in 1980s money in your account. Gotta pump those numbers up
V actually doing a V
Thank fuck I woke up to sell my positions a bit after open

Aye fuckers you better buy this dip cause I bought the top
You think I should‚Äôve sold at it‚Äôs peak earlier? Now that it‚Äôs down right now I‚Äôm kind of bummed
just the weekly friday dip folks, nothing to see here
If you aren't invested in pick and shovel weed stocks you are missing out on some tendies.
Nio dropped like a fat bitch trying to ice skate
Their cd rates were higher than any major bank other than Ally. I can just transfer money out of my cd after I close it into a different account and back in with a new amount and it is considered ‚Äúnew money.‚Äù I have more than 1 bank account.
Just wish I help my insurance puts and waited to buy more calls a little longer. Damn that dip was perfect opportunity üòÇ citron just made a lot of people a lot more money. But cucked most
Spy chart looking like the Himalayas
Every NIO candle is 1%, this shit is wild

That was it. Load up on calls

Perhaps I might get my money back, at least.
Okay the pussies left nio, time for the men to buyüòà
Lol. Keep saying that.
Where‚Äôd you hear about it? Took some fat NIO gains and was trying to figure the next play since I knew this autistic strength would falter
Rip to NIO call holder who took a break after seeing 54$
I hope you bought the dip.
Lost everything I had in that shit fuck you Citron. Closed me out and I‚Äôm down 80%
So glad I went boomer with nio today and just had shares
I was up +20k at the beginning of market hours and now at -15k. Guh
NIO ON THE DIP PUSSIES
Typical Friday.  See you bitches Monday at 55.  ü•±
Just get cucked and PUT and order that is below midpoint
Nio if you hit 44 me buy back and love you long time
i made great plays this week only to get rocked by sq. dont know if i should hold these 185c 11/20

They never dropped below $100 Citron is a scam
This an OTC trade. Doesn't get the same action as stocks in the usual US indices. I wouldn't be tossing $400 worth into this company even though it's penny stock level. You're free to shoot this stock if you got free money laying around since it seems like this company was listed a year or two ago.
So easy, why does anyone work for a living
volume on nio is fucking retarded
Hold long term you'll be okay, maybe some turbulence but you'll end up on top. Set a stop loss for 35$ if you wanna play safe
Second dead cat bounce
NIO TO THE MOON

Hello - ama

This is going to be my biggest win since ROKU

I was 2x on my NIO puts while the underlying was higher than when I bought them. God I love options
Eh those are a few lottery tickets i got for like 20 bucks total, no biggy
i expect a NIO bounce at 44ish
Not at all.  It's OK to be envious ü§£

I sold another 166 contracts at 25 cents for a nice basket of tendies.  

I'm gonna ride the final 200 of them right into the ground if I have to.
Anddddd we're back
Watch NIO run back up to $53 EOD and all you clowns hating will buy at the top *again*. It‚Äôs going to be glorious.
NIO is brutal like that neighbor with 10 inch cock fucking every housewife in the block
Good man I think everyone‚Äôs did!
XPEV recover started already too
Shorts just shorting. It‚Äôs gonna go back up 15% in 30 minutes.

Fuck I take my losses and NIO goes up again

You guys fucking owe me
Wow PLTR fuck you and fuck this
I was waiting for this to happen so I can buy :)))
Because its the future of EV, should be near TSLA valuation
you mean +20%
[yes](https://i.imgur.com/xbbKT33.png)
pton wrecked me
Rotation
You were saying?
*+20%
Why should they wait til it's completely built before announcing it? Probably a lot smarter to announce it and see what the reaction is.

> why didn't they invest in the EV game sooner?

Have you not heard of the Chevy Bolt? They've been in EVs but it's a lot of cash to spend if they're all in too early. They have to balance that expenditure with their existing ICE business.

Same.. and now it's continuing to drop
Yeah I missed out on being my portfolio back to the green by being a little fucking bitch. Never again
Bought 1 NIO $50C EOD yesterday for $77

Sold at the top for $400

Only about $7k more to go to make up for my qUaD wItChInG losses back in March
i hate when papa spanks me
[deleted]
Nothing's dead until your account says $0
i‚Äôm in for shares at $40, you think i‚Äôll be good?
 13 days of NNN and I'm getting rock-hard just when water hits my shaft, FML
Jump back in on nio
What the fuck is keeping NQ green. Sheesh
You may be freakijg right. 10%down in about an hour... Thats heavy.
The prophet speaks
Way of the road bubs! Time to lock up and reload üòé
Soooo is NIO taking a nap or has it been cut in the jugular?
NIO gonna crush earnings and y‚Äôall are getting shook out. Got myself a 45C next week for 5 bucks
The stock is up 120% in a month... you didn‚Äôt need to have inside info to gamble on puts
so cash gang now...my gut says just wait to rebuy til end of day...
[deleted]
So glad I sold my shit earlier today when it hit its peak üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My lottery tickets hit!
This morning I reposted the Citron report and pointed out that WSB re re's always end up bag holding. The response was basically "shut up we're making money and its going to the moon"

Since then its down 15%
NIO call holders, the smoothest of all brains. You deserve to lose all your money if you held that overbought garbage
Just buy puts and sell at the bottom and use that money to buy calls
did anyone make 10 baggers on ev puts just now?
Good call... flip a coin and you‚Äôll be right half the time. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è enjoy the tendies.
https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NIO-Citron-Pulls-the-Plug.pdf
Posted this in another post but here's my story this morning. How I missed my first 10 bagger.

Bought 49p expiring today after I saw it break below my trendline for the second time with a fat red candle. Was watching the charts and everything looking good. Then, a sudden need to shit hits me like a truck. I rush to the bathroom. I'm watching it on my phone but I can't see my TA charts. I see NIO popping back up and I panic. I sell off. After I'm done with my shit, I come back to look at my charts and my heart sinks. I shouldn't have sold. It didn't hit my stop loss. Now I'm sad. My 10% gain could've been a 5 bagger possibly more if this continues. It's way ITM now as I'm typing this.
 I just got in on solo an hour or so ago which is now shitting on me but thank fuck it wasn't nio
I was up 70% now down 50%
No...maybe people just thought nio wasn‚Äôt a top four valued automaker in the world lol. I‚Äôm sitting on a ton of $40 11/13 lotto puts I bought ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.
Lol good luck with that, you should have bought them at open
Wish I had more conviction. Made only 100% on 0DTE NIO 51 puts, they are up over 600% now. Damn it. I'll never get rich
Yeah.  I'm seeing December calls still up.
Just bought NIO puts, your welcome in advance.
[deleted]
STOP THE COUNT!
Sell that shit
for the time being...
Man this didn't age well at all
Panic sell off is not lasting long, very obvious the dip is being bought for NIO at $45.
[deleted]
And then you see it's still green guh
I got NIO calls dated for 11/27 , by the time I'm ready to sell,it'll be at 55
Wtf is up with xom being so resilient today
[deleted]
GUH
[removed]
DAL having a nice day.
Lol no
Imagine having the power to drop stocks with a single Tweet (legally). Citron Research has it made lmao
That was easy money, like buying NIO puts !! Lol
SPG is bipolar.  +8% Monday, -7% yesterday, +7% today.  I'm long, writing CCs.  Stressin me out man
SORRY WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED

hahahah who tf is buying nio back. we never learn eh
Agree. Just hold through it. It'll come back
üòÇüòÇ fr basically flipping a coin at that point
Rotation back into America
Trying to get paid today, not 5 years from now
How much did you just lose after the Citron article?
$100 swings on the dow every 5 minutes, sure. Not shaking out the IV AT ALL
oooooh. is NIO going to do the TLRY thing? exciting!
No way NIO drills all the way to the 30s, this ship is taking off any minute
I know, I can never time the top right. Nice work though
Citron was just jealous they missed out
It was at $53 something around an hour ago. I actually thought about buying puts but decided not to. Still kinda glad I didn‚Äôt because this one is so unpredictable
YES FALL PLTR ITS OVER!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE THE HIGHER GROUND
I loaded up on some shares this AM and bought a single 12/4 $57c at open. Thankfully I did a quick in and out with the call which offset the loss I took on the shares before jumping ship lol
I wonder how fast NIO gets back to 50 after this game is over.
grats and off, I'm crying
Lol I guess the party is over
Eurotraders getting screwed as usual
[deleted]
are we bearish over the weekend?
Fuck dude. Time travel back a couple hours is all you need to get rich. Sheeesh
NIO -20% EOD
"yolo on solo" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
NIO gotta close the gap from yesterday, I‚Äôm gonna get fucked on my puts not selling here aren‚Äôt I
Wow, I really timed the NIO top. Too bad I only bought a single call.
Fake dump. Reversal will be eod and back to mid 50's by Monday. I'm holding my dec calls. fuck Citron and Fuck NIO bears.
11/20 $200C maybe a cheap lotto not sure I‚Äôd be cautious
Any updates about your retardation diagnosis?
**Reporting for duty, SIR!**
[deleted]
NIO is down 6% and you guys are acting like it's gonna go back to $20 a share. You don't deserve gains
This aged well
so high barrier of entry explains why ppl haven't figured it out.
Lock in NIO.
Positions or ban
[deleted]
Time to buy more.
Atm leaps are the safest
Make sure you look up what an actual short squeeze is. Short % or float isn‚Äôt even 2% as of two weeks ago. Might pop, but not a squeeze
just bot nio 50 c for next week, but it's probably fuct
Citron? More like Shitron
shouldve took gains but i didn't so i guess im holding now
BUY THE DIP
I fucking hate myself brio
[removed]
volume is insane on NIO. i still think this pushes higher closer to earnings and it's whales taking profits
OH! PLUG is also falling off a cliff! Meme reckoning day?
Imagine being a NIO bull, going to smoke some weed and beat off to celebrate your tendies, and then you come back and see this epic GUH.
Careful, Cintron and Hindenburg like to run trains. Just when you get comfortable with that thing lodged in there you gonna get the DP
Maybe you are, but I am going to beg you go keep your genitals to yourself regardless. I'm sure they're very large or tight or whatever you consider a compliment.
Patience dude.
Visa is the number one credit card in the world and literally always post consistent gains... take out a little ago when it dipped to 187 range
[removed]
I sold but talking for the rest of wsb‚ò†Ô∏è
Any news on NIO?
No need to be alarmed in the EV space. It just a rotation from NIO to NKLA. EV investors are in the idea business. They don't like EV companies that actually make cars.
Also this is super healthy for NIO like long term players know whats up
I'm with ya pardner ü§†
NIO 34.5P 12/4 up 130% today, always inverse WSB
[deleted]
So did I, but then I bought back in when I thought we reached the bottom. That‚Äôs when NIO was at +6% üòÇ
What nio ending at today
ah yes, the climb back up begins. only retards sold
Damn. Big Dick Nick in the chat
Dude has been on a tear past few months! Good luck. I hammered him in the match for 1st round against Rory at like -130 lol
Just did. Will rinse wash and repeat next week.  New robinhood users are a curse and a blessing.
How can crayons do so much with so little?
Bought Nio calls at open and sold for %50 profit at the top just to lose it buying shares at $50 :)
You hanging in there bud?
A very rough drop to stomach losing so many imaginary thousands in such a few minutes..... but as we all know these momentum plays can swing back just as quickly.
My nio calls are still up 4.5% on the day lmao wut
Glad I sold Nio time to buy back in when it open at 39 or some shit
It‚Äôs just profit taking next week will be fine
It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm that guy
Spy is giving me fucking whiplash
Citron posted an article saying NIO is only worth half what it was trading for.
I paper handed every single fuckin play this week fuuuuukkk
Imagine believing listening to citron research is in your best interest
Guys...i'm not impressed with everyones calls on NIO

What is our next play...give me some ideas!!
So......NIO 54 EOD?

Haha jk I'm fucked
TOP is in good bye chad bulls üçå
NIO FLOOR 45.

MOONS from here.
Not trying to rub it in, but look at the 6 month chart and ask yourself why would you buy lmao
After 70 of that is gone for taxes no you literally can‚Äôt buy a nice house for 100k in the majority of the country. You wrong dawg
What were your gains today?

I dont feel as retarded now for buying nio puts
Someone knew this Citron report was coming out, there were a ton of 11/13 puts bought up yesterday

You think that matters when everyone has been putting their life savings in, they see 40? the buy back will be massive
Okay I missed out what happened to chinese ev and most of tech today?
Only 30 more dollars down to go and it will be at a reasonable valuation!
I was right!!!!
Algorithms will not let it fall. Prob going to trade flat all day.
like I don't have a proper instruction manual for how I do shit. I just don't have links that say "here read this and it'll all make sense" or some shit. gotta explain it to ppl in my own words.

Yup bye bye nio it was fun while it lasted. Back to being poor.
AMD calls if it drops to around 74 again, otherwise im staying out
What was the consensus on shop back then? Corona clearly helped them out alot.
BTFD nio
WSB called the top yet again...
What were you saying again?
I feel bad for whoever bought my NIO and FSR calls at the very top today.
bubble make my puts go brrrrrrrr

No, but I did buy XPEV :(
[deleted]
sq dip, i wouldve gotten in right now instead of eod yesterday
Looks like $45 just became resistance lmao
 It needs to dip to kill the option holders for today.  MM can't loose too much.
When do you think the NIO downvote party will start?
I sold at 51..  shit I missed the 54
Let us know, edge of my seat
Fuck you citron
Sorry that was just me selling 100 million shares real quick.
Aight NIO knife catchers, get in there!
Hope you're okay bro

Jesus finally another PFE buyer - I lit 500 on fire this week w a PFE call smh
Just goes to show that NIO is being held up by bubble gum and toothpicks.

One person who‚Äôs been holding since $4 sells and that starts causing a lot of panic lmao.
Lucky I jumped in front of the Chinese train with short shares today lol citron made me feel like I am super rightüòÇüòÇ
I sold my NIO puts for 15k gains, they are worth 25k right now.

Gains goblin isn't gonna visit me tonight. LOCK IT IN NERDS.
Lol. O.. right before the dip.
Except these are the rapid antigen tests, their advantage is that they are fast (minutes) at the cost of accuracy. There are also PCR tests which are much more accurate (with practically zero false positive rate and very low false negative rate) but take a couple of hours. No idea why he would do 4 rapid tests instead of a PCR test, I'm sure with his money he can get priority at some lab.
[deleted]
I got in at 21 a month ago, retard. doesn't mean I like to see it drilling
You nailed it
Literally means nothing
I told you all not to buy chinese scam stocks and you didn‚Äôt listen
Citron does this literally every time with every stock that goes big. They wait until its ran for several days, get their shorts/puts in place, and post some FUD trash. After a day or two, the market realizes it was FUD and ignores it.
Accurate
[removed]
Sorry dude.
[deleted]
Holy shit, and I was about to sell my NIO 48 puts I bought two days ago. Too many emotions in this game üò≠.
DKNG not getting me excited and now dipping :/

Sell quickly, theyre smashing earnings
NIO volume is 240m. In this rate it will reach 1B volume EOD.
NIO is a roller coaster today
Losin money man don‚Äôt rub it in
Nio is kill boyz
Great timing on the exit! That 2 min doji 30 after open raised my eyebrows too.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Same
I‚Äôd be homeless and owe a house if bought Nio calls as you suggested.
wow me thinking I had no more chips for this casino.
Nio 53 eod
Wait till nio is down 10% before you buy back in
Yes get on now, next stop 43$
You better have sold
Hell yeah WBA baby
Guh ur speaking the truth
Selling volume on NIO lol
I couldn't buy puts fast enough at 52, way over hyped. Time to come back to reality.
Yes $52 actually
Hop in. Waters warm.

[https://ibb.co/8mP71wt](https://ibb.co/8mP71wt)
Gonna throw you bagholders a bone. Crayons say 45 might be interim support. If it doesn't hold it's beyond ugly EOD.
Already closed out of PTON to reduce losses and DOCU and PINS to lock in gains, I advice everyone to take the same precautions, SPY looks like she about trend down over the next 2 weeks.
3 years ago Citron put a target of $60 on SHOP and said that was generous... current price: $917 what kind of retard listens to them
Try 99%
Citron Pulls Plug On Nio, Says Valuation 'Can Never Be Justified'

Good ole citron..  making $$$$ on nio shorts
This hasn‚Äôt aged well.
NIO really just dropped 20% in an hour ouch
baba calls?
Why did NIO go down?
I don't know, but I'm going to stay. I'm convinced it'll bounce back next week after earnings. Even with the bottom dropping out, I'm still up 10%
Best part
[deleted]
I'm not aging well today either
whats going on with NIO
If you haven‚Äôt sold NIO by now you deserve this carnage greedy bastard
Rolled my nio profits into 80 @tvi calls 3/31/21. Cold War numbers are going to be fucking big. Over 300k viewers at 11am and the best streamers aren‚Äôt even on. Broadband numbers are through the roof in Europe because people are downloading Cold War. MMS own a huge amount of activision and have been keeping the price low for a while now sucking on option premiums but these fucks can‚Äôt hold it back once those numbers get released at the end of the month

All in fist to chest IM READY HOW BOUT YOU?!
Bought the dip

Wtf nio. The oracle was right. She said I'd fall in love with a dead man. I love you.... now, Get up.
Maybe I should have waited like an hour before buying something...
Jeez it just keeps dumping
Citron Pulls Plug On Nio, Says Valuation 'Can Never Be Justified'
Citron just finds overbought runners, takes a short position, tweets, and then exits on the pullback. They‚Äôve tried it with SHOP when it was $200, NVDA when it was $170, PTON when it was $30...the list goes on. They‚Äôre shit. Just scalpers who can move the market because they got it right on Valeant right years ago.
Everything EV related is getting rammed right now
50c 12/18 60c 1/15 üíéüñê
Look at all these retards crying about NIO

That did a casual x15 (1500%) within 6 months, grew more than double within the last month

You retards legitimately fuckin make me lol with your posts

I think we need a new trading competition
Lmao I knew to sell when NIO started dropping after I read that NIO is the most traded option in the market right now
Hope so just bought 270‚Äôs for 12/31

It‚Äôs early still, it‚Äôs just a wee dip for the rich to get richer on by the end of the day.
Hopefully you bought those earlier....

what exactly is in your control? Is what you like or what motivates you under your control? Is your work ethic or your intelligence under your control? Are any decisions we make under our control, after all they're all a function of genetics and upbringing over which, as you noted, no one has any control.
Took my gains. The stock is dropping hard now so it looks like a good choice
Xtra kil now
Wtf SPY

You're up a lot more than that now.

Big ol EV dip
It's not the covid test though, it's a covid test, and the most unreliable one at that.  Idk why he's not getting pcr tests instead, they're far more useful
Stand by my claim:

WSB @ 3:59 ‚Äúwhy TF didn‚Äôt I buy NIO‚Äù

How smooth brain you gotta be to not see the timing of this Citron nonsense.
nio going under 20 where it belongs
Well who couldve seen that one coming
So that NIO dump killed like 80% of this sub based on comments yesterday?
It just went ITM. 0.01 to 1.5 last traded.
Buy high, sell low
I told you NIO puts
FSR holding up well on this dump for now
Cuckening
Citron be tied to that short game
NIO ü§Æ
i bought a few 30p for fun at like .9 to .84 shit is up quite a bit.

of course only a few hundred bucks but gains are gains? heh
Damn everyone getting out of nio
If you are not doubling down on your 11/13NIO calls, you should not be in this sub!
[deleted]
Iffy on FSR... they failed in the past, so whats new?
Last chance to get in NIO before it moons on earnings
to all the bagholders right now, stay warm
How can SPY still hold? Amazing.
1 day rotation back to boomer stocks
Now
I think it's just the market in general going down, rather than EVs specifically
congrats to everyone who just sold nio on that tiny dip hahahahaha
So glad I bought shares and not options. Losing $20 feels like nothing after I lost $600 playing amd earnings. Never again

Haha glad I didn‚Äôt buy NIO calls at open. Sad I didn‚Äôt but NIO calls at open yesterday üò•
I like it, may do similar trade but all a bit further out
Boomer stock in that it‚Äôll actually make you money
But but but...it‚Äôs about connected experiences or something. Isn‚Äôt that worth trillions? Besides, you can‚Äôt connect with people on an iPad.
Definitely doesn‚Äôt look like it had an effect

Yes! If you say it enough times it will be tru!
Yea that is brutal.
Literally every time I reload my account I never have a green day.... What's even the point??
Wow I got so lucky playing nio perfectly today.

alibaba does not move 10% in a single day my friend - it is a boomer stock. i‚Äôll get in when it shows an uptrend
We all hypocritically look the other way in our support of EVs. Lithium has got to come from somewhere.
Hope everyone who downvoted me liked seeing this drop
Selling puts
If you didnt sell Nio yesterday after all ev stocks were up 30% hold this L. No sympathy for you
When you lose it all, just to be patient and gain it back. While some autust buys yolo at low and sell on open spike.
Jesus are you serious

Oh man these SOLO puts are about to print so hard, the Clown Car is running off the road!
Right, we‚Äôve had to wait too long for the Masters. Great tourney so far.

whoever had nio puts is eating lobster tonight
Hey not so bad 20 minutes later
I'm not saying it can't. I'm saying it's (seemingly) unlikely to happen given company performance. There will probably be some sort of correction but any investor should already be prepared regardless of how well one position is doing.
i remember when i copped 100 space puts for cheap asf and hit a 3x on em

Sold NIO at the top, AMA...ü•≥üòé

Sold all my 47p when it 50 cus I thought it‚Äôd bounce all the way back up.. ;(
I have NIO shares, still profitable, should I hold this?
Maybe I'm a girl too?

Nice you‚Äôre probably rolling in tendies right now, was thinking of buying puts. Bought calls instead and paid the price.
Fuck solo
Wrong
Had some work to do, went from plus 3k to minus 500 in that time, NIO givith, and NIO takith away

NIO dip gonna get bought back up for earnings. Ride the earnings wave
Im fairly new to option trading. The higher the premium gets, the more I'm losing. I tried buying more calls but the - keeps getting bigger
 No

Anyone else hopping on lyft? Going long, tendies await.
Hopefully you didn't pull the trigger on this

This aged well
EV pump and dumps lol
It's on occasions like this I wish I was a burger so I could trade options.
Awesome sound.
Prepare to empty your pockets
eh, maybe
Seriously. You know this market is rigged if NIO closes at 39.

Thats the max pain for this week.
HOLY SHIT NIO
They were never gonna b higher. Also these stocks are way overvalued right now.    
Nio is 4tb or 5th most valuable car company In the world lol    
I was looking at nio at 54 and thinking to short it but the IV was crazy. Would have had mad profits if I trusted my gut :-(    
Didn't want to bet against wsb momentum tho
Me. I haven't bought a call in a while, mostly been selling options. This is the one I decide to do. I'm an absolute retard.
Got out of FSR calls with a profit selling lower than when I got in, bought at open and sold just now lmao
Lolol everyone that downvoted my Nio correction comments.
well, gg nio. it was fun while it lasted. it‚Äôll probably be up to 50 again eventually and i only have shares so i‚Äôm good, but rip to everyone with calls
Holy fuck Insane NIO dip. like insane
everyone did say they would take profit when NIO hit 50.
had to mostly teach myself because the information wasn't widely available. anything that was there was pretty basic. so the barrier is that it'd screen out everyone but autodidacts.
Yes, but do wait a few more hours - it'll be overly cheap
Citron price target $25
Dag. Thats a lot of lost money. I really should have sold.
I shouldn‚Äôt have doubled down on NIO, now what I‚Äôm losing serious money here
[deleted]
We made it!
sold nio 47 p at 1.80 

:(
Wow -15% intraday swing on NIO lol
its kinda weird that it took LI's ER to turn sentiment around but who the F knows with these pump/dump shit

or maybe cuz WSB's saturation level of Chinese EV ADRs have hit a peak on the front page
This is why your wife's bf picks up the tab when they go for dinner
u think? i feel like chinese ev gon be comeptitve now that they have so much liquidity and hype
Bought the dip on Li 3 times today. I'm gonna turn off my computer and cry while I hope for the best next week. Best for me to just not look at this shit anymore.
Gonna keep averaging down on $NIO calls. Shit is gonna be $60 next Friday
bye nio, see you at 60 next week
We didn‚Äôt listen......
[deleted]
Wtf is wrong with that stock
SPY is so far away from the fucking VWAP right now WTF
PLTR is boomer stock in disguise. Big fuck you to the guys pumping this lame
Thanks buddy I almost forgot, watch it bump back up to 50 now lol

See you in a year or so
üòÇüòÇüòÇ yea it was either gonna moon or dip hard
TSLA did the same dump on a Friday back in Feb after a massive runup like NIOs. Up 200% on puts bought this morning. Too fucking easy.
just make sure they are long dated and you good. they take turns popping. make sure you take profits when they pop. the ones that are red.. just be patient

Warned everyone of NIO crash right before it crashes: Get downvoted and insulted so I remove my warning.  


Okay have it your way kids.
Drill team keep going I want to see NIO at 40$ in an hour
Hopefully this NIO crash wipes out the simps and only real NIO holders are left standing
The stock seems to behave as 3 rises and 1 dip. I'm unsure if this is the dip since it opened up swinging near 12%. You might want to look into pharmaceuticals since they just announced another Covid spike and there might be an isolation. A few phams are (supposedly/allegedy/exaggerating/idk) in the final stages of a vaccine.
It was written all over the wall so to speak. I rode her up now I‚Äôm ridding her down it‚Äôs been a good week
I think I‚Äôm gonna re enter nio now
I think we all know NIO 55 by EOD when institutionals will kick and start buying..

Right?

Realistically NIO will easily be past 55 before the end of the month. I‚Äôm not surprised it‚Äôs dipping now because it had gone up too quick give it some time and it‚Äôll recover at a more natural pace
It is a clown car but I kinda like it
Sold Nio at 53, not bad ... I‚Äôll take it. This beast will have another big run up to earnings tho

Why not? Because some analyst said to sell?
Anyone has good plays? I sold all my NIO at the top!! Any new companies? Probably for yolo
my puts hope... oh wait, they executed for profit right as I was typing this
Lmao 11/3 45p was a 100 bagger today. If you think you're dumb, remember there was some retard that sold it at 0.01 at open.

haha nio fucking shitcoin
Looks like we are going to close red today.
Make sure you don‚Äôt make the same mistake i did a couple months ago and hold over the weekend with a high iv. Sell those calls and hold the shares id say but who knows im down like 3 grand this week because of stupid moves. So take it with a grain of salt lol

EDIT: I think SPY is on a bumpy road next week therefore I do not believe DOCU time horizon is accurate anymore, While I am still overall long on the company I do urge people to lock in profits when they can and reduce losses when possible.
Imagine all the people living for today
Fuck citron
Am I really? Nio is down 14%
There is no functional difference between a 7 bagger and 10 bagger. Both will make you more money by reinvesting, and potentially get you to the same point, if you don‚Äôt incinerate the bags like a retard.
Imagine buying NIO at 54.20
Ooops
The original investors can pull their money starting on Dec 1 so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm banking on haha with me luck
thank fuck, these NIO fucks were getting annoying spamming every single channel

NIO bears been warning this scenario for the past 2 weeks. So they are right 1/10 as always.
Got out - I had to paper hand. risking way too much. Made a grand off that retarded ass play. Thank you for GL.

Also I still have 4 debit spreads. 2x 3150/3145p and 2x 3100/3095p
Got a couple 43p at the top myself üëç
Star buying NIO dip!!
Why haven't I seen any jokes using NIO and the matrix? Getting sloppy wsb
Lol
This loss porn is going to be the most deserving in a long time
Based of of a less than 3 hour time point analysis, I'd say you are 100% correct.

A dip of less than 5% is really a harbinger of the times.

Nio has NEVER dropped more than 5% and recovered with gains.

Everyone listen to this guy.
Ok you know what nio
Buying the NIO dip bc it's delish
You got lucky
1/21/22
NIO‚Äôs 15% swing üòÆ
so what's the plan?  You still holding?  Any chance it gets to 356 today?
A company that loses its value without its founder is not a company, but a circus.

The CCP can very well crush the ANT IPO.  Minimum they are bringing a lot more regulatory scrutiny towards it, treating it more like a bank than Fintech.  

Ma essentially called out the CCP financial regulators and Vice Premier in a public forum.  

I'm tempted by BABA...but the regulatory overhang risk is really significant.
Picked up FSR March 22.5 calls. I‚Äôm just trying to make an honest dollar.

yikes looool thank god i got out yesterday at the top
Came here to see this.  Buy the dip?
Bought 49p expiring today after I saw it break below my trendline for the second time with a fat red candle. Was watching the charts and everything looking good. Then, a sudden need to shit hits me like a truck. I rush to the bathroom. I'm watching it on my phone but I can't see my TA charts. I see NIO popping back up and I panic. I sell off. After I'm done with my shit, I come back to look at my charts and my heart sinks. I shouldn't have sold. It didn't hit my stop loss. Now I'm sad. My 10% gain could've been a 5 bagger possibly more if this continues. It's way ITM now as I'm typing this
Welp, now I dont feel so retarded panic selling those $49 NIO calls yesterday
Nio says "look out belooowwww"
Which one of you bought calls at open?
What are you smoking? Buy the dip.
NIO was predictable. All FOMO, once the panic set in it all over.

Who knows where this will be in 2 weeks but I feel sorry for the retards who bought the top today. Meme stocks are high reward but very high risk.
This is the way. Open so many positions you aren't sure which way you want the market to move
Ok

[deleted]
yes, leftists hate PLTR. so do libertarians. they'll have the same amount of power under biden, which is to say roughly the same amount of power they have now, which is none.

there's no bear case for PLTR

in addition to the government work they also started doing data shit for fiat chrysler in the last few years, and they've done a good enough job at a company that desperately needs shitloads of data sorted out because they generally don't know what the fuck they're doing internally (FCAU) that they can't afford to ditch PLTR like ever

they're good at what they do
I got downvoted this morning for saying buying NIO at 300% in a month was fucking stupid.
NIO 40p 11/27 and 32.5p 12/11

This will be very profitable but probably never itm.
Shows that rest of the market is strong
I got into the market around April and options was extremely easy, but only in a bull market or extreme bear market. Stocks is easy as fuck and you can actually consistently profit but you need atleast 2k to make anything decent
Let it recover 50 cents and then short/dump $2

Rinse and repeat
Holy fuck they are ded

NIO bags flamin lmao
NIO just started though lol
DOMP EET ‚ö∞Ô∏è
Well, between it and MSFT you'd think so..
25% of my portfolio is in 100 BABA shares @ 274$ and I‚Äôm considering to sell another 25-35% of my portfolio and buy more BABA if it dips even more. The things I‚Äôd sell (in order from what I would sell first to what I would sell last would be NET at 20% profit, oil at 10% profit, AAPL at 3% loss, Green energy at 5% profit. 

Would that be completely retarded?

This would buy me at current prices up to 165 shares and bring my average price to 263.5$
It is overvalued. Nio isn't popular here in China. Have you ever been to China?
More NIO
Paper hands getting out. Big money will use this as a buying opportunity. It‚Äôs going right back up.
After every huge NIO jump there is a solid pullback. Going to get some puts and then switch back to calls next time I see that
ü¶ò ü¶ò ü¶ò
Why couldn‚Äôt they wait till Saturday. They just want to buy on Tuesday before earnings puts Nio at $75
Oh no. NIO is back where it was um, yesterday.
Yes...

Yes. You also have unlimited day trades on the day you go over 3 so might as well go ham
Algos pump and dump.....repeat.  Making their owners rich.

~270,000 volume on NIO calls from 50 to 60 TODAY!! Even if half are close outs - very unlikely - theta gang is about to fucking eat today.

RIP. Not really, tired of hearing about this bullshit boutique company.
BA short squeeze incoming
So it would seem, so it would seem.

whoever bought puts on NIO is gonna be filthy rich
Nah, at 10% sell a CC even further out to mitigate your cost and lock in some gains. That is what I have been doing.
F
AAPL and TSLA been signaling it all day.
Citron Research (short selling firm) released a short report on NIO less than an hour ago. PT at $25. Nio went from +10% to -1% after this.
[deleted]
Right I‚Äôm staying away from it myself, but now is the time to double down on calls if you believed in it yesterday. No conviction here. Lol
Fight back NIO!
You were right!
Byeeee NIO hope you find your dad
Jd dropped from 90 and returned to 90. Im wondering if its not crazy to think baba will return to w90 at least by Friday given how fast jd recovered
No one tell him.
Spy showing a blatant ceiling. starting to smell like bear market
Guess I belong here
17%+ intraday swing for XPEV, 11% for NIO, and 25% for LI

honestly it'll prob continue to rocket cuz of upcoming expectations on NIO's ER cuz thats how this works right?
What strike you thinking? I picked up Jun-21 310s

Just got it at 48 ;)
Buy the Tesla dip
DKNG is basically a seasonal company in an industry that doesn't really belong to a current sector and IPO'ed in COVID year of all years.

DKNG is the last stock that you should try to apply logic to movements following earnings. No one knows how a company like DKNG should be valued or what metrics beyond the $$$ investors should care about.
...no shit, no one expects them to be.
Short jd?
[deleted]
Your bag holding, I‚Äôm bag holding, SPI has done fuck all.
Lmao you clowns spamming NIO last night all got fucked
Umm...nio $35p odte?
They will if their customers all die
And yes,  this is after taking profits.  I had set up and adjusted my stop losses and only a few minutes later the sell-off happened,  so I secured my gains.  

Not many positions now that I cashed out but 3x PLTR 2/19 $16c and FSR 2/19 $15c
NIO you may crash and buy now. Half my call profits in puts now
All the boys who sold NIO and XPEV what are we buying??
Same I rotated my 10 bagger NIO call into puts
[deleted]
Yeah

Sold my 41c at yesterday's peak and bought 49p I'm in the money :)

No good joke
No
[deleted]
Yay NIO I have no position in battery stocks but good thing I really pondered this morning about emerging competitors to take away your market share
holy fuck RIP NIO
Always with the scenarios
I‚Äôm up 30k on NIO. Bought it based on fundamental analysis, dog shitting on the right side of the garden.
Rip
NIOOOOO NOOOO
GMs track record is shotty so I guess you're right NKLA should fit in well. GM doesn't know what they're doing either. The EV Hummer they showed off doesn't run either they said. They won't have a working one in time to fully test it like all the other vehicles. On top of that why didn't they invest in the EV game sooner?
[deleted]
This. Hits so hard.
i‚Äôll buy nio when it hits 41
[deleted]
All those NIO piggies getting spanked lol
Nice, I almost shorted this morning but pussed out
Ummm I used my 3 day trades this week already, can I still sell my NIO options, get flagged as a day trader and get my money out?
LOL at anyone buying the NIO dip
Nice. I‚Äôm only in AMD. Taking a small hit today.
Opened at almost 39 pumped to almost 41 and then poof
Dude move on
NIO FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!
This price action very sus
I‚Äôm gay
Lol, today is gonna be a bad day....

Most of these posts make me happy to work at a job where I‚Äôm barred from making direct stock purchases, but this is one of those times that makes me wanna quit, take a job at Denny‚Äôs, and yolo my paychecks

BABA has to go up eventually right? 

Jack isnt just sitting in his house thinking " oh well I cant IPO and the government hates me now, I think Ill just play with myself until I die and fuck this company"

Any thoughts?

Bring out your deadüîîüîî
Bought the dip on wday. Consolidating right at its 50 day sma with earnings next week. Could get a good gamma pop
Wait what
That's cool. I bought both my homes outright and am 42. Never have these feelings you obviously struggle with. You still can change.
been playing with mine for a week now, fuck that i aint no simp. Sold at 3% gain :(

I felt retarded for selling my NIO calls at open but I no longer feel that way now lmao
Is it right time to get NIO calls
Gay bears go to hell!!
EV aint going anywhere just sit tight i know red is scary but use your brains
Whaddya mean, that's what caused this.
Y'all dumb as hell if you think NIO is "done" lmfao
remember when SLV gang said it will be $50 by eoy? LOOOL
Wait so FSR reports earnings on 11/25 üòÇ
Im looking at SE. it‚Äôs Singapore but still. Same people lol.
Hey i‚Äôm still new to the stock market but i love the memes here. Can someone explain in the most brutally honest way as possible if NIO is worth holding on to?
what about LI Auto? I got a contract with them as well. If Nio goes up then LI Auto goes up correct?
if ur looking for a good place to stash ur NIO tendies, buy DIS
BUY THE EV DIP
I mean, if I were that age, I'd want to be pulling in like 4% with little to no risk, tbh. Losing your ass at 67 is no joke. Gotta pay the electric blankie bill.
One of the MMs might have seen this post.
Lol NIO dropping so fast Yahoo dropped resistance down to 0
Which chart do you use? 5min?
I sure hope none of you NIO holders are being pussies and getting scared by this little pullback. It will be 100 within a month or two
what the FUCK is spy DOING
Thanks! I must have missed this. Appreciate it
[deleted]
NIO volume is already double the average. Still 5 more hours to go.
Your train is derailing
Who bought nio calls at the top?
#You guys gambling with CCP stocks are Day Traitors.
LI went red after being up 27% this morning, wowza
My biggest investments are: BRK, SPG, PCG, GME; all of which I got from here. I'm not going into fucking NIO
Can't believe my NIO $44p might make some money, shit looked dead in the water last night. Wish I held my $43c til open instead of selling yesterday afternoon, though
Loaded up on NIO/FSR puts
Wow if you bought nio puts at the top today, you are raking it in
Just what I was hoping for. Still not going to buy in until Monday though.
How do you sit there and see all these memes on WSB about NIO and *not* sell calls or buy puts?
There will be BLOOD on Friday the 13th!! I've warned you last night!!! üíî
Rotation out of communism
just a few stocks if I notice a pattern, do you have any consistent ones?
BUY AES BUY AES BUY AES 

THIS IS MY ONE AND ONLY WARNING. 

I CALLED FISV, I CALLED CVS, I GOT IN BABA LAST TIME IT WAS $262. I GOT IN PYPL DURING THE SEPTEMBER DIP.

AES IS GOING TO THE MOON. LOOK AT THE OPTIONS ACTIVITY. THIS STOCK HOLDS $20 STORNG.

Lol Citron with the hit Job on Nio
sq making upside down batman
Are we buying this dip damn fuck shit
Fuck man
Alright, maybe no V shaped recovery today LOL.

Panic sell so I can sell some juicy puts
you fucking retards relax
alright guys who bvought the nio top let's hear it
If the prophecy is right, NIO‚Äôs still closing +8% this PM after the usual morning dump. 

But hey, wouldn‚Äôt put a DIME on it, you just can‚Äôt do with logic with these guys.
nah better to miss opportunity than lose money trying to average down
Quit the panic selling ffs!
When do you think you well sell your puts? I was thinking of selling on Monday
guess the prophecy is coming true finally.
Apparently all it takes is for one guy to say the stock is valued at a certain price and everyone decides that it‚Äôs fact
Holy fuck its 2025 already
22
I bought nio calls at +10%
Printing brother
Duck played too much nio and lost bigly after being up bigly
Li with a casual 25% drop
Sold my NIO puts for 300%. A quick 15k üòãüòã gl everyone.
Citron is retarded but Hindenburg isn‚Äôt. They exposed the gravity powered NKLA lol. They then applied that same technology to the NKLA stock price.
Elon's goal for Tesla, which he is explicit about, is to start the EV revolution. He frequently says he wants competition as that will signal it's working.

EV revolution: starts

Competition: exists (maybe)

WSB: trollol Elon getting owned

Also who cares I'm long TSLA, NIO, XPEV, TAN, CRBN, PBW. I will be surprised if all these Chinese EV meme stocks are still relevant in 6 months, but that's the game and why I'm not yolo into any
oof that nio crash is tough...luckily solo is still holding strong ‚úäüèΩ
Those $40p 3/21s I bought yesterday for NIO looking smarter by the minute
Nah. Not feeling cool. SPY looks suspect. 
Rolled my MRNA otm calls to next week they‚Äôre not announcing today. Closed a couple positions. Jacked up on SOLO monthly puts, and added some SPY ITM puts 0DTe, draft kings 0dte puts. Not feeling the vibe, bulls and consumer confidence lacking.
lol what was LI's open again? jesus christ that premarket got a lot of ppl probably.
>Chinese e-commerce droppin?  

Been dropping ever since CCP came out with draft rule targeting monopolistic practices by BABA, JD, etc.  

Also came out with another draft rule today targeting livestream advertising, which apparently plays a big role in retail purchases there.
Thinking QQQ 300c for 11/20 at EOD
Apple is literally going back to ATH and people want to talk about puts? Hope your future children like food lines.
My bad I bought NIO, I‚Äôll sell now so it goes back up.
Sure they can. But when a company issues new stock, it's usually for a reason that will increase the value of a company, which will offset the dilution. Many CEOs and other upper management won't purposefully decrease the share price for no reason because they're compensated via stock options. It's in their best interest to increase shareholder equity...
Got out near 50 never looking back

Loading up on UVXY calls only way I can maybe profit off this mess

 **10 minutes in and going strong** 

Me too.....no wait.
Saw NIO was down had to cum here real quick
They aren‚Äôt called NIO ‚ÄúBLOOD RED FRIDAYS‚Äù for nothing
No one ever made real money in the market by having weak hands. Just think back to how many times you sold too early only to leave big gains on the table....then fomo'd back in at a higher price.
Lol analysis.

Did you buy it on a whim? Or did you research it and thought it was a solid Chinese company?

damn I almost bought NIO today when it was vertical. I am glad I'm retarded and bought PSTH stocks and SQ calls instead

Rug pull on the EV big three. Bye bye
ya'll were soo busy celebrating NIO you forgot to check the 

"is literally everybody on WSB buying this?" indicator
Sorry I‚Äôm retarded and forgot to include positions, I bought NIO calls like everyone else yesterday

2 contracts $50c .98 sold for $2.80 

9 contracts $52c $.50 a contract sold for $1.80

1 $55c for $.13 sold for $.90
NIO wiping out half this sub üòÇüòÇ
sorry guys i bought NIO Calls.
Lol wtf is that xD
aaaaand now!
I'm not fucking selling. Citron can suck my sour dick.
TL;DR?
I‚Äôm not gonna buy NIO puts
What will NIO reach next week? Surely it‚Äôll go up pre earnings
I just typed "msft cock" into google instead of msft stock. Could this be a sign? ü§î
As a Reminder. i been telling you guys for a while.

The max pain for today on NIO is 39.

Shit got old quick
Well, theres your dip for everyone that wants to play NIO earnings next week
[deleted]
Wait, we're back to trading off fundamentals?
I guess no DKNG bulls left on this sub - not a peep on a day that it moons on earnings!
anyone else getting in on Moderna... im considering
RIP to anyone who held NIO. Sold my calls and shares after it broke through VWAP.
Are you holding tqqq shares?!
[deleted]
[removed]
RUH ROH
Same, sold at the tippy top
Stop playing RKT bro, it‚Äôs a piece of shit stock. Good company but a apiece of shit stock. Get in PLTR
Is it worth trying to scalp without day trades by locking in the trade with a spread?
Citron is a murderer.
annnnnnd look at that, all you speculating clowns are going to get slaughtered on Nio.  Chinese EVs are one of the worst mini bubbles I've seen in a loooooong time.  This is like watching fools getting slaughtered on dogshit like Pets.com, eToys, and WorldCom back in the day.
if you don't know that SLV is dropping to 12 eom, you should get yourself checked for retardation
Gonna re enter nio at $45
What‚Äôs going to help AAPL break the $125 price?
Because I bought calls
this is wack AF, but i have faith NIO will bounce back before 11/20
Right?! I timed that top perfectly
Citron just gave NIO a 25 dollar price target and said that the current price cant be justified
Didn't' say I was. Just think that we should keep things they say accountable/grain of salt.
Fuck
sold my calls for 300%
CITRON research gave them a price target of $25. Toilet paper hands are collapsing
[deleted]
I'm a wise man now with less hair
Bye NIO
You are correct. This is what is happening now. I will in the future only post fairy tales.
NIO 300% my worthless account on Monday. Now -95%. Oh man
Who pissed off the Nio MM‚Äôs?
dont forget to laugh.
3080
Places for possible NIO bounce is at $45.80 and $40.40. After that, might see $20.

Source: I'm guessing.

Wtf is happening to NIO, I thought it only goes up
I‚Äôm only saying this cause I bought at $53. Fuck off
Imagine not selling your expiring NIO calls at open when it was up 10 percent
One word...DUH!

Their sales are dwarfed by Tesla. That‚Äôs expected.
Good night sweet NIO :(
NIO took elevator up, free fall down.
SPCE is the future. Long term on that bitch
LMAO
Taking a fat dick up the ass with NIO. Gotta love it
Don‚Äôt take any investing advice from this sub

This is the fuckin way bruh inverse these guys
How much will nio drop though that shits a meme

Seems like a really unstable stock in general, I could see it going up long term but predicting short term seems like a gamble
A profit is a profit man, not many get gains like that, and you should be happy, that was a great play.
No never again
Oof, NIO dropping like a sack of Chinese nuts
NIO is kil
So glad I got out of my NIO calls an hour or so ago.

You guys hear the news about nio yet? Doesn‚Äôt look like it
Fuck you
Yea Jack Ma went and ruined a lot of portfolios.
I‚Äôm with ya. I‚Äôm in fsr and PLTR instead
Wow, I so vindicated with these NIO puts.
Lmaoo what you tryna to do? Spread some panic or what hha
SHIT
XPEV wtf. shoulda sold at 50
Yeah LTM sales multiple is 48x. But LTM does not matter for growth - I'd say its prob 20x next twelve month sales.
That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre here
Yes, but you need a decent amount of capital to make it worthwhile.  That‚Äôs why most of these guys are doing options
Positions? I‚Äôm likely holding HD but can‚Äôt average down any more today.
3x AMZN 3100p 0DTE. stress to the max

NIO puts printing
im just gonna catch the knife on NIO to make up for the fomo
Yeah Jack Ma definitely came up as a much bigger idiot in that ‚Äúdebate‚Äù.
He's right. If you check the financials on this company you will see they are not even profitable yet.
I also question this... not saying that you are wrong... just that assuming that the test will have the outcome of having enough people self isolate is a huge stretch. As I was mentioning in the previous comment, a false negative test might encourage enough super spreaders to go around spreading it with the claim that they tested negative. When otherwise, not having the test might make them self isolate if they were diagnosed with only their symptoms.
That shit is gonna print money when the bubble pops
NIO puts
Thanks nio?? Control your greed lmaooo
Corona lockdowns are here for at least another six months, how long until tech bounces back?

This exactly is what blew up almost all my profits for the year, went from up 140% to only up 20% as of today, but I'm buying the baba dip with 3 month out contracts, we will see what happens

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.

Damn OP. I can't read and yeah that was dickish.  Looks like my early morning ass needs coffee before speaking.  Sorry to be an asshole.

So a chinese gov backed company can rise 1000% but cannot drop 50% right? We should all buy every single chinese state backed company, including the coal company that just defaulted its loans today.

Something announced with NKLA? Was down this morning, now there's a big jump
I bought SPY poots. Fuck. Your. Sofa.

I bought like 5k worth of calls two days ago expecting to get rich, made a post bragging about it on WSB yesterday, everyone called me retarded so I  dumped my calls this morning at what just happened to be the top lmfaoooooo

I love this subreddit
Inverse all you bears. 11/20 SPY 360s let‚Äôs go üöÄüöÄüöÄ
WHAT
Citron research was a big NIO promoter earlier, learned their lesson from TESLA and admitted to it publically. I give them credit for that and their recent 25$ target
So when my NIO puts ive been spamming to buy make me king of the world do I become king of WSB? Check the post history.
Come on TSLA do the thing. *pokes*
calls for days, got it. bullish af
They literally control the price
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôd rather the volatility even if I lose money than this flats shit
Am I the only one who isn‚Äôt trading NIO? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm reading about today.
i heard that last week
May2021 60c
250 end of 2021
Do people seriously just listen to CNBC then trade? As soon as Cramer talked about Baba, it dumped.   so ghey
Don't hate the playa

Lol yeah it‚Äôs retarded but wait for when it would go down and your puts would lose value cause the iv went down üòÇ
Finally
buy the dip with PTON?
I'm not an expert in this shit. But GM is. I'm just betting that GM knows what they're doing, and NKLA stock will be the beneficiary of it.
Damn, NIO 1mo chart looks like it's doing the classic "flatline with build up speed to launch off ramp at full throttle while drinking soda, hiccupping slightly, taking a moment to cry and reverse anal bleeding" pattern...sigh I hate when stonks do that...
Is LI going to be in the red by the end of the day?
10% dip in 30 minutes should be all the warning necessary that you're playing with fire. But whatever.

"buy the dip"
In case you‚Äôre wondering how it went it went fucking terribly
Picked up Jan calls slightly otm, if they go well will expand the position

Well done!
Nope the time to sell was 30 minutes ago. Ride this out if you‚Äôre still holding.
Yeah, I'm quite confident it will get back to at least 290 but by when, I don't know. Market better not suddenly crash next week.
BABA show me some love.
Probably right
it wont move and its so frustrating. like i have 185c but id rather it tank or moon than stay flat
so puts on ev?
I might recover if it climbs back to 52
baba, what the fuck?
Is anybody actually planning on holding NIO long term? Think about where it will be by this time next year
Sure buddy. Keep telling yourself that

is spy going to move at all today or are we going to trade within a small .2% window again during intraday?
Yea you get premium and it disappears every day from your bank account. Sometimes they might double dip and take extra money too for being a bitch and not buying straight calls

Dude just go. Youre making your wifes bf cry ffs.

If you touch radioactive waste like Nio, at least fucking set trailing stop losses for heaven's sake so you don't get slaughtered. All of the idiots chasing after chinese EVs are going to lose their shirts by 2021 if they keep holding.
In at 3.8 and still holding strong!

Thanks for confirming my bias
Buy longer dated calls or learn to take profits on your FDs idiots, if you can't do either, then just light your money on fire.
I think nio is priced in for earnings.
IV is insane on nio puts. I bought yesterday at a LOWER price than NIO is right now and even despite theta, I am almost breaking even.
Fuck I miss that meme
just sold all baba and yolo'd nio 11/20 calls fuggit
Yea I fell for a similar trap the other day. Going to do the same
Twice.

I feel vindicated.
Lol yup. It‚Äôs slowly climbing back up like usual, we‚Äôll see. Fucking insane really
I have a feeling Morgan Stanley, Sequoia and team will Risk Manage their way out of NIO this PM. i.e. Sell to a reasonable level 40 EOD
And dentist?
Not poor. I enjoy making a grand in a day.
Nice dead cat bounce nio
CCP is going to crush ANT.  

Ma bragging about how ANT's business model involves getting China's state banks to baghold personal loans essentially brought a shit ton of scrutiny to their business model.
always amazes me how a short/research company that has gotten so many things wrong can still have so much impact.
You fucking ding dongs, I called it,
Either way I lost money.
You can have one green candle NIO, as a treat.
They know a lemon when they see one.
Before others say r/antstreetbets I wanna say, try your best to not daytrade 5 times in a day and get banned from daytrading. Been 10x more stressful when I have to wait a whole day to secure gains or jump ship

Looks like it's time to baghold some BABA
Don‚Äôt worry NIO will end at 55$ EOD
BABA will com back..... but maybe not soon enough to save our calls.
Those are gonna be strong long-term holds the way I see it

NIO DIAMOND HANDS BABY
60
What is FVAC looking to acquire?
Thanks, I'm aware of that thread. The idea of leveraging cheaply via short SPX boxes is fine, the portfolio he chose however was not. Leveraged ETFs, further leveraged via margin is so far past the optimal leverage level that a blow-up was a matter of time. I've been doing the above for 2 years now, March was OK, no blow-ups.
What you think about cbat? Havent made any dd just saw it here something batteries with eV and its up 66%
Ahh, fair enough
buy nio calls rn????
Back to the fucking moon
What was the play?
Same question.
You can't on Robinhood you can on Webull or the big boy programs

Oh yea it‚Äôs definitely 350 easy but if you are playing weeklies expecting to make money, you‚Äôll get burned unless you time it right
I still have time man, Dec 11th...just have to digest this one..hoping this momentum doesn't extend..

I made a lot of money back that I had lost the last week + this week. I made all of it back and more and most of it was off NIO yesterday and today. Until 10am lol. Hopefully it recovers, they expire today lmao.

Best part about WMT is you have a great chance of being flat or green on red/dump days. Plus it has so much going on for them and earnings next week that its going to pop after hearing Walmart+ numbers and beating on revenue.
My God the sentiment in this sub changes every 5 seconds. ‚ÄúBuy the NIO dip‚Äù ‚Äî 5 minutes later ‚Äî ‚ÄúFuck you NIO‚Äù. Can y‚Äôall learn how to trade instead of buying the top of every meme stock

This is the equivalent to when yesterday all these chicken little paper hands types thought it was ‚Äúover‚Äù because mango wanted to ban Chinese stocks and securities
LoL retards really think MM gonna make their 0dte EV calls print. This is just reaping profits from gamblers, if you hold leaps or shares you fine
This is the dip to buy.  Theres nothing till tuesday earnings....it will go up

Yes, I would normally wheel AMZN or TSLA; but now full blown NIO.

Your company has no revenue. And it‚Äôs business model is a fraud

Other brokerages you can
market overview chart looks so bearish but spy is up 2 dollars. Nasdaq has scary movement
Honestly just imagine being retarded enough to not buy the NIO dip. It's like the train you missed miraculously turning around for you and you still don't hop on.

I'm doing a little theta-ganging until Sleepy's inauguration, just to keep things interesting.
That was your last chance to get in on NIO
People trying to learn? I‚Äôm asking to learn. Haven‚Äôt done anything.
No, get AYRO
I still have time man, Dec 11th...just have to digest this one..and pray the momentum doesn't continue
Nid like $50 to buy a call, i have $2
Generally I‚Äôd agree that the top is in for NIO, but surely y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt forget about Tesla? Shorts were annihilated.
How high did it get to? I saw everyone posting premarket so I checked it out and that‚Äôs where it was at when I looked lol

this is the bottom
Tbh, all you yolo 11/13 call holders on China evs are the reason mms are dropping it, a record number of call options were placed on nio for 11/13, I expected this. They will take ur premiums before it moves again next week, don‚Äôt fuck with the big guys. 

Nio 5/21 and 1/23 30$c
Yea it‚Äôs the IV, when NIO is at ATH people are anticipating that it will drop which is more likely than it continue to go up so put premium increases as people buy

I‚Äôm not sure, trying to time this is dangerous. They are overbought for sure and I think will return to 6 month average after this craze like we saw in Tesla. But again, could run up to and past earnings

If ur comparing NIO to NKLA I've got to say how do you even see them as comparable? One actually has running vehicles with real people and isn't a fairytale rip off of exactly Tesla's brand.
Imagine being up 12% on the day and saying that the bubble is popping
Blood Red on Friday the 13th!!! üòà
How many of you idiots waited to buy nio until yesterday before close
LOL love this comment
Are you one of those people that‚Äôs always wrong? If so please do short PFE. If not, yes it‚Äôs bad.
NIO‚Äôs premiums are much higher than TSLA‚Äôs now. It‚Äôs better to play wheel strategy on NIO
I eat lots of soy and have an electric car. Honestly this checks out
Did you guys actually think nio was dead? Jesus Christ the overreactions
I mean you probably missed out alteady
Citron short
thinking chinese EVs still go on another faceripper today soon lol
No way that gyna car companies not a fucking hustle at this stage.

I respect the players playing it but if you get burned stfu it was pure casino

Literally did the same today. Been holding Jan 20c got rid of it. Wanted to sell last week but was like fuck going to hold till 50. Behold it happened today. Still got some equity will ride that one for a bit.
I mean, the stock is volatile and it's a friday. I highly doubt that a government backed company is going to lose half of its value just because Tesla decided to make one model of their product cheaper than expected. That being said, still should be hedging against any possible corrections so make sure yolo on nio puts
Can we have "Meme stock" flair discussion board please?
Wait, you're telling me a stock that more than tripled in value in 3 months is seeing some profit-taking?!?!

But how the fuck did i make money on my puts when NIO was up 10% .

Im seriously at a loss for an explanation on how my put premiums went up? its gotta be Vega and IV right?
Guess who bought NIO calls at 930am today

You're welcome, bears
Buying power needs to be 0, make it happen or ban for being a pussy
It‚Äôll get there for sure I‚Äôm just gonna hold

DAMN it feels good to be a gangster. 

Real gangsters retire on NIO puts.

I fucking knew it. My timing was off since I sold at 47 but I knew that shit would pump and dump before earnings. Imma buy that sweet dip on Wednesday. NIO ALL DAYYY
What you are doing is called fomo.  You are afraid of missing out and want to ride the coat tails of people posting excitedly about their retarded gains.  The only thing worse than making retarded plays is blindly copying other peoples retarded plays after they are in the green enough to make excited posts about how much money they are making.

Please tell me you bought puts at the top. Those things are printing right now.

Gentlemen it has been a privilege playing with you today.
"but it keeps dipping"

What?
Bulls in fuckin shambles this week.  Every day it's the same shit,  green open then watch your gains go bye bye.
"I used to browse the sub for some quality DD" Surely you must mean Debt and Disappointment.
Same! I always buy at the peak! But the other day I bought before it dipped to 39 and I‚Äôm still kicking myself in the ass for paper hands and selling instead of holding. Was at 50 the next day. I‚Äôm holding!

What‚Äôs the cause of the dip?
I‚Äôm short NIO and soybeans. Because there‚Äôs nothing more soy than a Chinese electric car.

Cashed out NIO

Well said....
NIO dropped like 5$ now but its still above previous close and its a 40$ stock.
No matter how bad your trading day is going...you could've been the guy who finally decided to go all in on NIO today üòÇ
Imagine not buying baba right now

Whou bought nio at top?
I think I bought the top of nio.
congrats
Scaled in with shares as an investment after earnings. Should‚Äôve bought more. Didn‚Äôt expect it to move this fast.
oh boy...NIO about to go red haha
Autists angry because they bought EV stocks at the top after it skyrocketed.
Just like that huh...
drill nio drill!
#WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO OUR BOY?
Took my profits on NIO and got out, fuck those dumb ass lemon fuckers ruining the fun
Why not AYRO?
Van a flows gonna keep it pinned all week without macro news
Lol just wait till Ford and Toyota dominates the industry once again. Ford just revealed it‚Äôs electric van today.
NIO 44 by eod
Glad I cashed out when I did. Def reloading at eod
Nio just needed to fill the gap
Baba calls are still the most expensive thing
RIP SOLO 10c...
yes everyone sell so the price lowers please
this is what theta gang never admit, getting blown out in a single play
We are currently testing Wednesday's \~257 low... I am hoping this is the bottom because my position has taken a beating the past few days.
Congrats, yes you're young. Keep being smart. If you're going to day trade then only use a small amount that you can afford to lose if it goes wrong.

But keep your major investments in safe long term stocks.

Just hold and be patient. The markets move up generally (unless it's a company like Hertz going through bankruptcy and problems). 

NIO seems like a good stock but its volatile af. PLTR is too cheap not to jump on it. TSLA may be a bit overbought idk I don't trust it enough to invest much in it right now, but they're a good solid stock to hold according to some analysts. 

Consider getting in on some solar energy stocks too. Solar is going up a lot. 

icln, csiq are two good solar stocks imo 

Atvi, crsr, are also two other stocks I love but they're in tech and gaming 

If you keep investing you'll be golden. Save money on housing and vehicles and invest it instead. Don't go crazy and live lavish even if you can, make that money grow first.
NIO 5-day vwap under 45... right?
lol right, does he always act like she's his mommy ?
lol 51-> 54 -> 49  

wth is NIO
Look at save lolll
Almost at it's low RSI rn
i am holding my 11/20 calls
Im down to 7k, fuck
How much for just 10ft.?
Hope all you idiots are enjoying getting fucked by NIO. Who am I kidding you‚Äôre all gay so you probably are
haha fucking NIO! My 0 DTE 49 puts arent dead
Did NIO pre-earnings selloff start already? üòÆ
Which will happen first?

NIO > $30

TSLA > $500
Where is this NIO selloff coming from
Damn LI just got massacred, XPEV going red
seriously it's too much.
Tech so ghey
I enjoy how much you sound like an autist

NIO hit my stop loss at 51, bought a few back at 50.68 sold a 55c for 4.00
Lol
its dipping hard rn
Sold 65/60 call credit spreads lol
[removed]
I lost $5k on puts last week, switched to calls, lost $3500 this week. It's literally the most WSB thing I've ever done.
Is there a reason you think that or just speculating?
We should‚Äôve  both waiting an hour. Just our luck :(
Damn they're gonna take NIO red? This is crazy

PLTR bout to double top... poots on SOLO.... life is good today
Me too bro I went in at 40... it peaked and I was going to cash out to stop my losses and blinked... held my breath and now here we are. Positions are all about to get closed by my traders üòÇ can‚Äôt wait to watch it bounce and I‚Äôm in debt lol
Portfolio is a dump rn
Buy the dip
Bought $140 DIS calls in may for 2022. Been looking real nice. Thinking about being greedy and cashing out now. Or...should I let'er ride?
Why looking at past and think what you could have retired. Go look for more of these deals.
Then buy puts that will be ITM... IV doesn‚Äôt matter if exercise value is $1,000 a contract.

I bought early. On the rise. Low IV. Got tons of $45 puts. It‚Äôll go to 35. IV doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôll be $8 per share ($2 purchase price break even) on many many contracts. Fuck IV.

**but, it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs going down. Puts are sky rocketing. Needed to listen all week when I was spamming :)**
Man theres gotta be Chinese bots in here or something.
Piss off.  This is not your dumping ground for business related news stories.
i think the odds are priced in
It doesn‚Äôt matter if NIO is insolvent and a fraud. Biden getting elected is bullish af for them and they‚Äôll continue to run to 100b+ valuation. Guaranteed.
I bought in at $53 so now you can buy the big dip I created. You're welcome fucker
Nio bout to rally
üò≠üòÇ
He needs to be assassinated.
PLTR to 20 by Monday
you know sold 2 days ago as even then it was too much. Lets pick something else from the ARKK list.

My problem with puts for next week is the IV crush
Citron advised everyone to buy NIO at $7 and now they are uncomfortable at $50 ü§°. Which means they told everyone to buy and then when price went above $25, they shorted heavily. But the stupid investors kept buying it and now they are in margin call.

Don't do it bruh, think of all the money you won't get to lose in the future if you off yourself
Cause you‚Äôre a retard
Thanks for the DD. Investing right now!

i hope nio dies today so yall can get off china's nuts.

Probably a bad fill. LULU's bid/ask spread is pretty wide in general. Also hi, hope you've are doing well.
f
I‚Äôve probably lost more on fees this week...
Watching nio call holders get shook in realtime is fun. Well it would be more fun if I wasn't one of them, but still fun.
Citron released an article saying it‚Äôs overvalued
NIO to $20
sq has gotten nice price upgrades but hasnt moved. idk what else it needs smh
Should have gotten more WMT dip
Lmao. Gonna be a lot of downvote soldiers today
you fool, NIO doesnt need gas, thats literally the point of the company

Ouch.... totally burned on NIO. oooooo
NIO and LI are about to turn into the red wedding here
Here for the nio tears, thx citron
wow i actually played PLTR earnings intelligently, sold half my 1/15 16c yesterday for a 33% gain, held on to my 5/21 calls and bought a 11/20 15p for insurance. overall i'm up on the sumbitch
 Wanna buy the dip but IV way too high, selling puts on the other hand...
This is my fault guys. I bought at 52. Every stock I buy goes down.
holy shit bud.  how have you not been assigned?
Zoom just dumped hard
Lmao, my puts are starting to print as we speak.

Feel free to cross post it if you want.
PFE finally coming alive today? need to salvage these 11/20 calls
I hope so and everyone gets their tendies. It would also be insane to ignore the tendency for WSB to bag hold after a pump n dump. Just watch out and set those trailing stop losses.
Any ev puts.  Although 20 minutes would have been good.  Get in now

does nio go up to atleast 52 again?
[removed]
its too inconsistent and unproven for me. it boomed once last night. at least with NIO, its pretty linear. i would personally swing trade on NIO

with NIO if shit hits the fan you wont get a big loss, if u do u can hold out and recover it back. but i can see SOLO dropping $2-3 in a day and maybe not recovering
Same...
You‚Äôll be down today but you‚Äôll be up all next week.

I DUMPED MY NIO POSITION AT THE ABSOLUTE PEAK AND NIO HAS FALLEN 5% IN THE LAST 25 MINUTES!
If you think nio is worth more than Ford right now then sell it if you think people will come to their senses (as they always do and panic sell, look at Tesla for example) then hold it. I know I‚Äôm holding mine :)
I went all in on SOLO and NIO, probably gonna hold through earnings on NIO and hope for a xpev like run after
https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseEV/ they seem retarded af
Maybe don‚Äôt buy at the top retard
Buy the nio dip you stupid sons of bitches
Pltr 0dte if it crosses 16 could actually work, but be careful
I'm pretty sure it's false negative in his case, and he should know that 4 is a pretty small sample size to determine whether it's problematic or not.

2 weeks ago I got tested because our contact tracing app told me I have been in contact more than 15 minutes with someone infected. I got tested but the nurse told us that the policy was to still self quarantine for 14 days, whatever was the result. We were both negative and still went through with it as it just doesn't make sense to risk it. In our case though Canada does it way better and we can be supported financially through it (we didn't need to go through theses programs though as I work from home and my GF's business is closed). 

The tests are essential to determine the propagation and increase/decrease the amount of measure to contains it. Its false negative rate doesn't matter much I think.
Guys someone help me someone help me please

I'm 19 and turned 3k into 11k earlier this year. 

Convinced myself I can stretch my car budget from $12k to $20k, so I bought the car I've been lusting for the past couple years. 

My all time gains currently sits at like $500 ._.
I can't even buy this fucking nio dip my calls I sold at +9% are worth 5% more at +4%, apparently.
pro tip

wait for this guy to panic sell for a loss and then buy back in right as he does it so you can scalp a quick 20-30% gain
oh shit, cool. I been looking into overnight trading. im intrigued

My gains did great 1000$+ in Nio gains congrats to all
Amazing how we get to see the 1day chart of the almighty NIO 2020 bubble pop. In 20yrs when NIO is back at $4 people will wonder what happened in 2020
imagine not selling your nio this morning at 54

Don‚Äôt buy this dip.. not this time
If we are going by confirmed cases divided by confirmed covid deaths that is inaccurate. Going by anything else is speculation. The flu would actually be a way bigger deal if 200 million people a year in the USA got it, as some estimates have said that many have gotten covid. Either way covid is likely to be in the top 3 causes of death in the USA this year

Doesn‚Äôt help much if the doctor tells you the results of your test, instead of a clear yes/no answer. Specially when the scientific community does not know as much about the virus as other illnesses, not blaming them here, it‚Äôs a new virus and is a hard one. But when average people ask their doctor, will I have long term symptoms? Will a vaccine be ready? Can I get re-infected? And the answer is ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù and also ‚Äúthis test shows you might (not) be positive‚Äù. You really think people are gonna rely on their doctors opinion?

the NIO haters are just trolls. even if theres a red day or two, it will bounce back higher. its always done this. no stock is green every day.

those same people will say "fuuuckkkk... i shouldve bought it at 50"
You want to buy NIO on the dip? This IS the dip.
Chart of the most of EV stocks look very similar today, level 2 data shows similar order blocks of 100, 200, 300 shares.

Seems like these are mostly algo trading
TBH i'm not even mad I bought NIO at the top today. I got a December call instead of a weekly and I'll let it ride even if NIO goes red today. Earnings run up monday, tuesday rally from earnings beat and the rest of Nov to go to 80+. Take profits, buy back in at the bottom and let it ride.

NKLA showing Chinese companies how to do fraud right. American-style
LOL...looks like big dump on NIO
I don't think anything can be done by Ma.

First of all he isn't in control of BABA anymore. Secondly even if he comes out and apologizes etc etc that won't do anything for investor sentiment.

The Chinese officials probably wouldn't acknowledge it anyway and we are still going to be stuck waiting for everyone to forget about it and bank on people realising it actually doesn't affect BABA at all.

Unfortunately it could be until January until next BABA earnings that actually comes to fruition.
That will honestly print. Congrats on the future gains
was selling at 1.95 for 11/20c.   now it is $1 lower.  Stand by.  20% guaranteed return felt good for a week while I gamble on other options.

just keep grinding it out boys don't steal from your future by making rash decisions.
Good morning! Enjoy! Be sure to go spend a little bit on yourself every once in a while. This is the weekend :)
I bought NIO at 52 but it‚Äôs ok cause we‚Äôre headed to 60 boys, just refueling for the launch
No. NIO will cut down to XPEV‚Äôs market cap bc they‚Äôre so similar. Which is half NIO‚Äôs current share prices. Good luck.

I‚Äôve been saying this all week check my history. No one listens.
I like you style. Home run or bust.

LADS. Lads. NIO is getting a battery swap, just chill, we got this

I am in and this is true.

Are people buying SOLO just because it is a EV?   
Or are people expecting 3 wheeled vehicles to be the future?
Yep this is why I am not going to get back in until after earnings, because earnings seems to fuck everything up every time
Y‚Äôall really saw NIO have an insane rally and aren‚Äôt taking profits? Peak WSB
I figured it would be more of a buy and hold, they aren't going to be selling cars until 2022-2023, but still have had quite a run since ipo a couple weeks ago. They're contracted with a german manufacturer to make the ocean and it seems pretty legit. will supposedly be affordable too, like a $380 / month lease

This is the right place for the clueless. Make yourself comfortable.
Dunks or sacais?
Let me send my cashapp
Just needs his morning coffee.
It looks like batmobile for poor ppl!
If you're so confident skip a step and buy puts
Smart man. I got greedy and now hate myself lol
guys nio just mooned 30% its just consolidating and going to hold 50 for a week then moon next week again ^__^
It's not even about wealth. I like Bezos.

It's more that there's nothing scarier than a neckbeard drunk on power.
Hope you did it. Huge winner!
You aren‚Äôt in the right place to be posting gains of 500 dollars. That amount of money nobody here gives a fuck about because that‚Äôs a bi-weekly paycheck for a lot of folks. Go to babystreetbets, they might actually care
Mix in your family‚Äôs tears to turn it into a mortar-like substance.
YESSSSS
Gutted not having access to options rn
Don‚Äôt sleep on Lordstown Motors and their EV truck.

They‚Äôre targeting fleet sales, not consumer. They have a working demo truck. They have a factory they bought from GM. They have 40,000 fleet preorders. They got acquired by a SPAC in September, so they‚Äôre sitting on $675 million reserves to get things in order. 

They‚Äôre targeting first deliveries for next September which would put them as first to market with an EV truck.
Cut in half Tuesday
An order I placed got filled because I forgot to cancel so lost all my gains for the day ü§õüòÅüôè
Don‚Äôt get caught holding the bag.
Somebody tell me when the FSR top is so I can take my winnings and leave. I‚Äôm scared
More like $160
Zm could you stop weighing down my portfolio?
Volume off a cliff. Time for some serious drilling.
Fuckin Baba taking my EV tendies. :(
Right here! 

I just looked, I can‚Äôt even buy the calls right now for what I own it at and yet my asshole is as wide as the Grand Canyon.

Dude, at least in America, most people don‚Äôt even know how to do long division on paper, have fun relying on them understanding probabilities.
I have so many limit buys waiting for any sort of drop...
[deleted]
not if you got in at 38 a whole 3 days ago retard
It's not about the sentiment fren, sentiment only gives you initial screener for pump and dump.  It's about the company, it's industry, etc.  TSLA had similar sentiment first time it hit 420 what feels like a lifetime ago
Gonna be nice to be cash gang going into next week when EVERYTHING will be on sale
Got out of my NVDA and ZM calls at open without taking a loss.

I don't feel good about either right now. NVDA is being hit by AMZN and AAPL making their own chips in house. We'll probably see some kind of rally before earnings, but it's too risky imo.

ZM is being hit by vaccine hype in light of how heavy it dropped on PFE news. Earnings are coming up and I'll consider reentering under 400.
Nio puts printing
I‚Äôm sleepy but the portfolio is too red for me to take a nap during trading hours

Life is so quiet now. I feel like my common sense is being contradictive, yet colder for it.
Zoom weeklies r eating me alive td
Car looks fucking stupid
Following
Nope. It‚Äôs up 400% since March. It‚Äôs overvalued. SP 500 rejected them bc of sus balance sheet. It‚Äôs a fraudulent company. It is worth maybe $100. Trading at 4 times that how can it go on a run. Look at the last 2 months of trading
Elon is still trying to self-justify acting like covid was just the flu back in the spring. Not very engineer-ly of him.
I did!
NIO HEADED TO $35
Let‚Äôs see zm drill to 300 today
You‚Äôre right bro, I should be happy with any profit. Gotta switch up my mindset, thanks. Have a good one and let‚Äôs make some more money üòº
Me
Tim Apple taking my tendies all week
Almost had it!
Not gonna buy nio puts because I can't exit them before the weekend
We gonna have a WMT pump next week for earnings?
im killing it on NIO but i made the same mistake with Tesla and sold it off at a small profit for some other trash stocks a few yrs ago.

I like to accumulate assets when they are low and not play price and time games with options.

Just keep on the lookout for the next opportunity in the right industry.

Private space industry, Distributed ledger technology, Renewable energy these industries are going to 100x in the next 15 years. keep your eyes peeled for the hype company in these industries
Guess I‚Äôll buy Baba at 240
TSLA fans got out and gonna wait for substantial news on Berlin, Batteries and Deliveries.
Is solo fucked? Lololol
Who ? Panama jack?
XPEV, LI AND NIO PUTS BOUT TO EAT
Why TF are my PLTR calls that expire today worthless when it‚Äôs up 7% what the hwll
imagine if you could gamble stonks on dkng?
BIGC Goldman dump
I'm in this fight with you bro. Bought yesterday again thinking, "264, what an amazing entry."

\*opens acct this morning

GUHHHH

Anyways, this WILL go up. it's just a matter of when
!remindme 1 week
Do we still think HCAC has potential
lol i bought 100 shares as it rose and then sold them asap when it dove deep. i lost about $40.....

i fomo'd and panic sold because it started dropping. im only sticking to blue chip stocks like NIO for example. theres not much info or potential with SOLO if you really dig deep... NIO on the other hand is a different story.

maybe i will regret pulling out at the end of the day, but meh. ill stick to NIO if were doing EV's...
best thing about getting premium is seeing the stonk move against you expiration day but time is on the seller's side üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I took an L on all 3 snkr drops today :/
BABA killing me. Any chart freaks know where the low for BABA is.

FSR  üöÄ  üöÄ
Lol.. As NIO was mooning a couple of weeks ago and SOLO was still in the mid 2‚Äôs I thought to myself: what if I bought some 2021 calls? Naaah.. up 300% now of course.
Well, I have 200K worth of calls and I‚Äôm down 25K so yeah
JPM trading metals again ?
Bro, MSFT went from $200 to $220 like a week or so ago.  Maybe 2.  That was a big enough move to cash in on.
Rip PTON
10x 12/18 70c. LI had lackluster earnings and mooned. Pushing the bottom like on what everyone and anyone is willing to start investing in EV. It‚Äôs the new wave and big money is starting to all realize this is it. ICE is dying. NIO will have the best earnings out of all of the Chinese EV over the last week and completely explode. I mean. Like 70-80 explode. Don‚Äôt doubt your vibe.
Yea. Jack Ma knew better than to speak out against the CCP.
Tried as well to get those sacais. Fuck sneakers app.
I have a NIO call right now, and had one last week, made some $$ but at this point I‚Äôll probably lose it back
Both
Guys nio
Always knew you were a girl

You definitely throw like one
I have puts, but no, this will keep going up.
[deleted]
I remember the üçã article on SHOP years ago where it dropped for like 2 days and people were panicking, and then it proceeded to gain 150+% in the following month. This is a non-issue.
[deleted]
do you want to own some land, or a house on that land?
NIO 45 EOD
I got my last 1K in options. Doing shares with the rest now.
NKLA mooned afterwards and since nio isn't rolling its cars downhills I'm confident Citron is dumber than people on here.
Whos getting fucked by zoom?
See you on Monday
When you buy the dip ... BUT IT KEEPS DIPPING
Hope your position isn‚Äôt too big come the cut in half Tuesday
All in on chewy. Back to 70 EOM
[deleted]
I have questions
[deleted]
Their research is also pooptastic
[deleted]
[deleted]
To SELL as if we are in a PANIC is pretty common sense. SPY is RED so SELL is what I would do as this DIPS
See you monday
TDOC what‚Äôs going on bby?
NIO look out below !
That‚Äôs the fattest NIO dip ive seen and you idiots aren‚Äôt going to buy....
Probably not but we‚Äôll see
June? Lmao
You made money. Literally wasting emotions thinking about lost gains. Be happy you won.
If I had a weak hand in NIO I‚Äôd be thinking about getting out, this thing is due for a hefty pullback and shitron has catalyzed many of those in the past
NIO had a small dip like this yesterday before reaching a new high

This is the last discount you guys are gonna get so don‚Äôt waste it
But the question is whether XPEV and Li will follow suit?  They already reported.
[deleted]
just healthy profit-taking....watch it climb back up soon
WHAT ARE YOU DOING. GO BUY EV STOCKS RIGHT FUCKING NOW STOP BITCHING GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER. YOU'RE LITERALLY TYPING THIS PARAGRAPH, YOU COULD HAVE BOUGHT 50 CENT SOLO OPTIONS 12/18 IT WENT UP 400% IN 1 MINUTE LOL STOP SULKING GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER. OPPORTUNITIES ONLY COME WHEN YOU LOOK FOR THEM
Sell it now!
Leaps
Jesus fucking christ do I just cut my losses on BABA at this point? Shares at 287 and don't want to sink more cash into this position
Please explain your astute analysis for what happened with Tesla then? Seems like you just can‚Äôt believe it and are trying to apply some sort of false logic
You‚Äôre a bit late
No FOMO
elon has covid
NIO ran outta gas.
Retard
covid resurgence this weekend. Load up on SPY puts
I sold mine and bought shares
Dumb kids and bored women

Like most apps if it went away nothing would be lost
If you are cool selling and not looking at it then do it. I just don't think it makes sense to buy leaps and sell on small dips that probably barely dented your potential gains
[deleted]
never
I‚Äôm on calls retard I was implying your a pussy for buying shares. I‚Äôll buy you ps5 when I come over your house to see your momüòò
How far out?
Not necessarily. With all medical testing, whether a positive test increases the likelihood you have the disease/illness depends on the prevalence in the general population and the sensitivity of the test.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-bayess-theorem-an/
Even next week. Kinda too far.

As soon as I breakeven am out of chinese stocks. I advice you do the same.

Just not worth the headache quite frankly.
I‚Äôm never playing options again
I always sell woth a trailstop to avoid exactly this
Don‚Äôt let the Nio haters poison your mind and rob you of your gainz! Happened to me twice but I‚Äôm back in
Let's be honest. Nobody cares today as everyone is too busy trying to make money off of NIO to actually do their due diligence of research and assess if the company itself is right for investing properly.
Alright, let‚Äôs see those 0DTE PLTR put losses for betting against the deep state
Bought 2 11/13 $50c NIO calls yesterday at like .64, pussied out as soon as I could make profit. Got in again around .80. Pissed myself all night until I woke up this morning to robinhood telling me $51 in pre market, sold at 3.60 and 3.80. Wish I could‚Äôve gone in deeper but I‚Äôm broke
stop being a fucking pussy and buy more calls.
get AMD for graphics card drop on the 18th
Jack ma needs to finish his reeducation already.
Been inching up all week and it tanks as soon as I buy calls. Uncanny
You stop whining like a bish and then break out the fun coupons
Don‚Äôt buy the dip lmao not today
Me too
Buy more nio, can't go tits up
dumb
[removed]
Just Google their "vehicle" lol. Nio is selling real cars by the tens of thousands in a country with 1.6 billion people that wants to go 1/4 electric by 2025, solo has one of the ugliest vehicles ever made by man.
If nio hits 50.00 I‚Äôm locking my gains
^(gay)
Puts are printing
No, its pumped when for a pullback! Look for around 13! That shiwt was doing same thing whole summer from 18 to 11 and back to 18! W8, trust me! Too high for a prototype vehicle!
Msft is the biggest cuck. Hasn‚Äôt moved in like 3months
Yessir
That‚Äôs a fact. Fucked everyone
I know a guy that knows someone, who became a very very rich man doing that.
Also love the new Ranger! I‚Äôd take a bronco and ranger tmrw.
Don‚Äôt trip this the dip
TSLA is going into my ass blackhole deep
>PLTR

It needs to break the 16.6 resistance  LETS GET IT

I‚Äôm all in on these, hopefully puts around 41 today and phat gap up for Monday then don‚Äôt hold it till expiry ofc, it‚Äôll be in the money when u sell it

Whoever bought SOLO at +50% after hearing one random person on the internet tell you to deserves to lose money
Yes
anyone that like explaining things wanna tell me what a debit spread is and when its most useful
Jack made a powerful enemy
dam you right. how much % gains u make?
Yes it‚Äôs scary but this is also I think what happened with TSLA. I was up 200% yesterday and pulled out at 150% (small play so don‚Äôt think I made a lot lol)
What if they have only 4 Xbox in every store which is what I experienced.
I‚Äôm long gme by the way

PANIC SELL NIO ITS GOING TO 30 EOD

just poverty and no part time jobs thanks to covid
Not a day to buy the dip on ev

I have. He seems like a good person and I like him. Elon is Elon tho. Plus it was a joke not a personal attack against your dad
Ok taking your advice at face value and buying solo puts
[deleted]
Is it legal for Tesla to be doing this all week?
Cramer says musk is wrong lol
Bruh the DIP
I‚Äôm dumb bought at 53/share I‚Äôm down 4% I‚Äôm dumping it if it goes -10%
[deleted]
Are you serious? This has all been a massive run up for NIO earnings. They‚Äôre going to release and be identical to XPEV, and they‚Äôre gonna get cut down to the same market cap as XPEV in a massive value drop. Good luck.

If you think there are any earnings numbers that justify this 20%+ climb with no news.... good luck.
Get out
Basically the same boat. Don't let the rich guys here from good families and connections get to you.
heres another NIO dip that'll make you wish you weren't a gay bear
Literally waiting for this
Thanks man
My order on SNKRS app didn‚Äôt go thru and I sold my NIO calls yesterday, what a sad day üò¢
PLTR shares in like 5 years
Maybe not. I think we got a bit before any rug pull happens IMO
Haha it's okay. I've never had such a theta strat move against me in this way esp given how news related it is.

For now am just not going to look at my portfolio and see where it is at expiration (next week)
Lmao this
Thinking aboot going long on HYLN. Dumb or no dumb?
Door dash wants to go public
HOW TF IS SPY UP

DIE SPY DIE
only bought 1 20c 11/20 , if I had known it'd continue to moon I would of went all in lol but instead I use the majority of funds to get a 68c 12/4 NIO call so win win tbh
I think Robinhood sells it an hour before close actually? But thanks!
Holding calls; what else is new
AAPL calls
No shit. The crash will be biblical
Why is NIO falling should I sell?
Guess you are pissed your puts didnt print. Good old fashioned WSB's way. At least you are at home retard <3
Citron gotta ruin it all
FSR FSR FSR
:(
I sold everything cuz i panicked yesterday before close, pretty happy with the decision secured a 50% gain
Imo Razer is really undervalued right now while Corsair is kind of overvalued for a company that doesn't make their own products. They just slap on the Corsair brand but it's manufactured by others.
How was it bad? I was listening to the live call and they far exceeded expectations and said they‚Äôre ‚Äúvery positive about future outlook‚Äù
Fuk descending triangle on AMAZON ......shitttt thats what i get for yoloing into it.
What date? 11/16?
Is this actually true? Literally everything I've ever thought about China economically has turned out to be a lie, it always seems too good to be true until it is
I'm waiting for Monday hoping for a selloff to buy more. If not, I'll just buy at whatever it's priced at that point.
How long till they make an EV shitcoin?
[removed]
Check the citron research about NIO, there price tag is 25$
TSLA can start jelqing its way back to $500 again, that would be neat
I bought an Call yesterday and Robinhood never cancled it about 2hrs later... wtf was thst? I lost a lot of potential gains.
Daily reminder that BABA can suck a fat cock
buying the fucking dip
PLTR put holders' anuses prolapsing all over the place
Damn it‚Äôs just under 16 too lol good luck, I don‚Äôt see it going drastically up
best description of a car ive ever seen

People need places to put their money in uncertain times. They choose what they see as the future, which is tech and green energy. Has nothing to do with fundamentals, but simply people choosing their piggy banks.
Retard
BABA ‚ÄúI can go lower!‚Äù
Setting a limit buy for 360c‚Äôs
My nio 0dte puts will make up for some of the bullish action I've missed out on
nio already went past 50 you are a bit late
Yeah I‚Äôve been buying since $6 and averaging up ever since. I‚Äôd rather average down than give up this cost average
Can't stop, won't stop!
Can you elaborate this a bit more? Did you buy like 30 minutes before close or what?
Is it just me or do you think tesla will soon run again after this consolidation?
deploying at lunchtime
too many exponential stonks imo
[deleted]
Isn‚Äôt the entire point of leaps that they‚Äôre... long term?
[deleted]
Xpev better moon with nio today
Citron doesn't exactly have a great track record and these are things that anyone with stakes in NIO should have already been considering.  One thing to keep in mind is that Andrew Left, the guy running Citron, is a short seller. Do with that what you will.
Yes
[deleted]
If it goes to 54-55 and does well AH. Oh yeah definitely

I‚ù§Ô∏èu Nio
My PLNT puts are up 30+% even though the stock is still above 70.

Still plenty of time to get puts in. It routinely goes back under 65 whenever it rises above 70, but now there's an actual catalyst (impending lockdowns)
YOLO OR BAN
...damnit
NIO bulls pls come back
And moron Stanley has $75 price target on Tesla. Should I buy puts on Elon?

Yup, pulled my cash off the market this week, fuck the noise
Nio heading back to 42.0
Every 10K or 20K milestone I tell myself I want to buy something really nice for myself but I can't stop re-investing it
I‚Äôm gonna make some lunch, NIO at $60 when I‚Äôm done
So what now?  Ma‚Äôs gotta bend ove like LeBron?
Yea but NKLA was a fraud from the start
I bought SOLO near the peak today, fml
Should have held my spy puts
You'll be more than fine
FUCK! Missed buying the 1/21/22  60C for $12 now it's fucking 19...story of my life!
Wow LOOK HERE WE GOT A RATIONAL FUCKING PERSON.
Just shorted it for the first time today. Everyone way too bullish here, that‚Äôs my only reasoning
AMZN has lost me an insane amount of money this fall no matter which way I try and trade it.
Just the dudes that have called out every fake company for the last 5 years
Citron research can suck my 2 inch dick. Losers probably tried to get in low.
Just buy stock and hold forever. 10 bagger in 5 years
baba guh
Idk I should sell my baba 330 March leap. Down 60% and baba losing every day since I bought it
LOL @ Disney. It was priced to perfection I guess
When we selling man?

weird how i‚Äôve become so desensitized to the losses, would‚Äôve been going ballistic back in march
Yeah but if I sell a call way otm and it hits that price I‚Äôll limit my profit by a lot. Could‚Äôve made so much more today if the $58 calls I sold 3 days ago didn‚Äôt go up by $300 each
Dang, you be making money money, mine is $36

When you double down after double downing, and then your limit sell to make profit misses by 0.01 and then tanks so you lose quadruple

im sorry bro
Nio is about to get pumped. Earnings on the 17th. Get in while you can. Discount Dip Deals going on right now dummies
Yeah same. Sold two, kept one. Doing great but want to complain about the what if.

Anybody else buy the BABA ‚Äúdip‚Äù last week? I‚Äôm fuk
solo has huge jet potential, hasn't even mooned as much as nio yet
is TSLA really worried about the chinese EVs?  I guess it's inevitable that IP will be stolen from them in china
[deleted]
Xi is just making a point. It'll recover

I think we can all agree on nio to $60 next week
Is your bf asking for anal
Where my V at ev?!
When to sell nio? Monday or tues?
[deleted]
XPEV 50c 11/20
NIO will hit at least $55 for earnings, come kiss our butts
tsla went from 170 to 2k in 1 year, nio and the rest are just trying to catch up
SRAC/MNTS gonna be lit in the new year
I luckily got into NIO pretty early but there‚Äôs always going to be another meme stock to play with soon. I‚Äôd stay cash until then, NIO maybe going up but this sub is fickle
I knew it at the time well I actually bought it a couple times on the way down. Then it shoots right up and you're like well it will eventually drop again and it doesn't and you just watch it leave without you... Scared money don't make money
Holy, SOLO's logo is a bull. all the DD I need to go all in. 

Also there cars look ugly as shit tbh. Would not ride
Alright ZM... I know you want to return to your former glory where you went up no matter what. Get moving you bitch
Had a feeling o should of unloaded BABA when it was up 3 in pre market. Oh well
Solo
Middle class bigger than the US and Chinese government backing + pledge to make all vehicles electric by 2035.

If anything NIO is still undervalued atm
bought baba at the top and of course dumbass jack ma has to challenge the fucking cccp. retard
Uh oh. Citron hit piece on NIO. Going to end up like NKLA.
I'm going to lease a Fisker tomorrow
[deleted]
2T company....
yes
why invest in literally anything else right now
The gain on the 16C 11/13 i sold is hopefully going to be 100%
Fuckin hammering call debit spreads week of earnings. Smd NIO shills.
Fucking Baba piece of shit why did i even play that shit again
That‚Äôs kind of amazing
stocks been up 30% in 2 days idk
Corsair over Razer every day. Razer computers are essentially welfare computers.
Shhh
My greedy ass Diamond handing my 3$ AMC puts that expire today like they‚Äôre worth something lmao
At this point just flip a coin every time you coof.
Ha Citron cannot pierce NIOs armour, barely a scratch

on to a 1000!!
Selling $BABA 270 puts before this huge drop will go down as one of my worst moves this year..... or not idk :-(

Why would you sell any leaps right now
FSR üöÄüöÄüöÄ
hold
I‚Äôm forcing myself to hold through today because I sold pre-10am twice in the last two weeks on calls that went on to double their value. Already halved my position at 9:55, so this really is an exercise of the mind at this point.
Sell. Look at what they make lol it‚Äôs trash and the company has no potential unlike the Chinese EVs or Tesla
Mannn can‚Äôt wait for these Chinese EV companies to go back to their 6 month average after this moon so Tim Apple üçè can go back to mooning.
Whats the PTLR entry price to aim foe
So you're telling me baba 300 11/27 call was a bad idea... Okay. You keep your secrets.
If BABA goes below 258, it‚Äôs testing 240.
I‚Äôm thinking the same , what strike you have in mind ?
I fomo‚Äôd yesterday and made 2.5k on a 770 investment
That was my plan but I pussied out

you think MM's going to let the price keep at 50 today.
\^The hero we need
What percentage are you up my dude?
I've banished him to no-touchy island along with Elon after this week
It's somewhat amazing that missing out on making more money on something feels worse than losing money betting the wrong way.

I just sold half of my SOLO stock after it went up 100% for me, but i am furious and feel absolutely shit that i had such a little position on it.
SOLO fomo ?
If I roll forward 100% of my profits and if it dips even 10%, I still feel bad. Wtf brain, get your shit together.
I need a guaranteed 10 bagger play
Nobody buying the BABA dip? How fucked are my 300 june calls?
Ah yes, the overt brag about money and possessions while all you pseudo-macho types eat it up.  When will you over-testeroned man-children realize that everybody on Readdit laughs at you because of your brazen vulgar language and frequent posts about your money and possessions.  Although the penile size in this sub is miniscule, the brags are monstrous.  It's pathetic and weak and I would be laughing in your pretentious faces if I ever see you in person.

Both
small office/home office?  yes
It will likely go much higher by earnings. Just relax
NIO puts
yeah totally unrealistic as they have 1.5 Bn plus people and 500 Million in their middle class. really I think Polestar and Volvo is the play. Sweden is on the up!
NIO will go better in long-term trust me fam. The CEO builds loyalty, he doesnt give a shit about sales. do you see the CEO of XPEV or Li doing shit?
I bought some 395c expiring next week. Hopefully it prints. My last 3 orders have killed my account
Weak hands about to be crying over the weekend again. Every week it's like this.
Don‚Äôt buy then?
I have never hated and country/stock more than I hate BABA and China
Wow tech! Just when you thought you bought the dip.

Im glad i sold zoom. Good luck to the ones holding.

So why is Twitter dying? Because ü•≠ isn‚Äôt president anymore?
I get that some people go for a brand like for example Logitech cause they are known for their quality but Razer focusses on a different audience that likes decent quality AND good looking products.

The good thing though is, the quality of their new line is great! So now they have the best of both worlds.
Of course not been when it is that fucking bad there should be some drawdown not euphoria.

How low it can go?
Because its a fucking iPad on a stationary bike
Did you read about the SPAC merger ?
I thought 260 was. At this rate its 250.
*the stock I‚Äôm playing dips .5%*
‚ÄúLet me check the wsb daily thread to see what the experts are saying*
You mean selling them? Earning is next week and I don‚Äôt see it heading below 50 anytime soon
Leaps
NVAX up, ZM down, PTON down. 

Someone knows something. Vaccine release likely, gonna git ZM call holders rekt

One day trade left what‚Äôs the $600 play to flip
*yawn* 360 EOD
Did you buy 11/20 weeklies? Bad idea, but if you have longer dates, you'll be fine. I bought two 2/19 $10c for pretty cheap, I'll see where it goes
If NIO falls below 50 I‚Äôll buy leaps.....otherwise I‚Äôm waiting for earnings and hope it sells off a bit. Still holding shares though. FSR breaking 20 would be nice.
Lots of profit taking ahead of the weekend Moderna vaccine news pump, gonna get some cheap spy lottos for Monday
I bought solo at the peak should i hold or sell?

Plus lockdown and shit with more coming Monday. Guaranteed to sell down.
Is anyone going to listen to me about $FSR?
What calls.should i buy?
Solo and SOL rippin‚Äô
know your audience, this isn't /r/florida
Got enough thanks to the weak hands post earnings, just gonna hold this no matter what.
lmao all good chief! i did that my first time too
I think I want to get off Mr. BABA's wild ride :(
SPY always the best
Earnings was bad they just jumped because of the EV hype. I wouldn't.
DKNG flat for the last half hour, are we setting up for a pump or a dump
Till you‚Äôre ITM!
Anyone doing 0 day puts for the close today?
Every things getting cut. How do you think they will pay for stimulus???
I feel ya. Bought 100 shares at 3.27 and sold at 4. And I sold my $40 call Monday morning.
Good shii man
At least for now. I don't have any positions but the valuation doesn't look sustainable
LI hitting 50 end of day, buy while you can.

Bears trapped in nio in 3.2.1
Citron is wrong more often than the autist here. That's probably why the stock went up after this.
This is your captain speaking... the seat belt light is now on. Everyone please remain in your seats this could be a bumpy ride
Say it out loud, Priced In!
PLTR mothafuckaaaa
Hard not to feel like a fuckin genius today.  Short TSLA, long SBE and PLTR
Is NIO gonna hit a new HOD today?
Bought a 0DTE on PDD. The high from chasing 0DTE is better than any drug
Bears want to bet against an entire industry, supported by a govt that is pushing the country to Be EV by 2025 oh yea with the most polluted cities in the world
What the fire burns, we will find in the ashes.

People been saying that for weeks
I need that kind of support in my lifeü§ß
Better get some Palantir calls so that you can afford a good looking wedding ring bro
The business is completely fine, this is just investors being retarded. The regulations if anything will be good for BABA.

They rightfully wanted to reign in Ant because it was acting as an unregulated bank.

Unfortunately Ma got up on stage and spouted his mouth of about state banks being awful and regulators fucking everything up so they came down super hard on Ant and now that is rippling through everything even though it should have no fucking effect on BABA at all minus their stake in Ant.
Yeah. Time for SPY weekly poots. This is tarded.
Please
Dear MMs keep JPM below 115 plz
Pro tip: if you sell at a loss, you'll never have to pay capital gains tax.
Righto bucko! Holding 3 sets of puts. 11/20 50 48 38 in case it dumps today or gaps to the floor Monday.
NIO over 50 is dancing on top of a cliff, just gimme 30 and I'll jump back in
Consumer sentiment misses by 10 percent... you had all the time in the world to sell

Wtf amazon
Why do I think TSLA is dipping while NIO and SOLO are soaring just because Elon has covid
should i get the li dip? this is insane
FSR really just doesn't have red days does it
Good old 10:30. Where the bears come out to play. Never fails.
Hold and buy more
I'm up 10k on nio leaps in a week I think I might just take my profit..

Fuck you zoom you stupid fucking rebranded Skype
Seems weird that Nasdaq and Russell have a pretty large negative correlation now. I think of you start to see a sustained rally in small caps it could be pretty bad for mega cap tech and the market overall as it destabilizes that trade
Sitting on gains from NIO, Li, and XPENG feels like being in a foursome with three hot chicks.
This is the comment you‚Äòre looking for when you‚Äòre asking at 3pm why the fuck nobody said anything about SOLO when it was still single digit.

550% eod
This stock fucking made everyone money.
Alright, serious question now! Does any of you fellow friends, see soho as decent investment, 1 I can leave for a year and wake up one day and its 40?!

Sold out of all of my AAPL while I still have gains. Will try to start accumulating when it's around $110
Might be a good time to plug walk again. 25c 11/20
I‚Äôm gonna buy BABA puts so it starts going up
Anything bullish on NIO lmao
Hold my hand?!
going to try covered calls- any recommended stocks to try it out with?

FUCK
Y‚Äôall really think NIO is gonna dump before earnings ü§£ü§£ü§£
They don‚Äôt have any production capabilities last I checked. I‚Äôm only holding 10 shares. Pretty skeptical for now.
Man I‚Äôm thinking the same thing right. Down 66% on my BABA December calls and don‚Äôt know if to throw in the towel.
guys do you think medium term nio investing is real? i mean 2022 leaps and shares. Don‚Äôt want to sell now because i have no alternative ideas(aside of pltr and boomer stocks, but i am already balls deep in them)
Fuck i bought solo at the peak should i hold or sell
Doesn't really mean anything
Money on the floor lets get straight to it
Dec 18 is a long ways to go
BABA üò≠
God damn Zoom. I trusted you
What‚Äôs your point, Boomer
DIS puts printing
why is pton dumping
good game amazon!
and Monday.
Lmfao not close, but im working towards it... :)
People may sell before earnings because they know it is about to crash. This happens pretty frequently, people hold until the last moment before an incoming risky inflection point/volatile day. The selling right before the volatility of earnings can cause downward pressure unless there is a good reason to believe earnings will be good.

Caveat: I know nothing about NIO and I am staying far away from it because it's just gambling with no analysis and I miss like 2-4 years ago when this sub did analysis to actually get an edge.
I bought the NIO dip now what? MM dumps?
NIO calls are getting too expensive for me. It was fun while it lasted...
TSLA is slowly bleeding out and someone needs to take it out to the pasture and finish the job
This chinese ev spam is so fucking annoying
Retest of 54 incoming
Nio puts is the way
Depends. If you don‚Äôt know could hold half and sell half.
Holding these NIO calls through the 10am sell off is making me sweat.
lol China literally congrats Biden's win 1 day after donny banned chinese stock
Weak hands shake out for mm to get in cheaper
for the love of fucking god I hope so

okay boys that was the dip, if we believe in ourselves we can get NIO to 69 by earnings

Thank u NIO for another fire sale üôè
DISNEY CALLS ü•µ
I'll give you my reply to your deleted post if you don't mind. Let me know if your want me to nuke it:

Right. Sounds logical. And useful. I have some innate skepticism cause somehow I think others must've figured this out? Dunno. Maybe they keep it to themselves

So that info is contained in that read we were talking about earlier?

Asking the real questions here
Jesus christ NIO and LI with the fake dump. Bear trap at it's finest
Ford seems to understand stand the current car market. They have all the best min maxed vehicles in a number of places and have completely pulled out of making sedans. Also the new bronco had enormous hype and they beat expectations. Ita going to steal a ton of sales from jeep. If the electric f150 isn't a flop they will do well.

True! I got 2 January calls that are balancing each other out one positive one negative.. that expiration was probably to soon.. not sure how much longer to hold for though
I would like to quote Buffet on NIO right now. BTDF.
Why is apple falling again..
Hopefully our day is soon because this expiration isn‚Äôt too long
Big brain over here!
Who has the bigger dick?
I would nut
wow where is baba's floor
SOLO to $10
SOLOs dio is over
BABA just needs to buy an EV company that hasnt gone public real quick.
Actually, puts on ZM and PTON. Both are going to extinction
chips and DIP
Solo dip
Bought SOLO at even higher than the top. Buy high, SOLO they say :D
so tempted for a leap w January 2021 exp, somethings gotta give
So.....HYPOTHETICALLY if I YOLO‚Äôd my whole portfolio into Chinese EV companies midway through the top today on slightly OTM calls expiring mid December I would be fucked correct?
Yes
PLTR & LI making me rich. I think I'll just leave them for a few months and come back. Either I can retire, either I still have my job.
I bought some NIO puts at $45-6

They all still green. ü§°

edit as a hedge of course I have calls
You rang?
I don't have positions in NIO, but 2 years ago Citron said the same about SQ...
Please be right hoss
why buy puts after that dump?
It is
I bought the nio dip! let‚Äôs see what happens
Scared money doesn't make money.

When to buy NIO dip...
is it just me or is this the same pattern as yesterday for nio
Nobody gives a fuck about lil uzi or bullshit like this
Autist levels of genius
Closed December calls for 160% profit, opened 0dte 52c FDs at what I hope was the days bottom. Let‚Äôs go NIO
So is BABA completely fucked?  Piss of Winnie the Pooh then get the axe?  Doesn‚Äôt Xi get that‚Äôs bad for business?
The virus just makes PLTR stronger üí™
Seriously every post I see on NIO is setting off my REEDar.
Wow that‚Äôs like 5x my account and I‚Äôm out here trying to solve my student debt
No
If you entered Nio this morning at +11% you deserve it tbh
How to lose money: Buy NIO and panic sell when it dips lol. 

The volume will be 350mil by EOD
I don‚Äôt get it. spy up but tech down. Explain.

thats the right move! NIO's more stable. I secured my bag from Li already ‚òòÔ∏è
I‚Äôm bullish
NIO dump incoming!
Hold 12/18 baba 300c that have been bleeding since I bought them this week?
In my delinquent account, I turned 1k into 30k this year (5k-30k in the last two weeks). Just withdrew 20k to start some projects and fund a business venture, and leaving 10k in to try it again. Got an exit on a company coming up so I'm just looking for play money in the meantime. This is all way less stressful when you don't make it life or death.
looks like we might be going to 255.80ish
Bro honestly ive lost 20k on them in the past week wtf......... I am literaly going to kill my self if my account doesnt rebound. Shit needs to moon to 3.5k asap
dumping on low volume means good pump to follow, right?
FVRR,great job.
dam i hate bein sober
2% pull back after being up over 7%, yeah no... 

Buy puts if you‚Äôre so sure!
Last chance of NIO dip
Yeah too much uncertainty with the tech regulation and by the time it‚Äôs resolved your call might be dead
DO NOT PANIC SELL NIO

Sprich deutsch du hurensohn
Im holdin on.
And now you're a nio millionaire.
BABA what the ACTUAL FUCK
29 is the strike price
Itm always has a higher chance of being profitable, well usually I should say, unless they are insanely inflated. Get as close to itm as you can afford, the vast majority of the time. It's pretty rare for stocks to act like nio, that shits on crack, a 20% otm call, especially weeklys many times won't make you money, at least not at exp, though you may be able to flip it for a profit if the underlying pops in value.
It has a little trunk she can squeeze into
Same.

If I buy in, it will tank immediately.
Still going up

Killing me for months. Thankfully I only have shares, just going to wait it out.
Amazinggggg dip to buy $PTON right now, this always goes up when Covid cases are on the rise, for obvious reasons, more at home exercising

I think it‚Äôs time to get into gme again
4 horsemen of China EV are Nio, Xpev, Li, Tsla.
Anyone else fomo into NIO at the top ü§°
I haven‚Äôt even thought about selling these shares
Never was
You mean Ath*
Tsla dying
TSLA 400c good play for next week?
My NIO 40Ps that I bought yesterday when NIO was at 48.5 are up 5% lol. These premiums are wild
Old news, not EV's or eCommerce. Doesn't go into effect 11/2021 when he's not chief LOL
holding 5000 long. 

Lots of jan 15 43c

Things can only be parabolic for so long before they need to ctfo.  Earnings coming up soon though.
I mean, its straight printing so far.
[removed]
Something fishy going on with NIO. My 40 and 45 puts I bought yesterday are about to turn green. Stock is still booming yet puts are getting greener?
Singular pointy nipple pattern on spy - confirmed we are about to get milked
Dirt cheap.  I bought in yesterday.
Citron w the hit piece on NIO. Oof
We will have our day.
Coz all EVs are mooning and this one is lagging
Yeah, but I didnt have more money and my ass is sore.
Just sold my 1/15/21 50c and my shares for a nice profit. See a pullback in the near future, gonna stay away until their ER next week.
Wow, that must have been a fun ride up. Congrats!
[deleted]
ICLN is a beauty. Easy to read. Super predictable. Free tendies on long calls
To the core of the earth
Is it weird that I‚Äôm bullish on Ford over the next 5 years?
lol stocks don't move at a 90 degree vertical you tards...they come back down a little and climb again. smh
Fisker worth billions right now with ZERO cars produced let alone sold. Really want to buy OTM puts
Right now, definitely. They just pushed news it was Xi that personally blocked the Ant IPO. This has no material effect ofcourse but it will send stocks into the shitter regardless.
Enough with the fucking OTC stonks :(
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY üí∞
In on this play as well.
tech in free fall but spy not moving
NIO rug pull.
Apple attempting to find earth's core
Just a joke. But it does feel like the EV market is starting to even a little closer. Interesting so see who is going to be the long term winner
me
Honestly. i want to join in but don‚Äôt know when the best time the premiums will decrease.
Baba in the 250s now
Bye nio lol
Very cool! Now go plant and water it so you can add *growth* to your portfolio.
Fucking AAPL.... fucking fuck. :(
My boys üê† and ü™ë having a nice day out there üòé
Apple pulling down the qqq. What an arsehole.
Why would I pay 18k for a single person car

Guess if you have no friends or SO and destine to be forever alone it‚Äôs perfect
I actually feel kinda bad I insulted the designers. Still a decent idea
NIO can't have bad earnings (they prob cook the books)
How much do you pay upfront for that put? $2900
which one of you cucks bought SOLO as a fomo at the top of $7.9? Speak up
Pton no longer cool guys.
The amount of times I‚Äôve heard this...
Nio up 100% this month? that's organic growth and if you think otherwise than you're a racist.
Post saved.
Can we do this week again next week I‚Äôve been having fun.
[removed]
Seem like it
TSLA gonna pop down to the 390s
right there with ya ü§°
Saw that early in news. Think it pertains to military.
Cmon nio gang I was promised 60 eod
Right. That‚Äôs why you sell the second they break. You might lose 5%. But they usually hold, and you gain 10-30%.
Anyone with a fuckin brain knows NIO won‚Äôt go up forever but god dammit will you please take the free money while it does?!
I'm tempted too
Took 5k profit from nio @ 40 now I‚Äôm getting fomo
jfc apple
relatable
Anyone else holding shares till the day before NIOS earnings? I‚Äôm a little spooked to hold over the weekend
[deleted]
BP $20c for April is dirt cheap. Recovery is going to continue, and Biden will limit drilling (=lower supply=higher profits). Get your EV tendies now, but get your oil tendies later
A lot of people here will be holding NIO long term by accident.
Uh oh we dumping?
40p on LI printinggggg
It‚Äôs simple. 

Buy every NIO dip.
I feel that BABA one.
[deleted]
Thanks for the info. So, when they do this reverse merger, do we know if KCAC will be straight delisted, or will you get a proportional share of QS, e.g. 1:1 KCAC -> QS?
Did you listen to the autists or the retards? Your answer determines your fate of tendies or loss porn
I sold because other plays are moving
OP username is her nickname for his dink
We are getting way too bullish lets calm down folks or MM will pull the rug.
What's the easy part? Missed out on chinese EV plays
52c 55c 11/13 let's get this to 60!
On NIO puts, I love to watch my account burn
BIGC is killing me today
So are baba calls dumb?
Yes.
Because no one else here knows shit about investing so you feel right at home

IV for Nio is fucking ridiculous. I wouldn‚Äôt touch buying short term puts or calls w a 10 foot pole. Selling is smart
Somehow Friday the 13th seems like a very appropriate time to buy PLTR
[deleted]
we just making shit up now?
Grimes Yoko‚Äôd Tesla.
We are all on a roller coaster it will shoot back up it's only 10:10
Is BABA the only Chinese stock going to shit?

Any hope for TSLA next week or should I close my put spreads before I get anally raped?
tsla feeling the heat from nio
I‚Äôve got 4300 shares, I‚Äôm going backpacking around the US for the next year and a half and when I return I shall retire a millionaire.
This is turning into another one of those 15 smegma moves that are only supposed to happen like once every billion years.
Bought SOLO at AH ‚òπÔ∏è

And if memory serves moderna is a crappy company
Well this sucks, BABA is about to drop like a rock.
I have some more capital to average down but this whole business is completely overblown and nonsense, whatever.
Can we please just kill spy? 330 would be nice
VXX will hit 22 today , just saying

False positive tests are rare for a normal PCR test, but may not be that rare for the rapid antigen test.
Tests are unreliable.

PLTR shittin on all y‚Äôall
I'm scared...not only did I BuY ThE DiP, but fomo on nio....you degenerates better be onto something

I am a bull but I am selling my calls and going to cash for the weekend.
I am not sure who is bigger retard, you guys who bought and at 7.6 or me who sold it at 6.5 and bought it at 6.2!
lmao same bro
What the 100 mile range and beautiful design don‚Äôt do it for you?
we've got some expected profit-taking sell-off, but I think due to the successes of LI and XPEV, there's gonna be a mass hysteria to get into this stock now
I was promised a pltr crash so I could buy in more

Up 50% today, the near dated OTM calls are stupid expensive right now. Waiting for a dip and then I'll jump in.
Tomorrow.....
People are conflating the claims.

\- There is no evidence from studies which says blood type makes COVID less severe, resistant, less symptomatic, etc. if you get it.

\- There is evidence from studies which says blood type is a factor in the likelihood of getting infected in the first place.

QQQ dying and IWM pumping. Looks like we're in for MRNA vaccine news Monday.
Sorry guys. Just jumped in 15 min before. Rip to your calls
Yeah I see fcel as a medium/long term play while waiting for a breakout. I think it has long term potential with Biden pushing green energy with trillions
RKT going to surprise a lot of people when it doesn‚Äôt go back down to 20 this time. Going to see lots of people jumping in when it hits 25 and FOMO starts again. Set a remind me!
CRAZY potential. Hyped
FUCKING UZI IS BACK? Ps4 day it is! Glad I got my morning scalp in.
Im out of day trades lmao..
If you lose money today quit.
Why?
Puts?
Baba is on sale they said
last time i checked they're not an EV
Can confirm $vale was shit
Compared to Tesla they are undervalued. Lol. But you‚Äôre right. I see a profit take followed by another surge these Chinese fuckers don‚Äôt play. They‚Äôre here to  stay. Tesla is the real piece of shit totally over valued
EVs are basically the Netflix of video rental. If traditional car makers like Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM etc aren't moving their R+D into EVs, theyre gonna be gone one day. Few weeks ago I read that Toyota still believes in their Hydrogen tech and won't make an EV until 2025. Eerily similar to the things Blockbuster used to say bf going bankrupt. 

Today Netflix has multiple competitors and streaming is the norm. Imagine what the EV market will look like in 5-10 yrs? 

TL:DR buy EV calls üëçüí∞
Kinda. If you read the report about Li auto earnings, it went something like this, "their earnings are very disappointing, but the stock market dont give an F. Pump it up 25% and keep going." With this in mind, I have a feeling it might be the same with Nio. It doesnt matter what numbers the earnings are. The stock market is retarded.
ü§ö
i hate how webull counts your total loss it‚Äôs retarded
I‚Äôm with you in mourning
Lmao fuck just watched that movie last weekend
Pretty much
Sold my solo around 7.50, quick in and out gain$

SOLO is just an EV born with microcephaly
TSLA get none of the fun but will get all the sell off
Not cake day. Don‚Äôt care
Nio is closing above 55 idc
Sorry, thought you were waiting for my go signal. 

Ok, sounds useful. So volatility would be as in VIX? Not sure I can get a good guess for velocity. Like gamma?
This is the bull way!
Solo‚Äôs cars look like goldmember‚Äôs car in Austin powers
XPEV 50c 11/20?
This total market hour chart is fucking wild
KNDI a good eV stock? Or just buy xpev, li & Nio?
Me lol
Ride that mothafaka to the galactic outer rim or to the ground so hard you hit shale oil.
Just imagine when these Chinese EVs are trading in the several hundreds and even thousands one day...you will look back and thank yourself for being smart.
Does it close out your positions or you just can‚Äôt enter more?
PLTR time is now

i thought spy opened down today?

 Buy the dip
Hold
So SOLO huh?  Pretty sure I can afford to wait
This aged well
Jack Ma gonna need to blow Xi on live TV to get BABA moving lmao
solo $10 eod bet
Dead how? The company is going to continue to do fantastic but it‚Äôs market cap is litterally 19x these new competitors and that‚Äôs not gonna last.  I am a Tesla believer. I‚Äôd love to own a Tesla and musk is going to continue to make that company perform. But I wouldn‚Äôt buy TSLA.
Exit what?
Sell off 1/3 bro. Secure atleast 400% gain and diversify. You‚Äôve got to prepare for boomer stock days and tech companies falling again. Having that buying power will let you buy the dips and guarantee huge gains from the rebound.
Mgm gang still here and we still lion heart ü¶Å‚ù§Ô∏è

Please go google what the fuck market cap means
FOMO is the best way to get caught with your pants down. I'd advise against putting any significant amount of money into Chinese EVs that have gone up over 2000% in only a few weeks.
Mine are 11/27 I‚Äôve never been so torn haha
Unity... It's glorious üòç
All in NIO at the top. Am I doing this right?
Here comes the FAKE DUMP
pretty much, they won some Covid/Cancer AI type contracts as well this quarter
Made a shit ton on LI at opening...promptly lost half on SOLO in 5 minutes
no one, because we aren't there yet!

Buy now if you think it's going up more today.
oof well if it makes you feel better i had 12 11/13 50c yesterday morning for .27 and sold at .40 lmao
Aapl is such a fucking disappointment to me. You can‚Äôt bribe me with a 1.44$ dividend when I‚Äôve lost one thousand times that much
Well we wouldn't want to look gay. Not that there's anything wrong with being gay, ask any wsb mod they will tell you.
If it does u still profit
By everything you mean literally just Apple and Tesla?
NIO 60 EOD and earnings might go crazy
good luck then
Why do they all go up when a competing company does good lol they cant all sell evs to everyone
TSM IS A DOG
PLTR will explode once they figure out their commercial side of their business.
this is the only NIO dip yall are gonna get
Same lol..apart from li which I'll buy soon. Feels wrong buy in it at 20%+ day
I did
Alright, who bought solo at 7.50$?
I‚Äôm up 300% on KNDI calls haha
i would assume it depends on when they expire. mine do in May, so yeah im holding
If they are unreliable, how can you say he's got the rona?

Is everyone selling BABA to jump into EV and other memes?
SOLOOOOOO
So apparently Cramer thinks that "Musk is wrong to focus on Electric" and that "Hydrogen is a great fuel."  This washed up coke monkey is trying to criticize a physicist because what...the "hydrogen" market is hot right now?  Fucking retards.
Serious question, dudes. How do you all feel about NIO being a long term hold?

Hey brother just checking in you ok?
Chinese EVs profit takings inbound
Stop limit/market or trailing stop. Not sure what TD uses. Other option is to have a mental stop and keep an eye on the stock; 2 benefits- 1)if it gaps past your stop you may not get filled(stop limit), 2)you can keep a higher sell order in so your shares can‚Äôt be lent out for someone to borrow them to short.

is 260 now low enough for BABA?
BABA SAID YEET

Hell no, shares make baby gains, I live lavish.
Iv gonna kill you anyway. Youre too late
soooooo tech, what's happening? lol
Das right
[deleted]
BABA Fell off a cliff. BABA alone took out 40% my portfolio.
Calls on Solo? Sike! No calls
Sector rotation into Chinese EV
Now if you want to X10 that money buy PLTR shares until March
Wtf Apple

Also NIO is nuts
Hell yeah! I just bought another NIO call
PLTR is the definition of legitness. Beast of a stock.
Maintenance facility at a VA hospital in Connecticut. 2 people dead from what I‚Äôm seeing on Twitter
Got out of BABA... no more china for me except NIO
LOTS of selling pressure on AAPL 0-DTE puts y'all
Last chance to buy NIO
The road to fortune is made one penny at a time.
BABA jumping off a cliff rn. RIP
I guess I‚Äôll buy this SOLO dip then
Options is basically a contract where you agree to buy the shares at a certain price on a specific date. You have the option to buy them not the obligation. If shares are now ‚Ç¨5 each and you make a call option at ‚Ç¨6 for next month, if next month the options are at ‚Ç¨8 you can buy them still at ‚Ç¨6. If they go to ‚Ç¨4 then you let the contract expire and do not buy them. Reverse principle for Put (down)
Constitutionally, no. It can go to court. It‚Äôs not over. I‚Äôve personally accepted Biden as president but it still isn‚Äôt over
Looking like baba wants to turn red on the 3 month chart.
Bumming me out too
if you do play the short side on spy (which i don't advise as it is rigged to go up) never ever hold into the overnight session. all the gains in the indices happen in the overnight session.
 NIO KNIGHTS OF PLTR ASSEMBLE
What new news is BABA dropping on?  Or just random 2 percent drop just because

I‚Äôm actually pissed that the movie got moved twice

What a time to be alive! We are in the green!
It‚Äôll go up, don‚Äôt worry
Take the profit. Could miss some gains but no looking back.

Tesla is American and when Elon brings a factory to Texas I dont want him finding out my son bought any gat dang NIO.
PLTR WAS FOUNDED BY THE FUCKING CIA THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE HUGE CONTRACTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVT, WORKING WITH OTHER GOVTS. Cyber warfare, coups all that. 

PLTR IS GOING COMMERCIAL AS WELL. 

PLTR IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE
Got 104 shares at 11.99! All time high at the time lol
Nio baby, just bought back in this morning at $53. We‚Äôre headed to $60 soon
Solo is Canadian homie
This truck runs on PLTR bear tears
I do. Support levels get broke through all the time.
PLTR is gonna be $17 before closing today.  I listened to their earnings call. They are about to take over the data infrastructure of every company.
if it cant hold above 264 today, it will drop further. wait until EOD before buy

Fuck Tim apple.
look in the bright side you at least don‚Äôt have to pay taxes this year
I‚Äôve made money off Nio but this bubble is going to burst just like Tesla did.
wow I am so bad at this
New PLTR strategy, buy calls on red days and puts on green days
No Apple will definitely go back down The question is when. It's much more likely it's going to hit 110 before 130
First they said a Democrat win would be bad because of tax raises,
Then a divided government where Biden wins but republicans keep the senate,
Now it‚Äôs a good thing,
Next they‚Äôll say a civil war is good because you have to replace all the destruction,
Next that China taking over is bullish because at least they‚Äôre not Russians,

There just seems to be no end to the street‚Äôs optimism.
I just did this for my first option, if I bought it at it's low I woulda made so much more but, still profits right?
Because the IV is insane
shit must have been horrible
When I saw Tesla skyrocket a few month ago I had no doubt NIO would follow. Just couldn‚Äôt buy any.
[removed]
I bought shares at $13 and sold at $15. You‚Äôre not alone.
Join the club
that means they are buying shares
i would like to humbly request that

Okay WSB i‚Äôve given in. Balls deep in PLTR, NIO, XPEV and Ll. 90% of my money in the market. This is how you do it right?

What‚Äôs happenin
FUV stepping up to the game and showing those old calls some green.
up 228% on my smol pp folio on the 1M. feels good bruh
you SOB I am IN!
Up 120% on my fisker 12/18 17.5c I bought yesterday
Fair enough, 30% not technically full control.  It is a vested interest in success though and still works for me.  Ali Baba got knocked in the crotch because of Jack Ma.  Nio was bailed put earlier this year so the thing Jack said about the banks being scarred when they lend you money is true here.  The CCP put their money in on Nio and are now getting paid back.  I took profit at 45 and now that I finally realized how much stake the CCP has I am back in it.  Analysts forecasts are stupid high on this and I am gonna ride this coaster some more.
I did
How oversold is BABA right now?
FOMOing into SOLO was the easiest money I've lost so far, at least I still have NIO...
Everyone's sleeping on our boy Henrik today. FSR has jumped a bit and plenty more to go.
Man I fucking hate AAPL. It's like an abusive relationship. It looks like it's getting better and back on track and then nah.
Self made. I use to work as a commodities trader. Now I just trade for myself. 

Back in the days we shoot from the hip all the time. Pure autism in that industry. Although machines with their unlimited funds r starting to run us out of the business when I quit a few years back.
buy shares and learn options front to back before you throw that $1000 away.
I jumped on the solo bandwagon... yall are fucked it literally started tanking after I bought.

Sorry bitches
Scalped 60Cs at open for  a quick +100%

Probably left money on the table by end of day. But since its so OTM lol no interest in diamond handing shit. I'll leave that to those with bigger cashstacks.

Might look for a more ITM entry soon - fucking glad I exited when I did. Volatility is a beautifully terrifying  thing. 

Scalpers careful you don't treat your 5 min scalp plays like full 4 hr day trades. Subtle but very important difference - see above for volatility.

Is it possible that loans can be at 10% because the lenders providing these loans know that they you cannot escape the loans and the government is backing them? If you remove that, the rates will go down. The incentives of each party--lender and borrower--will find their equilibrium. Right now there is a gorilla weighing things down in favor of the lender and poorly educated kids are getting into these loans and fucking themselves because lenders cannot be counted on the be virtuous... they're in business.
I told yall to buy at the bottom yesterday...easy money
I would leave my wife if she gave 50k to absolutely anyone for free
they release next week...look at what happened to both XPEV and LI after release. If you're ITM, you should see good gains.

We should just change the name of the sub to NIO & SOLO street bets..FFS!
Chinese EVs ü§Øü§Øü§Ø Sweet baby Jesus
The Chinese prefer Tesla as it is considered higher end even if the price is cheaper.
i think there heading towards 110 and will retest. If they can bounce back they can probably break 120.
Try learning what support levels are, and buy at support. Works at least... idk 75% of the time.
The walking dead stock. Biggest bullshit stock man.
You can keep going until the end of the day then at market close you will be marked, happened to me a month ago, two more months until I can trade again

You should read EO12333. The agencies you mentioned are not authorized to surveil US persons. Typically only the FBI or cops can do that (and with a warrant.) If they are able to, it's because they got a warrant from a judge who decided it's a national security problem, which means you are probably Bin Laden's homie.

I don‚Äôt know how you guys couldn‚Äôt see this.

This is it, this is your LAST DIP TO BUY FOR TODAY NIOOOOOO DIAMOND HANDS BABY
Dammit Jack, just apologize to Xi and be done with it and get BABA back to 350

We can get it all back, champ.
Ik im retarded but are BABA calls a move? 7:10 call to put ratio rn wtf
Baba drilling to the core of the earth. You hate to see it.
Could you lazy fucks just google it, instead of assuming it's misinformation?

Blood type appears to be a factor. That's not misinformation.

Interesting. For example today where is your stop loss set? I'm very curious how to protect losses as I've been fucked that way before.

This is looking like a dead cat bounce in tech orchestrated by smart money who got caught off guard Monday. Once they exit it could get scary
Lol when you miss out on the NIO wave because you rather play tsla üò¢üò¢
Solo March leaps?!?
BOEING after losing billions of dollars is all of sudden going up. dont worry we going under lockdown soon
Fuck you ZM
When you buy NIO calls at ATH and still make money üôÇ
Who is pouring money into NIO at $54
What are peoples thoughts on AIHS and KXIN?
Buy both, what are you, smooth brain or something? This is a EV flood, everything is going up
To the guy who said AAPL puts were the move, thank you
This aged nicely.
I need to get off this ride, tdoc is sick
R/investing getting in on NIO. Time to gtfo
We will never have a red day again.

Just embrace the euphoria
Did the benchmarks for the new AAPL chips leak?
Everyone here is retarded, but you're something *special*.
Bruh.... I just..... fuck. I can‚Äôt wait until NIO crashes and burns because I can‚Äôt STAND hearing about the stock that I sold 1/15/21 $15 C's for at $14
I am the only one who will exit all positions for this weekend?
Not having daytrades on days like this is like getting a handjob by your cousin on thanksgiving when no ones watching and your dad sees something but you aren‚Äôt sure so you don‚Äôt make eye contact anymore after 10 years. I should call him
ALL IN ON SHITTY WEIRD ELECTRIC CAR COMPANIES

Holy fuck. Nice job brother! Make sure you cash in those tendies.
Since I bought $25 LEAPs at $13--that basically means I got in for 100 shares at $38?
RIP my INTC puts
If I had more capital I‚Äôd totally get xpev calls.. I‚Äôm even considering selling some Nio stocks üòÇ
There were two chances to get in on SOLO, about to miss your last one now
Scared money don‚Äôt make money. Trust your conviction. If you‚Äôre going to pull your dick out then pull it out and commit. Lesson learned
Fuck I‚Äôm going back in on baba
I miss the days when everyone got excited about TSLA like they do these Chinese EVs now
Constantly changing it. Assessing and re-assessing daily
Is there any difference between buy 225 dollars of Bershire A and getting a percentage of a share on robinhood or buying one full share of berkshire b for the same cost?
Ok I‚Äôm done looking for today.
well i sold about 45 NIO contracts yesterday and lost out on about 25-30k
Is this the pump before the market fucking nukes? I'm happy don't get me wrong but... Jesus things are skyrocketing

Fuck the haters who said our PLTR calls were dead last night. We're on a moon mission!
SOLO
KCAC. they‚Äôre public, and merging with QS. It‚Äôs hard to follow all these spacs, but they allow you to get in on the early side if you stay on top of all the spac news
Sold 2 of my NIO calls and bought 2 LI calls,already up by 9%
BOYS SHOULD WE HOLD SOLO???

When people die, what happens to their money?

It gets inherited.  When lots of people die, lots of money gets inherited. That newly inherited money shows up in the market.
Fuck do I sell NIO or do I power through
PLTR moon mission 2020

Bear?
Might lock in some gains on NIO y‚Äôall, fair warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
My dec 18 baba calls are down 30%

This is getting easier. Just find a meme stock and wait for a dip. Buy said dip and take profits when you can.
Target price?
That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm switching to cash account next week. I can‚Äôt miss out on these absolute unit dildos anymore
Wow the SOLO shilling is unreal
Man, NIO is nuts, but it's gunna split a lotta dicks here when its suddenly not. Who the fuck knows when though.
I think so, their cars are ugly and not practical... that‚Äôs going to pop it at some point
I'm NIO breaks 54 again I'm switching to puts. Pray for me.
I wanna see some serious NIO again porn
[removed]
No way
Get in solo now
No one talking about NIU? Another legit EV play. Up huge this week with earnings coming out end of month. Analysts upgrades left and right. Next 100% runner.
Ok I have NIO. Bought at $28. And even I‚Äôm like WTF is going on.
MMs pls stop selling the DAQ I‚Äôm begging you

Well PLTR killed my account later folks glad just blindly throwing money into Chinese EV is the play and when company's miss EPS by a dollar it moons.
Lmao WSB pump and dump? Never heard of SOLO until right now
sitting here with my 5C SOLO leap at 2.30 very comfy
I know every Autist on this sub probably think it would be great News if the chinese government contracts Nio/Xpeng to build military vehicles...but when that happens sell your stock/options. You can bet your ass U.S sanctions will kick in on these Chinese EV makers. Not to mention Xpeng has been caught stealing IP from Apple and Tesla, wouldn't surprise me if they started lobbying the president to do something about their chinese competitors.
Can we all agree that fundamentals mean absolutely fucking nothing at this point? NIO is almost a 30 bagger this year alone in a market that has every right and was given every opportunity to tank over the last year.

NIO 50C 2/21
Shes at least a 7 beer root
I paper handed a few hundred dollar gain, sat for a minute watching it go up, so rerolled back into and enjoying more tendies.
I have no idea I just keep seeing comments so I went to check it out lol
Feels like meme stocks are the only reliable ones these days. The massive rug pull in the future is gonna be epic üòé
This sub really sleepin on SBE
Why are people buying calls on solo cups?
Got 900% return overnight on 54c, sad thing is I only bought 1 for .30, fml

So NKLA joining the EV boom today?

That thing still has 7.5B market cap...unreal

Juggling these NIO  calls like crazy.
bro, there isn't a single company in the nasdaq whose market cap can be justified right now.

the answer is BRRRRRRRRRRRRR and thats all that matters, fundamentals havent mattered in years.
Timing and supply issues. Unclear if they have they supply situation settled now.

That said it just riding the bubble, no real numbers for another year or more.

Regardless, good on ya mate, cheers!

Sold my LI at the dip and rolled over nearly all profits into 1 NIO 68c 12/4 and going to just let it ride for the rest of the month.

Also picked up a FSR 11/20 20c for .65 . Hoping it gets ITM by eod or Monday to sell for 2.50+ . So far good.

Alright I‚Äôm done, sold my fsly calls and fsr calls at open and then scalped 0day fsly after the opening dip back up to 80. I‚Äôm taking the rest of the day off, no sense in losing anything back, I literally just made my account positive for the first time in a year and a half. I‚Äôm so excited üòÜ
Transitioning from NIO to SOLO. The euphoria is real.
yolo'd on SOLO
How is NIO'S market cap justified?
Damn what's going on with Farfetch
Just read 100 comments and 98 are about NIO. Puts on monday
NIO FOMO TRAIN 

FML
Just jumped into SOLO 5 minutes ago, up 10% already. Don't listen to me, I'm autistic
that 15 pltr wall broken, we going to 16 today
It‚Äôs already 15% of my portfolio haha
Damn bro, I lost my c positions and lost on a damn put
No shit I take it back 60 baabyyy
lmao NIOs volume is crazy rn
bought some 0dte on that mini dip
Idk if anyone still plays PCG but that shit is the best hedge to SPY I‚Äôve ever seen
[deleted]
And there goes SOLO, see you at the moon
Bought solo calls at open, up 300% but don‚Äôt have any day trades. Advice?
whyd it jump up
[deleted]
[deleted]
There are many sunrun bulls trying to accumulate share at 50-55 range. It always pops like 5% every only for people who bought at 70 to sell. I think this shit is gonna pop very soon
FUV

Hold
Solo up almost 50%
Lol at the jealous scaremongering üåà üêª
Greed is me looking at a LI call up 700% right now and saying, "No, it can go higher."
NIO...it's one hell of a drug.
It's going to run up until Tuesday at 3
Tesla produces over 400,000 cars a year at it's current stock price. With over $2,000 per share Tesla is valued at just over 400 billion market cap. The main reason why investors like Tesla is due to it's full self driving potential, whether Nio/Xpeng can achieve the same feat is up for debate.
FAANG is all flat to down and yet market is up. Creepy.
Holy shit!

With NIO?
Sometimes you‚Äôve gotta land on the moon before traversing the stars. Cya in interstellar my brother
Did the same with my 11/20 40C before close yesterday. Ugh. But yeah man.
NIO may close over 55 today
Man I swear I always get cucked by apple
Jump on to SOLO now or be forever damned.
If you guys think you can short hundreds of millions of retards FOMOing into Chinese EV, you must hate money
Are you retarded? Use your head abs THINK why they would say this lol.
SOLO about to be one of these stocks ending with 300%?
I do. They're short sellers but iirc their reports do move stocks.
I thought you assholes said SOLO was a shit stock? Missed a 10 bagger smh
Got $800 what‚Äôs my play
BABA 420C June
there's no volume at spy 356 wtf they doin
RIDING SOLO BOYS!
all valid points, I don't disagree with any of it. I'm not necessarily long DKNG, but I own a ton of BETZ shares, just saying its interesting to see them go this route. Of course, other players like CZR & William Hill already have the name recognition and the customer data. All these companies will be fine in the long run
I get what you‚Äôre saying lol but there‚Äôs 300 million people here so 100k+ a day doesn‚Äôt really make a dent
[removed]
Ok I bought nio calls, top is in
[inb4 "I FOMO'd my life savings into NIO at the top"](https://tenor.com/7kAa.gif)

I hate to go against stocks that become a meme but this can't last. Some people are really going to get burned on this one if they're not careful.
i see TSLAQ has moved to NIOQ to stay relevant.

Who are you so wise in the ways of sensible?

Anyone buying long term puts?
They just want you to sell so they can buy more at a lower price
AAPL is toxic, I lost so much money there since the split, forget that shit bro, boomer stock now
You think XEV will catch up to NIO?

Why is TDOC getting humped into the dirt? Wtf lockdowns are good for you retard

We don‚Äôt care because even the dumbest of us have had time to make thousands and thousands of dollars. We‚Äôll stop shilling NIO when NIO stops being NIO
Wait for AAPL to hit sub 117 and then buy back in. This thing has been range locked forever.
KEEP ROLLIN‚Äô ROLLIN‚Äô ROLLIN‚Äô

NIO please stay below $55 today. I have a $55 covered call expiring today and I don't want to lose my shares
Out of NIO calls.  Good luck bros.  I needed to recoup some of my losses from my recent foray into findom
Solo will go crazy this coming month everyone

Kandi, it's like üåà NIO
NIO singlehandedly paying off my student loans.
anyone can think they can improve anything. that's not why he's talked about every day on here tho. it's because there's this impression that he is a demi-god and has a thorough understanding of everything there is to life
Idk man looks like it's stalling out
Does anybody's Investing money not show correctly on RH? I have 34k in it but it only shows 19k since today.
If I get banned from day trading on RH, I can use the longer term stock buy/sell thing as usual, right?
oh fuck it rejected 145
Damn Tesla is dumping
I might have sold my DIS puts to early, but there isnt a world where I dont sell at open today. And im up like $330  already anyway, so im not that torn up about it.
When should someone sell their Nio? Now? Never?
Somebody get Tim üçè on the phone
Netflix and Tesla you‚Äôre going the wrong way!!
doesnt matter, itll reach it

Edit: fuck, -15% in one hour, time to buy more

Nio bears, you guys ok? Dont short this company you will lose lol
So you‚Äôre complaining about leaving one EV trade to early, but planning to do the same thing on your next EV trade?
ZM 500c for next Friday. Theta is insane. Retarded or do you think it will make money?

INTC Jan 2022 50c 

Should have sold during earnings run up. Maybe they'll be enough hope in the air next earnings run up for me to unload my bags
pussy. hands
Assuming stonk go up...what‚Äôs the latest in the day you would sell an expiring call? 3:59pm?
theres no way the government is ok with all these people profiting off of chinese EV's

I mean im in tendie town for sure but how TF are these EV's having greater than +38% weeks back to back? 

WTF is gonna happen tuesday after NIO ER? +50%? 

&#x200B;

ive never been so happy yet terrified in my life
If it holds above 52, then it‚Äôll most certainly make a serious run to 58-61
Nio please. Just wait. Please
PALANTARDS! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of Men comes crashing down! But it is not this day! To the moon!
Citron does this shit all the time ignore them
Annnnd its gone.
Today is the day of reckoning for nio
Just remember to invest the money you're comfortable with. Chinese stocks could go to the moon, but can also fall off a cliff if they lied on their earnings report. Throughout 2019 everyone was thinking Luckin Coffee would be the "Next" starbucks and FOMO kicked in, then the report came out about them lying about their earnings and their stock literally lost 85% overnight. Sure NIO AND XPENG could be the next Tesla of China, but it's almost impossible to know if their earnings are 100% real. I'm just watching from the sidelines and see how far these Chinese EV can go...or Fall. Ford, GM, Toyota must be confused and jealous as hell.
TSLA of all things is holding me back from being green across the board
So I bought a NIO put. It's value went up +10% cause of the volatility. So... that's a win I guess
CANADIAN NIO FOR THE WIN (SOLO)
Apple dumping but spy going up????
I am buying NIO puts based on so many of you guys shilling it.
Man, im playing this game called how long do I hold this huge amount of NIO shares for before it becomes dangerous to hold them
üåà üêª
I will be fucking rich too. If not lets eat rich
Damn SOLO
Why is SOL making waves?
Please don't hit my stop loss NIO keep pumping

Don't forget the new FSR. They going to explode up like Nikola did.  Listed through SPAC, selling EV trucks, may or may not be gravity powered.

The money I made on NIO is still somehow less than the money I lost on AAPL. Amazing.
Solo goin brazyüò≥
Too early an entry or too early exp?
My PLTR calls are up 5% lmao
Literally begging for a nio dip rn
Hey the 1DTE NIO call hack worked. Thanks.
just need to TQQQ to fly by 145
Then get them to sign up for Robinhood and use your referral link. Sell those shares and try again.
RIP Elon
How did you lose money on aapl?  It has been easy money!
SOLO: A WSB STORY
Thats bc she eats a lot of elk meat.
I don't see the benefit in holding TSLA shares anymore. It's boomer certified. $1 trillion market cap impossible
i hate when it becomes so expensive. i‚Äôm new to it but, does it become expensive because it‚Äôs doing well right now? or because a lot of people are buying calls

I‚Äôm just pissed I missed out on NIO, was taking a break from options and this happens! Haha oh well no need to jump into anything and give money away.
macd doesn't agree although RSI does. Personally, I usually trust the former and pay little attention to the latter.
Dont you think the current anti trust regulatory policies and crackdown by chinese govt. wont have any longer term impact?

That's not very bullish of Bullard.
Reports of my PLTR calls demise seem to have been greatly exaggerated.
Sold Li and Nio calls for 3k gains today not bad i guess
Once it breaks resistance at 15 it'll moon to 16 or 17
Pumping on no volume. Volume only @ 4M
This printed
Bruh you don't see a difference between a stupid online matress company, the last retail game boy store, and the Chinese Elon?

Sure wsb loves to pump, and often ends in a dump, but the ticker matters.
Did you make profit? If yes then sell
Keys to success:

1. Create company

2. Put EV somewhere in the description of your company

3. Invite friends and family to work at your company so that Employee count is higher than 1

4. Profit.
Way to early
You got lucky this time.  Still might sell off.  I got 11/20 puts too
Aapl come on man
It has earnings on Tuesday.
Plus expansion in Cali right??
Cant exercise options bought same day on RH.  Lame.
Sometimes?
why wont nio stop
55-60 because big correction IMO
NIO might repeat with NKLA did that day where it shot like crazy at this point who knows.
I'm waiting on a TSLA pump to get out myself. I think one of the gina EV companies is the better option right now
Not comfortable with nio jumping up so much

Sold my 50c leaps for 47% gains

SOLO just made me a 10 bagger
Should‚Äôve sold more PLTR condors that worked out perfectly
Me too.. but im hoping to be out a hot sec inb4 moderna news u know?
Is MRNA going to announce today?
Agreed, whether or not it squeezes, the short thesis of them going bankrupt anytime soon is dead. 

With the console cycle leading their next earnings to insane profits and a competent exec team restructuring the company this is definitely going to net you some tendies regardless of a squeeze. 

As he said there's a lot of manipulation keeping it lower than usual but this will most likely be the bottom for at least the next 5-6 months with the possibility of going to the moon.
And we haven‚Äôt even gotten to thanksgiving or the holidays yet
Is this where you go all in nio

Ah Christ li and xpev I missed it or fomo?
LOL dip to opening price? And people are calling it a dip. it just opened 10 mins ago
I admit that and moving on with puts
MRVL my new best friend
Told y‚Äôall to buy SLV calls üò¨
in $300 into KNDI gonna hold for a week or two. Got out of like 1/4 of my ZM shares at 426 from 390
RIDE and HYLION
PLTR MOOON
Apple a good example of what spy is about to do
0DTE fsly anyone or no balls?
When will zoom reach 500
PLTR bull gang incoming üíØ
ok that was the actual dip, bought it
Could always be worse, I wish the dumb fuck led with I‚Äôm usually wrong. But here I am, lol
no one can tell me this isn‚Äôt a bubble when the biggest movers today are obscure money losing Chinese EV stocks with $70B market caps, a money losing sports betting app, and $200B money losing Chinese Groupon
Why the fuck does DKNG always sell the fuck off at open
Oh man. Got out of AMZN. Done with it. Ended the week up 4700 on it
PLTR was just shakin out those weak hands!
I know your thoughts on Li, XPEV and NIO... What are your thoughts on FSR?
I sold mine for 700% gain bought yesterday and some poor bastard bought them and immediately like 80% probably
Fuck me for selling my NIO calls yesterday. FUCKKKKKK MEEEEEE
> JD

Yeah I sold half because earnings is always a gamble, gonna let the others ride because the EXP is in December
[deleted]
baba u fucking cow, move!!! MOOO!!
very
Sell TUP now or hold?
This is good content
Unlike Chinese EVs they don‚Äôt yet have a product, not until 2022 at least. I‚Äôm getting a bit nervous here. It‚Äôs hitting ATH levels on no news
this game is back on easy mode
its going to blast off and all the bears will go extinct. amen.
Small caps are on a tear today.
You guys should be looking at KNDI. The next NIO, LI, and XPENG, and down from recent highs due to dilution.

3/19 10C
Diversify
sounds fishy....hahah see how i did that
There was your dip, idiots. Hop in.
Bruh what‚Äôs on your watchlist?
The power of meme stock
Bear trap on NIO ü§£
Huge moat. Licensing their intellectual property was their original business
NIHHNNNNNNNNNNNGGGG
Can someone tell me why tf I sold my NIO weeklies yesterday and bought ZM calls?
Sigh. Another rkt bleed out at open.
NIO 0DTE rolled out into 11/27 52c. 

60 EOD boys.
Edited my post.
Yes
That sentiment could be applied to the entire market
fake ass mini dump lol who is gonna believe that NIO isn't gonna shine like LI and XPEV for its earnings next week?
Nio puts for the weekend sell off ü§û
SQ is such a troll stock lol
Edited my post.
This is the way of the morning EV dip
Planning on buying 10 UVXY 1/15/21 $50 calls @.9 Could these be the 10 bagger I‚Äôve always dreamed of ?
HD calls
Got stopped out, only lost $200.  Looks like paper hands are getting busy, though, might try again.
[deleted]
Purchased a $50c on a whim yesterday afternoon. Sold this morning and made more money than I will working all day. Pathetic.
ZM at 420 buy now
[deleted]
People were FOMO'ing hard at 43/share but were skeptical. The day after it rose 12%, and with the LI and XPEV Boom, i think the normies are starting to catch on. NIO isnt mainstream in the normie community yet, only amongst investors IMO.

This is why it can easily boom in the next few months..
That's what I'm leaning toward
Don‚Äôt buy NIO at the top!!
If you missed out on nio dips here‚Äôs another chance
technically yes, because cheaper
what a about SOLO! EV next NIO haha
Nope, edited my post.
Starving Marvin has entered the chat ü§£
I told you retards there would be a nio dip
I‚Äôm up 132% on MGI Calls for 11/20. Cash it in now or let this baby ride?
I was literally placing an order for NIO puts and it dumps... too slow!
Wish I had a girl show this much interest in my shorts
smfh I tried to short NIO at +10% and it just fizzled down to +6% in like 30 seconds
Literally every stock on my watch list is green? Y‚Äôall were talking ab some major crash due to covid last night? Damn y‚Äôall retarded
[deleted]
Lol so tru
I want to jump out of FSR so bad but the thing just keeps rising

Thank go‚Äôs my FVRR calls gains covering my BABA massacre
If Nio hits 48$ u know I‚Äôm buying more lmao
[deleted]
I went to bed up +450 I‚Äôm currently up +1300. I could cry
I guess spy is just going to waggle it‚Äôs dick between 351 and 357 for the next few days...very cool, very fair price. Not like there‚Äôs anything going on to cause markets to make big moves or anything. Nothing to see here. It‚Äôs fine. We‚Äôre good. Total stability and certainty, and incredible conditions for a booming economy
I dont know shit about investing and im still on this sub idk why
MM taking all those NIO 0dte premiums.
Just say you missed out and move on
@tvi feels like it‚Äôs about to break out. Hasn‚Äôt beaten the nasdaq in weeks and all of a sudden it‚Äôs been out performing. Shits about to melt up
Disney stop dropping they were great results
Hmmm,...trying to get more at $53
Drove past a 3 wheel car.........all in SOLO it is.
Is nio ded?
KNDI worth the stock?
BIGC worth buying calls?
ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
PLTR rising from the dead!
yeah bois on it
So we holding Nio Calls?
Im just salty i hopped off NIO at close y'day
Buddy I was motorboating that ass . The pandemic took the night off. I'm not proud of myself but it is what it is at this point.
Didn't even get a chance to average down on PLTR lol
the stock market is a joke lets be real.
9:40 dip right on time!
[deleted]
Amzn <3
Gme 11/20 20c
Nio 55 EOD calling it now
DONT SELL NIO DURING THE 9:40 DUMP THATS WHAT MAKES THE DUMP HAPPEN
Options can be so fucking infuriating. JETS up over 2% and my calls are down today. God damn that's annoying. Same thing with XLF too.
$ICLN $30 today?
You all are ignoring DKNG with the user growth. Why?

These -100% losses are started to make WSB look soft...where are the people selling naked options losing more than they have?

LETS GET THESE NEGATIVE NUMBERS UP BOIS!!!
Nio is crazy.  There is just no way this keeps going.  I can't believe it hit 50. Pewwwwwwwww.  I want to see some gains
Meanwhile, my GME bull put spreads are doing fine.  Gains capped at 50%, but there is solid downside protection built in
[removed]
RH was on some BS at open though
was going to buy some 5c for 11/20 at close and my order didnt fill ü§°
How can anyone look at NIO and say, ‚Äòyeah that‚Äôs perfectly normal‚Äô
Hold
Nice! Thanks man. 

I did however buy cigars. So that‚Äôs me cheating a little. üëÄ
Is this the top?
Good to see NIU finally riding up along with the other Ghyna EV plays.  It has a lot more room to run.
congrats to NIO bulls, but it gonna be red EOD, classic P&D

[deleted]
Lot of sketch pump for it.
Wrong way BABA you worthless POS!
Nothing personal kid
Yesterday I got sick of feeling sorry for myself for selling way too early and I bought back in. Grabbed Feb $60/$65 calls. Already happy I did. Looks like it‚Äôs gonna do it way before February. Be retarded like me and jump in.
[removed]

its insane that the NIO dip was that it ‚Äúonly opened +5%‚Äù
Yeah me too... i just bought some GYNA Ev... I'm sad about it because the only way this can hurt more now is because i caved and i will probably lose money.
So, what is everyone's thoughts on NIO? Dump before earnings or hold?
Im up with nio 20%. Joined on tuesday... thats basically all you have to know to understand whats going on lol
NIO THE UNSTOPPABLE
[removed]
Why do some stocks--even popular ones--have basically zero volume in LEAPs? While others have a bunch?
Honestly mon-wed I was wondering wtf am I doing with my life. But yesterday and today... Damn I know wtf I'm doing man I'm winning some fucking tendies
Can't fight the EV trend man. Loaded up on solo calls and up 80% in 3mins, fucking insane, let's goooooo!
Probs try and find a peak today and sell?
If no moon, it won‚Äôt be as ugly
Same wtf

PLTR just needed a software upgrade, it‚Äôs becoming more self aware
[deleted]

Yes.
Sold the NIO calls I bought yesterday eod for 100%. Will put robinhood down for the day and get some work done. See you boys Monday
Do it pussy
Its gone up way too much. Might wait until next week for a dip
NIO has my portfolio up 50% and I am so excired
If you are using a test with high sensitivity/low accuracy it isn't that unlikely to get a result like this. If he does PCR, there is no way he will get results like this. So, his tweet is bullshit no news, and and guy as smart as him probably knows this and it consequence.
[removed]
I'm up ¬£4000 on shares I bought two weeks ago...
congrats to the dude that was buying 500x NIO 60C @ 0.02 yesterday.  Just rode that lotto with a single call from 0.03 to 0.25.
Blowoff top
I put I limit sell just in case but imma need to update it soon
Buy a nio was enough
SOLO is the next NIO!!! Thanks for the tendies!
Please forgive me if this is a retarded question but why are some of you buying itm 10c LEAPS on PLTR when you expect it to moon to above 50 When you could just buy cheaper 25c?
It's been diagnosed with Helter Skelter syndrome, be nice
QuantumScape isn't even public yet. Do you mean you're just long as in planning to buy when they list, and overall very confident in their company and technology? Thank.
fomo‚Äôd into NIO with 0dte 50c and already up 40% holy shit
NIO was the first WSB play I've gotten in on in a while. Was quite late getting onboard and it was still quite profitable.
# is loading BABA leaps retarded at this price level ?
I‚Äôm so tired of not buying NIO
Nio skyrockets to 52 with absolutely no signs of stopping, there really is no stopping this train. I'm 100% FUCKED for the next month on cash thanks to this. Welp, I guess this is it. Don't have anything to invest on this huge leap, may as well watch and dream how much more I could of made off of Nio. Lesson to be learned retarded fuckos? 
Stonks only go up...
When do we get nio puts guys? Wait a little longer?
Sold nio at open ‚òπÔ∏è
No nio dip. Wtf

Priced in now with LI
Pretty much my entire portfolio has been going down, except nio... which means my portfolio is going up.
Well it was fun trading with you guys, lost all my savings and idk what to tell the gf. Maybe I‚Äôll be back if I can save up more!
Robinhood about to fuck us
AMD told me ‚Äúfuck your calls expiring today‚Äù
Bull trap on spy
My corn calls just told me they're worth 2.25 all of the suddsn
Ok show me
Smart. You won't make bank thanks to the mouse's retard strength, but dis should drop with lockdown announcements
Please tell me it‚Äôs coming back üò´

WTF ROBINHOOD
Covid is just a flu, fight me maggot

Thank you RH options aren‚Äôt updating
Wtf is up with Robinhood!!?? It‚Äôs not updating my option gains
Just said we can‚Äôt ignore it in a good way
There should be a separate daily thread just for NIO
LETS GO NIO!!
BABA you piece of shit
Just gotta put $12 on Joe Exotic's books and he gonna make that call for you son.

Bid/ask not showing up for my NIO 50C sweet
You buy the Elon COVID did easy
on track to make over $1 million in profit for my company for the year and what do they say? "hey kid, here's $50 gift card for amazon. get yourself something nice"

fuck i can't wait to work for myself
PALANTARDS! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of Men comes crashing down! But it is not this day! To the moon!
[deleted]
Are you up or down for the week? 

I'm down bigly. Hugely.
NIOOO
Wtf with the almost +1% open! 

Bear market retardness
lol pussy
NIO calls not updating?
Got tired of being the idiot who sold NIO way too early so yesterday I bought Feb $65 calls. At this rate it‚Äôs gonna happen in 2 weeks
[removed]
Mine arnt either rn
Ok. Ya know, I don't think I understand how it works really. Reading a lot def helps I'm sure. Some TA I guess but gotta be more. Options data? What little you've said is plausible and that read for yesterday definitely was impressive, especially in light of those mid day news.

And I can dig the cockiness
Good lord, NIO is unstoppable
NIO!!!!
Let‚Äôs go DKNG
Confused on how my $50C NIO is down ü§®
PLTR Gonna moon it looks like
Or did he wait to announce vaccine right when he knew he would be selling stock. I would call that insider trading.
Patience
They look like missing a chromosome.
Watching my NIO calls is just like playing that stupid Roobet game, trying to time when to get out.
iv
Anyone else have a lag on RH for their NIO and Palantir option updates in the morning?
Yesterday
Thanks PLTR for not fucking dying
Sold 40k of EV stock yesterday. I is sad
Thats the plan. I'll hold til tuesday market open.
Welcome to todays moon mission powered by Xi
Love the awkward smiley white guy getting thumbed.. Wait is he a Biden?
Why the fuck are my options not changing prices uhhhh
Pltr off to the races
Doesn't matter. He can probably get better medical care than the president.
Holy crap
I'ma just hold, looks like its not going to dump at open if its still being bought up like this. I'll sell probably Tuesday morning tbh before NIO's earnings.
[removed]
We are only accepting jelqers at this time. Thank you for your application.
If ur seriously asking, IV is implied volatility. Basicaly how risky the option is. Before earnings and for growth stocks, IV is usually high, right after earnings and with expiry date just a few days away, IV usually drops A LOT, which means people don't think much will change the stock. This means options value drops because people can guess now what the stocks gonna approximately be at.
Would you rather have $1 or $100?  If you said $100 then options are for you!
Here we go boys
Wonder if any analyst downgrades DIS they get a visit from Mickey and his gang.
I‚Äôm looking at this one called NIO. Seems to be doing alright. They make cars. Thoughts?
Other than Monday this week was boring af for spy. Stayed in the exact same range.
NIO is gonna break the Matrix if it keeps pulling this shit
Papa gonna cream

But That‚Äôs kind of the best Part of it it could appeal to other people with different interests. not everybody likes electronic vehicles like certain people in my family want nothing to do with electronic vehicles because they travel long distances and they dont like the idea of have to charge up n be waiting for a battery to fill up. They enjoy driving long distance to all types of destinations- vacations etc. that‚Äôs just what they enjoy doing (different strokes for different folks). when I even mention EV they quickly denounced the idea of it whereas a hybrid vehicle maybe they would be more open minded to it. I‚Äôm in all three actually well four if you count tesla too. Just food for thought üí≠ ya know but point taken into consideration ü§ôüèº
Holy crap I just looked up what the SOLO cars look like. It looks what Peter Gregory drove off in on Silicon Valley haha
Best of luck men
Looks at my nio history.

Acb is up quick everyone invest

Uhh sir....
Buy the dip for BABA
NFLX 500c 11/20
I‚Äôm waiting to buy in @ 69.42
Oh yes, this is my approach as well. It's why I'm bullish on GE these days.
FSR calls at open. Fisker about to explode like NIO LI XPEV
should‚Äôve put this one on r/investing man
Yes, but so was that Tesla action lol
Not if you get the right away and sell at 11am.  That‚Äôs the NIO trend.  Low at open and high as fuck at 11am.
good luck yall, bout to be a hell of an interesting day
Nio will buy me a yacht one day
Probably not optionable day one.
have they had earnings yet or not?
You‚Äôre too early, there will be a blow off top before the decline
When looking at the options chain, click "select" in the top right corner.
is NIO gonna break through the 100RSI line?

is that even possible?

Last I checked it was only 20% short interest, I think there's enough liquidity to sustain that for now but could change. I'd love to see it hit 30 but I think there's a lot of people who will have exit points before then keeping it grounded.
Have been on a nice streak listening to random replies for plays on the daily this week. Anyone have any solid plays for the day? Thanks!
Never doubt the power of becky to keep DIS and PTON  LULU afloat

XPEV
Throw it all into nio calls you‚Äôll have 10k by Tuesday sell before earnings
NIO *and* TSLA

I was confused and bought INO I don't know if it's better or worse so I'll just buy more
Haven‚Äôt been this excited for a market open in a long time. Let‚Äôs goooo
Solo cars are as autistic as hyperloop by virgin - yankees are thinking of solution for a problem that existed and has been compromised, the answer is the public fucking transport like trains, trams or buses like in the rest of the fucking world. I swear, even in my eastern shithole we got trains that are moving easily with 100mph+ speed and a whole lot of connections within the inner city and suburbs, why would you reinvent the wheel. I guess if you were asked about how do you want to transport between cities in future but in 1700 you would beg for faster horses and not entirely new category of machines
DIS puts here. No brainer

My morning trading routine involves playing American idiot since I have no idea what I‚Äôm really doing but the green lines that go up sure are pretty.
I bought 100 shares of that at around $2. Sold it at $5 4 months ago.

Going to buy 25 contract nov 20th. $16 call

Do you think I can get disability if my options trades are clinically retarded? Free monthly yolo tendies.
It‚Äôs Friday the 13th. Be careful of them black cats bouncing.
His definitive blood test result will only be made available after hours. The question is, are people gonna hold over the weekend to find out?
I live in Vancouver, do not fucking buy SOLO expecting guaranteed long term gains a la NIO. this shit is a pump and dump, it was at $15 at IPO before turning into a penny stock and nobody is buying it
This was the way 9 out of 10 days
This is a cheat code. Thanks

What's your problem man? You go around insulting people on reddit nonstop?

You seem like you're a grown ass man with experience and had some success in trading. Don't be a piece of shit. Instead offer advices in a non-threatening way so other people can learn and make money. Don't be that guy man. With age and experience comes wisdom. Grow the fuck up
I bought a bullshit put FD lotto ticket for end of NOV just in case it drops of the next few days but I'd gladly burn it to see this happen. Post that shit when you do it.

I CANNOT WAIT
Is anyone buying NIO calls today and holding over the weekend? FOMO is real but I fear it could drop on Monday. Then again, I‚Äôve made the mistake of doubting NIO before...

Oddly specific
The fact that you think that‚Äôs a big deal is comical. This is another irrational exuberance stock. It could go to $100. Who knows where it will go in the short term. I can tell you one thing, when people get off of this it‚Äôs gonna get nasty quick. That‚Äôs they way fad stocks are. Good luck to all but this is about as overvalued as I‚Äôve ever seen a stock.

Bought NIO shares a few months ago, and 50c 1/21 weeks ago, expecting to hold for at least a month or two and maybe sell it around 60 if I was lucky.  But now it's a WSB meme stock, and at this rate, it will reach 1000* by then!  Thanks, WSB

*And by reach 1000, I mean blow up and end up <50

It is a shitty electric go kart! However the application of the tiny kart to say European cities, who‚Äôre trying to cut congestion and CO2 at a lowish initial cost, could really make this a EV that‚Äôd pick up in time.

However, I really hope they re-design the thing, it looks like shit.

Got out of NIO at 48 for some 1.5-2 bagger. Should I wait for the morning dip to get back in or is today the sale off day?
If you don‚Äôt buy NIO you don‚Äôt care about the environment and turn a blind eye to Chinas pollution problem. And that makes you a bad person
I wish there was NIO when I was in school
And I usually have 100+ tabs open. But I see what you're trying to say. I suck at reading fast
I'm gonna Will PLTR to over 16 today.

New gambling markets are gonna be opening up in all of the states that don‚Äôt currently have legal gambling. Being first in marketing is more important than revenue at the moment.

The thing I don't like about LI is that they're a hybrid vehicle rather than a straight up EV. Hence my money is on NIO and XPEV over LI. But LI looks to be taking off all the same so what do I know...

Still gotta decide if they're right/trustworthy. I see a lot of contradictory stuff posted. I assume you're not gonna share what it was that tipped you off. And I don't see that you called the move publicly.

And those strings of numbers give you a lot of wiggle room after the fact. Am I wrong? And note that I wouldn't hold unexpected news fucking everything up against you.

I'm not really sure how having 4x the sales but losing twice as much money is considered killing it; I think that is more of a failure.

Definitely sounds like you need to do some research. They‚Äôre warrants are like a 5 year option to buy for 20$ (it may be more than $20)

So how does that work nowadays? They wear mask?
Their earnings are temporarily depressed because of covid-19 which is distorting the ratio. No reason why they won‚Äôt quickly go back to their old earnings they had pre-covid once pandemic is over, now that vaccine is being released shortly. And with the roaring success of Disney plus, the valuation should be now higher than it was pre-covid (netflix has a P/E ratio of 140 but I don‚Äôt hear you complain about that).
Don‚Äôt tell mango supporters that. In their alternate reality covid isn‚Äôt real, and every vote not for mango is voter fraud

i thought nio was the golden egg but it just seems to be an EV stock, after seeing LI and XPEV.

NIO makes Tesla look like a penny stock from a valuation perspective.
ah its all good man, profit is profit. Gains are Gains. I think that we gotta be cognizant of that fact. Being greedy or chasing stuff is what makes people lose it all.

If a damn Door Dash driver knows about NIO, that shit is overvalued and due to drop significantly!

I know bro she gives me the same type of support, she's an amazing woman.
Market looks like it wants to take a dump at open.
Whenever I go outside at night, the city is crawling with people delivering food. They're the only ones out and they are everywhere. It has a kind of post-apocalyptic vibe to it. Boggles my mind that people are spending this much money during a time where supposedly no one has jobs.

Trading with the trend works for everything, the trick is seeing when it's going to reverse, or when it goes into a trading range.  Also, look at various time frames to confirm what you think you're seeing.

I could recommend some materials to check out, but there are cases to be made against everything, so it would just be attacked / shot down.  Instead I'll suggest for you to look into "price action".
FSR about to be explode like XPEV / NIO / LI

After the war, they invested a cunt-load of money into Japan's infrastructure to foster the modern economy that it has today. 

Same thing with SK. Both were for geopolitical reasons yes but the point I'm making is that it was an expansion of culture and ideas that lead to learning and innovation - and (at least after 45) no one was trying to murder each other.

Even Leopold wasn't that bad. At least Congolese people still exist in reasonable numbers - and have statehood.

And btw America didn't learn shit from the Native Americans. Look at they did in the Philippines, Cuba, Nicaragua, Hawaii, etc.

Save for a couple of exceptions with America it's not the carrot or the stick, it's the stick or the boomstick.
That sounds like Financial Mumbo Jumbo. To the moon we go!
to celebrate NIO, consider PandaExpress as a dining option for your date
Well it‚Äôs PM but yea
Next meme stock
Basically the company will sell a large amount of shares to the public which lowers the price due to increased volume.  It's a tool that a publicly traded company may use in situations where their stock increases unexpectedly like this to generate operating capital.
Chinese EV bears lmaooooooo
Ok. But without knowing for sure, the first half of the day looked like we were bouncing off resistance upward. And wouldn't overnight be the time to go through the support? Lure everyone into thinking we're holding and then bam
I won't, friday selloff incoming
Ride that shit to expiry
this is the way

How exactly do you "escape taxes" on a gain like this? I don't think it's possible, unless you're talking about some convoluted scheme to immediately buy real estate or some sham business, and claim a huge amount of paper losses or deductions. 

Then you've got a headache about managing THAT whole charade. So you create yet another charade when the tax bill for your first charade comes due. 

30 years later, you're $1 billion in debt to the Russians, you're President of the United States, and the New York Times is clamoring to publish your tax returns. Is that what you really want?

Btw major congrats OP.

If you already have iphone/ipad, its a no brainer. The ecosystem integrates seamlessly between all your apple devices. I can start texting via iMessage app from my iPhone and continue it on my iPad and MacBook and the iMessages update simultaneously on all devices. Same with document access/editing. I pay $2.99 for 200GB iCloud storage that can be shared across all your devices and your family members. You save the document on one device, it‚Äôs available on another device seamlessly.

But the best thing is the M1 chip. Ridiculous battery life, and ridiculous performance. They clocked better performance on m1 MacBook Air than all of 2019 MacBook Pro lineup with Intel chips.

He won‚Äôt bend the knee because when you‚Äôre gonna be a billionaire anyway your ideals are more important to you. But he doesn‚Äôt need to. CCP can only justify a relatively mild scenario. What happened was that everyone‚Äôs fear that already resulted in BABA being severely undervalued materialized. Once it‚Äôs out that scenario will be mild BABA will rocket way past its previous highs. Even at a medium scenario it will. All it needs is for it to become clear that CCP doesn‚Äôt plan to completely fuck them over, which they don‚Äôt. Because even the leftists know money is king.

We sailed our fucking navy over there and said ‚Äúhowdy‚Äù then they bombed us and we nuked them. Twice. 

South Korea? We sent our army there to protect them from communism and then laid down 1,000,000 anti personnel mines in the 48th parallel just to make sure communism couldn‚Äôt sneak across. 

We colonized them without them knowing it. Through superior military force. Then we set up favorable trade deals for ourselves. 

Look I‚Äôm not arguing with you. Europeans did a horrible job with colonization. America did it pretty right save for our treatment of native Americans. We learned pretty quick through this that the carrot is often better than the stick.
Like a few scary articles will crash the market lmfao

Fuck them!

Shorting them will be free money, after IPO pop ... if it even pops!
I'm actually hoping for a drop so I can pick more up. This is nuts.

I'm hoping they all dump.....nio,li,xpeng.

When's the IPO date?
.5 million sell orders sitting at $51, looks like you're gonna get your dip.
you think it ever will? will these lockdowns help?
It‚Äôs up 5% I‚Äôm not *really* stressing yet lol

Noooo, nio is supported by the Chinese government rn, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going up. Also the new president elect is into oil alternatives. Are you trying to tell me the stock market is that predictable...

I‚Äôve ordered it 5x this week! Never did before and love it!
I don‚Äôt think anyone would buy mine anyways
The thing about it is it helps map it out, but can be so inaccurate it‚Äôs like why bother. Here‚Äôs my point I watched a guy draw this tight wedge on spy. He said that‚Äôs it it‚Äôs either breaking out up or down but judging by equity flows and volume it‚Äôs breaking down. Okay made sense and then spy broke the wedge and headed down. Guy loaded up on puts, but then spy shot back up into its wedge and broke out to the upside the next day. So he completely changed his chart pattern because it all got thrown out.

Happy fucking Friday. Finally. This week felt so long. One good thing that happened this week is I started watching Queen‚Äôs Gambit in Netflix. It‚Äôs quite legit.

DoorDash can suck my donkey dick!

They have the worst hidden fees of any company I have ever seen ... including financial instruments!

I will be shorting those bitches as soon as the initial IPO pop is over!
Let me rephrase. The TAM may be that big but a lot of Commercial Customers want a scalable solution not one that is custom built.  Those are expensive and hard to support long term.  Big reason why SAP is floundering and competitors likes Salesforce and Adobe are doing so well.

Recommend not selling your calls today (especially tech) and holding through weekend.
Ain‚Äôt no gay bear here but I‚Äôm praying for a NIO dip or IV crush. I‚Äôm tryna grab more leaps. Same with PLTR.
No.
I‚Äôm not gonna do this obviously but I want to throw my whole 16k account into NIO calls at open
Get out while you're up!! Puts on NIO today. Sorry kiddos.
Get much longer dated puts. Dont try and time the market, you'll never make it that way.
I don't lose equity until next friday baby  GB4L
Y nio go down when it be up
My 11/13 46p would *love* that lmao
I wish people would just the FULL articles and not solely go by the title. They list the companies and NIO, Xpeng and Li aren't on it.

Tinder dating tip #69:

Do not date single moms, unless your portfolio is adept at a quick pump and dump scheme.

Tinder dating tip #420:

Thots who say "Not sure what im lookin for üòõü§§" lack market guidance and have high volatility; trade with caution and sell naked calls if able.

Tinder dating tip #69420:

Go for profiles that say "Looking for a third wheel". It never hurts to befriend someone with a large enough capital to roll three wheel strategies, and you get to fuck his girlfriend in front of him.

Usually the high made in pre is usually the high that is tested for the day, so if retail can get it above it should keep grinding up.
I was not retarded when I was younger and am not now. Good that you aren't totally tragic.

they are doing lovely
If DKNG hits 60 I'm not going to work anymore
You‚Äôre wrong if your losing equity on being early or late.
I sold half yesterday for 300%....
Nah - it‚Äôll be back there by 11am ET.
Lol this has happened to all EVs all week lol. You WANT this. The opening bell pop will be that much greater.
Did someone say tsla puts?
Or shake people out 

I‚Äôd tread *really* carefully with NIO today
Same!!
Sell at open lol
It's called the rapid test being not accurate with half false negatives.

False negatives way more frequent than false positive.

Elon has Covid.  Buy NIO.
EV sell off today
Will next Tuesday be Battery Day 2.0?
Ya fair enough. I was aware of that. But would you really trade on that on a day like yesterday? So stonks go up, usually over night. But all they *this* night is the question, no?
You can't have colonialism without mass murder. When people are complaining about the crimes of colonialism genocide and slavery is exactly what they're talking about.

So when people say that colonialism was a good thing, to people whose peoples were colonised it sounds the exact same as defending the actions of Nazi Germany. That's part of why people call people Nazis so much today even if they aren't wearing swastikas.  


>What I am saying is the natural progression is to expand ones culture and ideas and this has lead to learning and innovation.

You don't need colonialism to do this. Look, for example, what America did with countries like Japan and South Korea. 

Colonialism is invasion, occupation, and resource mining. It isn't a benevolent expansion of culture and ideas the way you claim.

[This](https://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2018/03/29_EYFN6J.jpg) is what colonialism looks like.

Jumped on the new M1 MacBook last night. Originally, I ignored it thinking Apple refreshed another laptop without real changes. But that M1 chip is a game changer.

I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if your serious or sarcastic.

Pretty minimal for something that ran 100%+ this month
Haha this applies to a lot of tardos in here
Hopefully it‚Äôs not the Challenger lol
What stock are you gonna buy with the money from your 18th birthday?
I appreciate boomers on here thinking people are just too young to know how the world really works instead of owning that "we lazy and f'd it up and never tried to fix anything."
Everyone has ‚Äúhot hands‚Äù with NIO. I think it‚Äôs a good risk reward. Even if you lose money, the stock is asking for a dump at this point
THIS. There won't be another covid crash but we could easily see a dib to 300-320 if there are a wave of bankruptcies and another lockdown

No
Toot that mothafucking thang up
They have 25M units of the vaccine. Not nearly enough for anybody

I feel like if anything NIO dropping a little from its premarket highs is just going to make jumping in that much more tantalizing
lmao enjoy losing all your money
Holy fucking shit Door Dash, my favorite lazy fat fuck service is going public? Guys. This is huge. Gonna be one of the hottest IPOs of the next decade.
I bought a shit load of 1dte $39s that I own for $.03 if it gets wiped that's the way she goea
The Baba recovery will launch today. It‚Äôs your last chance to jump in. You‚Äôve been warned.
I can't really speak for the east I-70 corridor but overall I think very safe compared to the rest of the country. 6 years ago we moved from a rural community an hour outside Wichita to a close suburb. I miss the size of the yard and lack of traffic and noise but literally have had not a single incidence not have we heard of any close by. We see some stuff about unlock cars getting gotten into in the paper but nothing major. Contrast that with my son being in the San Antonio area for the last year for work - it's a constant battle for him. His truck has been broken into 4 times. He's always sending me video of junkies all over town. Other stuff as well. I couldn't do it.
RIP Huey
Chinese EV giving you one last chance to load up at open smooth brains. Don't fuck this up for the 50th time
PLTR mooning today at open.
Imagine how rich the GME bulls would be if they invested in NIO instead of a dying retail company.

Moderna vaccine is RNA-based, so requires special -72¬∞C fridges which makes them impossible to mass-distribute = not a game changer no matter what efficacy %.
Yeah its just chinese ev hype
NIO PUTS ?
 Synlogic, i think
Its like.... They don't even know nio exists
So after being unprofitable for years at the end of the console cycle, suddenly being MASSIVELY profitable in q4 earnings (march) won't have any affect on stock price?  This is going to be head and shoulders above tech earnings during last earnings season.  The only question is whether the q3 call coming up talks about it enough to send it into the 20s or 30s on its own
I‚Äôm selling puts today, gonna steal money from the NIO bears thinking ER is bad üò≥

Oh shit, all the Chinese EVs fading hard. NIO flash crash to $29 at open?
Well I see you're confident lol. I see a bunch of numbers for SPX from yesterday morning, one of which was almost exactly closing price. Impressive. I take it that first pair is a high/low range for the day. The rest is Greek to me atm. I see nothing about today so far though.
A company like Ford sells far more cars in one to two down weeks than Nio has sold ever
POP LOCK AND DROP IT
lmao
Holy shit you are both special. He said sell in January. And he is right, we with multiple llcs and complex accounts file in October. 

Lastly al you are avoiding is state income tax....get over it. 6% give or take.

This is worse than cramer buying
When it reaches your friends you know it‚Äôs a thing - who didn‚Äôt see draft kings exciting Wall Street? In this last quarter alone I saw just a few people I know start to gamble on sports to almost everyone I know gambling by last week. Now I‚Äôm in several group chats with different friends talking about sports betting. It‚Äôs mainstream. Legislation is looking good for legalization in more states.
Do people who do math even understand what they doing or do they just make up numbers?
Just for clarification, are you getting the phrase ‚ÄúNio ends 60 EOD‚Äù on you? Or Just Nio? Or a picture of their car?
You clearly belong in this sub retard. Welcome
BABA fair value should be 425-450. Once Ma apologizes and Ant IPO happens its only up from there
u mad u didn't invest big boi?
Im in the same boat bro nothing but pain
He didn‚Äôt say anything, anywhere, about the US.  You know Facebook exists outside of the US, right? ü§î

I bought the dip yesterday.  Hoping for a big rebound.  Debating whether to hold any beyond today.
You're probably better off :)
All of them.
Let‚Äôs hope it won‚Äôt fade
They printed yesterday lolololoolloo how much you down from Monday though my dude. 300p 11/9 ü§° I‚Äôll stop messing with you since I know you‚Äôre having a rough week. Btw I‚Äôm up 234% this week and about to cash out for more gains. Good day sir
LO
That's a good analogy.
This looks like it‚Äôs setting up to either rocker to the moon or drill to the earths core
I‚Äôd sell and wait. It spiked pretty hard so IV is going to be soaring.
Baxkflip
OKKKKKAYYY.  OOOOUUUTTTT.
Not to brag or anything but last week I shorted NIO and stole $300 from a WSB kid
You clearly haven‚Äôt watched PM all week lol
And AMZN
Same my man. Feelsbad
Every second of my fucking life
That would be such a smart move on their part though. If I remember correctly when Tesla did that it was a short lived dip
Unfortunately those are worthless.
i both laughed and cried a little at this...maybe simultaneously
Just trying to grab those pennies.  The longer the morning wears on, the better I feel.  Hitting 60 today would be unbelievable, but I think it would be the largest single day NIO has had in the last 3 months(if not 6 months).
My spy puts are fucked. Also this stress is affecting my vision. Parts of my field of view are blurry.
[deleted]
Unless it goes down in which case, amazing foresight
he‚Äôs basically saying the available testing is garbage, because 50% n=4 is a horrible false positive rate or false negative rate for any ‚Äúreliable‚Äù test
It‚Äôs barely holding 51 right now... it‚Äôs going to sell off at open. People *are* going to take profit.

I‚Äôll fomo in if it dips to 46-47 today
What, it is a true. Look on there website and do DD lol, Xpeng is the real deal
not cool
FSLY ‚úîÔ∏è

They see trends and think it matters. NIO had a triple top, a sign we are gonna dump. What happened? We fucking mooned lol
Doordash Im coming for ya baby
I believe that already happened.. I sold GME a few weeks ago for 200% and AMC yesterday for 200%. still have a couple cheap lottos, but I'm not sure either of those two are going anywhere.

Why TF would you buy leaps on ZM with a vaccine on the horizon?

This is why this sub loses money.
You'll have time to buy when it drops into the 30's at some point
Confirmed it is not you
Youd probably never see him
Pussy
Hi guys , I'm new here. have you heard of NIO
Except I was a brainwashed retard when I was younger too. Then I grew a few brain cells and learned to differentiate fact from fiction. Good luck with your brain
Ok, so if that were the case, the short interest should be below 15% correct?  It shouldn't be over 100%.  You seem like the type of person that just yolos into shit they read about on wsb and doesn't even know what the given ticker company does
Now I just need ZM to move its ass
lmao I'll bet you love rick and morty
Nope
Nio idiot put holder like myself I expect a big dip at open that might be our only chance to get out!

But I‚Äôm an idiot for buying them in the first place so what do I know
Take some profits my guy
Mesk*
report back
Death Trap.
Only if they announce change of CEO or move to 10, 7, or 5nm
Damn LI go back up
I recalled some1 on this forum has January call on pltr and was up like 1200, wonder how is he doing
Is this a troll account?
I think puts print from earnings drop. Gonna buy some td or monday
Why not buy Puts to bide the time?
Lmao solid point
Someone please tell me I'm not the only one who missed out on NIO
Thatta boy
She calls all day Last I heard.
Post picture of butt or ban
That's cause they're already at $50 pre market
SPXS is 3x inverse of the market. In order to move 3x the market they have decay and lose money when the market remains flat. You can look at there chart to see what I mean.
NIO isnt sold in the US dumbass
Will LI pop at open or continue to dump????
You all own LI, but what about LU? 

Chinese fintech that recently IPOd, 40B+ market cap, opened IPO at $11.60 and closed at $17.85 yesterday...

Man, China stocks going ham
moderna vaccine news soon too, ill be in on AMC

Idk. Hope that helps
Elon maybe has covid??
Yeah they are all fading hard
Just diluted shares didn‚Äôt they?

DKNG, you're making daddy so proud. Keep it up and you can come home for Thanksgiving.
Serious question. Is NIO going to ever be red again lol? Remember looking at it when it was $1.40 a share. üòû
Got a Walmart ps5 ordered yesterday, going to press my luck by shorting nio from open to 10am.
The comment I came on her face for.
I‚Äôm dating NIOs hot American sister, FSR and yes I‚Äôm glad for it
Esports retard
I like ZM the in-day swings on it are really extreme. But any meme stock that had more than a couple of posts here on wsb will do the trick
maybe I can actually get out of FSLY today
She must be like 12 with all the extra letters she puts in words so I‚Äôm out.

Do you happen to know information on the expiries?
NIO or LI  have no owners clubs pages on FB,no pics of cars on the streets. Tesla has hundreds, go figure. NIO cars is NO cars. Puts on both.
don't worry donnie, your lawyer will argue this all the way to the supreme courtyard of marriott
Not market, just Nio.
Imagine the shit storm in here if NIO announced a stock offering during their ER call next week   XD
It's a 2020 Reliant Robin
what are our thoughts on sq? feeling like a pop kinda day. pop up or down im not sure. hoping up
My sarcasm was intended with the addition of the question mark prior to the exclamation... bad joke I guess
Don't know man.
That‚Äôs what they do here. GameStop, nio, whatever. They latch onto some idea like ‚Äúomg once in a lifetime short squeeze!‚Äù Sometimes they get lucky, sometimes they don‚Äôt.

Many theaters have been effectively closed anyway because there are no new movies to show and the operational expenses to keep the lights on/doors open are too high.

Everyone bitching about NIO is praying for a 9:30 entry sub 52. üòÇ
Completely new to this. I bought NIO $42 12/18, $45 12/24, and $46 1/15 options on 11/1 when the stock was around $32. How bad will theta decay fuck me around earnings?
A kid I work with told me he heard from a reliable source NIO would be over $200 by the end of next year. I laughed him off he went balls deep in calls a few months ago, I did not. Who is laughing now? It is not me ü§°
Nice another company that loses money and has no plans to make a profit
just how i like them
No, but when you've already discounted COVID entirely when being at all time high as we are, don't expect to have no effect if things reverse.
Sell some covered calls
üòÇ
Going through your post history I feel like you claim you get scammed a lot, when in reality you just make shit plays.

Wow. Should not have sold my NIO calls at close.

DIS is already trying to do it. FSLY more of a niche CDN anyway, if company can still leverage scale of Akamai (the commodity side) and build the smarter stuff in house it makes sense.

I somewhat agree with you.  My play was more of an IV play that was supposed to wrap up yesterday, but as things developed it was good to just diamond hand things and let things develop today. 

Covered calls against LEAPS are an interesting strategy, but I'd be reluctant to do that against these EV meme stocks.  For all the people that got minted millionaires this summer over the TSLA shenanigans, I've got to believe a lot of people took it straight up the ass.
There will definitely be some profit taking this morning . I‚Äôll wait until it settles a little bit

Upvote if you're adding calls to nio XPEV and li today
NIO up 25x since March. What a scam
Cash rules everything around me CREAM
Sure, looks like a stable investment that can only go up
Should've rolled all my cash in nio into LI for the day for that sweet pump.  Can't believe I'm not happy enough with a likely 15% sympathy spike that nio will undergo today.  These EV companies are really fucking with my perception of a good daily return rate.

i'm retarded. what's the highest strike price for covered calls in nio you can sell? wellsfargo is showing me the highest strike for 11/20 is $48 in the options chain.

On robinhood, if i had shares there, it looks like i can sell $65 11/20 covered calls no problem.

ü§°
Be sure you're watching RSI.  This stock is so transparent when it reverses back to bullish on the 1-minute chart.
I‚Äôm still anticipating a sell off at open
Been saying this, people don‚Äôt understand what caused the March crash. Zero knowledge about the virus, indefinite length for economic shutdown, liquidity crisis, oil price war. 

None of those are the case now.
Tsla peaked at 10,000%. Nio is currently at 631% not including pre market. 2000% is if you start at the bottom instead of the beginning. If you use $3 for Tesla bottom then we get an insane percentage for returns.
But dude, he could get two for the price of one!

how far OTM are you willing to go???

It's currently at around $5. I think that people are hoping that it catches on and takes off like NIO, XPEV, etc. However, if you actually zoom to >1 year, you'll see that it has certainly reached $5 before and has not maintained a very high stock price at all.
Yeah, it has been doing that everyday and then pops

Buying puts would be the logical thing to do but when so many of you are being misled a rational strategy can easily backfire. I am not going near these stocks for now. I did want Chinese investors to invest in American stocks post Biden and not American investors investing in Chinese stocks - but that's mainly because I like inventors and original creators to benefit more over copycats, not because I own those stocks. These guys have less accountability and transparency than NKLA.

I mean if a new high keeps being made, I wouldn‚Äôt short it until it really struggles getting and holding a certain point. Up is infinity, down is only to $0 and in stocks that is extremely rare for that to happen.
Seems like a good idea to short these EV stocks but I am scared. WSB is a pretty effective ponzi scheme. Look at NKLA it's still floating. NIO has been sued for misleading American investors before by the way. They lied about building factories and what not.

for 40-49 year olds it's between 0.08 - 0.4 % fatality

for 50-59 year olds it's between 0.5 - 1.3 % fatality

depends on the country, I hope he is not in Italy at the moment

that statistic is fatality per total confirmed cases. they stress multiple times that the total number of cases is higher because not every case is tested.

Touch her butt while she bangs her boyfriend you cuck
Well with Chinese EVs it has been trickier, as WSB has been going on about NIO for months now and so far they have been consistently right. I also thought that with Tesla bubble bursting, Chinese EVs were also going to fade back to normal, but here we are. But i do agree, that even something as simple as looking at charts, last weeks gains, at least in a short term, it will pull back in the coming days. I can not imagine institutions holding their big positions much longer after such amazing returns. That, or new shares offering my companies must be just around the corner.
44 0dte lol
Hey guys I‚Äôve been watching the stocks all night the EVs are definitely dumping today get out at open I got out before close last night in anticipation. NIO GANG we will persist but let‚Äôs get back in next week on the dip homies
I saw a list and none of these tickers were on it wish i kept tge link
Alright homo, call down.

Why you so mad, is it because ur dear leader lost ?
Put $100 into a call now or something. That way if it tanks you'll be at peace but if it goes up you'll be at more peace since you'd be part of the action albeit a little.
Am I too late to step into NIO?

NIO getting too much WSB tbh probably gonna tank next week on earnings.
I only have like 200 usd to begin with...
Bomb ass DD. I‚Äôm in.
Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt ready for the market drop at 9:30 ü§£
Flash crash to $29 at open
Please buy puts and post results
No dividend anytime soon.... I'll buy back in the 110s
He‚Äôs questioning COVID results right before another potential lockdown?  ü§£ü§£ü§£ Dude is transparent. ü§£ü§£ü§£
claiming that a startup Chinese EV company will grow 100x after growing 2300% is just unrealistic and you calling me dumb for commenting on "the way I feel" is even dumber because the numbers are just too unrealistic for it to happen
Do you think anyone saw NIO LI XPEV shooting up to their levels? That‚Äôs the beauty of investing... no one really knows for sure where something will end up.

IMO is it worth To throw a chunk you‚Äôd be ok losing? Absolutely, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. It could be at $2.50 for all we know tomorrow, but the possibility of it being even $10 in the next year, is worth the risk.
After this weekend I‚Äôm going back into NIO stock until it gets investigated for fraud.

I was so focused on the subtitles it took me a while to realize it was spanish

^(spanish is my mother tongue)
Convinced me, they look really strong. Dropping 2k into $20c LEAPs at open. Hoping for a 10 bagger
Luck in coffee I think?!

It‚Äôs their earnings week you fucking retard lmao. And ZM has been a meme stock all year
FOMO just starting to set in lol, are you kidding?
Had a buddy get in Tesla at like 400-500 pre split. It was climbing nicely and I warned him of it possibly pulling back. He said "Nahh Elon is going to conquer the world." I politely kept warning him, but yet the stock kept proving me wrong. Well everyone knows what Tesla ended up doing, so I looked like the retard that I am.
Just keep it simple set a stop loss for that you want to make off your trade and leave it at that.
Lmao AAWW hit its peak exactly a month ago when this post was made and it has fell 20% since then.
Same I‚Äôm selling today and buying back in on Monday in the run up to earnings
This is absolutely insane. Can you honestly keep buying NIO XPEV LI? 

The bottom has to fall out soon right?
[deleted]
Why Li over Baba money?
On nothing right ?
"NIO very high, thanks to my great relationship with China!" *immediately tanks back to 30*
Guess I‚Äôm shorting TSLAü§ë
My 1/15/21 calls agree
Every time WSB is 100% on a stonk it collapses (Who‚Äôs the jackass that was pushing purple?)

IV crush really just is a technicality. IV crush often happens together with a big change in the underlying. Sure you'll lose on vega, but on average the expected delta gains compensate that.
America was the manufacturing hub of the world before that damned Biden got elected and sent all our jobs to China.


But for real the erosion of the blue-collar worker in America is sad.
AMD finally gonna run, that 90 dollar mark been eluding it for too long

Historically, dating back to 1928, SPY has closed green 56.1% of the time on Friday the 13th. That being said, it's 2020 so it'll most likely go red. That is of course until the MMs realize we're playing the inverse and inverse us.
I feel like futures are up too High to open flat
60ish but it‚Äôs night pump past that for a bit
I feel this except. This is logical. And that‚Äôs why it won‚Äôt happen
So FSR then?
* **PPI (MoM-Oct)**
   * 0.4% - Previous
   * 0.2% - Forecast
   * 0.3% - Actual
* **Core PPI (MoM-Oct)**
   * 0.4% - Previous
   * 0.2% - Forecast
   * 0.1% - Actual
Why is Nikola dropping then?
Trying to decide as well.

Have a 10 meeting that I won‚Äôt be able monitor so I think I‚Äôll just sell after open.
Entt√§usch mich nicht Brudi
Top comment someone change it
That‚Äôs false, but it certainly helps to be otherwise healthy.
The stock market is there for me when I need it the most
Should we buy NIO today?
Zoom has been climbing since January. This guy is a clown.
Massive ZM selling volume spiked just now. Someone knows something
One taketh one giveth
Bought a single call expiring today strike price of $55 just to laugh as It expired worthless after selling my $50 strike price calls what a dumb bitch. On the flip side I YOLO‚Äôd spy calls expiring today as well at the bottom yesterday so that‚Äôs nice
Go sniff children were talking stonks here
We found the alt right Republican
Fuck ur EV companies, DKNG Baby!!!!!
Wasn't it like that for tesla too though?
DKNG is gone. Once it starts triggering all the shorts we will have liftoff.
NIO FOMO getting strong, that means it's the top lol 

Nice DKNG spike
Looks like I‚Äôm gonna be staring at the NIO chart all day again hating myself ü•∫
Hey guys I‚Äôm a huge nio bull but I can tell by there a trim coming. I suggest pulling out at open then getting back in after the dip. Take your profits then re enter later on, it‚Äôs too high right now
Yea don‚Äôt follow chief?
I‚Äôm currently shorting it but I definitely see it touch 500+ again before any vaccine is mass produced. Good luck to us brother.
Looks like a butt plug.
Its down now
Damn
You do realize Biden isn‚Äôt president until January, right?
Fuck America they‚Äôre all dumping
Lol do it thanks for the sacrifice
Trumps legacy will be having educated the world on how exponential growth curves work.
Nice one !
More than likely we open flat and slow grind up.
But... you already have 2k...
What‚Äôs the difference between a girlfriend and the stock market?
the age of tesla is over, it's time for Nio.

100$ by end of year.   have people learned nothing from the 170 to 2000$ tesla run.
PTON going to mountain climb to 150 by Turkey Day. Bet the rent money on it.

You do that, I‚Äôll buy puts, let‚Äôs trade notes next week
I laughed but that wouldn't be the worst idea. Usually equities rally another 15% on News of split.
It's over grandpa... put the remote down
Happy Friday the 13th everyone.
$500 EOD
Holding my 17.5c 12/18 contracts. Figured Fisker would moon on the back of Chinese EVs.
it goes tits up if there is no dip though
Normally 20 percent.
too true on the wfh.. us companies failed to ship jobs overseas because their management is incompetent. Now they have a chance to learn remote management at their leisure, then once perfected, guess where the jobs will go.
Omg the jump on Li auto is crazy
1/15 50c is expensive as fuck now
Power efficiency‚Äî> less heat ‚Äî> more overclockable ‚Äî> higher performance (on desktop)

Desktop and other ‚Äúhigh performance‚Äù niches in semiconductors are AMDs bread and butter. If it turns out that Apples M1 chip is competitive in a desktop setting, this could open up tons of development and demand into ARM chips for windows. In this case, Qualcomm has a huge lead

Whoops!  I misread.  Then yea, I agree!!

This sub has been filled with Nio for a long time...
I probably will before earnings, grab some 1/21 puts. I honestly hope it keeps going up, it‚Äôll make the fall that much better.
BABA needs to get a move on today
To everyone playing DKNG, we gonna sell if we hit 50 today or we rolling over into next week?
Buy the zm dip or ride back to 350s
Yes... yes I am
Thanks dude, really appreciate the insight here!
Chinese people already don't really drive Chinese made cars

why would they all of the sudden all drive Chinese EV's
People that wrote the calls
It‚Äôs been that way for months, you just only got on the NIO wagon now
If you're a call **seller**, you're losing boatloads as the ticker goes up.
Today?
NIO literally bear trapped us
Zoom wrong way homie
Good luck to the nio players. Hope you all make tendies

It‚Äôs over.
But I don‚Äôt know you, you cold called me.

Market needs to open so I can close out and go back to sleep.
You can donate 13k to any number of individuals, tax free, once per year per individual. Neither of you will be liable for taxes on the money, and you get to claim it as a straight deduction in the following tax year.

Edit: that‚Äôs 13k per person, not in total. Total is unlimited. So, if you have any family that needs money, this is a great way to help. Or random redditors, lol
Call sellers dummy
2k on NIO at open. want to make enough to buy that new mac mini baby
Anyone who inverses WSB is preparing to declare bankruptcy.
Appreciate the input :) , thank you! 

Got my fingers-crossed!
NIOs still going up but my gut is telling me todays gonna be weird.... might sell and buy shares in li autos..
When literally every other comment on wsb is about one stonk, you know it‚Äôs about time to get out of it
What an earth are you talking about!! NIO is almost passing Volkswagen, which makes it ONLY 3rd largest car manufacturer by market cap and is ALREADY producing 1/250th of cars per year as Volkswagen.
Why what happen?
I need to unload them....

Yes! We‚Äôre all just in your dream! Wake up please so my puts can print
Nothing is really up besides EV. Lmao
[deleted]
No that‚Äôs beast king.
harder to sell a turd you can smell
I've learned my lesson. Never buy puts on Chinese EVs.
THat's what they all say to make themselves feel better about their shitty views. You can actually progress/evolve get better in life, you know.
11/16 spy calls gonna print this morning. to hold, or to sell hastily while i'm clocking into my bullshit 12-hour wage dumbass job
Zoom dying. Again?ü§î
Buying FSLY puts today. The pop on positive Tik Tok news is a good buying opportunity. If you look at Tik Tok‚Äôs careers page, it is obvious that they are looking to bring CDN functionality inhouse and build it themselves.
Lol I‚Äôm such a bitch for selling my NIO calls yesterday
Those getting into NIO now, you know what happens when this sub is filled with chatter on one Ticker. And if you don‚Äôt, then ...
LETS GO NIO AND DKNG!!!!!
Wtf zoom
Not luring but more just short term traders scalping. Anyway we go up and come back down are the luring days. It‚Äôs hard to tell tho because we always get random BS vaccine news
It has a honest business and they atent cooking their books.  It all come crashing down.
"ITS THE FUTURE"
The market has been trying to price in a housing crash that will never happen. A lot of housing related stocks are trading way below where they should be.  Imagine being bearish on housing at 2% interest rates and a flood of printed money.  Sometimes institutional investors are more retarded than anyone.
Keep buying EVs retards
Idk why ACB is still green
Zoom drilling because Trump might win second term so no more lockdown?
HAHAHHA so puts at open? And then calls at the bottom of dip sell on Monday
Don‚Äôt try it, it‚Äôll hurt ur soul
am retart. buying NIO 11/20 60C's. Here is to me going homeless in December. GLTA
Yeah not feeling too hot about my calls rn üò´
I'm not worries about their long game. But prob bought to soon
What's a good trailing stop % for ITM calls expiring today?
3 of them out of nowhere, sounds like weed hype to me
I‚Äôm down to watch Trump try to explain statistics on a little chalkboard next to a fireplace
Sold at a loss...
Didn't buy options for this play, as I couldn't justify the downside to this trade, so I ended up just buying 2k shares.
Puts on NIO? Lol
[deleted]
FSR is mooning
But sometimes, some things... turn into dumb things.
It won't go much past 60 if it does. It'll be a large % loss, but I shouldn't have to sell my leaps to buy them back EOD.  


I hope.
I have nio already so I'm going to buy Li at open
Buy more nio?
I will do you one better, i have missed 5000 life changing plays.
Uh oh that lasted so long.
I have Fisker and fastly calls. Holy shit, I think I‚Äôm just gonna sell at open
i had to cut losses yesterday, china stonks are risky
I laugh every time I see this meme. That dude‚Äôs bong hit stance is so aggressive.
I wouldn't short, still risky for it to moon even more and then crash. No telling how high it goes though
NIO call sellers have to be sweating absolute bullets right now
YOLO, you only lose once?
RSI on NIO daily is higher than half this subs IQ
Am I dreaming or is NIO really that high?
Remember those times when PRPL was a thing
Drilln‚Äôt
That's another reason why you never tell anyone even your closest friends that you invest. Suddenly everyone's an expert in investing yet you're the only one doing it.
My sugar boo, I'm levitating
My 1 nio call might keep in the game longer
Nothing wrong with locking in gains.
It's been the same here for about a week. If you shorted then you'd be fucked
Whats ur play? Ill join ya
Yeah I‚Äôm selling today, it‚Äôs Friday a dip is likely to happen. Go back in or move on to next and enjoy profit up 200%
Yes
this fucking manipulation with GME is gonna make me more retarded

Buy NIO now at open OR Li Autos and hope for that trifecta effect?
Wehre do you see it EOY? Is it like LI and XPEV where it can potentially shoot up to $30 EOY? Or is it not as established. i havent been studying the Western EV market, only China so far.

But based off the growth right now, it looks like its following the same projectory as LI and XPEV and NIO..
Since this is not the standard retarded WSB type response, I need to capitalize on your insight here.  When you say "run people", are you talking about luring people in, then stopping them out and once they're done with that, then they start selling short?
this is the god of all PM fades
You can always buy or sell more. That's not financial advise
If I was smart, I'd have more than one call haha. But it was the last $100 cash in my account at the time. Didn't want to sell other calls at a loss to get on NIO. But also didn't really see it going like this, kinda obvious, otherwise I would have gotten more calls before now.
So many peak American companies to pump but these clowns pump China. It‚Äôs sacrilegious
Some reason these usually pay off
NIO disagrees with you.
I sold my NIO 52c yesterday. I swear I thought it was the smart thing to do...
Id a shady company like carvana can tade at 3x sales no reaspn why VRM sould stay at 1x.  Looking for bounce back to mid 40s until next earnings
[deleted]
Only thing is it could moonto 80 then just "crash" back to 50.
EV making money/progress = good for all
Typically, It's a wise decision to not buy at open most of the time, but this isn't a normal scenario. There's a chance it'll dip at some point, but I think there's a bigger chance that it won't. 

It's a gamble. But it's probably a winning one. If you want to maximize profit, in this situation and this situation alone, it might be a good idea to buy at open. It will probably be the fairly cheapest chance you have today.
Solo is a good stock. Weird product but people seem to like it. Imma get in solo after my nio play is done
I don‚Äôt think you guys realize how crazy this is about to get. Probably going to hit $55 easily. Articles coming out about China EV market and the volume will flood in. Yesterday the first 10 min candle had 8 MILLION volume. SPY had 743k. Might get calls at open, it‚Äôs straight up from here

Sold mine for 270% and feel amazing about it. Glad the guy who bought em is gonna get some too
I bitched but bought $59 calls on the dip lol
Reverse DRILL
Because the year is 2020 and not much makes sense nowadays.
I don‚Äôt even need to watch NIO to know when to short, I just needed to look here this morning lmao
Why isn‚Äôt RIDE on this EV roller coaster ?

Not to mention both nio and xpeng base prices are much more affordable than Tesla
So, the full list is avaliable to read. Nio, li, and xpeng are not on the list. They dont deal with the PLA.

I like being redundant redundant
Chinese EV's are about to teach this sub a great lesson on non-GAAP Earnings and the lengths the Chinese government will go to fuck Americans
The saltiness over people not playing NIO is funny as fuck. The volume has been in the hundreds of millions all week and your bitchy ass spent more time bitching about the ‚Äúspam‚Äù instead of buying a single call. Yea I‚Äôm glad the EV talk dominated the daily thread because it made me a months salary instead of playing any other boomer or tech shit that‚Äôs done nothing. 

Anyway. NIO 60 EOD.
Imagine closing LI calls yesterday
Gains are gains, imagine if NIO was down -5% rn. How would you feel then?
Buy puts. Nio is going to drop faster then a hot plate in a child hands. Mark my words.

Most advice on this board will lose you money, so I‚Äôd count that as a win
It‚Äôs the dealers just stop running people. People who go long and short here put very tight stops (protraders, not rh). That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs clustering here. Once they run everyone, it gravitates towards max pain.
[deleted]
You HAVE to realize that people said that EXACT same thing about Tesla right?? Like you gotta

Does anyone else scales into puts on NIO, LI, XPEV?

I must say my last few days put scaling has not gone the absolute bestest, my thesis was standing mainly on "sell the news/ER" legs, yeah...
There‚Äôs bound to be an actual correction soon enough. It‚Äôs on a rampage. Historically, they‚Äôve had sell offs after every earnings, good or bad. But it might be different this time.

God nio is seeping into my brain, fucking chinese 5g fuck off
Not for long
NIO $15 eom c‚Äômon let‚Äôs wipe half of this sub out
I think 60 today is a bit of stretch, maybe next week?
Never. Everyone was talking about Tesla puts a few months ago. Realistically you‚Äôd have to have been very lucky to make money off Tesla puts with perfect timing. It‚Äôll be the same thing with Nio. Just not worth the risk to reward.
I‚Äôm with you brother. Cheers to us
Yeah I‚Äôm in this dilemma too lol
11/20 baba calls? What the fuck is even happening to Ma?

No. Sold at 3:59
People blame china for all the evil yet pour money into chinese stocks. Hypocrisy level:2020
You don‚Äôt need to put the ~ if you‚Äôre gonna say about anyway
So far every Chinese EV earnings has pumped all the others too, really want to hold my NIO call through earnings, it's already up 1300% before this latest rocket.

Not exactly true 
But not false either
Definitely thought about buying 2, believe me! Ran all the scenarios in my head last night while I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

And I don‚Äôt plan to buy at market open, may not but at all if it continues to rise at this pace.

Have other smaller plays lined up just incase!
COVID is fake
ZM call holders are fucked...including me
Depends, when do you want to lose money?

NIO = EV + Chinese people= investment
Hell yea..... NIU is starting to get some of that magic Ghyna EV juice!!!!

If you read the report you would know that their loss was largely because of stock based compensation to employees and other listing fees. This loss wont go into the next quarter. If you subtract the loss from their listing they made 73mil this quarter or 0.08 eps, up 400% from the projected 0.02 eps. Apparently no one is able to understand this.
Data is the new oil and these guys have been secretly mining it for 13 years. As policing moves digital these guys are going to be running the whole show, not to mention half their money comes from the US military which basically has bottomless pockets.
We need to ban traffic
Sry between selling spy puts too early and selling nio calls too early total missed gains are about $80k for the year
hell yeah, pig gang!!!
its gonna print, you gonna quit your job by end of day
i hate how we can all picture an old guy with a boot gun
Realistically when is it time to buy NIO puts? $100? 200?
If you looking to buy into NIO buy into Li Auto instead. When price of Nio goes up so does Xpev AND Li Auto. The Trifecta.
When do you intend to sell? Does the rapid rise in the price concern you?
[deleted]
is there any reason why its surging other than just because its a Western brand EV? Are they potentially 2nd to Tesla?

RKT I think it's a bad day to be short this
[deleted]
It‚Äôs donkey dick is going to swing until institutions can get ahold of it.
split calls into all LI NIO and XPEV? 

with 10k, you can probably buy between 5-7 calls for 2022. I would do 2 NIO leaps, 2 XPEV, and 1 LI. or like 3 NIO, 2 XPEV, 2 LI
You eluded to it by saying that North Americans weren't about to invent the car. 

With regard to them being closer, no they weren't. They were just as far away (about 5,000 miles). 

Even if Americans had invented the car, how would that justify genocide? How are they even connected? It's like saying the holocaust was good because because Nazi scientists got us to space or because Hitler gave us the Beetle.
I remember when it dropped 7% at open the other day and was green by close.
Well screw you too
I‚Äôm not sure yet, probably about tree fiddy 

But seriously I *need* Li to dump. Thought I bought put at the peak but nope, pure autist.
60 might be the top so you gucci
did I miss some vax pump, why is dow and small cap futures higher than nasdaq?
DKNG NOV20 50c at open 

Big truss
Welp, should've sold my puts yesterday. Today's gonna be green
Baba has consolidated at 266... it‚Äôs going to pop off any day now
I had a stop order set at $22 yesterday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I really wanted to own shares for NIO back in October but it was going to cost me too much to buy what I wanted. So I bought a NIO Jan 2021 45c for 200 to get some exposure and boy is it paying off
Tell you what . Ill stay away from the calls and just ride these put so everyone should be ok.
But that just means retail investors are on board which is good for everyone
I sold out yesterday after buying SPAQ. Little chapped right now.  But still made profit.
check out NIO. not many people have heard of it
Does rolling a position count as realizing gains/losses?
Nah, NIO and XPEV will beat Li. Both are backed by Chinese big boys, and Nio has the luxury angle while XPEV make one of the cheapest, best EVs on earth.
EV stocks, so hot right now
Pltr January calls?
Maybe if investors ask nicely they'll help the Chinese government gather intelligence on U.S. allies
MACD for NIO looking strong af with no signs of a selloff anytime soon. RSI is overbought but that's because it's trending up like.

I‚Äôm gonna buy the rights to this sub with the profit from my 1 NIO 50c 11/27
Would you like to know how i lost 6500 on tsla?
gonna use my NIO money to buy a TSLAüòé
I bought shares of NIO when it was $17 and figured I‚Äôd buy more when it dipped. Still waiting.
Should I buy NIO at the top?
a very rude awakening lol

Have you heard about the new virus?   It‚Äôs called China EV.  You came back positive for it.
Sold my nio position of 2000 shares back when it hit 40. 30 to 40. Wish I had held on, but feel like it's too late to get back in, no way to tell how high it will pump but too risky at the moment unfortunately that's why I'll never get rich
[deleted]
So was is that, like 121 vehicles instead of 100?
Do I look Chinese to you?

Could be worse, you could've took profit on leaps at $8.... I'd be fucking retired. Clown gang reporting for duty.

I just really need DKNG to gap up today above 50. Please.
I would like to shake the hand of LI‚Äôs corrupt, book cooking accountant. I expect his great work on NIOs ER as well. Triple Ripper
Omg NIO shills are so annoying. Hope NIO crashes below $5 and wipes out half of this sub.
Tempted to sell all my pltr shares and take a 10% loss and put it on xpev & li. Thoughts? Might wait weeks and weeks to make up my pltr loss but I can gain it in a day or two with xpev & li
Congrats to all Chinese ev holders.  Little salty over here lol total missed gains about ~50k now
Well its been priced in for years now considering it stays in the upper 30s
I Fucking hope so. Holding 1200 shares. Not exactly sure what my entry point is because this shit keeps going up at an alarming rate
BABA to 250 today
Feeling good. Started plowing money in.
Solid and good
Nah, I'll stick with $LI for now
NIO 1/21 65C gang wya?  Do we hold till earnings?
Set a Trailing stop loss % that you decide on selling if it dips that much and it trails for you until cancelled.
Yes. Everyone buy calls after on Chinese car stocks after they are up 30%? Don't get mad at i just think thats fucking stupid and that's why you are here.
Same. I thought it was friday yesterday ü§°  seeing the pre market price, i would be well over 200% right now
Why doesn‚Äôt your dick have his own account?
Lol I bought 20 nio 11/27 41c nov 3 and sol them the same day for a few hundred profit. Now worth over $20k ü§°
Yup, decent stuff. Volatile stock tho, but for the next year it should be good.
Is Yahoo Finance fucked or is PLTR swinging from up 4% to down 3% every 2 seconds
Holding Fisker through SPAQ days.. feeling validated !
Tough  resistance
Anybody know some Chinese penny stocks I can YOLO my portfolio into? Thinking software maybe?
I feel no remorse. This is our second stimulus check we never got.
Anyone are to explain how in the fuck the market is green right now? This shit is so manipulated i hate it
Zm back to 365
Get in now?
You will see 3 green opens in a row and then it will bleed red till close. On the third day you will decide to sell. The next morning will be green and you will say haha can‚Äôt wait for this shit to happen again. Then it goes up 5% that day.
Heard of false negatives. It's better to design a test that will occasionally have a false negative over a false positive.
China taken over the world.
Or even $1.66 a few months ago.

Shit, if I just would have seen one more meme about NIO I would have bought in earlier.
Get in Nio they‚Äôre all going to the moon

Doesn‚Äôt matter. These retards are gonna pump it without even looking. Calls at open

That's when they get you, third strike. BOOM the high wears off and people go "oh fuck we've gone up XXX%"
This doesn't mean he has Covid, it means that the test is generally unreliable. The creator of the test confirmed this.
ZM no don‚Äôt do this bb
seems up a bit at open?
With new lockdowns being announced by the day, i see it easily breaking 500 before christmas
don't let your dreams be dreams. This baby is going to $100

jk I wouldn't touch it
I think adding calls to XPEV and Li is the move if you also have nio right now
I don‚Äôt know where to put $10k. I need a 5 bagger. Li or Nio ?
Li Auto beat earnings and increased vehicles by 21% since Q2!!
Good idea
Immer gerne!
Yup
Now that we‚Äôre past earnings, if the IV drops a bit, I was thinking those 1/21/ 22 15c may be of interest.
PRICED IN
FSLY üò≤
I'm with you bro. It's just so unpredictable. People here get burned the day it dips with their weeklies. They are sheeps and most people have no idea what they're doing. Not flaming them, I'm glad some people make a lot of money off nio and I hate myself for not jumping in but I got burned so often by watching things go up and up and the moment I join it dips.
Worst part is once I capitulate and buy it‚Äôs all over for the Chinese ev industry üòÇüí∞üî•
Buy shares
If Amd hits 83 during market hours, we‚Äôll gap fill to 85. I have foreseen it
Much more than that. The positive result is almost certain, the negative result can be wrong in a high percentage of tries if you have covid. Unless it's another test which I don't know.
It's a long play, these guys are the puppet masters behind so many different things. They probably know what color the last crap was you did.
Ya it does suck. I mean when I get home it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to get to interact with anyone and just stay in the basement. It‚Äôs being there but not. 

I mean sitting here atm at Detroit international airport and delta is full. And I did fly during the lockdown and the delta flight I took had two people on it from providence Rhode Island to Atlanta. Atlanta was empty on March 23rd. It was really weird. That connection from Atlanta to kc had just me on a 737. 

Delta and southwest didn‚Äôt recover all the way from the March 23rd but at 35 and 42 a share as it stands today.  The bottom back then for them was delta around 23 dollars a share for delta and southwest hit 32 a share March 23rd. 

So now looking at sit down restaurants like Darden restaurants (DRI) ( Olive Garden long horn steak house Eddie v‚Äôs red lobster) tanked back on the March 23rd lockdown at 34 a share and it‚Äôs almost at 107 today. 

So looking at Puts @ 65 dollar stoke price for 23 cents per put on December 18th looks like a cheap gamble to me for (DRI). I would say food looks like a cheap bet and a bigger bottom to drop out again. Keep an eye out and we can help each other so I don‚Äôt have to go out in this crap anymore. 

Going back to your statement of a stimulus. I have my worries that trump will not do it while he‚Äôs in office since he‚Äôs too busy with lawsuits over voter fraud. I have little faith he will help anyone out but himself.  

And another lockdown while he‚Äôs in office is doubtful but.... on the other hand hospitals are reaching capacity in a lot of places and it will get worse. But again will he do a lockdown?  I have my doubts on that too. Gonna be hard to hit this bear market.
$ELON
Be aware that the price you see now will be much higher when trading starts in 1.5 hours. The prices showing up right now are reflections of yesterdays closing price. So if you see $3.30 per call for 55c 11/27, expect that to probably double instantly at open.

Set for market purchase if you want to get in as soon as trading starts. No chance that a limit purchase will be executed. Also, try at least to buy two. It's always more satisfying. No matter what, you'll always think "if only I had bought more" (providing that it's doing good) but at least youll make double what you would have made with just one.

If your worried about if you'll win or lose, I'm pretty sure you will win. That's just one mans opinion, though.
That is nice. The thing i saw was some kind of half car on 3 wheels

Unrelated to NIO but don‚Äôt forget that neither Dems nor Cons want a stimulus bill done, can‚Äôt let people get used to the idea of free money even if they desperately need it
told myself I was going to sell some of my RKT calls going into close before earnings on Tuesday (told myself that when I bought them if it spiked going into close I‚Äôd sell), didn‚Äôt, value dropped 80% at open the next day despite good news
Yeah man it's gonna dip 19% at open from where it's at premarket.
just did root canal my retired dentist has make shift office at home. $975 with teeth cleaning and happy ending. cant beat it
You known what that means.
PLTR LEAPS yay or nay
I love my nio shares but I was just looking at epev and if I would have bought into them instead my $40k would now be worth over 120k. Holy fuck that‚Äôs insane. Still riding the Nio train though. $100 by 2022

NIO is gonna be my one regret forever. I been eyeing it since early June at sub 10 dollars, and now it's 52 and a full blown meme on here. I could've changed my life with NIO, but for one reason or another, I kept missing out. Sucks man.
First thing I thought, this 'pump' is going fuck my tech holdings lmao.
YESS BABY YESSSS!!!!!! ü§§ set your trail stops. We making money today!!
you know they release earnings on Tuesday, and if xpev killed it, then you know nio did

I know this is a retard sub, but even here there must be limits to how insane shit you can spew.
So now there's 3 Chinese EV companies with some of the biggest market caps in the World. Nothing odd about that.
Looks like someone didn‚Äôt buy NIO.
ü§î
so even after all the run up, i could have put all my money in li ah, and copped 25% of it back? fuck man im so bad at this game
You ever saw a NIO car on the road?
She‚Äôs already rich beyond her dreams.  Doubt it.  At some point what are you gonna do with all the money?
Too late, opportunity is missed
I only have 4 forever hold positions: MSFT, APPL, AMD and AMZN.  And I say forever loosely because although I entered them a decade ago, I have no problem selling half it there is a 5% downturn.

Per your question about value, value only has value if it's not dead.  All these folks buying things that are cheap now need to be certain they are coming back or else it's not a value play but a gamble.  Hey, buy them for quick turns all the time.  When PFE announced 90% efficiency, AAL MGM and AMC all jumped at least 25%.  I know full well I could be wrong but right now, I'm not buying value because they are cheap.  I'm buying value because the slightest catalyst causes them to pop.
Everyone sniffing round NIO when PLTR is the real bitch in heat.
Should I wait till like 10 for nio calls or right at 930
You could say this at a time about literally anything
Going to try shorting some NIO here at 52.50

Nio is eventually going to have one red day of like -1% and all of the NIO bears are gonna go "I KNEW IT". Congrats NIO bears - you will go from -99% to -98%

Nio xpev gang üöÄüöÄ
Here‚Äôs another perspective: BABA after last weeks dump was ranging daily from 285 to 300 range. At that point you could buy 295 calls at the bottom of the range and then 295 puts at the top of the range and make money strangling it both ways. I had sold my puts and held my calls Tuesday expecting it to ramp up the next day, and *I didn‚Äôt hold puts overnight* - that is stupid and an obvious mistake. 

It tanked that night and if I had held my puts on strangle (as I should have) they would have been worth 980% profit each, bought in at 1.70 (170)and sold for 24 (2400) a piece. That‚Äôs unreal. And it‚Äôs an expensive lesson about hedging a volatile stock.
Tesla has the self driving angle though
Holding through if LI/XPeng were anything to go by
I'm tempted to diamond hands but I'll probably bow out today or monday at the latest, and either enter back in with spreads or a put maybe.

Hahaha dude... you ever see the VW bug. Also market SUCKS that saggy ball sack rn because of election, lockdown, and virus. 

People are FOMO over Ev gains and are gunna folk here. The volume is insane. And solo being around 5$ everyone wants to get It gets to where ever. It‚Äôs earnings for EVs rn and EVs are undoubtedly the future. 

They don‚Äôt just make that 3 wheeled car but if I lived in a big ass city, I‚Äôd want a small car that I can park any where. 

They gunna tank... someday. But imma ride this EV waveeeee and hope I don‚Äôt fall off
I think you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm gonna sell half and let the other options sit. It‚Äôs pretty much free now.

Yeah right BABA I‚Äôm not falling for it again
the difference is NIO has more mkt cap than both of those two combined & a higher market cap than daimler (mercedes)

but hey if youre ok with the risk

it can definitely pop higher but the risk grows on every one of these rallies

If u haven made money on Chinese EV by this time I have no FUCKING words but:  GET IN RETART WE HEADING TO ATH AGAIN TODAY
Don't worry. I'll try my best to ride the PoS to the ground when the time comes. Same with Li and XPeng.

Rapid antigen tests are known to give false -ves but not false +ve. That means if musk's antigen test came back +ve, he likely has Covid.

I‚Äôm so fucking depressed for dumping all my NIO options yesterday when it was at $44.  I hope it crashes soon, but it looks like it‚Äôs gonna move just like Tesla.
I love this sub.
You buy stock in a company. The individual stock unit is shares. No idea wtf scrips is.
How we feeling after LI earnings?
my plan was to do the same but it never moved all week so i held through earnings
[deleted]
Thats a DLC
If you don‚Äôt buy calls today you hate money
Oh shit
Let's go
I‚Äôm not buying RKT you fucking mongoloid
Pltr bag holder here. It's getting worse today pre m
Got 200 shares at 38.75 not sure if I'm safe yet. Setting a stop loss at 50
Since when did WSB go German? Now we can really tap the minds of the Europoors r/mauerstrassenwetten
Damn man. Don‚Äôt do it. Don‚Äôt crash the party for us. Wait until Monday.
Shut up and buy NIO calls
I hate myself for fucking up nio. Told myself to buy at 27 nope. Buy at 32 NOPE. Short at 49 YeS Do tHaT wtf is the matter with me
I bet ‚Äúbuy the nio dip‚Äù will be screamed all day as it creeps to 40
Lmao to those who bought NIO puts at close yesterday. How‚Äôs the asshole?
Yh I think it‚Äôs vastly independent holders. I think it‚Äôll keep running up to earnings solely off hype. Idk where it‚Äôll peak but I can‚Äôt see it passing 65
3 fillings for $800 ?? Is my dentist fr
I sold 39c a few days ago
Pulled back .33% since the I check 2 hours ago, it ain't over until its over.
Yes but I shit my pants almost every morning so it isn‚Äôt of any real significance.
Everyones like "how are you going to pick up a date in that small piece of shit?" 

Jokes on you bud, I dont get dates anyway. Sign me up.
That's the stressful part of short term investing. Right now at least, I'm investing shares in companies I believe in long term and calls in companies I believe in short term. My share account is much much bigger than my calls acount.
Looking at the Nio graph it's like a ponzi scheme about to pop.
Also less volatile more chances of inclusion into S&P down the line.
BIG GREEN DAY
Those exist as well be but when you go through hot in wsb atm, most the posts are nio
They haven't changed. We have
yeah really confirms a lot of bears invest on this kind of logic "It had a really really good run so now it has to come down". When I first bought into NIO some random guy told me he had puts because NIO has "been such a disappointment"... like wtf are you even talking about.
the Chinese rug pull is coming, get in and out of calls while you can.
That‚Äôs your account
You didn‚Äôt buy during trump tantrum yesterday?

F
I will say this: I had hedged BABA calls with weekly puts due to feeling I should have a strangle as it was bouncing between 285 and 300. If I had kept those puts instead of selling them when it dipped just a little, I would have made 980% on each of them and had my biggest profits ever, outpacing my weekly 295 calls expiring worthless. It‚Äôs an expensive lesson. But made almost all my BABA loss up on a bunch of SPY 1DTE put scalps yesterday, so onward !
NIO is not bad but LI is the real deal, back to back to back 20% gappers. Just went you though you're retarded buying the top, it gapes again
Li Q3 numbers were good so to the moon for all 3.
[deleted]
Winemakers HATE this one weird trick!!!
GE Leaps almost in the money, DKNG Leaps a little out of the money.
I sold NIO in the 14s if that makes you feel better
It won‚Äôt dip till after earnings and I believe it won‚Äôt even dip to where it is now so how‚Äôs the right time
Bro! That‚Äôs what burned me too!!!! I was heavy in BABA thinking it was only going up from there because it was just good news left and right for baba and Chinese stocks... like wtf. Appreciate the advice and glad someone can relate
What if NIO is a Trojan Horse sent by the MM‚Äôs to wipe out WSB
60 maybe today or Monday

I see Eric andre I upvote
I don‚Äôt think you know what insider trading is
already got 5 11/27 calls. I'm safe AF
Don't listen to all these people. You don't have to pay taxes for another year. By the time you do. you'll have more money.
Imagine Jerome Powell printing money to keep stock market up but people still buying poots. Until the fed puts away their liquidity tools, all these companies can get free money on no sale and continue to moon. It‚Äôs rampant fraud but that‚Äôs how the game is played.
The only thing in common is high volume and up 40% yesterday. Some times it's easier just to follow and flip based on momentum rather than swim against the current. You do you. I think it's a shit company, but I've made a lot since yesterday.

Their valuation is higher now than a year ago after a 120% EPS drop and over 30% drop  in revenue. No end in sight for the trouble in their tourist segments.

Disney+ can't keep growing in subscribers if their catalog doesn't grow with it.
Cough pump and dump cough
Any pullback at all on open and I'm going in
I was gonna ask which company between NIO, XPEV & LI but I see the NIO pin.
Why‚Äôs this ps5 do all these things but no haptic bootyhole feedback. Seems like an obvious feature

Jan 50c maybe close to breakeven at open but picked up some shares at $40
You are a donut.\*
I sure hope so cuz it just won‚Äôt stop going up
No reason to scroll past this comment

NIO XPEV LI DKNG RKT
But the Mandelorian broo
Get ready to sell your calls guys because I'm finally buying NIO calls at open
Just need AMZN to pop. Why can‚Äôt it announce an ev. Or at least sell all these Chinese ev on its website
I bought spy puts cause it‚Äôs now higher than in February. It‚Äôll rocket to 365 for no reason
I‚Äôm not sure I even believe in the company tbh. But I‚Äôll take these wins
I prefer YOLO.
Whoever did the DD on Nio like 4 months ago...you are a godsend.  I will find your post and print it out and frame it.
Without a doubt ....
This morning pump is both insincere and experimenting with an alternative lifestyle. I do not approve.
Told my self there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs green today after yesterday‚Äôs rally and sold out at +30% on shares EOD. Looks like it isn‚Äôt done.
Meanwhile I‚Äôm in DIS calls
Fkkkk imma buy it back.. my ego is too big to admit loss but this shit could run to 60 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

No its not, if its primarily hype driving the stock than its way above any sensible valuation, and a short position makes a lot of sense.
yeah i usually sell OTM short dated covered calls to hedge off theta decay on my long dated calls. I bought back half my covered calls on NIO, should've bought them all fml
TSLA was going to do battery swap but I think they stopped it because people preferred to own their battery rather than constantly trading it out.

Me too, the blue one has option CFDs on oil, etc.
If it reaches 100 I will tattoo the NIO logo on my balls.

Sooooooo, are 0DTE 55 strikes on the menu?
Shh don‚Äôt tell
I had a bunch of money in VALE on longer dated options. Gave up on it right before it did it‚Äôs bounce a week or so after battery day. Freaking obnoxious. Oh well. Onwards!
I told myself to hold Nio calls until the end of the week.. just do it for once... but clearly I don‚Äôt have diamond hands
Brethren, wait until morning dip on EV before going in
Are we going to look back and be like "i remember when NIO was $50" üò¢
ALL of them cause when NIO smashes its earning, they all gonna be mooning again
It's still at a reasonable market cap compared to the other insanely overvalued EV companies...
NIO call writers. I‚Äôm comin fo yo shares.
we're mooning today

He said, "son, we're not that kind of family"

And then I reaped that field of wheat night and day

And I worked and I worked and I worked

And I saved and I saved and I saved

And I bought NIO 60C 0DTE 11/13
Disney parks shuttered nearly the whole year, movies are in the shitter, espn is on its death bed, tourism is still a ghost town

Still don't get how they are valued the same as 9 months.

You forgot about NFLX. More than likely we will see another 5% move up within the next week based on the charts
Don‚Äôt do that to yourself lmao I sold a bunch of $53 yesterday. Profit is profit
I trade CFDs not options.
NIO is Powell‚Äôs money printer confirmed
Solo has nothing in common with either of those companies. No way it sustains sympathy highs. I just hope it goes higher so I can make a more conservative short strike.
roll the calls brother. this thing will be memed like nio by year end
#LI beat earningsüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Buy buy buy
It‚Äôs going to just keep rocketing FOMO is just starting to set in have you seen Nio volume? It‚Äôs nuts
Yeah, I enjoy watching it and see everyone spam excitement here though :)
NIO just made me cum
What do you think they'll do when they come back for more and you're not there to give food? They will get in and trash your place.
NIO level 2 showing more buyers than sellers
Jesus Christ I just need EVs to dip solidly so I can have good entry point
I'm retard, I bought 1 XPEV put.

But, I am also autistic genius, I bought 25 DKNG calls.

The duality of man.
‚ÄúWSB is too bullish on NIO. Going puts now is the smart play‚Äù

This statement was made every day for the last two weeks lmao
Li earnings good? Am driving HELP
So disappointed in myself for selling nio back at a 1.69
I believe they said the TAM is 100b currently, but they could always expand markets.
Better be A5
[deleted]
Mmmm organic NIO growth
I bought more
Seems kinda dumb to sell before earnings given what happened to XPEV and Li after earnings. My calls are for mid December, ITM already.
someone told me to buy solo in the summer, now it's up 250%, I didn't though of course
So these EV valuations are essentially just people betting on other people betting on other people betting on other people  ...... on one guy who actually thinks NIO will get to $420.69 per share.
Feel like there's too much energy behind it.

Buying as soon as markets open, definitely reaching 60$ before earnings
NIO NIO NIO NIO NIO NIO NIO NIO
If it expired today that wasn't a bad move usually.
Ye, it just feels like asking to be scammed at this point, like literally luckin coffee levels of retard growth
Wow. Nothing seems to be working for me.

Oink oink bitch
DO NOT SHORT NIO! Let it RIDE UNTIL EARNINGS
I sold my $42 11/27 calls yesterday when it was at $48 because there was no way in my mind that this bull run would continue.  I made a nice profit on a small gamble but holy shit it's at like $52 this morning.  Praying for a dip because I'm not buying back in at such a massive increase.
Over baby
One might say u r a pussy
Yessir this market has been range locked since Monday. Easiest money this week since the recovering after March lolol
Bough Nio leaps but kinda wish i bough weeklies
He‚Äôs been lookin real nice. Put 5 on tiger to win before the masters ( if u don‚Äôt bet on tiger ur not American). Hoping he wins I‚Äôll be 100 dollars richer
if Schwab is down yet again....
Hell yeah man!
BABA leaps?
Probably will tank after earnings
So LI could still pump?
BULL Bets today:
Nio
XPENG
PLTR
PTON
ZM
AMD
TSLA

please stonk gods be kind.
Holy fuk what is this company
Depends on how deep the crater is. It's also odd that a company like that can have such a mind blowing loss. It's built to suck govt agency tit and there has been no shortage of that in this administration. Dunno...maybe they overspent on that building in Denver.

People really think the majority of MM are gonna let you hold that NIO money over the weekend? Sheesh
End of Novemberish?
Take your own advice and don‚Äôt sell then. A win is a win, but it isn‚Äôt the WSB way.
if ur holding calls id sell b4 earnings

if ur holding shares then hedge

Got 51c, buying back for a loss for the 3rd time. Sold 44c 47c 51c all itm

Leave some üò∏ for the rest of us
I lost a lot on BABA this week too, good thing I have leaps dated 2022. Ant IPO was botched not only because of what Ma said, Ma said those things BECAUSE the regulators were already giving him a hard time. They wanted to avoid a debt crisis like 08, which is valid. Timing could have been better, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs that much conspiracy going on. They def wanted to tame Jack ma a bit, but that‚Äôs not the real reason
If it dips under 50 today then buy

WSB is a place for losing your entire inheritance, throwing your last $$ for rent on 1dte calls, or making enough to pay off your house. Nothing in between.
That NIO pre market is wild. Up 4 more dollars.
Waited for the Nio dip yesterday to buy more and it never came :(

just be glad you have what you have and always compare yourself to yourself.  as long as your better than last year that's all that matters

I don't even care anymore how much I've lost before now. Entire portfolio of mine shall be Chinese stocks and calls. Can't lose if China becomes too big to fail.
Pretty pumped pltr is dropping. Loading up on shares

That‚Äôs what scares me the most. PTSD kicking in

Haha yeah brother.

I was being sarcastic...  I‚Äôm looking for a 5 bagger - I think this is it. :-)

So everyone will pivot all the new EV gains back into TSLA once FSD is complete?

Omg vale
Fuck yeah congrats
Damn you never even went up a smidge, every call worst than your last. But who needs a Porsche, right?
Cool tip bro..... I will check it out.
Would y‚Äôall buy back $52 nio covered calls exp today or just let them execute (would ur answer change if those shares avg cost basis is $7)? Thanks
Are we fading the overnight bump
DIX with a pretty big spike.  Going with calls today
FSR is mooning in pre-market.
He doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs just talking the talk

Weird way to incinerate 700 bucks
Ah yes back to 355.50, which will it go from here? Flip a coin! Also, NIO $65 EOD.
At this point the pigs are becoming rich and buying weaponry of their own.

Here comes the 8am fade
Its okay man. I had 1,000 bitcoins in 2012 but spent 500 on ‚Äúfacemelting premium coke‚Äù that never came from silk road.

This is the type of insider trading i come for
When did fundamentals start mattering for EVs? Thought it was all about tech days, tweets, and stock splits.
Be careful buying NIO at open, max pain today is **$39**. Not saying it‚Äôs going there, but just letting you know MMs are already paying out a bag to call holders, don‚Äôt expect them to give much more! Happy trading!

No moat. No patent. 

You want to get rich call up a manufacture on alibaba and get them copy it for you. Sell it on a web site, call it 'Red Bed.' 

Then pay for google adword 'purple mattress' uncut the price and bingo.

I might truly be the most autistic person on this sub
Free Money
Literally trying the meme from yesterday lol
I miss the days of leaving a multi billion dollar bank bag holding a bunch of worthless calls
Do it, they had a great earnings just got fucked by that IPO expense. Get either LEAP or Shares although I have shares, think it's the better option
I have SQ Jan 210C.. they touched 200 on earnings so after the dip I thought they‚Äôd retest it...keeps dying
I bought nio at $17 on the news that it was issuing more shares. I made a whole $600 on that trade and felt great about it. I am the tard
Reminder: yolo into SOLO. Volume was really high yesterday and it's up a lot already.
Don‚Äôt worry boys, throwing my hand in Chinese EV calls today. All will crash

I bought nio at 4

But then sold at 7 lmao
I too was in NIO back when I was also in GNUS and XSPA. Fun times. But I just lost 70% of my account when Xi tanked BABA overnight on Tuesday. And I also know how to read. I‚Äôd be way bull on BABA long, but China international economic activity and party policy has been all the signs of strongman power moves lately. Their willingness to crush Jack Ma is nothing short of stunning, they shelved the biggest IPO in the history of the world just a week back.... and gave a heads up on new regulation, and pulled Ma into their offices like a dog on a leash... 

This isn‚Äôt a football game friend, there‚Äôs a lot more going on here.
Bro I fucking sold at $46.7... fuckkkk
Stripe is a private company they can say whatever they want.

About to buy my first ever call, 55c 11/27.

Hope you are right!
It dropped 10+% at one point this week and then got gobbled up. Careful, bro. This shit feels like TSLA did this summer.
That's amazing, congrats
should have sold more baba puts.. they've been bleeding into nothingness all week
Wow, NIO really gonna print again today. It‚Äôs like a never ending well.
Nice
Oh damn NIO DUMPING!
What do you mean start printing, its been printing all week!

Good entry for some PLTR stock buys today?
Vaccine plays if Moderna comes through with good news? Thinking AMC pump again
I miss those days when we use to say
"Money printer go brrrrrrr."
It will initially crash because of instability due to riots and shutdowns domestically. Trump believes that China is responsible for the voting machine scandal and has begun to wage a full scale trade war against them. China is heavily invested in our tech markets and will pull out quickly to create further instability.

Once the vaccine rolls out and people chill, well enter a strong and prosperous 4 year stretch in America led by Jerome and Orange man.

Go get Nio calls at open

Going balls deep 0dte calls. Raised guidance during these times? Holy smokes this will flyyy
Yeah but at a price average of 1.35 each? It was a steal. Should've gotten more
Omg! So many haters! Telling everyone to sell, BK, get out now they said. To be honest- they convinced me to sell a large piece of PTON(unnamed chat room that I‚Äôm still mad at lol). Some people laugh at you when you tell them what you bought and they say: look at that garbage, the short interest is at 40%!!! And I say: that‚Äôs one of the reasons I bought it. If it has the potential to turn around, that short interest is the fuel to FUCK every bear on the way up.
Ok, I‚Äôm going in
Well, his gain is your loss so, jerk off to that.

People saying to find a CPA don‚Äôt understand taxes. Once sold this will either be short term cap gain which is taxed at your ordinary income rate OR if you hold for longer than a year then sell it will be taxed as a long term cap gain which is 15%. Selling all alone is enough to put you between 32% and 35% individual brackets for 2020. There is no grey area when comes to capital gains. Nothing special a CPA can do for you here.

FSR doesn‚Äôt even have production yet and might be the next meme
I did the same thing. When market was on Easy Mode ran account up. Caught myself doing fomo and rage trades and went down to 30% of my holdings. Quit for a couple months. Saw market tank in Sept. Came back, and kept myself to day trading or swing trading monthlies and cut myself off at 20% profit or 10% loss of value, no matter what. Got account back up. Saw some patters on bull trends and started scalping. Got to 2x my account balance. Lost 70% of it because of BABA tanking overnight. Held that loss until yesterday before locking it in. 

Felt bad man. But, saw SPY overbought and bad news rolling in. Made a bold play and made 90% of it back it up the same dang day, on SPY 1DTE puts, and HD calls. 

Change strategy. Write down a plan for each day and stick to it. Don‚Äôt chase trades. It‚Äôs either your trade or it‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs okay to sit out for a while, and just watch the markets move. 

Good luck.
Fuck spy when you can get chy!

The colonists of North America didn't invent the car or the wheel either though :S

I imagine that most Americans would share your views that colonialism was more good than bad because it's the reason for your existence - in nations which used to be empires it's a little bit balanced (in the UK at least), but then if you look at the real population centres of the world - India, China, Nigeria, you'd get a resounding no because they were the victims of colonialism.

And btw, the debate about the morality of colonialism isn't new. It was happening back then too.

The revolt in Haiti especially lead to much more support for ending slavery and colonisation in the Carribbean, for example.
Remember when wsb wasn't a nio board.

Considering I bought 100 of these for $2 yesterday, goddamn you and congrats
Hang on man.  I never said there wasn't going to be a crash.  And I think that's what people have been jumping on.  Folks accusing me of saying, "This time its different" somehow are implying that I'm implying the market is forever buoyant. 

As a guy who took house positions on behalf of the bank, often against retail, I'm saying there is an objective difference in the flow of transactions now versus when I was employed to do it.

 Folks call it dumb money, as a trader I don't give a shit. It's transactions, not the rationalization behind the transactions.  I would love nothing more than to see one 60% pandemic crash every quarter. We didn't make money because we cared about direction.  We made money because commentators like you wanted to convince themselves that they could codify something that is inherently random on a moment to moment basis.  The more erudite the rationalizations were, the less money those guys who made them make.

Without sounding offsensive to you, you sound like a someone who is versed in the principle but per my original critique, not spent a day in the trenches.

Can't wait till baba  shakes that anchor from around its neck.
He doesn‚Äôt sleep
Bro it‚Äôs up to $52 per share... the only reason it‚Äôs going up is because of WSB... Boomers are slamming their heads into terminals as we speak  it‚Äôs eventually going to drop off...
As most stocks do when they have earnings the next morning doesn‚Äôt mean insider trading. Doesn‚Äôt mean it goes up.

The FOMO in NIO is real.
He debated Jack Ma (whose company is developing actual AI rather than Tesla's "is this a person or a tree" algorithms) and laughed at him (along with his fans).

Elon Musk is a prime example of someone who is smart about a few things and because of this, thinks he's smart at everything.

Haha okay NIO bandwagoner. I‚Äôve been on NIO since $4 and said this, and you retards touted the same CCP line back when it went from 4 to 20. Keep cucking
M8 you should buy and hold shares. Play the long and safe game cause you obviously suck at options
all in on NIO calls at open, sorry retards but i've heard enough about this stonk. time to tank it
so which are true, maybe all in your view?

\- tests don't work

\- if we can't figure out how to create a test, we should assume we can't make an vaccine

\- covid19 is just hoax, just a bad flu. just  a bunch of crisis actors around the world in hospitals

Listen you fuck you nissing out on a goat investment opportunity not good get in calls at open
Seems risky TBH
Too many NIO pumpers in here. Stay away retards, they need u to buy in for their calls to print
Great time to buy QQQ calls
I did. Tesla was and is growing in double and triple digit % in multiple verticals at a profit for more than a year. If you recognize full self driving revenue, Tesla has been profitable for longer. No individual company is growing on all the fronts that Tesla is, and this is important because there's synergy between all of the major components (Autonomy, energy storage/solar, insurance, and auto sales).

I am long Nio. It is in bubble, this is a tale as old as markets. Pricing Nio at a market capitalization equal to Google is retarded. They need time to mature.
Slow it down bro sounds like you‚Äôre risking too much each play, nobody is ever successful like that in the long run
It‚Äôs okay if he loses everything you‚Äôll just have to take care of him after he retires
I bought this stock called SEDO around years ago for $3.7/share now it‚Äôs at .04 share (over 90% loss) ... trust me shares can go down even more

i started a position now, dont go too deep, i dont think they will ever fall below 18,9$, but they could go sideways for a year.
anyone looking at NIO??
XPENG pumping again!
Damn I fucked up. I got blasted and stayed up all night, but I have RIDE $17p expiring today. It looks like it'll be up at open, but it could really go either way today. I'm already 70% retarded and gaining 4% incapacity every 10 minutes. I'm liable to be completely delirious by open. Should I close at open or attempt to trade while both completely hammered and also sleep deprived past open? Or should I let fate take the wheel and get exercised as I nap?
[deleted]
Really? 

Colonization is probably the sole reason we live in a world with so many luxuries. 

The natives of North America were not about to invent the car let alone a wheel. Christopher Columbus made it over from Spain in massive sailing ships wearing tailored clothing. 

So I‚Äôd say colonization while brutal at some points has lead to this world and a crazy guy named Elon. 

So judging history by today‚Äôs morals is pretty dumb.
Fack I am a retard
AMZN just give me a good open. I‚Äôm too nervous holding this anymore
Expiry?
I never felt so bad about making this type of return. Feel like the biggest pussy in the world right now. Also sold xpev to a lot at 19 like a month ago.
...and should post in r/smallstreetbets. Ban.
Haha forreal! I spend hours of DD on a stock for it to ultimately plunge. Brand new person buys based on how the ticker is spelled and all of a sudden is Daddy Tendy.
Go buy Nio calls before you miss out
You have 590 and you sold 90? Fucking idiot
My prediction today. We get a small pump this morning and then start selling off the rest of the day. NIO being the exception of course because I don‚Äôt have any.

I need to stop gambling on 0DTE Spy calls. But it looks like I won again so far with the 353C I bought on the dip yesterday.
El yolo es tu
Nio is going to 60 today hop in or miss out
Corsair what the fuck
Right? I mean I go to work and people are talking about moving around their 401k money to different funds and talking about how they're up 6% in one versus 4% in the other. And they're happy about the 6% in a year. No clue what else is out there. You can do better than that even without yolo...just buy Apple stock at any point in the past five years.
even i don't trust myself but whatever, good luck.
Honestly that's a lot of money on the line. I probably would have done the same as you too.

Thinking of selling $65 11/20. 

Will nio reach 65 next week?

I think it‚Äôs gonna crash hard pretty soon
I wouldn't own it right now necessarily either but I bought it beginning of October and its bled since then.

They have posted record losses and have no been profitable in 20 years. They might not be profitable for another 20 years. So holding them 5-7 years seems a bit risky don't you think.
By 2022 surely
best of luck liluglyguy
I give up. I went from $1000 to $5000 then lost 85% on one play. Proceeded to deposit more and almost made my way back to breakeven with more lower risk plays over time and then once again, lost 50% in a day a couple of days ago. Now I‚Äôm at -72% all time and I just feel like I‚Äôm throwing money in the toilet at this point
FSR making some moves finally. Holding the bag since SPAQ is finally going to reward me
50 day sma is the floor usually when it does drop so $35 puts aren‚Äôt a bad way to hedge right now
This is the one
he's literally one of those people who wants everything to reopen.

remember the "arrest me" tweet?
Part of the biggest problem is that its been a slow bleed over MONTHS instead of a quick, hard lockdown with a stimulus to support the lower classes.

Fuck corporations, they can die for not having savings for rainy days.
Advise to sell. Gotta be real with him. I helped someone triple their portfolio this year with draft king warrants. He ended up giving me control of his portfolio and I sell positions quicker than normal now. People are still used to anything besting cd rates as great. Even if all you got him was 10% he‚Äôd be ecstatic
Petition to change the name of this sub to NIO cuck club
I personally think it‚Äôll be around for a long time. Many catalysts and milestones coming. But remember to continually monitor for things that could fall apart and re-evaluate the trade
No buddy it‚Äôs called Nio pump day right to 60
Nio doing what it does best and ripping the day after I buy puts:)
DKNG up, rumors are they will be announcing a new feature that lets you gamble on chinese EV races soon.

RIP PLTR brahs

Your naked calls and puts are getting gaped at open
bruh just long the index moderna might me risky.
Nio:

>You know they say all car companies are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Ford Motor Company and you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another EV company you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a Chinese automotive freak, and I'm not normal! So you got a 25 percent at best at beat me. And then you add Li Auto to the mix? You-the chances of winning drastically go down. See, the 3-Way at Market Open, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning. But I! I got a 66 and two thirds chance of winning, cuz Li Auto KNOOOWS it can't beat me, and it's not even gonna try. So, Ford, you take your thirty three and a third chance minus my twenty five percent chance (if we was to go one on one) and you got an eight and a third chance of winning at Market Open. But then you take my 75 percent chance of winnin' (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 and two thirds‚Ä¶percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning at Market Open! Ford? The numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Market Open!"

Smart money is buying up the daily dips in big tech premarket while retail panic sells during market hours. This has been happening all week.
It‚Äôs at 52 im currently naked in my room licking my wall knowing im balls deep in calls
For a day trade , will it make sense to buy nio 65 c expiring next week?
It spiked AH yesterday, that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs referring to retard
Something something profits never broke .. nah fk it we‚Äôll always feel salty when that happens
And here I am, left with my dick in my hand thinking today would have been a decent entry day for any of the Chinese EV companies üòê
You can look at the NIO 1D chart and almost see the exact minute Trump tweeted. Way before 359. Stop making up fairy tales my good bitch

And be sure to use RKT as your servicer üòé
oh look, TSLA is up 0.42% thats cute
Dunno what you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôll just put my entire saving on moderna
Likely yes.
Classic rkt pump AH just to be flat or negative at open
So you're telling me nio will be a trillion dollar company.. selling evs.. where margins are so thin.
Guh
Hahahahhahaa

Tell him to sell his initial cost basis
You know you (or he) can sell right?
You think that news is gonna matter in a week when everyone forgets about it?
Prudent play!
Imma say it now, not a clue why NIO up this high, but I'm feeling a drop, like fucking hell
tell him to start systematically taking profits
Pffft stop MRNA has never fake pumped...except that one time....shit and that other time...fuck and that other time
Why then ? My plan was start getting puts when market cap is higher than BMW. (What is now). But just no good entry point to get puts. it keeps going up. Seems RSI is at 90 already, but can be like that for some time
I was checking the dictionary for the definition of a retard. The dictionary said:

One who buys NIO even though it doubled in the last 20 days.

üòÇüòÇ
You‚Äôre a moron.
7% is like the average return on a stock in a YEAR.
Yesterday was the dip on Chinese EV retards. +11% is abnormal. Its usually +30%

Market chatter about filing for approvals. Not sure what day it will be but it‚Äôs coming. Makes me nervous to do anything with certain puts aside scalp. May wait until it is announced and, then if it beats up ‚Äústay at home tech tickers‚Äù until I go back into calls on some of them. I‚Äôm not sure it will though the same way the PFE announce did; people realize this isn‚Äôt going away this quarter.
Thanks! It‚Äôs been a good one. I wish everyone here had a few thousand shares. Mine was a small position at the time. I was trying to play it safe. I gotta stop myself from asking- what if I bought X amount lol
When I was a kid my dad said if you‚Äôre not cheating you‚Äôre not trying.  DKNG earnings were distributed yesterday alongside racing tip sheets.
PLTR dead.
If nasdaq can just have a nice fat juicy day that would be really helpful.

Like thick and tight. Real veiny. Shiny and vascular. Want to see rippling going on under the skin. Maybe if it's workout shorts slip down around that thin, muscled waist, catch a quick glimpse of that pubic mound.

Just a strong day in tech would be great is what I'm saying.
Yep. My buddy manages the local lowes and fed me the same info. Business has boomed.
I‚Äôm not joking if fake company gsx can make it to 140+, nio got 150 in the bag in a couple months

Chinese EV is the only thing going up right now.  All the US stonks are channel bound since Sept...
Nio dips under $50 midday then going balls deep.
I was thinking 23, bought some FDs to test my hypothesis... let the short squeeze begin
so what price point for NIo does it translate to? "If NIO dips 30 on RSI"
I don't have play Mond yim down 4k that I have to get back. The one time I bought nio calls was on Tuesday, I bough 48 c expiring today. Then it dipped to 38 and I sold for 100 Dollar loss. Lmao
420.69.  Don‚Äôt sell yourself short.
yolo des ne?
Buying $NIO calls at 9:40 and selling at 10:29
Elon in december: 420 is still 5 times larger than 84

Elon in february: 420 is still 2 times larger than 210

Elon in may: 420 is still as big as 420
I agree but it‚Äôs seemed to lag and move differently ... I was scalping HD for a while, sort of like UPS / FDX movements, theyre correlated but, FDX had better movement, and it‚Äôs less to look at. Also from DD and contractor and anecdotal employee polling I‚Äôve done HD has numbers through the roof due to home improvement service industry work being booked solid since May.

My dad came to me this morning with his portfolio filled with NIO, LI, and XPEV on my advice. He said this is it were rich. I don‚Äôt know how to tell him were in a bubble. I mean I told him to buy those stocks because I thought they‚Äôd reach those prices in 5-10 years. This is insane, and I‚Äôm gonna feel like a dickhead when they all drop.
Damn it‚Äôs dropping hard right now. Good luck.

‚úã
It‚Äôs just very power efficient after that it‚Äôs nothing special.
In the wise words of Fred Durst, "What's done is done, you just leave it alone and don't regret it"
Data has never been more important. They should. E profitable bu next quarter. The losses today were related to entering the market and they will have already doubled earnings by close to 30 percent with the new military contracts they announced
imagine not buying companies that can photoshop their earnings reports with no consequences
Not sure about a pump on this one, Europe + futures should have reacted already and they haven't.
you might want to sell at the open before those become worthless
[deleted]
You would think we would be selling off after even a hint of "lockdown" in the US, but i guess market already knows Biden can't impose that shit till January and by that time the "second, third, fourth" whatever fucking wave we're on will be over..
I locked profit with NIO last week wasnt a great idea :( was up 240% on shares.
i have called a [yuge vaccine pump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtg4dg/i_am_calling_it_yuge_pump_today/) today. literally free money. just do it.

For most it will just stay with virtual money, cause selling is hard. FOMO too strong

NIO 100
I just came back from a quick google search holy FUCK their cars are ugly as SHIT even worse than the local girls here in NZ jacob shriveled up and hid in our ballsacs, also a quick search shows this is a pennystock? Its riding the ev wave but i see a massive dump happening for this...
i mean i assume its moderna vaccine but maybe dix went up because of something else, better buy spy weeklies.
Buy calls when it goes below 78 sell them when it passes 82. Worked for me kinda sometimes i think I should just buy stocks and hold but then i snort sum and nah
Don't think it will but I would be rich if it did.
PSA for All you Autists... EVERY FUKKIN DOLLAR from XPEV, LI and the S&P 500 will Fomo into NIO EOD for ER RUN NEXT WEEK. 

Remember this post. You're Welcome.

NIO $250+ EOM
XPEV AND LI PUMP 40% ON EARNINGS SO NIO DOING 40% TOO. CHINESE EV DON'T KNOW THE WORDS "PRICED IN" MEANS
If we didn't laugh we'd all be insane... Well, MORE insane anyway.

Man do I feel stupid for selling NIO yesterday
It's been a great week for me so I am not going to worry about the drop in bigc. My end up adding more
Deal and you're allowed to buy shares only if you like
ü§°
I'm in NIO and I'm looking at it up over 7% and I feel left out because I'm not yet into LI which is up 30%. How fucking pathetic is it to be sad about a 7% gain IN A DAY?
I made 400% on the run up from 35 to 60 in options. Just re-established a position in stock at $40. The mgmt is shady but the opportunity here is good.
Everyone getting rich with nio while I don't buy it because it has to pullback at some point
Elon only got 50% covid bc of neuralink, robot part of him didn‚Äôt get infected or we would be looking at a skynet spike protein mutation
RKT to 24 today
XPEV and LI killed earnings. If NIO does good all 3 are going to 500
Why didn‚Äôt I go all in on NIO, refinance my house on NIO, take out a 30k loan with 14% APR to buy more NIO üò≠

RemindMe! Tuesday
Whole market sucks dick right now because of fear of lockdown, virus cases, election and blah blah blah. Everyone is jumping on EV stocks because they see everyone making gains. 
 
The volume today will be nuts. And don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôre all a lil nervous.

Buy NIO calls as a hedge
Thought I was a genius for buying 5 more last week. Shouldn‚Äôt made it 50!
If NIO earnings are what we think they are lord knows where this going
Is it a buy right now?
That was a bigly green day unfortunately.
I think it has room to run down to 170. I‚Äôll be looking for another short little rip up this morning and will buy more puts.
Love that diversification strategy!
You are fucking retarded if you buy NIO today üòÖ
Buy any of the Chinese EVs at open? Or wait??
I think if you asked most people in the world if colonialism was good or bad they'd say the latter.
Yup I think 160-170

>News Retards: Trump Banning Chinese Securities with Military Ties

This news was released at like 3:59pm yesterday, and there was no dip in that last 1 minute from this news.

literally no one bought puts on this news. Stop making up fairy tales my good bitch.
NIO just recovered it's big-dick energy bull trend over night (got rejected yesterday).  Still putting in a divergent high if it turns around today, but doubt it will.

I'll be trying to win back losses I took on puts with calls today, if that tells you anything.
I wish my German shit broker would let me buy calls on nio. I‚Äôm up 90% on stocks....
This is very true.
This is a global portfolio. Congratulations
Doubtful. ER is Tuesday and the other tickers all reported good numbers.
Did anyone believe tesla would be at $2000 a share last year? :/
Ahhhh nothing like waking up and realizing you probably lost the rest of your life savings

Today is Friday the 13th. The last Friday the 13th was in March and y'all know how that month turned out. Trade cautiously.
Just like it did last time after ER, dipped for a few days then took off
Yeah, I am expecting for huge ER or something because this week for chinese EV has already been seeing great beats
Someone tell BABA

A share price of $1,000 puts Nio at a trillion dollar market cap. If you believe this is plausible, I want you to see a psychiatrist.
I‚Äôm ready for XPEV to announce a stock split affording everyone lambos
Are you saying that for Speedway or 7-11? I'm probably 200 miles from a 7-11 but 1/4 mile from a Speedway. I love Redbull, but it's so expensive compared to rockstar
COVID has a plan, my friend...
Not sure if i want to just play the moderna news or actually hold for a long term recovery like 2023
Diversified in making profits!
Let's be honest, you were never gonna hold.  You were afraid of losing more.
2.5 weeks ago I bought 1200 shares of Nio and 1100 shares of pltr. This has been the highlight of the year for me.
What price would you place on the moon?
No, earnings already released.

Can‚Äôt wait to see how fucked my baba calls are today!
Today‚Äôs moves: 

Feeling bearish, but MRNA vax news could make markets shake up, less so than the PFE announce (first dances are always the best). 

Shorts: SOLO (clown cars), DNKG (lockdowns and temp profit hype may make it overbought, I‚Äôm bullish long on DKNG, but near term C19 is gonna kneecap it), SPY 0dte if it hits peaks after open, there‚Äôs no catalyst for people to be optimistic over the weekend and Mango is still a wildcard, and doubt a concession. 

Calls: HD (earnings will blow the doors off), TGT (should have an earnings run, have to do more DD), MRNA (maybe, it‚Äôs looking pretty priced in but who knows in this market), maybe CHGG as it‚Äôs oversold and education through Feb-March will likely be remote learning. ZM also for same reason. Specific tech after review of recent charts, if anything is lagging rebound. There will be new restrictions going into Jan-Feb.

I‚Äôm staying away from: BABA (Winnie the Pooh himself has it out for them), NIO (too close to roulette for me today), APPL (not sure what their problem is right now), Cruiselines (old person death ships), and your mom.
Hahahahahahahahaahahahahahaha

Yes I know that part of the business is a shitshow, right now. - But we also just got vaccine news. Maybe I overestimate investors willingness to go longterm on a stock.
I owned it at 2. Lol thought I did well back then selling at 5. Lol
I mean that‚Äôs definitely not true, since 3000 Americans under 35 have died of covid this year and well under 1000 under 35 died of the flu. The flu has 30 million plus cases but only about 30k deaths a year - at that death rate covid would‚Äôve needed to infect nearly the entire USA by now

Take these days as opportunity to build your position. DKNG was mid 60s this summer and minimally gets there next summer. Thats a 50% upside in just equity. A few leaps on DKNG will print for the next year
LI up 30$ PM, XPEV up 10% PM, NIO at 7%. NIO gonna catch up and moon harder soon? heh
A job
[deleted]
Great!  I was down $7k and now only down $2k.  Feels like a win
Think BA is ready to go back up yet or you still short?
Yes
Calls = Up

Puts = Down

All you ever need know
The sad truth is Chinese stocks are only adjusting for dollar inflation from the rampant money printing and earnings are just the catalyst.
1.) it corrected by 15% earlier this week. 45 to 38. People bought it up immediately. 

2.) it has several catalysts coming up *after* ER 

China tensions do got me shook tho.

*jerome powell speaks*, my puts: I can only get so erect
I honestly don't know why someone downvoted me but yea thought I made a mistake but if this holds it could be a nice play indeed.
what positions you had for ba ?
who cares? Covid only kills old people
$LI has some serious bde going on. Fuck.
DKNG,FSR,RDFN,PLTR
My only regret is doubling down on ZM 445 FDs instead of putting that 2k on LI lmao
Can anyone tell one play that can x2 x3 without risk in 2-3 months

Non calls or puts
Surely a positive outcome means that the it will rocket

My little bro‚Äôs private elementary school already made it mandatory grade 1 thru 4 I‚Äôm not even joking

You're diversified AF.

No, I was successful in getting a real job.
Priced in already, the market going numb to global occurrence
Math is hard...
Im being sarcastic
DKNG miss but still going up?
Dollars or cents lmao
china no give fuk about statistics
Probably tank right after earnings.. trend sideways for a week.. then back to üöÄüåô
How is XPEV  LI no upgrade?
I sold 16 p agaist my shares expiring today so if it could stop at 15.99 that would be lovely
[deleted]
I'll be damned if I am gonna sell my leap now. If NIO gets to 100 after earnings, I will very well name all of my future children NIO
The thing is to him, losing 20 pans in high tide and being asked by his boss about it was a funny story. I would've lost my shit and scared to death. The humor of the grunt working class is on another level.

Got a few February calls for that reason.
I‚Äôm not playing NIO with you retards now. I did make a 4 bagger of BA puts yesterday. Those are back on the menu.
Depends on its movement since earnings are this morning. I'm a teacher so I can't stare at my phone all day unfortunately lol and I wanna lock in all the tendies I can üòã
Day trading Chinese EV no problem, investing anywhere past that time frame is well lets say risky. Remember when Covid started in December of last year and China denied it existed? These same people are telling you how well their businesses are doing. Just have your eyes open and dont look long term.
It's already been bought up to become the third largest car maker the world by market cap. 

It probably won't "shoot to Mars" because it's already passed it on its fated cosmic journey.
That‚Äôs that good shit.  All the best bro.
Might be the week after tbh

You guys are chasing the final reversal spike in EVs

Get the app and watch out for specials. They've been having some great sales on Red Bull lately...

WTF.. I think I‚Äôm gonna sit on the sideline of EV rockets for now.. crazier than TSLA split
I‚Äôll take some profits today when NIO hits $55, riding the rest through earnings next week.

We all know NIO will CRUSH earnings expectations, that said, I‚Äôm not that greedy
Are you selling at open or throwing more money at it ?
Try saying that up in Canada in November when winter is approaching , such is life.

Better than taco bell
The trump dip was literally the dip everyone was bitching about getting.
Nah you‚Äôre just an oracle
True.. I just stayed away bc I know nothing about them and figure they might catch the bumps with other EVs
Lol
Another 6% AH wtf 

Every day I think it‚Äôs too late to go all in on NIO and every day I‚Äôm wrong
I‚Äôm on board
China just discovered electricity
Yes sir
That's nuts. I didn't have the balls to do it. I did buy 49 calls midday yesterday that expire today though.
[deleted]
yeah fuck it. I am SO glad I bought a 2022 leap. Even if this shit "crashed" back to like 45, wouldn't even be worried
Thanks for proving my point, as I said no one under 50 dies of Covid.
Gold is money. Everything else is credit.

[It all goes back to 1971.](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)

[The birth of Modern Monetary Theory, Modern Fiat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3szdw/the_birth_of_fiat_currency_neoclassical_economics/)

Sadly, it is much easier analysing history than using it to predict the future!   


BTW, there is a curious anomaly with gold: before it can be ‚Äòmarked to market‚Äô the ‚Äôspot price‚Äô must fall. When I say fall, I mean to what we would today consider near zero. This is ESSENTIAL to flush the paper out of the system. It will happen suddenly, without warning and the ‚Äôprice‚Äô will then soar. Likely there will authoritarian circuit breakers to attempt to quell the stampedes: both out and back in again. Think VW type short squeeze.   


So: do not sell whatever the pain. DO NOT SELL. Be careful the instrument(s) you hold can withstand the above whipsaw.
Lmfaooo fucking same. Sitting here thinking about the yacht I could be buying at opening today
there were air quotes on investing i think
Moderns not pumpin though?
$1k not gonna happen so you're safe. $200 maybe.
sold 35c for a 200% gain yesterday, im not gonna check üò£
Your puts
Bruhhhh check out solo... I‚Äôm in on NIO also. And yea blah blah ugly cars blah blah. But it‚Äôs at 5$ and money to be madeeee. 

Good luck with your dick bro...
The stock relative strength index, another popular indicator use in conjunction with other like MACD it help you understand whether a stock is oversold or over bought so you could make decision on entering a trade or exit out of one.
[deleted]
Yoloed 10k into 50c 1 day yesterday in nio for 70 cents an option. Thank you autismo brothers
I sold 35calls $37 NIO calls for 3.5k now probably worth 38k 3 weeks ago

This dude browses r/teenagers and he ain't even in the market. Positions or ban
more fuel for the fucking retards who think this is a hoax, we're fucked.
I picked up a large 7-eleven Extreme Meat pizza when they had a giveaway recently. It's been in the freezer ever since. Been saving it for a special day. If NIO holds this might be the day.
Hahaha someone doesn‚Äôt have calls or shares, sucks to suck hope u watch it rise all day and cry about it more
My only regret yesterday is that I didn‚Äôt have the freed up cash to buy more puts on them. Their Porsche speedster EV replicas are rad as heck - but everything else is a novelty car here in the USA.
PLUG has retard strength been there all week. GRWG same shit. Oh and they are actually legit companies with real earnings (not Chinese earnings) that will continue to have retard strength for years to come. Wait my bad NIO !!!!!!!! Only NIOüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I don‚Äôt really think you understand the concept or point of a suburb. It‚Äôs to get away from that stuff and have kids, good schools, safety. That‚Äôs pretty much the point - when you want culture drive into the city on some weekend.
Grabbed puts EOD on NIO... pray for me
Why do you miss every pump?
I know, but I‚Äôve had the rug pulled on me so many times I‚Äôm like a beaten dog
I have like 40 yolo 55c exp today, please print

Nio will have a large short term pullback at some point but dammed if im gonna try to time that
I think the person collecting the sample easily could push the sensitivity down from what the test's sensitivity is in a laboratory environment.  Your point stands, Musk is a dumb dumb

We already knew the PCR ‚Äútest‚Äù is utter bullshit and can be dialed up in cycles to produce any amount of positive results the WHO wants. Rapid Antigen might just be too!
Stay away from Chinese pumps n dumps retards!! You can wake up one day to find the company vanished
Wtf is this li thing? Someone tell me
Not it hasn't. Tesla literally had several 20 percent plus days in a row. Most people are just now talking about it.
China pumps their stocks. that's how their markets work. However I don't think Biden eases tariffs on China. He's talked about being tough on china on the campaign trail. 

what he actually does tho is another story.
I was seeing unusually alerts on calls for NIO and LI but puts for SOLO lmao

Ayyy let‚Äôs go - I lived in Boston for like 7 years college and after. My parents restaurant is in southeastern CT. Finally got the lamps but it took like 3 months. And yeah the weather has been nuts.. I was working in shorts and a t shirt with the windows all last weekend it was triply

There‚Äôs nothing more boomer than waxing nostalgic about how something used to be better
surely there's some other chinese EV company trading at 2 bucks somewhere, right? don't have cars yet or something? don't have anything? somehow listed as a family favor? I want in.
Don‚Äôt pay taxes trade in a roth

$200 is a bit high as a dkng bull myself. I've been in since 17 there aren't enough states that have it legalized yet to push it that high unless it pulls a TSLA and utterly abandons fundamentals. We'll see how many states make moves to put it on the next ballot

Well that rapid test results are shit...

Is LI a legit company? Or just a product of the EV pump?
Been flipping ZM calls all week. Can confirm it feels great.
The only way
You probably missed out on NIO and now it is a reminder of that. Sorry for your loss.

DKNG up close to 7% PM before earnings release. 

Totally normal, nothing suspicious here at all.
Yeah. They also recorded the first annual loss in 40 years and cut the January dividend. Disneyland in California is still shut down and with ‚ÄòRona cases rising Florida properties could be in danger now too. Disney+ isn‚Äôt everything.

Those were the secret to financial success

No because it isn‚Äôt an EV pump it‚Äôs a China pump since Biden will lift Trumps tariffs. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs China pumping their own stocks
Good morning.

Give me some plays for today guys...I‚Äôve exhausted my watchlist

Also, what the hell is a vertical?
If NIO doesn't pop more before open I'm all in on FDs
Why u salty?
Also CureVac and Sony have been killing it recently. Happy about that
The question is do I sell my 40c li monthly  or hold that shit
Sounds quite nice. And I totally agree with you on the later part. That‚Äôs well said. I‚Äôve been to Tanzania and it was epic.. was supposed to do a work trip to Indonesia and Vietnam in March but that got fucked. Would love to check our Turkey
NIO call updated but my balance hasn‚Äôt... weird why is it trading

im also thinking big bull trap this morning. gonna wait 1/2 an hour to see what's up and if I can't snag some puts at the top.
True, no one aged 50 or below died or covid. Its a known fact.
Nio always dumps at 945 am right?
Anyone else feel like there should be a major crash but know we gonna pump today anyways?
You son of a bitch
I had a similar view to the company that you do until I listened to the earnings call - the CEO has absolutely no fucking clue about their business. They want to expand into the gaming coaching segment? Wtf is that
I sold the dip on wednesday and feel fucking sick
I lose. Which I am numb to
Seriously. Instead of sowing doubt and not taking it serious, just go the simple humane rout and say I might have Covid, inconclusive so far but I'll try to isolate and not get anyone infected as much as possible. Fuck, it's not hard.
Is NIO the only stock trading this morning?!

This did not age well.......

The fundamentals analysis is sound and price is so low, its a **LONG TERM** bargain. Where else do you get paid near 3% just to own the stock via dividends?   


The thing is, Intel is seemingly also long term doomed by appalling management, internal strife, ‚Äòdiversity & inclusion‚Äô wokeness/madness. No really, it is tragicomical that management seems more interested in being politically correct and ‚Äòsocially responsible‚Äò than profitable. MBAs running the show, not engineers. No insight whatsoever. 

Intel is cannabilising itself.   


Send this to the CEO: [bob.swan@intel.com](mailto:bob.swan@intel.com)
Right now?
The 2000 election was decided by around 500 votes in one state. This election is around a 200,000 vote difference in 5 states. Also going off precedent from 2000, if this WAS a disputed election -it isn‚Äôt- then Biden would still win.

Edit: y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt listen! Bought puts this morning and sold for a measly 30% gain but I‚Äôll take every few hundred I can get!

Of course, but why try to fix something when it's making far too many people far too much money? China NEEDS this after giving everyone the flu this year, so they're willing to throw millions to billions just to keep things looking okay. Only for them to make as much from this themselves, and then short the market while profiting off of that too. Crony capitalism is king, and the people like us are his bitch.

Spoiler: I'm a DIS bull check my history the last couple of days.

I really thought DIS would be 150 today, given that they went up to 144 on vaccine news. 

DIS+ got  73.7 million **paying** subscribers, in a year they added that amount. 

So either DIS should be worth more or netflix is worth to much. Dis added 20M users across their platforms, netflix added 2,2M.  


DIS total 120M  
Netflix total 200M

Dis have a much better business with parks/merchandaise, and added almost 10x as many subsribers.
It's like a certain coffee company's stock didn't implode overnight, and all of a sudden Chinese companies reporting is trustworthy. Can't help but think this is going to end in tears.
It transport a 1000 people and worth more then gm lol
They just got enough data wednesday and it took pfizer like a week to look at the data
Yeah you should stop spreading misinformation
He‚Äôs only the classiest egg. Poached.
No he is definitely a fungus
Earth is flat, buy $NKLA puts because hills don't really exist.
Godspeed to you! I would really recommend reading up more though I‚Äôm just a random autist on wsb LOL. But if you do go with this, just remember to always avoid assignment. Eg if the call you sold is ITM at the end of the week, just roll it out to next week. If it‚Äôs OTM just let it expire worthless!
80*
I‚Äôm silver gang. I‚Äôm a mineral.
It's not though, just like it's not broadly racist or homophobic. Just trolls and people who bite.
Goodness all your downvotes and you said near term!

I agree nio should pull back a bit to consolidate. But it also has slightly dipped each day this whole way up so maybe it doesn‚Äôt need a big consolidation

Long term I think nio is the only one of the 3 big Chinese evs that will win out and will prob buy up the other two if their stocks ever crash
Science needs to find the answer asap
What does it matter... you‚Äôre already guzzling mountain dew and doritos and putting whatever other poisons into your body. Fuck it, load me up with a vaccine. I don‚Äôt give a shit.

Yeah.  So of course the company doesn't  have the right to issue more shares any time it wants and dilute my ownership of it.  Because that would be equivalent to theft right?  Fucking tool.

What is this logic? They can‚Äôt release it until they have statistically significant number of results. It‚Äôs not like they just pick a date

double or nothing i want 1600%
Yeah, I was looking at getting Jan '22 $5C at $10.15 premium and then sell 11/20 $16.5C for -$1.03.

Well that‚Äôs not true. Many people want to be at casinos etc except they aren‚Äôt allowed. Casinos (who do not go by state guideline but separate commissions) have ridiculous rules.

The problem is that avarage uncle Joe believes Facebook posts about tests being a lie and covid a Hoax and then when he has a positive test and flu-like symptoms goes like "it's just the flu!". Doesn't wear a mask, go spread it everywhere till he feels lile shit, finally goes to the hospital and he has 80% oxygen levels and needs a ventilator. 

In this case, Elon's Tweet is exactly what I'd expect from uneducated Karens. People who thinks that knows it all and doesn't trust someone with a fucking degree telling them "you're wrong".

when was the last time we were all looking at statistical rates - never, since this is the first time large non scientific population is looking at this stuff user experience is going to be bad.

 I think this might be a good learning experience for us as a whole. For scientific  community to create a lay man's version of statistics probability metrics that are put out for people to understand, Also for the common person to teach himself some probability and statistics. A lot of other stuff in our day to day life is presented this way and we take them at face value, hopefully this will be a good learning experience. I think we need something similar to the fireside chats by Roosevelt so there is a mass understanding.
Sold my NIO calls for 110% yesterday and feel sick about it
I finally understand how people get wiped out so easily. I literally comment hey wait for a NIO dip to get in. You know like the one we had on Monday. Immediately I get downvoted and then someone tells me it won't ever dip... Jesus Christ. I'm on the China EV train just like all of you retards but at least be realistic

You don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs gonna be a continuation of this pump thru the day?
 My new doctor asked me about my online investing during my phone check-up today. I thought she was interested in hearing about my trading skills which get me money, but then after I spoke for five minutes about it, she said she was concerned that I had a gambling addiction.

He is not denying COVID, just that the tests are any good. Think about this, while they are 85% sensitive, they still have a large percent of false negatives, what do people do when they get negative results? They go around socializing assuring everyone it‚Äôs just a cold, are the tests really helping us here? Add to the problem that the symptoms are all over the place and you have a recipe for disaster. Elon comments is spot on, we have a test problem, perhaps not in the scientific realm but in the day-to-day.

That supreme court ruling did not create precedent because they let the state court decide. The 2000 election came down to 1 state which was within several hundred votes, i.e., the automatic recount limit. This election is not even close to that. Biden is winning by several states, none of which are close enough for a recount except maybe Georgia. 

Also, the supreme court doesn‚Äôt just decide what cases to hear because ‚ÄútHeRe WaS nO rEcOuNt.‚Äù The litigation needs to move past other courts before it even is considered by the supreme court. 

Jeez dude learn some civics.

Shut the fuck up with your idiot conspiracy theories. If we don‚Äôt shut down then the pandemic rages and the economy stays in the shitter regardless of what regulations you have. No one is going to casinos or on cruises and it‚Äôs not because of the big mean government. It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an uncontrolled pandemic with a task force led by a Christian who thinks he can pray away the gay in people and people (customers) are scared. Protecting small business is exactly why the shut down should be paired with stimulus money. Which is exactly what the majority of Americans want but is being blocked by Mitch McConnel, and Trump is playing golf and rage tweeted 100+ times yesterday...about himself. 0 times about the pandemic. I think your uneducated ass meant to post in r/tinfoilhat with your ‚Äúthe gunmint is coming for our small bidnesses!‚Äù bullshit. An uncontrolled pandemic is exactly what will kill small businesses and make the entire world shop at Amazon. You have it exactly bass ackwards. Excellent work.
I‚Äôm not American so I‚Äôm not sure about robinhood. But any proper broker would allow you to do so. I use IBKR. If you do wanna go with what I proposed you would have to put up some margin. Eg if let‚Äôs say you own a long dated dec 2021 20c, if you wanna sell this week‚Äôs 16c, you need to put up $4 in margin (diff between 20 and 16). This way your broker‚Äôs protected from any huge upswing in the underlying eg moving from 15 to 100.

If however you want to avoid margin, you can buy a deep ITM call eg dec 2021 10c. Which effectively acts as stock so you can sell any call above that strike price without any margin. The trade off of course is that the deeper ITM call will cost more
Lol let me guess you don't listen to the actual words or policies coming from your Democrat masters

Wait until like 30 mins after open and see if it dips for a buy-in. If no dip, just buy the option you want

XPEV, NIO and LI are going to make a lot of people filthy rich right now, but leave some hilariously fucked  bagholders once they are done running up when ever that will be, and people realize there never will be just 3 companies selling EVs.
Why?
[removed]
Technically, America didn‚Äôt do any of the Apollo missions to land on the moon by themselves, they just paid a bunch of engineers to do those things for them, lol.
Went from 27-38 yesterday.

Xpev also should get another look
What did u go big on weeklies?üòÇ
Nothing quite like waking up in the morning, scratching your balls, and looking at NIO starting off its moon mission to $60
Ramen with wine... That is what I call fine dining
Not with the pandemic we are in
Yeah, how can Nio have a bigger value than BMW ?
God I hope we don‚Äôt have another lock down.
So far China is giving a lot of benefits for EV owners.  They want to curb pollution obviously.
So PLTR dropped 8% AH after earnings and now is up 2%? Pick a direction why the volatility are earnings that controversial I don't get it
it better be or else my call expiring today will be worhless
True ü§£ü§£
Holy fucking shit congrats! not only on the almost 100,000k but also for having such balls of steel
COD is dead like Madden
Lol try and cry
That is truly staggering. They‚Äôre recommending options!?
Whatever happened to the guy who would water his succulents?

If you were to try to get into NIO now what‚Äôs your play
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt trust this at all. Fuck it go to 380 for all I care. Cash gang better than no cash, or being stuck holding bags for months. This is ridiculous and everyone knows this.
Friend fucking your wife or something?
lol let me guess u think hillary is a satanic pedo too? fucking alex jones worshiper gtfo

edit: not gonna lie i am just posing as a leftie lol just wanted to see what it feels like to sound like an AI bot for the left.
Depends on how much Biden fattens them up.
Dunkin made me good coffee this morning. Good job Dunkin employees
Already declared bankruptcy once. I'll pass
Looks like I missed it, hate buying shit that's already ran up that much
At this point r/investing is recommending NIO calls....just sayin...
Honestly that would be the flip of the century. I‚Äôd be mindblown
You think Li will rise just as much as NIO? Might split what I‚Äôve got into both.
then best of luck to you. godspeed.

They‚Äôre already dying, how much more can they die more.
America time
The fact that stats knowledge is needed to understand if you are COVID positive is broken, it speaks to the lack of touch from the scientific community communicating with average people. To average people, this testing system feels broken. Your explanation is pretty good, but unfortunately, the scientific community is shielding behind sensitivity rates when speaking and letting the public interpret them, that‚Äôs not gonna get us very far.
Yeah, Sold Nio at 15$ after Buying for 10$. It's still in the Green...
That would be some rabbit üê∞
Brad pitts
Seems like a cash out
Ok I don‚Äôt want to spam this place but I‚Äôll lay it out in a way you retards will understand.

Buy $FSR, it like $NIO but American. Soon üöÄ
But if you had caught the Tesla hype at peak WSB mentions you would have bought puts at 500

The bitch is calling the top too early üôã
Gonna have a bad time.

Cruises always pump in retard fashion. For months there every time CCL touched 13.50-13.80 EOD, you knew it was going up 3-7% the next day.

That's the number I was waiting for to make some more free money, but 14.80 might be the new # with the vaccine news.
This is why I love capitalism. Let's retire a bit earlier than planned boys....let's goooo
If mango can pull a rabbit out of his ass and win then I bet all China stonks die

"For the three months to the end of September, Palantir‚Äôs revenue climbed 52 per cent, to $289.4m. It reported a net loss of $861m, or 94 cents a share, $847m of which was due to employee stock expenses following its direct listing in September.

Adjusting for the compensation costs and charges associated with the listing, it reported a profit of $73m, or about 8 cents a share, compared to a loss of $92m the year before. Wall Street had been expecting adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents, with revenue of $279m."

Good thing I sold options

I have a feeling Li will do the same thing Xpev did yesterday, especially now that everyones so inspired to do so from yesterday.
Sell and change to $60, was holding $15 same date just to look at the percent gain go to the moon but missing out on more potential tendies

My boy spy is about to catch a fade
I got in SOLO at 2.9 with leaps and shares (sadly way too little), ill be holding till $8 or 9 at least probably. Easily doable with their market cap, it wont be a $20b hype company, but it's not gonna crash to oblivion with their current market strategy and just starting their product line, together with earnings beaten.

I dont think its a complete buy and forget stock, should try to monitor closely how they will perform selling stuff early 21

What kind of egg are you? Hard boiled, scrambled, chicken, fish?
Well first of all, no one seems to know when Biden is actually President-Elect (hint, it‚Äôs December 14) and similar to The 2000 Bush and Gore incident I have no doubt that before then the already Democrat and Republican Congresspeople will agree to a recount, if not then there is no doubt it will move up to the Supreme Court, which btw has already made it precedent that ruling in favor of a recount on the case of a presidential election is all fair, given the month-long series of legal battles which led to the 5‚Äì4 Supreme Court decision Bush v. Gore, which ended the recount. Ultimately leading to Bush‚Äôs victory.
So you are the only person in wsb to not buy NIO?

The American dream is now made in China. You don‚Äôt buy the batteries on these cars like you do on Tesla‚Äôs, you rent them. And they take 5 minutes to change out instead of two hours, they are always backed hardcore by the government and they‚Äôre expanding into Denmark and Europe now. How many people buy Honda or Toyota ? Millions, because those engines run forever. China has the biggest vehicle market in the world, as petrol cars get phased out EV will take over, NIO is the Mercedes of EV over in China, it‚Äôs like having a Tesla over here.

It, along with the other big chinese ev‚Äôs, is being heavily supported by the chinese government amd will continue to be supported by the chinese government for the foreseeable future considering its a growing market that china can get into and because china has a very serious air pollution problem that it needs to work on rn (which its doing by pushing ev‚Äôs). NIO is now alongside Tesla in in technical capabilities via the self driving. Furthermore, china has shown thats its fully capable of penetrating markets across the globe, especially american markets, due to its manufacturing capabilities and its ability to keep its exports cheap

I bet you‚Äôre all wondering why I‚Äôve called you here today
Today?
Let‚Äôs be real... the reason the market rallied last week was not because of a Joe Biden victory, but because of a Mitch McConnell victory in the senate.  A blue wave and Biden victory were totally expected, so there‚Äôs no way the market would rally on an expected Biden win; the market rallied because this blue wave didn‚Äôt happen and therefore MM is gonna be top dog in the senate.

This. These tests have false negatives but rarely false positives. Someone who doesn‚Äôt have it would test four times with no positives. Someone who does will test four times with some positives.
I know it's never a good idea to hold through earnings but damn it's frustrating to see it moon after the fact. See FTCH
What you can do if you think it‚Äôs gonna soar but have a small account is to buy LEAPS and concurrently sell weekly calls. Let‚Äôs say you have faith in PLTR hitting 30ish next year you can buy a 2021 dec call with strike of 30. And every week sell weeklies of say maybe for this week sell a call with 17 strike price? That way you benefit both from the stock movement and some premiums along the way.

As long as they can remain the king, avoid huge setbacks like BA and their 737 max, and continue to advance their battery technology they'll hit 1-2T market cap eventually. Very speculative though.

Record numbers... they have sold around 20000 vehicles.. my irish nan sold more tractors than that to the gypsies in the 60's. 

I agree there is potential, but thats it. 

Also, dont forget. The chinese companies can lie about revenue and sales to foreigners and it is not a crime!!!!!!! 
Be cautious - make money
PLTR boomer long term hold gay bull gang checking in. GME gang bent me over hard, but so far (last 24 hours) PLTR gang is welcoming me with open arms and tendies.

Holding this shit till $100 a share or until next gang train convinces me otherwise (aka holding for either a week or years)
Always hedge with NIO

My NIO calls gonna save my dumb ass for buying puts yesterday
No. You are.  Tesla has been selling cars for the last decade
Get a load of smooth brain over here.
Damn no kidding all people comment about is nio these days
Yes, yes, just a little farther(further?), DKNG...
NIO already up to 51 PM. Boy, it would be super bad if anyone currently was a bear about the Chinese market being a bubble. Like me.
Illusion. Just ignore it.

NIO is supposed to be the best performing out of all 3 EVs I think, so everything is I guess running up cuz the other EVs have reported great earnings. As long as NIO can come thru and deliver, I expect this squeeze to continue

Guess I'm fair weather gold gang but I know an overreaction when I see one. I'm bullish back up to perhaps $1,920, but I'm monitoring the gold situation closely. I'm good at fundamentals but awful at general perception. I see the obvious retracement from the vaccine news but there's obviously going to be a second vaccine news rally, but I'm god awful at trying to figure out if gold will retrace back to $1,900 before the next good news re-rotates everything again.

Good enough for me.  All in.
chances of $NIO hitting 60 by earnings ?
 The first thing they teach you in basic investing course is to buy NIO calls
Going to feel that one out today while at work. Then get done just in time for power hour and decision making process begins.
FSR tho
I really wonder if Tesla‚Äôs rocket ship days are behind it.  I think it will still do well as an industry leader but the entire car industry and a myriad of startups are all getting into the EV space now.
you've never seen huge price movements at 925 going into 930? and really its about a $2 price move, for NIO that's a blink of an eye

it was a hypothetical. apparently you have no plan if that happens.
your webcam
I just sold... maybe i bottled it. Maybe i was too much of a pussy to hold my gains. 

Time will tell. Being realistic, i think where it is at now it shouldnt go any higher. They have potential, but thats all it is. It makes no sense to keep climbing until further news comes out.

That doesnt change my point, the pandemic will get even worse from this point while investors think its going to end soon. Tldr: short oil
nah, i dont play meme stocks.

might lose out on some braindead gains in the short term, but makes you a far more profitable trader longterm. 

One of these days NIO is gonna drop 15-30% overnight, and it will literally bankrupt half this sub.

not even close. The max pain points for 11/13/20 are :

This. The only reason for the boom was a positive earnings report. NIO has been positive the past 3-4 earnings. I think at this point the best indicator to judge NIO's growth is to compare it to other Chinese EV stocks and not compare it to your normal American blue chip stocks like Apple for example.
I'm sure there's at least one guy in your town that will pay for it

I bought at $2.50 sold at $7 imagine how I feel, oh well I secured my profits.

I'm thinking $55C 11/20 or $60C 11/27

Hey just wanted to say one of your pro-gold comments you made earlier this week tipped the scales on me going in and making about a 20% return on GLD calls the past 3 days. Gotta give credit where it's due. I'm out now but I'm still closely monitoring the sector lol.

It only has so much steam. It corrected hard on Monday. I can see a -10-15% swing at some point next week. Maybe it will last a day past earnings, but it will happen. Just don't get IV crushed
If you‚Äôre on this sub and sexism is the most important thing that is worrying you then you‚Äôre obviously not fucking trading.

amzn didnt really move since july. i hope you have stocks and not options. just wait for the quants/risk parity to get in the game when vol is low enough again.
 What do you think of 330c 04/16/21? Might get 50 of those at open tomorrow.
WHY DIDNT I HOLD ONTO MY LI CALLS WTF MY DELICATE PAPER HANDS üìÑüñê

Fuck that bro if the dogs got a problem they should be able to settle that shit like men
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt think women can trade. I‚Äôve been playing fantasy football for 7 year, put multiple hours a week into research, etc. This girl I‚Äôm talking to just started playing this year and chooses players by ‚Äúhow hot they are.‚Äù She has a better record in her league than I do in mine. When these people are up, they act like it‚Äôs cause they‚Äôre smart or some shit and not just retardedly gambling like the rest of us
Every not so retarded autist wsber, yes.

We are 15% hedged in puts or more
Ofc I wish him well but it would be the best thing that could happen to tesla's shareholders. Having the myth of this famous guy as their founder, without him actually doing stupid shit every 24 hours.

Wait you said -15% yday. Im willing to bet any amount that tomorrow we aint getting -10%.
No, he doesn't.

Massive bull trap for anyone buying 1. Weed stocks 2. Stonks impacted by corona. Nice fade of that obscure pop on rona pump by physer
Thoughts on CCL today? Even with a seemingly strong green start anyone else think this will dump more today? They found covid on passengers on the first cruise ship back to the Caribbean, they closed at 14.93 yesterday which is a little over a dollar more than it closed last week and to me doesn‚Äôt have a great outlook with covid numbers spiking, lockdown talks and tech ripping. It is trading in premature at 15.50ish about 4 percent higher than close yesterday. I have puts I got yesterday, maybe I should cash out at open? Break even is 14.92
I mean, you can just sell to make a spread (one ticker out) thats what I did to ‚Äúday trade‚Äù some puts
this is the he-man woman hater‚Äôs club
AMD, new consoles with AMD CPU, Gaming during pandemic is HOT. New GPU, Lisa fucking Su, huge support at $78, Even post Covid 19 corporate offices love buying AMD hardware for company desktops, cheap and powerful!
And ‚ÄòCors‚Äô is like ‚Äòof course‚Äô - will you buy the stock? Of Course!
Thanks dude! Looks good this AM. I should‚Äôve held onto 1 more call but like you said I made money already so the rest is fun.
They can go to 1 trillion market cap easily.
I googled it and i get some weird results.
Size matters !   Somethings a 20 year old hasn‚Äôt quite learned yet !!
What's the big deal bout losing shares? You can just buy more if they get called away, assuming you have the cash.
You wouldn't have bought it, when they were under $2 they were at risk of bankruptcy, the orange was berating China, Luckin Coffee just got delisted, and you would have had the whole sub calling you a retard for touching it.
haha üòê
u dont think theres gonna be another feedback loop next thurs? imagine when nio surpasses earnings, like they did the past 3-4 times. thats just gonna give another boom to LI and XPEV
I'm just saying, if someone here has a plan, my schedule's very free
If NIO opens red. Will you buy or sell? Might want to have that conversation with yourself now so you are ready.

I am morbidly curious what would happen to this sub if it hits its MaxPain point of 39. 

Be honest, could you financially recover from it?
It‚Äôs emitting light. Should I go to the doctor?

If you don't have NIO , LI, or XPEV in your portfolio you're just gambling.
Yes but nothing to write home about
This is why you buy 11/20 or 11/27 calls at EOD today and then Jan 15 calls a little after earnings to see if there's a correction

This sub is sexist as fuck

Never heard that but ok boss
wtf AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NQ is ripping higher and you decide to just sit there
Did you make money?
Today
That is trade republic ( german broker)
its climate change dumbass
Today if you like money
;)
It's almost double the 50-day rolling average. Up 2500% this year...Idk man, the 3 EV stocks have been a feedback loop off of each other's earnings and general hype but it has to pull back hard soon. It will run back up by January because they have NIO Day on the 9th. I'll probably buy a few weeklies for the earnings hype/dump but then I'm buying shares and picking up OTM Jan 15 calls
Cry and use your tears as lube.

And then buy back in on the dip. I sold 1000 shares at $4 along with some 11/20 and 11/27 calls that are heavy ITM. I bought back in at $46, so fuck my fucking life.
Does the company have major issues or why is the stock so (comparatively) cheap?
Now I know you guys are excited about the EV train today, I know I am, but today is Friday, ya cant exclude the fact that there might be a selloff for those that dont want to hold over the weekend.
I'm saying the same. It might crash from here. When the market open, it's a 50/50 chance green or red. Man let it be red haha asking for a friend.
And the ceiling
-10% tmrw
But how???? How is this possible??
It's only a problem if you didn't buy into it
Please shut up
I want to buy more NIO! Should I buy today or on Monday ?

Haha yep. You do not want to be a bag holder with this stock, just for the sheer embarrassment of what they actually sell.
heres my NIO prediction: 55 by Earnings, dip to 48 at lowest. Then moons back up from there. you might as well buy at 50 right now if you arent a brainlet.. NIO has been doing this pattern all month

also, i am being very conservative. with this boom so far from yesterday and this premarket dont be surprised if its 60 at Earnings at this rate.. then the dip would be low 50's at best...
But guys, is it still interessting to buy it now at this price ?
Happy Cake Day coastalsfc! The only dare you ever want to take is the dare to be all that you can be.
I have 10 Amzn 3200c 11/13 should I wait for 15 mins after open and sell?

Bruh go clean that shit up
what happened to jack
JPOW‚Äôs powerless at this point without congress ordering more stimulus OR going negative on rates OR banks suddenly deciding that unemployed people are fantastic credit risks and giving more loans out which they aren‚Äôt doing OR the world creating a new financial system of cashless dystopian society run by bureautechnocrats like Klaus Dr Evil Schwab at World Exonomic Forum.

When rates were 8 or 6 or 5%, sure the Fed could kickstart the economy by juicing rates lower.  But now they are at 0. 

Which is why every day on CNBC you see another Fed president or lackey trotting out there begging for more stimulus, basically saying we‚Äôve done what we can monetarily but pls pls pls we need more govt fiscal stimulus
Do u think there‚Äôs any chance of NIO hitting $65 by next Friday? I wanna sell some covered calls but don‚Äôt wanna lose my shares
Yeah, but there's one thing that matters most for Americans besides money and that's convenience.

Yes there‚Äôs tons more going on there. My current beach town is sleepy
My plan for NIO. If we open green I'm selling my $50C at $50-51 depending on support/resistance then waiting for a dip below $50 to buy $55C or $60C 11/20 depending on how ballsy you're feeling. Higher strike more likely to get IV crushed but also higher returns if it keeps mooning before earnings next week. Diamond hands but don't be greedy, boys

Usually, a ticker gets imminent death once it's get spammed at a certain rate per 10 comments. But not with NIO and the gang. That's how retardedly strong Chinese EVs are. 

NIO $69.42 EOY
Honestly with the feel of this week, today might be one hell of a slump.

However, as proven on multiple occasions, it‚Äôs going to touch green midday.
Unfamiliar with the other assets mentioned. Physical gold and silver is one way of investing as well, but less liquid than shares/derivatives (but riskier). All about trade offs it seems.
I‚Äôve been counting down the days pay attention

Ooos sorry
What app are you using?
We laub peelep Ribers poreber!!!
Most my portfolio is in NIO, but regardless, fuck the CCP.
I have a friend who works there. They‚Äôve signed on a massive customer, even bigger than tiktok. I won‚Äôt say here but they‚Äôre in the fintech industry. FSLY back to 130 real soon. Holding shares and calls.
thats the problem
i can feel the weakness in me today. i trimmed my NIO position. Need to rub one out.
what's the expiry?
Post lock down and post stimmy the MMs will let it break ATH and make its run for $400+ in mid 2021 :)
And yet everyone knows what he is talking about
And the one before
cool story bro...  I‚Äôm going back to sleep with your gf
Why isn't there a WSB podcast?
I think I might cash in at open. Feels risky to hold on longer
From what I‚Äôve seen from both parties in the last 12 months, I think I‚Äôm just gonna try to make money for a while
Sounds like he just has early stages of covid or another flu that has similar signs.
You mean the same LIN that's at $256 right now?
In any case, given the shitty false negative rates of these rapid tests, he probably does have covid. Also you have to consider bayesian analysis of the tests. What is the probability that a covid negative person would test positive twice/negative twice? Pretty unlikely.
No DD, no sources, no positions.  Thought there were rules here
nah nah nah nah

i know all of you retards have piled into NIO, but you are not allowed to just say "it" like NIO is the default WSB stock
it just needs to break above 267-268 then it should get going
Channel your inner NIO and rise up 


Or DM me dawg let‚Äôs talk
I sold my $45C for this Friday (got in at $42 during first pull back to $39) when we closed at $43 Wednesday. I realistically would have sold at $45 or 46 but I definitely wouldn't have held til now at $50. I did open a few $50C during today's dip but I would have opened a lot more had I not sold my weeklies for a loss. Still made a killing on NIO though and I plan to get in on the run tomorrow/Monday.
Ohhh baby you sound salty, t and p

This is not financial advice, do your own due diligence.
even if its a 5% gain thats still good. after a 30% boom and 20% boom pre market u dont think it will grow at least 5% today?

I normally dont buy the VERY top

But i buy like a day before the very top and end up bagholding. I was planning on holding chinese EV another week so do w this info what u will
what is BABA actually doing, tech ripping and its sitting there at 0.40%
I‚Äôve said this a few times about Sony but I think it‚Äôs worth saying it again. If you wanted to get in on the console release pump you‚Äôre about 6 months too late. I bought Sony over six months ago for this very reason. You‚Äôre late to the party I‚Äôm afraid.


As far as GME... I‚Äôve considered buying either long term calls or puts several times but ultimately decided to stay on the sidelines on this one.
They may be a good broker dealer, but personally, im not a fan of their trading resources.

Agreed, just not here.

Take profits as soon as there's sign of a pull back, then get back in for slightly above ATH if there's a dip with some of what you made.

Thank you kind stranger. Only one correction. I‚Äôm not an autist. Those are actually smart in their unique ways.
I was profitable but no one couldve predicted that move. We immiedately gapped down Monday. October 12th til election $SPY was in the gutter. Noone holding calls was profitable during those -$15 days

Some people, man they are wired differently. There are some who have a base camp they can default back to, and there are some that no matter what they push for more no matter the opportunity cost. My life situation is neither; I'm working to build the base camp. After that I don't know how I'll act. One thing I love about this place is you get all walks of life in all the stages of development and levels of wealth and greed, but you see the plays, but not necessarily the stage of life and capitalization behind them unless you dig. I'm currently 30 years old and toward the lower end of the totem pole. I love seeing the slices of life, the goals and ambitions, and what people are willing to sacrifice to move ahead, even if mine are comparitively conservative.

I am so depressed, I wish everybody else was dead!

1 week.
I believe the reason NIO will keep going up until it hits around $150 is because retail investors, young investors with $200 in their Robinhood accounts, can keep getting in. NIO is really cheap and appears really appealing to young investors. Everyone sees this as the "Tesla" of China & everyone knows how Tesla turned out...

Keep in mind this post is coming from a brand new account...
We'll see, if they can consistently building non-mattress portfolio while still maintain the excellent performance of the core product, we can see similar or bigger growth than this year (50%) on next year.

But yeah, I admit, that is too optimistic.

How did LI do on earnings compared to estimates?
profit is profit, no?
And spxl only up 3.75% from 1 year ago, uvxy down 18%?
LI earnings are nothing to laugh at, holy shit. They turned a a non-gaap profit this quarter, from being down 159m RMB in Q2. Insanely good imo
Wait till 8AM
Is the market going to sell off at open, like quicksand?
Unity makes me a bit sad lately
Who else is buying way otm 0dte on chinese EV tm
Markets will hedge in order to meet liquidity demands.

This is why earnings make no sense sometimes.
Dont worry young autie, the first ones free. You see, options contracts are like insurance. Big bois use them to guarentee a certain return regardless of the circumstances of the market. We use them to gamble.

So, when big bois are buying lots of puts, its a sign that they expect success, but are prepared for the worst. This place has skewed that data noticebly, so dont bother trying to use p/c ratio as an indicator. It doesnt help.
BABA to 280 today plz
just buy every NIO dip bois, this stock will keeps raising till earning and explode bigger  after with no limit

Last friday NIO mooned AH and premarket, and then dropped a few dollars by EOD close. Nervousness.
i was into solo but it seems nobody in usa will buy them. they don't have product market fit although their product looks/is interesting
Can someone with a functioning brain tell me what is supposed to happen when there are a lot more puts than calls for a company? 

Or show me a nice link that explains it to retards? 

Im finding it hard to understand.
Glad i bought $SPY and AAPL calls in September instead of the fucking Chinese EVs on my watch list. Fuck. Sold all my nio too back in July
what terrible play
Dont forget KNDI guys... up big premarket. One more for Chinese EV stocks.
Bought some 12/18 10c today, I hope it moons

I have done theta gang a few times and made some decent money there but if you have enough capital there are some obvious plays that will make money. I have traveled most of my life been to about 30 countries and all of america. i enjoyed the experiences and still want to travel but i dont have that same sense of adventure i had a few years ago. i dont know why.

I don't ever need more than $75k/yr. That's why hearing about your windfall and proceeding plan when putting it on a course to make $70k/wk essentially risk-free hit a nerve with me, especially when you have the capacity to continue to generate income hit a nerve with me. And also the high emotion day and booze, but we aren't talking about that haha. But I'm just a dude. I'm open to any advice you can give me too. I'm thinking of continuing to work to expand the passive income and either make more or make the same with less risk. My dream would be to tour America and beyond while making money passively. I don't need the material wealth many desire. I crave experience.
This might be my ticket to retirement

Yesterday, CNBC (and reportedly Fauci) was saying that the data analysis is expected in a matter of days to a week. They have accrued the case number required for Interim Analysis #1, and now it's a matter of analyzing it.

Bancel (and even Fauci, actually) are known for overpromising on timelines, though. I would say the optimistic case for data release is next week, and the slightly more conservative case is the week after.

What are you playing?

.13 USD is correct, but for every share of BABA in USD you actually own 8. 8:1 Ratio.

HK Price x .13 x 8 will get you close to the USD price.
Honestly I probably won‚Äôt even get the chance to. It‚Äôll be a dip after a massive pump. No time for IV to die. Even if they‚Äôre hedging for 50, that shit don‚Äôt belong there rn. Run up too big

Put down $21000 im at $25500 now. I started with like 10k 2 months ago. Not bad for a newbie ehh? I rode Nio and then xpeng yesterday and them Li today. Not to brag but i hit every turn perfectly pretty much. I'm going to start getting into options now as well.

Yes. It means that if you were to buy this option now it would cost you 1990. Its because the price moved towards your strike price.

There's nothing bogus about getting 2 positives and 2 negatives. The BD rapid test has an 84% sensitivity, but a 100% specificity. So the test might miss a detection, but it won't give out false positives. If you test positive at all, you probably have covid.
My NIO 32 calls expired worthless 2 weeks ago
Elon will outcompete covid for sure. Tesla is way more exponential.

Be better. Fuck. Just do it. Your share price will even do better if you see big picture. Jesus is not fucking hard. I know you see it. Be brave.

These tests have a high specificity, which means that if you test positive at all, you probably have covid. Sensitivity, on the other hand can be lower, depending on how the test is done, so if you actually have covid, you might still test negative.

The only way I've heard of people getting false positives (test positive when you don't have covid) is if they were getting better from covid and they test negative, but then test positive again, due to still having some dead viral particles in their system.
It‚Äôs almost like we don‚Äôt have a complete grasp of how the virus infects, transmits or can be successfully tested let alone vaccinated. Fucking idiot.

So it's decided. The market doesn't care about anything bad happening in the world that would adversely effect the economy as a whole or profits the companies make. What only matters is uncertainty and panicking... I think the market as a whole is totally healthy and shouldn't be questioned for a single second.
Well that XPEV put was the wrong move lol
Do you have a problem with futures and a picture that is literally from this (Monday 5 days ago) that shows the profit when you hold futures through 2 months? 

I'm honored to know it bothers you so much that you think I work for a brokerage I don't even use or know anything about? I use TD Ameritrade by the way and do you not want to let WSB know about the 50x leverage on futures or something?

What is the problem? Is WSB about leverage and big bets??

God I feel so bad for you completely moronic bears. It‚Äôs cringe watching the futures melt up and seeing these salty OMG I GUESS THE METRICS DON‚ÄôT MATTER ANYMORE!!! Like. No shit. Rates are at all time lows. People aren‚Äôt selling off because the people who own stocks have no reason to sell off. Where the fuck would the money go? Sit in a 0.5% yield bank account? Get 2% on a bond? The fuck? The market is the only viable investment vehicle and KNOWN dangers like a potential shutdown (in the face of a looming vaccine) or high valuations aren‚Äôt going to change that. The sooner you idiots understand that, the sooner you‚Äôll stop bleeding money and actually make GOOD autistic yolos.
Seriously though. Good news related to COVID19 (Vaccine news) brought down Nasdaq down 350$ in a matter of minutes (remember we were mooning to 12500 almost premarket)

If you're assuming it's gonna be 200 by 2023, IMO you should sell your ITM leaps and just buy the furthest OTM leaps you can. You're prepared to take the risk because you are already thinking it's gonna shoot up anyway!
1)Don‚Äôt listen to anyone on this sub.       
2) Wait until you learn how rotations and swings work before you get into options.        
3) if you‚Äôre going to sell an option, selling at open can be the most profitable when you hit major swings even if it goes up .50 from open just because of volatility.        
4) Dont listen to anyone on this sub and only buy stock when buying shares on hype stock because in most cases you can buy 10 shares for 1/2 the risk, but endless time limit when compared to weeklies or you can buy 33 shares compared to highly volatile monthlies. Always consider risk reward.       
5) always set an expectation that you expect a stock to meet by a certain time and undershoot that price by 10%. If it isn‚Äôt slightly itm with 40% IV or less it‚Äôs not worth buying(sure you can win but there are always better charts to buy in on).        
Options are for day trading and hedging against yourself, not for long positions unless it is a dirt cheap position(look at all the idiots who were panicking over Apple but have since calmed down) always try to pull profits at +100% and keep a little bit in the game as ‚Äúhouse money.‚Äù Sometimes you will regret not leaving it all in, but when you sell out at the right time you will feel justified in your sell out, and you can always trickle sell your options as it becomes more and more profitable.          
6) for some reason options are cheapest(based on IV and gap in ITM options to price) around 1:30ET and 2:30 ET.
Think of it this way, at least you made money so now you can take that girl you been seeing, who KINDA technically is your cousin but she's from the part of the family no one ever talks about so it's cool, to an all inclusive dinner at Wendy's.

Started w 1m. The chart is since inception. 

Well. When you are down right from the start u don‚Äôt think about wins as gains. Just trying to claw out of a deep hole. 

The recovery this year came about by watching the Chinese markets during covid. I saw how serious it was over there, how the market tanked and then recovered via government intervention. US markets was late by a month to react. So just shorted the hell out of it, wait for it to happen and flip back long at the lows. Easiest trade in my life since it was an exact repeat of the Chinese markets. 

I don‚Äôt usually remember my gains, only my losses. My biggest loss is when I dropped 4m in a trade in a different trading account by taking on massive leverage and rolling unrealized gains into bigger and bigger positions. Granted most of that is unrealized profits. That was during the run up and bust of the Chinese equity markets in 2015 (go check out the chart). I have since closed that account. 

Older and unemployed now so punting a bit more ‚Äúconservatively‚Äù.

Higher risk higher reward
Not to be THAT guy, but it was not overvalued until now. We were waiting for a huge gap up with strong close. 

If it opens red today, it's a go for a short. Typical behavior. It will not go to -99% obviously but 30-80% loss in 5 days would be normal.
It‚Äôs possible that we are in a completely fraudulent market.
Lazy DD.
I don't think it'll drop that low after earnings but I can see in the mid-high 30s if it passes $50 before ER or low $40s if we have a pull back to $45 and maintain that going into Tuesday.
Given the uncertainty, if you‚Äôre at a decent gain. Gotta pull them out.

Can‚Äôt risk it over the weekend with gains at stake
Tip #1: Read the posting rules.

If I have NIO $40 2023 leaps, is it better to roll them out to $50 or higher leaps?  Or just hold my $40 leaps?  What wwill make me more money, my assumption being they will be $200 by 2023.
Maybe that's what I'm doing wrong.. down is up in 2020
dix still under 45 

thats not bullish at all
Calls or stocks?
Thank you for the chuckle at the irony of your comment.
ye they'll proly hit $200 next year

i guess they just fired half their employees to keep earnings stable
now just wait, wait and wait it out until spy takes its little shits then buy calls a month out at least and ride, poop waves up.. that's what i would do
No, I didn‚Äôt want to wake him from nap time.
Forgot to say yeah I'm selling weeklies right now. Since I'm doing it with immediate weekly income in mind, I'm not at the point of having actual investment savings in mind, but once I am at the point I can invest with capital that is separate from the direct income, I would be buying shares, LEAPS and selling covered calls against the LEAPS.

After years of equity, futures, and leap options trading, I've finally devolved enough to enter a YOLO -

 Heineken put @90 expiring next Friday.
They 100% could solve ALL of our economic pain but they choose not to. It‚Äôs totally possible to eliminate like 90% of Americas pain but our politicians are paid a shit ton of money to not change the system (which would hurt their profits). So our elected leaders do NOTHING. we did basically zero compared to any European country, look at Europe. In Germany, they guarunteed all wages and no one got fired. We just gave 4+ trillion to large corporations but can‚Äôt spend alittle on the people? 

What do you mean ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the gov can give any more unemployment?‚Äù

Media services is most their revenue now. They have over a third of Netflix customers in less than a year. Mind you last earnings was dog shit abysmal and the stock price went up 10 bucks the next day.

I think the forward guidance is that once the pandemic is over, Disney will probably be worth alot more. Cooked books or not, this virus should've decimated a company like Disney. But here they are. I know, nothing makes sense this year. Why I got calls. I'll still probably lose.

Beautiful 2020 in a nutshell
The number of retards around here that think they‚Äôre called ‚Äústocks‚Äù and not shares blows my dining mind. You even wrote ‚Äú/share‚Äù when you gave the price. You want to know why it‚Äôs called price per share?
if you use Business Insider, they have a live recurring market update from other markets. 

For example, if I wanna see NIO's price is doing across all market schemes, it'll show the updated version of the converted global market average in USD. At least that's my understanding.

Done to death /sarc off
I'm in Southwest Ohio. I've been poor all my life, and last year I made $17/hr, but this year I got a raise to $20/hr, but I got "permanently furloughed" from my job earlier this year. I am a lower earning demographic compared to the rest of this sub, but just this year I've finally been able to become completely debt-free and allow my capital to start doing some work for me whereas all my life I've been making sub-$14/hr. The idea of making $50,000/yr off of passive income and any further work enhancing the passive earning potential sounds like salvation to me. I'd love to simply pursue my hobbies without the grind of a dayjob taking the majority of the day. I know that's a different goal than most here, but saving money to more securely enable maximum free time is my goal and I get passionate at the thought of others breaking free from the American grind. Lol thanks for listening.

Easy. 

I'm just pissed they only gained 5% this is a joke. That stock should atleast be 150.  
They added fucking 20M paid subscribers. Netflix have 200M TOTAL. So since Disney have a much better business model than Netflix, they should atleast gain 20-30B in value by that move alone.

I have a real life friend that turned 1m to 200-300m punting on the markets. He did this by continuously doubling down with his unrealized profits for a few months. 

7 years later, this past month, I just heard from another acquaintance that he lost most of his fortune. 

Still, during that time he was rolling in Bentleys, picking up C list actresses and models... Living the life.

First off my plans don't necessarily have to be your plans. I'd like to think of it more as a fallback plan. A baseline. If I could be a total bum and still make $50,000/yr doing nothing, that would be perfectly fine for me. That means I could pursue whatever I wanted and if that didn't work out, oh boo hoo I still make $50,000/yr! It's like a base camp I could retreat to. For my personal goals I'd still only actually consume about $30,000/yr of the $50,000 income, so I'd still be saving $10-15,000/yr which would either feed the passive income or be consumed pursuing other entrepreneurial goals. For you, if you really made like $150,000 or something like that recently, dude turn that into a free $70,000/yr for the rest of your life and whatever other income you earn can be used for further expansion, but if literally everything else goes to shit, you always have $70,000/yr to fall back on.
Only retards think it's not cool being up 2000%+ by buying shares instead of options. That's why we call you retards. Tendies are tendies regardless, retards.

Fair point, i think that nobody is saying physical games will sell more than digital games, or that physical game sales will increase.

It's that physical games is still a huge (although decreasing % wise of total game sales) market. And the overall increase in the market size \*could\* help flatten the decreasing physical game sales in terms of net revenue. 

In 2019, global video game sales were 150 billion USD. Sony/EA and various other publishers all claim in 2019 [roughly half of game sales were still physical](https://www.ccn.com/playstation-4-digital-game-sales-overtake-physical-thats-a-first/). Keep in mind things like slow internet speed, data caps, etc will retain a core user base of physical games. In so many huge markets it's still not practical to buy digital games unless you're cool with waiting literally 7 days for your 150GB game to download. I feel like the stock has been beaten as if physical game sales will go to 0%, where realistically i think there is a huge multi-billion niche market which will remain.

&#x200B;

Also - they sell way more than just consoles/games and are also getting into PC gaming (hardware/components/accessories) which is another huge new multi billion dollar market for them.

Who knows though, i'm probably totally wrong and about to lose my $$$

> Not nearly as often as false negatives. Puts on your IQ

It really depends on how the test is designed, sometimes it's preferable to have false negatives and sometimes false positives. For example if you're detecting something deadly like HIV you want 100% detection with false positives.  

If you're detecting something like pregnancy a false negative might be preferable, so you structure the test to be less sensitive so any time a person sees a positive result it is a real positive and not a false hope.

Antigen have false positive, molecular have false negative if your viral load isn't high enough.
Don‚Äôt forget certain blood types are more resistant.

I don‚Äôt agree with the racehorse theory of good genes, but certain blood types are more adventitious in different circumstances.

It‚Äôs basically like Rock Paper Scissors.

I have no reason to lie. Obviously I don‚Äôt an exact count. But I would say that 10%-15% of the calls made went something like this. Can‚Äôt tell you why or what it means, if anything. But it‚Äôs not a lie or an outlier. I made around 1,000 calls, probably more, all around the state I live in.

Sure you can always try to time it right, but bear markets usually last more than a couple weeks(we‚Äôve been in a 3 week bleed/bear market). Anyone who was here back in 2013 knows that bear markets can last for months or even almost a full year. If you‚Äôre going to buy options you might as well buy June or dec 2021 puts. PowPow doesn‚Äôt leave the federal reserve until next August at the earliest.  By buying dated bonds you can at least work the market moment and sell out before theta starts to eat you.

I was directly calling people who had tested positive. Access to the state software and everything. I probably made 20 calls a day. Out of those I would say maybe 2 or 3 out of the 20 would tell me something along these lines. However, this was April-the end of August. I also get tested about every other week and have been negative every time

Pretty sure the stipulation is April 15 has to fall on a weekend or holiday, and even if you file an automatic extension to file in October instead of April you should be paying 90% of expected tax or else you‚Äôd likely run into penalties.

There is no PDT rule in cash accounts
Sorry I had a little beer and the comment I responded to got deleted. To back up and summarize, I was making about $40,000/yr and saved up enough to sell puts at about 2%/wk to make $40,000/yr completely off of the put-selling activity. If you made double your salary, which I think was about $70,000/yr, you could safely make 1%/wk off of thetagang plays, which would equate to your salary every year, which would mean you could essentially stop working and maintain your current lifestyle completely from the capital from your current gains. I'm both envious of that and excited for you, if you choose to go that route. I'd feel bad if you had that opportunity and decided to risk it to chase further gains. I hope to continue to save my money and get to about $200,000 in liquid capital so that I can safely make $100,000/yr at 1%/wk gains so that I never have to work again and live a comfortable lifestyle.

> The order prohibits American companies and individuals from owning shares outright - or through investment funds - in companies the administration deems to help enhance the People&#039;s Liberation Army.

> The list of firms includes large state-run aerospace and construction companies, as well technology and communications companies like Inspur Group, Huawei and China Telecommunications Corp. The U.S. contends that these companies enable China&#039;s military evolution through access to advanced technologies and expertise, and as a result, have in part led to Beijing&#039;s aggressive global expansion.

> To invest in funds that include Chinese companies would &quot;Place millions of federal employees in the untenable position of choosing between forgoing any investment in international equities, or placing billions of dollars in retirement savings in risky companies that pose a threat to U.S. national security,&quot; Scalia wrote.

Everything around you is the result of human innovation.
Consider what the average person would think of the sentence "Well that year sucked and everything I did failed, but at least I made $70,000 as my fallback plan and will forever". You'd be free to pursue literally whatever you want to do with your life. I'm rambling because I've achieved the same thing but with $35,000 lolol. I'm a little jealous of the possibilities you could do with $70k but I'm also excited at the prospect of seeing someone else do it based on a windfall. Guess it struck a nerve on an emotional day lol.

Out of all the EVs, Canoo is the one that's best to succeed. Below is copy pasta of what I just said regarding Fisker. No engineering. No proprietary technology. No prototype vehicles. No crash testing.

Canoo/HCAC designed their proprietary platform completely in house. They‚Äôve built 13 prototypes and have completed 50+ crash tests.

Fisker is relying on Magna to do all that. In exchange, they‚Äôre diluting shareholders. Fisker is a glorified design firm. I also don‚Äôt trust his advertised price. If you divide his revenue projection versus units sold, it comes out to $60K per vehicle, not $38K. People are too foolish to point this out. Fisker is no different than Nikola.

One of the biggest draws is that Canoo's management would unlock shares at $18/$25/$30 price targets. At $1.70 per warrant today, they would be $7.50/$13.50/$18.50 when it hits those price targets. They get rich, when we get rich. Did you know that Fisker and his wife have about $2B in Fisker stock? That's for a car company with no engineers and no revenue. It's pretty much Nikola all over again.
Jeffrey knows.

Edit the post to include them.
Yeah 30% is a shit ton (profit), as well as whatever the commission is for xbox game pass.  Considering they have a partnership with MSFT and that they are the biggest retail videogame store in the world, its safe to bet they are getting about the same or more than walmart, target,etc.  I have very high hopes for this stock, it should be selling at 15-20 right now (fair price).   he only problem is the market manipulation it is facing because of the large funds with shorts but one piece of good news and this stock is going to mars. 

Also in case you didn't know, 3 days ago gamestop decided to pay 150 mill of debt early ...this is huge. This goes against the narrative that this big hedges have that it will go bankrupt and that they are struggling to make a profit. [https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2020/11/11/gamestop-debt.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2020/11/11/gamestop-debt.html)

I dont know about corsair so cant give you my opinion, im personally 5k into GME and im expecting it to go 20 by eoy probably around the 40 in march earnings. I wont tell you what to do but im fairly certain that GME is going to be selling huge with this new console. Even if they don't sell that big, they are still getting 30% out of every xbox. Absolutely insane. They sold out all xbox and ps5s already and a lot demand atm. 

This is also not taking into account the massive short float that can trigger a squeeze at any moment. This can take it even higher. 

Do your own DD if you like and good luck!  BTW if you are seriously thinking of going in, right now with this $10-11 range is the perfect value. It was $9 before MSFT announcement and paid off debt. So im not expecting it to go any lower than this.

I mean if you had held pretty much any ITM weekly call purchased on a Friday at EOD until the following Friday you would have had a chance at some point for profit.
my dd was on acb. first of all, acb is canadian amd it's a trash company. they are burning through so much money without making any. anything other than acb is fine. apha looks decently valued and tilray just has that retard strength while being a much better company and you can see their progress over the years if u look at their finsncials. but i think grwg is a really good company when it comes to weed but dont think it could go that high, idk

Is FOX news more trustworthy than CNN? It‚Äôs bigger after all it must be more true.

a) it‚Äôs possible that people in power have an agenda and will use every means possible to fulfill it,

b) it‚Äôs possible not to trust a single news source blindly, 

and c) it‚Äôs possible that *some* news is more true than other news regardless of its publisher.

>  The patterns are not different, just the pace. I don't remember when "sector rotations" started at 9am and ended at 4pm on the same day only to go right back the stuff it rotated out of.

I don't read that as new paradigms, I read that as the death throes of a market that's double the length of the normal reset time period and had so many buybacks and QE cycles poured into it that it's frothy as hell and will continue to increase in volatility until it breaks the artificial support.

There is way too much dumb money in the market right now - too many retirement age people that should be out - too many young people that think it can't go down to the highs prior to the previous crash like it normally would, or maybe even think it can't really crash at all.  And no I don't buy the "nowhere else to put your money" means that the market can't crash.

If you're really 40 you're old enough to know better. And I'm not saying that as an insult, I'm saying you've seen people say these exact things before a crash. *"It's different this time..."*

There are still buyers of options on date of expiration, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed that you‚Äôre going to get max value. If the stock booms, though, there‚Äôs a higher likelihood of a successful sale. Otherwise you‚Äôre stuck with either executing or losing the gain.

Their first suborbital test flight, after the success of which, they will get contracts from nasa, and private businesses  and will be cleared for other cool shit in 2021, like the founder Richard Branson going to space in one of the virgin rockets in q1 2021. before every event the stock runs up massively and this time around, i think it's going higher than before. we'll see.
Eh, already hoped of the nio train w 5k rather observe at this point

Why not sell all and use part of the profits to buy a dated wedge so you can try to time the market, or hope for a 25% move in either direction if you end up holding both to expiration.

MOSTLY DUE TO NIO

This last week i made my yearly salary. 

The last 2 weeks i made my yearly salary x 2. 

The desire to go to work to make a meager 7.5k a month is not there when you have 20-30k days. I have more money now then ive ever had in my life and idk what to with it. someone give me a yolo play for 200k to x 5 my money and be a millionaire next week so i can quit my job.
The big boys are running the numbers and market is following trying to find a range for the explosive market.   But you look at the 1 day chart and think you're a fuckin wizard timing a fall.   Many have died on that sword.
NIO was up 1.5% AH

Where you getting 3%?
Damn coming out swinging with some half assed comment XD
I don't think anyone is going to risk that here

Buy 3 month calls, slightly otm

Sell weeklies against those as time goes

Roll your long calls to next month matching premium (higher strike) and keep collecting

Then one day your stock of choice has a phenomenal well, you're slightly otm calls go itm and you cash out, until a week later the stock comes back to earth and you go full balls deep in it and rinse and repeat

Henrik Fisker was forced to open this company, because he is unemployable in the auto industry. He gimped the Model S design for Tesla. No-one wants to work with him, in the fear that they would lose business with Tesla. Elon isn‚Äôt a forgiving person and he doesn‚Äôt forget.

He was once a talented car designer. However, his designs seem somewhat aged. His design looks fine for a car released in the past 5 years, but with all the other EV SUVs coming out in the next 5 years, his would looked old AF in comparison.

Why not just buy a spy january wedge? Buy calls and puts as close as you can itm x2 and try to time the selling of both right. Try to wait till you get +110% going one way before selling out so you hit 10% gain with hopes of hitting a rebound, or timing it right to recover partial losses thanks to time.

Thanks for the input. 30% is pretty good. But is it 30% of retail cost or 30% of profit? Wouldn‚Äôt it be the latter seeing as how xBox sells themselves at this point.

You think Fisker is more developed than most other EV‚Äôs? What are you smoking? He only designed the car. No engineering. No proprietary technology. No prototype vehicles. No crash testing.

Canoo/HCAC designed their proprietary platform completely in house. They‚Äôve built 13 prototypes and have completed 50+ crash tests. 

Fisker is relying on Magna to do all that. In exchange, they‚Äôre diluting shareholders. Fisker is a glorified design firm. I also don‚Äôt trust his advertised price. If you divide his revenue projection versus units sold, it comes out to $60K per vehicle, not $38K. People are too foolish to point this out. Fisker is no different than Nikola.
That would be a $100k a dose item

I'd rather watch something twice than watch ads. And these days I'm not really motivated by any TV shows enough to download them.
IDK, as soon as the news broke that he is pretty much guaranteed the presidency, other countries immediately started with talks putting sanctions on China. Think America's position is going to be the same as soon as Trump is out, seeing as the transition isn't as smooth as 2016 despite the same allegations and divisiveness.
I'd be genuinely happy. 

I was supportive of his Mars project before he started saying they won't follow earth's laws at all and SpaceX will make up their own.

Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services.

Buy shares and collect a dividend if you're long on oil. I think we've hit a bottom for E&Ps. As soon as there is more positive vaccine news it could be the easiest money. But until then, more cases, cities threatening lock down.. E&Ps, refiners, and midstream just keep tanking. Also going into winter, there is usually a lul in demand due to weather. This year holiday travel will probably be the lowest in decades.
Just jump on January calls
Safe to say to say yesterday was a bear trap?
I held them for nearly a year.  I want to trade bets in them but I don't know options well.

Herman Cain
I also approve
I would put it in other words.

Make your gains and go out because nobody wants to own a NIO.

Sae way nobody wants to wear Li Nings. They want to wear Jordans
Gamble. Come back again
My dumbass sold my NIO FDs 45c and 47c for a 2-300% gain today thinking friday was going to be red. Damn my paper hands and your welcome NIO call holders.
Had a bad day so I decided to watch Joker. Whoops. Should I follow up the mood with Uncut Gems or should I chase with Wolf of Wall Street for a palette cleanse? Both are new watches. Feeling better, just bummed at having to proactively dodge the gym and bars due to covid cases rising.

u think its gonna dump lol?
I think they said it‚Äôs two years
Has anyone famous died from covid?
The move is NIO calls even more than usual tomorrow if there‚Äôs a good dip to buy from the elongated muskrat getting the flu
Too retarded too
Buy more puts on Nikola bc why not. It's still not bankrupt yet and I don't know if GM is going to play along after December.
 I approve
Proof or ban

Buy some NIO so my puts will print
Elon will be fine stfu that shit is a cold.
Inverse that so there‚Äôs still a sell off ü•Ç

Anyone thoughts on Fisker ? $FSR 

Long way out, but think could be a good hold.

Especially when considering performance of these CHina EVs.

Dunno but I recon this going to moon 2021.

Looks like it‚Äôs pullin‚Äô out
Everybody expects a Friday sell off therefore moon
Move to a state with no income tax and cash that shit out 1/1/21
We‚Äôre in the best coast
Those of you buying calls, I wish you well. I want us all here to do well, but ignoring the hedging would be silly. At least protect yourself against the potential fall.
only chess I know of..
Papa Elon gonna need a day off. But better he gets it now than when he's 90 and dies.

If you do boomer investing in mutual funds, having a good advisor can get you way lower fees into top performing funds without having to worry about $1M+ min investment thresholds (almost to the point where the savings pay for the advisor). You then get a lot of other info/advice/access you wouldn't get elsewhere. But, most advisors won't talk to you unless you have a few hundred K to invest with them, but that's not super wealthy IMO
I hear ya. It's gonna be interesting to see where and how they manage that operating income. Almost all their growth is in media services now. Considering everything, they've managed really well coming from 53 million in daily revenue from parks in the past. Since the market is grossly efficient in looking forward, I can't imagine how high Disney stock price will be once the pandemic is behind us.

Is it a possibility that GME could be the new Blockbuster by the middle of next year? If so, should I wait for GME to pump then buy cheaper Puts for July 16 2021? 

I just don‚Äôt see how they can keep a profit when  newer games can be downloaded. The new generation of gamers might not even care about having a physical disk anymore or play older used games on older consoles. If GME flops on the Q1 earnings call, wouldn‚Äôt a long term PUT be the answer?

If anyone bothered to read the most recent prospectus that NIO put out, there is absolutely no way they would continue to invest in them.

There are way too many red flags to list, but here's just a tiny bit of them:

* We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
   * Our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interest**s**, and ability to protect their rights through U.S. courts may be limited because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.
   * Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies.
* Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country(?????), may differ significantly from the NYSE corporate governance listing standards.
   * We are a Cayman Islands company and our PRC subsidiaries are considered foreign-invested enterprises.
      * \[...\] It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China.
      * Shareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China.
* The majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our vehicles in China.
* We plan to mainly sell our vehicles in China for the near future.
* Changes in China's political or social conditions or government policies could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Substantially all of our revenues are expected to be derived in China in the near future and most of our operations, including all of our manufacturing, is conducted in China.
   * Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are influenced by economic, political and legal developments in China.
   * The PRC government exercises significant control over China's economic growth through strategically allocating resources, controlling the payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.
   * From time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative
   * Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation.
   * On March 15, 2019, the National People's Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which has become effective on January 1, 2020
      * Since the Foreign Investment Law is newly enacted, uncertainties still exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify whether variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangements would be deemed as foreign invested enterprises if they are ultimately "controlled" by foreign investors.
      * Therefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations or provisions to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment. There can be no assurance that our contractual arrangements will not be deemed to be in violation of the market access requirements for foreign investment under the PRC laws and regulations.
   * As the interpretation and implementation of labor-related laws and regulations are still evolving, our employment practices may violate labor-related laws and regulations in China, which may subject us to labor disputes or government investigations. We cannot assure you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all labor-related law and regulations including those relating to obligations to make social insurance payments and contribute to the housing provident funds.
* To comply with the Catalogue before it is amended by the 2018 Negative List, we had planned to conduct certain operations that were then subject to restrictions on foreign investment under the Catalogue in China through Shanghai NIO Energy Automobile Co., Ltd., or NIO New Energy.
   * NIO Co., Ltd. owns 50% equity interests in NIO New Energy
   * Our founders Bin Li and Lihong Qin, through holding equity interests in Shanghai Anbin Technology Co., Ltd. indirectly own 40% and 10%, respectively, of the equity interests in NIO New Energy.
      * Because of the ownership of 50% equity interests of NIO New Energy and these contractual arrangements, we are the primary beneficiary of NIO New Energy and hence consolidate its financial results as our variable interest entity under U.S. GAAP.
      * In the opinion of Han Kun Law Offices, our PRC legal counsel, (i) the ownership structures of NIO Co., Ltd. And our variable interest entities in China do not result in any violation of PRC laws and regulations currently in effect;
      * However, we have been advised by our PRC legal counsel that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules, and there can be no assurance that the PRC regulatory authorities will take a view that is consistent with the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.
* The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People's Bank of China.
   * The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China.
   * We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB.
      * If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders
   * PRC regulations may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.

I agree with the guy below on getting a leap. A lot of these covid value plays are in a position where either they go fuckin bankrupt or have so much debt that they may as well be, or they live to fight another day and rebound. Calls are the perfect play here because calls thrive on price movements where the probabilities have fat tails, i.e ford either dies a shit death or ford moons. In the former, you lose less with a call than shares, in the latter, you make more with a call than with shares. If Ford is at the same price in 2 years I'll be shocked.

That said, I don't think Ford is attractive at this price personally. If I were you I wouldn't play it, but if you are going to play it and you want limited downside and still capture the upside, buy LEAPs 2 years out.

It sounds like financial advice but it isn't because I can't give that shit.

Insane amount of puts for the s&p right now. The expiry of the 16th has more than double the put volume to calls. Tomorrow is your last day to buy some puts before it fucks down in the short term.

Fuck your vaccine, it isn't ready yet.
I guess old money is rotten by now.
there is a risk you know, you could lose the 500k if there's some king of unforeseen event to fuck your strategy, so people are not willing to take the risk I guess.

Yeah a lot of the new good shit at that time was being bought from the original Silk Road, that place was legit before it got roped.

It‚Äôs funny though, because if I actually found 25-I now I‚Äôm able to confirm the compound. Currently I‚Äôm the head R+D chemist a large lab network now so I have four LC-MS/MS‚Äôs & 3 GC-MS/MS‚Äôs at my disposal to run whatever with very little oversight.

So if I get something someone calls 25-I, I can just rip like 1/25th of it off & dissolve in methanol, set up a method with the literature MRM transitions (using www.sci-hub.se for free papers if you aren‚Äôt already), & confirm the presence or absence myself.

He had a garage to build Amazon. That makes him an automatic millionaire in my book. Can't afford one these days.
Yes, by and large I believe the facts that are presented in news reports by what you call the main stream media, because I understand the quantity & quality of journalists & sources involved in producing news stories, as well as the editorial standards that actual, bonafide news publications have in place. 

You, on the other hand, just by phrasing it as the main stream media, are suggesting that some other stream of news -- small time reporting, individuals with opinions on twitter -- are somehow superior to large organizations who publish news. 

is that what you're saying?  

to think that you have some superior insight into what is actually happening globally because you follow some low budget, politically motivated (all media is politically motivated, recognize that, because people are involved in news decisions) website / twitter account is frankly very scary to me, because it implies that you have a disregard for organizational size as evidence of truthfulness. 

The simple truth is that in large media organizations, with large amounts of educated people, falsehoods don't last long. Yes, they can underreport on topics you care about, but it is actually small organizations which pose the greatest fraud (fake news) risk, simply because there is no verification infrastructure in place. 

please do respond to this

Obviously. 32k to 1mil is a 3000%+ return. The only way you would ever see that one a weekend is if you bought thousands of like 270 spy puts and we had a black Monday. Or you‚Äôre inside trading on some shit like that cancer drug company that hit this week. It‚Äôs impossible üòÇ you could conceivably make 500% a week 5 weeks and a row and hit 1mil but still. Retardedly risky. I only made 600%+ over the last 2 weeks because I made a couple risky plays, deposited money to double down on plays that worked luckily and I was only at about 1100 2 weeks ago. Big % is much easier to make the less you have in the market. Liquidity‚Äôs a bitch.

I microdosed L for a few months. 

Went for a liquid dilution. Put a stamp in a 10mL volumetric flask & filled with 10mL deionized water, let is diffuse for 12 hrs in the dark.

Much easier to accurately microdose as a dissolved solution. Drinking 1 mL = 1/10th a stamp, etc. 

Reliable source pegged the stamp at ~100 ug L. 1 mL (~10 ug) was a nice underlying 12hr enervator. 2 mL (~20 ug) was edging recreational but not noticeable. Just straight up having a good time.
Same.
Already up 8% to .13

FAANG are corporate big brother. They store all your details and sell them. As long as you implicitly agree to a TOS, you have 0 privacy. 

The government does not do such a thing. There are laws and checks and balances which regulate the governments intelligence activities. That law is here: [https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html) The bottom line: you can't surveil a US person unless they're a criminal suspect and you have a warrant. Unless you argue that the law is a farce, in which case I'll dismiss myself from the conversation.

There was a time in my life when I believed many conspiracy theories. You should question who's mind is really the one that is being controlled.

You believe that there's a massive conspiracy that every free American news outlet (with the exception of a few conservative ones,  like Fox, I am guessing) are complicit in fraud, but it's more likely that one person, who has a demonstrable track record of lying and not honoring his obligations (2x bankruptcy!) is telling you the truth.

Are you sure?

When I believed conspiracy theories it was because there was something else in my life that needed to be fixed: primarily it was having a good job and enough money that I had proper sleep and nutrition and didn't have to struggle to live. Are all your needs as a human currently satiated?

20k in uvxy calls
I got it from a good friend of mine around 2011, then a year or so after I started hearing about deaths due to it & I haven‚Äôt heard about it since.

~12 hour experience, blotter, had to hold it under my tongue for like 20 minutes for bioavailabilty. 

Immaculately blank slate headspace in 30 min, no physical jitters. Still that sense of ‚Äòself‚Äô, but like happy & excited to be with other people & learn from them & remap my neural nets with their experiences.

I dosed that first time by myself 4th of July 2012, & then 4 hours into it my roommates randomly threw a kegger at our place. Socially integrated seamlessly & had a great time, no hesitation. Ethanol slowly dulled it but still definitely feeling it at like 5AM.

I was kind of giving him too much credit. I'm sure you're aware of the recent revelations about the amount of debt he owes, over 400 million. Some sources say an entire billion.

If you don't believe any of the media though I guess everything is a lie, right? So you should take Trump's word for everything, since what he says is definitely true, and all the media are liars. Perfect logic, right?

Yeah. Don't yolo. Do research. Do TA. Then buy if you're still comfortable.
I don't think that was what caused their separation.

I am pretty sure it came out during their divorce that they were separated for over a year at that point, and MacKenzie was the one that introduced them.

If we lose Elon to covid I'm shooting myself
I feel like the 'recovery' Powell mentioned was primarily due to the stimulus injection and for now is temporary, it doesn't seem like the overall economy has truly improved that much. The overall consumer sentiment isn't that great, peeps are still worried about their jobs, real estate vacancies in prime districts around the world are still pretty high, etc... Also, I feel like the global economic recovery hinges on the US getting a handle of the virus which is nowhere in sight right now... They need more stimulus to keep this momentum going for now...

Puts on Friday calls on Monday.
Dude, I sold BABA puts twice this month already and should make out with $3000 in premium.

First I sold a BABA $280 weekly put last week when IV spiked through the fucking roof, then I did it again with 2 puts for $260 for next Friday. Boght at close on Tuesday, had I waited on Wednesday I would have gotten another $300 or so I think. But sell puts when the premium is high so theta decay works in your favor.

BYND was another easy play but I did it because I bought shares the day before, and if I got assigned it was a win/win because I average down and collect the premium. Closed those out around 85% profit just to be safe

NIO and TSLA are both going bankrupt, but just in case they're legit, only NIO will survive.

 There isn't enough battery material mining or production to supply both. In a war for batteries and rare earths China wins. They DGAF about giving entire 3rd world countries lobster claw hands if it speeds up extraction 1%. They are hoovering up all the IP from the Chinese TSLA factory and throwing the full weight of their military and belt and road behind it. 

What does TLSA have to fight back? Ok fine, Hunter Biden is a capable man, but Elon needs state capitalism, not Chinese footjobs.

Yes, there are some very smart, talented, and passionate engineers in defense, but those are far fewer in comparison than big tech.

You win!
What do you guys say about PTON puts? To early?
Nah. I play them all, going up and going down.
Told my wife‚Äôs boyfriend to buy calls
I think 50/50 chance it prints tomorrow, if it breaks $350 earlier in the day then likely, but if it does late in the day or tests it and bounces but doesn't bounce much then early next week. If it does break $350 and finds support at $347 I'd close it if you they are 11/13 contracts...
Ok, fine. Figured I should finally try options. Just bought a single contract, lol. Baby steps.
I‚Äôm no expert, but I would say having three other companies to compete with is good business for him, especially when he is american based while they are china based. It allows him to advertise ‚ÄúThe True American Electric Vehicle‚Äù while also showing that his business is better than 3 others. Essentially he COULD gobble them up, but at the moment it‚Äôs just making his company look better by having Electric vehicles get more popular.

Edit: 
And also having HIS vehicles specifically sell more, also.

Edit: Looks like Citron gobbled up $NIO instead OOF.

Idk how you do it without getting assigned man, last week I sold $37 calls, $37! For 1k, then I lost 7k in gains, yea I get it high IV, but jeez I can't do it for nio lol, feel like sell calls is only for boomer stocks

wow im a fucking retard for throwing that game
For sure and I think we see new ATHs. Sort term after earnings... there will more than likely be a pull back
it wont. amazon and target and walmart will still be open 

big biz will still get rich. only the poors will suffer 

unemployment will stabilize since mostly its WFH at this point anyway

stimulus will come next year at some point - if that gets fucked then and only then will the market get scurred
there are so many bullish news that would make this play unprofitable. more vaccine news from mrna, jnj, azn coming very soon and pfe looking for fda approval within in 2 weeks. stimulus talk is coming back soon, ccl setting sail again in dec, no sail is still lifted, i think right now is a pretty fair price.
Pitcher, fast ball for sure.
Lockdowns coming starting Thanksgiving till end of year.  You heard it here first.
Absolutely tragic. Well done
Why I‚Äôm bearish: there‚Äôs literally no good news left, these cuck bulls have pulled every fucking card out. Circuit breaker or we destroy every trace of this stupid failure of a vaccine. Gay bears unite üôåüèª

Lol. Good luck man. I guess I am just anti-global elite. I am not for the super rich controlling life. Not too keen on media and big tech telling me how to live so that's why I support Trump.

Every dip getting bought up it seems like. If you want a long position, wait for a deep red day, they might drill below $100 again and I am loading up. It stayed under $100 for like 3 hours total. Raced right back up every time

That last dump wasn't even *that* insane. It had a gap to fill between $100 and $120, it filled it and IMO it is going to continue going higher until they show slowing growth.

Which they won't because they are building new factories and rolling out new products. I don't even think any new Tread sales were counted for this quarter.
damn I'm hoping to get a fraction of this luck. I just want to make it past 20k in returns so I can get back on my feet. I can't afford to invest big yet but little returns here and there sure are nice to see
People celebrating vaccines don't know how pandemics work. Large amount of people die within a small amount of time. Vaccine that works 100% if rolled out tomorrow wouldn't prevent it since we're in the midst of a second wave.

I‚Äôve had three very clean, effortlessly enjoyable experiences with this compound. If shrooms are legalized & accepted, I feel like 25-I is the endgame of exploring that receptor pathway.

Nope. It is a boomer stock. It will likely slow dip away. Their revenue are still down drastically from YOY unlike many other tech stocks. This is a boomer tech stock.

I don‚Äôt really care about making profit if they could grow fast consistently but trading at 25x ttm and only expect 30% growth next year is kinda scuffed

Probably not for a minute. Same with FedEx unfortunately (for me anyways, have 300 company options that I was gifted at a 272 strike...). The anticipation is that next year people will either A) run out of stimmy to buy random crap and/or B) with vaccine, people will start going back to brick and mortar.

Obviously whether that is the case will yet to be seen. It will probably be another year or two before either company sees another jump up.

U/disco_steve_phd you asked me to pay before losing. I will pay if I lose but yoi better be prepared to do the same.
Yeah but you gotta factor in maintenance costs. People renting a Lamborghini are not going to treat it well. Grinding the gears and shit because they‚Äôve never driven stick. Going clubbing and some party girl pukes in the front. Racing off a red light and fucking the axel on a pot hole. So many problems.
You can put the word "shitty" anywhere in that sentence to fix it
I mean, fair enough. But it simply is true that 99% of the DD you'll find is either:

1) Retarded

or

2) Actually malicious and trying to get you to buy into bad plays (pump and dumps, etc). 

NIO is the perfect example. There are thousands of shills going to WSB, stocktwits, and everywhere else to get people to buy in. You can probably make some money on intraday calls, but I fucking guarantee you this is a pump'n'dump scheme, and people telling you to buy are doing so with massive self-interest.

You can try to set limit order before open. Getting filled is hard though. I've tried limit orders on underlyings positive they will either gap up or down on market open but have had no success getting filled. I've tried with robinhood, TOS and etrade. Maybe someone else has had positive results. I've even tested a range high enough to where I am overpaying and still didn't get filled.

Honestly I can see $16 as pretty likely, but your budget is super small to be messing with calls bro. You could definitely give it a shot. DM me for other options though, me and a few guys are in a discird server where all we do is play SPY and provide good potential plays on a ton of tickers

I feel like when really good DD gets posted it gets trashed by haters and ‚Äúdevil‚Äôs advocate‚Äù types and that dissuades posters from wanting to put in the work.
" nah, given their line of work they were likely focused on the mission and didn't care so much about profits " -  wishful thinking. LOL

That doesn't mean anything that just means insiders can dump their shares when the lockup ends in Feburary and invest elsewhere.

Eh the thing is I don‚Äôt expect to make money on the put, but if I lose locking in a 50% loss then I only lose a thousand bucks, and I think something like some spy 340 puts a month and a half out have a good chance of yielding a 2x or 3x payoff, and a slim chance of a giant payoff. I think the expected payoff is positive, even if the odds of it working out are not. Most likely we stay flat or go up a little and my long positions are happy.
The best DD is the DD you come up with yourself.

People who come up with truly genius DD don't share it. Why would they?

Most people sharing DD don't have your best interests in mind.

Just do the work and find your own plays. Don't trust some random genius to take you to valhalla.

- pick one stock like AMZN TSLA SE and just dollar cost average over the next 10 years like $100 per week... setup a recurring investment and then delete the app. Check in 2030.

So basically, let‚Äôs say you buy this call tomorrow and it doesn‚Äôt hit $17.5 but does hit somewhere around $16.5-$17, you still make money as long as you sell before expiration.

So if on the 18th or 19th you have some nice gains and want to sell your call which is worth maybe $50 or $70 all you have to do is sell it and not execute it

I said a space company outsourced by the US Govt. I'll expand on that by saying he's had many successful manned missions. Neither other company you mentioned can say that.

Who followed who into the hyperloop space? Branson, again. I like the guy(a lot, my hypothetical boat is moored right off his private island) but he doesn't perform at the level elon does.

EVs failed in the early 90s because the world wasn't ready. Much like solar failed in the 50s and 60s. My reference to Elon being one of the first in solar panels was a targeted point at the value they currently represent in today's market.

My post wasn't to deter ppl from entering elon's sandbox; in fact he's stated he wouldn't care if tesla or space x failed and lost money as long as they developed markets that grew because he sees these areas of commerce as essential to the development of a sustainable and everlasting human race.

Best counterargument yet tho.

Still would like a source. Not doubting it.

Personally I think swapping isn‚Äôt a good idea. But in China its more feasible nor necessary come future. 

But NIO has sole support from CCP with battery swapping as per their tax subsidy. So NIO will do well with it for a while.

Yep.  I was literally that generation of trader, back when Netscape was a thing. In fact, a lot of us were gutted because we couldn't front run the retail guys as pros.

I like your skepticism but your sarcasm is off target and your belligerence is puzzling. What's different this time is the pace.  Remember garbage like Pets.com and JDSU or WorldCom or global crossing? I do.  I'm Canadian so i'll throw in 360Networks, fucking bid.com, and Nortel.  Back then the biggest companies were not the dot.coms but financials and stuff like Barrick Gold. the biggest companies today are all tech. I honestly don't remember if all those vaporized at the same time but you get the point. 

It's an entirely different market because the participants are entirely different.  I worked for RBC and their online platform hadnt even conceptualized yet.  You're telling me the guy who had to call his broker for 3% commission is the same 20-something who is flipping options on his phone?

I got Li and Nio shares, some XPEV shares, and an XPEV call. Small bits, but I was up $450 today. I couldn't daytrade because of the robinhood limit, so I'm only up $50 now. Hoping it rises again tomorrow, don't really feel like putting 25k into robinhood just so I can day trade. That or I'm too scared to find out if I would've sold my call and shares immediately instead of waiting for the peak. Probably the latter, seeing as my money in Li, NIO, and XPEV peaked at $450 instead of $80,000 :)

This is definitely part of it. RH's "smoothed" charts override actual highs and lows. If you click on the high for the day, for example, it will give a number well below the actual high. And it will make choppiness look like a fucking mega-rally straight line up or down.

Bro that's the internet. There are even people with thousands of followers who just share other content but stamp their face on it. This one dude on tiktok literally shows jpgs of optical illusions from Google images and gets hundreds of comments saying how amazing he is for making them lol. Of course he never says he did make them but he also never credits the artist or anything. 

Even just youtube searching "what is options trading" there's 900 videos and I bet next year there will be 900 more saying the same stuff.
>1. Americans like to own their whole vehicle, so it didnt catch on very well. 

Considering how many lease and ride share I am not sure 


>2. supercharger network already existed. essentially one service that was already in existence and people were used to doing was out competing a newer service. 

I realistically dont think this will be a realistic option if EVs are actually adopted at the scale they are predicting. Thats a big load on power demands. As is you are restricted with the amount of superchargers you can install on you property in some states. Imagine countries that already have rolling black outs to help manage energy demand.
