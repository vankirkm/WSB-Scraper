 In AZ, Biden currently leads by approximately 93,500 votes. There were 605K votes cast on Election Day. Trump would need to pull 57.73% of those votes to win. Team Trump says they're pulling 62% in Maricopa County, and 72-80% in other counties. They're projecting a 30k-40k win. 

 In PA, Trump is up by approximately 454K votes. There are 1.12M votes outstanding; Biden needs 78% of those votes to win the state. 300K of those votes are in Philadelphia. Even if Biden wins 95% of those votes, he still needs to pull 70% of the other votes. That's a heavy lift.

This isn't what I expected out of a leftist; usually they just care about racism, police violence, lgbtq rights, or whatever other bogeyman they are presented with to distract them from the larger issues (primarily wealth inequality; which is responsible for the ills "systemic racism" is blamed for. Poor whites are as bad off as anyone else.) 

I agree with everything you said basically, but the Democrats as they are today don't actually tackle these issues. They pander to them to support their power base but that is about it. 

Which is why I say both sides are trash

So far the logic of Trump and his supporters:

- stop counting in states that I'm losing
- recount and MAKE SURE to count all the votes in the states that I could possibly win
- we can declare victory because we are TEMPORARILY in the lead, no need to wait for the rest of votes to count
- why are all these mail-in ballots being counted so late? Also, our republican state legislators stopped Democrat attempts to allow the states to count days before election so we wouldn't be in this mess üôÑ
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd do the same for you.
Sounds about right.
You hate to see it folks
Got to make sure Trump can‚Äôt win before they are counted

There's never been a single election anywhere where at least one side tried to stop some class from being counted.  Women didn't even vote for most of US history so far. They don't see it as anti patriotic they see it as a duty to make sure the right votes count and the rest don't.

Yeah this was one of those things that really irritated me. On one side it's a matter of bodily autonomy and to the other it was literally child murder.

A naked call is when you sell a call but do not have the 100 shares the contract implies. If you do it's called a covered call. A naked call is the dumbest move in all of options trading as your loss possibility is infinity.

There is not really a naked put. Typically when you sell a put its cash secured, meaning you have money, either margin or real, to cover the cost of buying the 100 shares if the contract goes in the money and you get exercised. If you are selling a put without cash or margin then I suppose that could be considered naked as you may get margin called because its retarded.

Trump is literally orchestrating a coup. Officially claiming states in which not nearly all ballots have been counted. This is insane
Ya to add on I think the market priced in certain outcomes like public unrest, burning of ballots, etc. Now that those outcomes are less likely, the market confidence goes up. I AM surprised how a republican senate + democratic pres is still rallying the market because now stimulus money seems less certain.

I know this isn‚Äôt the place for politics but I have to say what‚Äôs on everyone‚Äôs mind. 

Election Day was yesterday. Time for these states to wrap up these post election ballots, stop counting and roll back these fraudulent votes. Need to certify the November 3rd results (Election day) before Trump is harmed (I believe the LEGALESE term is ‚Äústanding‚Äù) and gets the SC to clean up this mess. You can‚Äôt have a winner and then flip the results by rigging the process days after. Does nobody find it even a little bit concerning that these after Election Day ballot dumps are so devastating? Nope. Big NOPE. We‚Äôre taking this to the Supreme Court where we have the majority (since unnamed ex-president decided not to fill a seat hoping for a Hillary win and we had to do their job and fill 3 seats).

BIG EDIT really glad we got Amy into the SC. That should clean up this mess nicely. Kavanaugh was right: suspicions of impropriety will result if absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election. Dems already tried this same exact trick in 2000 and we cleaned it up nicely in the courts (see Bush v Gore). We should all be united on this (Democrats and Republicans- I‚Äôm a devoted Democrat so that should tell you how fraudulent this looks). Election Day is November 3rd, not November 4th or 5th or 6th. These middle of the night ballots clearly need to be thrown out - Republican AND Democrat ballots - I‚Äôm not prejudice one way or the other. 

Also, we need to remember that some of these blue states that have been ‚Äúcalled‚Äù may actually flip red once our mail in ballots are tallied; we may not know the real results for a few months. But, I think the Supreme Court will rule that if Libs can vote after the election, they will allow us to vote in Blue states after those elections as well. I don‚Äôt think we will need to resort to these fail-stops as I‚Äôm sure the SC will simply toss the After-Election Day vote tallying but there are several SC Ruling scenarios that will give us back OUR ELECTION DAY WIN (god, I can‚Äôt stress this enough). I would not want to be in Biden‚Äôs camp right now.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I am a Democrat, voted for Biden in Primaries and yesterday (IN PERSON) and even convinced a few friends to flip their vote for him because I hate Trump but I am absolutely disgusted at what my party is trying to do in stealing his election win AFTER ELECTION DAY! That‚Äôs not how democracy works. DEMOCRACY IS NOT SUPPOSED TO DIE IN THE DARKNESS. We lost yesterday, we need to cut our losses and focus on 2022 and 2024. Our blue wave turned out to be a blue turd but that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to give up. LETS GO! #Bluewave2022 #Bluewave2024

Today featured the greatest manipulation ever lol. 

3% rally, -20% Vix , to make everyone‚Äôs put expire worthless. People keep trying to make up reasons for the rally, lol the reason is everyone had puts and had to get fucked.

We didn‚Äôt even get a result. Vix should‚Äôve stayed up, but nope.
So how is it different than a human dick...?
So, what's the DEAL. Am I selling?

How the fuck did SVMK (SurveyMonkey) go up today after pollsters were once again shown to be full of shit? Probably just following QQQ.

well mangoman did have some very suspicious emergency "checkups" in the hospital that they tried to keep quiet.  But honestly - I expect Joe to possibly step down after 2 years.
They captured Cramer with a burlap sack, dumped a couple kilos of coke in it with a couple murder hornets and gave the whole lot a good shake before throwing some makeup on him and sending him out to do BATTLE

Taxes in Canada are not necessarily higher than the US. It depends where you live and what you make. The average tax for a single person in Canada is about 22.8% in Canada vs 26.1% in the US. The top tax bracket in the US is also 37% vs Canadas 33%.

That's your problem, everything you've ever thought was wrong. If you were wrong about something as simple as a website forum you are probably wrong about your choice of president. 

And whatever you think of this reply is wrong, it's you who carries the extra chromosome you mongolid moron.

No but Biden is getting pretty senile, who knows what that will cause.
He‚Äôs actually nervous while he‚Äôs saying that. He knows deep inside Biden will win
So many lib soy boys in here I'm surprised
I'm holding 11/6 4.5c, was betting on a giant pump if blue wave hit, but this is just as good
Or what, they'll lose their seat? lol. They all just ran down ballot of a complete loser against the most well funded Dems in years and still pulled out wins. 

They'll go back to 'fiscal responsibility' so fast your head will spin.

This election is too juicy! üí¶
Trump so fucked, glad to see his supporters lose their god, it‚Äôs been really awful to travel abroad since trump besides the inability to since February so I guess that still makes it suck. At least I won‚Äôt have to explain to people how he got elected anymore

70% of mail in votes are democratic votes

Republicans then wonder why they have no votes coming in thru the mail

It's all on Nevada now. Biden is currently leading but it's by less than a point
Politics are not the ones who are butthurt today... Biden has won. r/trump is freaking the fuck out it's so funny.
Who do you guys think Melania will leave Trump for, now that she knows he's heavily in debt and will lose everything when Deutsche Bank seizes everything he owns, which is likely to happen as soon as he loses the election?
futures opened red so this means green by morning i think
sleepy j now -900 on my betting site

What do we think will happen to the market if sleepy wins and Trump says "nah"
It‚Äôs called a protest vote, look it up ya retard. I didn‚Äôt like either candidate, but instead of staying home, and having the parties think they weren‚Äôt doing a good job of turning out the vote, it lets them know I disagree with their choices for candidates. Shit ain‚Äôt always black and white.
It‚Äôs a 2003-2007 Honda Accord.
It's my favorite thing to have 50% calls and 50% puts and wake up in the morning to see every one of them is down. There should be an award for that. Call it the Irish Vulture or something.
Biden won Michigan. No way he loses Nevada. My God did the old dude do it? I can't wait to see the rage Trump spews on Twitter over the next month.
I‚Äôve never had TD block my deposit for so long for options WTF? Usually clears second day

Good because Joey B looks like he needs his diaper changed soon.
In a year. Pussy.
It's not enough that only Donald should be punished with jail time. His entire disgusting family has profitted through his presidency, by being appointed to political offices that they had 0 qualifications for, and making hundreds of millions in the process. 

The entire trump family's assets that were acquired during his presidency should be confiscated, and every member of that family should be tried and jailed for life, except for Baron and that east european whore. her only crime was gold digging the wrong person
Dude. The odds of that being true are stastically impossible

If the GOP just stops being racist, they'd actually get a lot of support from minorities. A lot of us are pretty conservative on all matters, including immigration, but we only vote Democrat 'cause they don't wanna kill us.

As an example, British Indians have been leaning more and more conservative over the years.

Where PA stands:

- Trump's edge is down to about 300k.

- About 900k mail ballots uncounted yet.

- Biden still winning 78% of those.

- If - again IF - that % holds, Biden would surpass Trump's advantage.

President is just a single person = it honestly doesn't matter who wins.

The Senate + HoR on the other hand? They're the people who actually introduce bills and pass them.

Currently Republicans hold the slight majority, thus even if Biden wins, Biden wouldn't be able to break up tech giants or impose heavy taxes = market continues pumping

this is something that sounds smart if you dont think about it at all, but digging down just sounds retarded.

Ant was valued at $225bn, meaning BABA has a stake of \~75bn. BABA lost $60bn in market cap on tuesday, nearly equal to the ENTIRETY of their equity investment in ANT. Even if ANT was deemed to be worth $100bn, BABA would have still been oversold.

Sorry bud but you're retarded trying to short BABA because they have a minority stake in a company that will probably still get listed at the same valuation

Anybody remember when AP announced that Clinton clinched the primary the night before California voted by counting superdelegate votes?
We should be so lucky
10% is nothing lol. I want a 200-300% run
Is that why the huge rally today?
Because the rest are mail in ballots which skew democratic. And the districts that are not 100% historically vote more democratic.
Lol makes zero sense dont tell these guys though
I'm not disagreeing with you on Trump being unelectable. I'm just saying a large majority of his voters would see Giuliani spewing conspiracy theories and be unaffected by the ridiculousness of it. They wouldn't eat it up.  They are worried about policies and judges, not the candidate.

Without a stimulus package, economic recovery slows down significantly. So many people aren‚Äôt paying their bills and small businesses are struggling currently. What do you think is going to happen? Landlords are going to magically be able to cover mortgages when tenants don‚Äôt pay rent and can‚Äôt be evicted? And don‚Äôt take my word for it, take Powell‚Äôs since he‚Äôs the expert on the matter. And at some point the stock market will reflect the economy. It can‚Äôt stay oblivious forever. Right now it‚Äôs factoring in a huge V shaped recovery which probably won‚Äôt be happening.
The hurdle is too high
Yup especially with the rate of change that election processes have. It'll be secure at first but no way in hell will it be updated nearly enough for it to remain secure.
I don‚Äôt think you understand how our government works. The government needs money. Money is raised through taxes. Government raises income taxes. There‚Äôs currently a deficit and you think they won‚Äôt raise taxes? THEY HAVE TO. You can‚Äôt take in one billion and spend two billion.
DIX/GEX indicates otherwise
And they will steal Tesla tech for sure ! go Nio
It was a typo by a news network. They corrected it to 13k. The graph was screenshotted and is being spread to spread doubt in the process. Don‚Äôt be fucking stupid

won't stop him from running again and taking a large piece of votes
100% of mail in ballots for Biden in one dump is statistically impossible
Why wouldn‚Äôt he?

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll tank. Quite the opposite thanks to the pandemic. Or why do you disagree
Like the phone background
Republican Senate will block any sort of stimulus & put Joe Biden in a hole. Bank on no incumbent advantage when he's too old next time around = R victory 2024.

Market will keep pumping until election winner is announced.  That will be a sell the news event.

I need NIO to pump at open so I can sell half these calls at decent profit then have it tank so I can offload the puts at decent profit then I can just watch it and laugh for a minute.

sounds plausible honestly.  just gotta time it right.
I mean yeah the pandemic but people say there‚Äôs going to be a civil war of everything now. ‚ÄúOops stubbed my toe! Time for civil war!‚Äù.

Well take the antithesis of everything I just mentioned. 

Reality is reaching a point where REALLY obvious things are taking effect, as a result of how the world has operated since the 1950's.

OIL
CAPITLISM
RELIGION

Poor, stupid, religious people are completely immersed in a world view that makes those 3 things the GREATEST things in the world and anyone who says their not, or is concerned with the effect of those is EVIL.

Religion is fine, but Christianity has this flaw that makes people have to feel the need to Inflict it on other people. So, abortion becomes this dumb debate. Then catholics get involved and they say you can't even use birth control to lower the rate of abortions. Idiots. 

Anyway, religious people have to fight reality because religion is stupid and fake and not real in anyway. So, their brains mold themselves in a way to accept things on faith. This makes them perfect candidates for propaganda. 

That's where oil and capitalism come in. 

Oil makes the people who own the oil lots of money. However, fun fact oil and other fossil fuels fill the air with carbon dioxide and that traps greenhouse gases which warm the earth. When the earth warms it gets hot, which is bad, but also ice caps melt which raises sea levels. Neat right. 

But that all happens slowly and it still snows etc. 

So, if people are told "global warming" is fake and their dumb/religious then BAM they believe it. Because some important person told them, AND they don't WANT to believe it. 

So, they vote for people that also say climate change is fake or wont do anything or GO OIL. Basically literally fighting against all the jobs and money to be made in alternative energy sources. 

Which leads us to Capitalism. 

Since the 1950's ALL Capital  has been doing, the people who own the capital have been trying to destroy labor rights. Unions, minimum wages, legal protections, etc. Essentially to make labor as cheap as possible. Then Capital decided to move all the factories to other countries, why cheaper labor. 

Then during the cold war, the idiots, were told BOO communism, BOO socialism. AMERICA #1 capitalist is the best. Like tons of propaganda. 

Well we won the cold war. But thats because it wasn't capitalism vs commumism, it was Democracy vs Authoritarianism. 

Authoritarianism always looses, because leadership stops putting smart people in charge and only people they trust, which are not the smartest people, so bad decisions get made and economies and governments collapse. 

So, the idiot today, are under the impression that Capitalism is magically the best thing ever, except THE ENTIRE country is poor as fuck. Their wages suck, their jobs suck, their retirements suck. etc etc. But the stock market is up. 

So, they vote against socialism. Not even crazy spooky socialism. 

Just better social safety nets and universal single payer health care. 

Its basic math in Reality land that if you give a poor person $1 they will spend it immediate, if you give a rich person $1, they don't give a fuck and go about their day. 

You grow the economy from the ground up, and it creates expansion and expansion creates demand, etc etc.

We all know this over here in Reality land. But the people in crazy propaganda capitalism is best land, keep voting in rich people to vote for rules that benefit other rich people and literally hurt themselves. 

So, here we are. Poor people are still poor, religious people are still trying to fuck with everyone, and oil is still causing global warming. 

So cool, right?

But rich people bought some more yacht this year, so apparently poor, religious, dumb people are happy for them?

Next 3 months are going to be lit. Think of all the things he could fuck up before he has to leave. A White House eviction would also be sweet. What if he claims residence at the White House and they can‚Äôt kick him out for six months so Biden and trump have to share a bed together and they end up gay married? That would be a fucking awesome movie.

Regardless of whether he would be too old in 2024, I think he‚Äôs pissed away his and his family‚Äôs chances at future office with the way he handled last night and today.

Earnings will be great. Stock will be down.
If an earnings miss is not a "mathematical" problem then announcing the parameters of a financial transaction to acquire a company is also not a "mathematical" problem.

There is no contradiction in what I've written. It's not a "mathematical" problem, it's a new financial reality for AMD. The number 1.72 is a part of that new reality. There is no broken math here, it's just math you don't like.

Yeah he's not going away anytime soon. News channels have been making bank on Trump, so he'll still be there, complaining about how he lost and gearing up for 2024.
Shouldn't be posting this here. Remember everytime wsb is in euphoria over calls, and it's overwhelmingly bullish, you know your puts will print. Don't want to confuse the market makers with this info too
Funny how the market celebrated lol. Dude lied the whole damn time and fools believed.

Yes, however AP and Fox already took that into account.
If you do not have a connection you will. I read earlier lots of old people get it that way and old people love it.
He needs every remaining undecided state to win.  That means flipping Nevada and holding off the surging votes coming in late in PA and GA.  Trump led PA by 550k votes this morning.  Now 300k.  Led GA by 102k this morning now 60k.  The only remaining votes to be counted are cities and mail in which are heavily skewed toward Biden.

Hmm correct me if im wrong but wouldn't it make sense for the long put and call to decay quicker than the short put and call since they are further OTM? So technically your P/L on the trade would be closer to a loss this far out from exp and as the short call and put start to decay quicker than the longs then you would start seeing the profit?

I have never actually used an iron condor but it would make sense for that to be how it functioned because its pretty much just a call and put spread combined.

Yeah no shit but you couldn‚Äôt take a Covid pill and then asphyxiate a few hours later.
ACUTE is the key word
you're mad you closed out a position 9% OTM on expiry day?  Just take whatever you got damn.
Only if the Republican senate approves it?
I notice CGC pumping after hours
Need a QCOM type ticker tomorrow pls
What's the over under on Ivanka staying with Trump after he loses
No wonder I haven‚Äôt been getting any pussy lately, this guys stealing it all
Not going to read all that
NIO options are legit!
Puts 72% loss. Shout out to u/Xhafsn who suggested a put straddle, bought some calls and reduced my losses. I knew Prop 22 was a 50/50 so it was risky. This would have been amazing if Prop 22 actually failed but what can you say to 200 million in advertising. If this worked out Uber could have taken losses of 30% after earnings but it didn't and market also pumped since it seems real concern was COVID and not the presidency.

Next position: JMIA puts for earnings
? They beat but what are you asking?
Just need 1 more state!!!

Same and a lot of money was parked in Tesla and metals. The day could be way much better for me but I‚Äôm still grateful for the gains
Lots of boring small gains.
it's just never going to be. The risk is too high, the target too valuable. No system is unhackable and the value derived would merit foreign states spending up to billions to influence the outcomes. It's not if they'd be hacked but when and how badly.

I'm a software engineer by day. It's just not a good idea.
I think it will happen tomorrow but it will go back up again like it always does but we just run up, crash, run up, crash. There is no growth. Options are the play right now so you can scrape a bit off the top no matter up or down. Just make the right call.

How many days into Harris presidency before the country comes back crying to Trump? We all know Biden is just a trojan horse who won't serve out his full term.

Edit: Seems like r/politics retards have invaded the thread. Harris was called out for the most far left voting record in Senate and she had no words to defend herself. Good luck when they find some way to make Biden resign.
Please go looks at a map and look which counties are the slow ones to finish counting in those states.

That would be kind of absurd but maybe some minimal intelligence + education certification would help
Senate would of been nice but Trump has proven the executive branch has tremendous power. Immediately Biden can reverse all of Trump executive orders and then sign off on his own. He has full authority to pick attorney General, FBI, court picks, cabinet members, secretaries. He also has full power with immigration and more.

You are proposing an easily abused system. Don't even have to try and suppress voters anymore, just fuck with the weightings.
I think you might be trying to describe a meritocracy. You will be down voted into oblivion because that's not how democracy should work. It's a different form of government.
Ok. You could have just told us you were gay you pussy
They're consistent though
And Sheriff Joe to keep them all in line
With that logic republicans wouldn‚Äôt win a damn election. They get most of their votes from rural areas and states like Mississippi and Alabama.
Because he wont win PA
Volume wasn‚Äôt high enough to warrant a face ripping rally. And breadth is stocks down vs up and there was a LOT more red then green. Also if you look at the fund flow rates that was also down.

Just curious but why not? Is there a specific policy you're against that she has?
Maybe I wasn‚Äôt clear enough, I‚Äôm not talking about single family home owners. That‚Äôs a completely different topic.

I‚Äôm talking about owners of large multi-family apartment complexes, properties that are $100+ MM in value, something that is way out of reach to be wholly owned by an individual. No one in that business uses all cash, they are all leveraged. For investors, a default is NBD as the cashflow on the property itself is the collateral. 

In addition to the investor leverage, their lenders, usually PE firms, also use leverage. All of these loans (the lender and the borrower‚Äôs loans) are bundled into various asset backed securities (MBSs, CLOs) which are traded and owned by institutions. 

The Fed can help tie over some of these investors, however, the Fed has minimum leverage ratio requirements for borrowers, thus the property owners that will really need short-term debt relief the most won‚Äôt get it from JPOW. The Fed is well aware of the risk that this poses, which is why JPOW has been urging for fiscal stimulus since his hands are tied.

Which one of you retards hold his puts trough out the day ?
Show me the contradiction.
Yea sure Trump is crazy and abrasive etc. but at least he is transparent and predictable. 

It is like you guys forget where Biden and the DNC come from. 

Clinton was running cocaine out of Mena as governor of Arkansas and his operation even murdered two boys who stumbled on the operation. He goes on to become president and is best buds with Epstein, flying to his island 20+ times. The DNC then passes the torch to Obama who was a great speaker but didn't really follow up on anything he promised. At least there isn't documented criminal activity here as far as i know. 2016; Bernie wins the primary but the DNC picks their insider Hilary anyways. She is involved in Benghazi, and the murder of Seth Richards, among many other things. 2020; Bernie wins again but the DNC decides to go with team member Joe. 

Joe Biden is a career corrupt politician with documented bribery deals proxied by his family in Ukraine, China, and the Middle East. His crack addict son has for sure had sex with his dead brother's wife and there is significant evidence showing he has had relations with his dead brother's 14 year old daughter as well. This caused a rift in the family that Joe had to mediate. Joe himself has been shown on video touching young girls inappropriately.  Joe Biden has made a near 50 year career out of abusing his political power for the financial gain of his pedophiliac, incestuous family. 

It is absurd that people are acting like the country has been saved and evil has been defeated when both sides are absolutely awful.

Trump had pretty much fucked up the economy before covid hit with dumb policies, instabilityand trade wars. Things will go back to normal now. Stimulus will be passed.

Fully agree with this. A good example are the recent laws in Shanghai that forbid outside registered cars to enter the city. If you live in a big city, it is more advantagious to get an EV car. (you get greenplates, plus less costs etc)

China is serious on EV and will ensure they dominate this sector. China is already dominating the lithium ion battery industry, it is logical that will lead the way with battery powered cars.

Example:
https://mobile.twitter.com/ray4tesla/status/1323307146642038784

In regards to NIO, they differentiate from other brands by their brand execution and technology. An example are the new state standards for battery swap stations, a few of these are developped by NIO of which they hold patents. 

NIO is more similar to a brand like Apple, a lot of focus on the user experience. In that regards its really Tesla's eastern brother.

For that reason I have a longterm investment in NIO. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

they definitely wont, trump is already claiming fraud and demanding recounts in at least 2 states
The mink farm mutation is the most bullish beyond meat news I‚Äôve ever heard.
Yeah.  Rupert Murdoch has disavowed Trump
 No.  McConnell only gets away with his bullshit because he has a president that had his back.  When the country is waiting for the bill to pass pelosi and biden agreed on it all falls into McConnells personal decision.  He will fold.
Why would tech fall? They might dip for a day or two but why would they fall?

I love watching Fox‚Äôs Victimhood Club
It really all depends on geography and how votes are coming in.

In az, maricopa county (phx area) say if biden is getting 4 votes for every 1 the president is getting, and most of the outstanding votes are from there, there's no real way the president can catch up. Relatively straight forward to project. 

The % difference isn't much here, it's about raw numbers, and where votes haven't come back from. Make sense?

Look at how expensive the puts are on the other side, people know vol will probably decrease and, if not, UVXY is such a shitty instrument that it will lose value anyways because it is both leveraged and the term structure sucks. Look at the tracking error for UVXY on VIX and realize that you don't even know what you're betting on. 

Also, decent chance election is either called tonight or tomorrow during trading hours for Biden given WI and MI are called and he just needs AZ and NV now to clinch it. It's over unless Trump pulls off a miracle. Everyone just has PTSD from 2016 and doesn't understand that mail to election day vote is very, very different set of voters.

I'm well aware of the mechanics of spreads. They require a lot more fin-angling though and unit lots would just be much simpler. One issue with credit spreads for instance is that if the stock goes up and you're selling a credit put spread, there are no incremental profits. By the same token there is the chance of the stock plowing down and down again the next week and the week after. And then shooting up all at once so that what you recover is minimal.
They are delusional
lol poor Trump, stock market had one of the biggest days of the year and he couldn't tweet it's because he won. maybe he shouldn't have let the market crash before the election. common sense was to pass a stimulus.

Genuinely interested, you had 3 more weeks until expiry and were down so much, on top of that we just had 3rd day of bigly green. Risk-reward from my limited understanding seems quite a bit skewed towards holding, no?
So it all comes down to NV and PA?
Nope I watched his whole speech. He said he isn‚Äôt claiming anything as he proceeds to say he knows he has 270 lol. It‚Äôs insane dems didn‚Äôt pick Bernie or anyone else, Biden is literally a blue version of Trump, but worse objectively lol he does all the same bad shit he does
I know bro I actually got flashbacks from the start of September and October if u look back we had massive Green Days in each of those months and a few days after when everyone got their guards down we change direction and started tanking üòÇ like whenever it‚Äôs like 3-4 pct in a day I get nervous and starting to close my calls and say trade. Good luck bro I hope it works out for u.

Idk if you‚Äôre joking or not, but in the event that ur not...deep otm options will have a very low delta so it won‚Äôt drive up asset prices very much. Taking large derivative positions can drive up the asset prices, but it can be hard to realize your gains.

Biden is a career corrupt politician with documented bribery deals proxied by his family in Ukraine, China, and the Middle East. His crack addict son has for sure had sex with his dead brother's wife and there is significant evidence showing he has had relations with his dead brother's 14 year old daughter as well. This caused a rift in the family that Joe had to mediate. Joe himself has been shown on video touching young girls inappropriately. 

TLDR; Biden has made a 47 year career out of abusing his political power for the financial gain of his pedophiliac, incestuous family. 

He really is no better than Trump, he just isn't as outwardly crazy. They are both trash.

I claim 1000 shares of AMZN stock and I direct 10 of you to each buy 1 call dated 11/6 from me for $400/share.  The strike price shall be decided upon at 3:59 on Friday.

I declare this in the name of my name, and you shall comply.

Thanks!
Let's go fsly .. jumped in after the volatility going down , hopefully lil bro NET doesn't bring him down tomorrow AH.

NFLX calls !! ya'll forget their increase of streaming services!?
Most of the votes left in AZ are from Democrat leaning counties. So they are assuming most go to Biden. I think it‚Äôs similar with PA and a ton of absentee ballots left.
Potentially could be a tied senate, but unlikely

I‚Äôm not watching but something tells me you‚Äôre taking whatever he said out of context. But I could be wrong, again I didn‚Äôt see whatever you‚Äôre claiming

Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services.

Bad grammar. Meant in general.
PA is looking like it will go the way of Michigan and Wisconsin.
Sept 1st was a Friday
he simply can't help people who don't want to be helped.

People want more lockdowns, more taxes and more wealth transfer so the rich get richer.

Well I guess they will get what they asked for.
Yeah. Look up LBJ dude. Throw that shit in the desert üèú
Trump administration logic -

Stop testing so less covid cases

Stop counting ballots so votes will be less. 

Seems about right and legal üòÇ
why will income taxes go higher? the president cant do this alone

The article goes on to say that without stimulus, it is very unlikely that interest rates will be increased, and thus this is very good for the large FAANG stocks, plus Microsoft and such.

Sooo SPY moons with hopes of stim, SPY moons without stim.. What could go wrong.
More NIO

Nevada isn‚Äôt going to announce anything til tomorrow morning bud.
This post will probably expire worthless, just like my puts
I don't see how people keep electing him.  He's like an anti-human
It‚Äôs true, like a boxer, I avoid masturbation the night before a big trade. Don‚Äôt want to jinx it by masturbating to gay porn for 6 hours straight. Unless I have puts.
Other countries have to toe the line of pleasing their own people and their very specific and important cultural needs alllllll while appealing to whomever the president is in order to continue a solid influx of wealth.
The two he‚Äôs leading - MI and NV 

Or he would need to flip PA or NC in conjunction with MI
He's in prison for extorting Nike I'm pretty sure lmao
I think bc in AZ they just waiting on maricopa which has been blue for a loooong time bc phx

Unlikely, looks like were consolidating since Sept ATH with lower highs and higher lows ina zigzag, now with a leg up till ~ 350, maybe after 1leg down to 340 then up again,, when we break the upper trend from the peaks, new ATHs incoming, maybe blow offtop, before bull run rly ends..

hahahahahha, :( we lost bud...we didnt have calls... it might not be too late to grab them, ill check at open, but holding over the weekend is a must

FINALLY!!!!!
what stock
But they don't because they're fucking idiots

What the fuck does that have to do with the video evidence that was just posted, you fucking retard?

True! Looking forward to it

The system is overwhelmingly secure. Hes getting beat fair and square. The fact that he wants to stop the count in Mich and Penn, but keep counting in Arizona should tell you all you need to know. Hes just losing and desperate
Calls on mink companies now lads.

 The White House just called a lid at 5:25pm, meaning (technically) we will not be seeing/hearing from the President in person tonight

Yeah okay buddy 100K votes without a single mango vote. üôÑ
Genuine, unbiased question: How can they claim AZ for Biden with 16% votes still outstanding and a 3.4% difference between the two, but PA has 14% votes outstanding and a 5% difference between the two?

I am simple man. I see ARK buys a stock, I buy the same next day.
Probably will win it
Biden has routinely said he does not care about the stock market
Omg this dude really added a tldr like he thought people actually cared about his opinion
What do you claim? Your wish is twitter‚Äôs command.
which two would that be?
There's no way to know at the moment.
Wouldn‚Äôt matter if Nevada stays blue.
Why? They count a big batch, then update the numbers periodically.
Don't worry the only guy stumping out there for him is his son.   Everyone is deserting him like a sinking ship
Lol if you look at market breadth and volume it definitely don‚Äôt look genuine.
Just like Tesla, it might keep going up or you might buy the top. It‚Äôs a fun game.
PA definitely. Maybe GA.
Wait until their batteries get going. Very bullish. Along with a 17-25k car (depending on credits)
If AZ goes red so does the market.
Only the ones with misformation. Twitter disallowed retweeting
Tesla to the moon!
Just got some today. At least a double up once over the next couple weeks. Or maybe not
Dude fucking RKT never keeps it gain.

If we go back above 23 I'm dumping everything and never getting back in again.
Because of the counties where those votes come from.
Buy calls
Shit
Wouldn't that be bad overall though? Blue president with red senate = nothing ever gets done = no stimulus.
No. Electors finalize their votes in December.

No one can claim victory. Only times people concede is when the victory is overwhelming and the winner graciously accepts.

But Trump isn‚Äôt gracious nor does he know how voting works. He claimed victory and it holds no validity
What are your moves tomorrow?

Pray for tendies. Check account. No tendies
Not really if you understand anything about how an election works...
dude today was fucking wild
NGL, I'm gonna miss tariff man
Imagine being that fucked, like we‚Äôve all lost some money on dumb bets but he May lose his ‚Äúempire‚Äù because he wanted to be president

President Trump:

Thank you for your service. Now retire, play golf, and enjoy your beautiful wife and family while the middle class gets raped. You did all you could.
Every court is denying him & basically calling him retarded for trying to contest the election
yeah but cnn news man and funny talk show guy wont do the angry orange tweet thing anymore
To some extent, probably. To turn the tides of the election? Not a clue.
Bro even Hilary won NV in ‚Äò16 Trump hasn‚Äôt flipped a single state
Why did you do that?
Oh I know, it‚Äôs all about black women power now

The people supporting biden are poor fucks with a small shitty portfolio.

Those with 401k‚Äôs and large portfolios, along with LLC‚Äôs prefer the corporate tax rate to be LOW. The possibility of a trump win mooned futures to 5% yesterday.

I don't think it's that shocking that China companies are üöÄüöÄ NIO, LI, XPEV with new price target. If the market expects Biden to win, their cars will be in America by next year. Green is the only color that matters
They have validity after November (17th?) when the official count of ballots is in, he can then challenge the count
Oh my
Sleepy Joe wakes up the stock market

I'm seeing the VERY start of divergence in almost all tech so I have only about $1k worth of puts.  I'm not adding to that at all though, fully expect for those to be fucked by EOW and will be closing them tomorrow if we don't gap down tonight.

I honestly don't know where to play right now, the election fucked up almost ALL the charts with that bullshit pump last night.  Might just hold cash until things settle down and I can have some kind of a clue.
You know what, it‚Äôs original, I‚Äôll give you that.

Italy is locking down again, election will likely be contested, and virus cases are only going up
Republican senate, no banning guns. Most likely with the Supreme Court tilted they‚Äôll start pulling the reigns on the reach of the executive branch.
If Biden wins penn it‚Äôs over, trump needs to win penn and either NV or AZ which is possible but a long shot. They basically need a Hail Mary.
Scary couple of days ahead with Trump reeee‚Äôing out claiming the election was stolen and pushing his fan girls to violence üò¨
Stop it
Na he said if you didnt buy Friday, buy some monday,  buy paypal tuesday after earnings dump, and i think Wed after election if it dips

I voted for Biden ü§´
So with that logic you are arguing that rather than secure solid returns in one of the most powerful markets in the world all of these ‚Äòbig players‚Äô are going to cash out and stay on the sidelines because of higher taxes? Americans are fucking greedy, the world is greedy, we will play the game regardless, even if we have to pay a premium.
Haha true
LMFAO please tell me some of you just saw that guy on FOX who interrupted the press conference in nevada
I kept setting "Limit" orders instead of "Stop" for... a shamefully long time.

> Why do I keep getting closed out so early?!

Because I'm retarded, that's why.  The words aren't even close!
Stimulus will happen regardless. At the end of the day, both parties are pro money. It‚Äôll just be a smaller one that puts us in debt for 50 years instead of 100.
Good for gold

Keep in mind trump hired reince preibus and Steve Bannon to help him strategize his PR.  They're among the best in the world at spin and messaging strategy, and they both left because he was an idiot who couldn't stay on script. 

Even they underestimated America's ability to gobble up the bullshit.
A lot of the Christians for Trump are seriously deluded into thinking he's a Christian. Like at least 30% of his evangelical supporters if not more think that he's a flawed person but he is actually a Christian.

Jesus Christ this is an un-factual, circle jerking left feedback loop that literally hates Trump so much and doesn't even care about actual shit happening. You sit here saying how sad and what a POS Trump is while politicians on the left and right are majority corrupt. You only care about your narrative and you pat on the back of people spewing the same shit as you with up-votes, and down-vote any opinions you disagree with. Aaron would be ashamed of what Reddit has become.  


TLDR: Sub is 1-sided feedback loop, proved by downvotes xd

So, how do you think I should attack this, I know the worst that can happen is I lose $62, but should I try to close all at open? Sorry I know this is very dumb haha
lol Trump down 100k votes every time I look at PA.  He's going to lose it big.  Good job Philly.  I will eat one of your cheese steaks in your honor tonight.
my bull case for nio is I hope they come to US so i can buy an et7. That's a big deal to me, their cars look so much better in quality than teslas.
I fucking hope so
Man congrats!! I had no idea they were reporting today.

Dems rigged the election to underpeform according to the vast majority of polls. They're smart like that.

To be fair, Twitter is censoring news that are not in their favour and calling it ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.

Remember the New York Times post on Hunter Biden? Twitter sensor those ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I‚Äôm saying that twitter has no credibility
That leads back to economics & psychology which is too long to explain in a Reddit post. Demand & supply. If businesses see x person is in demand less due to controversy, that business will cut ties with x person & then x person will become poor & shun from society

Michael Steele served as chairperson of the RNC from 2009--2011. He just called the president's threatened lawsuits in Michigan and Pennsylvania "a joke" on live tv, with audible disdain in his voice.

I‚Äôm with you there brother
This shit is very much not decided it looks like. Biden needs to win Nevada and Michigan, or Michigan and Pen. Looks like he has it in Michigan but he‚Äôs losing his lead in Nevada with a lot of votes left to count. 

Penn Biden looks like he‚Äôs getting smacked in but I keep hearing that philly hasn‚Äôt reported votes?

Same trade printed after earnings in August. As long as the move is large, the options will print. Also, if you‚Äôre scared of IV crush, buy put spreads (Buy 12 strike puts and sell 9 strike puts for example). You‚Äôre buying and selling IV with a spread so it won‚Äôt affect

Yeah no Biden tax plan, vol is going to drill to the core of the earth when it finally becomes 100% Biden.
Trump isn‚Äôt gonna lose without a fight
420
Look at the sector that went up.

No blue wave, GOP retains senate = health care stock up bigly.

Tech is up for number of factors cuz growth stock gotta growth, plus less likely there will be antitrust shit now that GOP retains senate.

Biden is a centralist corp Dem, he's not gonna fuck with much.

But yeah maybe it'll still be messy in the coming days - but I think market has moved on and decided it's pretty clear on the outcome (aka uncertainty being removed).

Got it. Thanks.
No, there is not an official winner.

There is good reason to think Biden is the likely outcome. Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada are likely (if not officially) to be called for Biden at this time.

If Biden wins Arizona and Nevada, he's won 270 on the dot. If Biden wins Pennsylvania, I think that's 273.
I guess hoping for the American left to focus on the bigger issues is dreaming too big. I can't believe we're wasting time talking about "cancel culture" when we could be preparing for ai-automated post-scarcity cybercommunism

It has always been Tim Apple.
ZM and CRM pumped more than 25%.  
  
Its okay though, my QCOM leaps are happy :)  
  
Didn't imply QCOM would fall (I am bullish on them). But I don't think any hardware companies not named AMD can pump 25%+  
  
QCOM is still undervalued. Was my 5G play with XLNX and NOK (Rest In Peace)  
  
An example: DOCU is a pure software play and it pumped 13% in a single day that didn't even involve earnings. Pure software plays have a lot of room for growth (DOCU, OKTA, CRWD, NET, PYPL, SQ, FB, etc)

American housing market on fire.  All 3.5% down loans that I see, the other half straight cash.

My neighbor just paid $750,000 for a 1154 square foot house.  He has torn the inside to shreds and is now asking for my help to fix it up.

His monthly mortgage is around $4,000.  Taxes maybe $800.  Car payment $5-600?  Car Insurance? Fire insurance? Fuel in the car.  Food for him and the family.  Wife does not work.

I couldn't pay what he has to pay.  He did the 3.5% down and the all homes always go up thinking.  As long as he can afford it.

Biden wins

Dems keep house

Republicans keep senate

That calc makes perfect sense, and almost works perfectly, as long as you manually adjust the entry numbers to reality. The only issue with it, is it is delayed or doesn't get the IV and stuff correct when it auto generates those.

Stocks going down after a press release is not a "massive mathematical problem" for shareholders. That's a thing that happens sometimes if the news affects long term and short term prospects for your company differentially. It fucks your WallStBets, but it's not a mathematical problem.

The problem is a lot of small retail investors get steered towards deep OTM crapshoots or round lots on dead-end value traps in the single digits or low double digits. And those that don't still lack access to tools such as selling covered calls on a diversified portfolio, or taking reasonable amounts of near the money exposure to stocks in triple or quadruple digits (barring use of spreads)
I've officially decided it's opposite year. If something makes sense, do the opposite!!
The only thing that will make this victory better will be watching the non-deciding votes being tallied and Biden's share of the popular vote continuing to grow.

No fucking way it's anywhere near 50-50.
it will be up and down for months
And a doot for you too
Why is nio pumping after houra
Michigan got 120k votes added prior to call, 100% for biden, trump gonna go to court over this.

Yah. Actually a lot of bad news was already coming out on ANT financial but it never made it to western media. 

There were claims that ANT was way over leveraged and almost toppled the micro loan industry. Then he saved his own company by essentially dumping these bad debts to other companies and provide personal loans and favours to the chairman‚Äôs so they would take them. There‚Äôs also speculation that he needs the IPO to plug this huge $34B hole that ANT currently has.

Dem's didn't cheat - they've been polling ahead the whole time - and Trump is just trying to set himself up to sue. Lots of close races end up in courts, although he's doing it in a particularly Trumpian way.

Literally none of this is unexpected.
Nope, Az is done. Was already projected last night. No mathematical outcome to get Az at this point.

Disputed election coming - **bigly**
no way in hell Nevada is democrat, even with all the CA libtards migrating
Those 60m+ who voted for trump have stood by dozens of scandals which would ruin any other politicians. He calls your war heros "losers", has 2 dozens sexual assault allegations against him, paid just $750 in tax in 2016, has a secret Chinese bank account, dished out jobs to his family/friends, pardoned his allies who lied/supported him, downplayed the virus leading to 250k+ deaths, the list goes on and go. If you decided to vote Trump after everything we've seen over the past 4 years, you're crazy.
is anyone sad right now?
Lol sometimes you got to. I had to do a job and couldn‚Äôt look. I used today to get out of so many longs I held for so long at slight profits after being down BIGLY. So I said fuck it let him try what he thinks is a good idea. His thesis was Apple is up 5% in a day fuck that it‚Äôs heading back down.
Agreed, I bought 11/20c. Last time it tanked and rocketed within the next week. Wouldn‚Äôt touch 11/6.
No way Biden loses Nevada right?
Estimated 600k uncounted ballots mostly from Maricopa county. There‚Äôs a chance for mango man but seems unlikely
It‚Äôs ironic, Trump picked an utterly stupid and pointless fight with John McCain and continued the vendetta after his death. This probably cost him Arizona in 2020.

Trump is legit the closest thing you can get to a dictator in a democratic country. I honestly don't think there's every been a president with a greater authoritarian undertone than Trump.


You know he came in his pants every time he said "You're fired!" on his shitty little reality TV show.
To be fair he did push it but Mitch was a bitch
This didn‚Äôt age well.

Smartest thing I did today was nothing.  Just worked and prayed all my retarded positions would go up.
Biden should say "You're fired!" when complementing him out of the WH.
Large lead in Georgia? I mean it‚Äôs 70k I guess
"Somehow we won OR too!"
Probably will over a few months. Stimulus will be a nasty back and forth; but trumps tax cuts are here to stay as long as dems don't capture senate. Biden will be a weak president that will have to cut his list very short. Trade wars will stop and the printer will still be on.
didnt realize there was still that many votes left. awesome

You‚Äôre right, but 200-300k votes left and look at the counties that still have to report.

>Correlation /= causation

I don't think you understand what this even means.

>The people who just so happen to be good at math just so happen to go into math if they go to college and also happen to be the higher IQ people.

And this statement makes it pretty clear you don't know what the former means. The only way this would make any sense is if we were arguing that NOT having a math heavy degree is a good indicator that a person is NOT intelligent. Obviously, this wasn't my assertion. Regardless of their relationship, having a degree in a math heavy field is a good indicator that a person is intelligent.
‚ÄúThe numbers don‚Äôt look right so I‚Äôll do it myself. I claim all these states! I won‚Äù

You gotta be braindead to believe those conspiracies. DT knew he was likely to lose and has been pushing this narrative for months, you're just too dense to question anything your daddy says.
So many Republican congress/senate candidates were running ads that only talked about how they support Trump and that Trump needs their help to make america great. I wonder what those candidates will say now (if they won)
There's no way it's that high. Fox averages like 3-4 million viewers max in prime time. Most Republicans aren't crazy Trump supporters. It just seems that way because of how vocal the hardcore Trump supports are. I would say most are just lifelong conservatives and will continue to vote Republican regardless of candidate.

Hold it if you think their earnings will do well. I thought they might be at 45 after earnings, but if their rate keeps up they might be at 50+. These high volume buying sprees are running it up like nobody's business.

If you want to re-enter, I suggest something like May 2021 calls at the money or in the money. A large unusual position came in today for the 35c at that date.
I kept doubling down on my uvxy 19.5/20 11/6 put credit spreads all day and ended up with triple the position. But now have super high cost basis so hoping to get out for a profit if there‚Äôs just a little drop tomorrow or even Friday.

Not saying either one is necessarily guilty. But claims of underage rape at Epstein's New York home is one and how many times they've hungout and partied before their falling out over a real estate conflict. Trump had just as much opportunity as Clinton even if he didn't ride on the same plane. Just saying it's idiotic to claim one is guilty while defending the other.
He also said last week to expect a big dip on Monday, a big dip today, and possibly another big dip on Friday.  Still possible to get a 33% hit rate
Seriously, he could‚Äôve just shut the fuck up and let the experts handle it in whatever way and he could‚Äôve, as he is won‚Äôt to do, taken credit for everything and won in a landslide

Kind of sad I didn't sell all my NIO calls at the top today and reenter at the bottom, but its fucking impossible to time these things. I tried to time one thing by re-entering 11/13 40c but was shitting my pants the entire time worried about a pullback before earnings, so I closed it at a very tiny loss and got back into my 11/20 40c where I can be more comfortable.

Don't try to time NIO folks. It AIN'T worth it. Get your long calls and ride this horse all the way to the moon with diamond hands.
Trump lost
Fuck why do I always choose the loser lmao
It's not like the American people have a great history of following instructions regarding votes leading to their ballots being invalid, when when the voting was done in person
So how is it safe? Wouldn‚Äôt it be more safe to do it at the poll? Hence, voting in person is safer than voting by mail?
Biden wins Wisconsin. That was close
Definitely. You'll be a bag holder but at least you still have some value. Market goes against you and you get destroyed by theta and have your shit expire worthless

Trump had a lead of 480,000 when the votes were at 1.4 million in PA. Now he‚Äôs down to a lead of 320,000 with 1.1 million left in PA. 

Shouldn‚Äôt need to tell anyone to do the math and if the rate of decay of that lead remains the same, he 100% lost PA.

Kind of obvious after his campaign declared themselves the winners, they‚Äôve been premature ~~ejactulating~~ winning all night.

We already know you‚Äôre retarded you don‚Äôt need to convince anyone
Even if someone could answer that question it is pretty vague. I could buy and sell a call for a 200% profit that later expires worthless. There are some options that expire 0.01 ITM and some that expire 15.00 ITM. So a percentage of how many were "profitable" might not tell you what you want to know. Then factor in legs of complex positions where the position might be positive even if the individual option legs are negative.

Trust me. Watching my puts die when spy rose by $11.77 had me sweating. I thought I timed the top at 346, and I did. But that shit kept rising. Puts finally came back to life EOD. This isn‚Äôt a healthy market. And we are clearly in a downtrend. Doesn‚Äôt mean money isn‚Äôt to be made, but I‚Äôd caution saying that we are in a bull market. Literally the S&P was on level with 2/20 price action on 10/04/20. We eeeked little to no gain this year.
Rule is simple - green is right, red is almost right
all these bullishness on NIO in WSB is making me worry, maybe i should cut down my position... this reminds me of when people were uber bullish about reopening stonks back in early june

Yeah don‚Äôt see anymore gains since it‚Äôs one dollar up on the stock translate one dollar up on the option contract but don‚Äôt see it going up any further than $45 really over bought with a crazy market cap but then again I‚Äôve see crazier shit. You thinking of exercising the contracts or selling it the options contract? Or rolling?
So second stimulus won‚Äôt get passed.
Is he looking in the mirror at both of them?
Fox called Biden wins MI.
Posted my positions. There is some weight to it. I bought as it was still going down and didn't wait for the bottom.  It is looking good now I added some more positions on 10/30 and may look to add some more if it goes up again tomorrow.

Overall sentiment is that there will be more trade stability with allies. Since the aggression in trade toward China actually resulted in a net loss of American jobs, it may be a win more for companies doing advance supply chain tech from there. Removes uncertainty.
Does this mean we will finally get to see Trumps Tax returns

No. There was a lot of talk about misinformation influencing voters. Specifically pushing false adds/statements on Hillary. The vote was legitimate
Took much longer
You do realize that half the red states survive off of tech blue cities build. The federal taxes blue states pay. Without the blue cities US wouldn't be anywhere near where it's at. Have some perspective.

I'm hoping something crazy happens. Really went all in and now down 80%. Might stay out of the market for good now, no more liquidity.
Wtf are they doing? Only one guy counting over there?
Haha I noticed on low volume stocks I wasn‚Äôt getting any movement so I switched to nio assuming it would get me some more action and that fucker paid off. I sold my initial calls to lock in gains when it downtrended and bought back in when it started trending back up. Hopefully tomorrow is decent.

Biden victory is going to rocket the sky market because Dems want to pump tons and tons of stimulus with their Green New Deal. Its an expectation of inflation.

A biden presidency and democrat senate would allow biden to raise taxes = bad for markets

Looks like senate will stay republican therefore stonewalling biden's tax increases.

Lets just hope a republican senate and biden will be able to pass stimulus without endless negotiations.

Market is still digesting all of the facts

Biden was behind 700K in PA, now 200K. Looks like Mango man blew another lead.

They reported better than expected Q3 EPS and sales results. They posted losses but it was smaller than expected. They also reported that travel increased a bit in the quarter and they are making continued progress in their effort to control costs.

However, the uptick in stock is likely to be temporary because all the travel related stocks face the same macroeconomic factors brought to them by the pandemic.
I could give you a 10 page list but my main reasoning is tax law, foreign policy and a strong military.
bought QCOM shares not options. damnit
It‚Äôs more about his personal holdings, business assets and etc. much of which isn‚Äôt known due to refusal of current tax returns leaked via the times. May be worth reviewing who he has contracts with, from past tax returns. There‚Äôs no pure play here. Real estate is about to get whacked due to piled up evictions and other issues that have been waiting in the wings.
Wow we were actually right about QCOM
Dems thought republicans rigged the last one tho, didn‚Äôt they?
PA is probably Biden's after they finish the mail in ballots, it's an easy win for Biden
This should of been the title.
This is clark county were talking about after all.
I feel like we need Michael Burry to come out tell us dont fucking sell at this point.

For sure, I don't really like Trump's... uh, character much at all either.  Not presidential, obvious narcissist, just a weird dude overall.

But, watch the doc, it's eye-opening.

And that's coming from someone who voted for Obama twice, was a big fan of "No End in Sight," "Food Inc," documentaries, etc.

There was a legitimate attempt to oust Trump because he dared to go up against the intelligence branches / didn't play ball with them, and it's pretty fucking disgusting and creepy.
That's why NK is still building weapons, right? Like do you not pay attention to world news? Tax cuts for the wealthy. I mean if you're in the upper racket, then yeah, 100% I'd vote Trump too. And can't argue with the last one.

Well let's see what kind of tricks trump will pull in the next 2 months. It would be funny if he upped China tariffs and did other shit.
Especially since Mitch the bitch wants to do one now.
Nio had recalls too, but it printed for me 800$ profit on a  eow 11 contract call at 40
Hahaha no way a $500b stimulus is going to happen if Biden wins, they‚Äôre going to go for the $2.2 trillion one
Calls on ‚ÄúHomemade‚Äù category
Tax cuts for the rich maybe, as a middle class salary cuck I saw like $150 increase for the year lol. Literally abysmal for the lower bracket. And unemployment following Obama has been on a downtrend. Policy wise he really didn't do anything. I guess bringing back some tedious manufacturing job counts?
NIO blowing past $40 tomorrow mark it boys. Hop on or get lost. This bitch is just starting. Don't think about technicals, P/E, etc. Look at the volume and follow the trend.
Even liberals are deficit hawks. Biden presidency is going to be a disaster and then some other GOP populist will win in 24.

First of all, eat a dick for asking for no hate here.

Second, the GOP held control of the senate, meaning lack of increase of corporate tax rates via Bidens proposed 28% corporate tax rate or a Trump tax cut repeal, bringing corp tax rate to 35%. Big tech regulation will likely not be threatened by removal of section 230 protections due to Democrats wanting harsher censorship on social media platforms, as opposed to the GOP wanting either less censorship or a removal of section 230 protections.
-800 for Biden now.
Someone help me understand pls. Why is Expedia up after hours after disappointing 3q results

Certainly not Peloton, investors could see wide spread adoption potential with Netflix for various reasons, PTON is not in the same league, personally I think that stock is hyped up purely because of COVID
you‚Äôll still be under 150lb by Christmas
I'll take 2k% profit thank you very much
So you put 10k on Biden winning when he was +500 then?
Ya I have 40 of them
If the race ends up 270 to 268, it's going to be a real conversation. There were 7 confirmed faithless electors in 2016, but none of them switched from Clinton to Trump or vice versa. Instead, all 7 electors voted for people not running for president (more of a protest vote). 

1 for Bernie Sanders

1 for John Kasich

3 for Colin Powell

1 for Ron Paul

1 for Faith Spotted Eagle

These electors have a lot of pressure on them to vote how their state votes, and that would definitely be higher in such a close race. 

TLDR: Could happen! Prolly not though.
XPEV up 23% after price target upgrade to $34 ... that puppy is about to explode
They now own a brewery in the US, one big thing is if US legalization happens they also now have a distribution network as well.
Btw why trumps score hasn't moved one bit in the last 14 hours? . Will it happen the same thing as it did yesterday where biden was 200 points and trump 100 points and suddenly trump score skyrockets to 200?
Lol that's crazy. Biden bout to win it
Can we all agree now that Trump had just as much ties, if not more, with Epstein than Clinton, and if you claim one is guilty the other definitely is too

Nothing wrong with holding it but you can further increase your risk/reward by rolling the strike;  current value is 25$ so you can roll that to 2 contracts at $42 strike with the same exp date.  you can also take the original investment out and let it roll on a $20 strike

Rigging an election takes time
I see your point, but I meant that it shows the majority of people have more moderate views than was assumed. I think the increased support for him among hispanic and black people, as well as white women, shows a disconnect between some of the messages on the left and the positions people actually hold. 

One example I can think of is the BLM protests. I don‚Äôt agree with people on the left that brushed off concerns about looting, or said property damage was ok because of insurance or because people were expressing justified anger. I support police reform, but I think those types of statements push people further to the right. 

I could be totally wrong, but I think the left is embracing some messages that people find too extreme. Even without trump, I think some people are shifting right in response to what they perceive as too radical.

Many Trump tards have these same retarded confused sentiments as the person you're replying to it's bananas. It's also a testament to how well GOP propaganda works. It's all straight out of a fascist playbook.

1. Sew distrust in your own governmental agencies (FBI, CIA, etc.) and have one person (Trump himself) who can save everyone from the corruption and "make america great again".
2. Convince people they are being taken advantage of by ethereal "others" by de-humanizing them (the chinese/democrats) all the while playing up your countries greatness (nationalism)
3. ????
4. profit politically (publicly) and financially (behind the scenes) by exploiting peoples fears that you've created  


When you study the nazis you think 1930's German were stupid and easily manipulated. Now you realize based on what's going on that the average person is stupid and easily manipulated.

They are not neutral, lol.  

You should really watch the documentary "The Plot Against The President" on Amazon. It's free.

It basically goes into how he was attacked non-stopped by the DNC in league with multiple intelligence communities for years, all for complete bullshit.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMJ93LL

It's pretty technical and I don't think a single aspect of it has been shown to be false.

Pretty jarring really. The deep state is real and they did NOT like an outsider they didn't approve of being president.

Lmao I like volatility I can see coming at least. I have no clue when mango is gonna be on the shitter with his phone
Who here got no work done today? Fucking exhausted and so is everyone on the team, including the client
Welp it was a nice four years, time to go back to the same old dem/rep boomer shit every 4 years with nothing ever happening. At least weed is getting legalized everywhere. 

This country needs a trump Bernie election.

APHA mooning
Posted earlier but auto mod blocked it because the ticker jmia is banned on the sub. (Probably because it‚Äôs a pump and dump, and someone was pumping it here lol)

And yeah I don‚Äôt mind if it pumps more‚Äî I have cash for more puts and the cheaper the better. Plus, the higher it goes in the short run the harder it will fall when it dumps, so the pumpers are doing us a favor

I looked into this and decided if baba runs up pre earnings I‚Äôm buying puts I‚Äôm not sure what strike price but there‚Äôs no way it has a good earnings report imo
Did you buy puts after the worst week since March?
Is that mean 51 seats or 50 seats?
Put that on your wall and remember it well :)  I feel I've stuck to my values although at the same time I consider younger me a tard at times.
Naw that's your account balance that's been falling because you're a retard.

why tho? He's winning and pretty much has won already and the market couldn't give a bigger shit.

Wasn‚Äôt the case this morning. Optimism on a Trump win created a lot of momentum. That momentum faded as more results came in.
AZ and Michigan looking to go to Biden so they really just need Nevada. PA can flip as well and GA still tight
Democrats get rid of the filibuster then scream that the Supreme Court judge is a fraud and a fake. Wake up and realize neither side represents you in a two party system.
yeah opportunities to lose money
The Democrats failed to take the Senate and lost seats in the House. Even if Biden wins, the right won't riot and will probably gain seats in the mid terms.

People arent boarding up their businesses because of Trump supporters...
Switched to shares. I feel like I don‚Äôt belong in this sub anymore

Nah it moved up because they eliminate mango without losing the senate so more mentally stable president with the same no changes made because of the senate

Yeah agreed. You would think since they are generally anti-regulation that it would be an easy thing for them to drop if they thought it gave them an advantage at all in the election.

Already won to Dems?
Ah then I must apologize. That was completely correct.
Also those numbers are disingenuous. Obama took over towards the end of the recession. He was in office when the economy and market was rebounding. Any President would experience large growth because the market is cyclical and his timing was right.

It‚Äôs the same shit as Trump claiming that he was the reason for the Covid recovery after the crash. That‚Äôs completely false also.
My election play worked out pretty well, what do ya'll think:  Friday and yesterday I bought a bunch of tech stock on margin cause I was already fully invested, and then yesterday before close I sold 6 SPY 10/13 338 puts and bought 10 SPY 11/13 338 puts.  Total cost of trade was a credit of 900.  SPY was up today and I closed both sides, keeping a profit of around 400.  Made a few thousand on the stock, and had downside protection from any black swan election craziness.  I added tech calls after closing the SPY hedge and am praying for more green.

Some more info about the SPY hedge: max loss was around 6k at SPY 325, and the break-evens were 305 and 336.  At SPY 300 it would have been 4k profit, and SPY 275 it would have been around 9k profit (very unlikely scenario though).
A regular billionaire with a secret service detail? ya ok
Hmmmmm. A democrat getting elected with a fucking fake, propped up market like this. Might be a good time to buy put leaps while they're cheap
I don't have any QCOM but hopefully this is good for all semi's. Holding boatloads of AMD calls.
Anyone has link to that "I test positive for covid AMA" "can we kiss" thread?
lol, they would have been crashing by now. His win is all but assured unless some crazy shit happens.
PA because they still have a shit ton of mainly Biden mail in ballots to count. GA definitely too close. 

No idea why not AK though.
Nah he‚Äôll be fine

Might be some election officials holding out so special interest will pile on bids.

Longer you hold the higher the bid, corruption etc.
Yeah probably, but not this year?
> He levied Ukraine aid to get dirt on Biden. His collusion with Russia.

You legitimately believe these things because you've been [brainwashed by the CIA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMJ93LL) via a years long disinformation campaign through highly controlled media.

Watch the documentary and tell me if you still believe those things to be true.

>He packed every part of his administration with yes man, so no one defies him.

Well yeah, like I said, he's a total narcissist.  Like NPD level narcissist.
Not liberal, just tired of having a dumb fucking asshole "leading" our country
So I completely 110% over estimated the volatility of this election. Jacked to the tits on puts expecting what seemingly was the common sense move, but no. Three consecutive green days. And not just green days, fuck you green days too.

Oh well, I'm glad we're back to pointing our dicks to the sky and buy days.

Trump supporters, WTF happened? I thought the market loved him, but wall street says otherwise. yikes.
Picked up a AMD 90 1/15/21 Call this morning that is making me pretty happy in the pants. Probably going to ride that out for a few weeks as the election fears subside and people realize AMD is still a good investment.

Yes I'm a poor when it comes to options. Small balls.

Did any of the ‚ÄúBiden stocks‚Äù actually go up today? EV/renewables did pretty poorly today. 

Big tech, the biggest beneficiaries of four more years of ü•≠ all rallied bigly. 

Optimism of a Trump win this morning seemed to create momentum upwards, but that quickly faltered mid-day.

The whole ‚ÄúStocks do better under democrats‚Äù seems nonsensical considering current market conditions.
they don't care about being hypocritical. they only care about winning by any means possible.
Why do people keep assuming Americans are not prepared for Trump's loss? Everyone has legitimately expected the absolutely worst since months ago

Cause I like low taxes and less government regulation, intervention and spending. Socially I‚Äôm moderate/liberal, fiscally I‚Äôm conservative. 

I‚Äôm also not a fan of Kamala Harris and it‚Äôs pretty obvious that she‚Äôll end up being the President soon enough.

Trump is going to absolutely melt down when biden is declared the winner tomorrow. I don't think people are prepared for just how messy it will be. Malignant narcissists tear down everything and everyone around them when they suffer an ego defeat. We should all be scared of what's coming next.

I'm in calls right now, but I'm will to switch to puts after the rally tomorrow afternoon.
Nope. He will stay quiet until anything goes to the Supreme Court. If Trump implodes let it and stay out of the limelight.
Lets go NIO
[removed]
Yeah, that makes sense. I expect NIO to rally tomorrow again to ~$40 (when Biden is more and more likely to get elected).
Biden is putting chemicalz in the chia seeds to make the Chia Pets gay
i pray to god you are the one autist thats right
yeah no shit if he's dead he won't run.
Should we also go back to segregation?
I am still holding my calls for Nov 20 and Dec 04.

But I wish I picked NIO instead for this week. I could have easily doubled my 200 bucks.
Stimulus may be fucked for sure, unless GOP gets a sweetheart deal, which they might but we‚Äôll know more when talks start again in January/February. I don‚Äôt think McConnell has a vested interest in wrecking the economy necessarily, his main goals seemed to be SCOTUS and tax cuts and he‚Äôs gotten them. My pet theory is that Mitch doesn‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs sway over the party and views him as a liability. If stimulus checks went out before election I think Trump would have tipped the scale in his favor. They could have given the Dems everything they wanted and it wouldn‚Äôt have really mattered since they‚Äôd have been able to retain control for another decade. But that‚Äôs just my speculative take, someone who knows more about the party politics would know more than I do as an outsider looking in

Trump or Biden supporter it doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre all Americans. There shouldn‚Äôt be any violence or ostracizing of private citizens for voting one way or the other. Voting for someone is not a crime nor is it possible to vote incorrectly.

The politicians however are a different story. Drag Barr, Trump and whomever else was complicit in every single transgression against the country and hold them accountable.
So the Patriots are playing the Jets next week. I took the Patriots -110 and also placed an equal bet on the Jets at -110.  "What's the word for people like me?"

He made millions by pushing diplomats to stay in Trump tower/his golf resort. He packed every part of his administration with yes man, so no one defies him. He legit tried to dismantle the USPS the last four months to cripple mail in ballot. Like...do I need to go on? Why is it you Trump supporters just ignore reality. Fucking cucks.

Well in the way that you‚Äôre about wake up from the nightmare and then you have sleep paralysis. 

3 more months of Trump raging about results.
He won't be able to if Biden's lead stays over 1%. Even then, recounts at most will change results by maybe a couple hundred either way.

Won't stop mango though.

Yeah. If big box mid shelf (Corona, Abita) is a 5/10, Sweetwater is a 7/10 IMO. Lots of options that are usually executed well.

Uhhh trump would still lose in that case Nevada‚Äôs going to Biden

Election outcome is pretty clear.
I voted for Trump but already said I‚Äôm fine with a Biden presidency. And normally I don‚Äôt take the shit Trump says with anything more than a grain of salt. But Jesus Christ this election is suspect.

Are there any level-headed Biden voters that find it weird that Nevada would suddenly stop counting votes without giving a reason? Or the fact that the the states that seem to be the least prepared to handle the influx of mail-in ballots were the battleground states? Like c‚Äômon it doesn‚Äôt take a Rhode Scholar to predict that during an election in the middle of Covid and where the Democratic Party candidate is endorsing it that there will be more mail-in ballots than ever before. So OBVIOUSLY you would have more workers/volunteers to count than ever before. The fact that this shit is so drawn out is a disgrace. 

Shit is either stupid or illegal and the American public deserves some answers.
They are the loud voice making dems look terrible. The mayors of those cities need to shut that shit down swiftly.
Dear MAGA gang,

We may have lost the battle of Wisconsin and Michigan, but we haven't lost the war.

We need to keep spirits up and defend the line in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.

After that we go for the last attack to Nevada. And we will be victorious!

URAH! MAGA! USA USA!

You‚Äôre an actual fucking retard.  Trump did everything you‚Äôre accusing other politicians of but turned up to the max.  Ivanka Trump made $150 million last year as an unqualified White House employee at the same time Hunter Biden, an Ivy League lawyer with government and private sector experience, was making $500,000 as a board member of a company.  You‚Äôre seriously trying to compare the two?
Maybe people didn't vote for him, maybe they just voted against Trump.
Risk-averse
[deleted]
Likely slightly green most of tomorrow, probably around 1% or less. Everyone that was sitting out for the election bought back in today. As the uncertainty of who will win lowers (for the presidency and legislative), more will buy in. But Tech is still over valued, and without a Dem majority in the Senate, the stimulus will not come for a while. So we start going down on Friday, and likely into most of next week.

I can't believe the DNC didn't just make a huge play to get him out. Like find the perfect candidate, then pour a ton of money into and get him voted out.

Yee, McConnell isn‚Äôt passing shit. We‚Äôll likely only see bipartisan agreements on bailout / stimulus / COVID management stuff, tax items are extremely unlikely to go forward past proposal. Also feel good about global trade, albiet uncertain of how things will progress with China. I think Biden will be more hawkish on China than we expect, but that‚Äôs a whole can of worms and pretty speculative

If you‚Äôre the RNC are you even really upset at this outcome? They can spend the next 4 years obstructing Biden at every step while building up a newer version of Trump not riddled with brain damage for their ~~cult~~ base to worship, and then blame 4 years of inaction on the libs again. 

They‚Äôll distance themselves from Trump, saying he was a renegade or some crap, moderate middle aged white people will return to the party, and then they‚Äôre solid. Meanwhile the dems need record turnout to barely squeak by one of the worst presidents in history.

I mean a little. Why not just make money?
They distribute electoral college votes by congressional district, so rather than winner take all they can break both ways.

Nicer system than winner take all IMO.
What if there were two?  Would Trump win?
I would vote for him without question over the other options
Wait you can withdraw money?
Very unlikely

Based on futures activity last a Trump win would've been gold for bears. Futures tanked like 400 when it became apparent Trump would win Florida once Miami-Dade numbers came out.

did you buy those calls in march? (amd 50 call for example)
80 call options in total here.
70 @ 355 12/18
Out of control pandemic, still no election results, gonna be contested as fuck, no stimulus most likely. 

Vix: Aight, imma head out. -80%.
You do have 50% capital gains tax in Canada, right?   We will too now I guess.
Very true points. While the dems should be celebrating they should know this might be signs of trouble in the future.

Nope but once you lose you‚Äôre expected to leave the White House in January. Trump probably wants to occupy the white and refuse to leave, that‚Äôs breaking the constitution

Bullish on Biden unification messaging. One Nation
Way I understand it is that a worst case scenario was priced in like civil unrest etc, which hasn‚Äôt happened, so NIO 40 EOW
Why?
There is no mathematical issue. You've assessed the synergy as not worth the premium but Su assessed it as worth the premium so they proceeded.

You disagreeing with professionals is not a mathematical issue, that's your personal issue.

Damn. You were so close to giving an intelligent answer.
If you pooled the money from 5 brokers into 1 wouldn't you be over 25k??
Nio will hit 50.00 by year end as long they aren‚Äôt another luckin (which I doubt). Now as to how much it can run, depends on the month over month sales growth. It‚Äôs looking very likely they will have 100%+ growth for these last three months.

How do you think Tesla went up 400%

wednesdays close red, cause job numbers. then we open down then blast back up like all thursdays.
Puts on everyone you run over.
Realization that there won‚Äôt be a big Blue Wave in the branches of government, meaning that big tech/rich people don‚Äôt have to worry about a huge tax spike
EDIT: for those of you immediately downvoting me because I mentioned the stock market not liking the Biden tax increases, your own CNBC says the exact [same thing](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/11/03/stock-futures-open-flat-after-tuesdays-rally-as-traders-await-us-election-results.html)

Is what's left of PA mainly democratic cities?
At least I‚Äôll feel something
Too much stress sister
I don't even like Trump as a person that much. He's... fairly weird and pretty gross tbh.

But the fact is, American politics is [so poisoned to the core](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMJ93LL) that Trump was a necessary evil.

No one else is thick-skinned enough (and narcissistically shameless enough) to handle the constant attacks levied by all of the corrupt branches of our government, which would say or do ANYTHING to remain in power and corrupt.

You're all cool with Hilary selling favors as SOS? The endless "Pay to play"? With Biden running his little crime family empire via his crackhead son, and selling influence for Billions in tax money?

Trump has never done anything close to any of that.
Puts on baby daddy‚Äôs bank account

That just flipped from earlier today. Last night and this morning betting odds were in Trump‚Äôs favor.

You realize that Trump is probably having the most epic meltdown in human history watching Biden‚Äôs speech right now and we're all missing it.
lmao 'everything else failed', great way to put it ya biden rider
Yeah, but NIO makes too expensive cars compared to Xpeng and Tesla.
What did you expect, an intergalactic battle between robots and dinosaurs?

That was last election. Neither of them pushed any proposals this time.
If Biden wins, do you think they'll rename USA The People Republic of America?
So what does that mean.

I lost some money on rkt calls, but I sold for a loss and bought back in when it hit 18.60-19.  I live in San Diego California, on the coast.  literally everybody is selling their houses now and there's lots of buyers.  seems like quicken loans would be doing business.  3 of my neighbors sold their houses, and my mom sold her condo, she sold it to the renter before it even went to market haha.
Sorry I should‚Äôve said *more*
Horny. I‚Äôm buying more NIO right now
This is so weak i can‚Äôt even jack off to it
Joe's too nice. Halo had it right. Red vs Blue. Take this motherfucking shit to the streets and be done with it.
Just checked first time since 315. Figured we'd get some profit taking sour hour action. Nope.
The yellow line and the bottom white line is the wedge. The middle line was resistance now support.
Damnit I sold half my $QCOM calls taking a 60% profit. The first time I play it safe and of course I leave money on the table. Still gonna be good tomorrow
Divided is good for markets. Nothing gets done, wallstreet can get away with whatever they want. No new laws will be passed

If you haven't tried theta gang, you need to do it. I sold 10 AMD 75.5P a while back. Collected some sweet premium. Got assigned last Friday because the stock closed at 75.10 or something. Held on to the 1000 shares and it is at 81 now. Making thousands of dollars without all the stress.
Unlikely at this point. 

The remaining votes in Nevada are A) Urban centers mostly (strong D) and B) Mail-in ballots (also strong D).

Oh now earnings start pumping green after good results. That‚Äôs pretty bullish.
Xpeng and NIO?? Thoughts tm?

They‚Äôre pricing in a big move and earnings on Nov 10 is the impending catalyst. Don‚Äôt be scared of IV crush because this isn‚Äôt a normal high volume blue chip company‚Äî calls are being relentlessly pumped right now (as they always are in pump and dumps) so IV will be high. I made a killing on this exact trade the last earnings call and the stock dropped enough to make up for IV crush by a lot

At Trump‚Äôs face.
Check out what counties are uncounted though. Fox and AP called that shit last night, but it‚Äôs possible, just really unlikely
Jesus how much total was on the line?
NIO is going to save the world dude
Easy, one illiterate called a Democrat party activist remembered her 4th grade writing lessons before she got pregnant, and teaches another person to scribble the words, 'bye as in "good bye and 'den' as in 'den I will get mo money if I vote Democrat'. And so another vote is cast for Democrats.
Lol why
At least I‚Äôll have 10 shares
Tesla is a boomer stock now.

Will you shut up man
US industrial production still sucks. 

Needs to be way higher. AND A PRIOTIZATION ON ALTERNATIVE ENERGY, wasting all this time on gas and coal is retarded. 

Whether its factory farms or family farms, the US had a huge share of the soybean market and its almost all moved to Brazil. 

Im just using that as ONE example. Many other things were fucked up along the way. 

Our industrial "level" is so low, that a tiny increase, is a recent all time high. Compare whatever trump "achieved" to like 1960.

lolz @ arguing that the bad deal had to happen because it's the only way to do a deal.  another fallacy. (note:  fallacies are not retorts, either)

and too bad su, herself, already said they didn't need to do it.  so... it's not like necessity was central to it.

btw, you still didn't refute the mathematical issue.  what an asshat.

Mercadolibre actually went up after beating lol. It‚Äôs at ATH looks like.

That's been called for a while now. If Michigan and Nevada get called for Biden, that's a wrap. Looking that way.

Mainstream media doesn't give a shit about a Chinese EV company that isn't sold on US soil.

It's being pumped because [pension funds have been piling into Chinese stocks like NIO to diversify its risk away from the United States.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-sold-apple-stock-intel-bought-nio-zoom-video-51604003963)

[Federal pension funds may soon follow](https://www.ft.com/content/9bcc0af2-32fb-4444-9976-f3e7a2e20883) after Trump is out of office.

What a Bull day
Uncontroversial opinion that has likely been voiced already:

This is the best possible outcome for markets. With GOP senate and DEM presidency, there will be gridlock meaning new regulations will be difficult to pass, and with rates held low we may see an Obama era bull market run. Still, things hinge on stimmy and Covid getting under control. Extremely bullish on 2022-2024 market performance but until then we Rooing

Fox News called AZ like last night. I can‚Äôt believe people think it will flip. Lol
I don't know either. It makes zero sense but it happened. Heck, at one point during the day I was down as much as $4000.

I wouldn't say it didn't move at all though. It moved up to $347.90 and then dropped down to $343 by close.
No such thing

‚ÄúTrump picked up new voters‚Äù

You realize he isn‚Äôt running after this right?

Unless the next candidate is Don Jr., republicans are going to have trouble finding a candidate like him again to appeal to all the non political voters out there.
not at all, the remaining votes are A) Urban centers mostly (strong D) and B) Mail-in ballots (also strong D). 

Who's telling you they should be majority Trump?

Stupid fuck tariffs don‚Äôt work. If he really cared about American jobs he would outlaw certain Chinese products so they were manufactured here instead. A tariff is just a consumer tax built into the price. Tariffs don‚Äôt bring jobs they just cost you more for shitty harbor freight tools.

FACT: Set the ratio too low and Xilinx won't agree to the terms.

RETORT: In order to get Xilinx to agree to be aquired they wanted $143 per share of value for customers. The ratio was set to achieve that number. Any lower ratio and the deal would have fallen through.

Retort count = 1

Yeah I used to do this.  You need to implement a "think on it" period before you buy.  Like, think really hard about what you will do if it goes against you.  And don't spend enough where you need to sell immediately if it \*does\* go against you the first few days.
I see it as zero percent change

OH, i think its awesome Trump won, I didn't vote for him, But its awesome he won in 2016. He stupidity showed lots of voters how crazy the US can be if you don't actually vote and let other idiot people vote for you. 

Woke people the fuck up. 

But he's too dumb, to be there for 4 more years. Is Biden gonna be boring yes. But that's 4 years to build up someone to replace bernie, primary Biden out and get someone actually good in there. 

Kamala sucks.  

Hillary sucked, I voted for Bernie.
Not in Arizona. In Arizona early ballot counted first. Majority of Election Day ballot not counted. There was a huge fiasco involving sharpies being handed out instead of pens and none of the ballot machines in Maricopa accepting them. So all being hand counted.
I agree. For Trump to go away Biden needed a blue wave/dominant performance and that did not happen. A lot of people are already stating Trump lost due to his handling of Covid. All it'll take is  the economy going south or just lack luster performance from Biden for Trump to have a real shot at a come back.

Holy shit, I think we found the dumbest, most retarded person in WSB. Trump legit kisses china's ass lol, but no, to you republitards, he's just a businessman doing business, right? Hilarious how those tariffs that were suppose to "help" ended up decimating farmers in midwest. Yet somehow those same idiots who got dicked over still votes trump. If that's not retarded than idk what is. Oh and dicking our future? You sure it's not Trump doing that? Doing those idiotic rate cuts for no reason? Giving tax cuts to millionaires? Not getting a stimulus vote to pass? If anything he dicked middle/lower class more than ever. But yeah, sure, sit there and pretend Trump saved the nation. You're fucking retarded.

I started the day up $3000 on theta plays alone when SPY was $343 early in the morning. We closed the day at $343 after pumping up to almost $348 and now I'm down $1300 (a swing of $4300) even though I haven't changed a single position and VIX died. Today was one of the most ridiculous days of my trading life.
I bought tech calls today.  Who did same/different, and how are you feeling?

NEWR, NET, PD, ETSY, DDOG, RDFN (various expirations mostly early 2021).

It‚Äôs a faint shot but it‚Äôs a shot. He needs 53% of the remaining ballots in AZ to flip it and they‚Äôre mostly in-person votes remaining to be counted.
zero retorts.

all you keep sperging up is blind faith.  faith is not an argument.  faith is not a retort.  faith does not retort facts.
Yea but trump did none of it. Only thing he gor done was corporate tax cuts, temp tax cuts for poors and some prison reform. Everything else failed.
Thank you kind sir

How are you an options trader lmao
contensious
New traders are so traumatized by the volatility. They expect it to go back and forth everyday. Let me tell you a story about the summer of 2020. Tesla went up everyday, every mf day for 3 weeks straight. No red days. There was a glorious short squeeze. We‚Äôre gonna be seeing green üçÄ for Nov. Steady inflow of billions of cash sitting on the sidelines waiting for this exact moment. And all the bears either pure gay or just hedging are about to get squeezed again. New traders don‚Äôt worry. And summer 2020 bulls get ready for 2.0 üöÄüöÄüöÄ

I'd rather have dems control all or republicans control all. That way things actually get done, like trump tax cuts. Split gov just means we don't get anything. Like the stimulus.

> ffs, you don't even seem to comprehend why i keep mentioning a 1.72 multiplier, which is the crux of my entire argument. you haven't even addressed it. 

I keep addressing it and you clearly aren't trying to comprehend. Literally tens of MBAs agreed on that multiplier. Those people had access to far more detail and discussion that you do. Why should I trust you over them?

> no. $30B would have been more. $35B was even more. $35B while tied to a 1.72 conversion rate is INSANELY more.

You say insane. The professionals behind this merger disagree. They know far more than you do. Why should I trust you over them?

Only a literal imbecile wouldn't understand this and yet... here we are.
Trump gonna leave a big old log in the golden toilet in the west wing
So I've heard something today that I thought was interesting which I hadn't considered before.


Assuming Biden wins, republicans should back trump for a 2nd term in 2024. Reasons:

- trumps support isn't likely to diminish amongst his supporters

- he'll be able to campaign in effect for 4 years trashing anything the Democrats do

- all other republican candidates are boring as fuck - who will get headlines or messages out like trump will?

- if he's committed any crimes in his term, should charges come he can claim they're trying to silence the opposition to win 2024

- there's a decent change he'll be against an 'unelected' president (should Harris end up being president)

- he'll be as old in 2024 as Biden is now

I mean post election it's a hold right? You already lost out on a lot of the volatility from the binary event of the election

I would say hold through and cross fingers for a trump temper tantrum. But then again I'm just a guy that's down 2k since June.

First time I saw a tech stock not crash after earnings.
I don't even like Trump as a person that much.  He's... fairly weird and pretty gross tbh.

But the fact is, American politics is poisoned to the core that Trump was a necessary evil.

No one else is thick-skinned enough (and narcissistically shameless enough) to handle the constant attacks levied by all of the corrupt branches of our government that will do ANYTHING to remain in power and corrupt.

You're cool with Hilary selling favors as SOS? The endless "Pay to play"? With Biden running his little crime family empire via his crackhead son, and selling influence for Billions in tax money?

Trump has never done anything close to any of that.

I'm being a realist, Trump probably lost this. Let's assume his leads in PA, GA and NC are strong enough to where he can win. He will still be 268 to Biden's 270. He will have to pray for some faithless electors to sway his side. Michigan realistically is done for. He needs to somehow win Nevada but it's looking like the majority of the uncounted votes are mail in and in previously blue counties. Not looking good for DJ.

That's fine, we can take a loss -- if that's what it is, that's what it is.

It cracks me up though, people against Trump act like endless selling out / simping to China, a country with literal concentration camps, is a good thing somehow?

Trump was the one president who actually enacted proper tariffs in the US  -- similar tariffs to Europe actually, but still less than what every EU country has.  They were intended to help the US economy, and it worked amazingly well before Corona hit.  Record breaking results.

Before Trump, the Uni-party never would have stood up to China.

Before Trump, the Uni-party never would have had tariffs.

The Uniparty doesn't give a fuck about the American middle class -- they wants them to be poor and broken, because poor, broken people are easier to control.

Trump fucked all that up for four years, and the Uniparty basically [completely wigged out about it the whole time.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMJ93LL)

You want to call his supporters retards, credulously believe the endless CIA disinformation that has been pushed on us all for years now, let the Uniparty go back to wrecking the country while screwing you and your future children over in the process... just don't be surprised when it doesn't end up well for the American middle class, or you personally.

Yeah, I'm good.

I've been following Donald Trump since the 80's.

He sucked then, and he sucks now.

He's the griftiest of grifters and his only skill is he really knows how to trick suckers. 

That tells me all I need to know about Trump supporters.

dude.  the xlnx deal won't close until the end of 2021.  amd's tethered to it until then.  you talked shit on short-term plays.  (on wsb!)

you fallacied/hyperboled/shit metaphored about mcwendy's.

you haven't actually retorted a single thing i said.

ffs, you don't even seem to comprehend why i keep mentioning a 1.72 multiplier, which is the crux of my entire argument.  you haven't even addressed it. 

you just sperg'd out idiocy and fallacies without comprehending that there's a broken math equation at the heart of this.

fucking retard.

>Your "refutation" amounts to "AMD paid more than the market rate for the acquisition"

no.  $30B would have been more.  $35B was even more.  $35B while tied to a 1.72 conversion rate is INSANELY more.

hence, amd's stock crashing from 88 instead of mooning off the ER/zen3/big navi.

Don't worry, you are retarded enough to lose it all, plus more, then complain about your loans lolol
Never believe ZM
I don‚Äôt think that you do...from my understanding market makers are forced to delta hedge to minimize risk. I know when you buy a call with a delta of .55, the market maker that sold you that call instantly buys 55 shares of that stock. There‚Äôs articles about SoftBank pumping up the entire nasdaq through buying calls and causing MM to delta hedge them. Since puts have a negative delta it‚Äôs my guess (I don‚Äôt know for sure), that the MM would go short the delta amount of shares, which in turn would drive down asset prices.
It will pump again on news of Biden victory, guaranfuckingteed
Holy fucking circuit breaker!!!!
i just can do anything right now.  im going cash gang for a few days.  all technical are way over extended.
Gonna close my covered call positions. My smooth brain is trembling and I feel a face ripper coming. Also 70+% profit is pretty nice on election night

Why am I responding to this.
It does in America. 

When I talk to random people of random political affiliations I know in multiple other countries and they all agree with me on important real issues that deal with reality, we all oddly agree AND have the same basic facts. 

When I talk to conservatives in America, it sounds like I'm talking to a crazy person. When at the same time, they yell, "check the facts", "where are you getting your news", "this conspiracy, that conspiracy", "the libs are evil", etc etc.

I'm just stunned at how these people exist in the world and what world they really legitimately thing THEY are living in. 

I'm like just come on over here with the rest of the ENTIRE world, and there like NO, we like it here.

I never said anything about safe, meager plays. I asked why you thought you knew better than AMD and Xilinx leadership what should have been paid for the merger. You've successfully shown that you don't understand how M&A works. Your "refutation" amounts to "AMD paid more than the market rate for the acquisition". Of course they did, that's how it works. You can't acquire a company by paying an amount of money equal to their current market cap.

Arguing like a prick? No I was trying to understand your point. I gave up on that with my last post. Now I'm insulting you.

SPCE calls at close are always easy, shit surges AH and PM then trades flat or dips during the day

And you tug one out thinking about it.
XPEV on another fuckin planet today
Imagine not knowing the first thing about how the DNC paid consultants to obtain the Steele Dossier against Trump, which was used to obtain baseless FISA warrants to spy on his campaign, and then endlessly attack him, all with coordination from multiple "intelligence" agencies.

All because Trump wasn't "their guy," and threatened to cut their budgets, so he had to go.

It must feel great to be so naive and ignorant. I say stick with it, I don't even blame you.
Dump confirmed
if trump had MI and WI, like he was up yesterday 3% then the spike happened, he would have Defintavely won. Even without Nevada and az.
Nobody tell him
Yes
this usb the lowest uvxy has been since march, calls?
322 to 345 in 3 days yeah market works
looks like they work 4hr only lol
Now  I get to listen to the magatard I work with bitch about how rigged and unfair and fraudulent the election was while he quotes his research which consists of browsing a facebook feed.
if it dump after hours tomorrow will be brutal
Can I just yeet money onto stonk and not worry about it for like a year or so and go suck your mum in the meantime or smth? Would be great.

Ate some $cmg and knocked tf out good thing market was sleeping as well.. time to go to $plnt and burn it off good work today folks
NIU as well. Chinese EV plays going big.
That's why you don't use trailing stops. MMs sit there and make the price action ebb and flow, searching for those stops. Half your position size and double your stop, it'll lead to getting stopped out less often and more profitable trades
Reading r/politics earlier and r/conservative now has been a lot of fun. They‚Äôre saying Fox is far left media.

Wtf is Nevada doing? Lol did they just stop counting and go home?
dammit all the calls i sold are in the money, hope i don't get assigned
A chance.  The talking heads have been covering this pretty well though.  Most of the outstanding vote will be coming from Vegas which is favoring Biden by over 10 points so far.  Most likely Biden will pull away.  I think the fact that DPump's campaign isn't saying anything about Nevada is pretty telling.  They don't feel good about it.

I could see that I guess. I just don‚Äôt know how much it will pull back. It has ridiculous strength/momentum and finally got analyst upgrades with improving numbers.

most votes are remaining in Maricopa county, Phoenix area, so not likely
This has been a boring power hour.
Na not really, I just was looking forward to the tears of the far left and the chaos that would come with a Trump W. 

Biden win is probably better for me personally.
My net worth is negative and I‚Äôve had no problems...
That would be the ultimate lulz. Everyone looking at NV and AZ silently pulls out their MAGA hat while flipping off the rest of the world.
It‚Äôs been doing this like once a week or two. It‚Äôll maybe dip a bit but it‚Äôs probably gonna keep chugging a bit into earnings. Plus nio day in January. Probably actually have innovation unlike butthole musk.

i may have missed out from the amazing tesla run up (tho when fundamentals made sense as a speculation i jumped in) 

but as a kid i was gifted jim cramers mad money book.....i made some solid plays from what i learned there. over the course of a decade i made some decent moves, 5x my profit from a teen. really hes a pretty solid fundamentals guy. hes earned his money same as some of you, living in his car going yolo a couple times over. thats how he made his money, he was wsb before wsb was a thing.

maybe fun to make fun of a boomer, but he sort of made me all the wealth i have, so i cant partake unfortunately.....but look how bald he is! lol bald guy.....still rich but whatever

&#x200B;

keep this in mind : anyone can do well when the market is good, not many do well when the market is bad, this guy as survived in all climates, at some point you guys may want to consider that with the future when we dont have big tech 3x'ing a year anymore

Odd. There‚Äôs still an estimated 1mil votes to be counted in PA. 

If Biden gets just 65% of those, he wins it. I‚Äôve seen some projections that think he‚Äôll be 4:1 of the remaining votes there (80%)

I doubt it. Losing the presidency as a fucking president is hard to do. If he did anything better with covid, less divisive it was an easy win. He can't help himself and I thank him for it.
Erbb
So fucking boring, let‚Äôs see some action
OH man MI is making a big HOLE in trump @ss
He‚Äôs always having a mental breakdown on Twitter though. It‚Äôs his one place to actually vent, otherwise no one would listen to him.
Honestly had Trump not played into the Covid politics I think he would have won. In fact when it first hit, he was doing better than ever with polls from sympathy votes.

My guess is the house and senate will reach a stimmy deal rather quickly but the orange man will be on strike... so buy long calls late november early december cuz stimmy run up (not the one we are in now, will likely start jan), but for all I know this is the stimmy run up rght now which I missed (down 75 percent on puts betting that orange man hissy fit will fuck markets)

therefore fuck them
Good luck, you are gonna over 300k.

Yeah but itll be risky. Small cap companies with options would be the way to go if you're looking to turn profits fast. Again you risk losing everything if you throw it at one option

MAGA retards... hey, that's me.

That's fine, we can take a loss if that's what it is, that's what it is.

It cracks me up though, it's like you people think endless selling out / simping to China, a country with literal concentration camps, is a good thing somehow?

Trump was the one president who actually enacted proper tariffs in the US  -- similar tariffs to Europe actually, but still less than what every EU country has.  They were intended to help the US economy, and it worked amazingly well before Corona hit.  Record breaking results.

Before Trump, the Uni-party never would have stood up to China.

Before Trump, the Uni-party never would have had tariffs.

The Uniparty doesn't give a fuck about the American middle class -- they wants them to be poor and broken, because poor, broken people are easier to control.

Trump fucked all that up for four years, and the Uniparty basically [completely wigged out about it the whole time.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMJ93LL)

You want to call his supporters retards, credulously believe the endless CIA disinformation that has been pushed on us all for years now, let the Uniparty go back to wrecking the country while screwing you and your future children over in the process... just don't be surprised when it doesn't end up well for the American middle class, or you personally.

PA was their big play, they thought causing havoc there might be enough to rig the election.  It won't end up even mattering if Biden doesn't win it (which he's currently on pace to do).
In other countries, once this happens it never stops happening until there is a generational war, civil or conventional.

You're answering the hypothetical question that no one posed or asked: 'why you should vote against Trump if you fled a socialist country and fear unrest' when what I'm actually getting at is your inability to pull yourself out of your own shoes and recognize that not everyone agrees with your outlook. That what equals more unrest in your mind doesn't to someone who's been focusing on mostly democratic states and cities devolving into riots and unrest.

You're having an imaginary argument.

Not too late to buy in for this leap tbh, once nio expands outside of china this company will be 80-100$
In their basements
You don't but buying in after 5% is risky imo. NIO has beat that a few times but how long will it keep doing it? I'm just holding onto $35C 1/15/21 that I bought a while back. Try buying calls for the following week EOD Friday and you can usually catch one of the rallies.

Looking really well, im still holding to cover.  Their estimated loss is more than they were projected to lose.  I know this lil rally is just bs, I always hold thru the bs.  Wave channel hasn't broken yet either and is.still in the dumpling top fall.  I will be watching close tomorrow and friday for any signs of change in sentiment.  Never hold something on just fundamentals, youll lose everytime react to the price action.  Good luck
There was so many MAGA retards here last night before Wisconsin & Michigan flipped, do you think they all off‚Äôd themselves? Where are you MAGA retards?

I always do a quick google search of the company name for recent news, and also look at some of the newer comments about a stock on Yahoo to see if anything is buzzing about the stock.

I think once it‚Äôs reached 41 it will tank
Trump is done and you know it

Not even sure what the point of your comment is
He knows..
Maybe but that could happen with either side my main point is that the ‚Äúhow could you vote for Biden and own stocks‚Äù or ‚ÄúBiden will crash 401k‚Äôs‚Äù argument just isn‚Äôt justified by any meaningful historical data.
Beyond depressing brother.
I feel like not enough republicans understand this.
If they restructure the Economics curriculum in school based on what's happening in the market right now, plus the kind of trades that this sub makes, it will be EPIC

Hi, MAGA cult here.

If you think Trump is the "bad guy" you've legitimately been [brainwashed by the CIA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMJ93LL) via a years long disinformation campaign through highly controlled media.

We aren't going anywhere, as a by-to-by.

Me neither.  $200 in 3 weeks is good! I suppose I'm just "investing in the future" rather than earning money now.  Eg. If everything goes belly up, I lost all the $ in my account.  Haven't made (and withdrawn) more than I put in yet, and like won't be able to for quite some time.
That‚Äôs the only thing I could think of given the total amount of votes.

Michigan & Pennsylvania AGs: SHUT THE FUCK UP DONNIE!

You should really watch the documentary "The Plot Against The President" on Amazon.  It's free.

It basically goes into how he was attacked non-stopped by the DNC in league with multiple intelligence communities for years, all for complete bullshit.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMJ93LL

It's pretty technical and I don't think a single aspect of it has been shown to be false.

Pretty jarring really.  The deep state is real and they did NOT like an outsider they didn't approve of being president.
Are you stupid? Gun sales go up under Democratic presidents because rubes are scared they'll ban guns even though it never happens.

PA was already being fucked with by the administration and GOP meddling and they were not allowed to start counting their mail in ballots until today (I think Trump's campaign thought it might come down to PA).  Beyond that, some states have different policies with regard to how they handle the mail in ballots.

Everybody was in a tiny room last night without masks so...
I am put writing on this one. Going all in!
Correct and I was thinking I was sooo incredibly smart thinking this election for sure would be contested. However, buying puts on Monday for next week and this week was truly retarded. Everything I did for this election was retarded
same here. i'm actually still down about 3k
I guess, if you are very credulous and still listen to / believe the MSM -- but same scenario happened in 2016 so it's not like what they "talk about seriously" really holds water.

After 2 years of made up "Russia Gate", which was a completely political and manufactured impeachment, borderline a coup, it's pretty hard to trust the default narrative.  They did Trump dirty, for years, non-stop.

And even so, they were at least 4-5 points off with their predictions for most states.  Something like 7 points off in Ohio.
if i buy NIO now, it will tank and never go back to my purchase price. 

wanna try?
All I want from this election is Harris porn deep fakes... if I get that then I‚Äôm fine with Biden winning. If trump wins all I want is more cities set on fire.

Rightfully so. Maybe this isn't the right thing for your mental health. If so, that's ok. Pick a simple, low-stress investment strategy (e.g. selling weekly calls against spy leaps) and stick with it. You may be surprised at how well it performs over the next few years!
Bought calls on dip this afternoon, 12/20 320c
News waiting to see who wins to decide if they wanna talk about a surge of corona cases in some random town or not.
ZM was 320 on earning day. I thought it will not reach 400 on that week. Sold 8 400c naked weekly calls. Next day it mooned to 470 :(. there was margin call on my account. It was worst experience. My biggest lesson was Never sell naked call on earnings on any stock/strike price.
I wanna see 500 million trade volume on NIO tomorrow. If I don‚Äôt. I will be absolutely livid. WSB will push this company thru the roof no matter how good or bad it does.
That‚Äôs literally the only civilization in Nevada unless you count the scrub and desert shrubs.

next week will be the nex level
& Nevada is already basically Biden‚Äôs since all the ballots remaining are Vegas centered
Sell before you wake up to plus 4%
plot twist: eod SPY at +0.01%
Fuck, we're going to need another lockdown or some serious shit for the VXX to go back up huh...these calls gonna go worthless
Dude where are you sourcing your info Russia.com there is literally no plausible mathematical equation in AZ for trump at this point

This sell off should be epic
How many in here made a good $100k today? If only I held my calls from last week

Yep
No more stimulus is coming buds.
That‚Äôs like a 5k difference. So narrow. If either NV or AZ flip, we‚Äôre not gonna sleep well tonight because futures will whiplash us like a rag doll.

I came here to make fun of his 3k CC limit also.
It does not . It just that pa big on fracking so you would of thought that would of kill Biden's chances
I‚Äôm contemplating getting rid of my 40c‚Äôs before close
Don‚Äôt start this shit please
I'm leaning thinking trump, but would still think its 50/50.   Poor pandemic response and decimated economy is mostly attributed to democrat governor outside of Philly and even pitt was getting pissed off at the governor.    Dems have no economic plan for anything outside of major urban areas.  So if you left the rural areas and moved to what pa considers a city...which is a county of around 100k pop....you still have no hope.    A lot of the sjw stuff is viewed as exhausting....
Well technically no, but likely yes
Theta consumes all.

Accidentally sold for a loss with market price
It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútheir‚Äù. It was the dads mine, and when Elon his parents divorced it was still his dads wealth. When him and his mom moved to Canada when he was 17 they were poor. It‚Äôs not like he send them a suitcase of money. His dad actually forbade him to go to Canada. He‚Äôs not gonna sit there and financially support his divorced wife and disobeying son. Elon publicly stated he thinks his dad is evil and doesn‚Äôt allow his kids near him. You think that‚Äôs the words of a son to his sugar daddy?
Now run with your money and play again when you are financially stable.
who the FUCK is buying Zoom?
lil tay.  Is she still alive?
You completely missed my point
Do you guys think trump had friends growing up? I can‚Äôt imagine this cuck having a single friend lol

I use E*TRADE and it‚Äôs a lot more intuitive than TDA for options in my opinion. If you plan on doing any fast trading I‚Äôd go with TDA, E*TRADE glitches and crashes when day trading for some reason.

# what calls y'all buying today ?
Market pulling back but my UVXY calls are still dead af
You should create a spread leg to lock in gains. E.G. if you have a call... sell a call for the same date at a higher strike price. When the price moves both legs move and it locks in some gains. won't be a perfect 1:1

No one cares how moose are voting these days.
Trump has very little legal basis, which is probably why the market isn't too concerned about it. However, he can still discredit the election in the eyes of many of his supporters, which will do lasting damage.
PERMANENTLY EMBARRASSED MILLIONAIRES
So if Biden wins Michigan it's up to Vegas to decide 2020 presidential election huh? A fitting election for 2020
It would depend on the policy. I don‚Äôt like much of Biden‚Äôs platform but I dislike the GOP platform MUCH more. Combined with trump being a divisive cunt who uses the office of POTUS to spread misinformation, he‚Äôs a complete non starter as a legit presidential candidate. I‚Äôm tired of him.
Alright boys and girls, results are in I will be picking GME, CRSR, and BABY.F (only because of the ticker) ggs, you guys thought you could melt this account away I will be posting an update next month. Thanks for playing, I wish you all best of luck with tendies.
Look at the numbers and look at where the remaining vote is coming from.  Very, very unlikely Trump can mount any kind of come back there.  The networks are just being careful with declaring winners in the states that are remotely close.  They only called WI two hours after their election commission said they were done counting votes.
Lol lemme check my üîÆ seems like it‚Äôll be between 370-480

Holding to minimize the blood loss
AZ could also now flip
How are the puts looking?
Biden needs to trend at 2:1 of the remaining votes to win.  The stuff coming in over the past few hours has him at almost 3:1.  I'd be surprised at this point if he doesn't win PA.
Doesn't matter. Markets expects that, the only stimulus news from here on out will involve, "how much", and, "when"  as soon as all that's figured out, we moon but even if no moon it's defineitly not going down due to injection of cash.

Legally, he totally has grounds to sue. So much so that the supreme court is waiting tell after the results to hear two of them because only state legislatures can change voting laws but Governors and courts have been.

One of which they deferred tell after the election is.... Pennsylvania. 


Let's say Biden wins, it goes to court. Goes in favor of Trump, then Trump wins... Ducking mess

If you buy a naked call and are up x% but can‚Äôt sell, just sell the next strike up at the same expiration turning it into a debit spread, you lose a little but locks in most of your gains. If we are talking about different things my bad, good luck man.

Holding onto AMZN, which I bought more of at 3030.  Also 3050/3100 debit spreads (monthly expirations Nov, Dec, Jan).  

Hoping the election squabbling might throw us one more bone and see a drop in AMZN stock price to around 3100 or lower.  Doubtful, but if it does, I'll pick up some more debit spreads.

Can't see why anyone would sell AMZN to make it go below 3000 like it did.
There is no path for him in AZ lol
Its up because a) Deadlock Senate means no tax raise, no drastic changes to trade policies and tech regulations b) Covid case raising hence tech leading market c) FAANG had strong earnings d) Stimulus pump will larger and earlier than anticipated.

With all the morons bots from r/politics here.  This has turned into a politics thread in terms of downvoting.  Last night everything Trump was upvoted, now all downvoted.  The main difference is you can at least keep the opinion up without the ccp mods over there banning you.
You are fucking stupid. It's only for over 400k earners and for the amount over 400k.
Some places don‚Äôt start counting until after polls close. So if you want an answer Biden has/had the odds

Thinking this is the way right now.  The bigger risk is an actual legit surprise in counting the final votes in Arizona and Michigan.  But that risk is very small.  That makes different sectors rocket but overall market wouldn't necessarily be hurt.
Bears gotta learn that you can‚Äôt hold onto puts forever.
Contested election is pretty much guaranteed IMO. I don't know that recounts will change the outcome, but there would likely be market volatility if it takes weeks for the recounts and possible court challenges to be resolved.

Imagine if the market is not taking Trump seriously about contesting the election results. That most believe that it's much ado about nothing. Imagine that the market never dips. 

Imagine.....
The Senate kept Rep majority. No anti-trust for big tech. Green energy down, pot down, healthcare up tech up. If Dems won the Senate it would be opposite. So that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre seeing today. The market has nothing to do w Biden or Trump it‚Äôs about what happened in the Senate elections. Reading the comments here I feel like a mf quantum physicist. How do people not understand this simple shit. The presidency alone has no influence on this market

You have become what you swore to destroy
Depends on where the uncounted votes are. In GA and NC they're in the cities, which are largely D and have larger populations. So there's still a chance Biden will win. In WI, even with such a small margin, the AP has decided that there's no logical way that the gap can be closed based on where the votes still are
remember: poor kids are just as bright as white kids

Sorry, I fully think Biden is going to win. I meant, if Biden, a moderate who appeals to white people, can barely eke out a win against the worst president of all time, how would Bernie possibly beat him?

He's the best candidate for America but he's clearly too far left for America
He did..
Tesla was such a disappointment today what the fuck even
Not if you hire people to run the business for you.
[removed]
Just my thoughts. He'll probably hang around the RNC and play with running again in 2024. The problem is this was a close loss and a lot of people are already saying if he had handled covid better he would have won. For Trump to really go away there needed to be a blue wave and a dominant performance by Biden which in reality did not happen. From  my perspective he barely beat a lunatic mad lad that couldn't put on a mask.

> Biden can't win how the fuck will Bernie.

Except Biden basically has this wrapped up? I mean come on. Wisconsin and MI were obvious hours ago. I'm not even sure what people are sweating that some magic will come out of nowhere and decide it for Trump. Trump got a lot more support than I even thought but this thing is all but decided for Biden. I assume he's already rehearsing his victory speech that was written for him long ago.

His whole stick was for them to go out and vote, plus voting by mail was somehow symbolic to believe in COVID and being afraid to go to the poll

First exposure was on 10/26 and those symptoms started AND peaked on 10/29. Others in our office are reporting worse symptoms but nobody is close to going to hospital.

To be fair he told them to do both simultaneously.
No no he means he wants them to go back in time and stop counting when he could have won.
No actually. They lost senate.
It's the equivalent of TSLA spam
MAKE AUDITING GREAT AGAIN
I use RH for the graphs at a glance and have TD open in another tab. Once you get the hang of it you'll be VERY glad you switched. Amazing fills, stop losses actually work... .65$ a contract though is mildly annoying. But in truth you were 'paying' for those contracts in RH when they front-ran all of your trades and gave you shitty fills.
Hey at least senate republicans will save us from the 40% capital gains tax
who you think will win in PA
BABA before open or after close?
No but really bear bros, don‚Äôt get puts. Biden wins, stonks go up. Trump wins, stonks go up. Uncertainty? Get calls on VIX. 

This is not a drill scenario. Market has priced in all outcomes. In none of them are there circuit breaking sell-offs. Maybe a 1-2% down day where puts open at +20% only to have all gains lost by noon and you‚Äôre down by end of day, calling yourself a brave diamond hands put holder. 

Sound familiar? That was me. 

Stop it and listen to me. I‚Äôm trying to help you. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

Edit: trump win stonks go up.
Submit a request.  There is a short questionnaire.

No. 

Some polls were better than others and even the best only claimed they were accurate to within 3 percentage points -- but they used to be pretty good. There would always be 1 or 2 surprise states that didn't pan out the way the polls predicted.

They haven't kept up with either demographic changes or technology changes. 4 years ago they still did a lot of polling by running through the phone book calling landlines.

Maybe we're talking about different things? The basic spreads I know about involve buying an option and writing an option; I've already bought an option, and I don't have either 100 shares of SPY to cover a call or $34k to cover a put, so...
I cringe every time I see tsla retards complaining that its "not mooning"... hmm not like its $2100 pre-split.

At least it's not just me
Typically in my county they report voters in blocks until the votes ballots are completely settled. If he currently has 499 new votes we might not see it listed until it hits 500 or 1000. So it‚Äôs not that unreasonable if you keep in mind it doesn‚Äôt mean he got literally 0 votes.

Options traders don't care if the stock market goes up or down. They just need the stock market to go.
At this rate, if a meteor destroys Manhattan, SPY would hit 400 easily.
As it's trying to go down, there was a lot of buying pressure, once buyers overpowered sellers, they charged and sellers retreated.

Totally agree but feel if there is a deviation from this it would be on a day like this where a big deal (Biden win, senate stays red) is trying to get priced in by the big boys.  The big jump today feels like a new baseline, so to speak, rather than a bunch of emotion that fades sharply in the final 5 minutes.

I'm still playing it to fade, just not as confident as my last few plays like this.

I really hate CNN (and fox and MSNBC), but CNN has hands down the best election coverage, and it's not even close. They spend all night looking at individual counties and explaining trends and anomalies.

I flipped to fox and msnbc a few times, and it was just awful. So incredibly biased and not objectively looking at numbers at all. 

I watch CNN during elections. Then I go back to AP/BBC for actual news.
It's starting

There was a great table somebody posted over in /r/politics that showed the last 5 or 6 percentage points coming in and how they were trending (almost 75% to Biden).  Biden only needs to trend at 67% the rest of the way to take PA.
For the clown show CNN usually is, they did a pretty good job of predicting very early how this would likely play out even when the oddsmakers had sleepy at a huge underdog and from afar it seemed bleak.

Dwelling on missed opportunities is what really screws you over. It‚Äôs made me make bad decisions because I wanted to quickly get that money that I missed. It‚Äôs crazy how we feel like we‚Äôve lost money just because we lost potential gains. And then that oftentimes leads to us actually losing money LMAO. Gotta conquer some of this psychological stuff to succeed. That, and get lucky of course.

Don't you understand that Trump is divisive and his policies are creating zealots in both right and left which leads to the unrest? He is not the solution to your fear. He's the source of what you fear.

Michigan line removed from Bovada.

All but shows Michigan is a lock
Where did i once say any of that? You're projecting mainstream media narrative onto what I'm saying. 

I'm saying it's going to be a shit show because the processes are a joke and no one is going to give up. It already is a shit show. Trump was within the 1% too demand a recount in Wisconsin so he will be demanding a recount there. (Which won't matter if he loses Penn) If Biden doesn't pull away in Nevada and Michigan he will demand a recount there. Odds are if Biden loses he will demand a recount in Georgia and North Carolina. 

If Trump loses Penn it's going to be even worse. Already gearing up for a law suit against Penn Attorney General. I'll bet a suit goes all the way to the supreme court there. Where it's already contentious because of Amy Comey Barrett. 

Biden is looking to sue because there was a missed deadline to look for  missing ballots. So if Trump wins everything surrounding the postal office is going to go to the supreme court.

It's a freaking mess. We have been doing this awhile you think we would have it figured out.

I bought some $41 calls but 11/13 and 11/20. Mostly 11/20. The desire to buy closer to expiration for big gains is strong, but it‚Äôs fucked me before and I‚Äôve figured out that smaller gains that are consistent far outweigh bigger ones that can also take out half your shit or more.

It's alright, election reporting can be fuzzy. Individual counties report votes by certain candidates for every milestone. So, even if 3,000 votes for trump were counted they wouldn't bother until say 5,000 were recorded, but they would report joe gaining 15,000. Also, this particular example was a bug that didn't add this one individual county, who only reported their votes for trump on their local website, but not the main one. It was fixed in minutes, and the actual result of the election is legit. This "100,000 votes to zero" is just fear mongering in an attempt to pressure courts with no legitimacy. Trump is flailing
Uncertainty doesn't mean uncertainty in specific outcome. We either end up with Republican president and Republican senate or Democratic president and Republican senate. Both those options are good for the market

Wonder if this pump will hold. Up about 50% on puts. Thinking about taking gainz eod ü§î
wow i lost 1k from QQQ and NIO puts
37k?  With 20% of Detroit votes still coming.
Are they even counting the votes out there? I feel like the numbers haven't changed all day

This is like people who were nervous about WI.. they shouldn't be. What's left to be counted should heavily favor Biden.. people getting their shorts in a twist so they can celebrate afterwords as if it were a stressful time or some hard fought victory.
Get ready for the whining
Yeah, it honestly often feels like with some of the shit he says that he‚Äôs trying to lose the election. I mean JFC it would be so much easier to vote for him if he held back just a little bit on some of the stupid things he says. I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs why some people like him though.

The question is who the fuck would that populist candidate be? Like, maybe a former NFL player? I can‚Äôt see the GOP winning with someone like ted cruz, ben sasse, pence etc. as a nominee. They‚Äôd lose a ton of those rural voters that make up Trump‚Äôs base.
Lmaooooo ok. Meal team 6 and the fatties?

I really need to get that PDT restriction lifted because I'm really good at timing moves/reversals and the like but due to PDT restrictions I'm condemned to watch +30% moves evaporate to -50% losses by the next market open
Trump scheduling his talk after hours can only mean that he‚Äôs gonna make it dump

What are you talking about? Did you even read my comment? I was commenting  that the post I was replying to was pushing the ‚Äúall time high positives‚Äù narrative.

Wait. When is earnings. I‚Äôm full retard right now if earnings are tomorrow.
Wat da fuq
can I collect my betting winnings yet there's nothing left to do
I'd say easiest would be Michigan and Nevada. Nevada has majorly 2 counties remaining to count, including Vegas; and both are heavily democratics. Same in Michigan.
Such a mature attitude.  So many want others to suffer just because they suffered.
Oh yep you‚Äôre right that‚Äôs a better way of saying that

NIOs a china pump scam.
Oh, I see. PA would be the silver bullet, but then again it will probably be the last state to count votes so really if biden holds leads in michigan and nevada it's all over before pa even comes in.
The difference between the common retard and the market maker is as follows:

The common retard thinks the market is wrong and they‚Äôre right. They will do a bunch of calculations and stubbornly hold onto losing trades. 

The market maker knows that the market is always right. 

If you‚Äôre losing money for any reason, you‚Äôre wrong.

Guys relax seriously. I bought spy puts, your calls are safe, I've lost about 20 straight trades now
You ride'n on Biden.
I thought so too, this was very disappointing to say the least.
8,000 vote difference makes people nervous.
That's the same argument made by socialists in Latin America before gaining power, word for word.

Look you may be right, but it doesn't seem like you're able to pull yourself out of your perspective and entertain the idea that all of your presumptions may not be correct. That's the definition of a zealot - something people from many socialist countries, those few successful ones notwithstanding, have a lot of experience with. You have no proof one way or the other as nothing has been executed. Everyone intended on the best iteration of socialism yet few were successful. No one goes into socialism hoping for Venezuela or Cuba but Venezuela's and Cuba's still happen.

Doubt is a useful tool to analyze the world and realize that you too have bias, just like everyone else.
wall street did not fund trump because he had enough money and didn‚Äôt need the money for his campaign, plus he stated how if he took money from these companies he would owe them something and he would be compromised, share both sides of the story
This could‚Äôve been a landslide for Dems if they chose Andrew Yang. Populist choices always win but the establishment won‚Äôt let them in
Ah fuck, is it happening?

No this is dumb, especially for where amd is at right now

edit: you dumbass fuckers literally buy shit high and sell it at the bottom, i thought it was just a joke. AMD has been dumping for a month straight and you degenerates are telling him to sell at the first sign of an uptick?
Is this the dump?
I mean it pretty much is though.
I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt find a candidate who isn‚Äôt too far to the left and isn‚Äôt unlikeable to run for president.  It should not be this hard.
what the fuck do i do? my 11/6 puts are down like 80% anyway, but if i pull out now, we will crash to $320 eod i guaran-fucking-tee it

If ur all in, i agree. You can now make 2-5 more of the same option.

However if ur calls are less than 50% of your plays, just ride the wave. Many stocks arent even back to what they were a week ago. 

If ur doing a weekly, then ofc you fucking sell. If anyone of you retards are holding a 11/6 option, sell unless youre already ITM then it *might* be worth the risk

Don‚Äôt forget socialist fascists
Paranoid Democrats will buy guns if Biden wins expecting there to be unrest
MMs don‚Äôt even want to take profit LOL

Most likely blue, everyone from California moved there
we changed that to NIO
there's a good chance that it's over, but who knows its 2020
Nice
It's not contested.
I really hope that there is a turnaround and Michael Burry gets elected and uses the 2,5 trillion stimulus to pump GME and squeeze it for us.
The fact that its not already a Biden win is super bullish for Trump.
We're wise but not knowledgeable.
Those were some quick bucks on NIO puts. lol
Normally I would agree but Wall Street backed Biden big time $. The taxes would suck but they‚Äôre willing to offset for a larger stim and a gridlock between the senate

Lol at pretending the markets are that smart.
YES go for it.
its just proof that your theories are incorrect. people with more money than you have done a lot more thinking about this situation
Msft never disappoints üòÄ
Can anyone explain this to a retard like me
[deleted]
No
Seriously lol
Yes thats why he already said hes going to take it to court.
my nio calls r fuk. idk why i keep coming back here. i told myself i'd take a break after so many losses last month
fk yea
I'm bearish, but 270 ain't happening without lockdown or big riots
the worst people
Only one people is saying that, and only because he's losing. Market doesn't care what some loser says when it's completely contrary to the facts.
Nio volume is like 100 mil more then their average
So every single trump supporter voted in person
i voted for biden
Disagree. We will now have a stable president who is both a corporatist and a globalist so bye-bye tariffs. With a Republican Senate, there will also be no raising of the capital gains tax. This is actually the ideal outcome for the street.
DEPRESSION!
Bad idea to only just get into Nio now? I'm waiting for an entry point that may never come.
Msft never disappoints üòÄ
It really is. Maybe people actually have the decency to not vote for Biden and his crime family? maybe they want Trump to continue his fight against human trafficking or his goal to stop the endless wars?

What racist outlines a plan to help the black community (Platinum plan) and yet his supporters still voted for him, go figure. No..Trump is a racist and anyone who votes for him is a racist, what a twisted world we live in. very sad indeed.
It won‚Äôt affect you.
It's unlikely, but not imposible. I hope it doesn't happen and stonks continue going up anyways, because I need my retarded positions to print so I can finally leave my job at Wendy's and take some good vacation with my shemale wife and her furry dinasour boyfriend that sometimes actually eats her.

Genius, you can just swerve into oncoming traffic if the trade goes wrong.
‚ÄúSlight‚Äù meaning doubling cApital gains tax aka what we make from stocks, and increasing federal tax rate by 1.5x?
The lawsuits have begun, contested election. How hasn't the market responded yet?
Chinese stocks might go up. The only reason stocks are going up right now is because the senate is red

How?
Buy into NIO now while it dipped ü¶å
i have a good feeling they will (assuming biden wins)
That‚Äôs what I did 

Proceeded to lose $3,200 on 0 days lol
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ bro you salty or what? I don't care what you do or say this is an internet forum retard
I've never betted before, but my bookie is paying 1.28x on Biden. Should I YOLO $600? I'll spend the profit on a hooker.
I'll do it if it's "literally free money"
It‚Äôs like betting on who wins the elections. If Donnie wins then it gonna drop back below 30$
I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre Democrat or republican, the worst types of people are the ones that take up study space in the library but just sit in their phones the whole time
Lol market isn‚Äôt dropping for shit
Why?
Just went all in roth ira on OTM  spy puts one week out
This one
Thats my main concern. Lots of ppl will be taking profits regardless of results. But im planning on holding nio long term so not too worried
NIO: Hold my bags.
Any chance at Nevada turning red? Looks close rn. If he can flip nevada and keep his current states (even losing michigan) he can still pull out a W
Trump clawing back in MI. He rang Putin.
[deleted]
it doesn't
FDX is strangely red today and almost down 1% which is relatively big for FDX.
So what worse outcome was the market pricing in that didn‚Äôt happen? Election is close and contested, and Trump is mad. Isn‚Äôt this the exact case the market was dumping for prior to election?
Randomly ? Lol what a snowflake. He told his base to vote in person and not use mail in voting. His base are brainless individuals that do as their master tells them.
yes the republican money probably pulling out
Thanks for the advice everyone
Nevada isn‚Äôt reporting any more today sadly
There's 5 states left and Trump would have to win 4 of them. Isn't it over?

Lol this rally can't continue...this is going to be the most controversial election of all time. 270-269
If you hold, you're fine 

Should have doubled down when it hit 18
Yuhhhh
AH YES the wall street big people who don‚Äôt want trump who will cut taxes and pump money into businesses, they want biden who will raise tax and not care about the market
Yeah. But it gonna jump and dump like 6 times...and that‚Äôs how I cash out. Volatility.
maybe at 350
If Biden wins MI and NV, then he becomes president. NV looking close though

Why are stocks pumping, this is looking more and more like worst case scenario. Biden winning without senate, means Republicans are basically guaranties to put sticks in the wheels and stop stimulus, so they can later blame Joe Biden for fucking this up. Trump can literally go all lame mad donald duck and stop stimulus. Oil stocks pumping today with Biden winning? Short oil like hell.
Lmao I know I shouldn‚Äôt be that worried since I‚Äôm not losing anything, but the FOMO is building up right about now
not yoloing or anything hah, whatever just a play
Good
They had a seizure after biden won
Buy every CRSR dip until $50
this gme short squeeze better happen u fuckers , 4K life savings in @13
Doesn‚Äôt matter who wins the presidency now that republicans won seats in congress and the senate. Biden tax plan won‚Äôt pass.
I know, but election news is taking over every media outlet so there isn't as much panic over covid. I'm wondering if it'll be something new after the election or if we'll start seeing more a more negative market when there's nothing else to report on.

Sir, you appear to have been auto-corrected. Yolo GME calls is what you meant to say, I am sure.
I don‚Äôt believe it for a second
Buying CRSR at 24.5 only to sell it 15min later at 23 on friday might have been my biggest mistake
hearing news about weed legalization, wouldn't this be good time to get some dank calls?
A recount
Bro I think you are wayyy late. 
Good luck tho I hope not!
WE GOT WI GUYS
What makes u think that? And Nio is dropping after earnings me think
Imagine selling$AMZN calls yesterday worried about IV crush ü§°
McCain may have died. But he still found a way to fuck Donnie in the ass. Arizona has cost Trump the presidency.
Book lines are adjusted to balance book payouts, basically. Track sentiment way more than reality.

Pretty easy to explain this one, lot of emotional responses late with Trump up big in WI/MI/PA so betting pours in on the high payout Trump lines, books adjust to pay out less/direct bets to Biden.

Basically if you bought the dip on Biden last night you'd have a 5 or 6 bagger now lmao
Im here to solely shit post , and be shit posted at :( ITS MY SAFE SPACE still the best politics thread on site.
Good Job Dood
Good for you brother. I had the the chance of paying off my debt but because of the COVID forbearance and the possibility of a democratic president I decided to invest the money instead and bank on a possible loan forgiveness. If it happens then my bet pays off, if not then oh well.
I meant that Biden can win without pa so it's not really relevant if he loses it
If Republicans win the Senate and Biden the WH, passing a stimulus will be difficult because McConnell will want to fuck Biden at the expense of the economy.
You‚Äôd win like $1 lol
Wins PA and either NV or AZ, assuming he keeps GA which looks he will
zm 500 call for this friday is extremely cheap.... only 2.4 a contract.... hm....
NC, PA, NV, AZ, GA
Going welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!
Yea but uncounted votes are all mail-in and largely blue counties. Donnie would need a miracle to come from behind in NV.

why we mooning? cuz the senate might still be republican and will halt the capital gains tax hike from a biden administration?
Nebraska's state legislature is >60% Republican. 

Think if they pass a quick state constitutional amendment giving all electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, it'd fly before January?
Lol this market doesn‚Äôt care about a contested election one bit
Looks like Republicans will hold the senate and actually flipped a few house seats, which means there will probably not be any significant increases in taxes for at least 2 years. We'll probably get a little more stimulus, but I would hope the Republicans would finally start showing some financial restraint like they're elected to do and resist excessive increases in stimulus and allow this crack economy to experience some withdraws.

For some reason Republicans only seem to do their job when they are the minority party and hold congress, like Gingrich in the 90s. Then a Republican wins the whitehouse and they start spending like fukking morons.
You're gonna win like 5% over what you put in
Proof or ban

Trumps Twitter is not the most reliable cmon now
It looks like nio has peaked, heading back to 25
You know there are people that vote based off of only the candidates policies right? Yeah Trump is an idiot. But I agree with most of his policies. I simply look at the policies of both candidates. I agree with some of Joe‚Äôs and some of Trumps. Simply agreed with more of Trumps in the end and so he got my vote. 

If you think Trump is a fascist/racist you‚Äôre too liberal. If you think Joe is a socialist you‚Äôre too conservative.
Feels like if 345 breaks it‚Äôs a straight shot to hell.
I didn't vote for QPQJoe, but if the market goes up 2.5% every day while he is president I will 110% be on board with communism in America. Bring on the fucking nuggets.

im up $100 but going to fade to red in this greenest day lol
Just realized uncertainty is vastly removed if Biden is elected bc he's more risk averse than Trump. The market loves reduced risk. And with zero rates for years, brrrrrrr market remains. In a strange way, Biden might actually be good for the markets even with a slight tax hike

Trump ain't going away. He's gonna make sure politics is inserted into everything.
Just the mental gymnastics to be like "Okay God created everything, including medicine, but I'm not going to use the tools God has given society because I... worship God?"

There‚Äôs a few idiots from plumber gang crying about how new tax bracket gonna effect them but otherwise yeah
Ah I remember when Clinton falsely claimed to win the election and attempted to stop vote counting in swing states

Oh wait
One thing that I've heard is that black people statistically want more police presence in their neighborhoods, which contrasts with some of the sentiment on the left and BLM. I think Democrats might be assuming that people of color would unite against Trump's racism, but not accounting for some of the actual policy positions people hold.

State senates reject the idea. It‚Äôs not like California where they hire a third party to map out districts. Have you seen the Forth Worth district in Texas?? It‚Äôs because they want to keep the state red. In reality Texas is blue but gerrymandering keeps it from changing

both parties lose every other election so idk what‚Äôs ur point
So close to buying NIO 45c 11/20 lol

White nationalist Richard Spencer endorsed Biden. I don‚Äôt think Trump has some monopoly on the racist vote.
Why?
Were polls pre-2016 also this inaccurate? I wasn't in the US then so I don't remember. But it's incredible that "A+" rated polls by 538 in WI as recent as last week had Joe up SEVENTEEN %, yet we're talking about a <1% margin of victory. All betting sites had Dems favorite for a clean sweep yet Biden is winning swing states by <0.5% and the Dems are nowhere near winning the senate majority
For once, I'd like to meet a girl with a tighter pussy than SPY
I literally just said he‚Äôd have to have a massive upset with mail-in votes in NV (which are heavily Biden skewed). If he doesn‚Äôt upset in NV, he has to win all of the last 4 states.

No one else would match him there, and they'd all probably lose the same minorities Biden did (they're voting for Trump for fucks sake).

They called Wisconsin for Joe Biden

Holy fuck... I'm not getting any work done today. 

I can't look away....
I understand your rationalization, but Republicans call Democrats socialists, communists, killers of babies, criminals, and other crap. Why latinos and black voters weren't picked up by that rhetoric? 

Being racist and bigot is not exclusive of one demographic. This is the largest lesson here. We are fucking screwed.

I have 6K to spend what do I get?
Why did they call WI with a .7% and won't call GA with a 1.7% or NC with 1.4%. All the states have 94-95% of votes accounted for
That's what I kept thinking after March, but the media has made people forget about it. I mean it only took six months for it to get back to the ATH after a 26% drop, it's insane.
Biden wins Wisconsin nio calls
Instead of MacBook pros and iced coffees they have AR15s and lifted trucks.

Yeah I know dingus. Everyone was saying buy puts if you think Biden was going to win.
People in here will throw 10k on otm fds but not throw 10k on -300 odds for biden when he's literally a guaranteed lock to win.

That's a free 3k to you fuckers who want it
I wouldn't. It tanked on previous earnings, even during the buying frenzy of the summer. Market could also go down tomorrow for a retrace.
God willing.
Definitely not true. Wisconsin just went for Biden. So has Arizona. All Biden needs to do is hang on to Michigan and Nevada, and he's looking really strong there
Why would it be? Big ass stimulus, international trade opens up, removes threats of massive civil unrest, and eases the covid depression with green new deal. Stonks are fine either way imo

So why didn't they vote for Ted Cruz, Kasich or Carson, who are far more religious and actually have strong conviction in their faith? Anyone of the religious nuts in the primaries would have given the church the same political power and yet they went for Trump, the least religious of the lot. What does that tell us? 
Hint: it was never about religion

Imagine having one of the greenest days ever and not making money today
why do you say that?
Seriously.  If he actually provided the strength he pretends he does he would have had this in a landslide.
The democrats are the solution so that less riots happen and people can go back to their lives. Trying to support an ineffective leader will bring more unrest not less. Back to Cuba, wouldn't it have been better to have a centrist left wing government replace Batista instead of the communists who filled that void?
Show the logo on ur wheel puss
Anyone playing Zynga??? it's about to moooooooon

I have a feeling if every discussion forum and every media platform is giving opposing views on why either candidate is good or bad for stocks, even the institutions are probably divided on the subject. An argument could be made for either.
It worked out and that‚Äôs great but you realize that was super irresponsible though right?
Trump campaign still thinks they can win AZ
They‚Äôre probably thinking this is the last thing they can do. Stop counting so the lead doesn‚Äôt widen and demand a recount
We aren‚Äôt going to be leaving 346 are we?

Na all Biden needs is Nevada now and he has like a 90% chance of winning Nevada although they‚Äôre only at ~70% votes counted. He basically already won.
Well good news for people is that it is going to the court. Mail in voting makes it a lot easier to commit fraud.

It's fine, bro. Sounds like you need some to alter your perspective
I guess a follow-up to my other question, do you guys think this race is over and our president is Biden?
America did not go loco ü§£
Great now I have to milk a donkey?
Do you want him to make money?
I'm all JACKED UP ON MOUNTAIN DEW but I'm down 90%.. time to make it back!
Oh okay.
Wait can some1 explain to a retard why the markets fucking popped today? Isn‚Äôt a Biden pres bad for stonks?
I literally have to google twice to know that PA doesn‚Äôt have more votes, bother counted and uncounted than registered voters. 

Why can‚Äôt you do the same?
I can't even imagine how tense it must be in there right now.
They say money doesn‚Äôt buy happiness but looking at Nasdaq 4% puts a smile on my face
Should be ok, if Biden wins this will skyrocket and with all the rampant voter fraud he's looking like he's gonna take it. If trump wins, unload some tomorrow when it goes back up. I personally think this is the NIO dip and Thursday is green Friday probably flat. But I am retarded so what do I know?
Something tells me Oregon isn‚Äôt going to refer their crackheads to specialists. Could be wrong tho. I guess Oregon is going to be a science experiment for a while

Why? Apparently it works for the GOP to call half of Americans ANTIFA terrorists.
She bought baba at the high. Dumbass
The election isn't over until January 20th
name a better battleground state than spy 346


pro tip: u can‚Äôt
Elections like this show how efficient the stock market is at incorporating information into the price... It doesn't necessarily mean it interpret information to the "true price", but it does a damn good job of reacting.

Hi, my name is John from Kentucky

I believe wearing a mask should be a choice and that the government shouldn't interfere with my health. My body, my rights. I also do not want socialism to take over America.

I also believe that I should have final say in what woman do with their uterus. Their body, my choice. Now if you'll excuse me I need to see my Medicare provided doctor after checking to see if my SSI deposit hit.

GOP is the party of contradictions.
There are a million autists on this sub. Everything is gonna get mentioned. Others just less frequently than others.
WI and AZ are both now called, it‚Äôs pretty much over for Donnie unless Biden gets upset by mail-ins in NV. Trump would have to win all 4 MI, PA, NC, and GA.

Well Democrats can get all the retards.out to vote and get them to vote for Biden, but getting them to vote for House and senate much harder. Low IQ welfare tards can only remember one name at a time.

Hispanics become conservative once they get papers. I live in 90% town in socal that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been. Plus also add the fact that the gop kept saying that dems where socialist, so that cause Cubans and Venezuelans to vote for the reps

Well hispanic is because of Cuba, at least in FL

I know that its impossible to really ever explain whats going on with stonks, but WTF.  It makes no sense to me that the market is up 8% this week.  Going heavy on some 11/6 340's as I think the market crashes back down.

Makes little sense. Considering buying ICLN and MJ calls.

According to you and your outlook.

Not according to people watching democratic cities riot, burn down businesses, and argue for socialist style welfare. Those things happened, too. Just as much as Trump shat on immigration, shit the bed with China, and mishandled the pandemic.

You have to be able to pull yourself out of your frame of reference right here right now. This is extraordinarily complex and a huge part of the problem is the far left and far right being incapable of recognizing that there are some good points on both sides.

could it be senate being won by republicans?
Down 45% today. Dead by weekend.
Republicans remain in control of the senate which is huge for drug companies because they believe in for-profit pharmaceutical companies whereas Dems do not.
Meagan Wolfe from WI have an onlyfans?
Just so everyone‚Äôs aware. RKT made continuous 6% leaps daily leading up to its last earnings. It then dumped 30 minutes leading up to close before the ER. Buy RKT calls. Sell EOW. Free money. (Also buy shares cuz they really are a great company)
It's up 5% today and analysts increased their target by ~60% from Q2.

I want to believe it'll do well, but I don't think a straight call is the play on this.

Reddit Trumpers told me they hate Collins as much as Dems do. I don't get it tbh.

I voted Biden, but I also really think the democratic messaging is off target. Trump picked up more black and hispanic voters for a reason. The polls were off for a reason.

It isn't working to just call half of Americans racist and sexist bigots. Instead of considering the legitimate reasons people have for holding various positions, the tactic seems to be shaming them into silence.
Also, votes are legitimate even if they take longer to count
[deleted]
Least likely yes but for not a single person to vote for him out of that many people is a little crazy don‚Äôt you think?

SPCE is tanking...
Cheers mate, are you holding any other Chinese stocks? I have a feeling that China's economy is in for a hell of a decade.
Why do you think healthcare would tank if Biden wins? You‚Äôre insane. He‚Äôs not gonna abolish private insurance and the senate is still controlled by republicans.
It's probably a fake pic then because most states stopped counting at 10PM

Trump wouldn't stick to the rules though
Can you ask for a recount on your robinhood account?

Basically how trump is feeling right now.
Oops
Give me one good reason not to buy RKT calls rn
waiting
Stop lmao
Im just gonna hold and cross my dick around my wife‚Äôs bf‚Äôs dick and hope blue wins or something
It's never gone back to back to back.  It usually goes up than goes down half.

So who knows I ships off sold these calls at the top now just watching money burn
Good question. every earnings turns out shit even when its good results. 

But will it get fucked again or not that is the question.
Vegas and potential lockdowns - could be interesting.
Holy shit... Biden won. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he loses PA & GA..... Biden won Wisconsin & Michigan... he‚Äôs at 270 already.... Biden is the new fucking president of the United States üá∫üá∏
Positions PINS NIO ATVI
JMIA December $11 and $12 puts guarantee you at least a 50% gain (earnings crash on November 10) so maybe buy them on November 8 or 9
No
I mean he literally told his base to vote in person not in mail ...
Yeah lol same one.  Sold when I saw it dump to $1.70 and then raged when it mooned to $2.75 an hour later
These NIO day trade puts are fucking beautiful. Sold my calls on the run up, playing the downward movement now.

Will load up more calls EOD or EOW.
Just bought a google put to save all the call holders out there. 

You‚Äôre all welcome.
EV is really dying! 

Is there news? Or is this a reaction from the election?

dayumnnnnnn
Can you truly YOLO if it ain't expiring soon?

When the Chinese takeover. Oh..wait...ü§î
Here's the deal

Biden is a wrap in MI and WI. He needs just 1 more state to win the entire election (not AK)  
Trump on the contrary, needs to sweep PA, GA, NC, NV and AK to win

This is why betting sites are giving +350 to mango. The probabilities for a Mango win simply ain't there anymore. *Especially* now that we know the majority of late-counts will be mail-in dem votes...
Buy the dip.
No I don‚Äôt think so I doubled up

Why is BABA bleeding out before ER?
I‚Äôll send you a pic but over night 138000 votes came in for Biden and legit 0 not a single one for trump
Did we have the same contracts lol. I did the same shit. Bought this morning at $1.14 each, sold earlier at $1.64 each, and then watched them go to $2.75 half an hour later
Sell those cuz
I love it when an option that have been holding at 0.01 suddenly goes up to like 0.23. It‚Äôs like finding a $20 bill in an old jacket

Isn't that what's inching Texas towards turning blue? I'm not from either state so IDK really.

ahhhahaha so fucking true. good one
So over 138,000 people and not a single one for trump.
I've been in NIO since it first started moonin on Thursday. Its made me a lot of money this last week but constant 8-17% for 4 straight days is not sustainable. Saw strong resistance at 39.50 even though volume was through the roof so I sold.
NIO going straight down lmao.

imagine voting for a man that has dementia and a vice president that is an actual socialist
Lol all in CRSR 35 call
Imagine being a dumb ass zoomer and voting for Biden who basically killed small business by pushing for shutdowns and  unnecessary race tensions.  I thought young people were suppose to be against big business and government.  They are basically ccp and Amazon bootlickers.

Trump filing a suit and the market keeps pumping
Trump literally told his followers not to mail in votes. That‚Äôs why mail in votes are predominantly blue. Mail in votes come in later.
If anything, a lot more people are legally gonna get high on mushrooms and weed after this election
WHOAAAA, apparently I set buy orders for NIO when I was drunk and they‚Äôre filling.
Someone tell me what‚Äôs going on
Jesus NIO took a dump.  Was upset I sold my options for $1.70 instead of $2.70 but they‚Äôre almost worthless now
Time to buy puts?  Trump train is gonna contest this to the end.  WI votes are extremely close, and PA could be the same as well.
The incumbent victory rate is way too fucking high for how shitty everyone acted the last 10 months.
NIO got WSB kiss of death üíã
how come we can do emails, banking, and taxes on our phones but literally cant do voting using a computer???

NIO actually going to throw a 12% lead. Impressive.
He was up in Michigan and Wisconsin, and now is losing.

Also looking bad in GA and PA now. 

I did not expect this. 

Man... That's hurtful.
So why did you vote for him, you retard
Why the fuck would you not sell at $5k?
buying those NIO puts at 10 points is looking like a genius move.  Doesn't even matter how much it drops now for me.  Just hope I can time this shit good on the swing trades tmr.
NIO is still gonna climb in med-long term. But watch as it gets the TAN/PRPL treatment from WSB lol
[deleted]
Cause democrats used mail in ballots? Or they counted the red counties first? It gets counted county by county not all at once. Trump lost when he botched the pandemic response. Boomers are the most important vote and he's letting them all die.

EDIT nope
All focus turns to nevada.

With the largest % of ballots left to go in clark county (Las Vegas) and biden already leading this is a guaranteed lock

Pennsylvania is irrelevant anymore

Biden is going to be president for the 165th time i've said today
PS5 launch
No way you can flips head 4 times in a row.   Statistically impossible.
20% remaining uncounted for PA. 1.4 million ballots. Compared to 1% remaining for WI.

You literally can‚Äôt think logically.

Trump‚Äôs losing PA too btw. New batch of 4700 ballots came out from Pittsburgh. 80% for Biden.

If that trend holds from PA mail in, Trump loses PA.
My NIO 35P for tomorrow are printing but I don't have any more day trades... guess I'm holding to tomorrow. Plz die NIO tyvm
Shares are a great play here for the long term as well. Most of my position is in February 20c. I have a handful of November 25c for earnings. Great long term growth potential here in my opinion.
No offense but ty thenü§ë
Yeah it really is. Only thing we can do is pray all votes are safe and are counted.
You don‚Äôt wanna know
Which fucking Stalin are we talking about ? The Russian ?
minorities are still overwhelmingly voting dem though

all this talk about "latino" voters cracks me up. the amount of trump supporters in this group was already abysmal, so even a tiny uptick will look like a massive increase percentage wise
But how did Biden randomly get 130k votes and trump get not a single one

Because we've lived by "When they go low, we go high" which is like bringing a knife to a gun fight.
The average American is obviously more easily swayed by a story that resonates with their own bias while only acknowledging data that supports their views. Do not mistake the Dems not feeding you lies as the same as them being dumb.

Must we split Texas in half though?
it's not because its a split gov it's because no one in the market believes biden will radically reform anything
Not everyone sees it that way. To a lot of these Cuban's it's an ineffective leader who's kind of an idiot vs potentially the kind of socialists that ruined their lives, killed family members, and locked them into generational poverty. You very well may see Trump as the devil and the end of democracy, but these Cuban's see the shape the D's are taking as the same thing. Especially after all the riots - I'm willing to bet that's what got them out and voting. You might think getting rid of Trump will end the riots and you may be right, but they see that as a bully saying follow us or else - something they got used to in Cuba and aren't anxious to repeat and I'd say they have a point as well.

Vote for us -or else- is inherently a fascist way of acting.
They‚Äôre just scaring you out of your longs before it goes back up
True. Not like him, but it‚Äôs still a large chunk of my net worth
LOL a guy at my work was JUST ranting about the sharpies. Jesus fuck these people...
But it has no affect on their willingness to invest. They would rather keep 63% of their gains than not having any gains at all. Would they rather keep 80%? Sure, in that sense they care. But the change wouldn‚Äôt cause a sell off because the alternative is just not being invested at all and earning no return. The only potential shift would be to move to tax-free, but muni-bond rates are so low no one is pulling equity to move it into municipal bonds (that have a higher default risk with a Republican Senate).

So I bought 20 weekly $300 calls for Baba when it was $286 yesterday. Will it print after tomorrow? Only up ~15% for some reason
Anyone holding BABA for tomorrow? What are you feeling? It took a dip today while US tech is still running. Wondering what‚Äôs up
Yes daddy.
One of those weeks where I can do no wrong. Up 110% on NIO weekly put lottos at the top to add to 110% total portfolio gains on the week. Gotta cherish these weeks when the market just speaks to you. Cheers ya'll üçª
üëÄ hopefully a pullback betting on some puts
holy shit NIO was a pump and dump all along
Dude, he can't even spell "polls" right.
It will be very similar.  They're not going to be wrong by like 10,000 votes.  Even if they had to throw out entire polling stations.
Sold my spy calls at 7:30 expecting a dip and now i can‚Äôt buy back in üòé
Senate held by Republicans, doesent matter who wins. Market was way more interested in the senate than president. Divided senate means gridlock, which means no new taxes, no regulations, just 4 years of profit.

Biden and Republican Senate is best case scenario for tech. Gridlock and end to future china trade war.

This is just all around great news for tech.
Who bought NIO at the top?
find a different country
Im talking compared to normal. Republicans almost never have minority majority, but compared to 2016 and previous years Trump broke into Democrat strongholds by quite a bit. It was fragile white dudes who pussied out because they posted a black square on instagram or smth
If we go down we go down together
You must have at least 100%+ NIO gain to be considered a NIO investor.

Trump is going to freak when PA goes to Biden.

New batch of 4700 ballots came out from Pittsburgh. 80% for Biden.

If that trend holds from 1.4 Million PA mail in, Trump loses PA.
Nevada is enough. If Nevada is the suprise, MAGA still have a chance...

What are the odds that once its officially called for Biden, that Trump tells JPOW to cancel every measure put in place to prop up the market since March?
Well, I consider it a pretty deep discount on calls today, especially if Biden wins. Shares might be a longer game. I think you could could play $ICLN, $LIT, $BLOK, $BOTZ, $SOCL & $NERD all year and beat most portfolios. Some are afraid of low volume, but meh

No more outstanding vote in Wisconsin, that one's over with.

You can't count ahead that much? You can start at midnight on election day. 

Orv do you mean before election day cause that's illegal.
NIO elevator down
Yes it is. Most of the votes left to count are from the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Hes not beating Biden in any of those places, especially Tucson
Doesn‚Äôt Nancy break the tie anyway?
ya 322 was the bottom
I saw lots of chatter, but the only real data I found was a screenshot copied from stocktwits, posted on yahoo.  Ridiculous how hard it is to find truth data.
God damn, is there a filter to remove the Nio comments? Fucking hell.
General move I've been making is holding until after earnings if something doesn't moon, if it rallies in preparation for earnings ride the hype train and sell an hour or 2 before.

Got fucked too many times holding through earnings, you can check my post history for examples AMD is the main one on my mind though for the announcement of the new CPU last month. Fucked me good and long.
Actually flipped NIO just at the right time. Rare win for my autistic brain.

This is not at all what I expected: The only demographic group Trump lost support from was white men. He lost a lot. He gained support in white women and people of other ethnicities.

I generally concur with you.
If Mango sues....does that mean we wont get Stimmy until January?
You are so stupid.

He called the left communist and through propaganda and the Dems just dropping the ball tricked an entire demographic into thinking this billionaire separating kids from their parents is for them.
Decriminalized\*
AZ is pretty over
It's because she is a lycan AND a vampire, it's never been done before
Mango is done
They are literally always crying wtf?? They‚Äôre led by the biggest cry baby of all time.
sometimes mango tells his boys to load up on puts
Walks too fast
I never called you racist.

Who says I'm white?

You just lost all credibility with that last statement. Also, I'm not a republican.
Dang. Some ticker VXX is down over 8%. Good time to buy?
Fuck no. I want to watch it moon like Tesla and stay poor. I hate myself.
Damn did NIO finally hit its top?

Or do we go again tomorrow boys!
Yes sir that was the point
What is happening in Nevada?
Nio price target for earnings??
Back to wendies
No matter what, a recount won‚Äôt change WI.
Not over, he wins PA and either NV or AZ and hes got it
neither of those are obvious tbh

thats why betting sites are pricing mango at +350

There is more to it than that (although that is a factor); tons of non faang tech companies under no threat of government regulation are soaring too.

Uh, like 85% minorities went for Biden
hah made me look. ER next week tho.
No
Nio currently writing this is at 37.18, so up 338.18% on my shares
Just check a MACD on several time frames dude.

Georgia and Wisconsin are the really interesting ones to watch.

Edit: WI called now. Thanks
I think that bounty story is bogus.

Ok, so he's some how evil for not wanting the US and Russia to be constantly at each others throats? 

I'm expecting Joe to win which will lead to the Russia tension heating up again, I'm tired of the constant war tbh, the last 3 years has been relatively peaceful and a breath of fresh air.

Yeah, but it's harder one than for example Nevada, I think...
No wonder republican led states are dead last in education
Of course they will. It‚Äôs meme. But if we all ride for a bit and enjoy the gains then what‚Äôs the harm?
Back to 346 :)
Does the president even know how the election works?  None of the vote tallying is ever final the same day, some states have like a month to certify the results.  It doesn't matter what the news reports, nobody has complete totals so it doesn't matter if some states "stop counting."
did wall street just run up prices to trap noobs until January.

welp
I think it'll be contested. It's close enough for trump to try to stay on the throne
It's as if Biden is just another centrist corporate shill and board rooms everywhere are breathing a sigh of relief that they wont have to worry about an idiotic tweet fucking with their stock price anymore.
Can we just get a bigly drop that‚Äôs all I ask
Down goes NIO
Fuck ye brother
Fess up, which of you bought that NiO dip?

Yea, I'm not talking about them. Though it's still ridiculous that they aren't done. They should have started counting them when  right away.
Lol conservatives cry at being asked to wear a mask and over a man kneeling, they're gigantic pussies. They also support a manchild who throws temper tantrums on Twitter every 20 minutes.
Trump went to bed with a green portfolio and woke up to down 90% lol....
DONDA QUE PASA
Fuck yeah
sounds badass to me
Yeah sure. That‚Äôs what all you cultists say everything dumb that comes out of your or trumps mouth is just a joke.
Agreed - but this time around I don't care what they have to say - I just want them to hear me
we probaly dumping at the end of the year
A -4% move in two hours would have a lot of people reaching for the gun. What‚Äôs your point.
_facepalm_

Way to interpret this like a fast-food transaction. Give me a break.

> ie: valuation of $25B then becomes $35B but the tether was based on 10/8.

This isn't a Wendy's where you're buying a hamburger for the price on the menu. There's a **stiff** premium to be paid for acquiring a company that wasn't looking to be acquired. Many of those executives will lose their jobs, they need a golden parachute. Shareholders need to be compensated for their loss of control. It's **really** **fucking** **expensive**.

> analysts upgraded amd to $120... but then (after the deal) downgraded xlnx to $130. (ie: not ~200)

Analysts are a bunch of dum-dums. I don't care about their "upgrades" and "downgrades" Go look at Enron's "grade". Look at Tesla's "grade". It's all bullshit.

 > the math does not add up. this is off by such an absurd margin. far beyond arbitrage.

Yeah, because this wasn't a hamburger at Wendy's and shouldn't be analyzed as if it were.

> you also omit amd going from 88 to 74 on the rumour/news, despite their best er in history and 2 other major catalysts.

Acquiring a company isn't a short term cash grab, it's a long term synergistic value proposition. If you were in AMD for short term gains it made sense to exit. If you were in AMD long term, it's a reason to hold or increase your position. That played out exactly how I expected it would.

There's a realistic scenario (Trump wins PA and GA, but Biden wins all the other close ones left) where Biden wins 270-268 which woulda been a 269-269 tie in 2016. However Nebraska changed their votes to have it be split this year.

You're welcome. Yes, I made a vol and price prediction and was lucky enough to be doubly correct one time and correct enough about one the second. Yes, spread/widen. Convexity is a more complicated consideration than that...

It is true that gamma is greater around stikes near ATM strikes nearer expiry, and it is also true that gamma will not change greatly among strikes at far out expiries. However,  it tapers off quickly in OTM strikes near expiry.

Look at Nov 4 SPY 360C (gamma .002) vs Nov 9 SPY 360 (gamma .015). Further out, but higher gamma. It is not linear, varies widely as all other parameters change, and is only a rough approximation that is not valid if other factors change greatly.

My choice was to go far out in time enough to not incur additional delta change risks by rapidly changing gamma. In fact, that had more to do with my choice than giving myself time to be right, hence "more spread out gamma."

Think of having a fixed amount of gamma. You can either spread it to all strikes very thinly, concentrate it strongly around a strike, or some mixture between those extremes. There are a long lists of risks n\_1, n\_2, ....n\_k. You can push some down, but others will be amplified.

global max option price = highest price over the life of an option. I am saying it is statistically hard to buy in at the absolute top if you are careful.

sad that i was too much of a pussy to take it. but legit thought ü•≠ was gonna sweep at that point
Not all votes in PA are counted. WI is 100% counted.
Remember the rally in Omaha where his supporters got stranded in the cold? It may all come down to that
I'm not quite sure what just happened here?

You‚Äôre a delusional fuck. Only a dishonest POS would want to stop counting votes in a close election.

We‚Äôve known for months that it would take longer this election due to a lot of absentee ballots being cast. We also know trump discouraged his cult followers from absentee voting. Therefore they‚Äôll bias to Biden. 

This is no shit show except for ignorant and dishonest assholes like you.
Thank the lord I moved my money from TSLA to NIO, I got fucking sick of that boomer stock. Getting outperformed by SPY in the past month.
Hey retard.

WI finished counting their votes.

PA still has 1M outstanding votes left to count.

It doesn't, there most likely isn't going to be stimulus. The banks have plenty of money to keep this ride going.

Winter Covid should be either be in full swing or not at all and if it's not overloading the hospitals then fuck all is going to happen.

So republicans remain in control so even if Biden wins, he can‚Äôt raise capital gains tax-that‚Äôs why markets are rallying no matter what
EVERYONE needs to jump on NIO! It‚Äôs priced right. It‚Äôs volatile. It‚Äôs meme. Cmon take your kool aid.
Options pricing in like a limit down or up is possible anytime but the market trades flat
Spy??
priced as green/solar stock instead of a tech stock MFW
Trust me on leidos, good guidance, major rebound, hammered too much by corona, defense is sacrosanct, add tech to it. P/e low.
Imagine caring this hard
I liquidated my 401k yesterday to save america. it worked.
Republican vote in California should matter...
Keep holding man. Keep Buying dips. I have been following NIO for a long time now, this is the only year they are outperforming sales every single month. Their upcoming earnings looking solid but who knows with the way Amazon and Paypal went down even after stellar earnings. But long run, NIO will be a great asset to have in your portfolio. 

Goodluck!!
lol whats their basis tho seriously

I've got a feeling it's going to be a stronger ER than most expect, solely because of the insane influx of new millennial dropshippers during the pandemic. Dropshipping (the numbers from PPE alone are ridiculous) and entrepreneurship have exploded over the past quarter as the younger generations have had to make their own jobs.
i'd take a breather.  this was a gigantic move. election risks still aren't over.  still hold some cash to get ready to fire away.  i'm trying not to get too greedy.
I feel like Bernie got the stamina as long as he can dodge and keep moving but if trump gets a good hit in he‚Äôs done for

Alright boys, I just hopped into NIO.

Expect it to fall any moment. Thank me later.
always contribute whatever it takes to get your full employer match.  Any more you can contribute, your future self will love it.   Diversify the 401k, but lean a bit aggressive growth.  ark, spy, ETFs for whatever industries you think will boom over the next few years.   Next raise you get, buy something decent for yourself, but put the rest into the 401k until you are adding the max per year.   leave it alone, look at it as fake money, never draw against it.  

Hopefully you end up like many people here who are in their late 30s to mid40s, financially sound and essentially working because they enjoy it and use the money on YOLOs.

Ehhh the odds are off but not that much. AZ isn't actually over and neither is NV. I think its like 85% chance biden wins
I feel like Mark Kelly is probably more intelligent than anybody in here.
I asked Cameron Hanes why he supported trump if he was a hunter that advocates for conservation. He gave me a list of a bunch of bills that trump signed into law. But he didn‚Äôt know what to say when I told him that the only reason why those bills made it to trump‚Äôs desk was because of the dems in congress.
He ended up telling me I was lost. Lmao truly shows how retarded these people are.

Ineffective leaders cause societies to revolt violently. They need to be replaced before they fucked things up more. The communist came to power in Cuba, China and Russia because of Ineffective right wing leadership. Electing Biden is only way to clean up 4 years of mess without turning this into outright revolution.
Of course it was contested.. It was literally two old fucks trying to hit each other with canes but not having the quad strength to get good momentum on a swing. Oldest President of all time vs someone older than him. This country is truly fucked for the next generations because of boomers. I hope all their value stocks crash and their retirement dividends dry up.
These guys are ridiculous, but they are correct. Maybe not 25% but something like 10%. I may be biased because I get matched up to 12%

He is clearly going to win WI, MI, and NV. That's all he needs. And every additional absentee / mail-in ballot they count now is post likely majority democrat.

If you're not an American you need to get on your favorite betting site dealing with this election and hammer your entire networth on biden.

This is over and you're getting gifted incredible value.
REIT's legally have to pay out 90% of their EPS as dividends so very little cash value is retained in the stock. High dividend = low/no share price growth.  If you look when REITs report negative EPS their stock usually drops by the same amount

The amount of power FB wields is crazy. This election has shown the world how powerful FB is. That's why it gapped up today and it'll hit $300 tomorrow.
IIRC recount on a vote margin of less than 1,000 votes has never caused results to flip. So unless the margin is sub 1,000 I would say 0% chance that changes the result.
39P, 13 nov, think will drop to 36
Anything but that
Confirmed did go -90% all time going bear gang
Not too late in my opinion. I just loaded more November 20 calls today. earnings should be awesome. My  PT is $30+ after earnings. Possibly before at this rate. If it hits big (as many are expecting), could see $35+.

19.5k max contribution for you. The employer match doesn‚Äôt count towards your contribution it‚Äôs what you put in with your own paycheck. You would need more than 6% per paycheck to hit the max allowed to contribute per year
It even rhymes!
if trump wins pennsylvania, georgia, and north carolina

he still loses

but by only 5 electoral votes

essentially confirming a constested election
Repositioned some of my calls into 11/13 40c NIO. I think this dump is just bears being bears and also people taking profits. The volume is still there and either today or tomorrow it'll be at 40 again.
I‚Äôm waiting until Friday to get 12/18 42c, think this pulls back more

Yes, basically
TBF, Trump did tweet some shit that nuked the market. I guess what I'm trying to say is that volatility will likely go down. stairs up, stairs down type action to look forward to for the next 4 years.
NIO always has the craziest volume. Anyone else wonder if it‚Äôs heavily manipulated?
Trump is losing his shit rn, headline after headline
you mean poor boys?
I can't believe NIO went from like 1.5 to 30 in less than a year, 20 bagger just with shares, probably a 2000+ bagger with leaps at the right strike and date
PA count not until Friday.. here we go ‚Äústimulus talk‚Äù v2üòê
I think you can start a roth ira account that is separate and contribute like 4k or something a year tax free. Otherwise, if you're getting 6pct in and a 6 percent match at 25 thats great, keep it up. Would check r/investing if this is a serious question though, this sub is just for degenerate gambling.

Through Friday maybe even Monday pullback
Need to buy BABA back :(
If you have another day or two, Trump going nuclear at a loss might be what you need, just getting your hopes up before they get shot on again.

If that doesn‚Äôt work, may your tendies be blessed.
Got in 75 March 2021 $19 calls when it hit $18. Still holding. Gj buying high selling low You fkn autist

Neither candidate is good for renewables. Trump says no, and a republican senate will ruin Biden‚Äôs plans.

lol just saw Republican controlled senate means very small or no stimulus at all now that we didn't have a "blue wave" which actually would've been the most bullish. Can we dump this stupid fake pump now?

Have AAPL 107 calls with 11/13 exp. Skyrocketed today would you sell or wait for it to keep going?
With a market cap of 17.78b, and a back log in revenue of 5b right now Palantir is hardly overvalued.

Evil? Sure.

A menace to society? Absolutely, no question.

But over valued?

Hell no, none of the apes posting here know what data even is, or not importantly, where is data going to be in 10 years and the market value of the data?

When I was a child we were storing megabytes of data in floppy disk. Let‚Äôs go ahead and assume the growth continues until 2040.

what did you buy
Trump definitely aged. You just don't notice it as much because of his retarded hair and makeup.

He talks and moves a lot different compared to when he was campaigning first time around.
So, buy shares? Do you think that future of clean energy in America is fucked?
NIO, omg people, this is the worst trap I've ever seen. This shit will gap down overnight
Peters pulls ahead in Michigan Senate race.  Possibility of 50/50 Senate still alive...barely.
The market is printing because it is optimistic the election will be called soon and not drug out. Biden winning is just as good as trump winning right now because it reduces uncertainty.

Your puts are probably fucked if they have no time to expiry.

What is the best EV play that isn't Tesla, Nio, Hyliion?
weed industry is one in which you can't make much money in for various reasons.  One big one is because it's a really easily grown plant.  supply is always ahead of demand, even in states were it's been legal for years.

Man Utd are hopeless
strike?
Who isn't? We have the worst possible scenario with Mango contesting the election, and the second worst possible outcome with a Biden win and Republican Senate.

The market being up today makes literally 0 sense. I guess the old adage of "the market will do the thing that will embarrass the most people at once" is still true.
The Fed has meetings almost every month, and the meetings are general updates to their strategy. The last few meetings have said nothing is changing with their inflation tactics, so we shouldn't expect any different news to come from tomorrow's meeting.

They'll keep pumping money and make vague statements about how they're fine with inflation ramping up a bit in the near-term.

You shouldn't expect this meeting to be a "sky is falling" event. Not at all.
I don't know what any of that means but thanks anyway.
The crash will come after you buy calls.
Judging by Wetug's visceral oozing hatred, it was probably Cramer. He brings that out in traders.
Look up redemption and creation. Essentially you can take SPY shares to the sponsor and receive the underlying component shares in exchange. Or vice versa. But this can only be done in big lots (50k I believe?). So if the price of SPY gets too out of whack with the underlying components, a large institution could use one of the mechanisms above, which would deliver the institution a risk free profit and help bring SPY price back in line.

It's more complex than that. They got fucked by socialism. They aren't voting for Trump as much as against the leftward swing a lot of the democratic party has taken. They watched Portland and the riots and have some personal experience with left wing revolutions.

Eh, dunno about that.

Last night they were -800 for Trump lmao
if there's a red senate, getting more subsidies to TSLA might be tough, so the company would actually have to be profitable from car sales, which means the stock should honestly be printed out and used as a napkin instead of traded for money.

This comic is a perfect representation of privilege!
If I'm not mistaken, the price of the ETF should not be more than the price of the stocks held individually in the same proportion, because they're the same thing. So why would anyone buy SPY for above the price of holding the stocks? Yeah, individuals might do it because we're dumb, but on the aggregate it shouldn't happen. So all spy does is hold the stocks and the market treats it as a basket of the stocks.
Ima keep buying sir
IV still not working in favor of spy puts. Bought a few 10/6 335p when spy was trading at $346.50 @ 0.92c. Spy took a dip to 345.5 briefly and I was still even on them
then go lok at the sources at the bottom of the wiki. Those are legit. Also maybe do something more with your life so high school isn't the 'Glory Days' as your life passes you by.
Speaking as a member of the far right, or the actual right wing, I think you're proving yourself incorrect within that very statement. Identity is hugely important on many levels, but if nothing else, the fact that everyone seems to obsess over it should show you that it is among the biggest issues we face in practical terms. It may not be important in an ideal world where people have no tribes or differences, but that is not a world of human beings.

As Scott Galloway says,
‚ÄúThere are good companies that are overvalued (Tesla, Snowflake), good businesses whose emissions are bad for society (Facebook, Twitter), and firms that are just a menace (Uber). There are also firms that are all three (Palantir).‚Äù

Is it gonna survive by convincing people it deserves to exist, or are people going to notice that‚Äôs false and take their money with them?

*wouldn't the buying/selling pressure of investors buying the ETF as an asset itself, influence it's price?* 

Yes, it absolutely does. Inflows and outflows to SPY cause the underlying stocks to be bought up, and drives the price with it.

Pop lock and ROCKET
Trump doesn‚Äôt understand why voat number only go up
Weed stocks have generally been pretty weak, with ACB  for example, having been in a constant downtrend for more than a year. So I guess they need even bigger catalyst events. The major players beating earnings maybe?
Got it! Let‚Äôs jump boys!
Honestly, there isn‚Äôt going to be a civil war. If trump wins there will be protests and riots like usual but no war. What territory would secede? Who would leave their homes to go there? The military would fight the secession and massacre any and all militants who left.

I have a question for somebody on the SPY ETF.   


How does it track the performance of it's index so well? I get that ETF's are made up of the same stocks and weighted averages of the index itself but wouldn't the buying/selling pressure of investors buying the ETF as an asset itself, influence it's price? how do they account for that when the purpose is to track S&P or underlying?

I need a -8% day tomorrow to make everything back i lost today, what has my life come to
I appreciate the feelings you gave me NIO, it was a good run bud
If u wanna buy puts yes
EV stocks are absolutely dumping rn, especially Chinese ones. Want to buy in on Li Auto in hopes they run up again for earnings but maybe I‚Äôll wait a lil longer and see if it keeps dumping..
doesnt really matter. once Mango dissappears, the GOP is done. he was the lifeblood of the entire party and they have no politics without him. Who they gonna rally around now? ACB? Jeb Bush? lmfao, anyone could beat that low-energy beta

Ah... The denial stage. Got it. Watch for Georgia counts to come in. It's going to put the final nail on ü•≠
But what if it goes to 201%
New batch of 4700 ballots came out from Pittsburgh. 80% for Biden.

If that trend holds from PA mail in, Trump loses PA.

Just listen to him talk. Dude's deep in the closet.

Same with Matt Gaetz, but he just fucks his ex-gfs little brother. 

Fucking weirdos.
what is happening?
very quick day trades, for me usually just a few minutes.  On NIO trading 300 shares at a time, selling after about a $0.20 move, that's a quick $50 or so if you time it right and it moves in your favor.
They vote for the power he gives religion. Who cares if he believes god can sort that out when he dies but he gives the church political power. that is what they want.

Porn star Sean Harding went public on Twitter, alleging Graham has hired multiple D.C.-based escorts over the years who signed non-disclosure agreements, which have enabled this farce to persist for so long.

WTF just happened to it üòÇ
This makes me happy
And when you‚Äôre called this by arealdumbidiot, you know it‚Äôs true
Market is happy with results. For Biden to get anything done he needed senate as well. With Senate staying Republican controlled, nothing will get done, which means everything stays the same, which is predictable for the stock market.

Also, Biden will take corona more seriously which the market likes.
wohhhh
Buy NIO now?

I love how my limit order for Puts on NIO when it hit 40 missed by 5 cents.
The stock market is fucking defying gravity and it cost me $2000 this morning.

Down much more than that since I started this fucking game in September.
Even Scott Walker said it's unlikely a recount will matter in WI.
My NIO calls where up 250% and now I‚Äôm down 11% ama
as soon as I buy Nio it dumps. FML.

This is literally a year‚Äôs worth of gains packed into 1 day
Once its at 21 I'll think about it
Trying to dig myself out of this $4k hole these stupid fucking puts got me in.  This market is not making it easy...
It has been 64% since last night and they have added votes to both sides last night into today. Was over 10% lead for Trump early morning and has been dwindling with no change in % reporting
It's not like 100k votes turning up in the dead of night when nobody's even supposedly counting is unprecedented in this election.
Of all things to day trade today of
Course I pick
Fucking NIO which pumps 12% then dies
It's gonna be Biden and blue house with a red senate, supreme court won't touch this unless mango comes up with something better than the mail-in story. Not much uncertainty left, imo
We‚Äôre also assuming Biden literally lives to see the next term too. Not that we don‚Äôt have older folks in political positions, but age 77 now to 81 at the start of the next term is getting close to nursing home time.
NIO is still up 4.3%. Calm the fk down

Haha hold up, I‚Äôm coming to meet you!
Cause we're a lagging indicator. Stonks go up in long term but short term every stock will go up and down. This sub is often just forecasting that tomorrow the market will move in the same direction as it did today, but often it's the opposite because corrections will happen if there's too big a move one way or the other.
wsb bullish af

i can tell because i got downvoted just for saying put


this shit gonna die
At this point, maaybe NVDA or FB weekly puts but IDK could really go either way
I completely agree. I don‚Äôt like either candidate/party for this exact reason. They are both beyond seeing things in a logical light
I sell music and sound effects so I know the business. Adobe will most likely be the industry leader in STOCK MEDIA in a couple years. They sell you the software and then sell you content for the software. They are cutting out the middle man. Could make them billions a year

To explain ours,

-370 means you have to bet 370 dollars to possibly win 100 dollars. 
 
+260 means you win 260 dollars if you bet 100 dollars.
Skip the middle man and just burn the cash

Not that I'm drunk af or anything but i love this subreddit lol
NIO always seemed to have a 1-2 day period in the past where it doesn‚Äôt move much, its just preparing for launch to the moon. Maybe then? Idk stocks go up and down and I‚Äôm just some random retard that got lucky as fuck. So take it for what it‚Äôs worth.
Username checks out
Stocks rise on hopes of a president
What the hell is NIO doing. I took a nap and it minimized almost all my profit
It's a total coin toss imo, could go either way.  Would probably take profit if you can and look at buying back in the morning, but I'm a total pussy.

Depends on what is triggering you to buy.
I‚Äôd buy in now at 347
True true but we still have time and it‚Äôs a retard strength stock. But yeah, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm done with weeklies personally.
mine's 5k loss. sold 331c
Grads!
It just seems pointless to me at this point. I‚Äôve seen half my family scream trump is going to be the end of us all and the other half screaming Dems are going take our guns and kill us all for the last 4 years. I‚Äôm watching from the outside and I‚Äôm like y‚Äôall need to chill the fuck out. Neither side has given an inch so saying the same old talking points is useless and a waste of time imo.

I‚Äôve taken multiple IQ tests and other aptitude tests throughout my childhood/teenage years and have never scored below the 90th percentile in any of them(although I‚Äôve never been told my exact IQ score). In fact I‚Äôve rarely scored below the 97th percentile. My parents never shared my actual IQ score with me and claim they forgot the score, as I took the tests at a pretty young age. The only reason they wouldn‚Äôt share it is if I scored very low or very high. And I‚Äôm definitely not on the low end. I used to get in trouble at school all the time and often got lectured by teachers who said they expected much more from me because of my aptitude scores. Personally, I don‚Äôt think IQ scores mean much but since you brought it up and implied that I‚Äôm low IQ simply because my parents are..

What is going on unh?
F me
He should have just presented the facts to the public and not worried about the effect on the market or panic.  It's a once in a lifetime disaster that we all have to face.  His initial travel ban was a great idea, arguably should have gone father and just left those in exposed areas there instead of bringing them back home and letting them loose in their states until we really knew how long they can be infectious for.

As a healthcare worker where the heck are the N95 masks they promised to increase production on?  Still can't get any.

Not all of the blame is squarely on Trump though.  The CDC did initially give some bad advice, why would they have ever thought that masks wouldn't help at all to reduce spread.

But he undermined the lockdowns in a lot of states so we ended up in a weird situation where businesses were hurt but we didn't really prevent the spread much because people still kept going out frequently to the few places that were open.
Won't be as big as democrats wanted with a red senate. I'd expect Reps to switch back to concerns about the deficit and spending to hold the line on taxes.

Eh, during trump's term it was russian collusion non-stop. Not saying Russia didn't interfere but gotta admit it was pretty fucking annoying on Dem's part even after the mueller report. Like...just let it go man.

If you bought a weekly at top 1% flush means you lost 30%.
It moved a lot in the run up. Buy the rumor sell the news maybe?
theres about a 45 year age gap between 2008 Obama and 2020 Biden
NASDAQ up 4%, TSLA in the neggie. Thank fk I stopped playing this retarded ass stock.
Thank god, my nov 20th and nov 27th calls bought at $78 tanked -60%. Made some decent profit and got the fuck out of that
Yep. Holding shares and been selling covered calls waiting for "the big one." At least I closed the position today.

U gay bears just love getting fucked in the ass don't you?

As soon as we break in $36 I‚Äôm buying
It‚Äôs crazy, the rally yesterday at least could be explained by people thinking there was gonna be a clear winner, but that changed after hours and overnight and now we know it‚Äôs going to be heavily contested. So I would have thought there would be a reversal today, but instead we‚Äôre still seeing a face ripping rally.
this is strictly factual
LEAPS are almost as safe as shares but have exponential potential

Peaked at $39.75, now down to $37.25 and possibly still dropping. Still above yesterday's close though. People should've realized today's runup was unsustainable.

I don‚Äôt think President matters. We have red senate so tax increases will be hard to pass even if Biden wins. As for prospect of a lower stimulus that is good for tech too because senate wants a smaller stimulus and more fed QE instead of big stimulus.

Market today: "Looks like Biden will win, great news!!!!"

Dude, do you literally only get your information from the news????

Jesus, voting isn't new. 

No. You have 3-4 weeks to vote. Cut off mark for mailing in is 3-4 days before the election so that your letter has a chance to get there. 

By midnight either all the votes have been counted or is statistically impossible for the other person to win. (Winning by a million but only 500,000 left).

The reason for that cut off time is so you can now exactly how many ballots you have.... Exactly. So every ballot counts.
we won‚Äôt know the winner for over a week and it might go to the courts


market: this is actually insanely bullish because
Upside is huge, downside is meh/bleed out. That‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm considering it.

> Lack of stimulus entirely just seems to mean business as usual.

It just means continued failure of smaller companies and growth of the megacaps.
the only thing that would do it is if the Fed said "look, we made a mistake by propping up stock prices and buying corporate bonds. The US is a capitalist society and we've been preventing the application of freemarket competition by artifically keeping dying companies alive. Our bad. Trimming down the balance sheet and bowing out, GG"

It's my opinion. The only thing that matters for oil is Saudi. Saudi can decide to cut production and increase the price/bbl overnight. 

The current oil downturn is being caused by Saudi - they were sick of US oil producers picking up their market share and having to cut deeper and deeper every time to sustain oil prices; and they turned on their taps to put US oil out of business; whenever they decide they've damaged the US capacity enough is when we'll see oil come back.

Now, with the lack of travel with COVID and the demand going down Oil is getting it from both sides - supply AND demand. 

The oil industry in the US isn't dead - but when all is said and done the players will be different.

I'm doing a lot of simplification of a complex global industry though.
Yeah but one is a foreign looking foreigner.
Yea I don't disagree with that. Solar, EV, and related companies like Tesla are all +++ long term imo. There will be a shift from like the old oil companies to "new energy" happening whether the government speeds it up or not.

Literally was just WAITING to rubber band off that bottom support. IMO it is going back up to $240 because they literally can't go tits up.
No matter which side you‚Äôre saying that to it sounds retarded asf

Bears 100 pts down at the end of the 3rd quarter. They‚Äôre on a 20-0 run though heading into the 4th.

There's been absolutely nothing bullish about the last 2 months.

$SPY tops on the 2nd of Sept after a euphoric rally. Proceeds to eat shit for a whole month, after which "hopes" and "talks" of stimulus cause it to rally euphorically again on the 12th of October because it was "oversold". Again, it proceeds to eat shit (all the while unable to overtake its previous highs) with Mango's corona incident, and yet again more stimulus delays (till after election).

Now again, today, we see a THIRD diamond hard euphoric dildo rally, in the "hopes" of the "elections being nearly over" and "talks about stimulus resuming", with the WSB autists saying "markets are oversold". All the while Europe is shutting down again, US is near 100,000 cases per day, election is still effectively undecided (and will more than likely be contested), and no one has a clue when stimulus is coming.

I swear to god if any you bought the top today, you are dumb, mouth breathing motherfuckers. You really think this is sustainable, logical movement? You must hate money.
Is +5% an entry to buy for NIO? Lmao. It‚Äôs a dip

I met Trump at a bowling alley in 2013. He was the oldest person there and kept saying how he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútoo old‚Äù for pranks. He said ‚Äúthis is my most powerful prank. I‚Äôm going to knock up your wife. I‚Äôm not afraid of the law, and I don‚Äôt get along with strangers."

Love how I bought calls on TSLA this morning when it had dipped to 425ish the 2nd time and then have gotten to watch the rest of tech moon while this shit's dropped 30%.
Not true about the movies. A lot of their popular stuff is Disney related. New Mandalorian, New Obi Wan show, Wandavision, etc. All new entertainment coming to Disney+.

Plus they only just relaunched their online store in June which the market hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpriced in yet.‚Äù The stock was beaten down primarily cuz of store closures which are now opening + the online store.

And then you have to consider Christmas. 

Im not worried about my large position, so this isn‚Äôt me being a shill. I truly feel that Funko will be $10+ after earnings.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jl45xl/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gamv4ux/?context=3

Which I posted last Friday and it's been true this week. 

It does not mean it'll just go back down. It more likely means vol will get crushed (already has). But on average no one actually sells. Any "selling" is mostly due to MM hedging puts which now they can take off and we get to our base case of stocks going up (but obviously much slower than today).  See 2016 post election.

Can't hear you over the sound of you sucking that old pedo's cock.
personally I think identity politics is dumb on both sides and no one focuses on actual issues.
Democrats also never believed that trump won legitimately.  That‚Äôs just how elections will be from now on. People are too emotionally invested to admit their candidate lost.

>"At the vote center, you may notice fine-tip Sharpies are used. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the fastest-drying ink and works best on the tabulation equipment. If you‚Äôre filling out your ballot at home, you can use blue or black ink with ball-point pen or Sharpie. Just don‚Äôt use red ink. The tabulation equipment cannot read red."

Dear NIO,

Please come back to earth, briefly, you rose to fast too quickly! For the health of your long-term business strategies and shareholders, the best strategy would probably be to drop to 35$ for a couple days, before resuming your moon mission pre-earnings.

Thanks. So essentially, you lean delta as a hedge/play against expected change in vol.

One more question, but why do you say "spread out among strikes." Maybe just semantics but I can't interpret. I think of 'spread' as 'to widen,' and as you go out in term the opposite happens. gamma is both less significant and more similar between strikes and convexity much lower. 
I'll save asking what 'global maximum price is until tomorrow. I haven't slept much watching the election...

...and thanks for taking the time to respond. You seem to know what you're doing, but your semantics are a little funky to me.

...and congrats on your AMD, always makes me happy to hear when people do well.

A few otherwise healthy people around me have died from the virus üòûand I‚Äôm not making it up. They would not have died from a regular flu.
There‚Äôs never the guy to say it so I‚Äôll be the one to fuckin do it. Don‚Äôt dance bulls, donate to your local food pantry‚Äôs. And fuck you.
Yup
Yes

Earnings are always 50/50. My suggestion is buying calls for December to avoid the high IV. I think RKT is very solid and definitely will beat earning.
RKT and Funko are the moves this month

You have a repeat of the Obama years where this is a steady hand guiding the ship but a GOP Senate that wont increase taxes on big corps, so thats why tech is running relative to IWM, which needs stimulus that wont happen

I said this. Just play it safe and have two boring white men on the ticket and win in landslide.

It‚Äôs a toss up.

Democrats just really like to lose elections. They just can‚Äôt understand half of America likes guns, is racist, and hate women. 

Just cater to that and win more.

After hearing what Trump said at 2 am my parents genuinely believe democrats are trying to steal the election and that they cheated lol. Before all the votes are even counted. Not sure how I‚Äôm related to these conspiracy theorist buffoons. They literally only watch Fox News and watch it for 1hour minimum per day. Sad seeing them so angry over Trump possibly losing. Like he‚Äôs the greatest president ever in their eyes. My parents have such a low IQ it‚Äôs fucking depressing.

He needs to win NV. That's really the most worrying state for Biden; idk what votes still need to be counted (rural vs mail-in) but rn there's only an 8k margin.
anyone got eyes on the guy going to chop his dick off?
Twitter censorship propping up the market rn

Fuck it. Doubled down into VIX calls (sqqq and uvxy). If I lose, I go out in a blaze of glory. If I was right, I get back to only -30% all time.

Why is Tesla looking like dog shit rn
Yeah but if PA, GA, or NC flip to Biden then the 270 squeaker margin won't matter as much. Republican party still might go after Michigan about that but they won't do it with the same gusto as they will if it's 270.  


A 270 mark would mean they'll challenge WI and MI while the Democrats might challenge GA and PA.
PORN LOSS PORN LOSS PORN LOSS
Still you. Never looked at his tax plan. Didn't think I had to worry about him winning
His wrecklessness with covid has directly impacted my life as a healthcare provider.  I could never vote for him after this year.  I voted for the libertarian candidate though, my state is heavily democratic so my vote didn't really matter for the big 2.

Gonna be funny Biden won this because he pulled one vote from Nebraska. 270 to 268 final
Omg NIO LANDSLIDE NOOOOOO ! OMGOMG
"I'll never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. I promise"
That‚Äôs not how vote counting works.
that could work
Hmm... even with Trump actively attempting to prove he's a bigger retard than this collective sub these past 11 months, the fact that this election is so close + the senate is still likely to go red is NOT a good sign for dems.

Any teens in here? Lookin more likely than not some dipshit like Tom Cotton is going to be president in 4-8 years, sending you to die in Asia. Yolo while you can boys and girls.

Too old for selective service gang, hands up.
Didn't he buy when it was between $2-4?  No matter how u slice it he's still coming out a winner.  I would hold too if I was him, the upside is too good not to.

Yes there's a reason, which is holding leaps while selling weeklies

Learn about diagonal spreads people
I only say it because, and I‚Äôm admitting a lot of ignorance here, managing stimulus and pumping money into an economic system that is in many sectors frozen (industry shut down) seems potentially disastrous... but I‚Äôm sure there are much greater minds on the issues at hand.

if it couldnt even move up on that insane pump, its gonna just die on the incoming dump.
Wait
TSLA wrong way !!! TSLA 440 eod üòÇ
I bought a shitload of puts when SPY was at around 347.5. I never, ever win, though, so you guys should by calls right now.
At first I regretted selling my TSLA calls today. Now not sweating it because I copped ADBE at calls at open.
Yeah i bought a couple calls 260 strike when it was teasing at 248
I think SHOP and PENN are ridicuously overvalued.  PENN is the only gambling stock still way higher than what it has any right being.  Their financials are terrible.  There's a reason it was trading at $20 last year and $4 earlier this year, and a reason that most Vegas gambling stocks have done very little.  But it's a cult of Portnoy tards, and like TSLA/Musk he's kept it high somehow
So you‚Äôre saying there are only 69 ways for this to end? I don‚Äôt believe you.
expect lots of ups and downs guys
QQQ up +5% intraday, perhaps betting on gravity would have been the move
This whole election and counting votes is too complicated and takes too long. Throw them in the octagon for 3 rounds. 15 minutes later we have the results. Eazy peazy.

youre a fucking idiot

How does it feel to be this fucking stupid
Oh my bad. Thank you for clarifying
Dont worry its all about to dip
buy amzn call for jan?
I sold, finna rebuy at a possible dip tomorrow
It'll tie up some of your margin if you do that and if you wanted to sell a massive rip and then wait a little, you'd have to take a delta hit to the rally, but if you aren't using much margin at all and are holding through everything anyway, no reason not to.
Actually it does. Usually people who make comments like this are the ones losing. I only sell covered calls and buy shares. So I make a lot from premiums from idiots like you
Idk bro if ur up I‚Äôd take profits and re enter another time
Buy ORTX hugely undervalued
lol I would‚Äôve sold when I was $730 but I have no day trades left
Why is there no pictures of Biden with Jeffery Epstein, but numerous of Trump with Epstein? I think you have the party of pedo‚Äôs reversed.

Dude don‚Äôt miss out:

> J.P. Morgan Asset Management's 2019 Retirement Guide shows the impact that pulling out of the market has on a portfolio. Looking back over the 20-year period from Jan. 1, 1999, to Dec. 31, 2018, if you missed the top 10 best days in the stock market, your overall return was cut in half. That's a significant difference for only 10 days over two decades!

I just saw the greatest tip on stock twits. If you're tired of losing and keep doing hail marys on the hopes of a win, dont. At market open, wait for the first 5-10 minute sell off then buy in, or buy in right at open. Follow the daily trend, so up or down, doesn't matter. Buy x# of options right outside of the money so 1 strike above or below the price, and let it ride until the last 30 minutes. Then you follow the trend, and exit position before close, or the last 30 minutes. Always have cash on hand and if you keep winning, send money back to your bank to clear your debts. If you have 0 debt congrats buy small cap and don't touch it. You'll sleep better at night knowing you won't get screwed if you're wrong. 

Wow.... this spoke volumes to me. Maybe I'm the one whose wrong and its not the rigged market.
I love NIO but I sold at 39. I see a big pullback tomorrow after such a huge day today.

Let's see, Democrats took COVID seriously and likely would've mailed-in their votes instead of in-person and Trump shat on mail-in voting.

So yes, yes I do. You think if there's fraud that Democrats would just eke out a fucking 20k margin that's within recount? If we're gonna fraud we might as well do it like Republicans do and give ourselves 200k votes.
And then they counted more votes and now he's not winning. Democracy is a bitch and a half ain't she.

If you win an election you shouldn't be subjected to defending whining from the guy who lost.  They did their jobs.  Trump didn't do his.

I am not everything that is wrong with the country. And you cannot solve all your problems with binary voting on individuals anyways. The perfect system is not here.

I married abroad and with Trump it's actually a legit question whether we can move to the US together due to Trump's executive orders. Best case scenario with Trump is ~3 years of paperwork and waiting + $5-$10k. Worst case is we just get denied, and getting denied once could be it. No likely appeal, never able to move back. Pre Trump was a fraction of time and money and near guaranteed success for a case like ours.

Alrighty MMs picked up all their puts on the cheap, now they can dump.
\+10% spike for QCOM earnings? yeah yea?
Only reason Trump was even considering stimulus was because it would make him look good

If he wins we can pretty much kiss stimulus goodbye. Hell, kiss it goodbye if he loses too because I guarantee he'll be so butthurt that he won't do anything positive as a lame duck.
so what do you think is gonna happen?

cuz in 1960s aretards just like you were saying they would never get out of shitty commy state failing agriculture economy, but they saw the light and started playing ball and its just got more and more capitalist since then.

You can sell to recoup your initial investment and buy another call with your profit. Only downside is you‚Äôre be taxed as short-term this year if it‚Äôs in a taxable brokerage.
No I know.

But personally I would like a more solid lead than 270.
Yeah, it‚Äôs because you realize that there‚Äôs others out there as stupid as you, but does that take away from the fact that all your trades sucked and that SPY would‚Äôve returned more of a profit? Hell, even a high yields savings account would have returned more.

Problem with people is they constantly try to control other people. Let your father do whatever the fuck he wants with the money he earned.

If it's sitting cash, big fucking deal he can re-enter. He's afraid that his 150k will be worth 25k next week and he doesn't have the time left(life force) to recover (a decade). And will be forced to either suck cock in a bus station to pay the bills, or live in your shitty basement until death.

If he pulls his 150k out to cash it will be worth 150k next week (not counting inflation etc).

Either way. His money. His choice.

Fuck off.

Yeah because they didn't count the mail-in votes yet you tard. Markets are loving a Biden presidency, just enjoy your tendies.
and if you look really closely, you can see how the blue states have infiltrated neighboring cities to swing nearby cities.  (Reno/Las Vegas is the best example. I'm in Reno and Cali Dems have been moving here in droves over the last year with the intention of swinging our traditionally conservative city blue for the vote.  My GF's parents are hardcore liberals and when we moved here their first response was excitement "Yay! You can help turn Nevada blue")

The majority of the landmass of this country is overwhelmingly conservative. Always have been.  The cities are the only real liberal strongholds and that's primarily because they're more co-dependent as a result of living on top of each other.  The majority of people would still rather keep their money and pay for their own things instead of paying taxes and having the government provide things to them.

been reading about the early years of the US, and this isn't even that bad compared to then. The pres's wife legit supported gangs of people beating the shit out of members of the opposing political party. Like full on public support. Many were permanently maimed or killed.

Still feeling good about this?
I understand. I've been there. I'm down almost $95k from my personal all time high after I started trading options. I was stupid and making bets that were too big for my portfolio and I was chasing losses with increasingly risky trades. At my low I had lost 2/3 of my portfolio. Most of those losses happened in three really bad days from stupid trades. I've made back 20k since my low. I'm being more selective with where I enter my positions and I'm taking less risk when I do. If it's stressful, it means I'm overleveraged. If it's boring, I'm doing it right. Take some time off and let yourself reset. You can do this.

His 469,000 vote lead turns into 889,000 vs Biden‚Äôs 980,000.

Also üò¥ is more predictable and less unhinged compared to ü•≠. Stonk market loves stability which üò¥ offers with business as usual red senate. So calls all the way.

Another trick you can do is if your calls are grossly in the money and you don't want to let go is to sell a call near the current strike if doing so will lock in reasonable profits. This will convert your call into a call debit spread. You will lock in some gains and if it stays up until expiration you'll get a serious amount of profit.

It's definitely a buy right now to ride the wave up towards the earnings ( which will be better than expected). Also the new consoles will soon be out and nice pretty companionship with the big gaming companies will spark the uptrend back to mid October highs. The only reason I'm not fully committed is because there are other hotter buys right now like mid - long term AMD or short term NIO.

Unless its in one of those retirement accounts that you dont have to pay taxes on things unless you actually withdraw the money, think its called a roth ira. Otherwise, dont worry about it.

# Palantir Stock Is a Contrarian Play That‚Äôs Ready to Run Higher

### Winning Contracts

Amid all the controversy it‚Äôs also important to recognize the potential catalysts. If you‚Äôre an investor who hasn‚Äôt yet made up their mind about PLTR stock, here are a few things to consider.

Palantir has recently won two contracts which do bring it closer to profitability. On the first two days of October, the company announced that it had won $127 in contracts. The first contract is valued at $91.2 million over two years. It leverages Palantir‚Äôs Gotham and Foundry platforms for AI and Machine Learning for the Army.¬†

The second contract provides for the use of Palantir‚Äôs Foundry software for the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. It brings $36 million in revenue to Palantir. As important as revenue is, profitability remains paramount as well.

Dude someone apparently had a mil in this spread but no idea if he's up bigly
Usually when people predict EOD dumps, they are wrong. But, right now:

- Trump is contesting results in several states
- A federal judge is demanding answers from the USPS after finding evidence that ballots were held and not delivered on election day
- Recount incoming in MI due to margin being less than 1%
- PA probably won't be called for several day, as it'd a state where mail-in ballots can be counted for up to 7 days after the election. 


I *think* this moon is more-or-less due to the ending of uncertainty, but theres going to be an absolute clusterfuck of litigation and nonsense for like the next month, at least.

Wouldn't be hugely surprised if there is some sort of dump incoming.

Disclaimer: who the fuck knows
NIO is too strong. I bought puts on XPEV instead, though LI might've been the better choice.
It will continue to rise regardless. NIO doesn‚Äôt really move with American politics.
Imagine going back in time and telling the founding fathers about this election.


They would have definitely gone for communism
Imagine this stimulus
That's awesome, glad you're not a retard. Hope you're making bank :)
People acting like PA is not in play when most likely Biden has 70~% of those remaining mail in ballots PA election officials are counting right now. 1.4 million.

His 469,000 vote lead turns into 889,000 vs Biden‚Äôs 980,000.

Biden wins in that scenario.

True that. But hopefully you averaged down yesterday at the bottom due to the Ant debacle. I didn‚Äôt want to buy in at the levels it was at, as it was depending on the Ant IPO and I don‚Äôt see a good track record with stocks inflated due to attachment investment to IPO recently. Also China makes me nervous but at the dip price it‚Äôs a no brainer and earnings should cement that for longer plays

Smh, that's not how it works. They count them before hand. They have earlier cut off dates for mail in. Anything post marked for before X date her counted but normally they can get the results by midnight. Rarely are there with left by midnight that it would sway one way. 

The fact that you replied with that right away though tells me the whole narrative right now is being bitten down on hard. 

This isn't the first year we have encountered this.

Anyone here an economics major?
I know. Hence my "formatting"
No, not really. There are millions of votes that have not yet been counted. Not sure why you believe what you do - it takes days to count all mail in ballots, especially this year when there is a global pandemic and most democrats voted through mail.
One of the biggest things that prevented the democrats from sweeping the election was Kamala Harris. When you have someone as old as joe you pay a lot more attention to who goes next in line.

I remember 4 years ago when Trump won, we got loads of posts on /r/italy from Americans who wanted to emigrate, it was a great fun watching them discover it's not so easy (unless they had an italian ancestor)
Portfolio could be greener but still vibin ü§ô
Lol no.  That scenario ends with sleepy at 270 and mango at like 268.
ALL IN ON NIO HAVE YOU NOT READ ANYTHING HERE TODAY
GLD down no matter  what SPY does
wanted 4 more years of Trump sitcom tbh :(
Ok but if you‚Äôre using robinhood you‚Äôd better have 25k sitting in the account or you‚Äôre gonna get locked for pattern day trading. Lol.
We're at tech resistance and momentum is fading. Gonna close my 11/6 3500/3600c and wait for the dip to re-enter. Good luck to all you autists still in the game.
So institutional investors (ETFs?)  long on shares profiting by loaning without risking being called? What happens if/when they cancel their loan?
That‚Äôs why you get in before the pop lol. Last month it went up $10 in 4 days. It‚Äôs up $5 again this week
They stopped counting ballots until noon tomorrow. So, yes probably.
2000 would like a word...
CRSR just over here quietly gaining.

Hooray for RGB
We will
its rallying extra hard on a biden win

biden = no more crazy ass trump tweets that move markets 1-2%

markets love stability
If you are happy with your account balance just sell.

You can always wait for another dip and after a face ripping green day, I would be shocked if we didn't get a red day before Friday...

You clearly don't know.
It would be nice if we have a pullback tomorrow so I can load up on calls. Then continue mooning Friday.

#WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG????

It's counting pieces of paper, you start with 1, and after that comes 2, and then 3. Do they need to hire some pre-schoolers to teach them how it's done?
GOP working on resurrection tech, hitler incoming.
Uh, I care, lol.

They were clearly and blatantly fucking with the USPS to prevent American votes from being counted, which is treason, basically. I want people to held accountable for that shit.

as a hedge no.  if you don't have calls, probably not.
I think a new ATH isn‚Äôt off the table after earnings and that they‚Äôre nearing profitability either within the upcoming year, if not this quarter. I‚Äôm personally unsure of how the market will react on Palantir‚Äôs services if Biden is voted in, however
Depends on how far from expiration.
only out by 8k. seems like alot of rural votes need to come in
That won‚Äôt get him 15% a day
Please retitle ‚Äúhow to turn 66k into 15k in one easy step‚Äù

Bears r truly fuk.

I am so relieved.
Can't run an election from a NY jail cell. Or a Russian safehouse.
Went cash gang it peaked
Not sure you counting right
Obama is an outlier that should be ignored from now on.  The dems have not been able to reproduce his turn out. Becuase he was a unique historical election figure. That turned out to be a historically bad president.

You won't ever see the black turn out like you did for Obama. 

Florida is a red state.
time to buy back into the VXX scam
Bruh, leaps?
do some research on the people in the supreme court

most of them are pro-constitutionalists who would never throw out votes. 2 of the bush-era judges already explicitly said this won't be a case.
If spy can close below 340 that would be highly appreciated

Lol it‚Äôs gonna be flowing in my pockets.

Who cares. Biden doesnt need those votes anymore. Although, might be important for a close senate race
If at profits don‚Äôt be sad
Yeah. I don‚Äôt know why they still talking about counting votes when it‚Äôs already over
Let my options expire worthless like a man
Trump ate shit and so did you, love to see it
By buying these cars you're basically funding the R&D that will end up making it cheaper
you are just dumb lol
Because votes take a long time to count especially when you have to open up, inspect, and tabulate with machines each of those 1.4 million remaining mail in ballots.

PA wasn‚Äôt able to start doing any of that until 7am yesterday, lol
No way Trump ends up in prison, he has enough money (despite his debt) and lawyers to drag out any litigation until his heart finally gives out

yeah i gon fucked that up haha. my bad dude
Don't worry, we already know 10% is going to the big man.
lol yeah a contested election is the same as shutting down the whole economy for a virus that, at the time, was actually thought to be a problem
I bet this is the outcome McConnell wanted if he stays Senate Leader
This
That's true, but all it takes is a small cult who believes democrats are going to enslave jesus and they will do what they believe in
you don't get it. Mango can literally win PA and assuming all else ends the way it's looking then Biden wins 270 to 268 .Mango is arguing about a non-factor at this point

Also, because he won‚Äôt tweet for his buddies.
Right now Biden looks like he is going to land right at 270. No Way Trump does not throw a tantrum about that.

It‚Äôs not looking likely for him. I mean no one can predict the mail in ballot results but they have always favored the democrats and I don‚Äôt see any reason they‚Äôll be different this year. Biden is ahead in all the states he needs to get 270 and it will likely stay that way. I‚Äôm just looking forward to 4 years of no more late night market tanking tweets and futile trade wars. 2017-2018 was a nightmare time for traders because of Trump.

I looked into it more before buying in yesterday. Seems undervalued and earnings report on the 10th. Should be a nice run up.
I'm getting crushed in AG. Figured buying into non-US silver mines would help diversify election risk. RIP that part of the portfolio
Miles Kwok predicted the CCP would murder Jack Ma and make it look like an accident. Perhaps that prediction is about to come true.
Detroit still has a ton of votes left. Biden most likely MI.
If somebody can tell me why stimulus is suddenly more likely now I promise I won't buy thousands more in SPY puts
That‚Äôs what I thought too. Their Secretary of State (I think) said it was wrong and that they really had 300ish votes left. Trump is already asking for a recount.
Wouldn't a Biden win be theoretically good for Amazon?

Yes when Biden wins for sure it will go to 352

Fucken stupid bears get fucked! rip to my spy puts it was a good run

I‚Äôd be surprised if the US elects an Asian American as the president. Asians are deliberately ignored in this country.

You got it all wrong.  This is the signal Jeb! Has been waiting for.

Bc their anger towards Trump however justified or not is actually a proxy for not having the right life mindsets to get through your preciously limited time on Earth in a happy way.
He‚Äôll just join OAN
You say that but he's made a lot of good calls these past few months. He recognized the market was getting overbought during late August and a few weeks before the election right before those two lethal corrections. He was saying to buy tech during the troughs of the correction. He said to keep away from banks and energy all the way back in July despite how cheap they looked.

The craziness of the market has thrown off a lot of investors, but so far he's been right in this market (until he isn't ofc, but who knows when that will happen)
Thanks for your $500 contribution to market.
Fuck the market
Trump campaign calling for recount in Wisconsin
bahaha, based off the futures movements during his speech last night.... Definitely something in the markets
There‚Äôs literally people on r/conservative writing ‚ÄúThis is how Trump can still win‚Äù comments.
It‚Äôs bound to happen right
Hmm last time I followed a post into a trade I lost 40% of my portfolio.... I‚Äôm in
Put me in charge of it.  I'll run it into the absolute fucking ground in no time flat.  Might even do a little jail time on the side.
You share the website which you used to create your algorythm
WARNING; contested election, Trump and his supporter not accepting the outcome. If this ends bad it could shock the market like corona back in March. I just went cash.
Fuck you right
PA have people with more fingers. Fact
Prediction : up 2% on the day after profit taking and rug pull tomorrow
Its more to do with Biden failing to motivate people than Trump having a bunch of hidden fans.
But my GME is still good right? 

RIGHT???

Yeah , who cares abt earnings btw..
Am I crazy for buying spy puts?

I‚Äôm not going to sit here and pretend I believe my options are going to be better with one or the other. But to think that we‚Äôre just going to regress 100 years and simultaneously become a full socialist country because Biden, who was probably one of the most moderate dems during the primaries, is elected and live in fear is fucking stupid

Seeing all these retard boomers genuinely scares me for my future not because of the economy and shit, but because I‚Äôm afraid when I‚Äôm their age I‚Äôm going to lose my ability to think for myself and use common sense

That 120k out of MI is suspicious, but Trump has to win where he's winning and get that investigated. That could take a while to resolve.  


If Biden flips even one state where Trump is leading currently it's irrelevant.

Poor guy makes $13 or $14/hr along with his wife. I see there may be a generic in 2023 and he gets his insurance back in January. Maybe there's a program like short term government assistance to spot that 2-3 month gap, or if his doc can recommend something that could help partially mitigate his issues for something he can afford.
Nothing at all
Lol thanks. I just gotta hope I don‚Äôt get greedy and retarded
This is good for Republicans long term. Economy is rolling over after stimulus and ppp ended. Senate can now obstruct with gusto, and Democrats will get blamed. Probably sweep into majority in 2022.
If it makes u feel even MORE better idk who that is and I don't care to look it up. Enjoy your Mediterranean diets and long lifespans in idyllic countrysides and historic cities with a language that isn't fucking impossible to learn. U guys got Europe by the balls
Yep. Very much looking like this.

Possibly with PA and GA being for Biden as well.
He would be too old tho. They're probably clamoring at a Ben Shappiro type to be their next guy.

Every time I see "Piper Perry Election Discussion Thread". I know thats probably not good.

Then what did anything matter. The elections were going to pass and stimulus with that at some point. 

So why the hell did we drop.

Biden is essentially a traditional Repub from 1988 minus a few social policies.
Better to be irrelevant than to be a worldwide laughing stock like in the Berlusconi times.
I am taking profit just in case but probably not really

im expecting them to beat expectations, definitely not crush. I think that baba being down in general from $320ish, down to $280, and then up to $300 today, a good earnings will push it back to 320 at least for a day or two. 

At least this is my theory. Anyways Ill just buy a few contracts to play it safe :3
GDX 34p 11/13 TRUST. IM LOSING MONEY RN BUT I BOUGHT WHEN IV WAS HIGH NOW ITS EXTREMELY LOW.
I like your plan. Buy nio now and sell in 40 years

Sell your positions now.

Bought puts, huh?

Good lesson to learn. Never bet against America and big tech.
Yep, was down >10% last week and my paper hands took my 5% profit today. Cash gang.
Why is ppl buying AMZN back at top????

Classic buy high - sell low?
RSI is one of my favorite indicators but I use the two together take NIO for example, RSI has been hovering in ‚Äúoverbought‚Äù territory since July and has only seen minor pullbacks when MACD has had bearish crossovers. RSI is great on its own. MACD is great on its own but when you pair them together you are gonna be correct more than you‚Äôre wrong. Technical analysis is great and the more indicators you can pair together the better. Make sure your trades follow your rules and you‚Äôre golden
i was looking at facebook yesterday, and now im just sitting on my hands trying not to fomo

They weren't going to protest a legitimate election. They were only going to protest if Trump tried to ignore their votes and claim authoritarian rule. Which, shocked Pikachu, he fucking did.

I remember reading this last week but I'm pretty new to the game.  Today I saw the news break, and I said "holy shit this autist called it".

Yea it seems pretty easy to understand

Republicans are fucking cancer
Remindme! 2 days
Lol no one here is gonna listen to you, the market is rational. If everyone is predicting a crash, they will try to sell before the crash, creating the crash early as we saw in late October. Crashes aren‚Äôt predictable by the sheer nature of how they work. If you think you know what‚Äôs going to happen someone has already known that and acted accordingly. The best plays will always be long market plays
What do you prefer? 

Massive stimulus or lower taxes?

Which is better? Hard to choose. 

Also, it seems history has shown democrats are better for the markets.

Having said that, a democratic presidency, republican senate and democratic house means that nothing drastic will get done which plays straight into the hands of the big corps and big tech.

Thats why we are mooning today.
ü™Ç
But Biden wants to bring more competition to private insurance via the US Gov't
future you is a millionaire
Biden + GOP Senate = no new stimulus
Both will die before then.
[deleted]
i think his point is that you drastically cut down on access to voting by pushing in person only. its like being a bank and forcing people to access their money in person every time they want it and not allowing credit cards and debit cards.
Goddammit i slept in
Thank you, NIO its been a ride but I need to take a break we can catch up later have fun NIO
DUH
BABA is ripping. Again, hope you saw me flagging the heck out of it since 6am and got good positions. Earnings are going to beat significantly, and Ant IPO reschedule is coming up, Raymond James has increased their coverage of price to 330
lol I definitely did on Planet Fucking Fitness RIP
Nope I got scared and sold right before it rocketed up to almost $348...and I told myself over and over it‚Äôll go up as soon as I sell but I didn‚Äôt wanna sit there and watch it anymore...sigh. Still took profits though
If it makes you feel better i lost everything betting against the Feds for the last 8 months
I know last night all I saw was ‚Äúvix mooning‚Äù and I got nervous than remembered that everyone here is an idiot and buying vix puts when it hit 40 was obviously a good idea

The fact that so many people in here make blanket statements like ‚Äúthis seems fishy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get how the results changed‚Äù is frustrating to me. I know it‚Äôs a complicated process but if you actually do research and listen to experts instead of pundits it does make sense and there is logic in what‚Äôs happening. Take some time and research things instead of spreading baseless conspiracy bullshit.
Maybe it really is hope for stimulus this time?

Why is TWTR up? Trump being president is like half the reason this is still a thing
Suggesting that we trust historical data? We live in a new decade , new algos. AHHHHH CHEWWWW GAH BYE YA BANNED.
the market also likes big stimuluses, and now we'll get none of that
Might get a small dip now for you scalpers, bearish wedge + bearish divergence
Oh god
lmao, honestly I could see it. Or I can see a huge buy then a selloff after markets close
What? How? Trump killed all expectations. The silent majority 100% exists based on the current election results.
Didn‚Äôt exactly choose to grow up in Florida instead of right next to MIT

Is this what happens when everyone was short going into election week & are forced to cover?
The only sad thing is we'll probably see Trump vs Biden again in 2024 now lol
He is bearish against stocks and coin while bullish on gold and look how he's doing today lol
Yes. All you have to do is show up for class for 4 years & pay the school a shit ton of money & in turn the give you a piece of paper. This does not take much intelligence
Ya, confusing
Big L rest in peace
I lost everything today.
The market has been pricing in a contested election. A quick result -- for any candidate -- is all the market wants.
I lost so much money on intel which means it will go up 10% this week

Trump: "I am the bull king"

JPow: "No, I am the bull king."

Biden: OMAE WA MOU SHINDERU
Thanks bro, bought too early too
Well at least now Democrats won't unleash their BLM/antifa goons now that Biden has won.
Yup. Amazed at his stupidity. If he had just listened to his own advisors and medical experts when they started saying masks were effective and hadn‚Äôt gone after John McCain postmortem he almost certainly would have won. What a fucking idiot.
Apparently, some counties in AZ handed a sharpie to voters.

Ballots are strict about using a black ball point pen, rendering the use of sharpies as a potential disqualification of the vote.

Many tweets from people in AZ were talking about being handed a marker.
If this was literally any other year they would have called Trump at midnight. Democrats probably would have called for a recount but most states have cut off points for a reason... This. Apparently only Florida learned it's lesson in 2000. 

That's why he is making a big deal about stopping counting. 

It's going to be a shit show.
Take profits in the next hour. Power hour could be a shit show
I fucking love America, whenever i feel sad looking at the shitshow that are Italian politics, i can look across the pond to feel better. Also, thank god for Trump, after him nobody jokes about Berlusconi anymore.

Boomers in 1990s:  "Son don't believe everything you see on AOL."

Was going to do this but overslept. Congrats lol
There is a misconception that libertarianism is lesse fair capitalism and there is no regulation but that's an extremist view. It's like calling Democrats socialists and Republicans facists. 

If the FDA didn't dick on medical companies and allowed them to use their test kits and let doctors do their jobs we would have been able to contain the virus better. But instead we were allowed 2/12 test kits while the remaining get shipped off to the rest of the world where there are less regulation. 

The federal government should play an advisory role. A small shop in a town of 60 people shouldn't be penalized by their county for not mandating masks.

AZ was pushing for Biden during that time with results coming out during that pump.

Could easily be because the market knew Biden was more likely going to win with AZ.

No shit, it has nothing to do with who‚Äôs winning. Probably has more to do with the fact that no ones rioting.
No civil war
Prove it
Rkt is creepin back up and will moon soon
Thought that today lol
Thetas gonna yoink that single dollar like mr. krabs
Well they voted regardless, just did it all in person

Anybody doing calendar spreads on RKT? What are your positions and reasoning?
Bought for $.03 and I‚Äôll sell at 30.00
We already tanked last week, everyone would know we live in a simulation if it did the same thing on this week‚Äôs episode.
Bigly. So happy to not have to listen to these retards
The stock is a gamble. Ride or die
God I hope my bear homies didn‚Äôt load up on puts to play the election. Ain‚Äôt shit gonna happen, the IV crush is gonna wipe your 10% gains (if you do gain), and the market is gonna have a face ripping rally after all the election uncertainty is over. All the blue balled cash portfolios are gonna nut all over your stonks after their gold hedges start dropping. 

Be a smart bear and wait til December when the election euphoria is over. Hibernate for a month yo.

-I tried to warn my bros. RIP bears
Yoloing on SPY puts last week was not emotional. I did get hella emotional this week.
48 hours ago it was at 325 lol
Well, the senate might stay ~~republican~~ foreign-owned, but at least you have four years of them stonewalling any actual senatorial work to look forward to!

My theory for this rally is that the most likely election outcome from this point is a Biden presidency and a Republican senate. Political gridlock maintains the status quo and the market likes the status quo.

What I said honey üíñüíÖüíÖ
I don't get this.

Futures were up 4% before we knew senate was staying red. And when there were periods of both Biden and Trump leading. 

So this pump has nothing to do with the thought of a certain side winning. 

This shit is crazy. What the hell is it pumping off of.
He hasn‚Äôt officially won yet. And you better believe trump will be a sore loser about it if he does. Personally I don‚Äôt really gaf who wins but I‚Äôm just trying to trade accordingly.
I hope the investigation into donnie comes just as fast as his attempt to raise money already to fund his voting legal battle when he loses
Lol trust me i thought about hedging with some puts. Did not see a 5% day coming at all
Really glad I didn't have time to hedge my bets yesterday, whew

It's pretty simple.

The in-person votes are done on a computer and are automatically tallied. They can be released instantly, basically.

Paper ballots have to be manually scanned and verified.
I am so surprised by how much internet people are surprised, people forget that, < 5% of the population is on reddit & twitter, and more importantly, Trump is an incumbent and running against 78 old Biden, he should have had a historic win if he was a bit competent on covid.

Stop sleeping on CRSR and FOMO in so my calls can print even more
Nah, I dont buy this excuse. They know exactly what they're doing. It's just not socially palatable to admit (loudly) that you're voting mostly for racial and cultural issues. So instead people lie and say it's economics or religion because those reasons are more acceptable. For example, if it was truly about religion, Evengelical Christians won't have overwhelmingly voted for the first openly and obvious atheist candidate in the Republican primaries in 2016.

Seriously. Without a way to shut down mail voting altogether this could do nothing but backfire. This is a scenario where he needed to fight fire with fire
Futures were 4% up before we knew senate was red. And when it thought Trump was leading. 

None of this movement makes sense
MI and WI are looking promising. If they and NV are called in for Joe, then game.set.and.match :)

Seriously?
Anyone know if any Trump family members have tried to board any international flights yet?
We'll know the winner for sure by the end of the week.  Unless you have SPY calls expiring today, any calls ending Friday should print.

And again, the market will respond favorably to either candidate winning.  The market will respond negatively if there's any doubt as to who won.
I dont think this is wallstreetbets is the best place for advise, just set your trailing stop order

Hit 31.34 which would a great spot for me to exit my calls. If that happens again its fine, this is a short term play for me

The best memory I'll have of this election was when some stoopid lady decided to talk about how Trump said vote twice, while she was in the voting center. I'm 99% sure she was a hard blue and was trying to make an orange man bad joke but two poll assistants rushed over to her, shut her up, and hustled her ass out of there all angry like.

It was like the political version of me saying "you da bomb brah" at the airport and being immediately gang tackled by TSA.
Apparently the outcome the Market was hoping for is, no clear winner. Obviously
The key thing is - the election is over.  That means stimulus will flow, because it is no longer a tool to manipulate voters, it is now just... stimulus.
Yep Donald trump defeated it‚Äôs the end of return of the Jedi with dancing Ewoks... Can we please get a reality check

The market doesn't give a flying fuck about who wins the elections or even whether there is a winner. The market doesn't give two monkey craps about whether stimmy passes. The market couldn't care less about the state of the economy or the virus. It certainly doesn't care about earnings or unemployment rates.

It just fucking wants to pump every single day no matter what.
Personal resistance 15k broken 17k achieved üí™ next stop is 30
I guess I don‚Äôt get what you mean by ‚Äúinvestigating the votes‚Äù they can pay for a recount out of pocket in some of these states, trump can appeal to the Supreme Court on certain grounds but he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of precedent imo. We will see though.
I want this election to be done and results being final with no conflict so that I can finally know if I‚Äôll be staying quiet because my guy lost, or if I‚Äôll be rubbing the results in the face of a few certain people in my life. 

And also so my stocks will stay up.

>...but I have to ask, what's your thinking behind looking at Vega vs Delta?

I consider all the greeks and mentally approximate higher order ones representing convexity risks, etc. For instance, if IV or time changes many common greeks you may know will change at different rates and accelerate their changes, and so on.

Simple Example: if IV approaches 0, all ITM options approach delta 1, OTM approach delta 0 and gamma becomes 0 (except ATM).

What I wrote above was simplified reasoning to help the poster above me. I could win by AMD price increase and no large IV drop (delta vs vega), or I could win by IV increase and no large IV drop (vega vs delta). I won both ways, so I cashed out and waited for another opportunity.

Now, today AMD IV is way down but the delta exposure saved me. since AMD stock price is way, way up (delta/vega was sufficient and gamma is more spread out among strikes at further expiries, and other convexity considerations.

It's really hard to buy an option like I chose with the parameters I had in mind at a global maximum price. Hope this helps.

Funny how when you go look at the map of the election results, and click state by state, that outside of the Northeast and blue dots on big cities, the vast majority of the country is red, but the preliminary results say Biden.  
Don't forget the difference between the popular vote and the electoral college.  Bush/Gore. As predicted months ago, this still appears to be on course to be decided in the Senate and the SCOTUS.
This is why we need the news, and why we need them to stop having such clear political bias so they don't already lack credibility when they become most important.

China is imposing capital requirements for ANT that is going to crush or inhibit the credit side of its business, where most of the money is earned. BABA is a good buy, but it's not a great buy at this price without the value of the ANT IPO factored in, and if Ma has become the target of hostility from the government. Don't forget to keep an eye on that last part. He was singled out for punishment with the internationally humiliating cancellation of ANT IPO 2 days before its launch.
You can also split the difference unless it's just one stock / contract. If you're up +200% and sell half, you've won no matter what.

Biden with a clear path to victory.   So no more daily dumpster fires.

Fox News called it based off of projections of how mail in ballots would play out + what districts were still low reporting. A highly educated guess, but a guess nonetheless. Looks like they're probably right, but that's not how all news desks make calls.

Most D's voted early, so Trump needs to really outperform Biden in order to win states as the vote will almost def shift to the left over the coming days as all the mail-ins are tallied up. Arizona just wasn't far right enough for him.
Could be Trump supporters, could be Biden supporters. Stocks could go up stocks could go down
It was up 5% yesterday.
I bought 100 shares at $18.21 and I sold a 11/20 $22.50 call against them but now it's like straight ripping and I'm like no slow down this is not how theta is supposed to work

I have calls, which means it's going straight down. Go ahead and buy puts if you like money.
Hedge funds sold a lot of their positions last week and this. This may be them coming back in and setting up positions. Couple that with squeezing shorts who decided to peek their heads out after staying away the past few weeks, you get something like today. That's my theory anyway.

At the end of the day, when you're talking about a society functioning, personal liberties cannot take top priority. It's a fun fairytale. It feels GOOD to root for people to be as free as possible. But you can't construct a stable political entity when that's your primary focus because on some level, you need the political entity and the society as a whole to come first. Crisis times that societies have to deal with, like war and pandemics, are horrible times to put personal liberties above the good of the society

Spy 400 by december whos with me
Guess going red today is a pipe dream
I trust associated press and they called it.
If it doesn't get anymore upgrades it might do that, but there's a LOT of new eyes on NIO right now. Its been mentioned on Cramer's show (and he said he missed the boat and regrets it), its been getting price target upgrades (apparently today Citi bank gave it one, but I read that on Stocktwits and it doesn't show up in my TDA feed for NIO yet)

There's also several bullish events coming up, such as earnings on 11/17, and then when December rolls around we'll get production numbers again. I think that's why December/January calls are a good way to go. NIO goes crazy and jumps up fast, as we've seen, but trying to time it can lead to very bad situations where NIO bleeds for two weeks.

Word of advice though, NIO almost ALWAYS dips just after market open. That, so far, as been prime time for entering calls.
Damn all my favorite meme stocks disappointing me on a day like this smfh

Yeah GoodRX says it's $400 retail and $320 after the discount. I couldn't believe it, but it seems that's what it is.

Welcome to WSB. Land of smart investing decisions
Is QCOM a buy or wait after earning?
Doesn‚Äôt matter now. McConnell is in firm control of the Republicans now.
Don't think about losing out on additional gains after you've made gains.  It'll drive you mad.  You're getting angry over not having 20/20 hindsight.  I've lost out on like $30k in gains by selling spy calls and puts too early for small gains over the past two weeks, yet the market momentum kept going the right way.  Take your winnings and move on.  Don't dwell on the past.  If we could all time everything right we'd all be worth billions of dollars for never being wrong.
Wtf are you talking about you only get taxed if you have gains
Yes, I'll have some of that printed money please
Dude we don't make $1M here
thank you for your sacrifice
That's one way of looking at it.

Or when vaccine gets announced and covid fears dissipate, tech is going to drill straight to earth's core due to sector rotation and overbloat.
Some people saying AZ is still in play but Fox News has already called it for Biden, what's the insight there?
You are not alone. Fuck.
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99933% sure that bearishbully is not a bot.

Bro they've said for months wallstreet pro biden.
OK, but him "Supporting the use of them" doesn't mean one GD thing unless he can enact Legislation to adopt sweeping change. Change happens slowly, but speeds up in volumes if there is a document supporting its use.

How do you think he can translate "supporting the use of them" to something concrete, that leads to widespread adoption of the technology? It won't be incentives, because Senate won't support that. Now if we're talking about the same old take from the American public where democrats need to enact Legislation that R's support, it will only happen if the R's coffers are lined, thereby removing the ability to reinvest profits into the sector as a whole. It will be a pay to play model, with greasy pork barrel politics dictating the slow rate at which EV support will move. If there isn't anything he can tangibly do, EV adoption rates will trickle as they have since we had this situation with Obama in office where he only had Senate support for the first two years of his Presidency. After that, he was stopped from getting much done because the Senate stonewalled him.
Good problem to haveü§°

you're right, the correct term is packed

Of course, the US Constitution calls for politically neutral courts that represent the general populace, but I guess the Constitution is only important when Republicans aren't in office.

MMs brought the market down last week to help shuffle Trump out; global "lockdown" fear was misleading as most countries locked-down were already largely in a state of lockdown. They cashed out for $$$, now get to ride the run up. When stimmy + vaccine converge its gonna go parabolic.
We're living through the "moment of truth" in Soros's reflexivity theory.

The market. makes. no. sense.

Everybody, even WSB realizes that now. It's not stimulus, it's not the Fed, it's not anything. It's just unadulterated euphoria backed by literally nothing.

This won't end well for bulls.
You might be picking the wrong direction
interesting company, never knew it existed. ive never done a call option before, watched and read a lot how they work though so im kind of an expert now. what call did you buy?
Dude, i already hold back tears when i take ubers around san francisco sometimes. Sometimes i look in the back of the suv and see groceries and blankets/pillows aka, (driver lives in his car)..... actually not even just guys, ive seen grown adult ladies who are nearing retirement age too.   Fucking sad.
All these people saying "The market likes Biden" are idiots.  We were mooning hard last night when Trump was a 6-1 favorite.  The markets like a split House and Senate.  Pres doesn't matter at that point
Since the spy is going dumb, would it be wise to buy puts because if Biden wins I think it will go down a bit but I think it will go down tomorrow based on the uncertainty of the election and the spy is up pretty good today. Or am I dumb?

double top for nio so i can cover this damn weekly lmao
I think it's maybe partially that but also that polls are just stupid and don't work. Most polling is telephone polling, and who answers unknown or blocked numbers these days? The response rate hovers around 3% according to 538 and it seems like the responders skew left but the amount they skew is unpredictable and different per class/region.

Polling is and has been full on broke, so 538's model is full on broke, and Nate Silver should be demoted to Nate Bronze and find a real job pumping gas or something.

Or we can just keep funding all these statisticians to circle jerk eachother.

See how fast you can insert a stack ballots into a scanning machine. Now see how fast it goes when you first have to pull each one out of 1-2 sealed envelopes, and supposedly make sure signatures and address match the state records.

It's wayyyyyy slower.
at this point idk man. can‚Äôt be logical when doing this shit.
Lmao you should have followed the guy with the $300M yolo calls
yeah, it applies to profiting from puts. took me months to learn this.
There was probably a running assertion that if Biden was elected in the landslide predicted, that the would be blue senate instead of a split/red one. Joe himself is probably fine for the market, slower growth but lower volatility, he also runs the very real risk of dying in office. The closest parallel in the modern era that I can think of is Regan in his second term (and the running assertion that he had Alzheimer's through most of it) but his VP was uber experienced in federal level politics and through being the DCI the previous head of the deep state. Not sure what the assessment is on Kamala other than she's had a meteoric rise.
Usually "X is free money" means Inverse = free money in general.
So guess who bought VISA puts right at the bottom today, guess guys. FUCK
There‚Äôs not even going to be a big stimulus market says fuck it we will make our own
Why‚Äôd I buy puts expiring Friday like a dumbass now they are fucked
And I have silver leapsü§°ü§°ü§°

*Thats not true. Guess what happens when you try to traffic kids accross the border? They get caught. Who are they supposed to return to? No parent is going to claim them once they get busted or else they're in deep shit*  


1) This is not a point you are going to win. I have enough evidence to dig your hole on this issue. For christ sake, there is a clip of Attorney General Jeff Sessions making jokes and gaffs in prepared speeches that \*\*ICE is removing parental custody of children who came with their mother and father as a punishment for disobeying immigration laws.\*\* 

&#x200B;

*Then why is he defending pre existing conditions?*  


2) This is not true in the slightest. You are free to look up the record of how Donald Trump and Republicans explicitly tried to repeal the previsions installed by president Obama. The only reason why this did not happen was because Republicans Susan Collins and (Prisoner of War AKA "loser") John McCain voted against their party lines. Without that, preexisting conditions protection would have been completely fucked and there isn't a single shred of evidence to suggest the contrary

 

*\*Then why are taxes going up for the average joe under biden?\**

3) Taxes are going up on Americans making more than $400,000 a year, that is not average joe money. Biden has explicitly specified this several times.   


 

*\*What do you suggest? Green new deal? lmao. Only solution is nuclear\**

4) I am 100 percent for nuclear, doesn't help your case when Trump has been running on "clean coal" for the last 4 years.  
I am not an expert on climate change. I am simply competent enough to recognize competence. The entire alternative and renewable energy infrastructural supporters have been unwavering in their support of Biden. Meanwhile your dipshit candidate is tweeting shit like "climate change is a hoax" and "windmills are ruining the enviroment"

 

fisting the economy by doing so.

&#x200B;

5) take a look at the current state of the economy. the entire reason why most americans needed a 1200 dollar stimulus is because an unexpected 500 dollar bill would have bankfucked most Americans. If biden makes incremental changes in changing the wealth disparity in this country, that's enough for me. Please explain to me why most americans should support a candidate born out of opulence and arrogance over a candidate born in the trench of the middle class.
When was the last time SPY went up by nearly $12 in a day?
Fuck you dkng
How is it even possible for SPY not to come back down to Earth even for a fucking moment. This is the most infuriating market day I've ever watched.
Realized losses: 140 on VXX calls.

Unrealized gains: 6k

I can live with this. Thank you, Joe and Don.
If you're thinking it then most people are too

It could be a giant short squeeze
Royally
I had 352cs for Friday that I picked up last Friday in case of a face ripper on election certainty.  I sold out Monday up 20%.  Thought I was smart.
I‚Äôm wondering the same thing. I sold my 40c 11/6 near the top, but I want to get back in...I‚Äôm looking at $37
Rkt why aren‚Äôt you playing along this run up
Imagine not buying calls on this rally. My only regret was buying 5 calls.
The real question is do I hold COSTCO calls through sales numbers today? The answer is yes
Remember $NIO crash and burn on Monday? This is a buying opportunity.
I learned this very early on - whenever people are saying VXX calls are free money, they are usually very wrong.
[deleted]
Elevator up, stairs down.
My election GRWG gamble is paying off nicely
Not really getting the logic on the covered calls. Were you just expecting it to stay flatish through the PS5 and Xbox release date? Or do they expire this week?
I live in those red states, there's no one here
[deleted]
The Senate appears to be going in Republican favor.  If the house is mismatched with the Senate, historically legislation doesn't get passed through because the bill can't make it through both.

If Biden were to win and the Senate is Repub controlled, none of that AOC craziness or socialistic legislation will ever make it to him.

I hedged just enough QQQ puts in the scenario that there was a blue wave.  They are getting killed today, but I put 10 grand on AMD/MSFT calls so all is well.  I'll be closing the QQQ puts as soon as the index retracts a bit, and I would do the same if I were you as they are most likely going to .01 in this timeline.
Stonks only go up
Apple $124 by Friday
User name checks out
Because I'm on WSB and decided I wanted to light $800 on fire. Already stop lossed out. :D
The sky is the ceiling.
Well you see what happened to the guys who bought puts a few days ago when they were certain the ‚Äúmarket was gonna tank‚Äù for the election
Not sure how people even live there. Unless you're a tech bro you'll probably have a better quality of life being homeless there
everything up so much im afraid to buy in to anything
I told y'all to fomo into GRWG
It sure seems to. Biden was polling really well, and it shouldn‚Äôt be this close. Hillary polled very well in 2016 too.

It‚Äôs almost like millions of people are afraid to admit that they will vote for Trump when polled, and then vote for him in secret.
The actual Wisconsin website may be a better source of info
top is in
Damn, who bought NIO weeklies at the Peak today? 

Smooth Brain move right there
No point in trying to short this
And Republicans probably hold Senate and spend the next two years ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù and blocking legislation with the idea that Biden is holding the bag for any bad outcomes.

Winners: anyone served by status quo (big tech)
Losers: small businesses, local governments, businesses hoping for big infrastructure projects, etc.
Trump has to hope Biden doesn‚Äôt get more than 62% of the remaining vote in GA, or else he loses GA.

Best of luck man, it's fine. Everybody loses money.

QQQ calls was a good play this morning
My SPY 333p 11/06 all have me crying
I think the aggregators will always do a better job because it‚Äôs basically just a larger set of data. The problem is super partisan (or stupid) polls making up a large percentage of it.
Sorry man, I think you have to be retarded if you think the pump we‚Äôre having now is or isn‚Äôt proof of the stock markets being good during Biden‚Äôs presidency.
Buy the rumor sell the news. Or for bad news, the inverse. Sell the rumor, buy the news.
Holy shit
whats in you portpholio ?
Too early to call

don't do it

wall street doesn't care who the president is  they like the split congress because of no tax reform but a stable Biden economy

if Trump wins they love the pump Donnie brings
Probably mid 40s but might be hard to recover after lackluster earnings which are expected

I‚Äôm gonna regret not gambling during the election aren‚Äôt I? AAPL $7 from Monday.
Avoid assignment.  Sold calls when they were ~1300 pts in the money.
Much more stable tho.  And with GOP Senate as it's looking like most likely no big corporate tax changes.
You already collected the premium when you sold the call.

Now all that happens, if you do nothing, is that either you keep your shares (if not exercised), or you (automatically) sell your shares at 114 for a profit of $4.26.

I hat the actual duck
the market isn't some oracle that predicts the future or a partisan that prefers one party over another. It's a ledger of bets and that's it. Betters hold cash before election plays out so they can make smart plays depending on how things shake out. Whoever wins, markets will jump after.
Tanker gang  
Cruise gang  
Gold gang

Buy puts if Biden wins-gang
Maybe. But I can guarantee the majority of citizens are 100% against it.
Dont look too into it. A one day sample size isn‚Äôt likely to be any indicator. If Spy hits 375 eow when we can say something is up
There‚Äôs always another opportunity, is what I‚Äôll repeat to myself to resist the fomo
They only get taken away if the option is exercised by whom ever is holding your call option, but yes if exercised your shares will be sold to the option holder at $114 per share
Oh my god UNH
Wtf are yall getting everything is so green rn only play i see worthwhile are nio puts
this is a vicious rally lmao. people must be getting destroyed today

Convince him to long foreign stocks (ETF/mutual fund, not NIO or some retarded meme) and bonds in his 401(k). Not as good as mixed US and foreign holdings, but much less retarded than cash. Also, should be easy given his uneasiness about US politics.
Bears plan on a Biden win causing a selloff. But Biden winning is appearently bullish. 

Regulation, Repeal of corporate tax breaks, Tech on a chopping block.

Not sure why this is going up besides for blatant fomo
buy NIO when it hits 38.00
I do believe you‚Äôre right
# Don't be afraid to dream BIGGER. SPY $356 by 3:59
Clear answer. That‚Äôs all the market wanted. Dude Biden and trump are both corporate sell outs. Wall Street knows they‚Äôre good either way they just don‚Äôt want a civil war.

I was thinking same thing

the fed is the most important piece, you are right

but think of it this way, a broken economy + fed printing was able to give us the strongest rally in history

what do you think a good economy + fed printing will achieve? its gonna be holy fuk gains

Doesn't take much to win those states with populations of 17 humans and 1,000 cattle. The electoral college is ass and should have no place in 2020.
honestly surprised it's this green considering it's this close.

it would make more sense if there is a super clear winner but there isn't

Biden is about to absolve all of wall streets sins for the past 4 years.   They need him.  Spy calls brrrrrr

I understand this. However the investment in clean energy and support of clean energy and electric vehicles doesn't require legislation. He can and will simply support the use of them as well as pass any legislation he can.

that kind of happened to me in an ethics course. the professor was an arrogant asshole

The market is going up Bc this is closer than expected which means no blue wave

Congrats on buying the top
will this stock keep going up over the next year?
Why tf would you do that?
Yes. Just hold thru expiration and do nothing. Do not buy back your call just let it expire.

JD
I'm gonna be honest guys. I don't give a fuck about who is winning or why it's up. I want someone to beat the shit out of me for being a pussy on Friday and not buying calls and telling myself to wait 2 weeks.

Buying as it tests $40.. it's not rigged you should've expected that.
This is America. Greed is always the winner.
what makes you say that?
SPY is up $24 in 3 days, from fridays close to now. its insane. I figured we'd head back to 350 after election but its not even over yet.

FTFY
Did we think it would go any other way?
Which one of you is musket man?
He is.
Joe can do whatever he wants on the surface.  Red senate means he can't do whatever he wants wrt sweeping regulation to bring down tech. That's exactly why Joe + red Senate is probably the best case scenario for the market.  Red Senate is already 100% confirmed.

Dumb question here sorry I‚Äôm new to theta. 

Got assigned on my Aapl CSP last week with a 109.74 cost basis. Sold a 114 CC this week. If Aapl closes above 114 on Friday, I collect the premium and the profit from 109.74-114 on the shares but they just get taken away. No matter how high above 114 price goes. 

Correct?

Ive done 10 AMD calls ever (like dif dates not contracts) and theyve never failed. 

Current position: 11x 90C jan15 $1.98->3.35.
Biden is about to take the election last minute and Trump is already getting his voters fired up calling it fraud. Vix calls seem too obvious here
"mail it in for her" aka throw it in the garbage

same sheningans as the fake ballot boxes that popped up all over cali
that means you are being challenged. if you can deal with it thats a good thing
Okay if Nio tanks I‚Äôm sorry bought some shares rofl
I mean overnight there were like 200k Biden votes and 100 trump votes.   Also, there are more votes in Detroit than there are registered voters. Lol

I'd venture to say it's a waste at this point, today. Prob best to wait for a small pull back at least, then hop on.

Thanks TD you‚Äôll never clear my deposit huh
I took a small bullish position on Lemonade.
If Biden ends up on top (which it is increasingly looking more likely) then he will have a difficult time moving Legislation through in the Republican-controlled Senate led by Mitch McTurtle. So then we're looking at maybe getting things passed via Executive Order but who knows if Biden is willing to use that sort of power the same way Trump was.

Anyone holding CRSR through earnings tomorrow?
I got it for $2.33 each so that's what's keeping me afloat right now. The other ones I bought 6 weeks ago and they have tanked hard but starting to bounce back up.
So nice of NIO to have a $1 pullback after I buy. 


Go figure
If your not playing weeklies no reason to be worried lol, we are fucking up 35% percent this week
+1 for you.
It's almost like he works there.

Thoughts on why treasury yields are down so much while stocks up bigly?
I hope this happens because I haven't collected enough and stonks just gap up.
Mostly cuz in my experience libertarians are weenies who get off on not being 'a part of the old system' and end up espousing really unstable views in the pursuit of muh unlimited personal liberties
I'm holding through tomorrow. Felt like the drop was timed too perfectly with the next two weeks events coming through. Shake out the week hands
Problem is trump cults are clearly okay with election fraud/interference, that‚Äôs why they intimidated campaign vehicles and voters

Well, the 1st thing Dems did to Trump was delegitimize his presidency. Trump is just returning the favor. I would do the same and I have scruples. Trump has none. It's the only move. Grow up.

I‚Äôll admit that a 3% MOE is pretty insane.

Or.... you‚Äôre not the only one that was thinking the same way, and a lot of traders were üåà for the election. So stocks dropped. You weren‚Äôt some kind of genius with the idea to sell before the election.
Big money loves ITM calls because they have great delta and low theta. When you're trying to turn 900k into 2 million, super long out calls ITM is the way to go. You just need want a 2x, not the 5x that most degenerates here love.

Surprise, surprise: the market likes Biden.

Yeah I probably won't sell. But damn it's tempting
Wrong sub... 5%? This is wsb not Investing
imagine trump losing the popular vote by the exact amount of people that died from covid
For the most part there was a few republicans that wanted the stimulus to pass so I can see the majority of them voting to pass it cause they want to be over this battle and go to the next item in the agenda.
Biden has a good chance of winning PA/GA still
We are touching 350 tonight

Nio got cock slapped away from $40
His tax policy exaggerates wealth inequality in the country. His health care policy is non existent. Solar, wind, and other renewable energies are also good options in addition to nuclear. His social rhetoric is inexcusable when he is encouraging people to kidnap a democratic governor and minimizing science in the middle of a pandemic so I wouldn't be so casual about it and play it off like it doesn't matter. Trump doesn't have a spine, he's a bottom who likes it when Putin barebacks him

a contested election wont do shit, biden will turn the economy around, AND on top of that we have powell printing a trillion a year, this is going to be such an easy next 4 years, its no surprise the market is foaming at the mouth right now for a biden win
look at the open interest, there's way more calls than puts chief

No chance of increased corporate taxes + a rollback of trade protectionism.  Stimulus doesn't really matter. Those two positives are far bigger impacts over the long run.
Looks like it's up to the SCJILF to decide this election.

Markets are rising as it becomes more likely for a Joe victory. Anything could still happen, but at least we're benefiting
What dems are claiming voting fraud in 2016? Not really a common line I've heard.

I hear about dems constantly losing despite winning the popular vote, and voter suppression, but those aren't fairy tales.

The Vix once again, has fucked me raw

This election is starting, to look like a draw

Another day, of anxious uncertainty

I am so good, at losing money inadvertently
400 end of week
I know, but I really thought market was awaiting federal decriminalization and nothing less !
...because so far it looks like a split congress. Biden if he wins will have to fight hard to break them up and tax them with a split congress

Stonks will explode since Biden is friendly with China and all anti-China restrictions will be lifted. Time to go super long on Chinese stocks.

Who was saying the market was going to tank??? We‚Äôre printing $2T no matter what.
It's actually insane how close this is.  If you just followed social media and most mainstream media, you would think Biden would've destroyed mango man.  Just shows how many people hide their political affiliation because of potential backlash

lmao so Donnie spends all his time telling his autists to vote in person and now is questioning why all the mail in ballots are for biden. that is fucking rich
true story, +300% during obama

started trading back in '09-'10 and one of the first things I did was buy SPY with margin

still my most successful trade to date. and the heydays were 2008-2016.   
2016-2020 has been a nothingburger in comparison.
I wonder what it would feel like to not make the wrong play every single time.
[deleted]
Yo, that makes sense.  I've thoughts about this too.  Makes sense to play nice until now
The aggregates like 538 were fine (but had a uselessly large MOE) but the polls were absolutely frauds. ABC/WaPo had biden at +17 in Wisconsin (!!!) only seven days ago
I have 310 p 11/11 I averaged down AGAIN this morning. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm fucking delusional waiting for a circuit breaker
I can see us even hitting 350 by EOD. This shit is crazy, I'm sitting this out for now.

Rubio.

And I would note on the party poll that I dont vote by party.  I vote by candidate.  I voted for my republican congressman and multiple republican state positions, a Democrat senator, and a Democrat president.
Just took profit. 20% not bad.
# trump and bears in shambles
He is 100% correct though, wealth and IQ test scores are positively correlated. 

There are many reasons for this, the main one being that wealthier families have more resources and time to educate their children than poor families. Wealthy areas typically have better schools as well. This is not saying that having money makes you smart, or that IQ scores are a good judge of intelligence, but wealth and IQ are definitely correlated. Actual smart people also tend to be more successful than stupid people, obviously there are exceptions to this but generally it is true.

Who in their right mind is continuing to hold puts
A family friend of mine who‚Äôs a teacher got called 4 times last night to ask if she wanted to vote biden. They said if she agreed they would drive by her house to give her a ballot and ‚Äúmail it in for her‚Äù since the deadline was extended. She lives in PA.
What trading app is this
Yeah that RINO's final act was to turn Arizona blue, the total failure of the McCain family is complete now, at least they are done as Republicans.  Now all they have is fake sock puppet Ben Domenech to place hold and parrot establishment talking points on Fox, until a real leader comes a long.  Looks like the Bushies on Fox did what they do best, lose.

With a Trump loss, Republicans are doomed for a while, while the Dems stuff their families full of cash because they tricked enough of the ignorant poors to vote for Sniffy, the guy who can't even speak a full sentence by himself.

On the bright side the return of the Dems rampant corruption will most likely be good for the market, Sniffy sure isn't taxing the so called 1% they already bought him, lol.  Let's get this party started! üéâ

Twitter is a symptom. The information age is here. Humans are not evolved to deal with it AT ALL. There needs to be a way taught to kids in school on how to parse information. The brain is interpreting things like the person is standing in front of them. Meanwhile on the internet you have shitposting, trolling, misinformation, things said with zero thought, stupid people saying a lot with too much thought, smart people staying the fuck out of it all because lol, emotional ‚Äúfact‚Äù manipulation, biased reporting, biased interpretation, new human to information interfacing that has never occurred in the history of mankind... etc and I could actually go on. We need to really break some things down into their separate parts and help people understand what they‚Äôre looking at. All information isn‚Äôt created equal. At some point we will need to teach people how to judge what they‚Äôre reading and when to personalize something you read online or elsewhere

APPS was the surest bet I've seen in a while, basically free money. They smashed earnings (beating their own guidance, not just the street) and only dropped 50% due to the macro environment.

Currently up 220% and still rising, with $30/35 calls expiring in December and January.
üí™
RKT earnings date is Nov 10, next Tuesday. It is expected to be their best quarter ever. Currently trading at $20.88 on a \~8% pop today.

I'm bag holding a bunch of shares at $27.xx.  Chances it gets to $27.xx between now and earnings?

Thats not true. Guess what happens when you try to traffic kids accross the border? They get caught. Who are they supposed to return to? No parent is going to claim them once they get busted or else they're in deep shit

> trying to repeal healthcare laws that have been critical to the protection of pre existing conditions.

Then why is he defending pre existing conditions? 

>further disparaging the severe issues in wealth inequality by subscribing to ‚Äútrickle up economics‚Äù bullshit that republicans have been peddling since the 80s. The tax cuts did nothing to ensure American stability of wealth during his administration.

Then why are taxes going up for the average joe under biden?

What should he have done differently that other countries haven't tried to do and failed to do so? Unfortunately turning the US into a small island like New Zealand isn't an option

> fisting the economy by doing so.

GDP up, stonkies up, sounds good to me? You know what would really fuck up the economy is shutting everything down which the CDC and WHO have both said is not a solution

SPX calls, strike/exp don‚Äôt matter $$$
There are 50k idiots who voted for this idiot. This is unbelievable
Market just wants a winner, doesn't care who, the more likely we have a definite decision the more bullish.
To be clear multiple news outlets have still yet to call a lot of these swing states.....

I‚Äôm sorry mr Biden, I don‚Äôt even smoke
They killed VIX again
Maybe "lOwEsT BlAcK uNeMpLoYmEnT!" wasn't a good strategy for Trump lmao. 

Blacks are not the ones who got him there in the first place.
Half my gains are on 2 AMZN 12/18 3200 calls and if there is any single company to be long, I think it's AMZN hands down! You're dead on tho, shorts have to be surgical or they fuck you in the end. The market was oversold going into the election and we got rewarded big time! Cheers brother.

The 61% thing starts happening and everyone is like ‚ÄúThe pollsters are FRaUDS!! Numbers are all astrology!!‚Äù

And the fact that people give death threats for supporting the other side when it really isn't that big of a deal
It‚Äôs because Biden and Obama are both actually conservatives pretending to be woke and bring change

you're not making a self driving electric car or getting to mars on 'common sense' and 'gumption.'

This is public pandering to look like he appeals to the every man but he's not hiring someone w/o a degree on anything important.  The fact that this sub eats it up shows how stupid the masses actually are.

maybe if you want to sell tesla/spacex gear at the giftshop he'll take you on.
Only thing more bullish than today, would be a nuclear strike on half the US according to this market.
If he loses, yes.
Twitter already has created Biden‚Äôs official presidential accounts and have declared victory. GG.
Correct
Not so dumb. He can't prop up the market for 4 years if he starts with a rally.
Big question is when will that happen. Timing is everything.
Then plan to put his in your mouth too to keep your secret.

Does anyone have a logical explanation for why the markets are exploding when the election is going to be contested ?

I'm not a Trump supporter by any means but what is it with liberals wishing death on Trump and his supporters? Almost half the country voted for Trump, so just because of their voting choice, they all deserve to die? Trevor Noah posted a gif on Twitter yesterday as a "joke", implying that Florida should be nuked to oblivion just because they voted Trump. What the fuck is wrong with you people? If you all want a single-party totalitarian nation that badly, you're welcome to move to Russia or China.
Def a hedge...

It is great when you are on the long side and the market keeps chugging along.  Nothing wrong with being short but you have to be perfect on timing. 

Congrats.  I am up big as well and I am happy I went all in and bought the recent dip.

I'm so pissed I passed on buying Friday thinking this week would be a shit show. Literally had MSFT and AAPL orders and just didn't click confirm.

Twitter has been a failed experiment and desperately needs to be shot in the back of the head twice. Even IG and Facebook are more benign when it comes to tearing apart a country.
I don't want a con man president. I want the softer touch of a con artist

If people think you‚Äôre an asshole for being successful (as long as you obtained your success through honest means) then they‚Äôre the assholes.

Trump going to tank the markets by announcing he was in cahoots with Russia just to spite everyone who didn't vote for him
was $27k when i bought :'(
edit: after seeing it go down to 21k i got out at 28k
1) separating children from the families of refugees as a putative measure against immigration 

2) trying to repeal healthcare laws that have been critical to the protection of pre existing conditions.

3) further disparaging the severe issues in wealth inequality by subscribing to ‚Äútrickle up economics‚Äù bullshit that republicans have been peddling since the 80s. The tax cuts did nothing to ensure American stability of wealth during his administration.

4) not giving a single shit about the health of this planet. Discrediting research from NASA, NOAA, Department of defense regarding climate change.

5) consistently humiliating america on the world stage

6) completely fucking up the covid response and fisting the economy by doing so.
You're only confused about who's winning if you're watching Fox News....
McConnell straight not fucking that he will be GOP leader in Senate - minority or majority.

If he's minority he should let someone else be Leader cuz he lost it
Thank God this is a normal election cycle where we should expect everything to stay the same
How come no one said Republicans winning senate would rally tech stocks?
$40. Good luck big spender
So dumb haha I basically bought at peaküòÖ thanks for your advice though.. I hope it‚Äôll go back up

Hey guys quick question not related to stocks, but I figured you guys would know your Vyvanse well lol. My buddy lost his insurance until January and says without it it's $320 per month for a prescription. That's matching up to what I see at Kroger. Is that really what it costs out of pocket? That's like $10/day. I had a generic anti-depressant a decade ago and it was like $15/mth. Poor guy makes $13/hr. I thought there were channels for low income households to receive medication.

Yeah, bull rally‚Äôs usually start this way
You think markets wouldn‚Äôt just correct soon after? I wonder if his tweets would have any potency if he loses. You know what I mean, like they have power because he‚Äôs the president, once that stops threats and things like that can only take you so far

I mean like you said technically will be sitting president for 2 months but threats as a lame duck can only go so far
LOL.... you put the chimpanzee in the bottom picture in a suit, that's so adorable

This is the fattest bulltrap i've seen in a while. Bears already been shook out.

Bad news= Good news. Good news= Good news No news = Good news
YOOOO
Big nio put order in. Hop out now
90%+ of MI has voted, when they have never passed 70%.... hmmmm.... people be filling ballots for others
If he had mandated or at least advocated masks and not intentionally used his influence to discredit scientists and convince people that they didn't need to wear masks then he probably would have come out of this looking a lot better. His maskless rallies alone are estimated to have killed 700 people. It spread through the white house after holding a maskless party. Scrapping the previous president's pandemic preparedness team right before a global pandemic was also not a good look. It was a no win scenario but he took the worst options.
What a f day to be a bull
Wall Street backing Biden.

Up 30k today and it feels SOOOOO good. FUCK YOU GAY BEARS! GREEN WAVE!!!
This shit is so goddamn rigged
...PZ.... lemon squeeze
The senate remains resoundingly red, with McConnell winning re-election, which means the green energy agenda is dead. Red senate reverts to the Obama Republican strategy: absolutely no bills get passed. No agenda is too small to filibuster. The polls suggested a blue sweep, which was extremely bullish for renewables. Now renewables r fuk
TAN was down 6% this morning.  It‚Äôs coming back from the grave
Ez gains
They called Texas too early, even 66% of the 16% remainder is enough to win and it‚Äôs all mailed at this point. Would expect that to be blue even in rural areas.
Nah we going to the moon

Do you guys seriously think Biden will be good for our country?

Sorry who's actually fucking retarded?
Cause they're the party of small businesses right? That's why google, amazon, apple, twitter, and Facebook all want them to win!
Yeah wtf, I was about to buy $37p
I had a debit spread going into earnings. Bought back the short leg not long after earnings and am now riding the long leg all the way up while selling weekly covered calls against it. You could just rethink your strategy rather than write it off.
The idea is to make money tho, one move in the other direction and you're fucked

Console season. More partnerships coming out soon possibly. Hedge funds are slowly taking away shares float, lowering it so that at some point, shorts could be forcefully squeezed.

Also it‚Äôs like ~170% short, most ever shorted stock by a long shot, short squeeze is why I‚Äôm in mainly

I kind of suspect they crush er since everyone and  their brother decided they'd use quarantine to "get in shape".  I'm assuming the plebes bought fitbits in droves. I further assume about 15% of them actually worked out more than 5 times, but that doesn't matter, they bought the things... I think... hell, I don't know. EXCELSIOR!!!

It's OK to be bad at reading dude. You're not good. That's fine....

I use 50% of ALL funds on options.... If you. If you can't even fucking trade stocks that's pathetic. Not asking you be able to handle options, but you're pathetic if you think you actually were "derisking" going to cash. If you think that's a trade, pay a fucking management fee and stop playing this game, you suck at it.
Guess have to wait for the next big dip to buy in

Someone explain to me what the fuck is going on.   Really.  I‚Äôm not even bullshiting at the point.  How?

Biden has been in law for 47 years and has done jack shit you truly expect this man to be a great leader? üíÄ üíÄ man has no balls üèÄ trump is all balls no penis
Is the market up cause Biden‚Äôs gonna win?
Biden wins WI, MI, NV, AZ easily. Maybe PA too. This isn't over only in Donnie's orange head.
This proves market is fake as fuck ty
Well that's not gonna happen. If Biden wins he'll close the country again and if Trump wins then rioters will burn even more Wendy's to the ground.

retard confirmed on the day of IPO.  bought in at $24  =/
They wont be able to even get a bill thru the house themselves.so there's no real offense except for dems as it has been since trump.  The red senate will just be defensive from anything coming from the blue house.  Anything red that comes up will be vetoed and to get anything passed it will have to be bipartisan, meaning big bs laws where both sides want a cut of the pie.  New tax laws will likely pass
McConnell is going to ratfuck this

Bollocks. He never liked him. Completely used him and thrown him away. And Trump is too stupid to know. I can guarantee you McConnell is a friend in private with fellow long time senator Biden. Mango though? McConnell probably hates him just slightly less than Dems do.

Takes too long to drive into the boonies and get their opinions.
Let me tell you all something hella fucking cool. Bought me AMZN OTM 3235c 10/6 for $800 on Tuesday. Sold that bitch for a loss yesterday when I panic sold that morning for $550. What‚Äôs that call worth now? $4,450. Yeaaaahhhh boiiii
If it finished green tomorrow I'm buying 1DTE puts for 5% OTM
Lets see what is justifying this rise

This market is so fucked. The two worst case scenarios are still on the table: (1) contested election, and (2) Biden win with R senate which won't be eager for so much stimulus. And now, a huge possibility of a 270-270 draw has emerged. In which case, from what I've quickly read, the House elects Biden and the Senate elects Pence.

And markets are up 4%? What the fuck?

Just hear me out. They announce earnings today ah.  The options atm are basically free. (less than $5 each.)  Throw $20 at it and you can get calls and puts at $7.  Then they just have to either beat or miss er and if they don't, you spent coffee money on it.

Idk man I think the jury is still out on that. Portugal‚Äôs overdose numbers have been on a pretty steady rise.

Decriminalizing is only a small part of it. You‚Äôre not going to see meaningful change unless you provide an extensive and robust form of rehabilitation. Id argue that we shouldn‚Äôt decriminalize but rather reform the punishment. Instead of throwing people struggling with addiction into one of our overcrowded prisons, we place them in a mandatory rehab program. But that would be very expensive to institute

>Danger is Biden dies in office or becomes demented

i don't think this is a real concern. we elect old fucks every time and every time people say "he won't last, he'll die any day now" and then they live another decade or more

and Biden having dementia seems like it's not a real thing but just a way for the Rs to try and smear him since he stumbles over words a lot. watch him speak for any extended period of time or watch him in an interview or in debates he seems like at worst he's just kind of a weirdo, not senile

Not really, it's just a backwards way of making money. You sell a covered call and the stock goes down; so you essentially subsidized some your losses. If you weren't going to sell your shares then it's all good. The only pickle is if you should sell another covered call because now the shares are down, so yeah you might miss out on gains if it blows past it again this time.

What do you mean? 
Time is against you if you buy options. Time = Theta. 
Theta is always negative, so if you buy a option with -0,10 theta, that means the next day your option is 0,10$ less worth if the stock opens at his previous close. 
Simply said, but that‚Äôs the theory. 
There‚Äôs still volatility that you need to take into account. 

For writing options, theta is in your favour. This means you gain 0,10$ a day. 

Go to r/options if you want to learn more about it.
Let‚Äôs go!

*Laughs in Mandarin*
I have been watching Nio since it was 17$, letting it skip past me. Don‚Äôt know it may even go to 100$
Biden by a razor thin edge is a good outcome IMHO. Provided it is proven legit and not fraudulent. Why? Senate stays Republican and Dem majority in House much reduced.   


Will force Biden to tread carefully and avoid the loony left getting carried away. Gets rid of some of the Trump excesses and allows DC to focus on COVID19, economy, healthcare reform.   


Danger is Biden dies in office or becomes demented. Harris is too left wing to be good for USA.

I'm never doing a theta play again. It's the surest way of losing money.

You lose money when market tanks, you lose money when market moons, you even lose money when it's flat because VIX decides to moon out of nowhere just to fuck with you. When VIX moons, your theta positions bleed like fuck but when VIX dumps, they don't regain shit. Theta gang is just a way of giving away your money.

Ya just put in a call for Feb with a strike of 36. Cost me $1k, but I‚Äôm sure it will hit 50 a share before then. Was just hoping for a dip.
Bloomberg really ought to go fuck himself
Would‚Äôve been absolutely insane
Triple top incoming ??
My SPY 1/21 330p are down 50%.  
Do you hold or sell?
On a somewhat unrelated note, I've always thought the "Hotel, Trivago" was such an effective slogan and I don't even understand why (it's like saying Hamburger, Mcdonalds). But any time I think about booking a hotel I was think about Hotel, Trivago
fucked the economy pretty good and historically incumbents never win re-elections when the economy is in the shitter
BETTING odds favouring BIDEN 80-20
its alright nio, you earned some rest dont worry baby
on think or swim it in the options statistics category
Honestly if Trump had just stfu about petty shit it would have been a landslide but he can't
It is obviously mostly conservative and only a whiny deluded loser can‚Äôt see that.

Downvoted by fragile little baby snowflakes with shit for brains.
It's nice having NIO so I make money no matter what craziness happens today
Take your political bullshit to the other thread that the mods created.

intentional misreporting lol
Yeah it‚Äôs scary bro. People no longer have a need to communicate with others in the real world, cause odds are they have differing opinions than you. So rather than facing the other side, it‚Äôs much easier to automatically discredit it as bad and wrong and then go back to talking to your online friends in your echo chamber.
could be older data from 2020. source used data from '2020'

Well, keep saying it then!!!
Where when? How do we even come across these need before a 40% jump?
Hey does anyone know what Biden can do if he is president and senate is red? I think stimmy will pass because republicans don‚Äôt want to be the ones stopping it. But what about clean energy stuff? Taxes? Can Biden sign executive orders for those?

I went to junior college and then transfered but took open university courses. My full college costs at San Diego State was under 10k...

For buy and hold (long) holders, they say that 10 trading days in the year make up all your gains for the year and if you miss those days then you will have a hard time getting a good return. 

Although this is a strange year, I think today is 1 of those days.
NIO a pump and dump?
NIO reminds me of the old TSLA days.. Great times.
It's based on their net income.  Duh.  If you lose 10 billion dollars last 12 months, don't you know it goes up 2000%.  Duhhh
20 years later, Florida is the gold standard for ballot counting. We have Jeb! to thank.

Isnt it great to have someone who can release his taxes all the time just like all other presidents. Instead of making false promises to release them for 4 straight years? Or not gut the IRS budget??(ik it wasnt trump but it was GOP)

Republicans dont like transparency

With Biden win with his climate plan, TSLA leaps definitely a good idea. Maybe another EV will be pushed ahead, except NKLA
What strike? I have $10 leaps

They claim that they‚Äôre reporting it but it‚Äôs clear that they all have their biases that they use to skew what they‚Äôre reporting and how they‚Äôre reporting it.

no fucking pro-constitutional judge worth their salt is gonna halt voting

Oh shut the fuck up. It's only been 12 hours. The retards who think we need UN election monitors should actually go spend a year in a real banana republic.
McConnell talks mad shit about "blue state bailouts" for living in a state that keeps getting money from the Federal government than it pays in.
Okay? If it's legitimate then there's nothing to worry about. He'll contest it and get told a second time that he lost fair and square. I still don't see where all the doom and gloom is coming from.
Dood just think about it. What is the white people equivalent of looting? You think they're not gonna vent
It‚Äôs truly funny to know that I sold 25 40c weeklies on NIO for $150 loss üòÇ paid $16 a piece now they $150 a piece
I need 340 today
Last election everyone was terrified about the outcome and many predicted market would crash once trump was declared winner. I think futures went limit down the night of the election but then reversed and started this bull market.
does it matter if stonks go up?
Yeah sure nothing fishy here
literally sold some SQ calls at 130 IV

wdym ??
The gay fish was just.... testing the waters this time
they'll probably mellow with donnie's possible exit. still won't watch them
Looking at the chart I would hold a bit, it looks like it is going to come down in price/
IDK if it will drop back below $85 but you might as well just hold to expiry if the premium was decent

Buy your shares back at some point, I don't think JD is going to go parabolic
I like NIO too, but I just bought puts on it :)
dont get burned with puts?
Bloomberg spent millions paying court fees for felons in FL so they could vote Trump.
I can believe it, I always lose money on VXX

haven't you been watching this country for the past year?
I'm too tired to think clearly.... Nearly fomo'd into NIO

Dear Trader,

A massive amount of uncertainty has just to been removed from the market. The presidential election is over and the pandemic and the Great Depression are about to become ancient history.

Stocks will explode to the upside.

The investment opportunity of the century will be here‚Ä¶.again, for the second time this year. And believe me, you want to participate!

Some $14 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus is hitting the economy. That‚Äôs more than the government spent to win WWII on an inflation adjusted basis. What happens next is that you get a Covid-19 vaccine and cure.

It‚Äôs all setting up a ***Golden Age of American Investment*** and another ***Roaring Twenties*****.**
Deadass, Wisconsin has more votes then registered voters LMAO. 75% of mail ballots went to Biden but in the end 100% of it went to Biden 0 to trump. Dems are cheating.
Lot of lessons learned here today.

TL;DR Dont bet against the USA.
BABA starting to rip back up
Biden wins MS and WI = Trump calls lawyers and supreme court recount to contest election

Biden loses MS and WI = Protests, Biden 100% also demands recount and supreme court decision. 

Both results end in gridlock, stagnation of true voting outcome, further delay of stimulus.

I'm about to go all in on IWM 12/18 puts if we break 346 and no REAL positive news is declared.
I'm not really sure the virus influenced much. It has been a rallying call for both sides. It mostly just pushed people to more extreme left or right.

He's the one that put doubt in the right's mind about the virus, effectively dividing the nation which all but ensured that the virus wouldn't be contained. The right fucking complained about wearing a simple mask citing rights when they never gave a damn about their fellow Man. no empathy from the death toll rising because they didn't want to wear something on their face. What a joke
It‚Äôll come don‚Äôt worry. Everyone is just FOMOing into tech right now but your day will come.
We've had early voting and mail-in voting for decades.
TSLA calls
My exact feels when the profit calls on one of my NIO positions slipped through and cashed out at $38
no usually democrats when they enter office generate a red day or two. with how volatile the market has been under Trump, swings are widely expected. Most are expecting big swing down then the market rallies following it. Short term bad. Long term better

until Biden wins and Trump shits the bed, looks like the market will keep rising

I think we can all agree that Bloomberg has been turned into the ultimate cuck over the past 365 days

Yes, they seem to be extremely paranoid about resources lately, with the overfishing and loan traps to 3rd world countries. The only way to really contain them would be to limit out of natural resources they can plunder from the world.
Yeah, don t look back and sniff around for the next big win. This market has new hypes every month.

I shorted TSLA this morning at 430.... target to cover is around 400 - 410 - my thinking is there was a huge run up due to the elections - people will start taking profits between now and December before everyone jumps back in and gets ready for the next stimulus package.

Why is everyone so sure Trump will crush the market on his way out? It's the one thing he can always point to, even after he leaves office to troll the Dems. It's not in his interest for market to crush between now and Jan 20. If anything, he should want to take it to ATH before leaving so he can shit on Biden for any drops.

Nio puts?
Gonna need to buy new underwear with these Nio gains because I can‚Äôt stop cumming!
We will raise your taxes, market says if I pump hard enough I don‚Äôt care

I‚Äôm buying calls don‚Äôt care if I lose all my money fuck puts
Holy shit dude! What a turn around! I honestly didn't see trump loosing after the way florida Ohio turned from blue to red. And yes you're right. I kept wondering where this extra 1 electoral came from, it's from Nebraska. Folks on CBS explained how it can be vital to win and share electoral votes in that state. I think Maine has similar setup too, but not sure.
Just woke up. RIP to anyone who chose TSLA over NIO.
Yup, it was a ploy to get people to mail in vote
So is this sidelined money entering back in?
Agreed. He was so adamant on getting her in before election. I didn‚Äôt get why. Now it all makes sense. He‚Äôs a million steps ahead of the game
Whos a biggest republican supporting group than farmers?

Somehow their mental gymnastics allows them to think getting subsidies to sit on their ass and not grow a thing is not socialism. [They love Trumps trade wars because hes giving them record subsides and aid.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/us/politics/trump-farmers-subsidies.html)

I havnt seen bigger hypocrisy than this
I appreciate it, thank you

How can you be a sore loser before you even lose?
Little depressed I sold some of my NIO calls thinking it would dip by mid week. Lost $300 on a put option, but I‚Äôm still up $1200 gains. I knew NIO was a win, but it just keeps chugging along.
NIO is scaring me
Market be gambling not logic this year my man. I‚Äôve been cash for 6 months. No stress been great.
Why would concede an election he won at the polls before all these random ballots showed up.

Real problem here. Don't forget the influence of social media either.
My puts could use some Donnie tweets rn
CRSR
See the comments. There are more registered voters. The tweet isn‚Äôt accurate

 dont sell, hold strong. every dip is a buying opportunity
WI has more votes than the number of people registered to vote. They can‚Äôt even cheat properly üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Why are people so down on the market right now? It's ripping to a possible Biden victory. I thought Trump was devastating our economy. Why wouldn't the markets react positively to a Biden victory (if what we've been told the last four years is true)?
put election on side, don't forget JPow will speak tomorrow afternoon
NIO holy shit... just dip a little so I can hop again.
why did we dump last week then?!
The Control of the Senate probably won‚Äôt be decided until a run off in January for Georgia.  Look don‚Äôt get me wrong I do think a stimulus will be passed eventually only because the government will shut down on Dec 11th and I‚Äôm sure they work it in.  I‚Äôm just mad I‚Äôm out of $ to buy puts.  The rally today outside of the FANG names makes zero sense.  Meanwhile I‚Äôm slowly accumulating a loss porn for you all that will be cemented come year end.  FML it only took 100 hours of extra duty shifts at Wendy‚Äôs to get here.
Mango fucked himself by ripping on McCain for no real reason

Yes, for sure. I pick the wrong stuff every time. 100%.
turning against mango
Yeah it's looking like a Biden win. You should go to r/politics and r/conservative anyway just to see how truly crazy the diehards of each side are.
Buying puts is a mistake with something like this
Don't worry, Haris is the real winner here.
Always has been
Everything is bullish who cares
it is just an illusion
I think the market is too hyped given where we are.
More like the Michigan Sexy of State!
Funny how that works.
When is that
I have puts on snap because meme stock is well due for a dumping but dont give a fuck because nio calls are making me cash baby
True if big
I think what you are referring to is a insurrection / civil coup to over throw the government based on radical ideas not shared by the vast population.... then in that case sure.... but other than some crazy cult - the military is made up of citizens from the population and will share similar ideas that will ultimately lead to a fragmented military - so the next civil war will be US military vs US military supported by civilian militias - just like before.
yeah, happy that i took profit but i could have taken MORE profit!!
We cooming
MI Secretary of State definitely has downs
XPEV and Li are running off NIO and that train is rolling
Hope you got in PAGS. 47 EOM
This is true. As a üåàüêª I can‚Äôt deny this market anymore. Breadth may be soft but it‚Äôs improving and it‚Äôs always been pretty bad. Just hope I get a vol spike at some point to get out of some of my positions
Holy fuck NIO
NIO FOR PRESIDENT
LOL UBER UP 13%
If he scores those but loses WI, AZ, MI and NV he lost barely. 

Y'all really need to start messing around with this map and figure out how the shit works: https://www.270towin.com/
Mine looks like that but upside-down.
Damn you fucked up
Didn't say I believed it did i?
Well they changed the rules right before election. Otherwise there would be no early voting or mailed in ballots.
There is a lot of angry people who are missing the NIO üöÄ to the üåô

NIO you retarded son of a bitch keep pumping
No. I won‚Äôt make that mistake again. After I stop buying puts and just started buying calls. I can‚Äôt stop winning bigly.
What the turbo fuck is happening with NIO? Why so high? I like it, but why?
So is Covid gone now?
Based on recent days, once it reaches 10% up, it slows down, so you might earn a little, but it's just about there
Lmao are you dumb
Is BABA puts a good choice EOD? 

It's mooning now, will probably moon till tomorrow when they release earnings and crash. 

Couple with devaluing IPO for Ant, might be a good idea to buy now sell and short end of day don't yall think?
Got 39 that sold and rolled into 42 for next week.
HLYN going to run up too, get onboard y‚Äôall
Lol those are old numbers my guy, they have 3.6 million now and in Wisconsin you‚Äôre able to register when you vote.

WIsconsin allows same-day registration. The number of registered voters hasn‚Äôt been updated on the image that dude tweeted. Stop with the fucking conspiracies

I think "within". Like peirsol or perimeter.
I haven‚Äôt looked into it much but didn‚Äôt XPEV deliver 3k cars last report compared to NIO doing 5k? At a quarter of NIO market cap it would look like XPEV has room to run
But only Trump claimed victory prematurely so this is inaccurate

You guys realize if Donnie loses he‚Äôs still gonna win right? 

Remember Gore VS Bush in 2000, and an ‚Äúerror‚Äù with ballots? The decision for presidency was left to the Supreme Court. 

Mail in + Covid are the ‚Äúerrors‚Äù for this year, and guess how convenient, he just put forward a new justice on the Supreme Court last month.

Sure sure bro you seem totally unbiased to me...
I bought 31 contracts that expire next Friday with a $35 strike when it was $33. I didn‚Äôt think it would skyrocket this fast in 2 days...lol I owe you guys one.
I'm seeing puts volume increase steadily over past hour.

and also 20k and 30k calls but they are mostly empty with no puts at that strike point. 

I see 36 incoming.
[deleted]
I‚Äôd wait if I where you but it went up almost a dollar when I first told myself that
You‚Äôre completely right. Him winning those without PA would have led to a 269-269 tie too if he didn‚Äôt win the 2nd district of Nebraska.
sold NIO put, got scared and bought it back. $10 profit... ohwell..
Not at all it's literally free money :)

what were once seen as bearish events are now bullish

is the nasdaq first circuit breaker 5% or 7%?
Hello and hello
Wrote a JD 85c last week. Buy it back, roll it up and out, or wait until Friday to do anything?
People that like huge risk/reward, I'd take a look at a 1 day chart of GEO and look what it did when it looked like Trump might win overnight.  This is a stock incredibly volatile to the outcome, meaning if Trump can gain any traction that he still has a chance it could move tens of % in value.  Calls are not fluid but they are relatively cheap lotto tickets. 

Just sharing, I'm not buying.  I'm not a big risk guy and think the election result is becoming relatively clear.  I'm monitoring Michigan votes, however, with GEO on speed dial.
social media has also served as echo chambers for people to become more divided. everyone sees their news feed full of things that confirm their bias and then everyone starts to think "how the fuck could someone POSSIBLY have a different opinion than mine???" puts on america
The NIO calls went from 80k volume at strike price 35 (premarket hit)

After it hit, the volume went down to 16k with no puts at the same strike points.

This is from analysing data from my site:

Blame it on a lack of education. A large number of people are unaware of how "the media" and other sources are affecting them. They arent aware that they're being manipulated. That their inner fears/biases are used against them for the sake of empowering the few.

Will he be offering refunds on options purchases?
No by not making it a left vs right thing saying its a hoax from the Dems for weeks citing low numbers when it was known it has a long incubation period and therefore allowing the virus to spread more effectively. After it broke out it was too late to contain it and everyone knew it which is why the best course of action was to stop it as much as possible early. 

If you literally can't see how Trump made the Pandemic worse than holy shit are you fucking blind, sucking Trump's dick cause he appealed to your inner sense of a bully who takes no shit from no one. A good President unites the people and doesnt constantly blame the other party for his own shortcomings. Do you really believe if it was Biden in the office he'd be calling the virus a Republican hoax? Of course not like wtf who does this shit
This was basically the same way Tesla has been and I got fucked by not buying Tesla for this very reason.  I kept thinking; Look at Ford/GM no way Tesla can go higher when they make so few cars.  But everyone else that bought Tesla got the last laugh.

Nio is just Chinese Tesla and have a market cap that is currently 10% of Tesla.  No reason Nio doesn't see $400 per share price in the next year or two...
Next level clown shit
Virus is here to stay, it is not going to go magically with Biden win, yeah he may take it more seriously, but what are his options, he cannot force people who dont want to wear mask to wear mask.unless he forces a complete lockdown things are going to remain same

That‚Äôs literally my point just agree with their view and I get an A but everyone in this thread is but hurt as fuxk for some reason
As a completely unbiased holder of SPY 344/350 call credit spreads, there is absolutely no chance that Trump doesn't send this market careening off of a cliff with a mid-day Twitter rampage contesting the results
Just math from your example:

Trump has 0.6\*.64 = 38.4% total vote share, Biden has .4\*.64 = 25.6% Total vote share

Biden needs X\*.36 = (.5 -.256) to win.

So he'd need to have 67.8% of the remaining votes to win Pennsylvania - consider that the uncounted votes are mostly mail in.

Considering the President went on an attack on the legitimacy of mail in voting it doesn't seem crazy that Biden gets 70+% of mail in votes.

That being said, I haven't looked at the numbers, and am assuming that the numbers from your example are correct.

Just woke up in PST, and i don't believe what I'm seeing on AP map. Is Biden actually winning this!? Shows current is 238, he's leading michigan (turned blue overnight) so that's 16 + Nevada 6 + Wisconsin 10 = 2 fucking 70! 
Don't even need PA in that case WTF!!

Then the Trump guy got behind them to tailgate them and the car started break checking the Trump guy. Shit was stupid and reckless for both sides. Puts on this country. 

Fuck the media and social media for actively trying to tear the country apart.

Lol I like the Nostradumbass.

I believe he wants the SC to mandate a halt to counting on grounds basically saying "all votes brought in after election day should not be counted". Kinda makes sense as we have an election day, not an election month.

But, afaik, there's no laws saying when votes have to be counted by. So, legally, all the votes yet to be counted are perfectly valid, his campaign is betting on most of the remaining votes to be for Biden, so he wants the court to side with him and declare these currently valid votes invalid. Which to me is a hallmark dictator sign
I bought a little SQQQ at $20.34 for a day play thinking things might regress toward the mean a bit the rest of the trading day.  I have no idea what the final 15 minutes brings on a day like today, however.

That's the classic republican playbook.

Have rich special interests get a republican elected, the republican sets up a bunch of things that make those people even more rich, but aren't sustainable long term, the economy, market, jobs, etc all crash eventually but not immediately. 

The republican lies and takes absolutely no responsibliity for it and they get voted out and democrat gets voted in.

Then the crash happens and the democrat is left to clean it up. 

Then republicans complain the whole time that democrats can't run anything, because hey look the economy isn't doing as well. 

Except most times when a democrat is elected, main street actually does well. 

But then a republican gets elected.

Looking at the charts the top 10% KEEP getting way richer and the bottom 90% keep losing money. 

They've figured out the the perfect grift.

So clearly fucked up. You'd think they'd still throw in trump votes as not to raise suspicions. nearly 140,000 sudden votes for one is basically impossible.
Maybe it went better than you thought.

Bought some MSFT puts and 1 TSLA put.

You‚Äôre welcome bulls.
I think the next 4 years were going to be crappy no matter who wins, so arguably it's better for the Republicans to have a Democrat in office then. I think the economy alone is going to be in seriously bad shape no matter what. Covid might not be much of a problem if a vaccine comes out before Biden takes office though.

You Americans are truly fucked if you have a "number" of day trades you can do. With my broker in Canada there isn't a limit lol

Hell dude I‚Äôve called countries shitholes. Some countries are shitholes.  But calling people who died for your country losers? I can‚Äôt defend that. Not sure what prompted it but man... shit sucks
I'd say calls. There was a sell off because Democrat controlled Senate isn't guaranteed yet. Someone's been pumping them up over the last week and a half, volumes up but the prices were stabilized. I think buying pressure resumes really soon and you'll see a pretty big pump in IV.
You will lose everything on the line for $BIIB
What they seem to be doing I believe is trying to dollar cost average their shorting and cover slowly over time - usually one day per week.

The best strategy is to inverse theirs. Sell a portion of your positions when it pumps from this behavior and buy back when they drive it down again.

I keep dollar cost averaging my positions down doing this. So, managing longer term risk while remaining significantly in this for an expected larger pump.

Edit: it also seems heavily a fight between the big boys. I don't think most of the longs are in any rush to pump this to infinity though - I think they're quite content to collect interest and also allow others to buy in at lower prices. Potentially even sets up for more aggressive potential deals or maybe even an acquisition.
Guess who held puts all through this face ripper of a rally think Covid, potential riots, and election uncertainty were bearish 

Silly

Just another shithole. Mango man don't no care.
I dumped mine and am looking to go long on the next pullback...uvxy play was contested election and it looks like that's not gonna happen
Buying BABA's dip yesterday was so obvious. I'd guess there's a real chance the Ant IPO takes place in America now given Ma's disdain for China at the moment. If that happens, Ant will run up like 300-400% on its IPO day and BABA will boom more than ever expected
BABA recovery initiated, Biden + Earnings + Singles Day - calls calls calls
It‚Äôs Alright man
Market Positives:

No major blue wave means no major corporate and individual tax increases likely to occur in the next 4 years. Regardless of whether Biden wins, he won‚Äôt have congress on his side to push a blue agenda.

No major stimulus aimed at supporting state budget deficits. Muni debt implosion could be good for treasuries. Fed has to monetize less debt. 

Inflation risks lower with less printing, bond rates fall, debt remains cheap for stock buy backs.

Gridlock = more of the same.

More of the same = stocks up

Don't copy paste the same comment on multiple posts. It makes you look like a low IQ peon. If course, what you're saying is patently false, since every single state that halted counting ballots has a Democrat governor, so why should I be surprised you're saying retarded things.

> you think Biden and Harris are any better oh boy.

I just dont want to hear Trumps voice ever again
Its very likely, yes. Not over yet.. there have been some surprise margins like in Miami Dade. I'd say its like 85-90% Biden now.
You realize either candidate would be the oldest in history right
Erroneous. They should have more counting volunteers then
Believe it or not, but a lot of people with money love the idea of a republican congress with Biden as the President.  A lot of people think Biden will be just like Clinton and Obama.
Why can‚Äôt you trade options on margin on Webull? Time for me to go back to robinhood?
Who knows at this point. 50% have prob priced in a Biden win and 50% a mango win

so nothing is priced in

That‚Äôll be the day
PA had something like 2.5mil mail in ballots requested. There‚Äôs still a lot of votes to count
Lmao u mean big loss, bidens leading now
They'd take a new fucking virus seriously so that's a huge upgrade over our current president
No way he's going for second term.  Around year 3 he's going to be pushing Kamala as the incumbent choice

Would losing this election be more favorable for Donnie? Give Joe the second/third wave of the pandemic and beginnings of a recession. 

Obviously if Joe handles it properly, Donald is fucked. But you hand over the ticking bomb and come back to clean up four years later, Donald could be playing 5d chess. It's going to be hard especially if Republicans control the Senate again for Biden.

Agreed. The polarization is exacerbated by people unwilling to consider alternatives. I won‚Äôt agree with someone 100%, but at the end of the day I‚Äôll give them floor to discuss their points and state where I agree and don‚Äôt agree. But I‚Äôll hear them out because that‚Äôs the respect anyone deserves. It‚Äôs unfortunate that as soon as someone raises a counterpoint it‚Äôs either ‚Äúokay Antifa BLM,‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrump supporter, bigot.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs also disgusting imo to see the identity politics occurring, at least from my small sample size. You can‚Äôt expect someone to grow up and believe something just because they were nurtured in that environment. As soon as that individual ventures out to not even concede a point of a differing argument, but just look for what else is out there, they‚Äôre immediately disowned and chastised. Unfortunate times right now.
Seriously dude. I‚Äôm treading dead careful right now.

Dems explaining the 100,000+ mail in ballots being 100% Biden reminds me of KODK insiders explaining to the SEC why they thought buying $1M in OTM calls was rational.
and the weird chinese exchanges are leading by a good bit. thats been a good sign of bull in the past
Nio is the ONE to save us all.

Not gonna lie I cannot believe that came out of his mouth. I‚Äôve said a lot of stupid shit in my life but I want to imagine I wouldn‚Äôt dog on dead vets even drunk. Trump I love you man I voted Republican but that was the biggest of oofs

NIO new TSLA
I  sold  NIO 39$ Covered Calls 11/06. Stupid of me?
All true. However, stock did see a decent boost back in March when oil prices crashed. This was followed by good news that they were charging record rates for storage on their tankers which lead to a bigger bump in April. We could see a similar situation in the near future.
I am cash gang waiting for all the disputes to begin to buy some calls.
A lot trade in .05 increments. More liquidity maybe
Wall Street Bets Fraud Department is going to start investigating these Trump accusations. Stay on the line
trade deficit is higher under your boy than at any point under obama or clinton.
The chumps at r/conservative are actually fucking retarded. I just someone comment how Oregon is going to be asking for federal help when they get an opioid epidemic cause they voted yes on hard drugs. Opioids!?!?! You mean the drugs that are already legal and available everywhere, especially fucking FLORIDA!?!?! A red state !??!??!!

He could have said "take it seriously, wear a mask, we'll get through this."

Instead he said it wasn't a problem, it's going away, the doctors are wrong, Fauci bad, and refused to wear a mask (and mocked people who did).  Basically if he acted like a president rather than a child it wouldn't have hurt his so much.
If you think you‚Äôre going to buy into NIO at the top.. it‚Äôll probably go even higher

I don't think that will happen. That's one of the main reasons why Trump is so popular in rural America. Joe Dirt thinks that Trump will hand him a job at a factory on a platter. "let's go back to how things were in the good old days when China wasn't fukkking us over and all these illigal immigrants weren't taking our jerrrbbbs". Rural America is honestly a powder keg waiting to blow.

both, it matters what sectors. Oil is gonna get burned because Biden is a big believer in renewables and green energy. Although he isn't against the oil and gas industry he just believes that eventually we will have to transition away from it. Which we will have to at some point.

I like JD regardless, I think many of the same arguments for AMZN and BABA apply, but JD has more room for growth if they keep improving their margins. 

I'm not saying buy JD on BABA weakness, but that it's a better alternative given the risk present. Normally I'd say JD is riskier than BABA but now it's the opposite.

Also, China is the only country which I think can comfortably say is post COVID socially and economically.

I mean feel free to do some research but this is the basics: 

 Millions of people voted early this year and the states that are still counting weren‚Äôt allowed to do anything preemptively (thanks to republican state legislative). So now they have to go through millions of ballots, and in many cases compare signatures. The states that counted early votes preemptively did so quickly. It‚Äôs not fraud, it‚Äôs just a shitty system the remaining states decided on.
So... MI and WI gonna go blue? What now?
Why? Shows trump winning

Truly yours is the essential point. 

To fail to speak to each other implicates a failure to listen to each other. Together they constitute a failure to communicate. In the absence if communication we invent out own fantasies internally and listen to those instead. Internally may be in our own heads or amongst the set of people with whom we do communicate. Given enough repetition those fantasies, and the failure to understand their contingencies and fantastical nature, people begin to believe them. Before long, they become our reference narratives upon which we act and move in the world. So the fragmentation begins.
r/investing is that way.

Can't afford it, but I think that might be a solid play.
That's a good point.  I am just referring to my anecdotal experience that every election people complain about the electoral college, but only if they lose.  I personally think it's a good system to keep the cities from ruling the giant land mass that is the USA, but wtf do I know
We aren't really much higher than when the drop started. We just got back our gains from a few weeks back. People are front running the next bullrun because they know once the election ends there is much less uncertainty left in the markets.

Agreed and that's why it would be even better. I don't think Biden even needs it at this point. If he wins Wisconsin, Michigan, and Nevada he's at 270.

>With the electoral college large swaths of the country are ignored because they aren't swing states. 

>‚Äã

>With a popular vote candidates would actually have reason to go to California, Texas, New York, Indiana, states that get no attention otherwise.

Your logic is exactly backwards. No, they would not visit, advertise or campaign in these areas bc logistically and financially it's inefficient.

And campaigning in swing states already speaks to the majority of the country that's moderate and tends towards purple.

Furthermore why would the executive and their cabinet worry about allocating resources during the administration if vote density isn't there? Let's say there's finite amount of resources, which there is, why wouldn't a president or their cabinet focus on Chicago or Phoenix instead of Kalamazoo or Joplin?

And thank God the founding fathers had this foresight. Do you really think it's prudent to alienate the majority of the country where food and meats are produced? Where logistical hubs exist? Where durable goods and manufacturing thrive?

It would only serve to further divide the country and grow the wealth gap. Robber barons would rise, elitists on the coast would feed on the fat and middle America would shrink.

No eliminating the electoral college is naive and myopic. It's dangerous and foolish and to support it bc your current candidate or political leanings would benefit is stupid. Shit changes and accountability is important outside of our own views.

Yes, absentee and mail in. In person votes are counted immediately and early drop offs first. So more likely Biden will win by a larger margin.

And they're up almost 20% today....

I ain't touching that, puts are still expensive
Jan calls at 35 - 14k contracts.

What happens to the MAGA cult now?
Long on puts on anything
Is that why oil companies are going up?

Three positions in my skinned down portfolio: DE, GBCI and CVX

Naturally CVX the only one up
Stay in it bro. We haven‚Äôt shit the bed yet
Regardless of who wins, it will go up bigly before it goes down.
Don't.

Stock  market wants Biden to win so bad
Sold NIO too early today like a tard but w/e, whats the next play bois?
Go away shh
Biden wins , China stocks rising and you can never say "all lives matter" in public now. BIDEN 2020
Biden picked up 1 in Nebraska.  He only needs Michigan and Wisconsin.  Whoever gets 2 out of 3 on the Wall will win this.
how upset are the üêª
Lost 40k a few weeks ago my GF to be wife soon because i love that bitch called me a pussy and said just hold it you‚Äôll be fine because you are not a üåàüêª. Just got back to even today

muh calls are bleeding on this super green day TWTR needs to get their shit together
What earnings you all be in?
If you actually looked at the number OP was referring to you‚Äôd know there were Trump/probably Jorgenson ballots in there
too many puts flowing in for NIO now. I'm out with a good profit now. trade at your own risk at this point now unless you bought it at a lower price!
How long do people think it takes to "count" votes?  You slide the ballot into a machine.  Each person should be able to do 4 or 5 per minute.  With a 1000 people it should take 4-5 hours to process a million votes.  

So is it fraud or incompetence?  Do these cities have one old lady responsible for scanning the entire city's ballots?
U belong here ‚ù§Ô∏è
GOP strat for 2024 needs to be get someone who isn‚Äôt autistic and keep courting the Hispanic and black vote

Internal panel said yes, independent panel to meet on friday, then FDA to make a final decision.

I hope they release the data out there for the world to see, because so far the data has not been convincing (it's been more in the camp of fairly safe at the designated dose but no real efficacy... Which FDA has played that game with Sarepta a roving a useless drug due to patient advocacy). 

I'm glad im disorganized and didn't pull the trigger yet. I'm officially going to star away, and pass on this play.

No i am from cash gang and i wannt buy NIO but its so high now its it too late?
Mail in votes aside, all that needless McCain bashing came back to fuck Trump over.
pump it pump it
They read something online and thought the world was collapsing on Nov. 3
Being an asshole isn't illegal, so probably zero.
Spy is going to 400 this was the predestined course.
Not sure what to tell you there chooch. RGR went up about 700% during Obama‚Äôs term.
You‚Äôre maga retarded it was explained many times
People in Nevada really chose to vote for "None of the Candidates"
TSLA and NIO are following the Beetcoin and ETH bubble. Beetcoin pumps to an ATH at 20k (TSLA to 500) then sells off. ETH pumps to 1.4K a few months later in the wake of the Beetcoin pumps with tons of hype and enthusiasm, right before both epically dump, kinda like NIO is doing right now. Dump coming soon.
Bullish. This implies at least one side would accept defeat should they not reach 270.
Ye!
Me actually I did
200% won‚Äôt get me a lambo
Is that why he didn‚Äôt want to get subpoena?
Trumps stimmy would have been straight away but smaller. 

Eventually, probably in the new year sleepys stimmy will be bigger but a longer wait.
Double top incoming
Tell that to all the poor white people in rural America who keep spamming "they took our jobs".

Why do BLM protesters dress up like the terrorists I fight on Call of Duty?  And the people waving American flags around are known as racist un-Americans?
Live feed of Trumps twitter:

Probably will do at the end of the day. Just hope tRump doesn‚Äôt say something stupid. Feel the gains today are here to stay though.
Puts on the climate.

Dude where do these stand after the bump? I got some 341C on 11/1 thatre doing decent but can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôre seeing if you have any amount of delta/gamma

He‚Äôll be fine, he got his family rich **af** during his term, I think it‚Äôs somewhere around 1.3 billion
It‚Äôs what you claim. They updated trump‚Äôs lame 10k first followed by Biden‚Äôs ~140k. 

Hillary won Detroit with 95% of the vote and they‚Äôre acting shocked Biden got ~93% of the vote there
If only it crashes first right before inauguration, like Obama‚Äôs

That‚Äôs the problem, both parties are the same. They‚Äôre both in favor of big government.
For fuck sakes guys NIO WILL MOON BECAUSE BIDEN HELPED CHINA‚Äôs ECONOMY BE WHAT IT IS TODAY w/ the trade agreements decades ago
Maine is looking to give Trump 1 electoral vote, that puts Biden at 269 with Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, making PA a must win to avoid a tie
I love how the election is being preceived as bullish for equities.  Republicans keeping the senate = small stim.  Biden win is bullish for equities how, exactly?  The only reason markets like Biden is because of a large stim, but won‚Äôt happen due to senate.  But ok, buy equities and pump the market
Are spy 309p 0dte going to print?

asking for a friend.

/s
Biden getting WI and MI, also NV. Not too sure if those states are needed to win and reach 270?? Yesterday, these states were red-leaning but when i woke up, holy shitttttt it turned blue.
Played NIO twice 2 days in a row. easy 550$
Honestly this thread should be used by psychologists to study the effects of anger, dread and denial. The rightists just can't accept reality rn and are convincing themselves its all fake because it can't be real unless their narcissistic bully wins.
Last Friday yup
I think it‚Äôs mostly republicans winning the senate. Tax increases are DOA now
Twitter down because the only reason anyone uses it is to follow mango. Good buying opportunity?
Knew it was gonna be close, but regardless of who wins man this country needs to learn how to listen to one another. Both sides are culpable. No active dialogue nowadays
Someone poke god damn TSLA

Whats everyone doing with the Baba calls? Holding through earnings seems risky as fuck lol but the price upgrades everywhere seem bullish
Idk what he was supposed to do though? Lock down immediately and tank the economy. 

Ignore it and watch the death tolls skyrocket. 

He hedged in between those options. It was a no win scenario
**Breaking: Scientists reveal entire Trump presidency was a large scale sociological experiment, meant to study cognitive bias, and America's resistance to fascist take over. Scientists are concerned with their findings.**
Very cool, very chill, very legal
Yea except trump isn‚Äôt capable of being questioned for days on end and not implicating himself.
NV won‚Äôt swing away from Biden at this point. Trump would have to flip Vegas or Reno county. It‚Äôs going to have to be MI or WI in the last five percent.
wtf has FDA approved anyhting? why
GE to the moon!
Seems like I should have bought instead of sold BABA on the slump
Honestly? Yeah probably. Also pls prove that's the current count
Xpev up a quiet 16% today
Don't go full retard. Everyone knows how absentee ballots work. Republican led states prevented counting them early just to create this situation where you're surprised.

Don't fall for it. The diapered dictator still might win.
Wtf is wrong with TSLA
BIIB - wow. Alzheimer's drug has promise.

weedstocks are about to fly imo. 4 states legalized and looking like a biden win. This is an entry point. CGC and TLRY earnings on Friday. I've got calls from next week into 2021.

The bottom is IN for that sector, just room for growth and sentiment is changing.
Why hasn't weed and solar recovered now that biden is winning?

WHO CALLED IT?
alz drug is fire.

This is something my wife and I both talked about. In the end nothing changes for us. There's some regulatory bodies that will be a little more aggressive in the finance industry that may impact My job but in the end money printer go brrr while we spend ourselves into oblivion. I don't think anyone has talked about deficits or balanced budgets in 8 years. I have kids, if they're screwed in the future, then that's their battle they're going to have to fight. I'm just trying to see how I can make money off some sweet, sweet, OTM options
Fuck, I sold NIO at 38.24 today. Fuck me. Now it is gonna rocket today...
NIO and Biden. Name a more iconic duo
So if elections are fake, Trump didn't win in 2016 then?
Funny how Covid just doesn‚Äôt matter anymore lmfao
Red vs Blue is like Bulls vs Bears, stupid and pointless.

Everyone wants to make money, and if someone does something stupid with their vote/money, let them. The real loser when division happens is America.
Fox News is distancing themselves from Trump and won‚Äôt fan the flames.
i sold just before it started
RIP
this might be the worst day of my life, thank god ill be to drunk to remember it

Live odds for Biden to win went as high as 4.25 at my book when NYT was projecting Trump to win both Georgia and North Carolina.

Even then the true value should've been closer to 2.0-2.5.

I really think a lot of the Trump bettors never bothered to learn how the electoral college works. Driving up odds for Biden like crazy. It's like they were buying TSLA calls on battery day.
new NIO price target $69
I‚Äôm guessing all day drops his breadcrumbs, then - requests recounts and uses the recount days to ramp up the accusations and starts throwing loaves of bread soaked in gasoline... which then - recount comes back the same, throws match
Can you imagine how vicous the fights will be in the runoffs?
Donnie has no friends there. Get over it lol
Lmao you're telling me 130k people decide to vote for biden by mail with no 3rd party or trump candidate in between? lol
Fuck do we sell now or hold till tmr I don‚Äôt like this shit rsi showing we overbought
It was 140k Biden to 10k Trump votes. Which, is... 93%. Which also happens to be LESS than vote share Hillary had in Detroit in 2016 (95%)

Is math too hard for some of y‚Äôall?
Yet
The US doesn't have the balls to do that anymore, and within 10 years they will have enough subs and missiles to prevent that.  Not to mention it would cripple the US economy as well.
Do they think Biden will ban violent videogames or what? GME struggling
Why do you think he's so desperate to stay in the white house
I've had the opposite experience. Most food ordered from them is like 2.5x the cost. Tried to get some wings, fries and a beer delivered. 55 bucks. Said fuck that, called the place for pick up instead... 17.50 for the same order.

I'm not crying. I'm happy! Mango is done for.
JESUS FUCK NIO! GO BITCH GO
Buy them
Beautiful
This week I learned a valuable lesson that cost me 3k- Stonks only go up even if there‚Äôs an alien invasion that would be bullish
ALL IN NIO
too close to say
With Biden winning NIO is gonna fucking expolde even more, even though trump didnt really have a affect on the Stock, now the fear regarding usa and chinas relationship is going to go down and more buyers
Yes, I‚Äôm greedy. 

Yes, I‚Äôll hold my calls despite 400% gain. 

How it ends? Idk man, but I wish you good.
Spy double top at todays high?
Two sides of the same dumbass coin
"I followed" - there's ur first mistake.
39c for Friday almost over 100%
How dumb are you? Dems are against guns. Always have been
ALL IN NIO
Well true to form everything I touched today moved the other way
Yup, now we see where the senate goes
Yes bring the GREEN
[deleted]
I have shares. Shoulda gotten options though
Biden and Trump must concede to Jo Jorgensen
There‚Äôs strings attached to everything
[removed]
This is the moment to buy Puts and VXX/UVXY Calls, Biden is likely to squeak out a win once all the votes are counted, but Mango isn't going to fucking step aside, he'll take this all the way to the Supreme Court, \*HIS\* 6-3 court, and try to hold onto power that way.  All while Murica is going down the shitter, NO STIMULUS BILL WOULD BE PASSED, 3RD COVID WAVE, MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT, CIVIL UNREST..........  Your Puts will print.
RIGGED
looks like the market here just switched to NIO, bruh
True that, thanks.
R.I.P my puts
Did that actually happen? Or someone just take a screenshot before they updated the other half of the votes?
Never too late
You only need a PhD to be a surgeon anyways
Literally probably all mail in, no surprise. Trump supporters ain't using the mail after he shit on them for the past 2 months, wake the fuck up its not rigged you just lost
The entire election was literally priced directly in TSLA
The country is divided and both sides either gloat or cry about everything. This will only get worse when the Senate doesn‚Äôt let Biden do anything... ‚Äúbut yay my team is winning!!!‚Äù... if you aren‚Äôt rich you aren‚Äôt winning, hope your YOLOs work out for you guys.
I just woke up and MI and WI are tilting blue wtf. Is mango losing and that‚Äôs why we are rallying?
I'm theta gang on VXX. Currently lighting money on fire
Right? You spend a fucking year bashing mail-in voting and want to know why your followers didn't mail in more votes?
This will probably be better as 40 by EOD

We‚Äôre getting another ATH today wow
No different than he‚Äôs been acting for the last 10 years
Are we going just range-bound now?
Trump
Didn‚Äôt win yet???
whenever meme stocks don't get a consolidation they get a cliff that they fall off of
Why are the gun stocks down 10%? I thought they were supposed to moon with a dem pres.
I'm thinking about picking some up on discount.  Volatility will happen over the next month with plenty of opps to cash out, I'd think
Omg BIIB through the roof !
Rank choice voting would go a long way to stopping this nonsense. These parties need to be broken up, and my third party vote shouldn't be a proxy vote for the other guy.

This system is bullshit.
LMFAO

Holy fuck MAGATards are a special breed. Really incredible
Will Biden have an Obama level bull run?
Very legal
Got to love phantom ballots by cowards afraid of a virus unless they protesting.

But Facebook told me so
I shouldn‚Äôt have sold $38 calls...
My buddy talked me into buying SPY puts based on the market not knowing election results last night. Boy did he fuck me.
Cant cure retardness
Only way to do that is count all the votes.
You alright? Trump won already stop crying
Oh fuck, you have to wear a mask during a global pandemic? What's next, seatbelts while driving?
But they were legit last night? Lmao moron
Bro Florida is bigger than Pennsylvania and they counted the ballots just fine. Adopt the Florida model then. It's not that fucking hard.
Thats what I'm saying. R may only have 51 which isn't substantial
Hey- at least you didn‚Äôt pick up baba calls like me
that is the joke
Republicans are keeping the Senate. Even if biden wins, he will have no teeth.
channeled my inner boomer and bought CAT today

Bro what is this dumb argument with China???? I keep seeing it like trump doesn‚Äôt suck them off. Is your memory that short?
i find it peculiar that when stocks jump up a dollar in 3 seconds we don‚Äôt call that volatility 


but when it dies down a dollar in 3 seconds


it‚Äôs definitely volatility
This is all we can do. I'd rather lose 2500 entirely than sell now and miss potential profits from mango
[deleted]
Wait, there‚Äôs a county in MI that reported a batch of 130k Biden votes with 0 Trump votes at 3am? Nothing to see here
Im such an idiot. I thought spy puts were easy money this morning. Fml
You‚Äôre retarded. Did you not see Dems leading TX, OH, FL, etc. for the same reason? Only diff is mail-ins were counted first there as opposed to last.
BABA longs
This is gay as fuck
**I, too,** have autism.
Oh yeah, what else about China? Come on, I'm almost there
Happy my puts were at least rolled to January or further yesterday.

I am in genuine AWE of NIO's bull run right now. This is just insane. Its up 30% in five days so far. 86% in a month.
I'd rather have a blue wave or a Trump victory. This is the worst possible outcome. No stimulus!!!
This is exactly where I buy puts but we climb to 357 anyways.  

I jump off the overpass slamming violently onto the hood of someone's car with "Fuck the market" written on my naked body.

I kept telling everyone here the sell off last week was due to portfolio rebalancing combined with fear of uncertainty over elections. I warned everyone that markets will moon after elections as both factors are eliminated.

You can also own 2 huge profitable companies and still be a retard too lolz
And the Left has been laying the same groundwork for years. Let's not pretend like what I said before isn't true. The *instant* Trump even *hinted* that he might be in the lead there were news stories out about how he was trying to "prematurely declare victory". -All this while still refusing to call obvious wins for Trump and at the same time spuriously calling states for Biden that they eventuality had to walk back. This whole thing was set up from the start.
Could send solar to the moooon tho

Don't go full retard. Everyone knows how absentee ballots work. Republican led states prevented counting them early just to create this situation where you're surprised.

Don't fall for it. The diapered dictator still might win.

SPY Put/Call ratio is at 1.38.  There has to be a ton of people that were selling puts knowing the market would go higher or possibly using puts as a hedge.  We have had puts outpacing calls now for weeks.

Thats the trap. 

At some point wsb makes you sexually attracted to risk aversion.

Every day you stare at your static account.  Jerking off to the lack of loss.  Its always the same number.  You are addicted to it.  Addicted to not losing money.

Like a person who was abused.  Traumatized.  You have PTSD and the only thing that can comfort you is the sight of your account staying un-raped.

Everyone talking about scrapping the electoral college like it's likely.  It would take a constitutional amendment, which needs 3/4 of states to approve.  No way republicans let that happen, and they control way more than a quarter of states.

&#x200B;

The alternative is the national interstate compact, which may happen.
He gets alot of noise but the key democratic base doesn't want anyone that radical. They like their republican-lite option
Best part about selling calls rather buying? You can be wrong and still be right.

You don‚Äôt get it. Senate is likely to stay red, so no higher taxes. At the same time, no stimulus and that‚Äôs why small caps and dow are down today.
I can too.

I can't understand being enough of a knuckle-dragger to think that voting for kanye, even as a joke, is a good idea.

Less of a cash cow if he‚Äôs not president
I never bought a put :)
Big oof if true.
Can somebody tell me why SPY puts (like 12/4 320P) wouldn't be a good idea today?
It will prolly go back up. it has meme strength right now.

What is the psychology behind this rally? Very soon the US election results will be out and it can come with some uncertainty. Is there an obvious play I am missing, is it a buy for the diminishing uncertainty after the election fog has cleared and corona has been contained?

What's so surprising? Big tech has been censoring conservatives for years. In this election season alone, FB removed many conservative groups. They only spared the one about women supporting trump after trump intervened.
They really faking you into believing the market will pump with Biden right now. Just like they faked people into thinking we‚Äôd dump with Trump winning last election. You guys are too gullible. For what it‚Äôs worth I want Biden to win, but it‚Äôs not bullish for most of the market.

I am now at 20% cash. I can ride the market higher and I am well positioned if we get a pullback so I can buy the dip.

My biggest issue this time around was that I bought the dip too early.  Need to be more patient and follow the technicals.

My calls that printed today say the market likes a Republican senate. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I actually agree with you but still doesn't explain it boss, especially with how strong it was yesterday

I worry Biden dies and she takes over in those 4 years, doubt dems can control her
ouch
Trumps most recent tweet get fucked retard
Could be 49-51 R after Loeffler possibly loses the runoff. Not enough to block everything. Collins will switch hit given how she nearly got bounced

I wish what you're saying would be true but America is too tribal
His supporters have been saying its rigged when he won in 2016? Oh youre admitting it, cool
Its amazing how many of you actually wager your entire account and are sad when you lose it all, like what the fuck were you expecting? Play stupid games, win stupid.. uh, win nothing at all actually lmaooo
So happy for you ü•≤
Bears and bulls are currently staring at car headlights, frozen in time. Little do they know they about to go to the afterlife
Get yourself drunk. Take a walk. Or whatever. 

Just take your mind off the market.

Y‚Äôall wanna take some profit on AMZN so I can buy back in thanks

Any odds on first news station to project the president? Can I take bet on Fox News because they want to distance themselves?
Im worse. I sell at loss after bagholding for the longest timeü§™
can u stop being so gay ? same answer
It's anyone's race right now.
Market went up with predicted trump win. Then it went up with a Biden win. Who knows but it‚Äôs probably time to buy calls after this settles down
need everyone to start buying puts and calls so that vxx goes up
I‚Äôm scared...Why it no just go up
I want aoc asmr
where do we vote on that?
I hate it here all i do is yolo and lose money
Bro you're good. Having the balls to actually put your money on an election play means you have That pioneering WSB Yolo spirit don't sweat the loss.

So twitter definitely gonna tank if the president stops using it
Who know but i leave you with this: don't count out the nio day 2020 pump in late dec and early jan...they releasing some ridiculously nice new sedans (Google ee7 and et7), new 150khw battery that goes 550miles, new in house ai chip, new v2 battery swap stations....gonna be wild
A large majority of mail in votes and absentee ballots (military/foreign living Americans) are democratic this election. Because they‚Äôre counted later, you‚Äôll see a lot of the remaining swing states start to get closer and closer.
GME puts printing though
Lmao cash gang is always safe
If they‚Äôre RKT calls absolutely not
Why does this feel even worse than massive dumps.
Coolio to write a follow up song to his 90's hit "Gangsta's Paradise". It will be called "Druggie's paradise"
Trump: MAIL IN BALLOTS ARE FRAUD - DONT USE THEM

Conservatards: ‚Äúwhy would trump numbers be down in mail in ballot?‚Äù
You know what you‚Äôre right, have a good one dude
overvalued.
Everyone bearish af
Time to inverse wsb sentiment indicator
Thanks guys

Everyone stop trying to think.... You don't get tendies to think.... Just follow the mother fucking trend.... Don't get cute.

of course itll dip. contrary to popular belief, depending on the time frame you look at, stonks dont always go up
Renewables are down today, BUY DIP FOR BLUE WAVE
If 2+2 has to equal 5 for me to lose money, it fucking will. If I bet money that sun will rise tomorrow, it absolutely won't.

The post office has already refused a court order to deliver some mail in ballots that are sitting in back rooms

Stand back and stand by gravy seal.
Bears were maybe the worst they‚Äôve ever been a few days before the election, they deserve this
You'd've been more pissed if you didn't buy at all, so at least you got in!
1200 bucks got sent to everyone and people who always lurked here went +100% on the first calls they ever bought in their life cause it was literally impossible to lose if you had eyes and then they feel like they‚Äôre part of the group so they post a meme they found on a stock market page from Facebook and now we are here
And as soon as y‚Äôall expect green ‚Äî big red
brr
Just a small edit, Maine's 4 votes are split. Biden will likely take 3 (District 1 and Popular vote) and Trump takes District 2's 1 vote.
Maybe go long on BABA or FSLY, and if market dips short term than it gives you a chance to double down and play shorter dated strikes with better prices
Went from being down 300$ to being up 20$ phew!. Thanks for that little drop SPY, I will never not believe in you again.
No matter who wins the stock market will go up plus we have stimulus after the election
MM‚Äôs are just trying to trap us. Divided Congress and nothing significant will happen regardless of who wins the presidency. Don‚Äôt let them dump on you fellas.
Nobody killing anybody. Look at things this way, either there is fraud or there isn‚Äôt. Let Republicans have their way and investigate. Either Biden won fair and square or not. If he‚Äôs won he‚Äôs won, nobody going to war.

and not in the good way
please stop tweeting please stop tweeting
I just loaded the fucking boat with ccl calls. See what I did there?
There will be so many here who would have bought calls only 5 minutes ago.

Idk if I'm buying stocks today. Might just hold steady
someone give me a $1,000 play right now

So nothing new
There bots
Didn‚Äôt know Pennsylvania still used the pony express
Oh good heavens no. If I've learned nothing else over the last four years it's that the *last* thing you want to do is be realistic. The path to victory lies through being as histrionic as possible. There's no hyperbole or straight up lie too big and no insult too low. Personally, I'm not willing to go the whole, "burn things to the ground, beat and kill people, and steal everything that isn't nailed down" route -that's still a bridge too far, but it's going to be fun absolutely *excoriating* people like you for the next four years. Assuming you're actually right, of course.
of course, he a bitch
Does Trump realize if they stop counting, he loses?
[deleted]
Lol at least I still have my cash üòÇüòÇ
Anyone know why TSLA is so weak today compared to the market?
I switched Friday to calls. Will close all my options today
Still holding?
Yikes! They been said this since 2016. They ain‚Äôt moving nowhere
You can claim anything. Proving it is harder, especially when all the absentee vote counting has been done legally within each state‚Äôs laws
50k is chump change for a civil engineer
They dont. They now have even less cash than cash gang.
True. It‚Äôs the bulls turn next week ü§£
Yes, lol. No one wants to associate themselves with a lame duck though.
calls are on sale. get 'em while they're cheap!
I gotta learn to strengthen my risk tolerance again. Been selling these calls for peanut gains.
Lmao wtf
STIMILUS TALKS GOING WELL....PEN CLOSE TO PAPER....AGAIN?!? PROMISE??? I LOVE YOU BABY!!!
Trump is stuck between a rock and a hard place.

If he moves court to stop the counting now, Biden wins as it stands.

If he moves court to stop the counting later, Biden wins with a bigger margin.

What will Trump do?
[deleted]
Plunge protection team in effect until the election is called and Trump wins.

After that the stock market will crater if Trump loses because he don't give a $#@& anymore.
No, at the time trump made his statement he was leading in Michigan and Wisconsin by "count" which he made the claim to both not stop the count in AZ but to stop the count in Pen Mich and Wis. 

Many states had rules that mail in ballots can't be counted until after election day so people couldnt even start counting until midnight.
I hope he will bring hunter with him if he win.
Happy all my calls are up.

Sad for my Mango.
I think he will hold on in NV. There's only mail in ballots left.
Wont take as long if he uses an air compressor
[deleted]
Logic doesn't work. Bet by heart not head...like love.
Scalping is one of many types of day trade where you look to exploit volatile price movements and the gap in bid ask spread, usually within a minute(s) of entering the trade.......so this entry point would only be a successful scalp if you were buying puts.
Wtf for real, this game make no sense
Congrats to all who bought NVDA below 500.  That was a good 10% gain so far.  I have trimmed my position back to core holdings.
The Democrats will make a secret deal with Putin not to impose sanctions if they take him, that way it will calm down a lot of the right-wing potential terrorists
I am with you. I have been expecting red since Monday.
It‚Äôs ok 40k is nothing when Biden wins we all get government jobs easy laid back 40k + benefits.
I tried that then lost it all when corona hit
XPEV just keeps on mooning... WTF
lol that's exactly what my dad did after getting the macan lmfao
No
All he had to do was act like a human being about it instead of a whiney little bitch. No one blames him for covid. It would've bought him a landslide victory. Even dems would've given him credit.

Deep in MRNA calls for December
At least you didn't go cash gang. Worse than losing money
If it makes you feel any better I've lost 300k from a few months ago. Keep at it.
Maine can split votes. Does Trump take one of those electoral votes and make this thing even closer?
Why I have Tesla and Apple. Bezos dick is like on viagra while Tim and ein looking for viagra
Do it pussy
That just sounds like no stimulus
Yup I'll never make 400k/yr so why should I care. I'd even vote for a 90% tax on income over 400k/yr and close all the capital gains tax loopholes. Oh no the billionaires can only afford 2 yachts instead of 10.
r/ropes
don't worry, you may yet need them. this is just getting warmed up, Biden looking like a win, and BLM just stabbed a proud boy leader in DC .
I don't know what to do rn lol
My VXX calls are torched enough that I might as well fucking hold
Why do u think that? Everything about this move seems safe & sound. ü§îü§£
Lots of states had like two weeks of in person voting...
Not possible at this point I don't think
Maybe the market thinks trump will win in the Supreme Court üßê

He did install Amy üëß
lmao i sold covered calls and made 700 in a couple days yikes
I sold all of my AAPL debit spread for .03-.04
They would have been worth .12 each as of 10am today
Trump could easily have won a hell of a lot more of these mail in ballots if he had taken the pandemic seriously and not made it political the entire time.

You know how Biden failed with the Cuban community in FL? Well Trump failed with the community that‚Äôs concerned about coronavirus. The community that decided to mail in their ballot.

Not illegitimate, not fraud, he failed because of who he is.
That‚Äôs what I said, bonds don‚Äôt usually pump alongside +2-4% market pumps.
did u see spy psychopathic a$$?! 

thank goodness i bailed my 315p exp next week yesterday for -50% prof its worthless

I mean you have to remember that cities are filled with at least 5x as many TV/state programmed subhumans than the number of semi- reasonable, real-life informed people elsewhere. 

Cities with >300k people should have their votes get a 0.5 multiplying factor to make representation closer to fair in this new world of mandatory state indoctrination and mass immigration.
That would be amazing

Anyone who thinks Trump will risk spending a day in jail is crazy. He and his kids will defect to Russia, Trump Jr will be the manager of Trump Tower Moscow, Kushner will run the Middle East operation, Ivanka will run the China operation, and Eric will watch SpongeBob
Good idea.  The market has a propensity to go up under normal circumstances.  Knowing that we will keep printing money and have a divided government sure helps investors in decisions to add risk.
went balls deep on JKS $75 11/20 calls, retarded? lol
I lost over 40k today, can't really feel anything right now, honestly might go long $ROPE
how the fuck are we green anyways? is literally everything priced in

Back in August I sold SPY 300-360 iron condors expiring on November 20th. Since then 2.5 months passed and only 2 weeks left and the iron condor I sold for $6000 is still worth $5300. It lost zero value today even with VIX dropping 20%. Simply fucking amazing.
2000 election between Bush and Gore was pretty damn close. Bush won 271 electoral votes and Gore won 266 votes.

Bush won Florida by 537 votes and Dems wanted a recount because it was so close and Florida was the difference. But Supreme Court had a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Bush, which stopped the recount.
he has political allies?
let's not count these chickens just yet. there's still potentially days worth of soul-crushing anxiety ahead as absentee and early votes are counted while a putrid kiddie rapist dribbles on about how the election is rigged. meanwhile, the ghoulish puppet masters keeping him in power have _actually_ tried to rig the election through gerrymandering and blatantly unconstitutional attempts to prevent american votes from being counted.

the fact that the race is even this close is distressing. to find out just how many of my fellow americans are shallow, stupid, bootlicking cucks is an utter disappointment.

frankly, my NIO calls are the only thing keeping me sane these days. at this point, my sole remaining hope is that NIO rips into the 4th dimension so i can fuck off to Monaco and leave these mouth-breathing rubes to wallow in their own filth.

its the equities that should not be mooning lol
Because the thought of giving a concession speech gives him strokes. ‚ÄúWe lost the election, it was stolen and rigged, what can you do?‚Äù VS ‚ÄúI lost the election, and now the most important thing to do is heal the divide come together, support our new president Biden and continue to grow this great nation.‚Äù No way he can say the second part.

Markets should not like a Republican Senate because with a Democratic president, the Republicans will do every thing they can to screw up the economy to make biting look bad. Look at what they did in 2009 through 2012.
Sure seems that way.... I said when it hit 28... it will dip, ill get in then. Then it hit 30 and I said, when it dips below 29 I will get in. Then it hits 35 and I say, if it hits 33, ill get in... Now we are at 38.... Fuck me.

No I am not! In fact I am hoping for higher vix. Do you know how many vxx calls I got???? Don't tell sec please
i've got a NIO $25 call for 11/20 thats been creaming.  

Sell the call for a 400% profit?

or exercise and up my NIO holding to around 200 shares?
same with ABBV.  Strong day today.
Funko Pop calls. After this week, you wont see the stock under $10

>The math is very simple now. 

>In addition to his called states, Biden is leading in MI, WI, NV, and AZ. 

>If that doesn‚Äôt change he has 270 electoral votes and wins.

>He doesn‚Äôt need PA or GA. And he doesn‚Äôt need anything more counted.

>Trump is the one who needs more counting.
Yeah but you‚Äôre dumb so who cares
We buying this dip fellas?
ooof someone is getting nervous lol
No one here cares who wins, we care about making money ü§ë, and if you do care you are in the wrong sub
Has Biden locked up all the electoral college votes in Maine?
Don‚Äôt be shy spy, FALL SOME MORE
THE POWER OF DESTRUCTION IS DEVASTATING!
Idk man, but I got like 25 dollars worth of food for 4 bucks last night because of a coupon with uber eats.

Their cost of acquisition must be absurd.
How far
Biden and Trump take a test. Teacher grades 5/10 questions on Trump's test, realizes they're all correct. Grades 5/10 questions on Biden's test, realizes only 3 are correct, finishes grading questions on Biden's test and he gets 5/10 points. Trump 5/5, Biden 5/10, same correct points though. Now Biden's mommy, Hillary, delivers some cookies and asks the teacher to give Biden a +1 extra credit. Biden 6, Trump 5. This is the stupidity at the election this year.
Scalped 25% on NIO calls within 20 minutes this morning. Shits crazy but I don‚Äôt want to catch the drop down. Could also regret hopping out. Gimme a red day on nio this week and I‚Äôll load up I promise

I‚Äôm gonna short the fuck out of the top

Has there been a other presidential election like this ?
Neither.

Trade war with China is one of only few things that I like about Donnie Boy
There still seems to be some lingering thought in foreign policy circles that america can "stop" china somehow. The US is 1/4th of their size, that would be like Great Britain trying to stop America somehow.
do i go balls deep in spy 340p or no?
Lol 

You are not considering the favourable side of Donnie here. Donnie single-handedly pumped this market from that crash to ATH
username checks out
It will go up as Wall Street bet on Biden
I'm not complaining since I bought 200 shares on Monday for 88/share, but anyone know what caused a 9% jump in ABBV?

Best line I‚Äôve read in a article this morning was on Reuter‚Äôs announcing ‚ÄúNevada has stopped counting and will continue on Thursday‚Äù... talk about a work ethic at those ballots.

Shit sorry boss, let me get you an answer on the next leader of the free world some time before the weekend (maybe?)
They got better...
Both are good.

Trump = Trade wars are easy to win

Biden = Ummm maybe we forget about the trade war IDK maybe a compromise?
mail-in ballots still stuck in our recently defunded USPS system

Fucked up and bought hella Tesla @ 426 and saw it crash to 417 LOL but then it came up to 427 and i said fuck it and sold that shit like the paper hands I am. Made some gains somehow
oh shit i really bought the top
*facepalm*

way to evade all the actual data.  ie: math.

ie:  valuation of $25B then becomes $35B but the tether was based on 10/8.

analysts upgraded amd to $120... but then (after the deal) downgraded xlnx to $130. (ie:  not ~200)

the math does not add up.  this is off by such an absurd margin.  far beyond arbitrage.

you also omit amd going from 88 to 74 on the rumour/news, despite their best er in history and 2 other major catalysts.

kick rocks
This is not a good day to have add
The ONLY good advice I‚Äôve ever heard out of him was ‚Äúbuy Nvidia‚Äù
MI, WI, AZ, NV, ME turned Blue. SPY $400. AAPL $150
They can't do that without an amendment which requires too many states to ratify for it to be feasible.
God I hope so
They both succ China cock so doesn't matter
Dude what are you talking about?

Covid was a gift for him. He was in charge, could have let all the "US leading medical expert of the free world" talk, sit back and sell maga masks. But he blew it up because he cant shut up.
Anyone who thinks legitimate mail in ballots is fraud is a sore loser. Trump (likely) lost because of his handling of the pandemic. 

It‚Äôs not voters faults states didn‚Äôt consider a pandemic when making election laws. If they had, probably could have been like Florida where all the results are in the night of because they have been processing and counting millions of mail in ballots since October 12th and not starting the day of the election.

It takes time to open up each individual ballot, inspect it, and tabulate the results through a machine when you have millions of ballots to go through.
ELECTION TALKS GOING WELL
Imagine being worried about tax hikes on people making 400k a year.
Lol hahaha

Nah brah you‚Äôre sus as fuck
TSLA bruv what is you doin?
Jerome out here trying to kill VIX.
It has been stolen. Democrats played a very dirty game for 4 years, i don't trust them to be honest on election day
Feels a little hypocritical to participate in corrupt capitalism while claiming to be a communist but nobody wants to lose money I guess.
How? Trump has been telling his supporters to vote in person for a couple months. Absentee and early voting is democrat by a huge margin.

That's the setup. He's been prepping you to think it's "questionable". Everyone knows this.
Biggest bull trap ever recorded
Another account dead just when i was finally getting closer to break even now i‚Äôm deeper in the red üëç

100k+ is not poor, retard.
I think the big question is, if Biden wins but Trump has two months left in office to potentially destroy everything before he defects to Russia, what will happen to the market before inauguration day?
I think they are. It's just looking like it's not close enough for that to matter.
The majority of this country and the world rejoices. Rich conservatives and poor uneducated whites for the most part has a big sad and life goes on.
Biden isnt gonna be tweeting threats at other countries, and threatening WW3 over twitter

Thats a HUGE win for market, like an unbelievable sigh of relief for the next 4 years if biden wins, youll be able to sleep comfortably with your eyes shut as an investor

Your answer lies in Ancient Greek mythology
Idk man
is this your first election?
Bro I‚Äôm out of it. Spaced the fuck out with this stupid market
\>  Without it huge swaths of the country would be ignored by the executive bc they lack vote density. 

&#x200B;

With the electoral college large swaths of the country are ignored because they aren't swing states.  

&#x200B;

With a popular vote candidates would actually have reason to go to California, Texas, New York, Indiana, states that get no attention otherwise.
majority dems, not 190,000 to 0 dems. sus as fuk.  at least throw in a few trump votes to make it look non-obvious.
So no Trump voters in Detroit.  Gotcha
Ok but who‚Äôs better for China stocks trump or Biden
Clearly you are too stupid to realize that this effects small businesses and not everything is about Wall Street

Nice dip to buy more
Weak volume likely means that it's us retards (aka retail traders) driving up this rally. All the institutional investors are probably on the sidelines, ready to wipe us out soon.
Yep I think you're right, looks like the senate will stay red.

Nothing long term unless it results in slower business growth. News of a tax hike can momentarily cause a panic drop. But the stock market isn‚Äôt the economy.

Bought puts at 346, do I hold?

Lol think again bitch
Yes
Have an exit plan and stick to it.
how dare some stocks on my watch list turn red?
I dig this new uncertainty that we're seeing in the market. If we could keep this up all week I'd be able to get out of some unwise decisions
Trumprards don‚Äôt understand this
the price you see on options on Etrade is not the current bid or ask.  It is the last price.  NEVER buy or sell at market.  And you will be better off.
Those stocks all went up a ton leading up to the election.
If you‚Äôre so smart why didn‚Äôt you just throw that money in a dumpster instead of taking the time to set up that retarded trade
Have you even looked at the 2 people running? They both suck lmao, it‚Äôs clearly the party that is keeping both of them afloat, not the individuals.
So. Real talk, if Biden is confirmed, what do you think will happen?
Some how made money on Dow and Ge puts lol that was retarded
Still missing the point. 1,600 isn't a lot for this sub. You're like Spongebob trying to get into the salty spitoon (WSB) when you should be at Winnie Hut Jr. (r/babystreetbets). People are even losing more money than this on BSB no less
He declared himself the victor and it rallied right away. Market surprisingly holding on to the gains after slight sell off at open. As the results get closer and closer it gives us some stability. Just waiting for orange man to do something deranged if he loses.
if your fds are up 200% then TAKE FUCKING PROFITS.
Never Short Tim Apple.
With an impending Biden win, this is the largest short squeeze you'll see in a while
Winnings will be taxed more but we will all never get to know that because of losing so hard.
Holy shit bears were so happy this morning pre market after ü•≠ speech, I would say I feel bad but they are the biggest pieces of shits so I dont

HOLY SHIT!  Now's My Chance!

I've tried posting this at least 3 times to this degenerate Sub, but it keeps getting banned for being too political.  But the time has come, Mods!  Stand back and stand by.

Ladies and Gentlemen,  Autists of all ages,  I present to you:

**Tesla‚Äôs 5 year plan, from a Retarded Elon Musk Fanboy.  Lets begin.**

Late 2020: Trump wins re-election.  Stock Market surges with Airlines leading the way.  They take the Trump Victory as a green light and attempt to jumpstart travel again with a big ad campaign highlighting fleets of brand new planes (which they bought with their Corona Bailout money, never forget they were first in line for government handouts).

2021: Planes fall out of the sky.  After a sudden surge in airline crashes,  it's revealed that those brand new planes were actually the 737 MAX's. Investigation reveals Boeing did the bare minimum repairs. Internal Memos say something like ‚ÄúFAA are all boomers, COVID will get them‚Äù. New CEO retires in disgrace. The Boeing controversy serves as a distraction from Starlink which is well into beta testing.

2022: Successful launch of SpaceX 's Startship redoubles anti Boeing sentiment. President Trump, ecstatic to flex that he "makes the best deals", makes an example of SLS. Since it's literally 2nd grade math, even Trump is able to clearly explain that paying someone "whatever the project costs + 10%" mathematically incentivizes them to let costs overrun. The public crucifies Boeing. Cable News runs headlines "Should Cost Plus Contracts be Illegal". The issue is heavily politicized.  Democrats somehow convince everyone it's all Trump's fault while he spends the bulk of the year pushing new legislation surrounding government contracts. Boeing Stock tanks. Starlink goes live without anyone noticing.

2023: Using knowledge gained from Starship and advancements in Battery Technology, Elon Musk announces plan for the Tesla Model 7. A joint venture between SpaceX and Tesla to make the first electric passenger plane. Congress is lobbied to make up laws as to why electric planes are not allowed. The SEC is instructed to go after Musk citing ‚Äúsomething about merging SpaceX and Tesla resources is wrong‚Äù. CNBC spearheads media smear campaign against E-planes. Citing the Samsung Galaxy, the phrase "Batteries Explode on Planes" is said a lot. Jim Cramer still thinks Boeing is a buy calling it something like ‚ÄúThe S&P‚Äôs sweetheart‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Ultimate American Stock‚Äù. Musk moves forward anyway, spends back end of the year tweeting furiously about Fake News and Corrupt Government. Trump and Elon retweet each other regularly. Starlink gains popularity and is now live globally.

2024: Verizon has a massive earnings miss due to an unexpected wave of Cellular data cancelations. The popping sound of heads coming out of the sand is heard round the world as Governments across the globe realize that Starlink makes 5G unnecessary and Elon has become the most important figure in communications (and by extension, information/spycraft) overnight. This on top of the budding Trump Musk Twitter bromance pisses off the wrong people.  Elon is called before a congressional hearing akin to the Zuckerberg hearings of 2018 and big tech hearing of 2020. SpaceX and Tesla both live-stream the hearings. All of the congressmen sitting on the panel are in either Boeing or Verizon's pocket and it shows. The hearings get personal when they try to make Elon Musk the patsy for tech companies having too much power. Musk points to companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter who are currently using their full power to influence the 2024 election openly.  Musk recreates the actual moment from Iron Man 2, storming out of the hearing early to thunderous applause. The moment goes viral. Youtube and Twitter ban it, probably because Elon uses a trendy slang phrase on his way out and big tech deems it hate speech. Starship launches shortly thereafter sending people to Mars for the first time. Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter account goes on a well deserved rampage with President Trump retweeting nearly all of it. Twitter bans Elon Musk and makes Trump take down any retweets of Musk. Elon responds by launching his own version of Twitter practically overnight, with President Trump as the first new user. The new Twitter is loved by all except the far left as it is literally just twitter with better algorithms and less speech policing. Elon backs the GOP Ticket who wins in a landslide due to Dems still thinking OG Twitter is a good gauge of public sentiment and also because It's Ivanka Trump and Tulsi Gabbard.  Ivanka vows to split Youtube and Google in her first 100 days.

2025: A Model 7 Prototype is successfully tested. Preorders from airlines smash records. Elon founds a new airline that will use only electric planes. No one even tries to stop him as $TSLA stock is now a staple in the SP500. The price is well over 1 thousand, and Musk considers splitting it again. SLS is cancelled as SpaceX sets up the Ole Reliable Program: a program where SpaceX preserves the latest successful iteration of Starship for government use while simultaneously continuing to innovate at breakneck speeds.

Trump:  "Guh"

>How come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?
Biden is that awful. As was Hillary. Damnit why can't the Dems put out a decent candidate.
Cant believe how many times iv'e missed the boat on NIO. I was playing it when it was at $5
Lol
Market is legit delusional here

Biden os bringing Elizabeth Warren, Sanders in his administration

Harris is his VP

Reps gonna play hard ball in Senate now given they don't have a president and they need to prep for 2022 by sticking to conservative policy 

I am going to buy December Puts. And wait for November to be over to make a decision.
Sold naked puts on this which was freeeeeeeee money.
Can we just touch 340 again by eod i promise to sell all my puts and buy calls
Daddy Biden will be giving us a nice dip to buy all our leaps for
Le voter manipulation cries
Probably because the world is losing confidence in the dollar lmao

Without the Senate turning blue, it'll probably be a few years before he can even put a tax plan on the table.
Here goes Kudlow. Lmfaoooo.
So, why am I losing money on Baba calls if I bought it at $186 yesterday and now it‚Äôs $191. They‚Äôre weeklies btw.
Calls on UBER forever!!! üòçüòçüòç
I was wondering why my JD calls were going nuclear this morning. Guess I'll keep riding, but man I jumped a bit.
Evidence it was a fair price: Both companies had teams of M&A specialists, accountants, and boards of directors pouring over the details and eventually reached an agreement at that specific ratio.

Evidence it was an unfair price: /u/robmafia says it's obvious.
Probably are waiting for full results before releasing. Opening and tabulating millions of mail in ballots takes time.
Don‚Äôt trust IOT fridge with your RH info, might as well be raw dogging the internet.

Apparently poor people love ü•≠
Nobody talk about üöÄ, it always tanks when we talk about üöÄ.
So what happens now that the election is over? Does the market usually pump until new year or go flat? Drop?
Except it depends on volunteers to run. And for some reason these states didn't allow the volunteers to stay counting mail in ballots until polls closed. So after 12 hours of volunteer work, they were handed crates of mail in ballots.
I think you're retarded for missing obv sarcasm.
If people got weeks to mail in a ballot with help from community leaders, why did people only get one day of in person voting when there was so much more of that.
sorry guys just bought some stonks.

this must be the top
probably get some methylated spirits and afford a pretty good bum fight out of it, even have change for KFC on the way home
Yep me also.   Who knew. Three days up in a row redic
Clearly you are to stupid to realize more taxes doesn‚Äôt actually effect Wall Street. It‚Äôs just a squeeze on the middle class. Wall Street has money to restructure and adapt to the tax code. It‚Äôs why Apple Pay‚Äôs 4% I‚Äôm tax and you pay 18+%. Only thing Biden will do is squeeze the middle class and Wall Street will not go to 6-8%
up
Dow slipping.  .nasdaq soon
Whenever I touch dkng I get fucked
Probably face rips after Nevada is called for Biden
Any calls I should focus on buying right now??? Or it‚Äôs too late
Im so smooth brained I bought monday lol
You sold your position or exercised it?
Not sure, just saw it on cnbc
Why?

None of my calls for NIO went through lmao 
Not even at above ask price

So for a Trump victory now, he needs to hold what he has and flip either Michigan, Wisconsin, or Nevada. Imo not gonna happen.

Once you stop buying puts the MM sense a shift in gamma and the rug pull shall commence.

Not when you see what districts were counted

If you like tinfoil hats, Biden voters voted by Mail,  trumpers by person which is why the in person votes we overwhelmingly trump then when Mail in ballots were counted over night they were overwhelmingly Biden. Only takes like half an IQ to understand.
Why? They counted mail in votes which are majority Dems
Weekly spy puts
This isn‚Äôt right, like what in the actual fu** is this???
What price / date
Yeah, a recount means shit if he loses multiple states. Especially with machines doing the counting.
Your DD is on point.

The fact of the matter is that Jack Ma is an overconfident idiot that got lucky to be in a system where they were just trying to pump growth. He doesn't really understand what it would be like to compete in a real market like the US.

That said, biting the hand that feeds you isn't a great strategy when all of your food is locked behind a cage that Xi holds the key to.

Without a change in China leadership, Jack Ma is either going to be disappeared or Baba is going to be acquired by Tencent for pennies on the dollar.

Whoever said that [Alibaba Intelligence](https://youtu.be/aHGd6LqAVzw) is a thing is retarded.

Even Elon understands where his bread is buttered.
Do people know about limit orders? Jesus

Can someone tell me why I just bought QQQ calls when it‚Äôs already up 4.5%?
Monday is when lol.
It‚Äôs very strange that the market is rallying, but Biden stocks are all being beaten down. Weed and solar are looking horrible
if Biden wins and he hikes up tax rates, what will happen to the stock market?
So legit this is the best outcome right for the markets senate republicans and Biden
Shimano, not cheap though
my NIO calls printing rn **üò©**
It‚Äôs not sus, Trump has been laying the groundwork for this story for months. Every state laid out how long it would take them to count all the ballots ahead of time and none of them have deviated from that.
EOD today?
Trump will still win
Let‚Äôs go Jeff Amazon
Biden presidency with republican senate is bullish! Interesting times
Why tf are they doing that? It's 730AM West Coast
Becky's bike seems to be going uphill at a reasonable pace for once
Well sucks for you. I bought today at the high for a hedge
Cmonnnnn APHA I BEREEEVEEE IN YOUUUUUUU
OH FUCK I FORGOT THE MARKET OPENED
Maybe my AMD calls finally go up to green again after being at -65% recently!
Kept a few 11/20 puts other than that all in QQQ calls are open
The US is literally on the verge of civil strife but spy is up 10 bucks, bull gang always wins! better luck next time bears.
You do realize they‚Äôre counting mail in and that leans heavily towards Biden lol
All the welfare states are blue. Do you want your ex gf to have four kids and just let the state pay for it while you collect food stamps and ignore phone calls from child support? Come to California.
Some states are but not giving anymore updates and will just post the tally after all the counting has been done
Damn, guess I gotta lose 100% and start over
This time I perfectly switched to calls last Friday. So happy about it
Markets gonna fly without donnie holding it hostage
honestly she seems nice, kinda good match for Elon
I lost 27% of my portfolio yesterday and I'm drunk right now. Yup
Wait I get to buy calls under a President that doesn‚Äôt shit talk trade partners on Twitter??
I went to bad after orange mans speech and futures were blood fucking red

Not complaining but what happened?

I go out of the money cause they're cheaper and you still have a lot of security and holding power. Looking at options table a pretty good one would be the May 50C for about 700$ . If you can't afford those go with the February 50C or even January 50C

Can anyone tell me why the price for an option when i check out is always about 20% percent more expensive than what is on the chart? I'm using E-Trade. 

And the price on the chart isn't changing that fast. 

Like a NIO call was $1.00 but at checkout it was like $1.20 * 100= $120

And then after buying my portfolio instantly shows a loss of 20 percent.
It is what it is.
Holding VXX and 11/13 calls here. FOMO money getting gobbled up by the big boys before eow
Nah
Today is just a meme troll of the market mooning after trump's defeat. Puts the rest of the way.
Everything was already predetermined once a ton of the street shorted or bought puts to hedge.
2.5k, was about 7k position when it started
fuck you don‚Äôt think about that just be happy it‚Äôs green today
NIO to 100 by EOY
No one wants to play with TSLA anymore apparently
Double top is in. Let's crash this shit

I dont have the heart to. Trying to decide if it‚Äôs worth it to hold my 11/20s if they‚Äôll come back. Sigh
I don‚Äôt underhand this market. Any help?
You're late to the party this week. If you see green, sell, and do more research.
You'll thank me later.

holy shit, i was perfectly comfortable holding through a 15% loss, but now that i‚Äôm finally 2% in the profits, i cant hold onto that shit and sell out. now it‚Äôs up another 3%, fml
So if Biden wins will trump asking for a recount do anything? I mean don‚Äôt do most mail in ballots favor dems and it‚Äôll just mean he loses by a bigger margin?
Unhealthily retarded
Bitch u be thinking too hard. 
This stock, just like tesla, have enough buzz around them and again, volume and volatility.

Yeah, if üò¥ wins but Mitch the Bitch still holds the Senate I have no idea how a stimmy gets through
They had trump - 700 last night. WSB was going full trumpeteer mode lol.
Mitch won't want to help with that. 2008 repeat.
98% of clients who are short on this market are fucking dead
We're not getting any Nevada updates till tomorrow
>I'd like to think this is more circumstantial than anything else.

The thing is, the intervention doesnt make much sense, its useless and pointless

The only reason they did it was to signal the market that they are watching closely and thats the important piece, that we were getting very close to the real deal interventions

As is stands now, the markets "floor" appears to be 3200, thats when the fed gets jittery, so you are looking at about 5% downside vs unlimited upside, its a pretty damn good buy at this stage for stocks
Are we selling the bounce?
Lol I‚Äôm up $800 on the day. Fucking nuts.

Holy shit I took profit on my 11/13 40c NIO a bit too early. Its okay though, I still have several other calls. I never expected it to go up this fast though. Jesus fuck.
Maybe anticipated stability is what is driving it up.. or just fomo?
Hope you kept the receipt.
I disagree. Everyone is polarized to the party
2.4k.... i wish it was only $100
No way this is sustainable. You guys think MM going to let all those calls print EOW? Fuck no. This is the biggest bull trap dead cat of the year. MM about to take all that FOMO sideline money and pocket it

Because it‚Äôs a big ass country with multiple time zones and frankly paper ballots work fine. There is really no economic reasons to spends billions and billions to build a centralized system that only gets used for a few years and dismantled for being inefficient and obsolete in a few years.

Tsla so gay
CNBC: "*Kanye says "we will be going to the Supreme Court.""*
Vote this guy 2024
I wonder if the market is going up because even though Biden might win, having a republican senate will be a sort of stop gap from the dems messing with the market (higher corporate taxes, etc). Market likes stability
DKNG gonna moon.  3 more states legalized. TN just allowed it, plus 2 more already slated to allow gambling.  They're going to revise forward guidance, for the upcoming ER very soon, based on the elections results.  Very bullish guidance means rockets for DKNG.  Buy the dip. It is still down.

I'm not sure if AOC would be a good/bad Presidential candidate but you 100% know when she declares she is going to run away with the DNC nomination. Just wondering when that will be and who she will be up against.
2500% returns in the year would be nuts. The fuckers holding leaps I envy
What are some good positions on NIO leaps?
I know the news stations are not trying to call anything but they all know it's over. Who is going to be the big dick station to call it first
I should probably just take the L on my NIO put
I wonder if I should sell my calls I‚Äôm up 200% on

Markets are up because rep senate and Dem pres means nothing changes and we see stability.
You've got to admit that it's pretty fucking sus that they decided to just... stop counting *right* before it was a clear landslide and now that the next day dawns the situation is magically reversed. 

I love how everyone was bitching about how Trump was trying to stop counting, but now that it's obvious that the halt *somehow* favored Biden it's aaaaaall fine.

No stimulus...?
Everything on my screen is green holy shit
NIO expanding to Europe next year, China Government is backing this up financially and with subsidies/incentives.  NIO is only an EV company, but they have a lot of growth potential.  Is TSLA is valued at 400B, currently NIO is a 10th of that.  They can grow a lot more and possibly reach the TSLA market cap.

EDIT: Also think that NIO will license out the NIO battery swapping tech to EVs.

He made that speech to set up for legal fights and to claim the election was stolen when it doesn‚Äôt go his way. That way he doesn‚Äôt have to make a concession speech we‚Äôre he has to say ‚Äúwe lost, I lost‚Äù. Now we need to come together and focus a on our future and support the new president Biden. He can‚Äôt do that as his ego can‚Äôt handle it.
he suggested he was doing that at one of his rallys, probably to look like a gag but he was probably speaking the truth. I'd like to see the mental gymnastics his supporters will use to validate this move
Then implement the same policies with "it'll be different this time!"
TSLA things
Apple Tech House
My consensus is Mango supporters on Twitter are eating up his claims about fraud, so we should have riots Thursday/Friday
It all comes down to MI imo

Just look at the votes and what votes remain, tough for Trump to win with majority of remaining votes everywhere being mail-in (blue).

they dont care, they just wanted to be stimulated into the ground
Mitch McConnell winning is all that mattered
Definitely wrong lmao

Contest election and circuit breaker by close
TBH I didn't expect it to be remotely this close this election. If it can be this close with Trump on the ballot imagine if the Republicans next candidate is someone that isn't a complete lunatic?
Sell, people, I'm begging you

there's some of you who think the market can't possibly be going up on the assumption that biden is going to win and so you're buying puts. your trump-loving ass is going to lose a lot of money today and i'm here for it. keep it up!

Think it's just the love being spread around as the Dow is pumped by Biden win prospects.

It was interesting last night to see the Dow futures down or flat when it looked like Trump but Nasdaq rocket, and then the activity this morning.

If we could explain it we'd be billionaires.

You fucking weeb. 

...

Im in.
The money printer went brrrrr for a long time now and is still brrring, explain to me how the market is irrational when $$ is everywhere?
That has nothing to do with this. If this puts him off gambling (options trading) then it saves him a ton of money in the long run. Nothing you said contests that yet you said it anyway like you're adding something to the conversation.
people are still holding their VXX calls from yesterday


u won‚Äôt get a better entry than here for when mango goes off

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
My 11/06 $125 calls will actually end up printing?
 It really sure why this would make FB jump 7.5% but what do I know
Yup. This. Stimmy gonna suck though
Mail ins
hows that worse ? 
Nothing gets done = status quo (tax cuts)continues  . 
No way biden will touch Jpow = printing continues .
If you are a pussy
Imagine being so retarded that you thought we were saying that you shouldn't buy the dip. We were saying that you should not go all in. Congrats and fuck you

What exactly is a scalp by definition ?
RIDE did this same thing yesterday, ran all day till up 20-30%
Kinda feel bad for mango supporters, like they bought all that trump merchandise and he only made it 4 years, rip
Hindsight.

Who the hell actually expected this to happen. This election is playing out to be a shit-show yet, market is legit parabolic.

But even still I'm freaking pissed I held on Friday and didn't buy thinking we're coming into this week.
Bears are all in $ROPE right now shit is up 100%
Leaders from both companies got together and looked at the valuation of their firms, agreed on a metric, and applied that metric to arrive at the 1:1.72 ratio. Explained.

I, for one, welcome our new tech overlords.
It isn't. The biggest trend is that the centrist liberal world narrative is starting to fail, and that there is a vacuum of story for people to believe in, so anyone who can tell a story can win.

Never
UVXY and VXX recovery about to be unreal
Literally up 2 monthly paychecks in a day xdddddd
The problem with that style is that parties form coalitions against each other that usually end up being the same, dualist "us vs. them" mentality and doesn't help anyone. It also allows for the rise of less desirable types of parties like those of fascists, which would be scary given the recent apparent rise in white nationalism in the US.
Red Senate
Not sure why everybody is so excited about stimmy and market is mooning. Red guys will hold onto Senate. So, Mitch is still in play
that's why they put the fence up.
He didn‚Äôt kill anybody lol China is the culprit and joe Biden is in China‚Äôs pocket along with his son hunter

You need to step out of the propaganda bubble man. You've been fed bullshit for i dunno how long.

And yeah Biden won with high certainty if you actually look at the data - regardless of what other news you read spilling over with propaganda. Perhaps you re-evaluate what's real and what isn't after all this.
This is actually so danm retarded. Didn't know I was going to wake up to losing another account FUCK.
The 17th. At this pace shit could hit 50. 40 is priced in for sure

How does limit up work? Does the whole NASDAQ get halted if it reaches +5%?
Jacked to the tits on weekly and January puts.
there was a surgeon who lived next to me, he was a brain surgeon. but really dumb

even after all that education, one day at the hospital he went into the breakroom and start snacking on peoples lunch they put in the fridge. people would later recognize like hey.....i had turkey on this sandwich where is it?

well he got caught sneaking a slice of cheese off someones sandwich in the fridge, so not only is that theft, but its a health code violation and him being a doctor its big. you can't tamper with others food. he doesn't have a license to handle food. its a hospital, no gloves on.

the health implications of said act along with the theft causing him to lose his license in medicine even after all that education, he decided to protest it, so he went on facebook and posted the follow : "the cheese was bland anyway" that's a direct quote

as if that wasn't a terrible enough excuse, his own mother in the comment section left a reply, it was simply "quit stealing peoples food you dumb \*\*\*\*a"

all quite true, his life seems to have fallen apart recently just for being a dumb person
NASDAQ +4% as a everyone knows that electing a 70+ year old is bullish for technology stonks

I think the market priced in a biden win lol
senate gonna be republican , house dem , prez dem . Basically a lock and nothing really gets done and status quo continues. 
Whats not to like ?
Biden will probably sign some bs related to immigration and stuff but the tax cuts will stay in place.
Markets seem to like Biden winning..
is no one scared of the biden win?
[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20201030a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20201030a.htm)

its a weak intervention, it was more of a signal to the market that they were watching and getting ready, which was enough to pump markets this much i guess
MMs known Trump will win
Change your name to DoubleGay
can we reach ATH today?
I honestly wonder just how much elections ride on abortion views. IMHO it seems like the pro-life lobby is single-handedly keeping the Republican Party relevant.

Buy the CGC dip!
350 0dte lmao can't believe they have a chance. Doubt it'll get there tho
For example, McDonalds has an app, therefore fry cooks are contractors? I don't think that would stand up. Uber/Lyft are just a marketplace to connect drivers to passengers. Does Uber force these drivers to drive at their predetermined shifts, or do they drive when they want to?

I think McDonalds would need their cooks to have the ingredients in their house using their own stove for their own time for this to work. The exact legal requirements are out there for what circumstances make you an employee vs. contractor. It is incredibly clear that Uber's drivers are contractors, and there is no way McDonalds or any other company with an app could pull that off without majorly restructuring their business.
Even in red counties, have absentee ballots favored Trump?
[deleted]
I'm actually the luckiest person alive, I bought in SQQQ  yesterday but then sold shortly after because I had a bad feeling
doesnt matter. if it goes to the supreme court, its filled with pro-constitution judges that will never throw out votes.

they tried that shit once in TX already and got laughed out
If Biden wins, will Trump escape to a different country? Whether you like him or not, you have to admit he's going to be spending a lot of time in court as a defendant.
does anyone know of any stock (NIO like) thats low now and will get a 300% next year? i missed the NIO train ahaha
i might have to start sucking dick for money
He's not with us anymore. He sold the money and now lives in a Telsa.
Trump pity party. Show some dignity man! Trump: ‚ÄúHow come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?‚Äù

People say they regret being cash gang after this gap up but I‚Äôm like, damn I‚Äôm relieved. There were some right moves for sure, but considering yesterday‚Äôs conditions at market close, I would have made more wrong than right moves.
If Biden is favored then why is ICLN down
Id honestly keep it through earnings. Worst case you prolly lose 50 to 60% of the value over the next 2 weeks.

Lol Bears üêª in bambles
Forrest Gump meme: and just like that, the recession was off.

Only thing i regret is being so impoverished from the last six months that i couldn't buy calls on everything and that i bought the dip too soon.

I wanted to buy NIO calls and Vix puts but decided to stick with RKT and HYLN. It's gone well but still got some fomo.
Alibaba is letting me down so much smh
I opened a bunch of bear call spreads yesterday on SPY (348/349) because I thought that with a contended election, there was no way that we would pump $12 on SPY. WTF is even happening? We get a cure to the Rona?
Prob just a short squeeze
This is a wildly optimistic and highly unlikely liberal take

I'm so glad I talked myself out of SPY puts... market has retard strength today.
I've been trying to stay away from letting any and all news affect my trading.  I let it change me today, I should have traded much bigger today.

This is the final nail in the coffin.  I will only focus on the actual market.

Make China great again!
I just don‚Äôt get how his tax policies aren‚Äôt being priced in. They definitely seem negative for the market. But I guess the market doesn‚Äôt care right now since that won‚Äôt happen for awhile and a bigger stimulus will supposedly come with him soon.
Right now I think it's going to come down to urban voters in Philly and Detroit (61% and 70% reporting so far respectively). That will lean both Penn and Mich to Biden.
[deleted]
you were saying...
Trump has no chill on twitter
Markets just priced in world peace.. gains for everyone!!!
Down -99% AT. I had tech calls on Monday too and switched to puts. Sucks not making money on days like this. I swear if I had calls, we would‚Äôve hit a circuit breaker.

Oh well. GG. I‚Äôm out.
No I doubled down on 339p for 11/18
JFC David Hunter has been right this whole time lol
The older part of gen z carried the election we couldn‚Äôt take this shit 4 more years
We crashed like 15% from ATH and everyone‚Äôs surprised we are correcting up?
Not necessarily a negative, but a risk, is that Chinese companies can turn and fuck you quick. Either through scandals or government intervention

NC is likely trump (but not 100%); GA is actually leaning Biden (Atlanta suburbs have a lot of votes left); PA is a toss up/leaning Biden (1.4 M absentee ballots still to count)
You must be a cunt
WSB logic: market goes up 3%, time to buy calls.  Market goes down 3%, time to buy puts.

Everything for the most part is green on my watchlist...imo who ever wins the market will go up short term. Market will drop towards beginning of term if Biden does win. If Trump wins it‚Äôll drop towards end of term.

The main thing that needs to change, regardless of policy, is the attitude the American people have with these elections. That by winning they‚Äôll vanquish the other side and that their viewpoints should be steamrolled. That doesn‚Äôt happen. 49% of the population doesn‚Äôt just go away or tuck tail and admit defeat. We‚Äôre stuck in a self destructive antagonistic style. We need real leadership that unites people. Hopefully we get that in 2024.
Read your original post, you schmuck.  Talking about feelings he literally flipped your words and you acted like a snowflake.
Trumps most recent tweet is hilarious. Sounds like a child and a science fiction author at the same time

What.. the... fuck.. Tesla.. you retarded mf company do something. I can‚Äôt wait to get this piece of shit out of my portfolio. This not a real company. Just a pump and dump that‚Äôs over now. GOOG is the real deal. Elon Musk is a con artist
That was such an obvious play with prop 22 surely passing in ca. Why didn't I think of this. Glad someone made a few bucks. I'd sell it today.
Did I hear CNBC say the Trump campaign is going to address the media shortly?

Told you guys to buy BIIB
Yea last week..
That Trump tweet felt like a concession tweet
I feel absolute disgusting. It is way too easy making money putting $10K bets down on momentum moves on SPY right now with 0-2/3 DTE.  I've cleared almost $25K this week on mindless bullshit gambling.  I'm afraid of how easy this is, and the risk for addiction.  This is crazy.
He‚Äôs jerking off on 100 dollar bills
I think cannabis is the safest and easiest money out here now. Look at the long term charts, every ticker has room for explosive growth with sentiment, the sector has been beat down to shit. 4 states just legalized, and if Biden sweeps it's really on. 
This and Nio

Yeah I'm mad
So hang on, who won? I am reading conflicting information.
If someone looked at me with a straight face yesterday and said spy 350 was on the table for today, I would have laughed and promised I'd eat my shoe if that happened.
at the end of the day its the fed and their "unlimited QE"

you just cant win against infinite money printing

What is the market seeing to be going up this much? The election is going to be contested, COVID is still raging, China trade war isn't resolved, No stimmy any time soon, and tons of uncertainty. 

There's literally nothing to be bullish about right now. It's like if you make all the "wrong" plays that make no sense, the market will reward you. Truly retarded, never seen anything like this and I've been in the market for nearly a decade.

Lots of dem voters are unfortunately bitchmade, but a solid 90% of republican voters are retarded
Even Steven
obvious prediction: as absentee votes continue to be counted Biden will likely win. DJT already has been laying the groundwork of "fraud" for months- there is no way he will accept the results. 

&#x200B;

His minions like OANN and Tomi Lahren etc already tweeting about how he won and all of these absentee votes being counted are fraud etc.

It will probably get ugly...

It fills my soul with anger to look at the TQQQ chart and remember how many shares of it that I sold in 2012...
So I guess if I'm crafting a bullish narrative, Biden+GOP senate is just a repeat of 2012-2016, which was very good for the markets? No meaningful change, so the big corps just keep feasting, doesnt matter if normal people get stimulus
Most likely he doesn't win any of them, only mail in's left and those have been mostly Biden

bro isn't she like 17?
Its still not over? Whats going on? Just woke up
I went to bed 5 hours ago and I fully expected Georgia to be called for Biden while I was asleep, didn't expect the sudden Michigan/Wisconsin surge thought it'd be a trickle.
sold early and then it moons. supposedly this is the side money waiting to buy after the election, but the count isnt even over and its highly likely to be contested. Lots of volume only 50 minutes in

You know representative democracies, where we vote for representatives (i.e. senators and congresspersons), is also a form of democracy right?

Voters unilaterally deciding laws is described as direct democracy.

Contrary to this very commonly-used talking point, democracy is not a singular type of gov‚Äôt, it is a family of similar, related gov‚Äôts, all of which utilize voting in some fashion.

This much money pumping into the markets would signal that traders think the worst case scenario has passed. A drawn out, boring election reduces the chance of civil unrest. Everyone who de-risked in October is now seeing the cities aren't on fire, and putting their money back in

**ACB bagholders where you at? I tried to tell you. I tried! Check my comments, literally said 3-4 times in big comments that it was shit. Shoulda listened you fomo clowns. Portfolio is up 26% today on Z, FB and TQQQ calls. SMD and stop dickriding everyones overbought bandwagon positions.**

So was Jimmy Carter.
I‚Äôve come up with a winning strategy. I come here and ask you incels what you think of a specific ticker. You tell me it‚Äôs gonna dump, I buy.. I make money. You tell me to buy, I stay away... I save hella money. Fuck y‚Äôall.

it's best possible outcome for stonks going up, the senate won't let biden do crazy tax plans, and the white house will be less of a mess
Spy puts r ded
I did but I bought them for cheaper later that day.
Judging by mangos tweets Biden will. They‚Äôre getting scared
No
Flair not checking out for that one.
Theoretically if Biden holds his lead in NV, AZ, WI, ME and MI he gets the magic 270
Xpev up another 9% today
scalped 2.7k from 0DTE spy calls LOL

I can't figure out why VXX has such massive sell volume either. It's not like we know much more than we did yesterday, other than the fact that the elections took place.
Moved hard through 1725 resistance. Good sign.
Any value ETFs with decent option volume?
Less than a week ago half the sub loaded up on spy 320s lol

Go back to wolf of Wall Street to that Matthew scene. Holds true especially now. No one knows shit
Lesson of the day. Don't be gay!
I will not sell my spy puts! i'd rather them go worthless than being a cuck. Its gonna crash
Sold my calls for a decent profit, this shit will go down soon and I‚Äôll jump back in again.
post proof
Or actual traders realized the market reflects future predictions and certain political results may actually indicate stability and sustained growth. Lots of articles have been published analyzing a joe victory effect on the market, the consensus being ‚Äúnot as bad as we thought it could be‚Äù

I was told there would be a dump
Christian Bible
The Old Testament "condemns the practice of charging interest on a poor person because a loan should be an act of compassion and taking care of one's neighbor"; it teaches that "making a profit off a loan from a poor person is exploiting that person. (Exodus 22:25‚Äì27)".
KNDI üëÄ anyone know why it‚Äôs mooning???
Insanity
üêª r fuk . simple
This FB pump is senseless! This doesn‚Äôt make any sense üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§
Sandra Smith is put together real nice.
To the moon!
My entire portfolio is down 50% today. 

Holy fuck
Yup
Senate not democratic
So why do you think tech stocks are jumping up?
Vote is in, gambling is legalized, true winner DKNG
That's good, right?
Where is the fucking dump? I was told SPY 220 in december
You never know when the stock will go up, it's a lot easier to lose all the money in the contract than lose the whole shares. Now you look at it yea if I bought calls from the start I would make more money, but if nio didn't go up, i would lose a lot more money too. I never thought nio would be $30 this fast.
You‚Äôre out of tendies, reload my boy. Proof btw.
Oof trump getting crushed by IV
So this was the worst election outcome, contentious election, mango going rogue, and market is still going up. Somebody explain that to me.
biden = stability = market like
Just made $60 trading JPM calls on the toilet. God Bless America!
Well looks like Biden did win - and I made a ton of money. Worked out quite well!
Government gridlock is a feature, not a bug.
Never hold through earnings. Haven‚Äôt you learned anything on this sub my guy? Even if it‚Äôs a big beat you‚Äôll get clapped.
We did it boys we're only down 80% all time now.
SPY is the new president
Went from 1400 to fucking 352 in 4 days trying to time a spy drop that barely happened.

People actually thought this was the crash lmao. Guys until the debt bubble bursts the stock market is fine jesus.

someone please explain what is going on?
Still bullish, amazing dip to buy on
I needed 1 week for spy to just not go fucking parabolic. 1 fucking week.
Vix dying hard lol bull run confirmed
Why dont we just have a election every day so we have unlimited tendies
All you fuckers made fun of my DD, SMD
You're a retard huh
The mango man
Lol... no. 45\* was ushered in by America's reaction to Obama. It is one of the very few things Mango says that I 100% agree with.
Fine analysis.
What are the odds that it comes down to a state worth 6 points. This whole thing is bull shit.
Conservatives don't riot. They just don't believe in science, which has resulted in far more deaths currently (through COVID) and probably many more in the future, due to their global warming denials. I'll rather deal with damage to a few properties than rampant deaths from science denial.
Yeah makes no sense

Is it the same guy who was on MSNBC last night with a bottle of $2,000+ Pappy van Winkle in the back?
My system got me into TQQQ (long) yesterday EOD. Staying in till it tells me to pull it out. Retards to win in this game you just need to survive long enough. Ohh and I posted here a couple days ago about my terrible back pain, and a bunch of people were actually sympathetic and suggested that my bed was too soft. I slept on the floor for a couple nights and then removed a mattress topper I had, and it's getting much much better. Thanks WSB

Bruh, this was about as obvious as can be. This playbook was about as known as the New Testament. Red wave as the early vote and election votes were counted. Mail-in ballots would be in Biden‚Äôs favor. 

He‚Äôs about to lose Georgia, run by a shady Republican. How does he explain that one? A Dem hoax? Give me a fucking break. That‚Äôs a dude with nothing left in the tank. Low energy.

Not while the election is still contested.  The market doesn't want to be the reason their candidate loses.
Massive stimmy hype, saved the economy in 2008
Trump was at -800 last night. That was hilarious.
11/4 is the way.
Hmm. I'm still not getting it.

> and yes, it's a net negative WHEN YOU OVERPAY

Not saying you're wrong, but doesn't AMD's leadership know better what an appropriate price to pay is for a merger than you, an outsider? What did they miss that you didn't?
All in on INOVIO
I can't tell if this is a real tweet or not, which is kind of sad.

How‚Äôs my day going?

Saw CAT -1% (big holding) and TSLA @ $337 premarket and went back to sleep.

Woke up and saw CAT tank, and TSLA tank. 

So I was able to see and expect CAT to be fucked, and then I got a small amount of hope from TSLA before it fucked me too.

Wake up a millionaire and covid gone. Yes please
I didn't consider what Trump will do with a loss. Like does he just take his hands off the wheel so he doesn't hand a surging economy over to Biden? Can't see him fighting too hard for America knowing he's fired.

MI, WI, AZ, NV means Biden wins
Check out how much each state contributes in tax dollars and how much of the federal budget they get. Rural red states take more than they contribute and vice versa.
Congrats whoever bought the morning dip

Just a reminder: If you lost money on short term derivatives or hedge instruments this week, don't kick yourself. Literally no one could predict the volatility and price movement on this election. This is, for once, not your fault. Stay positive my brothers.

Trump on Twitter: ‚ÄúLast night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the ‚Äúpollsters‚Äù got it completely & historically wrong!‚Äù
Love this IV crush
I am long now
buying the dip on NIO is the new buying the dip on TSLA.  Can't go tits up.
I started playing with Stocks / Options in April after reading some Wallstreetbets.  I started with small money.. $1,000.  My goal was to double the amount.  I stared with buying JNUG (meme stock) and sold after about two weeks, then I made some short term trades with APPL and BABA calls. After that I bought some calls for BAC and SBUX.  I doubled my money within a month and half.  I think I cashed out with a gain of about $1.5K in June (right before I got the corona virus).  

My brother, on the other hand, started playing a week after I did.  He threw a grand into JNUG with some bad timing.  Held it for over a month,  broke even, and then threw $5K into stocks (out of frustration) and let them sit for three months.   He made about 2K and cashed out.

Funny bit:  My brother cashed out his JNUG a day before their stock consolidation, by coincidence.  He checked the stock the next day and completely flipped out, thinking he missed a 1000% stock increase by a day.
by not watching fox news
Natural gas is outrageously cheap - the economics won't be there for solar outside of a handful of states for a good long while.
Tax cuts will likely stay because the senate is still republican.
Yes, the political party that promotes spacial distancing are the voters that sent their ballots in by mail.  Trump would obviously have more in person turn out but the mail in ballots will keep coming in and will mostly be in Joe's favor.
Just yolod my whole account on nio....gg

I'm down a shit load on sunrun. I think it works like earnings. Theres a run up and if its good theres an explosion followed by a gradual sell off. But here its a run off followed by stocks doing "?"
What the fuck is going on!!!???
Sometimes my portfolio goes up a couple hundred dollars in a minute or two and I can't even tell which stock is doing it.
Hmmm. Smell like a loophole

Yeah I didn‚Äôt see that. Hooray gridlock.
Today feels like the kind of day you get to dust off the Dow 29k and Dow 26k hats in the same trading day. Be careful take profits when you can and hedge!
No one knows who will be president yet, but senate likely stays republican majority, meaning tax increases are unlikely.

You Americans talking about Biden like he's left need to come to Europe sometime. Your left is our centre right- thinking the Overton window has shifted to the left is an absolutely comical take.
This. Paper trading thread should be weekly. So newbs can learn the way of autism
Ending up or down today?
Biden could barely stand talking last night. You think he is going to make it much longer?
remember like last week when the market had like one of the worst weeks ever?  yeah that was when most of this was all priced in.

The polls and media were intentionally bigly slanted towards Biden to condition you into eventually accepting his win and not going out to riot. This election is likely to be mired in litigations and the funny thing is, this was already pretty plain to see before going in. When Biden gave his speech, he was down massively and I mean by incredible margins. But he just oozed confidence and went to sleep right after. It would seem that the fix is in.
Really? Maybe you're right... I see Biden with a pretty substantial lead in ME?
Never playing VIX derivatives again. Predicted a Biden win with Trump throwing a hissy fit and VIX popping off du to uncertainty.  
  
Nope, VIX got sent to the shadow realm instead!

We are all wondering why the market hasn't crashed due to a contested election. Just keep in mind we don't have a contested election yet. We almost certainly will though. That's when uncertainty can take hold and help with a sell off.
Lockdown asap.
Wait, so is it

silver man = good for market

orange man = bad for market?
None of this is normal. Including politicizing a global pandemic. This isn't rocket science, literally every political scientist knew this was coming. Biden supporters voted overwhelmingly through mail while Trump supporters showed up in person. There is no mystery

The oil industry doesn't have good books even with current subsidies - neither party is going to pay them to drill like they do in Russia. Why? Low oil prices are for the most part good for the US economy. 

Trump himself boasts about how great it is to have low gas prices - other than during elections where he's pandering to Pittsburgh. 

Renewables are also a game of subsidies - and also not profitable with current subsidies. 

Honestly, the only thing that could bring back the US drilling industry is unintuitively banning fracking - removing 8 million barrels of oil per day of production in the next 2 years will skyrocket the price per barrel - opening up the offshore industry and long forgotten basins - neither one of these candidates are going to do it.

Do you think these are positive or negatives?
It‚Äôll probably dump again this week. Always does.

Big red FL and TX are almost done. Big blue Cali and NY are just over half way. I don‚Äôt think anyone was calling for a 12% popular vote win but 3-4% is definitely on the table
When people say not a democracy, they really mean not a direct democracy, which kinda weakens the slogan, since it allows for the US to be other types of democracies.
Then I wouldn't be retarded
Will fall
This is precisely it. In Europe with their "free education" not everyone can go and you pay taxes out the ass forever. In America, the students will pay out the ass forever, but they can all go. So do we want no student debt and only 25% of college aged kids in college, or the system now where those 25% get tons of aid and scholarships and the rest pay for it in loans.

Well. I‚Äôm feeling completely fucked. My only hope is that the fact I‚Äôm holding Jan 15s will save me. Need a solid earnings with great guidance.

LIMIT DOWN GET UR PUTS IN NOW LETS GOOOO
Cause trump won?
Ouch
Price target?
Do I hold my puts expiring in January or sell? I am done with this. This market is manipulated, fake, and made up. Im not playing this game anymore.
Bulls like to eat NIO dips for breakfast they just waking up
IV crush and theta helping my call credit spread. Gamma and Delta trying to fuck me.
I just bought tan calls because biden plans to push solar/clean energy. But then I remembered how much it's went up already into the election. I just bought the news didn't I? People bought in for the hype. Now that the presidential earnings report is out everyone's going to jump ship. I'm a retard.
My 1/2021 calls love that
Trump stop crying into your pillow and get on Twitter!
I was told that it is because he is from Kentucky and the way I understand it everyone there is retarded, like there is something in the air that makes your brain transform into a potato or something.
Nah hold it
might as well sub up to r/investing and start buying VTI
His tax plan was just to get the crazy leftist vote, he would never do that shit.
okay let‚Äôs say that gives biden another 2%, still far from that 12% some polls had
Sell CSPs at the strike you wouldn't mind paying if assigned.

If only it was available on fanduel I would have bet and cashed out this morning smh
Lets take a moment of silence for VXX call holders üôè
Bears voted for Trump because he made them relevant. Market only goes uppies with Biden.
Trump won already
They've been saying for months wall street backed biden
[removed]
aaaaaaaaaaand im broke
it's expected to be red, but who knows i guess
So let me get this right - polls, futures and betting markets combined didn't price in a Sleepy win until around 4.30am ET when they collectively realised millions of postal votes were still in play. Sounds legit and believable ü§°
Just bottomed 440 eod
Bought more spy calls. Inverse me for free money.
Don't worry, kanye says he's gonna win in 2024
Vix calls in shambles
i bought at open like a dumbass

i still think trump is gonna take this to the court so there‚Äôs a small chance
Either way the vast majority of people won‚Äôt be effected by the outcome no need to be stressed. Everyone is still waking up and going to work today, the world is still gonna spin regardless
.... yes.   Yes I am.
Same for my sqqq.
It‚Äôs mad sus and should he looked at. Statistically speaking 140,000 clear cut votes at once shouldn‚Äôt be possible. It‚Äôs just the sort of fuckup and oversight I‚Äôd expect from human average though
You've never been to backwoods Kentucky have you?
Dude you and this whole sub doesn‚Äôt k now what VXX actually is. Do your research

The Obama presidency was very moderate.  Clinton basically invented the modern centrist Dem approach. Biden is Biden. What more do you want?
Won‚Äôt report until tomorrow.
What up w vix, the tesla call I sold at open already down 500&

There is literally no scenario in which the market would drop. It will just keep mooning no matter whatever the fuck happens in the world. The entire world population could go AIDS and die and stocks would still rally.
At this point I might sell 2 or 3 of the my 5 total. Hope to an earnings beat and a jump to get back to even
VIX down 15%. 

Yep, no volatility at all here.

They knew this was coming way ahead of time. They could've prepared a different set of people to work during the night while the previous shift sleeps. This is basic Walmart employee level shit.
The election spiked volatility. The election happened and stocks made their consequential large move. So expected volatility going forward is down.
so um how were the polls so so wrong again? trump is only down 2% in the popular vote... far from the 12% some of the polls estimated
It‚Äôs also very interesting to see the areas within red states that vote blue, all highly prosperous and educated university cities.

TGTX presentation coming up friday, get in
Fasho buddy, clearly you don‚Äôt have respect for the country we live in and the rights we have as Americans. You should go to the Middle East if you don‚Äôt care who wins
Link?
Yeah I thought it would provoke major reactions but everybody, including his base, was like 'uhm ok' and then proceeded with following the results and what not.
We don‚Äôt do that here
bro we are in contested election territory and the market is pumping wtf
Do you remember 2000? We didn‚Äôt have an answer till December because of hAnGiNg ChADs
Trump said big stimulus today if he wins. What is Bidens stance.
the tactics are: print and outsprint
Why is TSLA getting fucked so bad
Yeah but the odds of a person being an idiot are higher for those without an education. Did you know a lot of adults in America cant even read?
fucking dems already taking my shit!
Agree

Maybe some bipartisanship will return
What? News wants riots it increases ratings
TAN, ICLN, BMRG, VALE
Buy into something else that hasn't been pumped for over a week
Its bear time
Then LYFT is to Mars üòÜ
It's the same people that think Obama was a Kenyan and Michelle is a man.
Go all in ... show us your loss porn later..
It will delay stimulus till seats are actually changed. So next early spring. Which is fine, thats only a couple months where current stimulus isn't in effect. I think biden will executive order one immediately after swearing in. Or trump will pass one this week for 2021 if he wins.
Iv crush that‚Äôs why I sold spreads. Happens with any binary event like elections or earnings
I lost 1400 since Monday for retard puts. Its ok. We live and learn.
Man isnt the point to avoid a civil war, not win it
Red senate will save portfolio
Let's just hope Bolsonaro keeps his mouth shut then.
Or just throw all your money into Tesla and 10% of it into NIO. Or you can big dick NIO. It‚Äôs up to you
At this point I‚Äôm riding my VXX calls until expiration. Oh well
Profits taking, no one wants to hold with the election. Nothing but good news for NIO the past 2 weeks, but people are nervous with Gyna companies when the election could (even though it will now) affect the company

Nothing  about today makes sense lol. We thought this shit was manipulated before.
Right lol
Bears kill
You are severely lacking in critical thinking skills. Trump was actively telling voters to vote in person, and was downplaying COVID the whole time. The Dems treated the pandemic situation with a healthy dose of reality and encouraged mail voting. It's not hard to see how it could be overwhelmingly pro-Dem on the mail ins.
Republicans won the senate - the presidency doesn't matter since either it's total gridlock or trump
Playing long term PLUG call.
Profits are profits
Should‚Äôve just left that money in your piggy bank
SWBI RGR ENPG TAN. See what I did there? They‚Äôre red tickers!
It'll be refreshing not having Trump in office. Red Senate will prevent all the bullshit taxes dementia man was wanting to impose. Won't be as bad as people think.
What this country really needs is a president that cheats on his wife, get bjs in the oval office, and bang playboy models. Those were the boom times

We‚Äôre living through history rn. Whether you‚Äôre winning or losing don‚Äôt take this time for granted.  

One day the market will be extremely different, JPOW won‚Äôt be chairman, trump will have been 10 presidents ago, and you‚Äôll be talking about the chaos of the ‚Äúold days‚Äù.
Panic sold everything this morning. I opened up 4 short S&P Emini contracts to hedge before market open but it looks like that was unnecessary.

That‚Äôs the real question, Australian options are out of the question, major Australian brokers like stake and self wealth are planning to bring out options trading for the US markets at some point next year bc of the high demand.

Robinhood did say they were coming to Australia 5-6 years ago, that never happened.
They'll scream fraud on social media, but there won't be riots. And they have a right to call for investigations, the pattern of all blue cities STOPPING counting last night as trump was winning. Like wtf. Then they say oh wait we have more mail in ballots. But whatever. Senate and court is red, good news for market imo
I should have sold at open. Was up $300 and now only $50 üò¢

Even if Trump doesn‚Äôt get NV or MI, if he holds GA, NC, PA and AK, he still wins presidency and AK isn‚Äôt even thought to be contested.

This being said, Trump needs to hold all of ME besides the one already called to Biden, if he loses one, it‚Äôs very possible it goes 269 - 269.

Yeah. Those calls were so out of the money and expiring so soon that the only way they'd churn a profit is if the stimulus plan happened today. If you had a couple years of time behind those options, it'd be a brilliant plan, tho.

I am a buyer of JPM near 95.  This has been a huge winner from 95 to 105.  If I can get that trade one more time, I will take it!
Look at the states by GDP for capita and you will see the dem states are not only much richer. But also have a much higher education rate.
We could have had John Kasich instead of mango. At least this guy has a damn conscience

Your logic here boils down to "xilinx was a mistake, I know better than AMD's leadership what is best for their company".

Not saying you're wrong, but I would like to know why adding a no-growth company to a growth company to make a hybrid is a negative.
The guy could start building concentration camps and they'd find something else to report on
There‚Äôs no news, 3 states too close to call
Nio keep dumping so i can get some discount calls, people are just taking profits especially with this election bs

down 3k since open. FUCK this market
If Joe Biden wins he will be a neutered president if republicans control one of the chambers of congress. This means no sweeping mandates. He may revert some of Trumps tough on China talk, which is a big mistake for human rights and long term stability, but corporations will be happy.
there were so many racist comments in that trash sub last night lmao. the party of tolerance.

Yeah because you have to be really slow to not realize that it isn't worth the opportunity cost in 90%+ of the cases. Not to mention academic research in itself is an extremely dry and boring task that can directly rot your brain.

Guns baby such is the play
I voted for Biden.

Liberals are annoying. 

Biden can win but the Senate is still red so a boring next 4 years. 

Republican president in 2024.
TSLA red. This is illegal
Premature ejaculation celebration.
It's all mail-in's left and in urban areas. There's no significant votes left for Trump if I understand correctly - in NV.
Senate is Republican. No tax increases. If Biden wins it balances out and nothing extreme happens. Companies get to make money and spend money while Biden is a pretty little social-justice puppet
This is your chance to get the NIO dip
[deleted]
red senate, Biden presidency = stonks go up bigly. This is gonna be the year of the buck baby. spy leaps buy at close, sell next day at open. it's gonna be easy mode in 2021

I bought 2 days ago - made 8% until now. I think it still goes alright.
Yes but they were under the a assumption big tech was only benefiting the left. Clearly that wasn't the case.

Why‚Äôs that?
A creative POTUS can greatly accelerate green energy without congress. 

‚ÄúAll federal procurement must prioritize EV, then hybrid, before buying combustion vehicles.‚Äù That affects military, law enforcement, parks, all the fed agencies, literally millions of vehicles. 

Could also stop new fossil fuel leases while granting infinite 0% interest loans on clean energy plants. 

No states that give fossil subsidies get federal funding.
These RKT calls are going to print
WEEEEEEED? COULD WE SEE A HUGE REBOUND?
Is that true? Why are the odds still in his favor then?

Yup exactly. Trump has GA, NC, and PA. Those will be his state. All Trump needs is **either** NV (8k Biden lead) **or** MI. I'd place my bet with Trump over Biden.

It's always hilarious when Republicans/Trumpers call Dems "socialist" and accuse them of wanting free stuff, meanwhile almost every single Republican state is a welfare state, mostly propped by tax dollars from Dem states.

One side was overwhelmingly telling voters to be cautious because of the global pandemic and vote by mail while the other side was saying there is no global pandemic threat anymore and there is no need to vote through mail. It is not surprising at all that Biden supporters voted in disproportionately greater numbers through mail. Quit lying

Everyone with a brain understands Covid is bullshit and lockdowns destroy economies. 

You are ritarded if your voting for more lockdowns and medical martial law.

If you want freedoms gone, and hard left ideologies move to France or UK or Italy or Australia... The people who live their are pissed tho... So...?
If he gets MI and everything else.  MI isn't looking likely right now though.
Then maybe we shouldn't lock stuff down
Why is solar crashing ?
There it is son.......that strange sensation you're feeling.....that's IV crush..... That's what happens when you spend private time with questionable contracts and you don't use protection....

Yep sounds like something they would say
Many of them.  But there have been a lot of old people who believed this was a hoax, who died.  And who still will as it spreads through rural areas.

Wow wow wow hold up ... isn‚Äôt a Biden win good for Tesla? The fuck? Why is TSLA dropping like a rock when Narcolepsy is leading but surge when mango is leading?
if trump stopped right now, WI, MI and NV would go to sleepy and he would win

gotta wait until the pendulum swings slightly in your favor then stop the count and throw out all the remaining votes... you know, in the name of 'democracy'

I would have agreed with this at 2 A.M., but this election just keeps getting closer.  If biden starts locking in some of these states... we are gonna see some crazy swings today.  

Strangle all the way
Hmmm thanks for the knowledge.

How does spy go up 4 bucks yet my calls are down?
Yes. An enlightened society is paramount to maintain a free society.

States should either get algorithms to district states or adopt pr

Or, we can pull a robert a heinlein and only allow people who demonstrate commitment to their nation to vote /s
I dunno what happened, but like a minute before opening it looked like I was up huge for some reason. Then as soon as it opened back to reality. So close to riches!
I mean Biden will likely win, but Congress did pretty well for Republicans which is actually pretty shitty for the markets imo

Seconded

Somebody consult their crystal ball and let me know if we mooning or tanking from here.
BABA just got a price upgrade from Raymond James
Or buy tbh
Are you kidding? If Biden finally takes it, the Left will have learned that the higher the body count of their tantrums the more likely they are to get what they want. Things would only get worse because Joe "shubadagubawubada is a human right" Biden will cave every time.
because alzheimer
ABBV, NVDA, SBUX are printing money for today.  I have raised cash this morning as I believe we have had a solid bounce from the recent decline.  The buying today is pretty strong.

It‚Äôs more state legislatures fault imo. The states still counting crippled their abilities to do anything proactively. The states that did count mail/early vote quickly was due to the opposite.
Because they've been undervalued for a while, and is making up for the lack of rally compared to this other tech counterparts

Submitted news to FDA . FDA has 30 days to lift halt or squish them permanently. Also earnings on Monday.
Good morning America üá∫üá∏
CGC calls if Biden wins? Any idea why it‚Äôs down today? Is it cause of senate control
> Rug pull ~~soon~~ now

fixed it for ya.
üòÇ
CMG going up üöÄüöÄüöÄ i guess no matter who wins, assholes are getting blown up üôàüôàüôà
He does though
crsr hits 26 today I'm taking a dab rip for the boys

&#x200B;

EDIT: YOU DOWNVOTED ME BUT IT HIT 26 SO DABS FOR YOU SUCKKSAAA BEARSSS BLOWWW HAHAHA
Thoughts on baba after it‚Äôs huge dump???
Doesn‚Äôt matter, almost every boomer is conservative. They want their social security
You still think trump is winning??? Lmfao
[deleted]
But the problem is that senate is still red. So they cant vote shit no?
Bought my first option in months and it was a PUT on Cronos. I thought well Trump is going to win and marijuana stocks will tank and wtf do you know. THEY TANK.
OH GOD DO I SELL NOW OR DO I HOLD
Hahaha, I am. Legalized in 2 more states...imo TLRY and CGC are just straight up buys
Ok imma do that then
Someone turn the market off and on again what the fuck is going on
Markets were pricing in civil war and it didn't happen so here we moon.
Looks like
The market was closed at 11 and I sold for a 90% gain this morning. Find your play, plan it, trade it.
Price in.
[removed]
why google up so much
Market pumps regardless LOL
Yeah holding through earnings. Hopefully presidency doesn‚Äôt effect it too much. It normally does it‚Äôs own thing, regardless of the rest of the market.
Exactly. Trump won. Bunch of idiots. I tell you
Trampoline pull soon
Bought some VIX 40c 11/18 üò¨
[deleted]
you apparently give a shit. square bitch. keep shilling your shitty weed stock
id laugh if trump misses the mark by 200,000 votes

talk about fucking yourself sideways
Loaded up on calls and now we start falling üñïüèª
Maybe my PLUG shares will be safe
ALL IN GREEN ENERGY LEAPS SEE YALL IN APRIL
LoL apparently senior staff at white house say trump had a meltdown panic attack before tweeting that he won last night
Spending is determined by Congress. Biden can push all he wants but it's unlikely that a red Senate will approve of the kind of investment people were hoping for.
Damn y'all are really bearish on a bright green day...
Red senate
Yes
Hot take: that‚Äôs a hot take
yes ur retarded u just got fomo'd and chased like a lil bitch
Sold 11/6 UVXY at a 60% loss bought 11/20 bc its all of nothing :|
[deleted]
Nobody wanted to wake up and get out of bed today, I'll bet.
he already did, did everyone forget that happened last night?
Inside trading. I don't see 50/50 chance at play, rather a well interconnected network of media and market insiders.
Their system of multilateral fueling of sentiment in the public (many small account traders) and then trading against those defies any DD on our side.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking
Yes, you‚Äôll fit right in
Holding mine, wait for mango to tweet
Holy fuck this market is cancer
Okay so why not prepare for it so this doesn‚Äôt happen?  Idk maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it. Just kind of annoying I guess.
I didn't get out in time F
Doesn‚Äôt matter
havent slept either
If blue man‚Äôs supposed to win, is weed the move? It‚Äôs rekt right now
Not during his presidency though.
*it‚Äôs entirely possible*
EOD
Received alerts saying stocks opened higher, checked the market and most were red except FANG
Rip uvxy calls. Never again am I playing something like that.
BABA why!?
Guess there‚Äôs more white trash dems than redneck Republicans in Michigan now. That state is such a shit show

I‚Äôll rather have kids get denied trying to buy legalized drugs than getting it easily from drug dealers who have no remorse
Thats new means still upside. I reckon it will keep getting new targets frequently
Just buy a few and if it dips then you buy more.
maybe it already priced in Biden being president for 2 terms in a row
*knocks on door*

Hello sir, I am CEO of the NIO

Biden is your moderate.
wheeling and dealing this morning.  sold out of APPS up 50%.  doubled down on FUBO 11/20 15c when it dropped.  Sold half my SPY 339, then bought back on the drop.  Trying to sell out of CRSR 25c 11/20.  

Holding APPL 109p 11/6 for now.
NIO eow?
Buy more

[deleted]
How the markets are all up right now is beyond me
People shook about earnings

Pick up ICLN for cheap before market realizes Biden won?
Really? Aight time to get in
2/31 80 held through earnings üôà. Just about broke even but would have been up that fucking sell at open was nuts
Why the fuck are you asking so many questions in the WSB daily thread. You must truly belong here
Holding calls through earnings, but January expiration
Elaborate ? With Biden he will still push renewables
Already am. Except PINS

people still gotta scrapbook
I have a deposit coming fucking Friday.  I am buying puts 40 Itm.  I am willing to get hurt again
11/20
Mango doesn't need either of those states

Would be perfect if Biden says "you're fired" when trump loses. He will lose his shit haha
Aight fr. Thanks
no shot
Im not sure on that with replublicans have been waving angry fists at social media lately. Now for the other tech i think youre right
My shit has lost 90% value
Trump told all of his voters to go in person for an ED wave. They did it. Just accept it
Biden is literally a manila envelope.
Idk man April was pretty good
Bought calls fuck that bear shit
As we all suspected.
Bye bye Michael Vix......
[deleted]
Aight may as well. Yolo
Thank you PFE. Kept me at even for the day.
Hahah u idiots fucking roasted me for saying if joe got NE 2 and Michigan and Wisconsin he was going to win. Fuck you
What about gerrymandering?  Either we should have a direct democracy of well informed voters or we keep our current system.  With the complexities of politics and the money that controls all of it I think our current system is the better choice as far as capitalism is concerned.  If you want things to be fair and equal then a direct democracy would be needed but first an overhaul of our current education system and way of life must happen.  People need to know very powerful institutions are deeply invested in our current system and they want to keep control of it by any means necessary.  Ignorance is blissful happiness but knowledge is power.  What do you want most of in your life?
Same question
Both. Kang Gang and Theta Gang only winners.
Mail in ballots don‚Äôt get opened until after the buzzer in a lot of states

Do Donnie supporters not realize that the 200,000 dead from covid where mostly his demographic? Mfs didn‚Äôt want to wear a mask and they where old aka conservative fucking **BOOMERS**. Trump fucked himself over in order to stick it to the libs üòÇ
80% unrealized is nothing. Id say just take 80% and wait until 10:30-11 to decide if you continue for the day.
Lost most of my gains from last week on this stupid overnight pump. Wanted to pick up some puts but all this uncertainty probably gonna take us to 350
Biden is about as moderate as you'll get
I do find it really weird that we haven‚Äôt determined a winner. That everyone just got sent home after polling hours and stopped counting? Like wtf. All those states who haven‚Äôt finished counting can hold this L forever.
My diamond hands have never been so tested than they have this past week
People must love liberals if Joe won and your buddy Trump lost.
Isn't he already boning an alien? He even made an alien kid...
Bynd tendies served on spce flights to the motherfucking moon?
I mean, he is losing
Can't trade options on unclear deposit on TD

I'm just looking forward to him getting pissed every time someone doesn't address him as Former President Donald J. Trump.
BABA what we doing
I am them

Yes many things that he says smell of unfair dictatorship. He‚Äôs scared
Unless theres some really out of left field shit like China shutting them down from the inside or some kind of crazy tariff I really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre imagining will happen
A president who believes in science and global warming would be refreshing
Ameripoors tanking all gains
I think blue presidency (who knows on that yet) and red senate would be a good sign for stocks since they can balance each other. Same idea as a blue house and red senate
Link?
Here comes the big selloff. Biden gonna win. Trump gonna tweet something stupid.

Get out!
[deleted]
A different problem is that people think anyone who voted for Trump is a "Lunatic". That's not true and I think it stems from the confirmation bias that people get on social and traditional media.
For how long are you holding? EOD or EOW?
Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôll buy the dip
It ran up because everyone thought Biden was a sure thing. Also, one of their greenhouses had a big fire a few days ago but not sure if that is the reason for the drop [https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/smoke-from-delta-greenhouse-fire-visible-from-across-the-region](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/smoke-from-delta-greenhouse-fire-visible-from-across-the-region)
Markets thought trump was gonna win for a minute so cannabis tanked.

Thinking it‚Äôll bounce back today
Printer go brrr, except for mail in ballots lmao
Ah got ya. I hope so! I still believe HYLN is a great buy.
Come on VIX do something
How so if trump is winning ?
[removed]
I clearly don't understand the definition of volatility 

VXX wtf is you doin
Drillqueens going down quick
This is unrealistic.  Who tf buys wicker furniture unless you‚Äôve got a beach house?  We can‚Äôt afford that shit
[deleted]
You're dumb as fuck if you honestly think every mail in ballots is a fraud. We have systems in place to prevent such things, and not one piece of evidence has been provided to show the democrats rigging this election. So please, shut the fuck up dumbass. Maybe stop listening to Trump
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
calling for fraud was priced in? wtf vix
Don‚Äôt bring the holy figure into this shit.  He fuck an alien Tesla stock goes to 5k. Let him fuck the aliens. He‚Äôs not doing for himself but for humanity
Market waiting for  üçä to tweet something crazy.
TSLA bout to turn red after going up 14-15 in PM
Welcome to the north
Jpow isn't jewish
The % difference between SPY, IWM, and QQQ is crazy right now
NV is the key to all of this.
Why is TD ameritrade rejecting my order? Trying to open a straddle that takes up a bit less than half my buying power and it just rejects it every time instantly. I deposited the funds into my account last night but have had this account active for years anyway so it‚Äôs not my first deposit. Any ideas?
Lol you bought any yet?
Don‚Äôt question it just buy tech calls like it‚Äôs August
Nah. It's because without a blue Senate, the green deal can't pass.
My bad misread
Sold AAPL calls at open, bought AAL shares with profit. Mhmmm what to do.
Republican Senate is why we're jumping. They can stop the tax increases. And a stimulus is coming either way. Biden or Trump, doesn't really matter at this point.
ü§£
I hope we get someone in office who is near the middle on the political spectrum sometime in my lifetime. Our enemies want us divided as a nation and we are too ignorant to work towards a common goal. I guess the only thing that unites us is war or national tragedies...
[deleted]
Every bad news is priced in, good news moons the stock market, nothing matters, bears are gay and bulls rule the day forever.
Also consider that Trump is in office til Jan, not pushing for a stimmy is only gonna fuck future Republican runs (not like trump gives a shit about the GOP/America)
Holy shit has anything ducked share holders harder than SEDG the last two days?
What the fuck is wrong with vix
[deleted]
Now your just looking like a sore loser haha
Drug use should be legal. Selling drugs should not be. The government should still try and remove it, but locking people up for using doesnt help society
Lockdown fears.
Ughhhh NIO?
People have been asking this every day since 30 was ATH

Get the fuck in already. Shares and long dated calls
Will VXX ever rise again? Feels like a nuke can go off and you wont see it move.
[deleted]
So when are they going to legalize weed nationwide?  Can Joe just sign an executive order? Time to long MJ?
Lmfao I hope not. I got covered calls at $20 ü§°
it hasn't been about policies for years, thank arthur finkelstein

voting trump out is a first step in the correct direction in my opinion if we hope for more policy-minded campaigning

Glad my DKNG calls didn't go through at open
Biden pulls ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin.  Mango era coming to a close.
If you didn't BTFD..... You literally are missing the best chance of your trading life thus far, I was bear back then.... Please don't tell anyone
They don‚Äôt have to make him try and look bad. He does it himself everyday. Like declaring victory prematurely lol
Late December / early January for two reasons:

1- There will be a huge, huge COVID wave after Thanksgiving / the holidays. May merit another set of lockdowns given hospital capacity etc. Europe is getting fked right now and it's inevitable we will too, but harder of course

2- Profit taking year end will probably result in downard pressure in addition to the above
ICLN shitting, the market believes Donny will win

11/13 UVXY calls?? Anyone grabbing these also?
[deleted]
If Biden can hold onto MI and WI, he needs one of the following four:

GA  
NC  
PA  
NV + AK (Not Likely)

EDIT: It‚Äôll be the following four:

GA  
NC  
PA  
NV + ME (2 out of 3 outstanding)

I just couldn't vote for Biden. There's too much old school corruption on that whole side. That's the only way he even got nominated. I do feel bad, though.
probably a good dip to buy if you think sleepy is going to win. solar has been uber jumpy the last few weeks
Take what exactly to the Supreme Court? What is the issue? What's he going to argue? "Doh duh doh, they counting votes and I'm losing! Stop the counting? Please?"

If you sold everything last week or early this week (in anticipation of a dip), and you are experiencing FOMO (because the market's been GREEN all week), and you are thinking about diving back into the market, don't be an idiot. Not only did you sit out the small rally this week, you will get hurt when the market dips inevitably by the end of the week.

But we will appreciate your loss porn

Calling himself the winner and saying to stop counting votes. He's the one messing with the democratic system now. I do think the other side has done that during Trumps whole term but I find that equally unacceptable. Just nothing seems good about this.

i feel like a lot of the older democrats are probably biden supporters, and i know some obama die-hards who are on the biden bus for sure. but i'd say you're right a large number of biden votes were more against trump than they were pro biden.

just like 2016 when a large number of trump votes were anti hillary
Damn fading quick
Thats not true at all. NBA went all in on Biden but outside of that its not true at all. Most hockey, MLB, and NFL players spoke up for MAGAs.

for those in the U.S., is Biden expected to win at this point? I'm in Korea and they're saying Trump will win lol
Biden would already have a landslide victory, the electoral college is the only thing keeping it close. He‚Äôs up 2% over all with the big red states (TX, FL) pretty much done counting and the big blue (NY, Cali) only a little over half.

I think a big issue this election is going to be the number of people who voted but didn‚Äôt make an Instagram post with an ‚ÄúI voted sticker.‚Äù 

After all, without this photo proof, how can we be sure the ballot was even cast? Will be interesting to see how the Supreme Court rules on this one.

Oh boy I'm down a lot today. Gg bulls.
Like a mutant with shitty powers
Good, stability and a centrist candidate. VP of the man who was President during the greatest bull run in American history. Easy Stonks go up.
Possibly, it means handover might not be smooth, and he might screen around until January.

It might also embolden a republican senate to be more obstructive over stim

I fully expect this is how it will play out. He will also claim it is all fake and a fraud, which might unfortunately harm faith in democratic institutions for years to come.

This election will go on for awhile... recounts, arguing over what votes count what votes don't (anyone remember hanging chads from 2000, prepare for something like that with late arriving votes and unsigned ballots etc) court cases... none of this means "democracy is over" I would expect it from an election this close no matter who was running

Tfw alien gf only 3 tentacles when all qt pi alien gf hav 10 tentacles. :(
What's the bet?
By that same reasoning it shouldn't matter if we've got an electoral college. The popular vote never has a large difference.

People in the 10 to 15 biggest cities would decide every election. People in Chicago have zero business dictating policy for Nevada or Texas and people in NY have no business making decisions for those in Alabama or Idaho.

It's the best way to equalize representation across the country for the executive branch. Largest states already have more electoral votes as a compromise.

Without it huge swaths of the country would be ignored by the executive bc they lack vote density.

why is the stock market delayed by an hour? used to start at 930pm but its not yet opened? btw its GMT+8 for me so yeah
Exactly trump wins again. Trump train. Choo choo
i could see trump running again assuming he isn't still in prison
[removed]
either way it goes a big green dildo is coming
NIO you beautiful bastard
You think China trashed the world just to try to affect the election that actually turned out statistically almost the same as last year and still we don‚Äôt even know who won?
No I don't and I base that off of inside info. I've seen internal emails from overnight stating exactly that, from friends and family on the inside, that the large firms are speculating a Biden win. I have no fucking clue what the result of that might be, but there it is.

Obviously that can change in a second but that's the scuttlebutt.
Prepare for uncharted territory
Hold the line!
Yes but you can't drive a car
Y‚Äôall mind if I wild out ?
Calls or puts?
Come on, VIX. Just gap up for a little bit :(
Why is solar down biggly?
"With the election going down this way with uncertainty, I think we will see a massive panic selloff. The market doesn't like uncertainty; its proven it time and time again. Thats why I'm going with 345 0dte today"
You look at them.
>iv crush

nope, price drop = reflected in IV
We got the worst possible outcome from the election for the markets: no clear winner, both senate and house are split, highly contested, but stocks are still mooning hard.
Think I'm sell my NIO calls today. Everytime its hit a high it drops hella hard.
You are missing a lot. That‚Äôs simply not true
*Naughty America jotting down notes*
Erection
Civil war priced in.
Seems like Biden has MI - looks like most of the outstanding votes are expected to come from Detroit where Biden is running up the score
Depending on strike, I think you might be ok. Biden wins and then starts talking shut downs and shit is gonna move
Bad redneck bad
No, not even a little
#TikTokNews
Price increase on NIO by Citigroup according to another reddit user. 

 "Citi analyst Jeff Chung raised the firm's price target on NIO Inc. to $46.40 from $33.20 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst has a bullish view of China's new energy vehicle sector and believes NIO has a better product cycle in 2021. "

11/20 SPY puts are going to print
Everything that is being counted right now are absentee ballots 

Trump was winning when strictly counting folks that showed up to the polls which were mostly republicans across the country.

Imagine the Dakotas get 4 senators and Cali only gets two.
When do we start YOLOing tech calls again?
[deleted]
2 minutes people
It‚Äôs always been that way. No one in America wants to foot the bill themselves. That‚Äôs why we just blame everything on billionaires (because there‚Äôs so few of them)
It was honestly never in doubt. Even Trump knew, which is why he had the theatrics over calling it last night.
Donnie won‚Äôt go after them
I‚Äôve been waiting for this. Thank you!
Short squeeze masquerading as a bullish sentiment, classic
lol anybody signing onto Uber/Lyft as a driver should've expected to get fucked over anyway, unless you're retarded. the entire business model is just undercutting taxis even if it means consistently losing money, until they figure out robo-taxis and then the drivers are completely fucked.
last night was a cesspool in here saying trump raped biden lmfaoo
If you hate what both parties have become, a Biden presidency and a GOP senate is the best outcome. 2020 finally showed us mercy.
SPY green rocket. I guess they had an amazing earnings report and confident guidance, huh?

\#1 response in this sub to questions about market movement that they don't understand.

= It's all built in
There is no way trump gonna win and there is no way he is going out of the office peacefully so be careful with your calls you been warned
CGC dead
They are uppies
So does it just cash out at the delta value of the stock and the call price or will it be lower or higher?
That wasn't going to happen...  but the democrats will open up the gates for renewable energy with less resistance the Republicans.  But I think it would happen either way.
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm headed...the stress ain‚Äôt worth it
What am I missing as long as mango wins PA he can lose everything else and still win. Right?

Don't even play around on expiration day. RH expires worthless options around noon but I have seen horror stories.
I'm personally jumping in at open on the sell side
[deleted]
Buy more! Always.
I only trust one retard and that is my dick. My dick points up whenever I think of nio, stonks only go up, doubling down on nio
Hmm makes sense. Thanks
Absolutely stupid they get less electoral college votes per capita than pretty much any other state and gets one senator. Biden is likely to win the popular vote by 5+% and you are complaining Trump hasn't been given enough of an advantage, absolutely stupid.
Yeah I agree. Tech feels like a trap
Let's make some money senor
Futures gapped up last night when it was looking like a Trump victory and went down when things were turning around, then gapped up again.
BURN SPY BURN
We are going to find out the winner during market hours, wild
[deleted]
some of you retards really have to learn how to spell "election" and then type it into google..

biden is leading WI and MI and NV right now
hes been the betting favorite for a few hours now... im sure the market wouldve reacted

Sell and switch to 11/20 puts
I‚Äôm holding shares long term then I run option call sometimes .. few of my shares in discount so why not buy it back up again if they offering it

P sure it is
Kamala‚Äôs going to be getting her pussy eaten in the Oval Office
Just hold until day after expiration
All in on calls at open?
Trump's Twitter has a bigger effect on your puts than r/politics. Maybe that's why you've been losing money.
yep but last night was looking very like a repeat of Trump 2016. on the flip side, i have been long calls in the market. still positive though overall
I should be -99% at open. Disgusting iv crush coming.
this surprised me, thought it had no chance
700 in VXX calls expire friday. F...
>lol kinda has been a safe investment over the past few months

1) So therefore it's a safe investment?

2) Define "nasty money"

3) Want to buy some more calls?  I'll sell you as many as you want today!
All in on puts? Tbh even if trump throws a bitch fit will stonks really go down? We all know that stonks only go up
Nah, look at the swing states percentages.
Why the Health insurance stocks up so much?
Props if that‚Äôs real. Inverse WSB....
Trump jr
Biden an absolute piece of shit, ain‚Äôt no stimulus Republicans still own that senate
[deleted]
Its overvalued af. They dont even make this much profit per share
the future is bright no mater who wins lol
Stimulus was dead the second Mitch got his next term
Looks like it's all coming down to Nevada. Wow

*assuming trump takes NC, GA, and PA
Imagine being so dumb you vote in a man with dementia as your president.
Does jpow talk today or tomorrow
Sell profits and buy long call contracts. Don‚Äôt overthink this
Can someone explain to me why this is good for big tech
I wonder if I can get a refund for mine since I already paid them off.
Except Mitch won't even bring up a stimulus for vote, so those 1-2 senators looking to flip doesn't matter

Puts on this guys reasoning
TSLA 450 please
Priced in with the higher implied volatility, 

vix was in backwardation thanks to the election, election is over, so is probably going back in contango
I take no responsibility
My spy puts all fucked so what do I do sell at open?

I went in on GRWG yesterday. 5/5 states passing and Biden win is best case scenario and premarket is mooning
pennsylvania count slower than my ass in k-4
I'm not so sure...
Sell half
I actually do have concerns about this but maybe she‚Äôll grow into the roll or people will warm up.
SPY you little bitch, drill!
It only drops if they miss earnings or there's Chinese funny business.  They just delivered more vehicles than expected so I wouldn't count on an earnings miss.  They're estimated at EPS of -1.08, which was their actual number in the previous quarter.

Trailing Stop Quote is your friend that'll protect you if the bottom falls out.
It‚Äôs up over 1% bro
Looks like sleepy joe gonna win this lmao  üçä is gonna go nuts

Straight jinxed it
Surprised the CNBC headline this morning wasn‚Äôt, ‚ÄúFutures skyrocketed this morning as hopes on COVID-19  stimulus rise‚Äù
How would you actually play a Biden or trump win is it really trump means up Biden means down
It‚Äôs so tricky, I lost $2k yesterday on puts so I‚Äôm in make up mode and counting that. Maybe that‚Äôs the stop,... so it‚Äôs a break even 2 days at worst
Puts on the planet
I just woke up and saw that Michigan and Wisconsin turned blue. Wasn't expecting it.
republican senate keeps this one mooning.. no historic stimulus
45.. 46... 47.. I'm in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I ain‚Äôt touching shit for the next week.  Unless it‚Äôs more NIO.

Oh I like this idea, you‚Äôre hired!
Today‚Äôs plan, close my $TNA covered calls since they‚Äôre like $5 OTM and probably milked all it got. Then, watch it and $AAPL for any action and sell more covered calls. These guys want to move up.
Today I learned the silent majority doesn‚Äôt exist
Kamala Harris you‚Äôre corny.

Ah fuck! Wait markets shit's bed when he says market is doing good. Him throwing a tantrum may actually make market greener

Aged like fine organic milk
Who's on first?
Dude fuck you. Fucking cringe lord. 138k votes added to Biden without anyone getting a single one of those and you are speculating about whether or not I‚Äôm hot irl. Fuck you dry brain. Meat grinder candidate.
This is about the most true prediction I've seen here in the last 24 hours. Is there a volume index I can buy?
Nasdaq is climbing with each positive piece of news for Biden, big tech clearly was somewhat worried about Trump.
how can stonks grow if goy can't buy the new PS5
Everyone r fuk
It‚Äôs always been TAN
Idc if Biden wins, I only want Mitch McConnell out, that mf has to go. The senate has been doing nothing under rep control.

You think gun stock and renewables crashing and tech surging is a Biden price in? The market priced in a trump win. But Biden is back in it w MIchigan and Wisconsin swinging back blue. Could see a tech sell off.

Can we stop talking about the stimulus now?  It's not happening, nobody has anything to gain politically, they're all protected for 2-6 years now.  Everyone will forget about it by the next election cycle.
Always
Hello internet explorer

Edit: I agree though - die mango ü•≠
Very glad to see the senate still stay slightly Republican.

Absolute best case for the market is what‚Äôs playing out right now. Biden win, senate R, House D. Keeps liberal ideas in check, makes it so a stimulus will still be business friendly and there will definitely be at least 1-2 R senators looking to flip for stimulus.
[removed]
nah, or maybe for a slight dump

Trump not accepting the results is priced in, covid lockdowns is priced in, no stimulus is priced in, what else ?

This feels like a massive blow off top that's about to happen, but who knows. Wall Street is pricing in a blue victory based purely on the metrics available but is all this a result of that? I can't help but think that it's a smash and grab and then we drill till we have a definitive election result.

All I know right now is that I feel like a fucking donkey for not buying everything on Monday, sitting here on my VIX shares and SPY/QQQ puts that I bought yesterday around 10:30a which at the time seemed like it was the top for the day.
I‚Äôm afraid of this, but hey that‚Äôs what primaries are for I guess. For now we can all just be happy to hopefully be rid of orange man.

What are we thinkin? Next week maybe?
Take your gains, don‚Äôt be greedy!

Lol which charges? Nothing but smoke
Was over 3%
He won‚Äôt be charged cause he won another 4 years sorry loser
What a bunch of malarkey
Can market stability win the election please. I just want to go back to makin tendies
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇblew 28-3 lead
Still getting fucked
Was 3%+
So Biden gonna win??
My puts r fuk
Best case for the market though.
Nah I got leaps too lol kinda has been a safe investment over the past few months, made nasty money and still holding I want $50
Yeah he all but said he's just in for 1 term to return to some normalcy. Then its all out for both sides in 24

What r u talking about TSLA up bigly still
Congrats
Except he's gonna die in office and she'll take over
Stop getting your hopes up
Dump puts
he will buy pedo island and hide on there
Do you need a degree to work at the S&P500?
Buy more.
Cash gang actually feels good despite everything. I'm not stressing at all I think I'm gonna take my daughter to the park to play with our dog. See y'all after trump tanks the market
Imagine the history books, when they see that 1/3 of the country created a cult around a ü•≠.
Either candidate would be the oldest ever elected right?
[deleted]
Then it‚Äôs risky.
29k here
You can thank the supreme court's love of super pacs and unregulated social media for that
Still with the snap puts? This sub will never learn
If the calls are in tech keep them, anything else dump
Why is ICLN down if Biden is ‚Äúwinning‚Äù
If he suicides it will be because of his $400m margin call
[deleted]
It does appear so. It‚Äôs still very close but Bidens numbers changed a lot after they counted more cities
Should I dump my SPXS $6 11/20 calls
1-2 days, probably.
Tastyworms
And Wyoming doesn't deserve 1 vote let alone 2 Senators.  The systems the system.
Just fuck off and dump, im so sick of being wrong all the time, literally fuck off and dump already
[deleted]
See you Monday.
I've always thought dudes rocking a goofy stache was a sign of depression
Good movie

We could use a house of representing
I can‚Äôt believe i have DKNG FB calls and IWM UVXY puts
This smells like the stimulus...MM pump it up to green as fuck and then dump
Thanks Elon
Hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahah oh my god man that was so funny and creative and totally not the same rehashed joke regurgitated for the last year nd a half. 

Trump is 6months younger than joe Biden, you should probably think of a better joke.
Can we get a paper trading thread? Its been a while since we had one of those, and its been a while since a mod wrote a book about it.
Tag this shit TA!
I wonder if my 0DTE 330 puts have a chance
I'm buying spy puts at open and TLT calls.
4% NQ premarket is still pretty nuts.
Better off buying shares longterm, less scary but less money too. If not buy some 2021 leaps
NC, GA and PA are locks retard. Only coin flip is NV.
Flip a coin. I'd say 53/47 biden wins
i think the worry was a black swan event
You are calling vote counting fraudulent because it doesn‚Äôt support your candidate. You are an idiot.
Trump won‚Äôt be able to contest if he loses by more than 1 state.
The dip was last week shit bird
Yes my UVXY Puts are going to print !
These idiots can shop at walmart every week but can't vote. This reaks of fraud.
You guys watching the narrow leads in NV, WI and MI ? Do you think Trump gonna let it go ? I am famn sure he will sue for voter fraud or something if it's like 1% difference in any of those states
Imagine imagininginging
Look i love Michael Strahan but why is he discussing this election on my tv right now
It was a bot, you ugly
Wyoming doesn't deserve ~~2~~ 3 EV since a single vote there is worth more than a vote in Cali
Robinhood traders in shambles in 9 minutes
Maybe in the longer term. A republican senate will never approve a capital gains tax increase, so I think lack of stimulus will have more of an impact in the short term.
Be careful for the opening pump, I wouldn‚Äôt load up on puts right off the bat, buy 1 or 2 and see what kind of action or heck buy some calls and sell them once the initial pump stops
blue wave my ass said my bidet
Puts will print when Trump starts tweeting bullshit.
And if you‚Äôre not rich?
3rd party voters in swing states are cucks*
I'm waiting for...something
Biden on track to win NV, AZ, WI, MI, PA *and* GA. Incredible. A red mirage indeed!
Porkay?
Imagine if wsb actually invested instead of buying weeklies
No
Pretty much my reaction last night.
The math says otherwise retard. 213 (what he has) + above mentioned states = 270.
[deleted]
He won‚Äôt run for a second term imo - they‚Äôll switch him out for Kamala and she will lose it for the Dems because she is so unlikeable
I really don't know. That's going to be a hard decision. My gut says I should. nio I might hold because it's a meme stock at this point. Who knows how high it goes.
Large dump incoming.

Just bought calls yesterday
Yeah I would
10% or so
Hell yeah, but let me in first k? Smol dip at open
Idk whether to take profit on my calls and hope to break even on my puts or cut losses on my puts and hope to ride my calls. Either way I'm probably fucked.
200 EOY, suck a duck
Bond yields tho
We dont need 4 senators from the Dakota territories but ces la vie

Trump permabulls, having second thoughts about your bullshit?
Is this sarcasm?
Not so fast, MMs gonna let it fade to open now and pump YUGELY
Agree, BTurds
[deleted]
I am so fuk at open
What are the chances Trump suicides in the oval office rather than face all his charges in January?
Seems like 49D/51R is the best case scenario for Democrats at this point. 48D/52R might be more likely though.
I mean he literally said he would throw out ballots
which tickers you think are best positioned for gains here? i have some positions in acb but wondering if they are the ones to take advantage, as i think they have been bleeding cash even before covid.
What?? Up 5%
biden will take PA. It's majority mail-ins that haven't been counted yet and biden has so far gotten 80% of the mail-in ballots
Divided government=status quo

Uh no he didn‚Äôt. He won pa Michigan which is a done deal.
Elon only has a bachelor's degree...
Like FB.
All the boomers went to sleep thinking ü•≠ won are in for a big shock.
How you figure
I think president/house may be able to work out something
Ya, but see the leads there. Too narrow for trump to not call it fraud and sue
If Nevada and Michigan are blue then Biden has already won. He has 270
Nah you stfu
My boomer father uses them for stonk ideas and he's up like 80% in 18 months on shares alone. They're actually really useful if you aren't trying to time and game options
So Biden likely winning now and trump will contest? Puts will not bankrupt me?
You mock it but when you need tactical socks to save you from being kidnapped, you'll be sorry
Yep, im literally eating popcorn whilst reading

I got a message from this girl on snap saying I was Hot 

Calls on my self-esteem this morning
Not anymore.
People get too caught up in who wins president when the senate race is just as if not more important. I‚Äôm a Biden voter but if he wins and senate majority is republican, there‚Äôs no reason to celebrate.
Yo is this the streamer who lost everyone's money in 2008 first try?
I just want to get out and leave this circus. But down like 70%....

Yes, if Trump wins NV, GA,PA he wins

It‚Äôs funny how people think that if Trump loses he will be just GONE from the world...he will still be here, tweeting, meddling, shit talking...
It‚Äôs never too late to buy calls
But no cap gain tax increases 

Seems like a wash imo
He needed MI.
So do I hold my amd calls or sell
Cuz we are flat and we love IV crush after earnings event (look at snap IV crushed even when move was outside the expected move)

The right will disagree with you. Until Texas inevitably becomes blue/swing state.

Then they will instantly agree with you
It wasn't lmao he had Michigan and Wisconsin at the time
This will make me a couple monies...  But WTAF is going on?
They want Republican senate to stop any chance of tax hikes, Biden President to normalize international relations
it's clear Trump's changed US politics forever 

Democrats need to find their 'Trump'

If you want to live in an authoritarian country there are plenty of others to choose from but fuck off trying to make the US one
This is the best case scenario. No retarded bailouts for state run PERS. Doesn't murder the USD
Noooop shit.  I know a lot of organizations that are begging for scraps, and they actually do important things for people who need it
guess we didn't actually care about whether the election would be decided today
Michigan still has almost 1  million mail in votes to count, Nevada 200k.  This is still the third quarter.
its over biden will win with 270
Mail in fraud votes did it
Lol, there‚Äôs documented proof of both those things. 

They interested shipments of their hair dude, it‚Äôs just a simple fact. 

Nice fallacy btw, any moron can try to take a part of a discussing and argue just that. Fallacies are perfect instruments for bigotry.
Big if
SNAP too high imo
Probably because Biden would give even less funding to an already behind military because he wont be tough on China. Plus if he puts us in more lockdowns or air travel doesn't recover sooner, new jets definitely wont be purchased. 

That's my best guess.
Stonks go down because of election uncertainty last week.

Stonks go up because of election uncertainty this week.

Mofos just making up reasons for market movement, but we already knew that, right?
He‚Äôs right
He's up 12% lmao

What a fucking scam those sites were. I'm actually amazed and have mad respect that whoever ran those things probably made bank. Getting retards to all chip in together to pay many times more for an item than it's worth just in hopes one of them might get it cheaper.
investor optimism is a mental disorder
You can tell how retarded this sub is. Some idiot who thought Trump would win Michigan and Wisconsin like last night got 26 up votes on a post I made that gets downvoted since I used logic in how the remaining ballots would be counted.

Once Biden started winning suburban votes in states he had no business in being close in (Georgia and Texas), that translated super well to Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Biden will squeak pass in those states since the same white moms who voted for Trump in 2016 didn't vote for him in 2020.

Eh, longer term it is better.  Vaccine results are coming this month.  Stimulus might not even be needed, because it'll just add a ton more debt.
hmmm
Your buddy made a smart bet... if the democrats can't manufacture enough votes to steal the election. This is the most fraudulent election in US history, Counting only legitimate votes Trump won by a landslide, now the democrats are scared that they didn't commit enough fraud to ensure their senile-pedophile candidate wins so they are trying to manufacture more fake votes in the battleground states before counting can finish. 

I should have placed a prop bet on how long this election will be drug out.
He‚Äôs going to win Georgia too
I can‚Äôt wait to watch those idiots in their gi joe army gear

Mango really lost an election cause he couldnt help himself dissing a dead guy

Everyone forgets that the Great Depression played out over 3 years to reach ATL.

March was essentially a massive test and external shock likely compounded by QE and the death of bonds as an effective hedge. 

Black Thursday has yet to come, and this here could easily be the moment of truth where everyone realizes just how dumb the market is.

True, I think it was last night when he called it over. He definitely doesn‚Äôt want to call it now.
Hmm....

Biden presidency and red senate may be the best overall scenario.  It means better trade outlook because Biden will reverse Trump's protectionism.  A red senate will block Biden from increasing corporate taxes and capital gains taxes.

There is a direct correlation between intelligence and education. Statistically speaking you will be more successful with a degree, many companies don't even give you an interview without one. A degree may not make you more intelligent but an intelligent person knows the value of having one and the doors they open.

>explode down with Biden (since senate will still be republican). Biden with a republican senate means no stimulus because "fiscal responsibility." 

You all really overanalyze this stuff.  The reason market would go red with Biden is primarily due to his plan to increase capital gains tax.  Thus, investors/hedge funds/banks/etc. would have a brief period of time to sell investments for a profit under under the current capital gains tax structure before Biden takes office.

They were expecting him to blowout; the election is still up in the air: when certainty becomes uncertainty, stocks plummet.

Really, extremely bearish if likely the Dems don't get Senate. They won't pass anything and tank economy. Could get so damn ugly and even worse if China figures this currency shit out.

He‚Äôs still a smidge behind in MI, however, several dark blue districts still have a major percent of vote to count.

Would be really shocking if those didn‚Äôt sway michigan hard blue
The few calls I bought yesterday will stop my account from going into bankruptcy
Dems are massive favourites to win MI.. bet of $10 will yield just $3 return

Because those states haven't declared yet

You call this a dip? Good lord

No.
I wanna call in sick to trade all day. But im worried I‚Äôm gonna blow up my account.

But everyone already knows the stuff you're saying. And OP's post acknowledges mail in votes.

You do realize that this isn't /r/politics. There's no scoreboard for counting posts from both sides.

You're missing the whole point if you don't get that the really interesting and relevant turn of events is Trump the retard declaring himself the winner regardless of incoming votes.
I watch /es on my broker most people use investing com

Nope. Definitely still will have a stimmy most likely.

RKT to $30 before earnings
[deleted]
No it won't.  It's priced in.  We saw the major movement last week.  Hedge funds and institutes are now long heading into the holiday season.
Market always priced in a high likelihood of Biden win. It‚Äôs mooning cause most predicted republicans would lose the senate.  That‚Äôs the bigger surprise here and the market likes a red senate that will keep a check on Biden doing things like eliminating electoral college, packing Supreme Court, creating new states etc that were all on the table if the Dems got control of all 3 branches and could have resulted in actual civil war.
In b4 the pump.
Yeah that's true. You can't make money in the stock market unless someone is losing money. So if everyone is buying puts it's gonna go up.
Biden just took the lead in Michigan.

Brilliant idea.

You could become a billionaire in no timeüòÇüòÇ
On the other hand we could do it ourselves. Let's make a hivemind wsb hedge fund and just inverse our decisions.

Look at the big picture and don't give away your money.

The market is actually very rational right now.  The market is so rational it priced in a contested election and many days with no clear winner.  Now it looks like that isn't going to happen, so market going up.  Irrational would be if the market didn't take into account the possibility of a crazy contested election.

What's next?  Nobody knows, but I can guess based on the past.  Retail investors are going to jump in quickly in tech.  Then institutions are going to sell tech and invest in consumer staples (the boring non meme stocks this sub hates) while selling you calls and puts in tech stocks that will expire worthless and they will keep the premium.

it's because we're certainly going to get a president. markets love certainty.
If the electoral college was tied and it went to the house Trump would win, each state delegation gets one vote and a majority of those delegations are republican-controlled. And the Senate would elect the VP, which would be Pence.

Sheer luck, change my mind and do 10 predictions in a row and i will call you 'sensei'

Why is this news. Billionaires get richer under every president
we are headed towards Biden with a red senate, if you buy calls at open youre so so stupid
Which ones you eyeing?
Do it
He can‚Äôt stop democracy
Still going to be a big package.üòé
But 100 more at the current price and sell another covered call at like $125.  Win-win.
think its their favored scenario due to limited policy changes/regulation etc.. not sure how stimulus plays in though
This. Edit: exactly why I‚Äôm taking profits at 9.

Biden is a centrist who will work with the right
Nothing over yet, just sit back and relax
He dismantled the pandemic team Obama started. We had people in China monitoring for potential risks and he pulled them out. This could have increased our response time. Too little response too late.
Puts at open?
Enlightened democracy? Oh brother get out of the basement. Look at a map without state borders, almost every district in the country went red. We don't need cities deciding every election.
Except his base only hates masks because he told them too. If he came out saying wear a mask from day 1, his base would be pro-mask

what is the VIX doing?
Hahaha take this L you trump tards.
Could play out well. However i must ask, which SPY price, pre-market has been allover the graph:P Near closing price?
I think he gets them. The 260,000 that are NPA most likely voted by mail due to worrying about the coronavirus. 

If they‚Äôre worried, they‚Äôre most likely leaning Biden 60-70%.

That gets him right around 70%.
Hum solar all dead but Biden still has a good chance to win. What‚Äôs going on
Doesn't the amount of bull dick in here over the last few days mean to inverse them as well?

My AAPL shares are in danger
All of the posts here almost convinced me to sell all of my shares. Thank god I did not do that. I bought some puts to hedge my position though, which in retrospect looks bad, however nothing will surprise me anymore and wsb is saying to expect a bull week, so it is very probable that the market could tank in the coming days.
Why not? Biden voters are

Yeah, probably. He should‚Äôve just let the doctors talk and he never talk except to introduce the doctors. Turning your back on science and trying to fake optimism was a hugely bad move. Unfortunately my fellow Americans are basically literally retarded and believe conspiracy theories over doctors.

What more likely is that federal government will give states even more say in the matter. Basically relax enforcement slowly to avoid agitating the grandma's and grandpas of the country. Then by the time all the old shits die off it will be a nothing burger when it is legalized federally.

Damn wish I put more money on Biden when odds were like +330
What's the play
Fuck it DKNG calls
Honestly, a very slim Dem minority in the senate is the best case scenario for the market. Keeps democrats more liberal ideas in check and makes it so republicans have to be wooed for votes.

Stimulus definitely passing in that scenario. No way 1-2 R senators don‚Äôt want it.

Basically the same, but my broker, Webull, doesn't have official spreads yet.

You can create the same trades, but it's really sucks lol.

They said spreads are coming in November, so I'll wait and see. I get a deposit incentive if I leave my deposited cash in Webull until like the 11th so they have until probably the end of the month before I start moving my money to think or swim.

Another way of looking at it is just a stronger correction than 2018.

I'll admit I'm talking with the benefit of hindsight, never would I have expected to reach new ATHs with this shit. But what it truly means is that there never was a real bear market, the bull market just got that much more stupid.

Add a few indicators to the mix.

Check Bollinger Bands across multiple time frames.

Also try STDV since everything usually returns to the mean.

2 more easy ones to add and understand are TSI and RSI.

Add them together and you have a much more informed picture that you can add the candlestick patterns to and give yourself a higher probability of success.
[removed]
All face ripper rally and downhill afterwards
I don't think so because we still don't know the winner
So what do we do?
Not during the speech they showed on ABC. Maybe they cut early? Either way it‚Äôs scummy and misleading news
Damn when did that happen, went to bed at midnight last night and Trump was doing well in Michigan. It‚Äôs these mail in ballots isn‚Äôt it??
good point . thanks
Trump calling himself the winner last night reminds me of everytime he tweets about the stock market
Damn everything is up huge.  Treasuries, metal, and of course every stock.  Even DraftKings is going back to the moon!
I realize this is cliche as fuck but the market tends to be ahead of the curve by a couple of days unless it‚Äôs truly unprecedented events.

The market was pricing a blue wave last week based on polls.

Futures were going nuts over essentially status quo last night with blue house and red senate with Trump.

As of right now we have a Biden pres, blue house and red senate which was not priced in and we‚Äôre seeing that now.

It would mean good things for tech, a slightly tempering of expectations on clean energy and weed, no changes in corporate taxes and probably a middle of the pack stimmy next year
So you‚Äôre saying that 50% of folks are absolute dumbfucks who can‚Äôt come up with a correct prediction even when the answer is obvious, and staring them right in their dumb fucking faces?

Well, I think that 50% figure is far too low sir
Now you‚Äôll pay even less in taxes. No need to worry about Biden lol
I got burned holding too long after it decided to dump 50%. The iv is so crazy even for weekly super otm. Been getting into xpeng. No weeklies but I did buy some 11/20 25c that are looking nice this morning
Fuck your puts
>My thinking was this: if Tesla is currently trading high, then ARKK would be trading high

1) Likely, but not entirely due to Tesla, because Tesla is only a percentage of that portfolio. 

Basically ARKK is letting you (really us retail investors) invest in numerous (33-55) "innovative" companies without having to pay 7 figures.  

2) Who knows what "high" is for Tesla.  However I learned my lesson years ago when I thought $35 was to high and so I waited.

3) Buy and then keep it and don't panic sell.  If [xxxx] is elected and tech and Tesla go down, then wait (or buy more).

4) If you want to gamble/day trade/etc. set aside 5-10% of an account.  Or ideally put that 5-10% in a separate gambling account.  Don't mix investing and gambling.  Or do, but that's a lesson that hurts really bad to learn the hard way.
soups in campbells
Correct, either he wins or he doesn‚Äôt. Seriously though, Biden is big favourite.
spy 350 today?
Because Republicans took the Senate.  So no matter who wins, we have divided government, which is good, because when government can't do shit, they can't mess stuff up.
no gap up today i called that last night.

Same, I didn‚Äôt think uncertainty was this fucking bullish

Na well trump won pa Michigan so it‚Äôs literally over they just milking it cause dems are cheating.

Nobody in WSB cares about facts and results, we all care about implications & expectations.

I'd could've lost thousands already by holding a Trump call which gets IV crushed.
Wonder how that impacts Senate?
Speculation but coming from sources that are involved in the committee that oversee these type of rulings

What‚Äôs the next play if you‚Äôre trump other than taking it to the Supreme Court? Red mirage, ‚Äòballot fraud‚Äô, -> conservative majority on the Supreme Court.

I‚Äôm not making a prediction on the outcome, but they‚Äôre legit votes that will gross to un-count. I think we‚Äôll see this happen faster than bush v gore in 2000. It likely won‚Äôt take longer than a week or so he‚Äôll have to make his move before the weekend.

How much did these billionaires get richer during Obama presidency? Economy is growing people get richer. Somehow media thinks losing money is a good thing. Maybe they‚Äôre one of us!
Of course, what the fuck do you expect? That Trump would magically be better for the economy?

It's pricing it that it wasn't a total shitshow
PA was always going to look heavy R today. Now we have a lot of mail in ballots to count that are majorly for Biden. 

Easily could flip as the week goes on.
Why did they actually stop counting anyway? As soon as they did, yesterday night, Gwinnett county said ‚Äúoh turns out we have a few million more‚Äù cause of some issue in the absentee computer. Seems like they really are gonna fondle the counts to have Biden win
Bears occupied getting their mouths ready to taste warm ass hole after being obliterated by the might green bull cocks.

Congrats man! That's some good shit!
TSLA 500 today
With a Republican senate if Biden wins? Good luck with that
Nope holding. Won‚Äôt crash today
If your up big just sell it and roll it over to a cheaper call if you're still bullish.
Lmao Gotta give yourself 3 times as much time on your options as you expect to be in trade. If i expect a quick move I buy options 3 weeks out. We never have exact timing.

No you were too busy posting things like "Cash gang" and "cash gangüçª" to pay attention and buy the dip
Baba bulls yall dipping in AM or holding
Yo dawg I heard you need to buy me a lambo
this aged well
Trump flat out told his supporters not to use mail-in, so that‚Äôs what happens?
Will the bull market last forever in your opinion? Or maybe at some point people who predict the flip will print?

Maybe it isn't now, maybe. But when markets detach from any semblance of reality it's a sure sign that the drop is close.

March was not a true crash. For one, retail mania only started after that.

If trump can hold Michigan we won but I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs possible with so many mail in democrat votes to be counted. Biden‚Äôs best path is through Michigan, Michigan Nevada and Wisconsin put him at 270. If trump takes any one of those states goodnight sleepy, the people saying Biden can take GA, NC, or PA are smoking the same shit as hunter biden
They took VIX out the back and put him down. He was a good boy :(

That tends to happen when your income increases and you take on more responsibility. I believe high income earning democrats are actually way more conservative than their base, so basically they transform into NIMBYs.

yeah, trump would need 60% of the remaining votes to tie it. seems very unlikely

bIDen WIn MaRKEts gOinG to tANk. No autists. Blue Houses with Red Senate is actually the preferred outcome of the market. No corporate taxes, no tech bust ups, China relationship chills out, no crazy New Green Deal, no wealth tax, no erratic tweeting and other unhinged presidential behavior, no blue house + blue senate big  spending and big disruptive changes to the status quo. Stimmy deal also a good chance of getting done out of the bright lights of the election.

Interesting. Is that official or speculation?

Yeah, without the Ant IPO, BABA is still trading about $100 lower than it should be.
Investors are seeing tech as a safe haven similar to what we saw during the pandemic with Nasdaq outpacing all other indices. Nasdaq rally > leading to market uplift but DXY has been telling a different story during US market yesterday. Should be interesting to see what happens this week
PA is only 65% counted with mostly mail in ballots missing. 
This makes this lead most likely the opposite.

We were telling you bears to buy the f'ing dip on Friday, but you chose to revel in your ignorance.
Easiest play is Straddles for next week's exp or nov 20 exp and sell 0dte against it to pocket all the premium. Eventually your long term position will be free and you pocket the free tendies when the market moons or tanks.

I can say they aren‚Äôt that great to work with anecdotally. They take way too long to do anything and I had one bid on a house fall through when it was brought up my pre-approval is through rocket. Realtors don‚Äôt like using them because it makes the buying process take way longer than if you go with a local bank.
Trump predicted this would happen
I told everyone in the office this morning I'd bet 45\* won. I still think he will. America is just that fucked up with this evangelical shit.
Wait WHAT. Shipment is back? I haven‚Äôt gotten on since like season 6. How‚Äôs the new cod looking like btw

Because he declared premature victory. Market bounced from lows at soon as he did it. I really think expectation and reality is gonna set in during the trading day.

No. The other choice is actively dividing and increasing given hate in our population, you have to agree to that.
If you don't do that you're automatically a better choice.

US is #2 in carbon emissions with very high per capita values. An alliance with EU could get us further as we then don't have disadvantages in competition if everyone has to follow the rules.
Buy 2 mins after open.
Lmao actually insane the luck with my plays. I have one small call position, and one small put position right now. The put position ticker is green, and the call position ticker is red. Only me ü§°ü§°

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again.
Yep and sadly they won it again.

Bro the dem voters were told to vote against Trump by the media.
If you bought puts instead of buying the dip. Congratulations, you played yourself.

The market is going to shit the bed if the decision who is president drags in to next week much.

It sounds like congress will continue to be split so the market also likes it when congress has no clear mandate so it can only do wildly popular projects like infrastructure spending and another round of some minimalist stimulus.

No. Tech is mooning because democrats didn't sweep. Specifically even if Biden wins the presidency, which is likely, the Senate remained in Republican control. Tech was worried of the "Blue Wave" and anti-trust lawsuits galore being shoved up their asses.

Lol see this is why I think you are an autist. Look at Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, etc and say what voting red does for you.
Closing all calls for a quick gain and will hold cash.  not gonna fall for this one.  biden might eek this out, and the Senate is definitely red.  The markets will take a shit if that happens, because it basically means no stimulus and an assload of gridlock for the next 4 years.   

Lawsuits and contention are coming as well.  Worse case scenario is starting to play out.

Lmao this is gonna be a fucking shitshow. Mango is gonna take this to court and the country is gonna be up in flames. Congress is gonna be split red & blue and nothing is gonna get done.

Anyway, nasdaq to 15k.
Dems likely to gain 1 seat in Georgia on a runoff election, 1 seat in Michigan, and 1 seat in Arizona. That puts them at 49. If they gain Maine, that puts them at 50. There is almost 0 chance they get majority unless they somehow pulled 2 seats out of Georgia which is unlikely. 

Republicans are locked in NC, locked for at least 1 seat in Georgia, if they win Maine, they're at 51. If they lose Maine, they're at 50. 

I don't know what you're looking at to think that 50/50 or 49/51 is unlikely.
Why tho :( reassure me please, I‚Äôm scared AF with that republican senate

None of this even makes sense. This is not 2001. We had a crash in March. Valuations and companies are not the same. The Fed will not lower interest rates for years.

What happens next is China continues its rise to power, this result is great for them.  Maybe another war in 4 years? heating tension with Russia and NK? Stimulus is probably fucked etc...

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again.

Biden win with republican senate. That means friendly to China and no tax raises. Best of both worlds for tech

NIO is either going to tank or moon more on open. Nothing in between. Probably moon given the current mood.
I was going to dollar cost average the way up but I got fomo and went in premarket
Good. He encouraged people to kidnap their governor
It‚Äôs over 20
Me telling someone about Trevor Noah mentioning blowing Florida off the map. I then say "We probably shouldn't go around saying we want to to destroy those that think differently." They responded with, "The other side would probably say the same thing if the results were reversed." as if that makes it ok.

How the fuck did we get to a place where it's ok to do it because they other side would probably also do it if they could.  Is there no sense of common decency? How about this? How about both sides are wrong? You shouldn't threaten to get rid of a state no matter how they vote.

Fuckin' A.
Who will win? The people who FOMO at open or the people taking profits?

I was the little girl on that bus. And the bus drivers name? Joe Biden
Yes you retard some of us want to live in a world that is in such a shape you actually can get kids without being so ashamed to leave behind a climate crisis for them.

Not counting the rising division, inequality and hate.
Bullish lol

***US ADP National Employment (Oct) 365k vs. Exp. 650k (Prev. 749k, Rev. 753k)***

Same. Selling all calls and holding the 2 336 SPY puts that will either print or expire worthless EOD
Some of those on r/politics are actually convinced US is 3rd world. Damn, they really don't know how good they have it...
Why do you have to bum me out like this

Add on that Nevada has all the postal votes to go. They are claiming it now.
I feel like the only thing that could tank this market right now is an instant global mass extinction event like an asteroid, yellow stone caldera, viru--ahaha what the FUCK am I saying??? The market would blast to ATH. FUCK ME and FUCK MY MONEY

Without any doubt
This is going to be a very stinky next two months
The remaining uncertainty doesn‚Äôt matter. House and Senate are split so no crazy policy changes will happen
ehh best hold that thought to eod, not premarket haha
Biden: AZ, NV, WI

Trump: AK (obviously), PA, GA, NC

MI should go to Biden with Mail ballots
Guys I‚Äôm really happy the market is pumping if not just because that extremely gay bear tried to point out ‚Äúthe double top so beautiful it looked like daVinci panted it‚Äù 

Get fucked

Senate does not look 50/50 at all, idk where you got that notion from lol
Considering it myself
For sure.
They are as retarded as the retards in r/politics
Out off the states Biden is trailing, he only needs Michigan and Trump has a tiny lead with a ton of mail ballots left to count.
You too?  I picked up ZM and DKNG last week.  I was down, now I am up with crazy momentum.
Good for you man, cherish the moments !!
Why is the Pennsylvania city commissioner in an empty counting center ffs get your counters out of bed and give them some adderall

Hey hey hey why don‚Äôt you fuck off with your radical ideas pal
There‚Äôs no sell off if Joe ole boi wins
Then the question becomes what defines exceptional ability to Elon. Knowing him it probably means you have to have created an electric car in your basement or something. It's probably easier to just get a degree and apply instead of being "exceptional" in his eyes.
Yeah PA goes to trump but MI goes to Biden most likely
A couple of states may end up within the margin of fraud...
republican senate, so there won't be any radical changes
\> We‚Äôre all smart here 

The fact that you derived equivalence from implication is proof that not all...
it is truly insane. and the thing is it isn't even people thinking they're picking the lesser of two evils anymore like they were in 2016, people *love* trump. very much a cult it's creepy

Probably if you take into account how long they dragged out florida when it was known for a while before they actually admitted it. This shit is crazy.
It‚Äôs all about uncertainty: events with uncertain outcomes drive markets down, but now we are certain that the outcome is uncertain so the markets are rebounding.

That‚Äôs bullshit. Check the numbers. Mostly Mail ballots left. Should be a Biden win
Priced in
AAPL needs to do a split to finally break 125
So is this tighter than Bush vs ~~ManBearPig~~ Gore
Pretty confident here that the market closes flat. Pattern is literally the opposite of 2016. Trump already set up ground work to contest Biden if Biden wins, it's already going to be a close victory for either candidate. 

Sorta worst case scenario here. Unclear winner, senate looks like will be 50/50 or 49/51 Republicans. Lot's of uncertainty. 

Trump victory means we get a possible rubber stamp for stimulus, at the same time, senate has fail to deliver so it's unlikely we get stimulus until Jan or Feb. FEDs gonna come out and say the same thing. "We have the ability to keep everything afloat, but we need stimulus"

I mean market has already shown that it can sell off and wipe the entire gain last night. Definitely think reality is going to set in when market opens. Honestly, I could see this week closing out flat. Really burn all the IV and dick down option buyers. If you're buying puts or calls, I wouldn't fuck with 0dte or this week's exp. I'd probably buy next week exp and sell the 0dte against it to pocket the premium.

One thing I always tell myself, "never underestimate the stupidity of the average American"

Yeah, sitting it out was defo better than going all-in on bearishness.... it's just the regret management is a skill i'm still working on.
People who think the market is rigged have "quantum stabilized atom mirror‚Äù level smooth brains. It absolutely is rigged: over time stocks rise. 

Maybe don‚Äôt try to day trade $1,000 based on moves you read about here two weeks late on WSB against people who trade millions a day and don‚Äôt need to sell their  poke-mon card collection if there is a margin call.

Strawberry milk is superior. Don‚Äôt burn me at the stake.
How are futures green when this shit election is absolutely going to drag out and involve the courts and a lot of presidential threats and possible constitutional crisis? I thought the market hated uncertainty?
I read this as apex-level reading skills
which is why i wanna buy calls


the market is treating this like it won‚Äôt be contested 


but trump will prolly contest this no matter the margins

Nah dude Biden is like 10k away from leading Michigan. He maintains that, he wins
The fact that we still have to " count " our votes like mammoth charging neanderthals in the year 2020 says so much for Amaerica.  That said....why did i sell my amd stocks before election.  Fuck.

No it isn‚Äôt. Biden is about to swing Michigan, he holds Wisconsin and Nevada and he won. Trump is up less then 10k votes in mi. There‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of mail ins to count. It‚Äôs over.
When the fuck will the next state be decided already
Just like when he brags about The s&p
Michigan can‚Äôt even fucking get drinkable water right.

I made a similar bet with Biden and dude was talking cash shii last night. Now he's radio silent.
That's not a big drop. The current configuration of the market makes it literally impossible that a drop will end at that.

Look at a zoomed out SPX/NDX weekly chart. Then zoom in a bit and look at the NDX chart in 2001.

It's just that this particular brand of mental retardation is being spearheaded by the Fed. Once Trump/Biden wins they won't need to/want to prop markets up.

The logical move is to let the bubble blow off steam.
Just thought it was kinda weird she texted it. She could have just rolled over and said it to me
Guys I think I know why the market is up.

If Trump had lost: supporters would have rioted and burned some stuff

If Biden had lost: supported would have rioted and burned some stuff

Since no one lost, there was no stuff burned. Therefore businesses are saved. So long as no one ever wins, they market should go up infinitely.
Supreme Court here we come!!!
What democrats achieved: they can feel good on the inside that the new  president isn't a meany and finally some black pussy in the White House

Why none of this matters: Republicans keep senate so Mitch will stonewall any meaningful legislative policy. No tax increase, no healthcare reform, etc.  He does have some control over foreign policy and environmental  regulations so expect Chinese and energy stocks to boom. Could also order DEA to reschedule Marijuana
Mango Jinxed it.
Trumps up too big. It‚Äôs pretty much a wrap
We should know by tonight.
Because money went in, not out of the system
That‚Äôs ridiculous

you son of a bitch im in
I'm not expecting an big dip to be honest. Feeling way too much FOMO in here right now. Could be wrong though.
I believe you‚Äôll care about but only because you don‚Äôt understand it
What effect will everyone selling their puts/hedges at open have on market ??
She wrong?
I expect 

Biden: AZ, NV, WI

Trump: AK (obviously), PA, GA, NC

Meaning MI decides. Looks like it‚Äôs only Mail ballots left so it should go to Biden but it‚Äôs not a given.
If Biden gets it he wins 270-268
Just doesnt feel right for some reason. I'm not complaining though.
At open... very curious about the intraday
such a fukking anti-climax
Put it all in GameStop shares and retire in January

Exactly. It really makes a ton of sense really
Don't worry bears, in an alternate universe the market is currently limit down due to uncertainty. But not in this timeline
Because Trump still has the upper hand
So did I and I‚Äôm for Biden, and it still looks like trump is gonna win

He‚Äôs the type to ignore stocks or anything related to investing for long periods of time and then have someone remind him several years later.

I wish I had that sort of oblivious outlook. Might actually be positive lmao
Since tech puts at open makes too much sense, tech calls it is.

Another dumb zm pump. Puts will print again. Two weeks straight
This is the perfect metaphor for trading these last 2 weeks.
Me too but it looks bad
It also means so extra taxes for the rich, you know, the ones with money in the market
If you suck the üåà üêª dick, you better be ready to get jizzed on. Feels bad for all you bulls who switched sides.

Markets love democracy I see. Can we have another election next week?
I paper handed mine last week üòî
That's just factually not true. Many of the founders espoused over and over again the virtue of democracy in letters to each other and other colleagues. There were fears, but overall the sentiment was radically pro democracy in contrast to the government systems in the Western world at the time.

Conversely most of the European ruling class legitimately thought the US would fall in just a few short years or decades at the most as they saw its radical democracy as being untenable - a strong country needed a king. Arguably it was even part of the rationale as to why Britain gave up so easily on reconquering the US - the prevailing thought was that the US would collapse under democracy and then beg Britain to take it back or otherwise be easy to re-take. Why waste men on a war today when the opponent will fold tomorrow?
Do it like I do. Sell covered calls on your shares to hedge a bit against a downturn... and then panic and buy them back at a loss as NIO rises
I‚Äôm going to be honest. One of the many reasons I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump is because I wanted to see him give a concession speech.

Yeah I think they can‚Äôt afford to not pass something. But yeah they‚Äôll def have to get through grim reaper Mitch
I‚Äôm independent and really want Biden to win. Yeah trump is entertaining but when I think about my family and the future it‚Äôs a no brainer. If the republican candidate was a stand up classy guy like a jerome Powell type demeanor, I would vote republican
You rang?
I did this too on my FD account lmao.
Kiss stimulus goodbye forever. Dems won the presidency and lost the senate, absolute worse case scenario. Way to fucking go lmao. Hope y‚Äôall got cash, March lows gonna look overvalued soon.

Guess there is a lot of trump support on this sub because it‚Äôs filled with white male college dropouts
Divided executive branch + senate + house = no stimmy or very small stimmy.

Why is this shit up?
If there is a literal tie, each state will get 1 vote as to who is elected,, majority wins. Meaning Trump wins since more states are red in the house of representatives.
Lmaooooo I laughed at loud and woke up my girlfriend. Thanks for putting me in the dog house you autist.

Trump win is definitely not priced in. Look at all the betting markets already.
Just woke up, so Im guessing that contested elections and divided governments are bullish.
Trump declaring victory early is the modern equivalent Truman holding up the newspaper. 

Even though Truman won in that scenario.

Sorry
We'll see. I don't see him taking up any bill he hasn't negotiated and now he likely won't have a Trump directive telling him to take up the $1.8t number. The Senate is what has been capping the number. Dems will see the presidency flip as a mandate to push their policies pushing their numbers up, so I just see a bunch of gridlock. Map isn't too favorable for Rs in 2022 though so maybe that affects things.

At least you have access to education to become software engineers. I‚Äôd take that and they pay cut over knowing if I screw up my retirement ‚Äúsavings‚Äù I‚Äôll be homeless when I‚Äôm 60 (if not before). I live in Canada and while I at least won‚Äôt go into crippling debt over medical bills (except maybe in prescriptions and dental), student debt is still crazy and very few non-public jobs offer pensions and the ones that do often lay their employees off before they have to pay it. Add to that soaring housing prices (which were already unaffordable) and the fact that a majority of people under 30 live paycheque to paycheque and it‚Äôs not looking like that‚Äôs going to change any time soon, we‚Äôre pretty much fucked
Dozens, literally dozens
Nah. With our current system voting third party is dumb unless you're just doing a protest vote and don't give a fuck who wins. The only way for viable third parties is to switch to something like ranked choice voting. If you really don't like the candidates, you need to vote in the primaries, which way too many people don't do

you give his base more credit than i do. i think most of the trump cultists will remain the ignorant assholes they are.

Well, in South Africa we have a majority rules type of 'democracy' which directly discriminates against minorities as a result.

market open by easter
Looks pretty obvious Biden will win at this point but Republicans will hold the senate and made gains in house.  This is worst case scenario for stonks to go up :(
The idea behind voting for a third party is not to win but to get them to 5%, so they could at least be allowed on the debate stage for the next election. I don‚Äôt think anyone is delusional enough to think that a third party is winning the presidency
The UVXY calls I got right at close... üòû
I think shitting on people‚Äôs political views in general is a huge problem. So contentious. Everyone comes from someplace different
Your wish is my command
Smart money looks at the data and the data is quite favorable for Biden right now. Absentee and provisional ballots trend to be very blue, so from this point on Trump will likely only lose ground. His lead in MI has already basically evaporated, which is the final piece.
The seats that were potentially going to flip have been called and Dems lost a few non battleground states that they thought were safe. Dems will not likely have a majority in the senate when this thing is called.

Sold my googl weeklies around 2 yesterday.
I would think they contribute somewhat to uncertainty. I know the result is unlikely to change and I guess the market is pricing that in.  

I've been enjoying these unreasonably high call premiums. =)
It's over him
I don't even know what he's trying to short? Like, this thing is strategically designed to only go up in the short, mid and long term and permabear wants to buy puts with stimulus on the books

Yep exactly.....Europe locked down just for our benefit
don't understand, trump is parading as if he won, says he will go to the supreme court to stop vote counting, but the market is mooning?
You can use this:

https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/

Or for a back of the napkin guess you take

(Delta) x (price change of underlying) x 100 + (theta, which itself is negative) x 100 + (option‚Äôs last $ price)

So if your 1 call option was worth $300 at close, delta at 0.5, theta at -0.2, and stock moved from $80 to $85:

0.5 x $5 x 100 + -0.2 x 100 + 300 = ~$530

It's going to be very close but it's not looking good for Trump overall. This doesn't even account if Biden steals GA
Big stimulus when? February? Still going to have a Republican Senate so don't know what stimulus you think they are passing.
Legally there's no standing. States can choose electors however they want, so long as they follow their own laws. The recount was a grey area which is why it could be contested.

Every media outlet has collectively gathered and bent over the bears in what could be the greatest lie of all time

"I'm so scared, if it's a contested election, it's very bearish and stonks could go down 20%!"

"A contested election is the most bearish case possible, expect a sharp decline in the market"

"Be wary, if the election is contested it could really drive the market down further"

Election is already contested by Trump going to the SCOTUS. Markets: StOnKs Go Up!!1!!

Trump is going to lose so what's going to happen to his cult?
I stepped down as store manager Oct 3. Last paycheck I still got my old pay. When I brought it up with my dm he told me that all of the Van Drivers(position i am now) got a raise and they were leaving me at my old pay rate. Just checked my current paycheck and I'm getting paid what van drivers were getting paid before( 8 dollars less than my old rate. 3 dollars less than van drivers new rate)

How should I handle this WSB? Key points to keep in mind: this a 3 month old acquisition so besides me, there are about 3 people who actually knows whats going on between the 3 stores I help out. I manage the vans and nobody else knows or even wants to know how to. I plan on leaving soon anyway.

Should I just turn this bitch upside down now?

Edit: I feel this is getting down voted for being more than 10 words.

Markets sold off on uncertain/contested election

and are now rallying once the worst fear has been realized

this seems very similar to the march crash, where we dropped 40% and then once the "worst recession ever" happened we began rallying since it was no longer uncertain that we were fukked

If Biden wins but he has no power to pass anything big like tax increases, green new fantasies, etc.  the rules of the game are what they are today. 
 Stimulus is coming no matter what and the market has factored that in.  

The market sees a path for the economy continuing to improve.  It looks 6 to 12 months out and if taxes are not going up, companies continue to buy back stock, companies benefit from low rates and the party continues.

I don't even have it in me to make an argumentative comment to this anymore.
I think a shit ton of people initially underestimated the significance  of absentee ballots this election because of the unprecedented amount this election.

Basically, Biden activated the mirror force trap card on Trump.
Biden winning isn‚Äôt as bearish as you guys think it is ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Especially short term
My guy, in Arizona 80%+ of all voters vote by mail. It has been done that way for decades in my state. We count our ballots as we receive them when returned which is why you see Arizona report nearly all of its votes the moment the polls close because barely no one goes the polls. Its way more convenient and you can actually take your time researching all of the 50 different things on the ballot besides just president to make a good decision. 

Our votes are some of the fastest reported in the country and all have paper ballots serialized ballots so they can't be fucked with. It is basically the most accurate, secure and fastest reporting way to do it. Normally we would report well over 90% right away and have an instant call, but the whole "don't trust the mail system" caused a lot more ballots to end up in drop boxes in the day of and day before election day so they had to be collected and processed.
Even if Biden wins the remainder of ballots by like 80% I think trump can irk a PA win. 

Honestly though I‚Äôm more worried about stimulus money for the stocks. The senate is looking like it will still be majority republican. So Mitch mcconnel is goin to keep cucking us
If it‚Äôs 49-51 the dems would only need one defection which with out trump to ridicule them might be more possible
Bovada has Biden -400 Trump +280, I thought the race was closer than this from everything I'm hearing?

I have quite a few calls but this is not what I was expecting this morning.   I am expecting this to plummet at open though as per usual.

Everyone who is saying ‚ÄúI tHOght nO rEsuLts bAd?‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt realize the Senate results are in and the Reps will continue to hold this. This is a solid bulwark against any overly progressive policies that could be bad for business. So it absolutely makes sense the market is reacting well.

Prob after hours or pre market
2000 was for the ‚Äúrecount‚Äù not a the first count, trump don‚Äôt have a legal leg to stand on
I‚Äôm not understanding the optimism in the market right now.  The republican are keeping the senate = not much stim.  Put Biden in office, and I think the dynamic is even worse for equities.  It‚Äôs shaping up worse case scenario
At this point it is. Mail in heavily favors Biden and in person counting is done.

Now it's a question of how big of a lead Biden scrapes back from D's who didn't want to vote in person - but increasingly likely given that the only state still a toss-up in that list is MI, which is neck and neck and only 90% reporting according to WSJ.
Yeah I ended up buying back in after watching it continually climb.
My calls certainly hope so
I think it would be funny if trumpers were to go on a "Not my president" campaign. I think seeing their tears would be so much more satisfying than the liberal tears since they were so much more enthusiastic.
If you buy now you may end up down next week or so, but ultimately I think you will profit off of an investment in NIO. Buy leaps with long expiry.

I don't know about PA but WI looks locked up easily and MI is definitely trending his way. Even Vegas flipped and heavily predicts Biden. Going to sleep it seemed like Trump had a chance. Good to see not only he lost but will look foolish having declared victory way too early.

Idk I essentially bet on civil unrest but it looks like they‚Äôve got the social media platforms on a tighter leash than normal

Thanks, it's confusing will all kinds of different betting systems.

Bet $100 on Biden and win $128 total e.g.
He is worshipped in AZ.
^^^^^^ THIS ^^^^^^. A large move to fiscal stimulus is extremely bearish in the long run for equities imo.  As the government moves from monetary to fiscal stimulus it will gradually erode Fed support.  Also large fiscal stimulus could force the Fed to raise rates which would be Armageddon üòÇ

It's not because Trump, then Biden, then Trump, then Biden was leading. It's not because Trump tried to shut down the ballot counting and steal the election. 

No one knows wtf is flying right now. Everything is up, whether it benefits from a Trump win or a Biden win.

Communism with no government - e.g. the people literally self govern as a commune - polar opposites.  This has never occurred.

It's done in other countries. So yes, if your first choice doesn't get majority it automatically gives your vote to your 2nd choice and if they don't get majority to your 3rd choice and so on. Basically everyone could vote for anyone they wanted without fear of giving an advantage to a candidate you would not want to win.

In most elections people vote more about blocking the other side more than being in love with the candidate they voted for.
Guh. Kiss those shares goodbye.

Last election didn't have mail in ballots on this level yet to be counted. Though I expect a majority of those to go to Biden. Trump is proper doomed. I don't even know how this was close TBH.

NIO has done more for my account than any other stock in the history of this country. It really is amazing.
It‚Äôs actually crazy

You're not getting any more than $500b from a republican senate who only wants to torpedo a Biden presidency, and that's generous
People be forgetting the real trigger that cost Donny the election: the m'fin Borat sequel

Well played SBC
Will take a while for everything, but I expect there will be a clear winner by this evening. PA will take the longest, but it won't be needed to know the final result.
-360 is bet $360 to win $100.
Current odds
Biden $1.27
Trump $4.5

That‚Äôs why
He made the Trump voters fall asleep
Aight so now we're mooning on a near-certain Biden win, so that was a lie
Did CNN just say NV is giving an update tomm?

Well I mean the US presidential election is the single biggest betting event in the world.
So if Biden takes Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada, it's pretty much game over

Then Pennsylvania, Georgia and NC can do whatever the fuck they want
ER on the 17th, maybe do the 20th
I really thought it was the right move, being cash gang this week...
I'm old enough to remember yesterday when no result by morning was bad for markets.
You‚Äôll see man, calling it now. Major dips
They seperate people according to race and treat each group differently because reasons
Remember Joe as POTUS and Senate kept by Mitch is the worst case scenario of this result for market. To add to that shitshow you have Donald in office for at least a month till Biden is sworn in. Only thing worse than this is contested election. And as I see NV, MI and WI numbers are looking extremely unclear. 


Markets can stay retarded for a while and keep mooning, but I don't see it lasting any longer.
Where are you flying from?
Trump is def pumped up on coke and meth rn while Biden is probably already on his second 18 hour nap of the day already.
Last election MANGO took a lead in night and this time it is BIDEN
Detroit only 64% in compared to 90+% in every other county in MI.

That‚Äôs probably just majority Biden we can assume mail in ballots.

MI for Biden most likely. Way too close for Trump to maintain a gap with only 30% margin in Detroit.
Shambles and bears. Name a better couple !
Coping lmao
Do you see this shit dropping though? Shit is mooning

My puts killin me
Why would a biden win not make sense for a strong market

I dunno. I feel a good chance the markets may see Biden as the more stable and mainstream candidate.
Everyone is scared of this election but its the next one thats going to make you shit your britches
I‚Äôm loaded in CGC
On call or stock?
Right now Biden is at -370, which means you would have to bet $370 in order to win $100

So doing the math - if you bet $100, you would win another $27 (plus get your $100 back)
The kind that makes shit ton of money and is also hyper liberal. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
269 - 269

The market is currently seeing that the Gov will be divided and nothing will get done.  That is the worst-case scenario at this point which will ensure that we keep chugging along in the market.
Lmaooo watch, my boy Trizzamp got this. You'll be 'protesting' with the butthurt liberals once you realize Biden lost

Cross my fingers here that NVDA trades to 540. I loaded up big as it dropped in the past two weeks so I will cash in to get back to my core shares.  VIAC, MAR, SBUX, AMD, etc.  will also get trimmed so I can raise some cash.
Def going to be profit taking at open

Trump claiming the whole system is rigged, democracy is fake and being just short of encouraging open revolt is the bearish part about him losing.

Wtf is the market excited about? Half of y‚Äôall are saying it‚Äôs because a Biden win, which doesn‚Äôt make sense. Other half is saying trump. Lol

Key talking points so far:

- Don‚Äôt mess with McCain

- Dems failed to get out the votes, it seems millennials and Latinos didn‚Äôt come out and vote for Biden or Dem senators as pollsters had expected. (Waiting on demo data for confirmation)

- Biden didn‚Äôt respond to Trump attack that he is socialist (cost him Fl) and fracking (Biden comment in debate was unnecessary)

Someone dropped over $2M on $SPY 2/19/21 180P and I hoped on that bandwagon.  We'll see how it plays out,  closed down 20% yesterday.
Yeah I mean over the next few weeks/months. Looks like today was going to be green either way but this unlimited "stonks only go up" I think is going to waiver with Biden at the helm.

Are you saying that you can't vote for a third party cause they will guaranteed lose which would essentially waste your vote. But if you could rank them then you could for example have a fall-back vote on biden incase you voted for jojo but she didnt have any chance?

How did you not know this? Do you even stonk bruh?
If everything up and pot stocks are the play, why the hell are they all down premarket? This market makes no sense
Actually it is a really good indicator. BS grads who hold a degree in mathematics or physics have an average IQ in the low 130s. Engineering disciplines (EE, CE, CS) tend to be a bit lower with averages in the mid 120s. You'd only get exposure to eigenvectors through one of those degree programs. That alone puts the average person who knows about eigenvectors in the 92/93 percentile with respect to IQ.
are you a real female girl?
The market wants only one thing, that‚Äôs certainty.
never ideal to do that

Imagine thinking Trump will leave peacefully. He knows he will be prosecuted so he'll create as much chaos as he can to shift away the attention from himself
Fair enough. By American standards, the prices of homes have skyrocketed in relation to salaries, so while it may look desirable to you, it's not really affordable in the way it was for previous generations. My parents' house in the boonies of Arizona they bought in 1988 for less than $100k. It's now worth almost a mil. You can't tell me that someone who was making $100k a year in 1988 is making 7 figures in 2020.
There's way more outstanding votes in MI than NV.

I voted for and wanted Biden to win but I still think the market ticks down on his win.
So lemme get this straight: 

-Trump win was bullish

-Biden win is bullish

=>stonks only go up.
In that case, my face was right there under the pounding.
I fucking hate this, I have had puts at the best times logically possible, Trump had Corona, Trump tweets no stimmy, election uncertainty and the market has pumped EVERY SINGLE TIME

Wow MI is close... odds Biden actually pulls off the comeback there?

Well it seems it‚Äôs not as contentious as the market thought it could be (I did say only 35% chance). Trump is going to court & trying to stop votes from being counted. But that‚Äôs just normal trump stuff so ... priced in I guess üòï (good for my $3k of calls, bad for your $50k of puts?)

Oh yeah baby, there's a whole world out there:

You can find some very obvious arbs on various betting sites that you can lay or bet against on an exchange like betfair.

tbh the online bookie market still seems kind of immature (like crapto once was) and it seems to be ripe with opportunities if you look close enough. Definitely more inefficient than option markets and you don't have fucking Goldman sachs fucking you at every corner
I don‚Äôt think Biden will win PA.

Trump has a 600K lead

There is 1M mail in ballots remaining. That would mean Biden would need to get 80% of those ballots to cut the lead and make it close.
Biden at -360 now. Odds continue to move in his favor

NV, MI, WI, NC and GA. Biden's only chance is mail in, but that's not an unreasonable shot given the current reporting rates + the fact that D's look like they far outweighed R's in remote ballots. Could break either way at this point.
NV, MI and WI are tight but the outstanding vote looks great for Biden. GA is also in play. PA also in play for Biden but that is a longer shot for him. Trump looking like he getting fired.

Biden already winning NEVada and Wisconsin. Michigan absentee ballots are being counted now which is why Biden managed to gain serious ground because vast majority are democrats absentee ballots (>70% historically). 

Good chance he takes Georgia too and possibly Pennsylvania (still hasn‚Äôt counted the entire absentee ballots from Philly and Pittsburg)

Why do you think Trump declared himself the winner at 2 am?
Fucking right lol

Like wtf that‚Äôs why lobbying is fucking annoying lol
If you bought at .14 a few days ago. It‚Äôs a pump and dump that has been reliable for the last few months
That is the mindset. It was a huge thing from Jack Welch who is lauded as a management genius for making GE what it is today.
Weird right
I still would not count PA out at all. We‚Äôre about to see a ton of mail in ballots come in for Biden by this Thursday/Friday.

Which is completetly legitimate. Not the voters fault that PA election laws are absolutely stupid, but no one wrote their laws with a pandemic in mind.

That‚Äôs literally the only argument you need that l the mail in ballots are legitimate. They rejected ones that weren‚Äôt already. No one wrote these laws with a pandemic in mind.

If you set $X on one outcome, it's how much you get back.

Ex. $100 on Biden, you will get $133 total back.

To calculate the percentage you can say,

3.40 / ( 1.33 + 3.40 ) = ~0.719 (71,9%)

Here you get the odds of it not happening for 3.40.

Because 1 / X + 1 / Y won't give 100% as the bookmakers always makes a profit.

Possible, but Biden needs about 66% of all remaining ballots to break his way. Given mail in trends and the biggest vote out being Dem strongholds, but it is a tough task.
Bearish channel is broke if she breaks 341 and holds
Nevada is only 8k votes difference and lots of areas where trump was up 70-80% still has votes to count. Reno +las leaves are almost done reporting. Michigan + Wisconsin are fucked

Uh u mean r/democratsyellingatbadorangeman
How would they know you are arbing if you're playing multiple websites though?

Say you've got Biden trading at 1.45 at one website and 1.50 at another. You back him at 1.45 then lay the bet at 1.50 at the other site. Easy riskless 0.05 profit. And since the sites aren't connected, they cant figure out you doing this

I guess people who arb play a lot of positions on both sides of the market, and they run some kind of pattern analysis or something similar to spot what you're doing?

He‚Äôs still gonna barely win lol

if it was 2/1 odds, you get ¬£2 back for every ¬£1 you bet. So you would make ¬£2000 profit in that scenario.

[https://ftx.com/de/trade/TRUMP](https://ftx.com/de/trade/TRUMP)

His odds of winning have never been lower than now. If you bought BIDEN futures or backed biden on any betting site earlier, you'd be getting 3.00 odds you could now lay for 1.36

God damnit I need to start trading elections. Even more interesting is different sites seem to have different odds, I bet if your bankroll was big enough you could arb this shit so fucking much

CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHOS WINNING?
We bounced three times off 340 on the 27th. Most of the volume was centered around 338 on the 26th/27th before we came down. So, if we are opening between 338/340, its either gonna get rejected off that and we will probably end up testing 223 again before we come back up. If we push past 340 and hold, the next meaningful resistance appears to be 345. So if we push past 340, I think we will see 345. 

&#x200B;

Basically im shorting at 340 with next friday 340 puts, will sell if we hit 341 and just watch. And will buy some short term calls around 330 but expect to see it go lower.
Just buy $MJ
Biden is going to win. The big question is will Trump leave

Breaking news!: thetagang is the projected winner. Do what you wish with this information.
The vote comes down to the final ballot in Michigan. It‚Äôs placed in the center of the White House. Both candidates are armed. The first one to get to the ballot wins.
it will turn 360 degrees and keep going up

Biden extended his lead in Wisconsin, he's now up more than 20k votes. Michigan numbers are coming in and Biden very close to over taking Trump.

Crazy how democracy works, right?
I think I‚Äôm going to.
Narrator: he can't.

They already have sided with the states plan (see North Carolina). As long as the vote was cast legally and on time, it needs to be counted. SCOTUS won't rule otherwise.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be Biden since the market will be less predictable/secure investment? I‚Äôm an idiot though so don‚Äôt listen to me
Yea, it looks like az, nv, wi and mi will seal the deal. There isn't anything to suggest that those won't hold even though some are close. He could still pick up GA also which gives safety net in case one doesn't close. 

PA is the long shot, probably stays with Trump, but even that is possible for Biden however unlikely.

Pick up some Jordan‚Äôs and weed too
Don‚Äôt ever use the word smart with me
If anybody is actually paying attention mail in/early ballots are suspected to be generally more Democrat votes. The fight has always been to not have them counted. Of the states that matter, both WI and PA do not count those early votes until election day. The longer they count, the more likely those close af races flip to blue.

The actual answer is that Trumpism and Facebook propaganda has vastly changed the political landscape, and nothing really makes total sense anymore.


Back in 2008, Florida was just sort of a regular blend of seniors, Latinos, Cubans, etc. Now everything is a clusterfuck.
Ditch the partisanship fool. If you want to make money, forget the ideology and look at the numbers. The places where the most votes are left are mostly urban areas and mail in ballots in particular. That's a huge edge for Biden.

Dey trying to take r gunz!
there are two lines of resistance, one at 338ish where its at now and the other is at 340. So if we break through those all bets are off and we probably wont be coming down from there. But if we are rejected off one of those we might get to test/chill at the 323 mark for a while. I have no idea which it will be, but im pretty sure one of those two things will happen today. I personally will be shorting if we go above 339.5, puts for next friday. Might buy some calls around the 330 mark but i think if we dip again it will be all the way down to 323. but goodluck today shit will be volatile regardless of which direction we go.

He waited way too late to run and people didn't take him seriously
Oh nooo not the aging WoW franchise with it's crusty unemployed playerbase
They already gave him AZ. NV is 6, WI is 10 (Trump could still take it). MI is 60k votes in Trump's favor, but keep smoking the hopium
Not a Yang supporter by any stretch but I would vote Yang over either of these guys
No he can lose GA/NC/MI as long as he wins PA and WI. 

He needs 2 of 3 of MI/WI/PA

If he flips GA then it‚Äôs pretty much over. But I don‚Äôt think he will.

Biden  has about 70% chance of winning. If you asked a few hours ago I would have said the opposite before I dug into the numbers in deep detail. 

Drugs win! Weed fully legal in AZ (not just medical), all drugs legal in Oregon, mushrooms legal in DC. This is what's really making America great again.
I wished Kanye got more votes. It would have made him happy and he needs that since his mother passed.

his mother passing was the root of all his problems.
Other people touched on it. Federal decriminalization is still on the table if blue wins. Still good plays. Jist depends on horizon.

Vote here for Biden
At this point it looks pretty good for Biden. He only needs MI, WI, NV, and AZ and he's very close or ahead in all of these with many mail in ballots outstanding, which tend to be very blue. Adding PA, NC or GA would just be icing on the cake. However, that's what makes it likely that Trump will cause a shit storm.

No
Let's take a recap- 

We rallied ignoring a Europe lockdown 2.0 because there were hopes of blue wave or at least a clear winner with Dems have a shot at flipping the Senate.

It's neither blue wave, POTUS is actively threatening to sue and call the elections fraud and Dems definitely lost the Senate with Mitch McConnell back in charge.

Remember, futures don't mean shit on such days. Things aren't looking good anymore. I was bullish in either case of Trump or Bien winning earlier. But now I am too scared to put my money on something that's against the fundamentals I can clearly see.

Don't behave like retards, at least book some of your longs if you see a green open. If we drop now, there is no good news left to save us.

Stocks are going to make big moves this week. You are in a position to buy oversold stocks and make big gains as we emerge from this morass instead of bagholding stocks and calls that no longer fit your strategy.

You're correct that the root of the division is our education system, but you're wrong that it's due to a lack of funding. 

The root cause of the division is that leftist school administrators have taken over from coast to coast since the late 1960's. School administrators in blue states are fully onboard with critical race theory, intersectionality, identity politics, and other ideologies explicitly intended to divide people. 

We used to have a unifying ethos in this country, believing in its founding principles. Leftist educators have been undermining that for decades.

On the plus side as we transition to a new lawless land with no borders coke prices should.go down a bit.
I also agree with both of you and so does the article that no-one will read. 

‚ÄúBillionaires‚Äô huge gains are largely due to a stock market that has steadily risen during Trump‚Äôs term of office. From election night 2016 through Thursday, the S&P 500 index returned 67%, including dividends, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index returned 125%.

Until the arrival of the pandemic, American workers were also making small-but-significant gains under Trump. The virus has caused inequality to widen in dramatic ways, with millions losing their jobs at the very moment the stock market rebounded while a few billionaires, especially those with tech companies, profited from rapid changes in how we live and work.

There‚Äôs a limit to how much a president, or any politician, can influence the powerful trends that have tilted more and more wealth to the top. The fortunes of the richest Americans have ballooned since the late 1970s. The top 1%‚Äôs share of U.S. wealth has risen by half, according to various estimates, while the top 0.1% -- less than 200,000 households with a net worth starting north of $20 million ‚Äì have doubled their share.

In recent years, the average fortunes of the top 1% and 0.1% continued to grow, but their share of total U.S. wealth flat-lined during former President Barack Obama‚Äôs second term and Trump‚Äôs first as the bottom 99% inched up. The very richest billionaires, by contrast, continued outpacing everyone else.‚Äù

Well yes, that's true but it is also quite rare. Electoral votes in most cases end up following the popular vote.  So if a large amount of votes are mail-in votes and remain uncounted, then the final results could change quite a bit.

Considering they knew and have out data of the declared party affiliation of them we know for a fact it's way more heavily Dem this year
It was a controversial paper ballot voting card where the ‚Äúfor‚Äù was a punch out. If punch out not complete and some part still attached, vote counters had to decide if the vote was for/against during Bush Gore election. That little punch out piece was called a chad. It dragged on for awhile. Arguably Bush stole the election.

One of things that is clear is Democrats failed to win was many votes among educated millennials who seem to have not skewed to Biden or Dem senators as expected. It seems like media expected all millennials to be Progressives like AOC.

Well, turns out I'm as bad at predicting electoral outcomes as I am picking stocks. Gotta go examine some self selecting information biases I guess
Not really honestly is probably the most bullish outcome for stocks not reliant on massive stimulus. Weakness in the dollar is a bit surprising though if we think smaller stimulus is likely

That‚Äôs what someone on this board did. Betting on both candidates at different times for easy arbitrage winnings. Now that‚Äôs a high IQ play
Echo chamber of the soon to be butthurt

Seems to look more likely Biden will win and futures seem to like it
Overall, the house would be cheap....to an American. Not to a Bulgarian. 

I was doing a crane commissioning in Jamaica with a US coworker. There is a lot of poverty there. When he looked up what housing cost, he couldn't understand why there were so many shanties as housing was really cheap to his perspective. He didn't recognize the average person on the island made nothing close to what he made. 

The US has a lot of open land for development. In Europe, sprawl is tightly regulated.

they prohibited those votes to be counted prior to election day. of course it going to take hours

Oh send me a link to three pics which show trump kissing a kid's cheek, and I will shut the fuck up

Trump declaring victory before it's official is like Zoolander walking up to the stage to get Hansel's male model of the year award.

100% reporting for duty
put that aside man, most people care about policy, as is evident by evangelicals supporting trump
So just to be clear for those Trump supporters who are claiming fraud:

1) Counting votes after election night is not fraud. 
2) Constitution allows for states to count and send in their results by DECEMBER 8th. 
3) Trump can't stop the counting. 
4) Mail-in ballots are leaning heavily towards democrats.
5) More than likely Biden will (legitimately) win this election, albeit by razor thin margins. But a win is a win.
6) Mango doesn't have a legal leg to stand on if he loses.

I'm not loyal to anyone, I looked into the laptop and was disgusted and appalled by what I found. I'm not even American and I am furious Joe is not in prison.

The left are ignoring this completely, and writing it off as a hoax when it has been proven legitimate. They ignore the fact Joe is aware that his 14 yr old granddaughter is being sexually abused and does nothing (the photos are there to see). I could go on and on with travesties but I can't be fucked because I realise no-one cares

Who is chad then >_>
Way I see it is Cuban cares more about himself and less about the average american.
And yet the Trump gang is so mega triggered by freshman house reps (AOC) they send them death threats. You make it sound as though the insanity is a one way steeet.

Big difference being the death threats are real and people have been caught. What you‚Äôre describing is a phantom.
I fell asleep who won
Predictions: 
USA doesn‚Äôt get meaningful stimulus until January. Retail sector gets destroyed, while hospitals get overwhelmed. Tourism leisure industries take another serious hit until March. Lots of bankruptcies and forclosures incoming. 

Puts on niche non web retail post December. Puts on real estate investment and retail investments (especially those that only showed meaningful profit in the past 3 years, as they are improperly positioned for value). Calls on pharma. Calls on mixed health and bargain retail.
So what‚Äôs happening? Who is winning. Woke up in the middle of the night lol
So the VIX apparently had all of this shit priced in lmao
all doable.  the mail in was dominated this year by blue votes the larger percentage that needs counting the more likely they will turn blue.
Why would people vote for Trump when he is accused of being both a pedophile and a rapist?

If Trump loses, he is going to announce himself as the Prime Minister of THE USA and transfer all the powers to himself.
Wrong
He knew what that homeless man had in store for him.
I think Biden punched a lot of people in the dick by not giving a big fuck you to the rioters. Not condeming BLM and Antifa by name was pretty divisive. I think that's why the state is so split. They look at one candidate as anti-BLM and the other as pro-BLM.
Well be talking about hanging chads soon and no I‚Äôm not talking about the asshole fucking the hot chicks.

Biden favored now on bovada. Big change from -700 Trump.

Looks like trump is fucked
Hell yeah! That‚Äôs a pretty nice gain, especially with how ER‚Äôs went for most tech!
Yes, the pandemic allowed large companies to capture more market share. Pretty disingenuous to say that this was trump's doing.
Lmao I am watching NBC and they are talking about dragging this shit on until January. Strap the fuck in.
About 1.25m votes outstanding, presumably mostly mail in ballots. Most outstanding votes are from Biden heavy counties. That plus mail-in tends to lean Dem could close the gap.
Unlimit up
within one percentage with 13 percent still to count.  The votes that need counting are mail in.  If one party had mail in turnout for respect of the rona which do you think it would be at a 2:1 margin?
It‚Äôs scary
"We want the law to be used in a proper manner, so we‚Äôll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop,‚Äù Mr Trump added. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want them finding any ballots at four in the morning and adding them to the list.‚Äù

Most states lean one way or the other all the time. Very rarely you get swings. I think Obama actually won pretty easily his second term.
No one needs to be convinced at this point, it's just the count
VIX gonna spike into open?
No matter who wins, stocks are gonna sky rocket until they can make up another epidemic, catastrophe or war (most likely this one).

If Trump wins, we'll continue the trade war and it will escalate to a level that will involve other countries and will create a new type of proxy war.

If Biden wins, the democrats will create a domestic terrorist attack and try to strip away our rights and we'll have reverse protests.

But don't worry and who cares! STONKS gonna pump for at least 2 more years before any of that stuff inevitably happens. I personally look forward to all of it.

>That contract has an approximately equal vega and delta.

Your responses are surprisingly coherent for this sub, but I have to ask, what's your thinking behind looking at Vega vs Delta? Kinda don't like saying things like the following, as few people understand options, but I don't even think of delta as an option risk and am scratching my head with what delta has to do with vega. You can make delta whatever you want, don't need the option for that.

Also, nothing inherently bad with owning vol just because it's high. No shortage of times I've seen high vol underpriced and low vol overpriced. It all depends on what you can extract from it, which often is quite a bit when it's high vol, which is why it's high vol. Also, as vol gets higher, range vol tends to explode and shorting it gets significantly more dangerous as you can get yourself chopped to itty bitty pieces, even on days it settles unchanged.

Stock market just gonna pump here now on everytime it announces orange is a projected winner for a state, and remain flat with Biden. SPY 360 EOW at this rate.
Side note: Kanye has 60,599 votes so far....I love you guys.
It might come down to PA which means this‚Äôll drag till Friday at least
The problem with GA is that with their electioneering that result will be contested in courts and overturned at every possible attempt.
Just woke up. So who won guys.
Biden, but barely
You went from a president that shouts 'america first' to an old man with dementia that loves china and you in some convoluted way believe this is a good thing?
Good idea
But the electoral college can decide to vote for whomever they want.  Example look at VA.  Trump won popular vote and look at what electoral college chose

It's fucking cheap as shit in terms of purchasing power. 

Try buying a house in Canada. A home in Detroit is like $30k. Hamilton, Ontario the same house, with the same crime, pollution, no jobs, shitty weather, and a lousy football team sets you back $600k and on top of this, the same job in Canada gets you less pay. 

Americans are completely sheltered from how brutally expensive housing is throughout most of the world.

I bought a house in the US as an expat. It took me less than a year to save up money for the down payment. That is unheard in most places. 

I got a three bedroom, two and half bath, WITH A CAR HOLE!

No way I could do that in the EU or Australia.

It seems to me that your brain has difficulty creating a cohesive thought. Media bias is something that affects both sides. The thing about media is that it gives you information to interpret. You have to use your own mind to do that. It doesnt matter if it is biased if you can use your own brain. For example Fox news if you notice, they will tell you how to interpret the news they are reporting. They will tell you what to think and then reenforce your own desire to feel right. Try it one day. Pay close attention to how they report.

Damn forreal
Yes but they need like upwards of 75% in the remaining counts... it comes down more to WI and MI. Biden needs both if he doesnt get PA.

all counting left is mail in.

Futures seem to be suggesting rotation out of small cap back into tech. I‚Äôm not reading much into it at this point though because futures have been all over the place all night and I think people I follow are way too quick to attribute it to the all knowing markets discounting one outcome or another when at best the outcome is unclear but likely leaning toward Biden winning. IMO futures are way too optimistic about discounting a trump win but probably just reverting back toward a more tempered outcome than Biden winning in a landslide and dems taking control of the senate. Today should be interesting. Still think there‚Äôs too much bullishness in general and assumption the vix must drop for a sustained rally which for some weird reason it seems is a narrative that‚Äôs been pushed by trump supporters for weeks. I can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre bullish because they believed trump would win or hoping trump would win because they were bullish but I‚Äôm thinking the latter given the desperation in some of those tweets.

Wrong thread
It's not propaganda completely. Trump said "depression" if Biden wins. That's highly unlikely. However, look at it from a logical perspective. Biden would bring more stability to the market. However, shit is overinflated right now. Market would likely revert back to mean in a normal economic environment with Biden at the helm. The issue is we're not in a normal economic environment. Yeah, stimulus and all would prop up the market but the Democratic corporate (and individual) tax plans would cancel that out. Add on the overinflated market plus shit economic conditions, and that's a recipe for a market fall. The only person to keep this shit inflated is Trump. Ultimate pump master.

TLDR: buy short dated calls in tech/oil if Trump wins, shit is going to moon. Buy 3-6 month out SPY puts if Biden wins.

Too late.  They ded already
If the mail in ballots trickling in do fuck trump I actually do expect it to be contested

And let me tell you whatever you think about the legitimacy of him doing that

It‚Äôs optically acceptable from the perspective of a lot of the right that if the mail in vote situation makes this look funky, they expect and want trump to put up a fight

So regardless of if you think that‚Äôs reasonable to want from him, it‚Äôs reasonable to anticipate it can happen if those conditions are met.

So there‚Äôs a bit of fud in the air right now imo.
I dropped out of college after 2.5 years because back in '95 if you could spell UNIX someone would give you a job.  If you could edit with vi(1) they'd make you a sysadmin.  It's all about cost/benefit.

Dude... Cuts have been made to our education system since the 60s.. hence the uneducated majority of his base
Because Dems failed to get a majority in the Senate
he watched "mars attack" too many times.
He never said we shouldn't count votes he said voting needs to stop.. Meaning you can't vote days after the election. He is 100% right.. Count the vote but no NEW votes.. See you nuts always spin things around to fit your narrative.
How will the markets react if Nancy becomes president

yeah i guess it make sense that its all just money flow. the # will change too if ppl just keep taking the gains as well, i'm assuming?
They don‚Äôt even realize they are already dead. No Californian is going to shitty ass Vegas with Covid rampant. People will be too scared.

Their only goal is to make money. So they need bets on both sides

They also adjust based on bets made. Sort of hedge

What? Lol. That doesnt make any sense. Maybe as a business leader you need to work on communication. Either way, its about principles. Trump going on TV and intimating that we should not count certain votes is to me the antithesis of America. This isnt some banana republic last i checked. But with enough weak minded greedy people, it could become one. Nothing in this world is guaranteed. Get a backbone and work harder.

I'll be honest. Biden winning would crush me. I'd be fine in a week, but I'd be gloomy for that week. Not crazy enough to make a TikTok of me screaming in my car but pissed enough to eat frozen food instead of cooking real meals for that week.

I know of some graduates who only attended a Uni so they could network with professors, peers that are old money, the alumni network is strong and well and alive. 

Graduating and being active in the activities, making friends and such in any Ivy league will give you the best network you‚Äôll ever have and most likely propel yourself for success. Then again, you don‚Äôt get into Ivy leagues unless you have some brains or some money - or a bit of both (those are the billionaires).

Many mail-in ballots/early ballots are paper that have to be collated differently, while some in-person/day-of voting systems are electronic. Same-day voting tends to be easier to count than mail-in/early ballots. 

This is a trend in our modern voting system, its just usually not as noticeable/impactful in previous election cycles, because mail-in/early voting tends to make up a significantly smaller portion of the votes than this year. I believe in 2016 only Pennsylvania was decided by mail-in ballots, while this year it will be a bigger contribution to the final vote-count in several states.

Even if ya had it... this is crap. Curves not even in contango, it's backwardated.
I was kidding. But also, fuck you!
You said to just bring one sheet of paper.
Market had priced a Biden win. Then it priced uncertainty. Then it priced Trump win, then back to uncertainty and now pricing Biden win. Basically a shit show.
Either way, it's a mess.
Methinks spy will stay relatively flat or trend down until open
just think that the last 5-15% are the last 5-15% cause they took exta time to get into the hands they need to get into and every vote fuckin counts, so if one box of 1000 votes was misplaced or lagging to come from the post office  then that final 1% is going to stay like that and itll be 99% reported until those votes grt counted, make sense?
There will still be one, just smaller
Mail-in votes are the long tail right now. Some states don‚Äôt start counting until Election Day.
Can someone explain why UBER/Lyft are going crazy rn?
The "lol" part was to imply I was kidding. I guess it wasn't clear enough. Everyone has the right to vote. I just think they should be doing it on election day as usual. And don't give me any crap that this is because of covid. You know damn well that in 2024, it's going to be these mail-in shenanigans all over again.

Welcome to 2020 ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù
The amount of support for the poor is pretty weak in some yes. West Virginia, Miss, and Alabama to name some I agree. If I recall some research supported by the Federal Reserve on income inequality.
here's the thing fellas
Satan*
Not true. Market just wants a clear result
Here is my best attempt at explanation.  No matter who wins some sort of stimulus will get passed. The parts that matter to markets like stimmy checks and small biz relief seem to have bipartisan agreement.  Key here is senate holding red. No blue wave means Biden can‚Äôt easily pass all these tax increases which largely helps big tech.  Also Biden win means he won‚Äôt fuck with China... I think Apple is the big winner. No more China trade war but also no corporate tax increase.
what‚Äôs wit the red dildos?
Me too. If you like chappelle, its just a funny, dumb stoner movie that is a must watch at least once
Longggg back
never believe the polls
No clear winner equals dropping all day
You didn‚Äôt realize that when indexes nearly went limit up when it looked like Trump would win? lol

Can I ask how you see pre market this early?
The election people are saying Biden is actually running better in Michigan than Wisconsin.
MIs next and that‚Äôs all Biden needs. Might even nab GA too
Told people to wear masks. Theres a clear list of things he did wrong in regards to this pandemic. 

And its funny because he was given the chance to win over people if he just did the right thing.
DOW was once 2% down while tech up 1%, I think back in March or April
go for red 20 for x3 baby
This from yesterday, right? Make new one today, will be huge tech day
There's no documented case of any American being denied a ventilator. Maybe a nationwide mask mandate? I'm not even sure if I agree with that honestly. America is a free country and freedom has a cost sometimes. In China they welded elderly people inside their apartments to die.
Did I win?
Ahh good luck man! Well, maybe think of it this way too: if dems win, stable markets mean predictability and steady growth. If you're looking at 8 years, blue waves for 8 years guarantees rational markets and hopefully better expansion for you and your bosses, etc. At least that's how I'd approach it. Good luck friend!
Betting markets pricing in Biden, and now futures are doing the same and tanking

Don't try to make my peepee hard like that. Don't give it hope.
I have no idea. With the election and everything else it‚Äôs all just speculation. I thought it would drop if trump won cause Biden was good for ev and solar. Looks like I was wrong though.
How did Wisconsin fuck up polling that much? Biden was supposed to win by like 8 points
Why not close the borders earlier than he did ? I remember thinking damn this virus is going to hit the fan SPECIALLY with all the international travel happening. He just didn‚Äôt want the big companies to suffer because he‚Äôs friends with them correct me if I‚Äôm wrong

No clear winner, yep we're going sideways.
Worn a mask from the start instead of contradicting that they work. Not have entire rooms full of people packed together without masks like he just had at his ‚Äúvictory speech‚Äù.

lol it's okay! even if I can somehow make at least one person see what I'm trying to say, then it's a win for me. I hope the best for you and your prospects!!

"Mostly peaceful protests" with occasional shootings, stabbings, and fires.
Dude you‚Äôre lost and that‚Äôs ok. Most of the remaining ballots are mail-in and skewing 60-80% Biden against very slim Trump leads, thus he‚Äôs now the favourite to win.

For real, I wanted to get a part 2 of [this](https://youtu.be/YZ46I3kMOr0)
Back to square one.  President doesn't matter
i'm gay
Biden -125 trump -105 on bovado now
Two different things.
could be worse
Bro this is literally setting up to be either the greatest bull trap of all times or markets simply decided they dont care any more and SPY hits 400$ eoy
Worst possible thing is happening for the markets. Republican Congress with a Blue Ranger president. We are so fucked. Massive crash incoming once markets react.
My bet rn is that Biden gets WI and probably NV, and Trump gets MI, NC, and GA. That makes PA the tossup that everyone holds their breath for. Yes, Trump has the lead, but the reporting is at like two thirds. There is a lot of room for Biden to swoop in, especially if it's more of this mail-in crap. I think Biden will win (unfortunately).
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yeah, but it will probably kill you, like everything else in that god forsaken wasteland.
Thanks for sharing this knowledge
How is that they can count millions and millions of votes but the last 5-15% is taking 9 hours? 

Is this normal? Seems real sus
Biden in the lead now in WI.

So the point that mailed in are pro Biden is true.
Omg some of these problems that arise in elections always seems like some office skit
he gon win
My degree is only going to end up being $31k ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You've bought too much into the propaganda.
How low do you think NIO drops to this week?
replied elsewhere -- not at the moment, but i'd like to get there in 4 years (or at the very least the next 8). Either way, can't see it helping my case to get there if my boss, boss's boss, etc. get taxed more
Flip Nevada donnie
never seen futures this fucked up looking lol
It was last friday?
Lmao SPY dumping now

CGC was up like 8 percent earlier. Now down almost 6 percent.

The market never priced in A trump blowout, which is what it looked like until around 1030pm
"Green Bay's absentee ballot results are being delayed because one of the vote-counting machines ran out of ink and an elections official had to return to City Hall to get more."

Lol imagine running out of printer ink rn
These next 2 months are going to be a shitshow if Biden wins.
I think the deciding state will be PA
Shows you that it was probably gonna happen anyway

Maybe a few, not nearly as many as democrats lmao. Democrats think rioting, arson, and assault are forms of political expression. Trump has always been against mail in ballots anyway. It‚Äôs different from absentee ballots and it‚Äôs an easy target for fraudsters
lol, those should pay off. congrats.
Only real risk now is Trump refusing to leave + civil war üòÇ

do you make more than 400k? Cuz even then... you only get marginal tax increase at income over 400k if Biden wins. Statistically then, you're in the 1.2% of the earners in the country. If so, good for you, and I wish the best

Of all the scenarios that i thought would happen this election, this current one is probably the nightmare scenario.
Fucking PLUG, if that counts.
It still looks like Biden is the slight favorite. What tips him over the edge is that most of the ballots yet to be counted are statically more likely to be democratic and for Joe.
Honestly picking out your pronouns for the day is probably more fun than picking out what options contracts you‚Äôre going to buy.

Basically dollar strengthens with close result, weakens with decisive win, but more so with biden

Biden WH, House with red senate most likely
You don't care that Trump will help your 'poor' friends live a better life? In all honesty you sound like a terrible friend. Frankly you really seem like a bitter person. Id be willing to bet you had a good looking woman leave you for a better man and that you're still upset about it. Seen this million times.. See, kid, I don't talk about making money.. I just do it.. My intuition is spot on that's why I am successful and I got you pegged damn near instantly that's why I am a winner and you are a loser. Good night kid, brush your teeth and crawl into bed.

I fully understand checks and balances. There's a big difference between that and completely unequal representation. The 20 least populous states the same population as california and have 38 senators compared to californias 2. Im all for giving a voice to the minority but that big of a disparity is just stupid. Not to mention people from many of the smaller states are woahfully uneducated and you have a perfect recipe for the country to go full retard.

God I'm a confused gay bear bull and idk what to do anymore
I like how the camera lady says, "Call 911" as she watches the victim bleeding despite the camera chick obviously recording on her phone.
The market is *far* more correlated with itself than with fundamentals. When the market as a whole goes up, even companies with abysmal fundamentals are more likely to be up. This is the decoupling everyone has been complaining about. When the stock market exists outside of the actual economy, it's all just gambling. Volatility becomes crazy.
Seems like Biden will get Wisconsin
Cannot see Biden flipping this now. He's so far behind. Trump has PA in the bag. Biden needs MI bigly
Grats Uber/Lyft holders, grats tech holders, c'mon BABA keep going and join them
Yeah. Nevada maybe will go red
So, no one has no idea how this plays out? Sounds stable.

Puts on PA.
Revert the 11th. Have state legislatures vote for senators, rather than state popular vote.
Looks like someone just got stabbed, there's no context to indicate it was for any specific reason. 

&#x200B;

How are ppl this stupid that they'll just blindly believe that based on a made up title?
It's about connections - real, as well as implied.

Going to the same school(s) as the future corporate and/or political elite can net you a pretty useful set of contacts and acquaintances for your own future, and any future employer knows that, too, which is one reason so much weight is placed on the name of your alma mater.

Ever interview for a position where you are one of hundreds of applicants? Any edge you can get, you will need, unless you have competence(s) that put you in an altogether different league to anyone else applying. Given there's a bit of a global shituation in full swing, jobs aren't going to become easier to come by for a while yet, I don't think.
Ok so let‚Äôs do some math here. Trump is leading in PA by 13 points. 74% votes counted. Now they say that the rest are mail-ins, very Biden dominated. Assuming that only a little more than half of that 26% mail-ins are for Biden, wouldn‚Äôt that be more than 13? Does a Biden win sound clear?

Edit: I‚Äôm retarded and can‚Äôt do math

Okay guys. Just playing "if game". If Biden win, there's high probability of Trump will held stim and do something to crash the market. Expect wild ride until Biden come in the office, but better for long run. I will jump in to leaps

If  Trump win, there is high probability of civil unrest and trade wars will be worse. This mild wild ride will turn worse in the long run. I will play risky move like fellow retards today and hope to save cash to build a bunker, in case of WW3

There‚Äôs a weird disdain I‚Äôm noticing, was watching fox, and Bret Baier was essentially having to explain how PA can be flipped due to the amount of mail in ballots, and presumably being Dem favored how it can flip.

I mean I have sqqq so I‚Äôm clearly not a genius
I die, blissful sleep üåëüåö

Up 7% premarket
Or just stop losing.
Trump def has a huge lead, but there are still 1.8 million votes, and  large number of them are in the counties with Pittsburgh and Philly AFAIK, so he could potentially bring back 5-600k if there is a huge bias towards Biden with mail-in. Slim but possible imo.

Bacause it‚Äôs United STATES of America. Each state has their own free will to set laws and whatnot.

Each state is intended to be independent from each other.

That‚Äôs what makes America different from other countries
Buddy youre tryna justify being cunty. Cut it out
right but GA and NC are almost fully counted. PA Trump has a pretty big lead. WI did have a swing to get Biden back up but that was because of the Milwaukee dump which is city votes so obviously for Biden but there is still lots remaining in Wisconsin to count which means WI could go either way
Weedstocks dumping probably due to red senate?
High. If Fauci even mentions it once, Biden would do it in a heartbeat via executive order.
Its not joe.  

It's the ultra woke culture.  The cancel culture. The super pc culture.  This is coming from a darky.  1 hard truth that I grew up with is we aren't Europe, we share nothing with them culturally, and we will never be them.  America is about multicultural individualism and Europe is homogenous collectivism.    Younger dems seem to put Europe on a pedestal... 

  Along the same lines.  Let's take climate change as an example.  As someone with with a stem degree, I believe its a serious issue, but I'm also pragmatic about it.  What can we reasonably do.... what's our actual timeline....   If I try to engage in constructive conversation about it, basically stating they are being a climate change extremist / over reacting, it turns into shut up,  im gonna yell loudly at you, you're anti science.   Its that group think, if you don't think like me, im gonna silence you, that im against.  They do that for a lot of things to try to shape the narrative.  I dont see the same type of ridiculousness coming from the right ( not saying they aren't rediculous too).  

That's some of it...a major part...there is more, but I feel like the biggest threat to America would be " turning into europe."

I was hoping biden would be lucid and a centrist.  He started drifting more to the left and I felt he'd placate that.

Looks like Trump has done it once again but what do I know. The man is a true mastermind of the election game.

Funny you bring that up. Thats some more scrub shit. Crying about a teeny increase. Also...not everyone on wsb got a lil baby account. Either way just stop crying idc if u get Trump or whatever.

Yeah TQQQ is up 9% premarket. I guess the market was waiting for an outcome and feels we have one.
Yup anyone with a pulse can see that. But so many salty dems in denial still
Name checks out
I don't think the argument that mail-ins should now be discarded holding up. What should have happened is that mail-ins and early voting should have been blocked from happening months ago. The nonsense we're having now is a direct result of mail-ins. People who can't be bothered to vote in person shouldn't vote. Also, election day should be a day off.
You know I would like to say that isn‚Äôt the case and in that scenario Biden actually wins and the mail in ballots aren‚Äôt heavily contested, but you might be right

Depends on state. PA gop legislators passed a law a few months back saying they can't count mail in votes until after polls close. Same in a few others as well.
Tesla has entered the chat
What about Land Slide? They said he would win!!
You guys talking about a global zombie apocalypse arising from a vaccine success gone wrong or a civil war?
Stop worrying about civil unrest. Civil war would send SPY to 500 at least

I think Andrew Hanen decision on the drive in ballots may bode well for my confidence that even if some crazy litigation comes from trump and friends, it won‚Äôt go far. Haney is a very conservative judge but denied that gop request, in the end I have to have some sort of optimism that the blatant suppression just won‚Äôt go by

You're the one acting mentally unstable though.
Depends on state, some do after all normal votes were casted, some count them first
even with Wisconsin Biden still needs to win PA [according to my EC](https://www.270towin.com/maps/1pk33), Trump will take PA to the supreme court where he has the judges and will win

If 45 loses strictly because of mail in ballots he will take it to the Supreme Court where they have ACB. This things over before it began....
It does.
We‚Äôre all losers!
Really they‚Äôre harassing this dude anytime he comments wtf.
why would they toss votes on recounts?
Obviously not over.  


However Mail in ballots skew heavy biden and largely that is what is left to count
Yeah he needs to flip one more
It does. It went for Hillary in 2016.
Nah tie is not possible
He should rent both...
same as the chance of cancelling easter and christmas
Yeah it goes to 400 by end of q4 and then crashes during 2021
Lol they dropped out so he could be the candidate
Exciting times we live in.

Lol this.... So much, this! Hahaha

Even if biden wins wisconsin?

Theoretically, no, however, no.
Hoooly fuck, tech premarket is going nuts. Fuck I wish I bought the dip more but I was going to stay patient before I throw my money in it. Guess I missed the bottom. My first election because I used to live in EU. I thought there would be much more red.
God, I hope not.
Totally, but Minneapolis at least twice to 3 times smaller and just put Biden up, and we know that most of the mail ins are democratic. 75% of 1.5 mill is 1.1 mill for Biden, so it‚Äôll be neck and neck for sure. This shit is crazy either way.

Yeah. Like, be the first motherfucker to see a new galaxy, or find a new alien lifeform... and fuck it. And people'd be like, "There he goes. Homeboy fucked a Martian once."
What I don't get is how mail-ins could be counted last. Wouldn't they be one of the first to get counted except for the mail-ins that were at the very last moment?
Theoretically Nancy P. can still win
That is, fucking retarded

alexa play there goes my hero
I thought Green Bay leaned blue
Mask mandate, step up testing
Are you still playing Pton? Thinking about making a move and holding thru earnings
He probably talked to election officials to get the numbers on which counties and types of ballots are currently uncounted, which would have shown him it's largely urban mail in votes, meaning Biden still has a good chance. Don't think it's really that complicated or shady.
This is the melt up I‚Äôve been waiting for
Smartest/most real of all the candidates honestly
You see 270 I see civil war
tbh the race in GA and NC is tight as fuck, so it's not a sure wrap

neither is PA since it's only 64% counted

and looks like Sleepy is already taking WI which you wouldn't expect a few hours ago
*slaps her ass*
All of it. My account is 100% Intel and there is now way your comment has any legitimacy.
hey man at least its not frisco
Mail-in plus Detroit. Mango hasn‚Äôt done enough.
Split house and senate
donald is winning the election. sorry guys
Fuck no, follow the trend, never try to anticipate
Green Bay leans Red and still coming in, its not over
Zero?
Honestly don‚Äôt see that happening, the way Donnie acted earlier seemed different. May just try challenging in court and all but I don‚Äôt see anything really happening
Just wait 5 minutes.
Sounds like you shoulda had a better hedge if you lost half your portfolio
WISCONSIN
Not at all, friend.
So spy 200 or 400? That's all I want to know
No one is winning since neither has 270. That is all that matters. Trump could have 268 right now and it wouldn't mean shit.
my spy puts expiring next week are down 70 percent,i am dead inside.
spy under 330 today bet
He‚Äôs mentally unstable, it‚Äôs pretty funny to me
I think Trump is fucked

My feeling is GA, NC, PA, MI all go red and Wisconsin goes blue

My msft calls I bought Monday appreciate this mm
That‚Äôs the worry. Market can handle clean win either way.
What even is this rally
seriously. I almost cant help but feel like its an intentional stonewall after Shapiro‚Äôs comments earlier today.
No one cares

No, it‚Äôs the beach area. It‚Äôs super rich people who own a condo or luxury apartment, poor people living above there means, and homeless people. I unfortunately am not the first one.

dunno, they're like +700k ahead i doubt mango will lose PA
whats the chance of a full scale lockdown if biden wins?
45 already won SC bro
Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia are pretty clearly still up in the air
Trump has 52% of the votes counted in Michigan with Biden below 47%

That doesn‚Äôt sound likely
GG
Yep
Mail in + Detroit. He is fuk.
He would have to win Mi and not lose GA
I saw that but he needs more
youd think those bleeding hearts would be smoking more weed. Berkeley probably smelled like bongwater earlier

Why is trump favorite to win on the betting sites?

PA needs to get their ass in gear and start counting
Mango gonna tank the market when he contests the results. VIX 40c and Short ES
Didn‚Äôt Trump win MI in 2016? He‚Äôll win it again
Even if Biden wins it will be contested
That's because the duopoly is just one party with two different factions. They split up the voting base about halfway to ensure their constituents stay in line and keep any other parties from being relevant.
the past probably meant being able to trade while being mobile. But the future flexes weirdly. 

it's all about the clout
Georgia and Wisconsin can decide it
i know next to nothing about socal. is that the hood?

Do we have a SITUATION here!?
Feel like Georgia could too.
What are the chances that if Biden wins Trump opens whatever he can open to pass the hottest, covid laced, potato on the next administration?

Market wants a clear winner. Who that is does not matter as long as someone wins quickly.
Sir, this is a WallStreetBets
No they don‚Äôt realize that lol
All exceptionally worse than Kanye I have to admit
Depends on the county, some of them with plenty to count are skewing as high as 80% Biden.
president boinks bears - cnbc
I told my friends earlier the margin for error is so small and Trump losing AZ was a bad sign. That was his Michigan that Hilary lost last election
that‚Äôs literally been the case the entire election cycle.
lmaooo the only real answer
That and fact most of Europe subsidises education through taxation. 

Not likely to fly in the US any time soon.
I f it weren't for Trump being so despicable we wouldn't have to be Biden supporters.

We could talk about the increase in capital gains tax if that is more applicable to you but I am highly doubting that would apply to you. I am absolutely certain raising taxes on 400k+ income is no concern to you. Lol go to bed kid.
How do u do this
Mail in will be overwhelmingly blue because mango told his base to vote in person. It's looking fucking grim for mango.
[removed]
Hey! Detroit is relevant again!
60-40 for mail in is what has been reported
Right... He doesn't need all the states that are leaning red to win... Big underdog lol
I think MI going blue too
wait for it, it'll go back to where it belongs soon enough
It is true, i have a bachelors degree and I'm on this sub
don't look like that. Market have priced in Biden.
This is setting up to be the greatest bull trap in history or last week was the biggest bear trap ever.

Either way markets are going bigly up or down

GA and NC is pretty tight but I think PA could be a wrap for Mango
Hot take: Earnings is today, ANT ipo stall doesn‚Äôt change how profitable both services are, and the ipo will come back to the table/ the second they give timeline or even any sort of disclosure what new timeline ipo for ANT will be it will explode up in price again, albeit probably with small correction down if USA red politic win, small correction up if blue win, etc and maybe a small trend down due to ANT debacle making people remember how under a jackboot all commerce is China. Either way, it‚Äôs still gonna be a buy.

well guess what, a MAJORITY of billionaires have degrees or some type of post secondary education. 

Fuck the richest man on earth does
They will recount if it.stays this close. When that happens there will be votes tossed away and mango will win

Most of those mail in ballots are for Joe Biden....
Sleepy is a sleeper confirmed
It is wonky in its own way, yeah. What's wonkier to me though is the idea that if Biden wins, it's going to be because of rule changes regarding mail-ins and early voting made just before the election.
They claim its to prevent 2 states to count the president and look where we are right now, could literally be down to PA for either candidate.
Not good not good
Yes 45 needs mi at this point
explain who‚Äôs winning like Im 5 ..
Lmao so many retards in here still think market is pricing in Trump üòÇüòÇüòÇ
He would need one more state to flip. It seems tough to me.

MI has the most realistic margin and plenty of votes remaining.

I think we will get a better idea today.
Bro this exact scenario was so blatantly obvious the second Trump started talking about mail in ballots like 6 months ago.
[deleted]
Exactly. It‚Äôs alll speculation
What I meant was that those mail ins will be pro Biden and he'll likely lose the election.
A lot of the remaining ballots are likely blue ballots, thus Trump wants to burn them in the court.
Nothing for you to worry your pretty head about darling

Yeah, thing is there's plenty of ballots that's still yet to be counted in those places. I can see that, he looked mad during his press conference earlier.
If Biden takes WI then Trump needs all 4 states to win, Biden just needs 1 of them. Biden looking like he will win this. I think the big brains in the trump campaign gamed out the math and knew there was a problem and that is why Trump threw a tantrum.

Gotta figure it out homie
Yeah man, should obviously be popular vote.

Trump is still ahead in Mi, Ga, Pa, NC. And if he were to lose those too due to mail-in, you know that he is going to fight like crazy down to the very last lawsuit
Finally amazon no longer dumping like ass
You do realize that this is not about the votes but the attempt to cut off counting mail in votes and by doing so stealing the election, right?

Trump declared himself the winner and wants the counting to stop. The race now is to get enough votes counted before he can get the cronies they packed into the Supreme Court to cut off vote-counting, so the results represent the vote as much as possible

pretty much, green bay‚Äôs county also has a huge mail dump which will most likely be democrat, we will have to wait and see for michigan and georgia and Pensylvania

Georgia will not be blue anytime soon
Yup it's really fucking sad, 2.3 billion years of evolution on this planet and it all lead us to this moment, choosing which retard is the least retarded in leading 400 million fucking people, it's absurd.

Biden leading Wisconsin now confirms the absentee votes stuff 

Lol this market gonna tank again if he takes over Wisconsin
Its probably the most boring city of that size in the world
Yo if Biden actually wins in a couple days off of mail in votes imagine how mango will react
So Trump with a larger lead and less votes to be counted is somehow less certain to you? Okey dokey ü§°
I mean it's not called, but he basically sealed it with the Milwaukee vote dump

Still 23% more of the vote left in Milwaukee which will give him a safe lead in WI
Eat hot chip and lie
that's the fucking beauty of it. half of this sub is all in, but almost no one knows anything about the company lmao

It's a high risk but NIO's retard strength will definitely pay out. 

I think leaps would be a better option than stocks on margin though. My broker forced me to use a 50% stop loss. With 5X margin a 10% downswing would be enough to close my trade.
Wisconsin or the election?
Looks like my puts gonna get me some tendies. Good boy.
Health insurance went up because before the ACA, health insurance was fucking useless. Didn‚Äôt cover shit, and a lot of people who got serious health problems still had to claim bankruptcy even though they had insurance. Easy to forget how shit it was before ACA, it‚Äôs been 10 years.

I mean he was smart about it. He just kept through and stayed consistent. He knew his opponents would drop out from the race.
It‚Äôs a close Ass election, though trends are seeming to show, republicans showed up in person, the mail in is coming, which also is setting records HOWEVER and I‚Äôll say this, it‚Äôs imperative these numbers show up in the battleground states,
I didnt know trump had an economic policy. Mocking the handicap, bragging about sexual assault, talking shit about gold star families, calling the fallen military suckers and bragging about gaining votes from murder is probably the correct rhetoric. One thing i do know is that people who call themselves grown adults are probably not grown adults. I grasp that people don't want dems, i grasp that fully and completely accept the results. What i dont grasp is people who defend that rhetoric and no economic policy.

Whoa wtf happened to JKS. Glad I didn't touch that.

FSLY and AMD up big.
They released new processors, GPU's, and announced a 12th straight quarter of datacenter growth?

IDK, big tech is green after weeks of red which is nice.

20k now with 10k ish for Biden in Kenosha

I swear it feels like both parties are trying their hardest to lose sometimes. Most anyone that was in the primary but Biden probabaly would have been a blue sweep, then they have to choose kamala, who both sides seem to dislike. And then the reps have Trump saying the dumbest possible things at every possible turn. There are 400 million people in this country and these 2 are what we have to choose from?

i think its about 9-18% a year depending on how much you borrow. i figure if i hold for a few months nio is bound to move up substantially and only have to pay 5-10k for using the margin. all theoretical of course.
Sleep tight sweet put prince.
47-45 Reps with 6 seats to go (Reps won 17/29 seats tonight so far)
Nope. Clear Biden victory. With a blue senate.
Yep. Good. More certainty is good for calls

It's ok, I still have 300 shares and sold weekly puts 2 days ago

fine analysis. Trump still won, but spot on!
>9:30
>300 dorra




Congratz youre the biggest tard for the day
They already counted 1M, only 1.4M left to count. If they are the same ratio then Dems gain 636K not including independents. 

Assuming 60/40 D/R from independents, that‚Äôs another gain of 40K to total 676K. Dems are behind by 690K. That would leave them still 14K short of Rs.

Holy shit, it‚Äôs going to be close
Yea if Biden wins WI Trump could be toast and we still have GA where it's close still too

Only 77% still in Milwaukee... Biden has WI in the bag now more than likely.
I think so too, but it might take a year or 2. Isn't holding stocks on margin expensive as fuck?
Dude they literally wouldn‚Äôt be able to make any decisions that‚Äôs the stupidest thing I‚Äôve fucking heard all night
Wow, super close. Any chance WI will turn back red?
Yeah but still 23% of vote in Milwaukee

He's taking WI for sure.

Now it comes down to MI, PA, and weirdly, GA
4real. He'll be like a high school senior who already got accepted. His golf time will double.
So I‚Äôve been watching the reversals of stocks for the past 10 days. When Biden looks winning, the bubble stocks retreat, industrials, old energy, defense/aerospace shoot up and most other stocks do better. When Trump pulls ahead, the bubble stocks (basically tech & stay at home stocks) advance & industrials & other stocks sink. 

Right now, the DJIA is down & NDAQ is up huge. So it looks as if the market thinks Trump won.

Lol apart from 15-20 universities? That‚Äôs ridiculous there‚Äôs significantly more than 15-20 majors, there‚Äôs more than 15-20 job industries, there‚Äôs more than 15-20 states. There are so many factors that affect success after graduation as well based on the university. Do they have good alumni programs, do they have partnerships with local businesses, do they have regional or national recognition? There might be a distinct top 15-20 PUBLIC schools that stand above the rest, but then what about all of the private schools in the Ivy League, or schools like Stanford, Vandy, etc. ?

*editing this in: admittedly I am finishing my degree this semester at a top 5 public school without any debt. However, I do agree that for most people spending significantly more money to go to a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù school is a waste. It‚Äôs just ridiculous to suggest that the quality of education is the same bar 20 of the thousands of colleges and universities in the US. *
My private health insurance that I pay for is provided by employer... Rofl.. If I didn't have a job I wouldn't have to pay.. The reason my costs went up is because I have to pay for people without a job... You must still live with mom and dad.. Or should I say.... Just mom?

He is down ~700k right now so he will need trump to get less than ~500ish k votes

But he might win no?
Tfw no alien gf
I will never understand why smart money let Amazon get back down to $3000
Just did.   I should really be buying stock also and not just these options
Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Rockefeller. Elon Musk dropped out of Stanford in a record 2 days time. But the thing is, a lot of these people dropped out of Harvard and the like. And that‚Äôs a bit different from dropping out of your local college.
Do you actually think Biden‚Äôs gonna win? Seems no one thinks that‚Äôs likely rn
If Trump wins (which is likely), day traders are saved. Biden's tax plan was going to tax something like 2% of each buy which is a big deal for day traders that care about tiny percentage changes. I don't remember the exact number. Big deal for every trader, but crushing for day traders. Could be something else though.

If you can call AZ at this point that would indicate a win for Trump in GA, NC, WI, and PA

Look, you probably will make money, but 10%, 40%, 120%, it will never be enough for your greedy ass. Reading your comment I can see you are acting very emotionally. Don't do this when you are up 50%. Cash out and don't be greedy. Please remember this.

It's a great slogan for a first term, but it really makes for a weird second lol. I've heard Keep America Great Again and Make America Great Again Again, but it seems the staff just decided to go with doing Make America Great Again a second time because it sounds good. Sure is better than the plagiarized "Build Back Better" that Biden stole from Boris Johnson; Biden didn't even steal a good slogan.

And yes, I know Make America Great Again is a slight alteration of Reagan's "Let's Make America Great Again," but that one was a good steal because it's a good slogan and his fanbase already loves Reagan, so it doesn't matter if they find out.
Grown ass man
I think you can say that about a lot of places though. I see what you‚Äôre saying, Cali is lit don‚Äôt get me wrong. I live in Tennessee though, and we get some damn good Marijuana (usually from Cali), I didn‚Äôt go to college and still have a manufacturing job that pays 75k a year, and it‚Äôs wayyyy cheaper here. I would rather be financially stable then have more places to blow my money on.
Sounds like you go to a dogshit school and are in a dogshit program.
I'm not sure why this is getting down voted, it's pretty much peak WSB.

Lmfao my tuition cost (big state school, 4 year university) for my bachelors & masters was a total of 2.5k in the US. I received zero merit based or additional scholarships through the school/clubs/community, only earning a merit scholarship offered through the state (many states have this scholarship program, for example both my state of Florida and the state of Tennessee have this)

Hi u/WSBnon-believer Check this retard out
College won't do anything for those that can't get anything by themselves.  People who are really good at getting things for themselves don't need the tiny benefit college would provide.

Folks who want to do a specific thing without trying too hard benefit the most from a degree because it makes them hirable without having to really put in the grind.  Fresh grads from 4 year schools are usually just as useless as 18 year olds in their first job, but they have the paper to say it's where they are supposed to be.
Trump claimed victory early, said there was no way the dems could catch up. Pence walked his comments back saying they were on the road to victory, which brought the market back up.

You have missed out big time on the Danish Renewable sector.

Holy shit the entire solar sector is taking a dump.
Let‚Äôs all just vote again and start over
Regardless of politics, the fact that a literal dead man can get elected to office, presumably because people are so partisan they just tick the box with the letter they want next to it rather than learning anything about the candidates, is probably a bad sign for our country as a whole.

Ok boomer
For the exact reason you said: if Trump is elected **expectation** will be that things will continue bullish and we will get a stimulus. (Honestly the fact that people are freaking out over a POSSIBLE stimulus after months of nothing should spell out how fucked we actually are, but I digress) basically it‚Äôs an ‚Äúthe devil you know... type situation‚Äù. Short term (aka good for FDs) is great! (Or was until the announcement of Supreme Court decision which may take till next week?) Long term... who the fuck knows. Honestly I‚Äôm expecting a pretty severe drop like we had around 2017 followed by a steady-ish recovery. But what the fuck do I know? But since you‚Äôre (basically) asking on Reddit... by Friday:   
If you think trump will win: but SPY 350 c for... mid nov. 
if you think Biden will win. Buy SPY 325 p For mid November and then SPT 350c late dec/early jan when things stabilize.

Edit: also I based this on nothing but the coin flip and shots of tequila I‚Äôm having. Or as WSB would say: ‚Äúserious DD boys!‚Äù
LETS GOOOOOO WISCONSIN TURNED BLUE
Fatty
What does that have to do with being Republican?
Not being Biden or Clinton. That's pretty damn good. Probably my biggest thing is this actually. All the things that didn't happen because he was in office I count as good.

His foreign policy has also been surprisingly good: getting Israel to normalize relations with some of its neighbors, giving Iran a BTFO, talking with Kim Jong Un, and getting Kim Jong Un to talk with South Korea are all massive. Media said we were going to have WW3 like 10 times over or something but that never materialized just like a lot of the media's crap. There are still a lot of things to do with foreign policy, but I think we're on the right track. At least, we're not going to war with a bunch of random Middle Eastern countries for hardly any reason like we did with Obama.  I'm hoping we offer Hong Kong and Taiwan more political (not economic) support in the second term. 

Economic and stock recovery after the covid crash is not complete but it is genuinely happening by pretty most measures. Yeah, I wish we had a second stimulus to speed it up and calm hysteria, but you can't have it all I guess. Tax cuts and tax credits are always nice. 

There are other things, but I'm not sure what you value as a good thing, so there really isn't a point in me listing them. His admin has not been perfect, but at the very least, I'd say it went much better than a Clinton or Biden admin would have gone.
Will probably correct somewhere coming weeks but overall you should hold this. I remember being a retard for buying at 3.40 and selling at 4 thinking I was a genius back in February. This is a long hold for sure.

There's a third - you already have an idea or a skill that's more valuable than a college degree so why bother.

BREAKING: In this election, one candidate announces residents of New York, Texas, and California will receive every tax dollar the US has. *wins election*
Except this is relevant information given large amounts of dem voters used absentee ballots to cast their votes especially in swing stages. Cov 2 nor absentee ballot counts were a major factor in 2016 election. Hillary lost it by 2:30 AM eastern with 90% of votes accounted for.
god damnit, take my upvote and get the fuck out

Actually we do. The numbers are public. PA last I checked had 1.8M uncounted mail in ballots.
The only states in play are MI and PA. Biden needs both.

At the extreme estimates for uncounted ballots and share of the vote Biden could still pull PA, but that's a deep outlier case statistically. 

That said, I wouldn't call it yet if it was over $10, so they're definitely not gonna call it over the presidency. 

As soon as PA reports their final count, then it's probably over.

millions of uncounted mail in ballots that are probably majority dem have not been included
Haha this is wsb bro
My anti depressants did until I smoked myself out every night
Right, cause Trump can't say the vote favors him, but you can just say early/mail votes favor Biden. Makes real sense.

Common sense would tell you if Trump's up in every one of those States, and Trump doesn't even need to win all those States, then your boy Biden lost.

The math is very hard to overcome. With your numbers, those PA votes would have to be 70% for Biden to win.

Which was I think. I could be wrong a manufactured problem. PA for example passed ballot reform in March to start doing exactly that. Michigan for some reason despite approving(on Oct 7th 2020) mail in ballot reform to start "processing" mail-in ballot a DAY before.

Dude you‚Äôre gonna pay taxes no matter what on gains unless you‚Äôre in a Roth IRA. Shares is definitely the way, no theta fucking you with large holdings.

You can do some options as a hedge against your shares but that would be the extent of it if I was you. Maybe a few thousand on calls. But the overwhelming majority, don‚Äôt be stupid.

If you want to park a million bucks into Tesla calls, you deserve to lose every penny.

Edit: your house rental is ridiculous too. Wow. Be smart about this shit. Assume a 7% annual return per year you‚Äôd be getting $6,709 per month for the rental. Pretty good. But you seem more likely to lose the million than make money off it with the questions you ask.

VTI or VGT ‚Äî and then sell FD covered calls on your large share holdings (or do nothing and let them just grow). Jesus Christ. Don‚Äôt be a fucking idiot.

Not sure if this is a shit post. Probably is.
In nearly every state mail in either has to be received by day of election, a few states have their law set as postmarked by day of election or received within X days of election, and most of those that have laws within X days after election are red states, so it's not some conspiracy. Each state sets its own rules on how operate their elections, that is law and their choice. The laws aren't party X ballots must be 5 days early and party Y can be 5 days late... It is all equal opportunity and determined by the state officials and law makers who make decisions on how it is ran, not up to trump or the SC. 

People don't know shit about civics in this country but they can figure out how to blow up an account in 48 hours on some BS DD. The retardedness of our country is what makes America such a special place.

3.1m total absentee votes in Michigan. Latest estimates are 20% counted so far so 2.5m ballots left to count. Trump has 320k lead in Michigan. If 65% of remaining absentee ballots are Biden (probably will be higher given what we know on voter skew of mail in ballots) then Biden wins MI. 

Wisconsin is similar situation. 2m absentee ballots total. Trump has 110k lead in WI. Only 25% of absentee ballots counted in WI as of a couple hours ago with none from Milwaukee (a city that Hilary won by +40% in 2016 and alone could be net +100k for Biden). If 60% of remaining absentee are Biden (likely to be more given Milwaukee), then Biden wins WI.

NV is over just not yet called.

NV + MI + WI = 270 and Biden wins despite losing PA.

It‚Äôs in plain sight.
how tf is NIO going this parabolic this consistenly the ONE WEEK I SELL COVERED CALLS
Trump has a decent chance of winning Wisconsin and GA looks a lot healthier. What‚Äôs crazy is PA has almost the same amount of vote as 2016. Where the fuck did all those extra 1M votes come from ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Biden said it's not over until every vote is counted. I know I heard him right because he mis-pronounced several words and kept starting over saying the same thing even louder. He did a good job though he did manage to struggle through that train of thought.

I don't get it either. I personally liked a decent amount of his policy, but I hate how he is as a person (although he is absolute comedy gold).

In my state, there's a lot of bitterness and resentment toward democrats and liberals on what seems to be an almost personal level. Its wild to me, maybe because I was too young to understand at the time, but a lot of people seemed personally insulted and aggrieved by Obama and those in power during his time.

I think it's a product of seeing the liberals as more educated, and therefore typically higher earners and less religious. It breeds resentment and an inferiority complex. Then you have tough guy Trump swoop in and shoot from the hip. It makes the "downtrodden" (whether they actually are or not doesn't matter) feel empowered again. Like, over the last 4 years is when I started hearinf the term "soyboy" and other stuff equating education with emasculation. Its a very strange turn.
My dad, smartest man I know is trump supporter, find it funny hearing comments like that. Always surprises people too when people find out my dad is a trump supporter, and it‚Äôs literally the dems biggest problem with Latino voters in the sense, some of the biggest values are religion, morals, law an order, and shit like that.

It's almost like "the covid cases only go up if you keep testing"
Makes sense
For reference 1.5 million registered dems voted early in PA. 500k registered Republicans voted early. Thats a 1 million vote difference for the autists out there. Almost none of these votes have been counted. Right now Biden trails in PA by less than 700k. 700k is in fact less than 1 million.

So no, its not over.

Could Trump still win, sure. But so could Biden and that's the point. Trump knows those mail in ballots are the last to be counted so he's trying to preemptively claim victory and stop them from being counted. Even if he does legit win its authoritarian as fuck.
[deleted]
I voted you up, but I think they can smell I‚Äôm not ‚Äúone of them‚Äù.
The real problem is we have an election day not an election month. Everyone in the world knew election was today. It's hard to argue pulling in votes AFTER an election has taken place is legitimate no matter how one looks at it.

It‚Äôs kind of crazy that Biden winning is staring everyone right in the face but most people are too shell shocked to realize or believe it.

The math on remaining absentee ballots heavily favors Biden in WI and MI. He only needs to win WI, MI and NV to win. NV already seems locked. Trump likely wins PA based on math and remaining ballots there.

I did it bois. Commented on r/politics and got downvoted into oblivion.. feeling rejuvenated

I think it‚Äôs because if Trump wins, then it‚Äôs more likely that:
1. Stimulus is smol 
2. Covid lasts longer 
Both of which are good for tech.

Explain to europoor. [https://apps.npr.org/elections20-interactive/#/president](https://apps.npr.org/elections20-interactive/#/president)  means Trump has probably  won, right? He's leading in almost all the undeclared states.

If Biden can flip 2 of the swing states he wins
Lol I know what you were referring to, I just wanted to give you a chuckle is all
I think we might be back in easy mode like In April
Not until after the election. Like next week maybe
I think you misread dude. I'm talking about his supporters that love him for his politics and dont give a shit about policy

People should vote for what gives them the best life, not who gives them an anger erection
Higher than it‚Äôs currently trading at least
RIP clean energy
Lol good job WSB you didn‚Äôt bull the market nor bear it you fucking made it push sideways ya fucks.
I googled it. Looks like we'll have a bunch more numbers out of PA tomorrow morning and will have updated counts through Friday before certain states can be called for sure. It's likely that many of those votes will lean D.
This is just called the ant ipo

I have a pretty good idea what the market will do but I'm not foolish to think it's going to be decided by some votes, Biden likely wins tbh and the market melts up on stimulus news
Got um!

The problem is that this was called multiple times. Mail in votes are most likely to change the outcome towards Biden in key states , but trump is already prepared to battle that shit with it being fraudulent... seriously great democracy

maybe my GME calls are saved after all
It seems like you haven‚Äôt seen a heat map of the electoral college so far. Trump is in the lead in all of the swing states that haven‚Äôt been called yet.
Because the states that are still undecided have about 75%+ polls reported with Trump winning most of them by 100k-300k ish. As votes come in that margin will probably stay the same (law of averages) ... so obvious that Trump will win but the left media refuses to acknowledge that
And then they‚Äôre surprised by a Trump win
[deleted]
Tru
I'm always surprised Trump is so generally popular.  If it's a policy thing I get it, I can understand or even be willing to give a chance to policies that I don't support because hey, at least we get some data on what's the best way forward.

Where I can't square the circle are with people who love him FOR the shit he pulls, like that speech tonight, suppressing the USPS, inviting Russian or Ukrainian influence into the election or against his political opponents, Proud Boys etc.

I don't think he's Stalin, but folks who know who he is and still look the other way because they want slightly lower taxes are fuckwits. We're all here to win money, but what are you gonna buy if the govt crumbles around you? As opposition we don't matter unless we win, but maybe if his base expected more from him we wouldn't be in this situation.  Used to be both sides grumbled about the president as soon as he took office.  This cult shit doesn't feel right.
Ok retard, you‚Äôre right, the Babylon bee called it at 1%

You‚Äôve said that twice now. Why?
It comes down to the electoral college. The states remaining that have a lot of electoral college votes that haven‚Äôt been called in favor of a party, are all leaning in trumps favor (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina). If the race ended this exact second, trump would win.

Dear veteran trader, Nasdaq futures has been up between 2 to 4.3 percent the whole night (Biden odds were high, trump odds got high, contested election occurred).

SCOTUS can‚Äôt do anything, elections are governed by the state. You‚Äôd have to fight it in the supreme courts of each individual state. Those judges are accountable to electors. Not likely to get reelected if you decide your constituents votes shouldn‚Äôt count in a high profile election.

It's hilarious how the retards in r/politics are circlejerking malding over fake news. 

"TRUMP SAYS PLANS TO GO TO U.S. SUPREME COURT, WANTS ALL THE 'VOTING TO STOP'"

In what interpretation of English does that mean he's tossing out the mail in votes? It just reads as no more voting after the end of the day.
You and the working class agree on that point, that‚Äôs really why he won. I also just don‚Äôt like him because he‚Äôs a fucking idiot. But my voice is continuously overshadowed by suburban white girls who think that people who don‚Äôt intensively study the constantly changing vocabulary and etiquette of woke culture are literally fascists. I don‚Äôt know where the parties will even go from here. Liberals are hardly liberal anymore and trumpers are hardly even conservative anymore. It‚Äôs a sad time for our political system overall tbh

Cash gang getting nervous to get an entry. 

We pumpin
Mail-ins are coming in 3:1 in Biden's favour. There's four+ times the number of outstanding votes to the margin between winner and loser.

May want to double check that. It'll be close, and Trump can still win, but it's unlikely.
Oh they used it guy, just on themselves
Not everyone makes papers like you
I think the problem is that people vote against policies rather than for them. And a lot of lower class are voting trump because they don‚Äôt really understand those policies.
None of those parties exist anymore lol
YesüêÇ

If COVID wasn't happening we wouldn't have this though.

So because republicans don‚Äôt know what a mask is, that was reason enough to elect a dead guy? Flawless logic.

Exactly, your happiness depends solely on getting wins. How fucked in the head are you that you don't derive any gratification unless you get a "win". I feel sad for you, and I hope you keep feel like you're winning cause apparently it's very important to you to prove that you win (lmao) 

I know I should be sad, but thats because you're so messed up that you can't actually comprehend how someone can still be happy when they're not winning. To me, you're a failure of a human being - unable to show any compassion for your fellow Man if they have a different opinion than you. Though I'm sure you weren't raised with any sort of love and thats why you ended up so fucked in the head but yea stay winning or whatever you dumbfucks say.

The electoral college gives the country equal representation and is the one thing both parties agreed on when the country was founded. Imagine letting all the big cities decide the election every single year.
why is that?
The issue is not that votes wont be counted the issue is they want to count votes after the election has taken place. All votes should be counted but fundamentally changing the election process is goofy no matter which side you are rooting for. The election today was not a secret.
they know the outcome
https://www.axios.com/bloomberg-group-trump-election-night-scenarios-a554e8f5-9702-437e-ae75-d2be478d42bb.html

A top data and analytics firm says it's highly likely that President Trump will appear to have won ‚Äî potentially in a landslide ‚Äî on election night, even if he ultimately loses when all the votes are counted. 

More Democrats will vote by mail than Republicans, due to fears of the coronavirus, and it will take days if not weeks to tally these. This means Trump, thanks to Republicans doing almost all of their voting in person, could hold big electoral college and popular vote leads on election night.

-PA counts ballots received by 11/6 (currently mail ins are going 5:1 for Biden)

-NC counts ballots received by 11/12

-GA, MI, WI count ballots received by the night of 11/3 (none of these have been counted yet)

GA is a very close race with a lot of mail-ins left to count.

If you input all the current called races, Biden still has a 90% chance of winning, barring shenanigans.

We know that turnout is WAY, WAY higher than 2016 (138m votes) but so far we've only counted 130m.  This election is just getting started.  Trust the data. Not the cheez-it.
How high NIO would go?
People vote for policies.

Democratic policies are too anti middle class.
You win
Was looking at the map over 80-85% is counted and trump is rather closer in these areas. Also there are some counties only 80% counted where trump is pulling in 75-80% of the vote to offset so Biden would have to win almost 70% of the remaining vote
Tech pricing in a winner perhaps?

I mean I guess you‚Äôre right in a sense. Maybe ‚Äúwidely‚Äù isn‚Äôt the best word, but most controversial for sure. For the people that dont actually like him, they hate him, a LOT. Which obviously was shown with how much more the turnout increased with people that wanted him out. A lot of trumps success was actually BECAUSE of his against the grain personality, which frankly I think the dems could‚Äôve stolen that support by picking a candidate that matched/exceeded that same type of energy, like Bernie tbh, I think his no nonsense ‚Äúfuck the system‚Äù attitude would‚Äôve resonated a lot with the less political and more personality motivated trump supporters

I agree. I do believe we will have a president with dementia. People aren't really voting 'for' joe biden they are voting 'against' Trump.. In my opinion.

I know people who are blunt in their Mango support. They voted for Trump either for tax purposes or because they hate liberals even more than they hate Trump. But none of them are MAGA though because I don‚Äôt associate with retards who suck orange cock.

I love when people make this argument because it has absolutely zero logic at all. If anything the electoral college creates herd mentality because of the winner take all aspect to it and it lowers voter turnout. Republican votes in MA, NY, and CA don‚Äôt matter. If we switched to a popular vote then republicans in California would have their vote matter.

I hate to break it to you, but mango isn't widely unpopular. I think you just found out (again) they are just lying to you that they hate him, and when your back is turned we are throwing a Trump party.

And sorry to break it to you, they aren't causally racist, cause Trump overperformed with black and brown voters which is exactly why he won. The only people complaining Trump is a racist are white women. Maybe if you pulled away from your 2 minutes hate on your telescreen, you'd know that already.

The Nasdaq 100 has a larger growth focus with less debt and leverage while excluding more bank and industrial influences, which carry more financial leverage and debt, partially because tech stocks tend to reinvest into expansion than dispense dividends compared to the more mature, saturated stocks in the Dow. Instead of tech vs industrials, it's lean balance sheets vs leveraged ones.
i'm still confuse, the market rally on orange win or sleepy win?
It's interesting actually trading the futures at 3am.. 

I guess regular options traders can't do anything until 930am.. But futures traders can trade this all night..

A common example of IV crush is after a company reports earnings, once numbers come out there usually isn‚Äôt a catalyst for a huge move anymore, so IV drops significantly.

Basically your option contract is worth less because the stock is less likely to have a big move. What drives the degree of the change in IV is what the market is pricing in for earnings/election etc

coz it has been trash for like 3 years lol joke
Trump = Corona dominates = Tech continues to outperform.
The opposite actually. They wanted to stop them counting ballots coming in late. Supreme court threw it out
Bulls saying this a bear trap have probably no idea about politics 

Trump. Declaring victory and saying there is voter fraud IS A BAD THING FOR THE MARKET. 

Basically, it implies he knows Biden will win after all the mail in ballots are counties thus more instability until they‚Äôre also accounted for.
How is it 2020 and there is still no optimal method of counting votes? Are we using an abacus?

I bought tesla pre split at 42$ sold at 51$ day before it jumped 50% so ya that's atleast 100k.
That's the whole idea behind America's electoral college system instead of a popular vote. It gives states some power in the process. A big metro like SF, LA or NY can't control the election. Why not, you ask? It fights against the "herd mentality" where everyone just votes what their neighbor votes for without actually doing the research.
Futures mooning on knowing trump has officially won. There you go guys
Especially the last one ‚ù§Ô∏è
Politics would be a whole lot easier if a trump supporter wouldn‚Äôt argue outside their realm of reasoning for support. For example, if you voted for Trump because you are a racist, then instead of trying to discuss politics, just say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a racist, and that‚Äôs my reason for voting‚Äô or ‚ÄòI like owning machine guns, and that‚Äôs my reason for voting‚Äô.

It would definitely save a lot of arguments; since when it comes to politics, he has and will continue to do anything to fuck over the country for his own personal gain.
This has been discussed for weeks. Months even.

If the roles were swapped Biden would've been declared the winner on these numbers alone. Why are they declaring AZ for Biden with 20% votes left but PA MI GA and WI are still in play
Its going to end up that we will have 8 of the past 9 general elections where democrats took the popular vote, 3 of those 8 republicans won anyway, and 2 of those 3 were contested elections decided by the supreme court.

Whichever party benefits is really irrelevant to the point that the Electoral College is destroying our democracy one election at a time
I feel like with how widely unpopular mango has been this could‚Äôve been a landslide victory for the dems. Have they considered maybe, I don‚Äôt know, being better at politics? Like you really couldn‚Äôt find a super likeable, lively, appealing moderate? You know you have no clue what you‚Äôre doing as a party when you repeatedly fail miserably at getting minority votes while so many republicans continue to be casually racist.

Yeah lmk when your wife is free
interesting. appreciate the explanation.
Yeah there are, but it‚Äôs going to come down to Michigan and PA. Trump can split them with Biden and win. Biden needs both of them. If Biden comes back in Georgia I‚Äôd be shocked but I guess it‚Äôs possible with the early voting but most of the vote has been counted so unlikely

Dude you know 16 year olds would be posting tic tok videos of themselves like eating the ballots or some shit with some tag like "yolo" or " I swallowed daddy trump"

After watching those kids lick ice cream in stores and put it back at the start of the pandemic I feel that all children have reached peak autist levels
And you're doing what now exactly?

Mods!!
I think it‚Äôs all the liberals buying tech because they think Biden has it and will make sure to lock us all for for another 5 years

PA has a rule, they can‚Äôt count mail ballots till after polls close, they had millions to count. There is no way they can count them all in a few hrs

Why is dow and spy features red though ??
i will try
I wonder why
The driver isn't really option demand but instead expectation. If the buyer and seller traded expecting a 5% move the whole duration and the stock only got a 2.5% move during the main event, the expectation the stock would move the remaining 2.5% without the big event is suddenly orders of magnitude lower and therefore the option will be priced as the now degenerate gamble it suddenly became for the remainder of the time.
https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/11/04/joe-biden-speech-wilmington-delaware-elexnight-vpx.cnn

I had to rewatch his speech just to address your point:

@00:25 -> Im here to tell you tonight we believe we are on track to win this election. We knew because of the unprecedented early vote, mailed in vote...

Then, he proceeded to list the states he feels really confident about. 

Sure, he did say it's not his place or trump's to declare victory, but with what he said beforehand, he basically declared victory for himself.

Now can I get a proper response from you?

When Trump was young, he was getting regularly fked in the ass by Roy Cohn, a gay Jewish power broker back in the day. That's why Trump will bend over whenever Netanyahu asks him for anything.

You are an idiot. Election isn‚Äôt over until votes are counted. The US has never decided an election based on the speed that votes are counted and elections have never been finalized on election night.

I didn‚Äôt bother waiting for that I just clicked on for each speech and clicked back out. There is nothing to report in a divided nation unless there is a sweep. Which doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case as it‚Äôs a divided nation.

Votes are counted after Election Day in every single presidential election are you serious? They never officially confirm the vote until days after.
At first I hated this comment, but then I took a deep breath and slowly upvoted it.
now she wanna a butt liftü•∂
Trump... Doing the right thing? Jesus fuck. He has the country bent over biting the pillow right now. Maybe that‚Äôs how you like it.
lol "trump asks for a recount" is putting the shitstorm that would ensue in the nicest term possible. He's going to claim the entire democratic process is rigged.
Too early to tell. Wait til normies wake up and see the highlight reel premarket

Do tell, do tell. My bearish handbook is written in faded unconfident ink. What's the plan?
Basically trump needs to win EITHER Michigan or PA, but Biden needs them both to win. Trumps taking GA, WI, and NC no way Biden‚Äôs not coming back in GA. Outlook good for mango odds are in his favor I think.

ES is /ES or E-mini S&P futures. It's the same pricing as SPX which is roughly close to 10x SPY
I don‚Äôt think Trump‚Äôs advisors really understand how the legal system works. They have by far the worst record for legal challenges for and against of any administration at all levels of the federal court system. Also them thinking this retarded absentee ballot play will come close to even seeing SCOTUS is laughable.
They‚Äôre not open yet tho. Right?
Priority one is evening out the book so they carry no risk. If you have enough money you can move the book simply by betting one side.
Mango being a fucking lunatic retard was already priced in?
You are a special type of smooth brains aren't you. The ballots are in, but some states cannot start counting a zillion ballots until when the polls close. Other places get a ton of ballots dropped off on election day even when law allows tabulation as received. Some states have laws that ballots just need to be postmarked by election day (just like the irs doesn't require your return on the deadline, just postmarked by the deadline). Whether you like it or not doesn't matter, the law is the fucking law in each state.
Check futures, there‚Äôs still a chance
u play CFD?
I'm not worried either way. I'm just sitting here watching both sides treat this like life or death and both sides threaten some "civil war" and it just seems like an over-reaction.
I mean the fact that CEO‚Äôs have daughters who grow up to be heroin shooting up whores or sons who grow up to be homeless meth addicts kinda shows that even though you might have everything it doesn‚Äôt take away the pain that is being human.

The election is over and people are playing games.   GA: "A pipe burst!"  PA: "You really expect me to count all these right now?!"  AZ: "Those 1 million votes aren't going to make a difference, Biden won!" MI: "Can't call it, there's some ballots blowing down 8 mile right now!"

Its the same thing i did when.i had to write an essay when i was 10. Use alot of words to say nothing.
Does the % votes counted include mail-in ballots or not? E.g. GA - the 8% not counted, are those in-person votes or in-person plus mail?
Me bro... balls deep in QQQ puts
Yeah. Low energy, looks like Mango's energy has run out. He needs more cocaine probably.
If anyone is wondering, the US president threatening to refuse to accept election results is worth exactly 22 minutes of market panic
Mail in ballots were 1,600,000 Democrats 600,000 Republicans.
My calls are green as far as I‚Äôm concerned. If I lose money, I‚Äôll bring in the Supreme Court

Alright. I'll sleep in then
Then that‚Äôs fucking fine and it will be the result once the votes are counted but as long as we live in a democratic republic people don‚Äôt just get announce they won the presidency when they haven‚Äôt

I can‚Äôt remember where I read it. But markers want gridlock. 

Markets do better when the congress and White House are split between different parties because it means gridlock and no new regulations or laws constraining the market.
Oh 100% let‚Äôs make this fucking $$$$
Options cover a specific period of time, but risk that is concentrated in a direct point in time has to be approximated in the options pricing which distorts the standard ratios that go into pricing. Once the risk event occurs, the remaining time in the options has to quickly reconfigure to a lower risk level. Edit like buying tornado insurance when the sirens are ringing. Once the tornado is over and the sirens stop, your one-day insurance isn't worth much anymore
So this is gonna be some 3 week limbo?
why did you do that?

My QQQ puts are fucked no matter what
Id say Wisconsin Michigan and Georgia...no way PA going blue at this point
Then fuck off.
Trump is not good for markets, he is not good for anyone. The sooner he gets out the better America will be
Neither stock moved at all after hours, kinda weird
Maybe 5 am
That‚Äôs original but no. Trump may talk out of his ass but does the right thing while Biden will smooth talk that 12‚Äù dildo up your ass so well you won‚Äôt even feel it. Enjoy those hemorrhoids
Why didn‚Äôt Trump just declare he won before any of the votes were counted?
Yeah, they just lost their little kid plug and need to find a new one.
Europe straight fucking collapsing lmfao
What are they going to say the next 4 years...
need 270 to win
GTBIF is printing for me
But hey, we are still here.

Were you aware that in my states, including PA, it was republicans that put regulations in place that didn't allow them to count mail in ballots ahead of time?

If anything it was rigged specifically so trump could try and claim the mail in ballots are invalid.
Yes

I don't give a shit about the rest of the market, but I really need these AMC 4c 11/6 to hit like bad or I'm gonna be on the street corner sucking dicks for corndogs.
It‚Äôs really bizarre watching the biases in real time when they can‚Äôt even affect votes. Crazy
I mean you should look into it because it‚Äôs pretty interesting and shady. Not every state typically has mail voting for the masses, and those that did typically say they can‚Äôt open those ballots until voting day (the more hands they touch the worse). Most states recognized that there will be major mail in voting numbers and tried to pass laws to count it or sort it earlier so it‚Äôs tallied on time. Dem law makers tended to pass this, republics not so much. so these states that are still counting were purposely put in a difficult position to count them rapidly.
These days we have an anti-Union left and a pro-deficit right, and I don't know what the fuck is happening anymore
He doesn‚Äôt need that tool to contest the election. He thinks any vote for dems is voter fraud lol. And that‚Äôs enough evidence for the cult.
Yeah. That alone is really suspect. It‚Äôs prolly just massive incompetence but there is no way to look at that and not see all the chaos on the horizon. God man, I hope I wake up and somehow it is all sorted out but I am afraid for the coming days. Anyways, Ima try to get some sleep, maybe best you do too

Imagine if lil yachty ran for pres... the market would implode
Agreed. He's got Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina in the bag. Even if Biden somehow overcomes Trump's enormous lead in Philadelphia it would still be a trump victory. Some real out of the left field shit needs to happen to swing the odds in Bidens favor.

Trump had a problem with AZ being called for Biden when he was down 6 points but in tighter races he thinks those should be called for him because he was ahead. ü§î

exactly my thinking too. It looks like a trump victory right now,  but we also have a massively new amount of mail ballots that we dont really know the exact amount of, and a shitty US postal service that isnt equipped to handle that right now. I dont know what to expect.

Biden wins AZ

Just watched the mango press and he looks like he‚Äôs seething.

he made a fucking awful speech google it

Except the polls already attributed the mail in ballots to Biden and in the states where trump has a substantial lead 89-95% of votes are in. Mathematically mail in ballots couldn‚Äôt flip it. Something is fishy
? it passed it didn't fail
so markets want üò¥ joe
I guess i should go to sleep? They‚Äôll probably call NV and we have to wait for everything else
they wanted it to pass
Now trump is only up 108k votes in Wisconsin with 224k votes left and 102k in Georgia with 301k votes left holy shit trump
Seriously, not reported tomorrow will be Russia moving deeper into Eastern Europe and the middle east, China encroaching Taiwan and smashing Hong Kong, and every tinpot dictator in the third world sending out their next genocide squads.  America stubbed his toe and is gonna be howling for months.

I would probably Stop dreaming and wake up
If üò¥ wins im out. I lose enough money without the government taxing half of the peanuts i get.
AZ is Biden now

He‚Äôs basically fucked unless most mail ins are for him

So he‚Äôs fucked
He can just take this to the Supreme Court and they'll fix this problem. and if you don't like it, you can move to Canada
Even worse, one night in 4 years lmao

no volatility here, nothing to see
Didn‚Äôt they spend millions on making sure it passed?
Not a chance. And I have uvxy calls as well lol.
I don't really blame him, the "polling" was calling for a landslide victory for Biden.
[deleted]
There's still enough outstanding votes for Joe Biden to win and many of the outstanding votes are mail-in votes (which democrats seem to have used more often).
Some of you are beta cucks, lets be honest.
States were decided earlier because it wasn‚Äôt as close so the need to count every vote wasn‚Äôt there.
Anything could really happen. Wouldn't surprise me
He just lost Arizona and Maine according to AP
Uber and Lyft shelled tens of millions of advertising dollars for this prop 22 win. Happy for you call holders, but these companies gotta be stopped at some point
Were you aware that in my states it was republicans that put regulations in place that didn't allow them to count mail in ballots ahead of time?

I‚Äôd rather a have a big mouth president than a career corrupt politician
I‚Äôm still praying for a miracle
I dont think Georgia is seriously in play, but those Northern States got to be the biggest blue balls Ive seen. Those idiots knew they were important to the election as well. Oklahoma not reporting? That's fine. Nobody cares. Pennsylvania and Michigan though? What the fuck? There was plenty of time to change whatever rules stop them from counting right away
Do u guys think my baba calls are good??
Nah, the Wendys corner is already being served by your mum
Didn't expect that big, but thought there was at least a decent chance we'd have a useful results
Not based on registration
If Sleepy üò¥ wins, that means PRPL and other mattress companies moon?
So Uber and Lyft gonna go bankrupt cause 22 passed in CA

Jk I‚Äôm retarded
AZ is going Biden. If Trump loses GA he‚Äôll need to sweep the rust belt
Bulls and Bears are stressed lol.
You'd like that wouldn't you?
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll still have anything in the call area (tech) by morning, next 48 hours gonna be rough
Exactly, and the fact that Trump will contest a loss to the death.
all the morons here thinking Biden won you can literally go on a betting website right now and get a 200% return. Put all your money in !

No. It‚Äôs a toss up but looks like it‚Äôs leaning Biden
Better then someone who rethinks everything he's gonna say in public.
And there wasn't a pandemic 4 years ago where you have a ton of states who had a giant surge in mail in voting with states who don't deal with that much mail in voting. 

4 years ago there were states who did not have every vote counted on election day but they weren't consequential to the electorial map.

ABC about biden
Politics aside, if ü•≠ loses I'm gonna miss all the WSB memes. üòî Joe just doesn't have the same meme potential.
Was about throw 2k on fd calls 2 minutes before close when a customer called me and lost the chance. Thank you whiny customer, free flesh light on me
afraid of scotus?
Will my icln calls moon
The official North Carolina website has already reported 100% of the votes are in and declared trump the victor. But the media isn‚Äôt reporting it. Go look on their website for yourself
tbf fox was too. fox called VA for biden while trump was still leading. Also the early Arizona call ofc.
What ever happened to smart people being able to thrive under any presidency? Look at all the terrible presidents in the past, and how many people succeeded in the past to get where they are today. If you're reliant on someone in office to make you succeed in life, then you're not part of the upper echelon. Biden or Trump doesn't matter; smart people are going to keep making money either way.

That insane Trump speech at 2:30 am is what shit the bed. Markets hate uncertainty. Trump wants to stop counting and go right to lawyers. Futures crashed because of that.
Also Trump? Lol...
[deleted]
Votes cast before polls close and counted before polls close are two different things. Many states still allow voting if you‚Äôre in line by the cut-off time too.
Nobody ‚Äústopped the election‚Äù, it takes time to count the mail in ballots, that‚Äôs all. There are A LOT more of them due to COVID and higher turnout in general.
[deleted]
Nailed it.
Sad to say but looks like the Cheeto is staying
People really not seeing through the bullshit and realizing Trump's advisors are pissed over Arizona because its gonna end up deciding the election? Wild
There is no lets see how scotus plays it. Every person with half a brain knows trump has no chance. 

If scotus even entertains it , pretty much the most unprecedented thing in american history and guranteeing some type of civil war.
yea if its that in public, then behind closed doors its going to be him reverse cosplaying a lizard while she docks her strap-on rocket in his love socket

you know im right
Yea thats stupid. I understand all votes need to be counted bumming if states get close we could call it. Like there not like 10 millions votes still encounter to the polls. 70 or more are there. If the margin of error like less than 2 or so shit. You could call it.
My thought is some initial thoughts that clear winner would be decided with FL going early for trump.
Did orange man tell supporters to vote in person specifically so that he‚Äôd have this tool of contesting mail-in ballots if the polls weren‚Äôt looking so hot? That way, he doesn‚Äôt screw himself over.

Idfk
Only thing they can contest is how it was counted and handled on an individual basis. 

They‚Äôd then have to go through each ballot and find as many issues as they can in order to invalidate
dictator Trump good for markets
I disagree, oral presentation the most important.
Then you‚Äôre about to learn a hard lesson in statistics
Trump leading in all swing states but Nevada. Why is there a debate on who‚Äôs gonna win!?
Better than getting brain washed by FOX propoganda
Back to ripping, calls are saved
NIO TO 5M
It‚Äôs because he just said fuck the election and wants the Supreme Court to stop the counting. Which means the market now expects him to contest this election.
Sure is. I‚Äôve done a good amount to math on the outstanding votes. Trump is more likely to win given the ratio Biden needs is really unrealistic tbh. Even so, you never know, and Pen could also do weird shit which would make it deciding if by some insane chance the stars are defied in four states at once. Even so, say Trump wins in all of them. Given the weird shit this night and how close it was, the chance of it being taken peacefully is basically 0. And if Biden wins? It will look like fraud because voting suspended on what would be called usually and with the argument in the courts about voting. Idk man. Shit is dangerous af and terrifying
God I hope so, my puts would print. The court cases would go till January.
They do not, unless it's over Zoom, or they're a cat.
you can literally go on a betting site and bet for Biden to win PA and get a 350% return. All these morons downvoting should put all their money in
well it‚Äôs literally good for healthcare and oil stocks so...

It‚Äôs possible. Far as fuck certain and arguably better for Biden. Even if he loses GA (which is close) Trump needs to win AZ and 2 out of 3 of MI, WI, and PA.
Exactly, that's why I always said why would you want Trump to lose. That market going to tank into the Earth if Trump loses with the promo he cuts.
Live it up but be careful guy
Uhhh except the threat of a total culture war in America? I mean the implications if trump wins are so vast that not only the stock market would plummet but democratic practices as a whole will. (If he wins off of a Supreme Court decision)
This is true
Just chill bro he‚Äôs probably going to come out tomorrow and be like ‚Äúmy bad, keep counting‚Äù and we‚Äôre back at where we were.
Someone update me why did NQ futures rally 5% before falling? Is Trump seen as a bit less likely to win now?

We talked about whats going to happen for the last year depending on who wins...
hard to say. SC justices are supposed to be the most honorable and non-partisan of all of the govt. That being said, it seems Trump is well ahead in all of the key states so I don't get why all this drama - shouldn't it be settled tomorrow with Trump wins in states he is ahead in and Biden win in AZ and Nevada? That should put Trump in a victory.

let‚Äôs see how scotus plays it , no ???
Again it's individual to each news station and doesn't matter anyway. And I wouldn't say GA or NC are guaranteed yet anyway, the remaining votes are all mail in ballots in heavy urban areas.
Not everyone lives in AK an Hawaii
I swear someone said it was all Trump just 30 mins ago. Are they also just as poor at prediction as we are?
ATL and surrounding counties votes aren‚Äôt in rn....

Do you understand how many votes that is? And how many mail in ballots in PA are waiting to be counted.
Wouldn't it be funny if the mail in ballots were like 55-45 Biden and nowhere near enough to swing anything üòÅ

they don't use reported number of votes, because they don't have those (because early, mail, and other forms of voting). It's an estimate.
the election was today. after that its over. simple

if they wanted the votes counted then they should have counted them instead of going home

game over
PA couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to stay up counting and went to bed hours ago.
THAT SUMBITCH DID IT AGAIN!
More of Radegast.
Yeah im wondering why Democrats are centered around urban cities. Does they get more weight on their votes? Is it fair that cityfolk are represented more than the majority of the US?
Im ignorant how? You realize these millions of ballots were sent in BEFORE election day right?

Do you have brain damage? Its all political theatre, even the 100% republican scotus will fucking LAUGH at trump for this clownery.
I didn't even know I could short $mangoes

But I did not expect to get THIS drunk

Jack Daniels, you are a magician, my sir
I mean, like I never even visualized that Biden would be president. In my mind Trump was President the next four years anyway. I think this is a V.R. simulation. Just go with it.
we had an overnight limit down as it was becoming clear Trump was winning then markets suddenly reversed and mooned hours later

I was actually holding several ES longs at the time, almost dumped them but luckily i didn't

Was going to buy XOM calls if Trump won and XOM puts if Biden won.

Now I'm just going to scream.
Yes
Not even lol
Well, if you use exit poll numbers and an aggregation based system yeah. Not if you count reported number of votes cast after close and numbers counted
Naa Republicans will change their tune on a dime
Guys if we have to fight a civil war, can we have an age limit on presidency? Maybe like 60? I‚Äôm tired of senile old people running our country.
I mean, he's not bald, or smart, buuut
What numbers retard

Biden won Arizona

He just needs PA or one of the other blue states. 

Trump r fuk
I think it‚Äôs very much possible ORANGE man suspects a lot of the swing states currently favoring him have a big chance of swinging into Biden‚Äôs favor after they count the record amounts of mail in ballots which are upwards of 3 million. 

Market senses this and will start to tank. There‚Äôs a reason futures is tumbling right now. Investors are aware of this and don‚Äôt want to be caught with their pants down.
I usually hate everything about CNN but I watched them all night until the lost their shit after the trump speech.
He would have to take 68% of the remaining vote to take Georgia. Its possible, but I feel like that is a tall task.
Are people here pissed because the president of the United States doesn't believe in democracy or because he tanked their calls?

P.S.
Dictators around the world must be absolutely enjoying this shit show. America can't take the moral high ground on international issues anymore.
Markets were going up with a resolution, now there isn't one until end of November.
Puts on IWM is better than puts on SPY if you believe the market is going to crash.
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being serious lol
I agree, and no matter who wins a lot is going to go tits up before the end. Just wanted to state that because that wasn‚Äôt the reason trump threatened to go to scotus
States accept votes postmarked today beyond poll closure.
[deleted]
None of our state ran media channels are decent. YouTube is the way.
I‚Äôm about to go to sleep very comfortable with 4 more years of trump you should be very fucking worried about how your barely functioning brain is gonna handle 4 more years of Trump ‚Äúhurting ur feelings‚Äù
Yeah NJ passed legal MJ for what it‚Äôs worth, not sure if you‚Äôre in USOs or Canadian companies
FFS, you realize that people have to sleep, right? They can't ask people to pull a 24 hour shift and go zombie during critical vote counting process. In PA for example they aren't even allowed to open envelopes until the polls closed by law. You know how long it takes to open a million envelopes and feed them thru a machine with a 200 people doing that?

Every election has some states that don't have all votes tabulated until following day. This is just even more the case because of the pandemic and everyone said this was to be expected for the last 2 months.
He's pretty much got PA in the bag no doubt
did bernie also say that scotus involvement? shooting out lukewarm takes isn‚Äôt some mind blowing concept. maybe for a retard monkey like u ??

and i‚Äôm talking about TRUMP. ur actually so ignorant
[deleted]
Lol
[deleted]
I know for the safety and sanctity of everyone they have to stop his broadcasting.  But if they let him get a few more lines in. We'll be bungee jumping without the cord right now.

Quite possibly the best possible outcome. VXX calls print, sold SQQQ calls today for a small loss, and tech calls tomorrow print.
Sucking dick doesn‚Äôt require an interview
Yup
ahh kk makes sense then
they've gone out of the way to not call 4 states for T he's clearly going to win but Biden gets his cock sucked up down left and right
We just can't decide a winner.. looks like we'll have to give it to this little boy. He says his name is Damien.
Yeah, that‚Äôs fair. I was simplifying a bit. I genuinely dislike this whole situation. Shit makes me anxious. I wish things were initial and hugely defensive rather then dancing around the fire like this. Feels on the edge af
Trump is this you?
Good point. But we all kinda knew that, so get more ppl to count let wtf.
Yup. Bulls feelin stressed af daily
it‚Äôs down big on insider PM. not always accurate but a good sense of direction before pm open
GUH!!
Could a circuit breaker negatively impact stocks?
It could & it will
How you figure that lol? Trump gonna sweep Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania
Sick as fuck bro I love civil unrest
He can't win PE, he has bone spurs.
Haha sounds good. ü§ùü§ù


Let‚Äôs see what I can come up with.
lol
Yup it passed. But ur too late. Uber and lyft should get a nice pump at open. Ur gonna get iv crushed if u jump in tmrw
Not watched, but what the flip? 2020 is so surreal
Europe dumping haaaaard!
Funny how Trump talked about ‚Äòdraining the swamp‚Äô when it appears the majority of his base live in, or next to, a swamp lol.
Most people that sent in mail ballots are old republicans. Most younger people went out and voted
And democrats are still like ‚Äúthe economy is not what matters right now‚Äù

Why the fuck are we in this situation?
Yooo get this fucking orangutan out of office now please
Great üëçüëç
you are a fucking retard.

where has bernie sanders ever said that mail in votes should not be counted? i have the clip in front of me. he says 'all votes should be counted'
Wish I knew what to set my sell order to so I don't have to wake up early.
> It is shady. 

Lol the 100% is based on the predicted number of votes. A number above 100 just means more people voted than was expected. Go back to class
Lol
You and your logic
Or Microsoft 200!
Not much SCOTUS can do, you would have to fight it in each state‚Äôs supreme court. It‚Äôs just algos selling off without knowing that is not how the US government works.
You made that clear when you voted for crazy joe
Stay mad üòò
"A few different routes to victory."

under very extreme and narrow margins
Can‚Äôt imagine how much stress Bulls are under rn. Trump can turn the entire week red with just a few sentences
Or live in India and get a free bottle of alcohol for your vote

GA and PA might go Biden‚Äôs way. Very real possibility. So it‚Äôs way too close.
I‚Äôm starting to think Shepard Smith is a android
true. it was green big PM before it drilled yesterday. possibly the opposite ? but idk i feel it‚Äôs a buy the rumor sell the news situation. legalizing weed was almost guaranteed
He‚Äôs losing either NC or GA.  If he loses either of those he needs PA, MI, and WI.  It‚Äôs a lot still.
GA is anything but Nevada üòÇ

It doesn‚Äôt help that this situation is also perfect for the political theater mantra being pushed in this country for as long as I‚Äôve been born. I am convinced something like this will happen.
2% difference with 7% still out
Joe says his dead son won a senate race. What a liar
Basically, a few states previously reporting 100% of the votes cast had another 9% to tally then stopped at a small percentage remaining where it looked like trump would win. Biden needs 60-65% or so across them. Trump gave a speech saying he will get the Supreme Court involved since it is obviously suspect. Then... here we are now.
You‚Äôre fake news
Imagine thinking the IV crush would come the day after the elections
Imagine if the score becomes 269 - 269 and TSLA also hits 420 on that same day

The entire universe would literally reach quantum singularity

Have had several 3-4 day benders with them. Alot of good times. Was super comfortable on em but now thinking about doing them again after 4 years or so it makes me sort of anxious aha I don't like it
The market rarely leaves itself open to completely obvious moves, but this was one of those times. Never was a chance in hell this election was decided quickly and smoothly. Last 2 days were last ditch attempt to try and shake people out, and I'm so happy I chose being miserable all day instead of cutting my losses
They were up more than 3.5% earlier though
[deleted]
Because humans sleep. Stop doing meth.

Let's face it everyone that voted for any of these two dudes is a clown at this point. Whole system is laughing in our faces and we have to pick.

1 percent of them are rich and don't give a fuck about anything but their paper. 49% believe they're gonna be rich(er), and join the bandwagon. 50% are just idiots that don't realize they're eating dinner from a fucking dollar store and voting for a guy who eats their annual income in a week. They don't realize they're voting to defund their education to breed more idiots and they don't realize that the other 50% is just weaponizing them as idiots. And even some of these idiots eventually ask the right questions and realize they're idiots... So they pridefully justify whatever they thought they were right about, or whatever Daddy Orange says so they don't look stupid and aren't ostracized by the idiots around them.
It doesn't matter if they call it, the 6% will still be counted. Calling it is seperate to every news outlet too, just be patient my man. It's nothing official anyway
What's been funny is CNN actually before this was pretty fair for once
i never watch US medias, is abc a decent channel?
Of course not. I voted biden but he's retarded. Both side fucking sucks. It's just that this whole distrust in mail in ballots is silly.
he said further votes after polls closed should not be counted. i have zero clue how u could misconstrue his words. it‚Äôs being sent to scotus u fucking uneducated disinforming piece of retard shit
such original and creative content

thanks for your contribution

Anyways SPY calls tomorrow because fuck it dude idk.
This type of attitude is why Hillary lost.
Mail in ballots haven‚Äôt been counted yet pal. Don‚Äôt get too confident
I understand not all votes maybe received today that got mailed. But like I would 70% of mail ballots are already at their district. My point is, how is the counting being down slower. If anything it be faster
browser must been lagging dawg
So aside from exposing latent mental health issues, that's a, "in no way whatsoever".
it wasnt abrubt, the supreme court ruled they can vote late including absentee ballots. Biden has 70% leads in 2 NC counties that still have around 12% of votes left to count in each. GA is in the same boat, but with a couple more counties.

& also, a devry university math degree doesnt rly count ;)
Yeah true. March 50% off sale then JPOW plugged in the printer and we rode the gravy train to tendy town. Just some election frights rn that‚Äôll smooth over real quick
Weed was climbing on account of Joe being favored, not gonna lie, sweating these ACB puts ATM

lol what the fk did I do? It's an honest question. I've been watching Bloomberg's coverage and they've never mentioned CA yet.
It was the republicans that wouldn‚Äôt let the early votes be opened before this morning.. you can‚Äôt come up with the rules and then complain about the rules lol
CA is already countedü§£
Not surprising.
"Well yeah, that's what happens when you just... stop counting. Trump is saying he's taking it to the Supreme Court to get them to *finish fucking counting the ballots*. "

&#x200B;

The mental gymnastics conservatives do to justify the dumb shit that spews out of their favorite flavor of spray tan's mouth.
It‚Äôs mostly democrats that do mail in. So take that as you will
CA so blue, they make living there expensive to force people to move to other states and turn those blue as well like AZ.
I mean, these next few days are gonna feel like weeks so I think it's pretty accurate

He actually doesn't. Surprising fact about Trump. Doesn't drink because his brother had an alcohol-related death
Explode up with Trump, explode down with Biden (since senate will still be republican). Biden with a republican senate means no stimulus because "fiscal responsibility."

bernie sanders has literally called this exact process from months back.

republicans will be winning wisconsin , pa and michigan in the early stages because republicans do irl voting and dems do mail in voting. trump declares victory, and then mail ballots come in and we see that joe biden wins these places. trump declares fraud 

well trumps already declared it a fraud, but yea its playing out EXACTLY what he said. fucking I N S A NE

Have the media pre-counted CA and the other commie states? Bloomberg has Biden at 235. If they haven't pre-counted CA's 55 electoral votes, that would mean 290 for Biden if CA goes blue.
No, NIO is based on China
Well yeah, that's what happens when you just... stop counting. Trump is saying he's taking it to the Supreme Court to get them to *finish fucking counting the ballots*.
This is the correct take! Selling 50% min of holdings of USA companies. Trump's speech was the most dangerous speech of my life time
Joe
We need a power sharing agreement. Trump is President on Mon, Wed, and Fri, Biden on Tues, Thurs, and Sat., and each guy does a 12-hour shift on Sunday.   Less hostility, none of this winner-take all stuff.
Not statistically probable. I am pretty mathy, (getting a math degree soon) Biden would need roughly 60.9-68.4% of all remaining votes. Possible, but not probable. If anything shutting down the counting so abruptly with such a little withstanding in NC just further makes things look shady and will fuel division.
Those same people believe he went to Vietnam too

Hopefully the only thing that comes out of this Trump speech is that they count those fucking votes as fast as possible.  They have all of those millions of fucking votes to count in PA and MI, and the states say that they're stopping at 10 and reconvening tomorrow?  Then they say the votes won't be in until Friday?  What the fuck is that?

If you have a job that's important (which election worker certainly should be) you should be able to work an all-nighter if circumstances call for it.  I guarantee you that these states will won't let their results hang until fucking Friday.  Fuck that.

Stop votes from being counted when he is ahead means he wins. It's just bluster, there is no law on how fast or slow states must count votes and the power to regulate each states election procedure lies with each state. All that is required is the electors certified their electorial votes by the deadline. What happens before then is no business of the SC.
18.5 million shares is statistical noise. The Jacobs are completely, mentally out of the picture in regard to QCOMs future. Paul's off chasing some French tail after a messy divorce many years ago and the only relevant thing they're doing is XCOM which is a joke.

Europe about to dump even more into this uncertainty
NIO obviously
Baba
It‚Äôs 2020 it could happen
I just can't even fathom how 60 million people voted for this fascist piece of shit.

Do that many people really like getting tied up and having a tiny cock slapped in their face?
All I ask for is to take senate majority away from McConnell
I honestly read that as this ejaculation feels like forever
Poles
But they haven‚Äôt counted a bunch of Biden mail in ballots
welcome
Tech calls also looking solid
He initially spelled it "Poles" then deleted and reposted ü§£
A lot of mail in ballots haven't been counted in a lot of remaining states. A LOT of mail in ballots. It's looking like a lot of red leaning states got through their in-person voting all at once, but mail-in votes, which were urged by democrats are in the middle of being counted, or haven't arrived yet, and based on how many were sent and returned, we know a lot haven't been counted.
Trump in his gucci robe planning his speech
Trump ain‚Äôt popular or gonna get the electoral talking bout he‚Äôs gonna take it to court. Remember in history class everyone hated Mussolini for starting a coup. Well here it is

Financial capital of Germany. I wanna do a year abroad there. Went once when I was 16, place is superb.


Edit: I read that as Frankfurt. However, I did live for a month a bit south of Stuttgart and the superb part still stands. Long night.
You barely even addressed what I said. Point out where I‚Äôm wrong instead of spouting unrelated bullshit and then acting like you made some solid point. The President has many many many faults. However, in this one particular case the news twisted and deliberately misunderstood what he said to fit a narrative. 

I watched it fucking happen.
Economy:

First 4 years Obama/Biden market gains: 66.5% - dealt with the recession and a ton of global crisis

First 4 years of Mango market gains: 44% stopping the longest bull run in history given to him

Only morons think Mango is good for anything let alone the economy. All healthcare premiums skyrocketed and all our consumer goods became more expensive due to tariffs we pay.

Each year his trade war and failed dipshittery costs each American an additional 12,500
Give it some time
I know I called some of y'all bitches, retards, small dck cunts, pussies etc etc but um .. we still friends right?

Was gonna buy a gun but bought FDs instead
Just woke up and this shit is still going on
i genuinely want to know though because now it will bother me - why did it ever reach that level?
Leaving all the personal emotions and his personality  aside  , Trump‚Äôs mismanagement of Covid just this year was a administrative failure of epic proportion the country has never seen before ..

Get re-elected or almost re-elected , Not sure if this will happen in any other First World country..
Look at how nice futures are. They‚Äôre waiting for the europoors to wake up before they really dump.
Burn bitch burn!!!
YO THIS GUYS PRO FASCISM LETS GOOOO FUCK YEA BABY. Maybe we should count the 10+ million votes out there before we say stupid shit like this.
Gotta watch the IV as well. I‚Äôm a bear but I sold out yesterday. Market still has 6hrs til open so anything can happen.
My ACA insurance premium went up $150 to $550 a month when he removed the individual mandate. That was cool.
You, and people like you are the reason we're seeing four more years.
#was trump just flaunting the fraud thing so when he wins there is a massive moonship? üåö

‚ÄúSee? See? Business likes me‚Äù
He just wants to stop the counting while he's ahead. There's no legal reason to throw away votes they haven't had enough time to count yet.
Dude is a prick but he has made me money as well.
Not sure what you're arguing exactly, but essentially aren't mail in ballots and voting in person the same exact thing? Literally both have to be counted physically. You think some fucking USPS mailman will be ripping open each vote and changing them? At least in an amount that matters? Why can't some fuck collecting the ballot box at the end of the day do the same thing with in person voting? It's not that ballots can't manipulated, it's that it can't be done in a way that matters.
Dems have the House, they‚Äôd only have senate and even that‚Äôs only by 1 or 2 seats it looks like
yes sir as u can see here i accurately called the bottom and well now ride this shit till it um ‚Äúmoons‚Äù
Tossing this out there bush and gore didn't get decided till December 6th.

You called a contested election? Lol you and literally everyone else
He ruined my relationship with my dad even though i don't care about either side im considered an obamalover in his head .Just  because i tell him to change the subject sometimes so i get the "yeah you obamalovers arent so happy anymore?"
Dems still control the House. The Senate will be close as well, still undecided.
Def no unless you can hold for a few weeks
Oh jeez, yea you‚Äôre fucked
House picks President and senate picks VP
AZ blue
And MSNBC is fucking imploding, your point?
Was trying to figure out why WSB seems so soyboy libtarded tonight, but then I remembered most of the people here are in high school/college getting brainwashed by teachers with liberal arts degrees, on top of reddit being a anti-trump echo chamber to begin with.

e: look below for dem tears and liberal art majors trading their life savings of $2,500
This really isnt the worst case scenario as the election still hasn't been decided yet. If later today trump wins GA,WI,MI, and NC which he leads all he'll end up winning the election
seems like he might be worried about the results in PA and such... just my guess

Its retail right? What do people do when they get anxious, they shop.
I put a lot of effort and time into this. I accused others of being wrong, I accused others of being blinded. I am questioning is it them or me? Is it neither? Perhaps its all perspective. One thing I know for sure is I have no power and my thoughts and effort are time fillers as life dwindles away. Maybe I should have just 'watched' the show and spent more of my effort enjoying time with my family and taking in life's beautiful mysteries and wonderment rather than getting wrapped up in all this. When I die I won't regret spending more time on an election but I will regret not loving my family and life more.. Maybe it's not too late to re-evaluate...
Dude, go to bed.
Prop 22 passed so they stay as contractors
I voted for Trump and I thought the same..."dude...just relax for 12 hours...you'll win!" He can't help himself sometimes.
I'm moving to Stuttgart, Germany

Edit.: Guys I just trolled, I already am a citizen of Stuttgart. I just finished university in October and now move back to Benztown.

My condolences to the average American Joe though, maybe it's time to move to a country that values solidarity and has a democracy that lets you at least chose between more than two evils.
I need to play some video games, someone ping me when something happens
I think the deficit talk came in late when the prospects for Donnie were starting to look dicey. With a senate and pres win, they would have the leverage to push a $2T+ bill with concessions from dems. Remember, they were willing to do a big bill but it had to have their conditions and special provisions.
because they literally stopped counting votes. the fuck is this tonight
Market looking relaxed considering. Maybe they just don‚Äôt believe the antics anymore?
God Bless America -> God Save America

I already bought my position but I am looking to buy in the dip
Gold wasnt a hedge during the beginning of March crash from what I remember. It dipped to 1500 with the markets before it spiked over 2k
Because he‚Äôs afraid he‚Äôs going to lose with mail-in ballots, which democrats have used more than republicans. Even as a republican, it‚Äôs pretty fucking sad that he‚Äôs doing this

They said it wasn‚Äôt right
He‚Äôs a bitch ass
Well clearly half of the country doesn't mind too much of this.  So...

So not only could we could get a contested election, even if Biden does win the GOP will likely lead senate and house, which means no stimulus or a tiny one at best. They're not gonna want to make Biden look good. This could get ugly.
this election feels like forever
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwww

Normalized racism and misinformation. He's also made me pay more attention to politics and the fragility of our country. He also really uprooted the ugliness of our country in 4 years, when it would've taken another 20 years to see just how gross we are.
i clicked the daily thread for a second and instantly regretted it

this thread is so much better
Imagine if Obama talked about "stop counting votes"

Fox news would fucking implode
We have that. It‚Äôs the TSLA call retards. Highly trained and potent autists that specialize in losing money
cause there's only 2 directions
Thanks the dems too for suspending counting the last 6% in areas that were statistically for trump. Shit basically assured this would happen. Two stupid situations both working in perfectly harmony
He has to be expecting not to be a clear winner. No other explanation.
TLT bros unite
[deleted]
but gme gonna go up ya?......
TBH, Trump won't go down in the history as an embarrassment for everything he has done. This is a super tight fight
Biden needs 2 of these: mi, wi, ga, nc, pa

I think he picks up one of them for sure, but 2 I'm not so sure. I still see this as a slight Trump advantage, probably 70/30 odds.
[deleted]
The worst outcome one could have imagined!
They were claiming all this at 11 pm too lol
BoTH SiDeS
And in 2016 we said hold my beer

Oh I can read. You're just wrong and it's infuriating.
Dont confuse a bachelors degree with education.
The only good thing about that Trump speech is it means these guys will get up off their asses and start counting the votes before a case can be filed
You haven‚Äôt been paying attention then.
No
AZ and NV fell. SPY $400
Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) have won California vote to keep drivers as contractors
I said odds have been all over the place. Meaning he was a dog, and then up big, and then almost even, and now up bigger again. Just pointing out that the gambling odds may or may not mean shit. Not sure what‚Äôs confusing about that

That works.

Tbf they have both been impeached, neither removed from office
Bad for the markets if they have to recount for days...

Also stalemate congress would be really bad
You're a clown if you think Biden wins pennsylvania and michigan

Yeah I was up 300% ish on my spy puts and VIXY calls. Went down to up about 10% today. Was kicking myself, but also stuck to my plan. Mine all expire end of November and end of December. Good luck to you tho on these. I think we will see some circuit breakers, however I‚Äôve been saying that for 2 weeks.
I'm happy for all you bitch ass bears and all, but how my AMC calls looking?
Only CHADSDAQ was up that much. Dow and SP didn't even reach up 2%. I think the NQ didn't even go red yet.

It‚Äôs literally not.  There‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of mail-in votes to be counted in most of those big states, like Pennsylvania.

I mean. They stopped voting and one of the states reported 100% voted counted at 9 and suddenly had 9% more later. It is shady. (I am a mathematics student) I also did the stats and the three contested core states Biden would been to win 72% of all outstanding votes and the areas are not majority heavily blue areas. It does look sus ngl. Gosh.... I so dearly hope there isn‚Äôt a civil war or more civil conflicts in general. I am so sick of this politicos violence bullshit :/

it's not the speech, it's the riots that are prestaged and planned for 4PM tomorrow across the country.
Been saying election couldn‚Äôt possibly be decided in 1 night for weeks now. There‚Äôs going to be rioting either way who wins. Covid cases are reaching all time highs. Halloween events + protesting = more cases. Trump will contest if loses, libs will protest in masses if he wins. I don‚Äôt see how people were so bullish going into this.
This is the weirdest day. Futures were -1%, then futures were +4% and now looks like they are going red again

It looks like the equivalent of an MMA fight. They‚Äôre talking themselves up like they already one the fight, and sure it‚Äôs just talking shit. I don‚Äôt think anyone is seriously gonna take that as a win. Did u really think it was gonna be trump or Biden just based on the votes? No. Dems are gonna skew, if not dems are gonna riot and call UN. If Biden wins, 2A guys are gonna come out full gear, right is gonna clash and snap at the corruption between when counting was stopped and continued. It‚Äôs the equivalent of a fucking rust server and is toxic as shit on both sides. Give me fucking mr beast for pres
Well it is... that‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt called it yet. Biden has been exceeding Hillary‚Äôs number per county basis.

Free fall and Tech holding on for dear life after last week‚Äôs beatdown. A divided congress and a contested election was the worst scenario for bulls and it is here
Did Trump buy spy puts to hedge his election ?
It wasn‚Äôt a bull fake out or a trap, brave people who weren‚Äôt pussies tried pricing in a decisive win and ended up being wrong

Take ur head out of ur ass
Pretty funny all the pundits said that a Blue Wave would moon the market, a Trump win would moon the market, and the status quo would moon the market.  Only a contested election would cause it to go down
At least tech is still green, hoping these levels hold so I can get in on puts before Trump goes full Trump
yes, some states stopped for tonight and will resume in the morning.
When in doubt, get the hell out
Hey guys I did sell my plug calls today so that was good.

You should bei fine after all. For the future: if you want to stay with IGM you should buy deep ITM calls/put 1-2 month outstanding (5-10 ‚ÑÖ over price). Those have the best risk/reward ratio. Only do calls on down days and puts on up days. ALWAYS (!!!) do the same trade on Demo first and watch the options chart. Buy options once prices in the options chart (!!) are cheep. Thats for example the case in a down Trend after a FAP (fake Asian Pump) in the night at 7:50-8:50 in the morning German time.

Hahahaha its actually so close Trump declared victory and that he'll go to the supreme court to stop "fraud" from happening.

During the civil war, make sure to yell out TSLA 420 yolo if you ever get taken as a POW, that way I'll know not to fire. Promise you'll do the same for me
That‚Äôs all he won, though.
They‚Äôve already switched to talking about deficit spending. I think Rubio is the only one I saw who said he‚Äôd at least support a big bill

If Trump does win it will be curious to see if his big stimulus talks were real or just for votes
269/269 theta wins again tomorrow
That has never even been near the table for Biden. Don't misinform.

It's funny that you think Trump is the fascist while the left continually attacks free speech, both physically and verbally. Antifa are the closest thing we have in this country to a fascist movement, using violence and intimidation to silence people that don't believe what they do.
50/50
Their coverage has been largely neutral I thought. Not acting all snarky about trump for no reason.
It's actually not that close.  2000 was far closer. Florida decided that election by a few hundred votes.   Trump has huge leads in PA, WI, MI that it will be impossible for Biden to make up the ground.  It's ridiculous they can't count all the votes tonight.  There's no statistical way Biden has a ton of votes still in route by mail

thats a recipe for disaster
Trump made a speech declaring victory and telling the Supreme Court to stop counting votes
With Trump bringing the counting of votes into question, I am 100% sure the market is going to dig a hole all the way to China tomorrow.

Yeah, when Trump was saying Biden can't catch up in certain states, just glancing at the numbers, it was clear that wasn't true.
Can't have high COVID numbers if you don't test for COVID. Guess he wants to see how that works with votes.

*IT'S A BOLD STRATEGY COTTON, LETS SEE HOW IT PAYS OUT FOR HIM.*
Not the exact words, sure, but he clearly said the remaining votes are in his favor, essentially declaring his victory.
Cant believe people are STILL defending Trump as if he hasnt been planning this for months now

It was looking like he‚Äôs going to lose PA, GA, and WI with the mail in voting. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs scared and calling it

Thank you, Madame President, for pumping my puts.
ü§Ø
ü•≠ hasn‚Äôt lost the election and he‚Äôs claiming that it‚Äôs been stolen. Calls on chaos
Holy shit, wish i had grabbed a screenshot of CNN. Big bar headline just reads "Trump says he'll go to the Supreme Court; Unclear why." ü§£ü§£ü§£
Of course we would get worst case scenario here...
i think we're watching stimulus hopes die in front of ours right now, /RTY is -3.5%...
Lol how did people actually vote for this fucking loser.

Maybe... Europe will make us green? üòåüò≠
Double limits would be one for the history books
We‚Äôre going down pretty good. Considering how high we were earlier this is a decent bleed
My liver.
Sounds like someone‚Äôs scared to death for tomorrow
The only reason Biden has so many votes is because we are one of the biggest voting nations of all time. If we didn't vote in such large numbers he would have a very tiny small part of the vote. He's honestly lucky I let people even vote for him, he's very unqualified.

Trump supporters literally want to ruin the fucking economy

Look at their demographic - poor ass shitholes.

All the red in FL is literally fucking garbage - can confirm, FL born. Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, AND Miami ALL blue. Where the fuck else you going in FL that isn't some redneck backwoods shit.

Republicans on masks - "My body my choice - don't infringe my freedom!!!!"

Republicans on abortion "Woman could be successful if they just embrace our views"

THIS MAN JUST MADE THE MARKET TURN AND YOU GULLIBLE COCK SUCKERS PROBABLY THINK ITS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME FUCKING GRAND SCHEME TO STEAL THIS ELECTION

When in reality, he is rapidly destroying all credibility this nation has

EVERY NATION NOW HAS PROOF 50% OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS DUMB AS A FUCKING ROCK - Really bullish

holy fuck

KEEP GOING, COUNT EVERYTHING IN AZ!

BUT STOP COUNTING WI MI PA NC & GA !!!!!!
Gotta be
Yes
Bc Trump said he won and that the supreme court should step in to stop counting votes
She‚Äôs crusty dawg, ivanka got some jugs
lol I can see the market selling off a lil bit but I think It'll be alright I can see trump keeping the AF1 jets until Friday. Cant imagine what scheme he's up to.
No worries. Just have the most powerful man in the world lying to his own country. Just a flesh wound
#RIP bulls.. OMG the wake up horror show for those who slept ü§£
How tf has fox not called Georgia yet?
Bigly
I thought I was trippin when I saw the 10yr at -10% wow
i dont think its the supreme court stuff per se, but more of the fact that hes acting scared... market not so confident in him anymore
We were like 3% away from limiting up.
It fucking looks like it
GOD EMPEROR TRUMP ASCENDS!

Poor man. Kanye should‚Äôve said to only count the votes that he‚Äôs in
shit pisses me off
Trump was a bear all along
I wish
Not sure why mango had to go full retard. He was ahead in pennsylvania and michigan. All he had to do was  just to keep his mouth shut and get his win, but no he just couldn't help himself.
Lawyer on MSNBC is saying the SCOTUS could actually halt the vote counting
Puts on bi-den
This is how it worked every election, ever.  From the times they brought ballot results in on horses to today.  You get the votes, you count em
Fuck Donald is a genius he just ignited a fire that will burn all night into tomorrow, single best market manipulator in history
they had technical issues and a pipe burst at one location. the will restart at 8am
Why did the counting stop in Michigan and Wisconsin?
Thats definitely the signal to gtfo if there is one.
The most dangerous speech of my lifetime just happened

nah, im an army vet and ever since that 'losers & suckers' shit he's been losing a ton of support in the military community. also from my experience most military generals and higher ups dont really seem to like him at all
How are markets gonna react to this stuff
when the world is waiting 


they go fucking sleep 

it is just as corrupt as JB
the constitution only says a winner must be picked for the inauguration in January, and nothing about before that. this will drag on longer than the al gore/bush one.
He's not wrong. An incumbent just declared victory without the race being called. This is shit you see in third-world countries.
They are in part 10 of their discussion thread? We might have to give up or title as the most retarded sub on here
There goes the futures....what a bunch of bullshit.

Do you think he planned to say that or did it just happen in the moment? I didn‚Äôt think it was going to go that way

It ain‚Äôt slow. But also ain‚Äôt fast enough for me

If I had to guess, I'd say all of them.

I called this.  Trump declaring too soon and the markets tanking.  Fuckkk
the real question is. Does SPY even give a shit?
Biden will accept defeat so that‚Äôs that. Still a more than good chance he loses this

Trump doesn‚Äôt sound like he will do that in the scenario he loses. This is George W Bush‚Äôs to get on air with former Presidents Carter, Clinton and Obama and to demand Trump to quit the shenanigans
Yeah I‚Äôm buying puts. Trump just set the stage to contest this shit

lol wtf
TRUMP SAID

‚ÄúFutures looking too damn green rn. One of u stooges gimme an idea on something ridiculous I Can say to tank this market. NOW!‚Äù

Lmaoooo
[deleted]
What happened is they suspended vote counting because of the extremely high probability if they continued counting, they would secure DJT his win tonight.

What Trump said WASNT to NOT count the votes, it was simply to ensure MORE votes did not suddenly appear out of the blue, which happens often in shitty countries with election fraud.
‚Äúbig red wave coming‚Äù
for a president that cares about a strong market, he sure knows how to fuck it up

Yeah I'm confused how his fans are for this. 

This freaking country was built on this idea of the peoples vote. Nevermind that it's a bullshit idea with the electoral college but still, voting is the basis of this freaking country.
This is not permanent... they can count later.

And mail in ballots are susceptible to frauds https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/political-insider-explains-voter-fraud-with-mail-in-ballots/

Ballots can be discarded, mailed to dead people, mailed to people who already moved to another location...

Best case scenario is for us to open blooody red then moon mid day off of a trump victory
Yeah because thats just what he tells you. Hoe fucking stupid are you people. They are taking it to court because the court ordered the USPS to conduct a ballot sweep and Dejoy said no and didn't do it. Trump tried to throw the votes away. This is why we are going to court. The guy knows he's losing. Just sat up there and acted like states are done when there is so much counting left to do. I hate this country.

Trusted Mango to tank it , thought it will be series of tweets .. but press conference is much better though
Who says they are legitimate?
Trump is up by 118k with 286k votes remaining. Math
420c 4/20
I dont care who you support this is some banana republic bullshit and if youre to dense to see how dangerous this is i dont know what to tell you. A lot of trumpers talk about protecting their rights but never in history has someone seized power like this and given citizens more rights.

Don‚Äôt be so dramatic. He doesn‚Äôt want to throw out all the votes, just the ones for Biden. Get a grip.
"The president pledged to fight the results of the election at the supreme court.  
  
‚ÄúWe will be going to the US supreme court. We want all voting to stop,‚Äù Trump said."
Definitely did. Pence had to try to clean that up.

Bond market called this hours before the stock market. Those smart fuckers, did it again.
Yea pal. The only problem is it will be done through the court system. You know, the thing that lawfully & peacefully settles disputes? How would you have disputes resolved? Or I guess you think disputes just shouldn't be resolved and the injured party should just pound sand? cause not being able to get your redress against the government would be like.. umm.. literally fascist? or I guess if it's not done the way YOU want then it's not right? cause you should be the dictator..
Yes, and I assure you he did not say ‚Äúwe won‚Äù
I feel like I live in another world after seeing that utterly fascist speech.  60 million people voted for that guy and still call themselves "American".  Unbelievable.  That was Russia a few decades ago.
Hes going to the Supreme Court to stop vote counting

Mango 2020‚Äôed the fuck out of that speech, jaw to the ground
[removed]
Puts on what?
Trump really cucked futures
Fucking NBC cut him off wtf did he say
so why did the votes counting stop?
You r fuk. I shall yolo in your honor, fallen brother.
Last contested election with Gore and Bush, market tanked -8%
Imagine being a bull that went to bed at 10:00 pm thinking your calls were gonna print because ü•≠ won
He said it‚Äôs a fraud. HE SAID THE ELECTION IS A FRAUD. Why doesn‚Äôt this concern you?
It will be the biggest swing since the election 4 years ago

That time it just went in reverse
this will take weeks probably if they go to courts
All you retards. Relax. Trump said he wants to stop counting ballots that are received after election day. That is already their lawsuit in several states.
mango effectively claimed he won even though he admitted some states haven't finished counting
i would like to report someone being douchetastic...
Not at all the point... getting a degree from Texas tech university won‚Äôt do u any good and many of ur average American kids will go to schools like that and those degrees don‚Äôt do anything for u only certain schools have enough power to get u good jobs by graduating from them
I need more covfefe to keep me up cus now im watching futes
Donnie just injected VIX with steroids. Holy fuck. Welp, looks like I was totally wrong about volatility being overpriced. It's just money, right....
trump -300 on my online book
I should go to bed but I can‚Äôt stop watching this circus. We‚Äôre like the washed out drunk who is way past our prime and are now training some poor fuck who still believes in us
For me, it's more like I do mild research, blink, the company does really well, blink, the stock tanks, I panic sell, blink, it goes up, blink, I buy again to ride the wave, blink, it's down again, and I hold until I can break even one day 5 years from now.
65 million people voted for ü•≠. I think people are legit curious about fascism.
Mango has crossed over into full fascist. Attempting to stop the counting of legitimate votes is literally fascism. I'm upset we're even at this point.
Nasdaq +5% to near flat. Small caps approaching limit down.

Guessing you also defended Trump on his injecting bleach joke too lol
This is some Africa/South America shit. Can't believe people go for it
Oof I have UVXY calls and VXX calls. I‚Äôm definitely holding through the week
Lmaoooo bulls were dancing in the streets when futures was up +3.4% during low volume hours. Now they worried.

This is election time futures for ya. NOTHING IS SAFE.
The margins dont matter. They cant count mail in yet
What a mess of a chart. What‚Äôs with all those arbitrary lines that resemble the queues at Wendy‚Äôs?
Prolly a war wound from his early battles with Corn Pop.

Good by futures my old friend. The tendies that never were
'stop counting votes' is the most un-american shit I've ever heard

puts on our country if SCOTUS actually decides to stop counting and throw out votes. literal banana-republic shit
WHY DID I SELL FUCKING SPY PUTS
DONNY DUMP SAVED US LONG LIVE MANGO MAN
2020 gonna 2020,what you gonna do bulls?
Trump's comments scream to me that he knows he's going to lose, so he has to take it to the court
Well this is the most volatile outcome, strap in boys and grab some VXX
Expecting like he said a ‚Äúrush of new ballots that were found at 4am‚Äù. Likely story when over 100 million ballots were mailed in

And that‚Äôs exactly what he said. Can‚Äôt blame him cuz alternatives to leaving include bankruptcy and jail.
bulls in shambles
Don‚Äôt worry QQQ will follow them now that Trump just basically said he‚Äôs gonna contest the election
[deleted]
Just count the votes I like.
I mean it‚Äôs somewhat clear that Biden has a solid path to victory.
It seems like a good chunk of the republican establishment that has now been re-elected is starting to stand up to him
Biden should‚Äôve just gone to a gun range at every sun belt state while wearing a pride flag bandana. He would‚Äôve United the rednecks and the waggots.
Exactly . SMFH
Here we go people
Hoooooooooolllllyyy shiiiiiiiit
who did puts vote for wtf
grats retard ur gonna be rich
United we stand, divided we fall.  1.2% differential...
Tomorrow is boutta be lit. If the SC decides I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if States started peacing out
so let me get this straight, Trump wants to keep counting in Arizona, but doesn't want to count anywhere else...WTF?
MSNBC just acting like the fucking president didn't call the election a fraud and that he was going to get the Supreme Court to stop the votes.

They got that numbers tard talking about fucking Pennsylvania.

THIS AIN'T THE NEWS RIGHT NOW, DO THE SCARY NEWS
Fuck that i dont wanna be president of anywhere let alone the US. Politics is a shit show
Red senate = no sweeping tech breakup
Even Ben Shapiro said what Trump did was irresponsible
Both claiming victory, this is going to get so ugly. Markets aren‚Äôt liking this at all.
Biden spoke before trump, right?
Hunter Biden must feel like shit right now, poor kid screwed over his dad 

he just wanted to smoke some crack and get some free money 

he did nothing wrong

This was the perfect outcome for my UVXY calls right?? cash out EOW or tomorrow?
Didn't he mean to stop collecting new votes...not stop counting the ones already in? That's how I interpreted it. They freaking out too much.
This is what my uvxy calls needed!

Circuit breaker tomorrow!!!!?!
i dont know
Bigly.
He's usually polite to my puts
I mean I have no clue what he's going to do, I don't think he does either. I just said they're literally putting words in his mouth. Call him out on rambling, or calling premature victory, but don't just make bullshit up.
Dow drops 260 points, who cares love you trump

trump said the worst things you could say
Even fox news is disputing donny, wow

But his concern is not baseless.

Mail in ballots are susceptible to fraud and there are frauds

Trump‚Äôs speech just made Gay Bears Rich asf
Lmao trump trying to stop the counting of votes. What a bold guy
I would not put it past him to try again. He could even do a trump trump jr ticket
This is the man the right loves so much, the man who blatantly is circumventing democracy just to retain his position of power. Oh but he's still a patriot though, right? Fucking imbeciles
wait, is trump gonna win?
I was hoping for a sleepy Joe comment.
Wants counting to stop where hes winning, and wants counting to keep going where he thinks he can flip it. This was very expected
no thanks lol. worse than here
Biden supporters how you feeling?
Calls on the people with the guns
So what? You think North Koreans, Chinese, Europeans, Russians, etc... think they all just suck? 

No way. It‚Äôs the same there as it is in the US. People talk trash about other countries, get caught up in the same BS as they do, live essentially the same kinds of lives as they do.

The fortunate ones are those which haven‚Äôt come into contact with society, because they‚Äôve got to keep the real peace. Unfortunately however, all of of our countries being greedy and ran by solely profit (as they all do ofc, it‚Äôs the only way to ‚Äúthrive‚Äù in globalism) will ruin those simplistic lives before they even know it. 

We all suck. I bet you‚Äôre typing off an iPhone that was built by kids. How about the TV you watch that was built off essentially slave labor, or how about the multiple products you probably use every single day, hours, maybe even minutes, we‚Äôre built by Ugyhur slaves?

Open your eyes, friend.
right
they've stopped counting the votes, dummie. KEEP COUNTING THE VOTES!

i know it‚Äôs basically only cali awake right now but can u retards shut up?

70% majority vote is actually disgustingly high you copypaste sheep
^idiot spotted
Trump up 2.5% in GA with 10% remaining to count.  However the remaining votes are all from Atlanta which probably does break for Biden more than 66%.  Biden still favored to win GA about 63% likely.

North Carolina has Trump up about 1% but allows mail in ballots to count if received by Nov. 12th so that one is no where near done.
Damnnnnnn
He needs to pray first before bed time.
I was right
Trump is like a school kid saying ‚Äúmy ball if you don‚Äôt play how I want I‚Äôm going home‚Äù

Anyone watching Trumps speech? This dude is actually fucking retarded lmao claiming we‚Äôre gonna stop counting mail in ballots what the fuck lmao
This is a pivotal moment for our democracy
Nasdaq under 2% now
This might let him dominate the air waves but it won‚Äôt stop the rest of the vote from being counted. 

When it does come down to it, Trump can get fucked and his ass will be hauled out of the office via arrest if it is required should he lose this election

As a society we can‚Äôt afford an election in which the loser doesn‚Äôt accept defeat and neither can our tendies.
If NQ goes red tonight, it might be one of the greatest swings in Futures since March when we went green from a limit down.

So Republifucks out there, how y'all justifying this one? Your retarded leader legit talking about throwing out votes since it could cause an upset. I seriously don't know what's possibly more unpatriotic and unamerican than this.

He's running in 2024 too. He said yesterday he'll do so well they'll want him to run again. By then he'll have appointed the entire SCOTUS. All he has to do is run, then when they deny him, sue and the Supreme Court says he can run for a third term then he can. That's how it works, RIGHT?! SCOTUS will just say term limit infringes on his god given right to run for office in this democrazy?! Hey, they do it on voting rights, race, sex, and marriage. Why you discriminate against Orange people??
*haha jk*

There it is, the president wants to stop counting votes because he's ahead. The most un-American shit I've ever heard of.
Yeap, he really did it.

On a somewhat related note, technical analysts that claim we're going to see a market crash even greater than what we saw in March because we're forming a megaphone pattern, annoy me to no end.
Oh my god hahahaha VIX is about to moon
He‚Äôs putting on a brave face but they know they have to have a near perfect sweep to pull it out

Wtf!
I‚Äôm at the gym I missed it what did mango say
Fascism
How did you win the election when the election isn‚Äôt even over yet and your not even leading...
basically, worst case scenario happening now, fuck you 2020
I know that he‚Äôs been telegraphing this strategy of coming out and claiming victory regardless for weeks now (as he‚Äôs rightfully not excited by his general prospects with mail-in votes), but it‚Äôs still kind of surreal to see it.

It‚Äôs sad that we‚Äôre going to get not just weeks of battles over vote legitimacy, but a rockier few years in which the other side feels like the other side cheated (regardless of how it lands). Democracy needs faith in it to work well, and this is a bearish day for it. 

In the words of Mango: Sad!

Hearing from multiple sources at M&A bulge brackets and regional boutiques that they have never been this busy. This seems to be the case globally (US, Europe and Asia). Bankers are working on multiple deals and the calendar going into Christmas is super-busy. **The overall theme of deal rationals seem to be "optimism" about the future on all angles - the overall economy, individual idiosyncratic company strength and funding climate.**

Yes, banker are always "busy" but this is for real. Hard to see how any political grid-lock in the US would change this.

**There will be merger-mania over the next few months.** Can the chart match 2019 (and even 2015) levels?

I think Mango Man is speaking softly cos Barron is sleeping in the next room. I remember last election the poor kid couldn't stay awake when Papa Trump was making his victory speech
SUPREME COURT SHIT
Some states allow mailin ballots to be counted as soon as they arrive, some states won't allow them to be opened until 7am on 11/3.  So with a shit ton of mail in ballots coming in, they started opening envelopes up this AM and will be opening them for days and days.

Note that these states tried to ask for emergency authorization to start working on them early and got sued by republicans to stop.

!!!!!!!!!!!HE ACTUALLY SAID IT. HE ACTUALLY SAID IT!!!!!!!

Ur mad

‚ÄúThis is a fraud on the American public‚Äù

‚ÄúFrankly we did win this election‚Äù

Oh boy
oh shit
Please keep talking üçäman
Lmaooooooo!!!
And.... there go futures
He‚Äôs calling it a fraud lmfao so umm, markets didn‚Äôt you said you don‚Äôt like uncertainty?
There it is
HE SAID IT
I didn‚Äôt realize there were people more retarded than us. But here we are. Listening to Donnie talking about how he‚Äôs won states that haven‚Äôt counted major counties and people eating it up.
One thing he confirmed for me, celebrate all your victories man...
Lmao vix up futures down. Emperor mango forever
watching futures candles and this speech at the same time is big luls
God I can't wait for this election to be over with. Either way it goes, I just want people to shut the fuck up already
oh no
Here we gooo
Dump it
This is a VIX pump conference LOL
AYO HOMIE THATS NOT IN THE SCRIPT
I'm lost, is this election misinformation class from our prez?
Hate BJs are the best BJs!
OMG HE CALLED JLIT
Frankly we did win this election.

Vix immediately spiked up.
oh yeahhhh donald dump is out today
NBC fact checking Donny in the middle of his talk, LOL, perfect.
VIX mooning as soon as he said he won
Trump claimed victory
HE CALLED IT
No shit but hopefully u can tell when he is looking at it
jesus fuck puts on this country
if he's retired, then he likely doesn't give a shit about the EPA anymore. he's looking out for his own pocket. also, your retired asian immigrant father with a PhD is probably a casual racist
Another COVID party
If this is true, how did you recover from this? I‚Äôm pretty far down in the hole and ready to call it quits as well. How do you learn to not be so retarded?
This is like the one single Trump presser with some factual stats being thrown out lol
[deleted]
Source?
NBC cutting him off LOL holy fuck
[deleted]
He is tired
Ohh shit
There it is
Dipshit trump voter LOL
Is Trump making a last ditch effort to pump? God bless this man. Hes at autistics level that this sub will never reach.
Futures mad. Donny said he won
"THIS IS A FRAUD" - Trump
Futures red now üëÄ
how come i‚Äôm sitting here unemployed while the person running sound for the  gd president doesn‚Äôt even know how to ring out a mic?
Sounds like he thinks he‚Äôs gonna lose
Regeneron
Get to the point
There it is
imagine flexing a state that's been voting red since 1970 like its some fucking accomplishment
Mango needs to go to bed
the thing that lost this for Biden was the fact that his bald spot looks like he got bucked off of a motorcycle on to the back of his head
Underwhelming
[deleted]
here we go, calling it a fraud and futures shit the bed
lmao NBC calling him out on his lies mid speech
I was promised riots
Bruhhhh
He just called the election a fraud
Have a friend who said Biden doesn't have a chance and I'm like he could lose but the gap won't be this big. A lot of these numbers are deceptive.
Pre-election polling companies need to come up with new polling strategies cuz this ain't it...
[deleted]
Yeah so the real trade off is free education to stay unemployed or go abroad :p
[deleted]
kinda
Smooth transition of power obviously not on his radar
It's kinda what he does
Have you guys noticed that everytime trump dances he busts out moves that make him look like he‚Äôs jerking off casper
Ehh yeah I'm sleep, sorry but usage among young people is down massively something like 50%+ since legalization homie
[deleted]
Shit show!!!
If Biden is looking good I think so
He was upset when he won last time... Why wouldn't he be upset?
sounds like this is gonna be a mail-in ballot challenge ?
He started strong, but he's drifting now
[deleted]
Late night. He was planning twitter rage and forced to speak. Already did his coke
Lol nbc cutting trump off for lying...
This.. all the other votes that come in are going to be ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù
because they only polled democrats like in 2016?
Mango pump
Her MMA name would be Tiffany ‚ÄúThe Trainwreckkkkkkk‚Äù Trump
Catch me outside how bout dat
This speech will be legendary, win or lose.
Yes. I think 3 recreational, 2 medical?
I need whatever drugs Trump is on to be so lucid so late at night for someone that just had covid a few weeks ago and has been traveling non-stop for weeks.
Trump just called Trump in GA, NC, PA, MI and WI

Looks like Trump wins, according to Trump
Thanks to ‚Äúdata analytics?‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt even mean anything you shithead.
Omg why he talks so much üò© just say we look like we‚Äôre winning, smile and leave.
  
Ffs I have no puts, stop talking
This guy talks like my stoner buddy
I can't tell if I'm high or he is
They said ‚Äúoooooo‚Äù
And also bunch of shy trumpers, and also polls are trash
/r/Conspiracy
Nah, said it elsewhere. But he wants to claim victory here (and he even emphasized the margin to highlight ‚ÄúHOW COULD WE LOSE!?‚Äù) so if he ends up losing over night/next couple days, he‚Äôll call bs on the mail in votes
Oh shit here we go boys
How do I get this tan
This speech is a bit painful to watch so Imma sleep and hope he‚Äôs right by morning
Lot of coping in here
Wow ü•≠ got that creepy "she gave consent" voice
4:1...exciting!
[deleted]
yea pretty fun
‚ÄúAnyways, who wants to see Lil Limp again tonight?‚Äù - Trump
TRUMP FLEXING TEXAS AND GEORGIA (WHICH HE HASNT EVEN WON) LMFAOOOOOO
Looks like tonight it's Donald DUMP!!!!!!!!
At least 2 million.
I figured even if he got elected, market would pump, but he can't even do that right.
4 more years and a republican majority senate. Stonks go up
Lol look out guys he is up 13 votes in PA üòÇ
Wasn‚Äôt it -365 at one point?
It‚Äôs amazing his ego doesn‚Äôt need the popular vote.  Must be hard for him not to spin that.
Got calls on Friday, gadoosh, said market was pricing in a change in presidency, dish, now I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs how I think it‚Äôll go Ba BOOSH
winning texas is like winning  cali for the dems, like no shit
Literally not possible anymore
Lol
A lot of hate for the mango from the pajama traders tonight!
Not anymorw
Why does it sound like he‚Äôs making excuses?
Small Cap -2% and NASDAQ +2% ..

Never seen this before
Top guy
Ohh yea
The difference is that they are not law abiding citizens and the martial guard would be called in just due to the sheer amount of law enforcement needed in order to contain that many criminals.

Got any better ideas than serving the laws put in place and agreed upon by nearly everyone such as not performing arson, looting, or killing?
Is calls on an inverse ETf still a put?
It's not
Any think Trump sounds different? Speaking in a soft tone, almost like hes trembling inside
Russell 2000 -2%, Nasdaq 100 +2%. S&P flat.

This is theta gang‚Äôs wet dream
fucking solar is gonna die regardless tmr
This shit is making my head hurt
Trump knows man.

He's been all over that snack
apparently we live in the stone age and someone over there is counting votes manually
Hey trumpers, he is lying and exaggerating

is that what you do when you're in the clear?
MMEDF üöÄ
That the only stimmy he gave us
Yes you‚Äôll be up 2 whole percent probably.
You really think trump voters are willing to admit that to pollsters?
[deleted]
Low energy states
Yeah fuck me
Just wave the white flag already
That‚Äôs a fact he loves this shit
Always WSB and race wars, what gives?
Idk why people say trump is mad. He‚Äôs just speaking in the same way as before, calm and collected.

Btw did he insult people who voted for Biden? No. Then look at Biden and Hillary...
He has a teleprompter stupid
Is Adderall grandpa claiming he's won Michigan already?
Never listen to the polls. He still could but it's gonna be tight.
he's on drugs...but so is sleepy j. they're both old men for christ sake
Counting your eggs before they hatch is the most WSB thing
I cannot wait to see r/agedlikemilk later this week.
This is way closer than I imagined honestly
A narcissist to the very end
This is gonna be ugly
Yes lol and most of it is super blue areas.
Makes sense
He pauses at weird times like Christopher Walken lol
269:269 contested incoming? is it possible?
They happen to like...

#####.... your president
this whole speech is a bad idea but I got puts so keep going
[deleted]
Trump don't feel stress. He's enjoying it. He's young and in peak health.
What did he say?
Ight imma get started on the curb your enthusiasm winning georgia meme
Man women camera tv ...
Except he‚Äôs not about to win either of those.

Do people just look at the current percent and think that‚Äôs all there is to it?
Lol Trump doesn‚Äôt know what non uniform distribution is
Such a pansy üòÇ
Actually though?
We don‚Äôt need them all. Yeah you do
Calls


On VXX üòé
Once your pp don‚Äôt work no more gaining power is the only way to feel
trump isnt claiming anything shaddap

this shit is boring

nothings gona happen for days

fuck everyone
It's ironic because of how pissed he was at AZ
Trump trying to steal PA and GA, literally. Time to board up the windows folks.
, aristocracy and monarchy for the win. Turns out they had it right all along..
Donnie went out doing what he loved... tanking the market like a mofo
haha this dude
Can already see curb your enthusiasm music compilations coming out if he loses
Are you surprised?
Plnhf
Doesn't Pennsylvania have like 3 million more votes to count?
Forget DJT, but do none of you care about having another 4 years of enduring his Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumbass? Them two are just so damn annoying.
I agree
Probably b/c of mail in.
[deleted]
Clown show.
You want donalds sloppy seconds?
Think about who makes the polls and who they poll. It‚Äôs not like they go to 50% dems and 50% Republicans
Bruh don't hold too long. Pretty sure etfs are bad long term
The strategy in faking Georgia early is so that when it proves wrong they can start a race war there
They also predicted Hillary‚Äôs ‚Äúlandslide.‚Äù
He shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned Texas lmao it‚Äôs embarrassing how close it was for a deep red state
whats taking the other states so long? are they sleeping?
‚ÄúWinning Pennsylvania‚Äù except nothing worth a damn has been counted. My god people are fucking more autistic than us
So does the election thread have "moves for tomorrow" and this is the election thread? 

Inverse wsb, reddit switcheroo rigamerole n such
[removed]
The fucking zealots in that room...
Imagine thinking "winning Texas" is an accomplishment ü§° No fucking shit, that state's been voting red since 1970
Ambien is kicking in
Isn‚Äôt it past his bedtime?
Is he whispering? Mysterious Mango Man
Nice try, CNN
Ok üòÇ
MAGA COUNTRY ! !!  üòÇ
No calling Georgia too soon is literally his play. So when the mail in votes and all the votes from Atlanta area come in, he will say ‚ÄúSee, i told you they were stealing election!‚Äù and his base will eat that shit up
STONKSS!
scientifically peaked to ripen right on election day. he's on the juice.
Like the last election, Trump won where it mattered the most thanks to data analytics.
lmao trump just lying  straight up but all you cult worshippers are eating this up so nicely
A new one recently opened near me. I've never seen new a Wendy's open in my life. Buy calls.
I think Trump wins but I really really really really hope he's making his own Dewey defeats Truman with this statement
Somebody tell me if my weed stocks are printing tomorrow. Legalized in 5 new states
Correct, Biden needs any 2 of the remaining states.  They all have a lot of urban and mail-in ballots left to count.  The polls would need to have been WAY off for Trump to take them all.  Like 3x more off than 2016.  

Many of them also count ballots received in the mail for up to 3-10 days after the election, and mail-in has been heavily weighted toward Biden.
His face is looking especially poop colored tonight
Big brain bear
Low energy Mango tonight.

I don‚Äôt know how much Trump can afford to escalate things tbh, republicans want the senate more than they want him
he‚Äôs about to call it
his voice is so soft and creepy
Unbelievable, tremendous.
Georgia comment is gonna bite him in the ass
Oh shit he called Georgia as a win when it definitely isn‚Äôt
Atlanta will be key. He definitely could still lose
just realized ur greeküòÅ
Guess we can chalk this presser up to worthless
You can‚Äôt just call states for yourself lol
Dump it
Trump is RAGING
Bo Jackson in trumpmo bowl
Power
hope y'all bought puts
Wishful thinking
Tonight
how the hell is the race so closed?

a lot of pollsters called it a landslide win for Biden, what happened to that?
i think calling a state, before u win it, is a dangerous mistake lol
He‚Äôs setting the stage to call for a revolt when he inevitably loses the states he thinks he‚Äôs ‚Äúwinning‚Äù right now.
[deleted]
Donald Trump: Fuck Arizona
Markets literally flubber right now
Dude just calling shit for himself now

hes so mad ahahahahaha
oh shit he's calling georgia when its still not clinched.
He contradicted himself
Idk man he's relatively coherent right now. It's weird
The Zuckerbergs and Gates' of the world drop out of Harvard because it's too easy. Typically, people drop out or don't go to college because it's too hard. Sure, you can become a millionaire by owning 7 gas stations, but like any investment, it can all go to shit, leaving you ass out with no skills and no money
I love you
Uber. I use lyft personally but Uber is more varied right now with Eats
That‚Äôs going to age real bad
SPY fallen flat, VIX creeping, DOW in the gutter, and Tech just vibing
Holy shit üëÄ he‚Äôs going to claim victory. Calls on riots
Oh god that Georgia comment may go into some aged like milk vids
When will Dems learn
Is it me or does he look more Orange?
Why do these old fucks still want to work honestly. Just retire and enjoy your boomer life instead of applying for the most stressful job in the world
RIP Ant IPO 2020-2020

Yes trump. Make my uvxy calls print
Lmao donnie acting like winning red states is a surprise.

If we were any other first world country, the vote would be counted already.
Why did he call GA and AZ
Ivanka a whole fucking snack ü•µ
GOP filed lawsuits preventing it from being allowed
I‚Äôm wondering the same thing ü§î
Lol what same. I swear it said pre-election
Lmao mango actually bragging about winning texas and florida. And y'all make fun of biden. This dude's dick is fucking microscopic.
Jesus, he could easily lose GA still
Yeah he just boasted about a republican winning Texas lmao
LMAO HE JUST SAID HE WON GEORGIA WITH 10% TO GO WITH IT MOSTLY BEING BLUE COUNTIES LEFT AND ATLANTA SHUT DOWN TILL 8 AM
It is free. Also free books also free food and dorm if you poor (depending on availability)

This is all fun and everything and I do enjoy my ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù here in America... but when you hear the ‚Äúissues‚Äù most voters say they are concerned about, you realize that democracy was a fucking mistake and that most people are actually brain dead NPC level retards. 

It is an absolute miracle that government functions at all. If the rich people actually let the important shit get decided on by the people without their expensive propaganda and lobbying, we would be so fucked
Thought my BABA will tank if Trump gets reelected.

Imagine thinking Trump was gonna say GG and go about his life.
Puts on disenfranchising... whatever the fuck that means
Wow strong addies tonight. He was able to pronounce "disenfranchised"

With as slow as the USPS has been, it's hard to say how big of a tsunami of mailin ballots will arrive tomorrow AM, Thursday AM, Friday AM.. there are at least hundreds of thousands of ballots still in flight.

So I'm thinking my UVXY calls are going to print.
Yea you should write gay novels
Biden has AZ
Calls on drugs
Classic mango. One last dump
In five years he‚Äôs going to be walking out of the sea and attacking Tokyo
[deleted]
here it comes
Biden gets AZ for sure
Today I saw that chick in black yoga shorts that are shorter than a panty.
You hear that democrats. You‚Äôre a sad group of people according to ü•≠.
If AZ flips, Nevada lands, and Pennsylvania pull through and or if the senate flips, but prob will not then yes.
You figured it out.. well.. it's really not that bad. Just cause the city is 60/40 for Democrat doesn't mean it's not still 40% Republican. It's not like it an alien world here.
If you look at an election map by population that doesn‚Äôt have empty land filled in red or blue it‚Äôs even more telling
it wont matter who wins, at the end of the day as a WSB autist  i will still find a way to lose money this week

No worries. We're all learning, brother. Have a reasonable understanding of the greeks, have appropriate risk size, don't overpay (either sell options or don't buy when IV is high), and practice is all. I have a lot of theoretical knowledge, but I cannot say that gives me a discernable edge. You get way more edge from having a plan, managing trades through various scenarios, and controlling emotions.

That contract has an approximately equal vega and delta. I was expecting a price run to the Ryzen reveal date (option benefitting from delta). Now, this sub absolutely loves AMD (and for good reason) and starts posting about it nonstop around key events. This causes lots of retail stock and option buying and IV rises everywhere on the option chain where there is a lot of volume. This is key because IV rising (option benefitting from vega) would give me profit even if AMD stock price went down somewhat.

The contract is so far out, I consider theta 0. I just have to have some reasonable sense of where IV/option demand and price might go. Historical IV trends and experience helps here.

Btw, the contract is so far OTM that if there is massive IV drop AND price drop, which is uncommon but can happen, losses are magnified. This is a real risk and can happen after IV and price run up very high together (See AAPL after running to 140 with simultaneous insane IV expansion).
So the election is basically just rural versus urban votes? It seems anywhere near civilization is Democrat and anything near a swamp is republican.

If trump wins now, he loses the popular vote again
Some of the states already said it could take until Friday
they can't find a vein on trump since he has abused those meds too much, going to take a while longer

If Trump wins, I‚Äôm going all long. He‚Äôll pass a big stimulus by EOM that evades eviction/MBS default risk, the one systematic risk in the financial system that even scares JPOW because his printer is powerless against it. 

After that, there is little risk to markets and stocks will rip to new ATHs. The bubble will get even bigger, maybe even becoming the biggest bubble of all time.

Umm, i might be retarded but that just sounds like doubling down
States set it up differently and this year is drastically different so the states that don‚Äôt typically get mass early votes are ill equipped to count them.
does it on purpose to build audience
other states legalizing weed is good for weed stocks regardless of outcome, yes?
If this was in a country with an actual competent government they‚Äôd be staying up overnight or have people in an overnight shift to count.
vega tells you how much the value of your contract will change given a change in IV. If IV is 40% and vega is 0.20 on a $2.00 contract, then a drop in IV to 35% will result in a 5 x .20 = $1 reduction in the contract value

So your contract that was worth $2.00 before IV crush will be worth $1.00 after, neglecting theta and assuming the underlying price doesn't change. I'm guessing the crush won't be as bad since the election will probably be contested for a while
F for the economic recovery. No way R senate works with Biden to pass any stimulus. Surprised futures aren‚Äôt nose diving.

**How the fuck has Mango not spoken yet**
I hope so. That would be great television.
mail in takes time thats why

This is literally the least favourable option of all of the results for financial markets, and it's not being reflected.

That is: Disputed result with Biden leading and probably squeaking in, and a republican senate

So show me the 10% down.

all i know for sure is atlanta is taking a break till 8 am for mail in, i don‚Äôt know the order for mail in and in person for which comes first and which last, it appears michigan is doing in person first and last, Wayne county and Macomb seem to be slow asf per usual
You‚Äôre a child
How many more states have legalized weed now? Y‚Äôall told me 4 years ago that Mango was gonna do it...

So if Trump loses does he run in 2024?

People like you are destroying America.
bro did u just wake up? biden practically lost already lmao stop watching tv jesus retard
Nope. Still just waiting on his slow ass.
This one honestly is way closer than that one
It‚Äôs already 2am EST. It is not Election Day anymore but the second day of election week
PA has 1.83 million mail in ballots that haven‚Äôt been counted.
hedged my QQQ calls with IWM puts fuck guess i did it right
Some governor on CNBC thought they'd get 900k votes for Biden from absentee or mail votes
Who the fuck is trading futures options?
Who dat black dude with the cornrows at the Trump HQ? Dat Kanye?
R Kelly lookin dude in the hoodie
Yeah, he probably won, but lol at ‚Äúgiving him a chance.‚Äù He was already given one for 4 years and he managed to fail every expectation. I used to think that he was just a conman playing to the lowest common denominator. It turned out that he‚Äôs just a retard who‚Äôs incompetent at everything besides shitposting on Twitter.
and Iceland
Ill take it?
Today's an expensive day to do cfds man. 50 points of margin aren't even worth shit in this volatility
Futures pumping a fuckton was also known?
Call baby always Calls.
Fuck Pennsylvania those lazy cheap ass fucks wake the fuck up and count your fucking votes like the taxpayers pay you fucking to do this just once in 4 years holy shit how can you be so incompetent fucking the whole world is watching and the best you fucking do is bring this DMV level slow shit to the party like fucking backwards ass America I'm going to invest in China and fuck you.

My turn. Reply to me and I‚Äôll update you cause this gets swamped in posts
Wow, thanks for sharing. Glad to hear you're finding your own way. I think we all fall into that trap of following where our parents lead so don't be too hard on yourself. Trump is a polarizing figure and either had a lot of people fooled, or was exactly what some wanted.
331p checking in. Bought for exactly that reason.
God damn if Biden wins it's gonna be blue house red senate red SC blue president. Literally nothing is going to get accomplished
PA went home. Others are working through the night i believe? i‚Äôm not sure about michigan
If you‚Äôve watched any news except fix for the last week they have been saying exactly this would happen

Even CNBC

He‚Äôs not even a socialist.
Mango about to speak, futures about to tank. Hard.
FOX does too, just from different topics. One about race and the other about immigrants.
Lindsey Graham.  Oh....
because he thinks he will lose when the mail in votes are all counted
Mango passes out during his speech üòÇ
Everyone's stop counting, process restarting at 10am. See you in the morning folks, please bless my VXX calls.
investing news article algos are probably so confused the way futes are acting.
Don‚Äôt worry bears, Trump will surely deliver our holy crash with whatever vaguely dogwhistling accusations of fraud/cheating/stealing he‚Äôs about to unload :)
How long does it take to count 300k votes in Georgia fuck. What do taxes to towards?

PA waiting for mail in ballots results.. it won‚Äôt be nearly that close when it‚Äôs over

Woo I‚Äôll be so proud
No, you can‚Äôt.
There's no way there's a winner declared tonight anyway. I'm just watching my futures positions.
You made a lot of assumptions and then built more assumptions on top.  PA not a given.

What's happening
I didn‚Äôt say he needs both I just said it was shocking but regardless Georgia OR PA alone doesn‚Äôt do it. He needs 2 of the main 5 left up for grabs.

imagine thinking we didn‚Äôt have the ability to do so lmao jesus
There is zero chance of a resolution by market open.  A lot of states have stopped counting and won't resume until 9am EST.

Many states that Trump is leading by a small margin allow mail in ballots to count if received by 11/6 or even 11/12, or at least postmarked by today.  May not get a result for another week or two.  Then may get a bunch of legal challenges.  All that uncertainty is going to be bouncy.
you guys know the saying, VIX UP DICKS UP
It would make things very interesting

SPY better open up flat or red, dammit!
realistically those ballots will skew to older people, and toward Trump enough that they will probably be split evenly. I wouldn't expect much of a change in results. Trump won elderly voters easily in Florida.

I'm sure those mail in ballots are just scanned into a machine reader. It won't take that long.
They should've given people a better choice than Biden.
I heard he is extremely handsome
Literally nothing worth a damn has been decided lol.
This is a bad take, but give him a chance?  He's had one?

For those wondering which ticket will make the market moon, it's actually quite simple: The Democrats want to make us as much like Europe as possible.  Trump wants to make us as little like Europe as possible.

Especially can‚Äôt leave out the South American countries being controlled by dictators or farming related gangs.

I agree with you for most part since apart from about 15-20 universities all colleges give a similar education.

Results haven‚Äôt budged in like an hour.  I think they‚Äôve stopped counting
alot of votes still havent been counted in those counties and including other GA cities like augusta. i think if he keeps thoe ratios he can squeeze it out.
Given how much big tech was in cahoots to get Biden elected, I have to think Trump winning is going to be bad for lot of them. He's going to go after them
Sleep? Gay

#TRUMP WINS
Should have been Amash or Perot.
So do Alaska and Hawaii matter?  5 points combined.
Trumps at 213 electoral votes with the following states likely voting for him: 
1. NC (94% reporting) = 15 electoral votes 
2. PA (64% reporting with trump at 56.7% total votes) = 20 electoral votes 
3. MI (65% reporting with trunk at 53.7% total votes) = 16 electoral votes 

That puts him at 264 electoral votes with just those three states currently favoring him. 

So he only would need 6 votes to win. 

Currently he‚Äôs set to win in addition to the other three: 
1. WI (84% reporting) - 10 electoral votes
2. GA (93% reporting) - 16 electoral votes 

So that leaves 26 votes that aren‚Äôt even needed for Trump to win. Or, if one of the other states flops and goes dem, he will still win, because...

Biden is currently at 224 electoral votes with the following likely states to vote for him:
1. Nevada (6 electoral) 
2. Arizona (11 electoral)
3. Maine (4 electoral votes) 

That leaves Biden with 21 votes where things currently stand. So if he wins only those states, he would have 245 electoral votes and be short of 25 votes to win. 

Conclusion: if none of the three states initially listed change to dem, it‚Äôs trumps ball.
He knows about northern VA
He only needs 2 of the first 3 you listed.

That leaves Biden with 21 votes where things currently stand. So if he wins only those states, he would have 245 electoral votes and be short of 25 votes to win. 

Conclusion: if none of the three states initially listed change to dem, it‚Äôs trumps ball.
He doesn't need Penn if he gets the others.

Trump getting a fresh shot of regeneron as we wait
It really looked like Sleepy was gonna lose there for a bit, but all these mail-ins sitting uncounted in heavy blue counties gonna save his ass. Couple that with red about to keep the senate and mango contesting the results, we may just have a gay bear wet dream.
holy shit thank you guys for actually like commenting and disagreeing with this cuz my friends are making this prediction and it‚Äôs really pissing me off. keep it comin !!

That's crazy. Y'all actually voted for Trump again...
Trump speaking in 5 minutes.  Calls on how many times he says ‚Äústeal‚Äù.
CNN did?
Biden taking NC or GA, Trump ain‚Äôt winning
This has been analyzed many times and I still have no idea how people don't actually look at culture and the facts behind there success (it's been pointed out many times).

If you've been to Japan, you'd know the country is known for its cleanliness and they strongly respect social distancing and mask wearing. There was no need to lockdown over there if you have both of those under control (along with secure borders).
Are you still holding?
Those are rookie numbers

hmm, if the mail in ballots really work, then biden needs WIsconsin, Penn, and Michigan too, granted he gets Nevada and Arizona to win. He only has 1 win condition!

Fuk - he's really going to do it - prematurely declaring himself the winner.

Source? The votes left are mail ins and from counties favoring Biden ?
He isn't behind?
This is why Trump campaign was upset at Arizona being called so early.
 I can‚Äôt believe ü•≠ is winning
Too many people watch fox on here. This is very close! If trump wins GA (which is looking very close and arguably in Biden‚Äôs favor) then it would most likely come to who wins 2 out of 3 of  PA, MI, and WI. All three of which count early voting and inner city voting last.

Great, so 4 years of red...
As one does.
Neither was Cruz
Remember when Ohio was +10 Biden with almost 60% reporting and then Trump crushed the last 40%?

That's because Ohio counted the mail in votes first.

Penn/MI are the opposite.  They counted the in person votes first.
He thinks NC is VA because in America we don't learn shit about our country.
With Georgia, Biden can win before PA is even called. Just need AZ and NV to clinch, then pick off one of Wisc or Mich

It SUCKS!!!
Need mango to say some shit to make VIX great again.. again
Fuck i think i gotta stay up to watch GA race and maybe some late night drops in MI,WI and PA
They were going to riot no matter who won.
I was kind of shitposting, but to give you a legit answer: those figures of how much is remaining is based on estimates too (some break them down by size of county and others by how much they anticipated) and so the actual remaining is weird. Second, many still haven‚Äôt received all the ballots‚Äî as in they were mailed but still crawling their way over. Third, mail-in voting is pretty consistently Biden-favoring and so this is why Trump is already playing the fraudulent election card and ready to fight mail-in ballots specifically
He hasn‚Äôt even talk yet!
[deleted]
no, it's reversing because there's no clear winner and risk of contested election
Definitely not the case. Realisticly IF trump wins GA which is looking very close, then it‚Äôs whoever wins 2 out of 3 in MI, WI, and PA.

Basically all of remaining votes are in Fulton county which is heavily Blue.  Will be close.

Not true at all. If AZ holds for Biden he doesn‚Äôt need PA - Just WI & MI.

If it comes down to PA, it is going to be a mess....
What's that mean
A.) He closed it late ---much after other European counterparts already did it and secondly, this is especially true for NY, contact tracing illustrated most cases actually came from Europe, not China.

&#x200B;

B.) He should have shut down the country much earlier and actually issued the importance of social distancing and masks. He undermined the importance of both of those keys things many times and undermined the virus itself, calling it less significant than the flu or telling the public that it would end prematurely.

&#x200B;

C.) How did every country (adjusting for population size) do much better than us? Even India, with their shitty sanitation and ridiculous population density did much better than the US. Clearly, there was a failure on a federal level.

I'd agree with the states being the issue if there was only specific ones having issues but that's not the case, we've had absurd levels throughout the whole nation.

Lol. Honestly I‚Äôm only 20 and I was heavily influenced by my parents into believing he was right. He actually cared, blah blah blah. Around 2 years into his term I started to feel differently and realize that he‚Äôs a pos after my family took me to a rally of his. I just felt so out of place. I don‚Äôt like Joe Biden either but I‚Äôd rather have him over Trump. I would love a libertarian president but it‚Äôs just not realistic when the country is as polarized as it currently is. Also most Trump supporters I know(my parents and some old friends) are actually racist and it‚Äôs bothered me forever but enough is enough. Called them out on their bs and decided I‚Äôll never vote Trump, especially not for my first vote ever. And yes, my parents would laugh at his tweets like it‚Äôs a fucking comedy show. I thought they were funny too until I realized the horrible reality. I‚Äôve grown a lot as a person in the years since he got elected and I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm not on his level of thinking.

Also puts on my life when the election is the most exciting thing in it this week
If he at least put competent people in important spot and played golf all day it would be okay. But he give every position to his buddies and children or leave them empty. Like I guess W Bush was a dummy as well, but at least he had a competent organization. (Competent at fucking your poors and brown peoples all around the world but still they knew what they were doing)
Reportedly upwards of 2 million votes left. Most of which are early voting in dem areas.

PA will be super super close at the end imo. Biden supposedly has a 4:1 or more "estimated" advantage on the remaining votes. But Biden doesn't actually need it if he can win Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan (or if he pulls a miracle in Georgia).

A big reason why it's been going up is because it went down a lot last week. Although the volatility is due to the election, the price levels it's reacting at seems to be normal.
How many more votes left to count ?
then wtf do people go and pay 50+k?! its a piece of fuckin paper, nobody cares where that paper was printed
Pretty standard to just blame the poles.  We always did it growing up in rural pa.   Part of brexit.  Remember Germany....  really doesn't need to be a reason.
I mean don't get me wrong, it's not 100%. If it were, they'd call it. But the math makes it seem like Biden is almost a shoe-in.

If the odds are good, I would.
Could easily see Trump raging about GA right now because that would invalidate any type of mail-in ballot shit talking he was going to do at his speech.

We let people who have no idea about politics vote. We needed to fix the education system a while back. 

This statement was both bold and brave. Yes
Keep in mind in Michigan in 2016 they threw out like 200k ballots from Wayne County, where 87% (I'm trying to remember these numbers off the top of my head but it was significant) voted blue.  Trump won the state by a few thousand.

This shit happens.
Not just saying this but I don‚Äôt remember anyone saying Trump would have a landslide W. Polls have predicted a Biden W for a long time now and the consensus has been that Trump won‚Äôt get the popular vote either way, but might get just enough electoral votes.

Kind of like bears v bulls on here...
This.
Well shit on my face and slap my tits 


this is close as hell
Yeah, there will be more uncounted blue votes in the cities, meaning Biden can catch up.
Fuck I hope not
Because Biden doesn't have enough states he can realistically win to put him over 270. Remaining states he wins is ~30 votes.

He needs to win PA to win....
It's pretty likely if you just do a breakdown of remaining counties votes and the Biden / Trump splits in those counties.
U probably right. Thanks bro

Have your even met a Trump guy? The pack micros but pretend they dragging on the floor
[deleted]
That‚Äôs honestly not too out of the question, rural Red counties pretty much fully counted, urban areas still relatively under reporting with <2% gap to fill
Haha fucken pansies üòÇ
i assure you that the split isn't based on political lines
Just another reason to challenge that shit in the courts. 

Shits fucked
The CIA wouldn't let one party win pres and both chambers with a 6-3 SCOTUS. Biden presidency confirmed
should i bet this??
6am is tuff
We can sell options during future time?

wasnt trump going to give a speech? I think he got sedated before he said more dumb shit
Shit I had some good times there.
Can you imagine the meltdowns on this site if mango wins again? /r/politics might not be able to survive this time.
64% chance Biden wins GA based on remaining uncounted votes is what they meant.
Twitter blocked ü•≠tweet,, PUTS ON TWITTER
Yes
You could sell options after hours?
Nah dawg,

&#x200B;

It Biden time!
Unironically a better system than what we have now
His statement's still compatible with that, just saying he needs to filter through all the morons and get the smart degree holders.
Yea if they opened the options markets then I actually would have locked in my gains, which would be quite unusual for me.
If you look at the 15, this is a rather orderly sell off on uncertainty.
Of course
It was a holiday weekend
Rise bitch rise
$DB puts boutta print tomorrow after they cut ties with Donnie Pump.
I mean Biden called him xenophobic for closing the border so you don‚Äôt think more would have died under him? What would he do in terms of planning that was better? It‚Äôs controlled on a state level
Dont trust me, look at the betting odds. This is neck and neck.
When will BABA recover?
But aren't cities blue already? It's not like current reports are red which will turn blue once we get more ballots.
take a look at eve online shpps....yes

eve has a great market pvp btw
Come around, we have good beer and wine!
I always say and will say again fuck r/politics
georgia getting very close.
With only a 100k difference between Mango and Biden currently in counted votes in GA, this might mean GA turns blue
\-250 on my book
Ah yeah dawg. I passed by there but never a patron
Some crowds are already starting to form at downtown LA LOL
Can I go back to the voting booth and change my vote?
WOW GA and NC is really close üòÆ

Who knew counting votes means dragging it out.
Always has been

Why are people so certain of Trump victory?? Looks really close to me
Betting odds are just as much about evening out the book as they are about favourite / underdog.
Wait, why is my peepee deflating?

no way to know that yet
/nq looking like a penny stock
Mail in ballots - 2.6mil in PA that need to be counted. Those lean strong dem. MI amd WI showing Trump leading still have mail in votes to count tonight too. Really leaning Biden right now.
No I just hate having to listen to dumbasses political opinions. I don't give a shit what side, people care too much and act like junior high douchebags

A milli Philly votes to be counted so nah not yet.
I'm in on APHA 4.5 and 5.0 c right now
yeah people were saying that. I just didn‚Äôt realize it would all come down to this.
People who have lives and other shit to do tend to vote blue what can I say?
In 2016 the betting sides predicted Hillary by a landslide. We all know how that went...
Goodnight bb üòò
4% drop in s and p idk past few days made 10% doing fine over here. Buy low sell high I bought low most things recovered s good 6-7% past couple days dk what's to know
this is what happens when a sub gets big enough to reach the front page, and Rpolitics invades.

Damn if votes around Atlanta counties catch up, it gives Biden a good shot at GA, that would end this before even PA gets done counting
Wasn't mango supposed to make a statement like an hour ago?
Never been there, but been to Tattletales. Classy joint.
Honestly, didn't know any better at the time of application
This betting site loses significant amounts of money on a daily basis, I don't see why they would be any different.
This sub was always retarded in a funny way but now with shit memes like this lately it‚Äôs become retarded in a 9gag kind of way. Good job mods
lmao wtf are you talking about? most of us are at home
270 to 268
Bovada getting it wrong on this one... let‚Äôs be honest, Trump ain‚Äôt getting GA and NC.  He‚Äôll probably get one, but then still needs WI, MI, and PA.  It‚Äôs not happening.
Trump campaign thinks MI going to Biden.  Why they were pissed about Fox declaring Arizona so early.
I wish I lived on the west coast
It will be over by open.
Baby steps
Yo this is racist but funny AF üòÇ
Yo I'm calling it: Biden is actually gonna pull off an upset in Georgia.

With 91% of the vote in, almost all remaining votes to be tallied are coming from 3 counties: Fulton, Dekalb, and Cobb:

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/georgia-president-results

These are all downtown atlanta or metro atlanta, and they are all heavily favoring Biden (especially Dekalb and Fulton, which are 83% and 73% for Biden respectively). The fact that the race is even almost close with pretty much all of rural GA tallied is absolutely insane.

There's gonna be a vote dump from Atlanta that send GA blue. 

dont @ me
I dunno someone else told me that when I asked earlier. I've never voted overseas myself so I have no idea.
There's a ton of mail in votes not counted for.

Mail in ballots gonna make or break it for Mango
That‚Äôs a big gap
Mail-in voting has become a form of protest between the left and right after Trump politicized it. Democrats made it a point to vote by mail and republicans vice versa. Most of these mail in votes are blue
He‚Äôs not winning PA though
Go back to your state subsidized chain masturbation
Probably not but definitely getting interesting
A lot of the ballots from big cities hasn‚Äôt been counted yet.
Uh GA is going blue.
Except if Trump lost boomer GA, that affects how he performed in the 3 states that matter.

not finding out tonight maybe tomorrow

Nah he likes printing crisp dollar bills or ballots in the printer. He is best at it
Imma call it a night

Goodnight ladies and gentlemans
Wut.  Bidens at 224.  With AZ and NV that's 16 to give him 240.  With Main that's 244.  PA puts him at 271.
honestly, i dont care who wins. just give me tendies tomorrow, is that too much to ask for : (
you definitely do not. you request an absentee ballot and vote by mail.

source: me
I prefer üò¥ over ü•≠ but how tf are you guys so confident on him getting 2 of GA, PA, MI, NC!!


He's trailing by a decent margin if these numbers on CBS are right.

Do you usually trade futures? I mainly scalp futures and even I'm staying out. Although, looking at the trades I would've taken, they all would've worked out. Would rather be safe than sorry though.
Trump win fake out like an earnings play that pops off only to go down
He's yelling something about 'Poles', I dunno what Poland did but apparently it's trying to steal the election
GA 93% reported in - 50.7% Trump to 48.1% Biden difference of 118,000 votes
What would have been different if someone else was in? Americans still wouldn't wear masks or stay on lockdown. Would probably resist even more so if Hillary told them they had to
Do you know if this chart is accurate? : [https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/general-results](https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/general-results)

says that 88% of total votes have been counted in WI. And 93% in GA. Seems like there's just a few hundred thousand mail-in votes left in those states?

If I'm reading those stats right though.
Still doesn‚Äôt change what I said about the data
2022
He's a 95% lock for AZ and NE-02, so his paths are to win 2/5 of MI / WI / PA / GA / NC

Based on where the vote is left to come in, NYT is projecting that biden is more likely to win at the moment
Holy fuck i thought they were bullshitting about mail-in/early voting going for biden

That‚Äôs not what the betting sites say
Joe diamond hands Biden
Well that‚Äôs a stupid fucking reason
16% is an interception ? Biden must be up by 4 TDs then
within a week or two. so youre half right. but theres no guarantee trump wins, and also theres no guarantee pelosi agrees to the bill, can be another stalemate

the way you said it in the original comment, made me think both sides agreed.
Meh, sure they called Texas and New Hampshire but the gaps are pretty wide in those states, so that seems about right.

Anyone else feel like this electoral college shit seems unfair as fuck?  Earlier Biden was leading the EC even though he had less votes than Mango. In states like CA or TX you got a shitton of voters but \~50% of them are practically invalidated and overruled by the EC

I dunno, just seems like a real flawed system
So, next to neck.
I'm glad you made a post about how the market is responding then

This guy is asking the real questions.
Imagine thinking Biden was a perfect candidate...
Are they leaning towards one side too much?
Georgia actually close
What do you know that nobody else does???
The deciding votes will most likely be the counties that have Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia
Yes...yes it is. If the gap widens as reporting % goes up, the certainty of the leading candidate goes up. Because there is more data that consistently shows the same results
Just wait for Austin to be the new SF and voila flip

You're getting the downvotes because it's an incredibly weak attempt at trolling lol
Maybe they big boys are playing all of us. Get us drinking and staying up late watching this shit only to miss the market moves at 9:30.
He already won NE-2 FYI.

Your 1st scenario is very possible and that could get it to 270-268 I believe? In which case Trump is definitely also going to complain about why Nebraska changed their rules.
Holy moly vix is green.

A shit ton there too

huh, they stopped counting check back in the morning
Any chance VIX is gonna hit $50 tomorrow off Mango's insanity?

It overrides an earlier ruling and makes it near impossible to reverse the decision. I personally think the stock dropped with the expectation that they would have to classify drivers as employees and now they don‚Äôt do they may rise again. They have risen the past 2 days as polls showed a yes leaning outcome
The most popular topics there are the squad being re-elected in their ultra safe districts. Really should just reroute r/politics to an official green new deal or democratic socialists sub.

About 351k votes left in Georgia. Biden needs to win about 67% of the remaining looking okay for trump but not out of the woods yet
Louisiana passed it for almost all parishes (equivalent to counties in other states).
Preach.

Idk wtf could bring this country together at this point.

There was money to be made on that betting line a few minutes ago... GA +300 Biden...
Thats not how it works
Biden basically has three ‚Äúeasy‚Äù paths to victory remaining. In rough order of likelihood: 1) Win Arizona and NE-02, hold Michigan and Wisconsin; 2) Win Pennsylvania, hold Michigan and Wisconsin; 3) Win Georgia, hold Michigan and Wisconsin.

Stop loss keep getting triggered no matter which way I go ü§°
Why the fuck is NYT still reporting biden tilting GA? They just updated it a second ago with 91 percent reported.
Priced in
Georgia close as shit 93%
Blows my mind that Dems talk about that kind of thing still.  Dems don‚Äôt care enough to be motivated by it, and Repubs hate it enough to show up in droves.  It‚Äôs a losing issue.
Nope
Also, all it takes is a few large entities to sell for other large entities to do risk-assessments, and try to 'cut their losses' by selling short;  It happened before, and will happen again.  What you're saying is that the market will forever, and always go up which is a bit absurd of a statement.  Greedy people will always be greedy, and a large part of that is self preservation when things go awry.

Not even with the 1 trump got in Maine?
not true. Trump said he will pass it instantly after office if he wins. Biden says it will be passed after Jan if he wins.

Both sides want their own version of the bill, is why
A lot in michigan, pensilvania, wisconsin and georgia. those will be the states that decide who will win

we luckily wont know until tomorrow at the earliest

NOT

yeah, the routes are BEFORE the election when you are making decisions on how to deploy resources. Well it doesn't matter anyway cause Biden hid in his basement. No one votes for a guy during a national emergency who hides in their basement so THEY won't get sick so they can be healthy so THEY can be President. The votes are all in, there are no routes at play. The die is cast already.
It buys them a little more time to figure it out. If California voted no then it would be the beginning of the end.
You sure about that?

Fucking this. 

Advocating that people should lose their vote even if they voted before the Election Day just because states have shitty election laws should be clear to anyone who actually wants to live in a democracy that person is not a good person.

And guarantee a Trump win? Sometimes making nice with your enemies is necessary when there are bigger issues at hand.
That's a terrible argument.  Everyone knew Stalin's name in the USSR.  Name recognition is just as much an indicator of excessive power and entrenched corruption as anything else.  The only reps you really need to know are the ones you vote for.  Plenty more you'll hear about in the news, e.g. AOC.

Term limits prevent the formation of a permanent ruling class and the gradual development of corrupt relationships and complete control over the system.
For some reason I don‚Äôt think it will make a difference, what would change?

Trump -200 now.  The odds makers are very good at their jobs...
"Votes cannot be cast after the polls are closed!" These mail in votes were cast days ago, the people shouldn't lose their right to vote because the state takes forever to count. Also you can technically vote after the polls close, as long as you're in line.
I'm guessing it involves a lot of goose stepping and swastikas
In what universe?
cool TED talk lmao who cares about a shit take, no need to apologize for it
Single-issue voters are awesome. Very helpful citizens to us all.

[deleted]
Hey now I'm more than happy to have some of your fd's I sell you hit. I just like my odds selling them better than buying them
You mean how tech is leading by a lot?
Who cares
PA is going to be extremely tight. There are 1.5m mail in ballots from registered Democrats, and 600k from registered Republicans. That means Trump needs a roughly 900k lead to overcome the mail in ballots. Now that's possible based on the current numbers, though it looks like he will narrowly miss. He will probably need a significant number of Democrats to cross party lines (unlikely) or votes to be disqualified (somewhat more likely), however PA is no longer rejecting votes based on signatures not matching, so I wouldn't count on that.

There are also \~800k additional ballots that were requested, but have not yet been turned in. A judge ruled that if the ballot is postmarked 11/3, it is valid if it arrives by Friday.

PA will come down to the wire, and it will be an absolute clusterfuck.
Imagine buying nasdaq futures at +4% and being wiped out within an hour by futures still +2%
NC is close, Wis too
LMAO at the 180 odd flip from 8:00 PM to now

Idk I think they should be updated but a touch of the classics in them.
Everyone is pretending it‚Äôs like the super bowl, dissecting plays, but the whole thing is realistically coming down to two fucking states (Wisconsin and Michigan) and they‚Äôre still counting Mail-in ballots because they‚Äôre slow AF. It will take days or weeks, but the media doesn‚Äôt want your eyeballs off the updates quite yet
Yes
So sick. I‚Äôd be down for that to happen everywhere
I‚Äôll give you 3 guesses what I do for a living
fair enough lol
Guys, it‚Äôs pretty simple, Biden is gonna win PA, it‚Äôs just gonna take a few days and historically intense legal battles, maybe interspersed with violent protests, the moral of the story is: puts
Got a feeling we ending up with the exact same government we have now. Dem house, republican senate and trump. Two more years of nothing getting passed and gridlock. 

Yay

Let‚Äôs go ATL
My analysis at the beginning of the night gave me a 91% chance of Biden winning if he wins AZ and NE 2nd and Trump takes the rest of the sunbelt.

99% if Biden takes Georgia as well.

Obviously any analysis can easily be wrong but if you‚Äôre 100% confident in a candidate winning right now: you‚Äôre wrong.
If there‚Äôs a tie, house will decide and Trump will win. Look at how the house decides. It‚Äôs one delegate from each state. There are more Republican states than Democrat states.
AOC 2024 only way to save the party
Started when the DNC forced Biden as the candidate
How so?

Postal system got fucked.
Lol not really any loss to take 

Just stoking the fire
I think Biden is still winning with millions of mail in ballots and early voting remaining to be counted.
I bet Victoria Justice feels amazing
What else is he going to do when the other side is Mango?
I‚Äôm seeing multiple numbers reported lol
Corona was priced in for Airlines.  Uber got hit but recovered.  2nd wave isn't priced In for shit.
Not just people I know personally. Every liberal celebrity and influencer has been heavily advocating for mail in voting, meanwhile republicans have made it almost a protest against Covid to vote in person.

There are no "routes." Your analogy like you are a car driver and if one road is blocked you can take the other is erroneous. You can't make any decisions or changes, the election is over, all the votes are in. Whoever won, won. There's no routes, just the winner.

States were not ready for all the mail in ballots since it was done quickly due to corona. PA had a very stupid rule that they couldn't even start counting them until the polls were closed

fake news, all the votes be counted tomorrow. the number of votes in the mail outstanding will be tiny. Whoever is winning the State tomorrow will be the winner.
Biden managed to barely win that 1 electoral college vote in Nebraska (Trump won the other 4). But that guarantees a tie cannot happen now.

I‚Äôm gonna take this opportunity of not getting banned and being a lil drunk to say while I disagree with Republican ideals I could accept a Republican president. But Trump? Really? He has easily been the shittiest, most moronic, controversial, ineffective president in recent history and has indirectly led to the death of many via covid cases. He doesn‚Äôt even advance Republican ideals that much aside from assigning supreme court justices. He actually just sucks at his job and the fact that he has fans just goes to show how much people have drank the koolaid. Y‚Äôall deserve better.

Why do we have a popular vote if electoral votes is all that matters
And Wisconsin
I mean this will all honesty and sincerity. Is that something you're surprised by? It's be clear as day that he would do everything he could to make sure legally submitted votes wouldn't count.
The rich
All red areas are 98% counted but the biggest city's in PA have only been counted for 40% and they heavily favor Biden with mail-in ballots. Biden's winning PA
Da fuq state do you live in where you can't access a gambling site?
Anyone who is a Bernie fan will tell you the same thing. They know who the better candidate was, they just don‚Äôt want to relinquish any power over the party.
Yeah, would definitely have not mattered
Holy fuck no way

They haven‚Äôt tanked anything, looks like Biden is slightly favored to win still.
I would nut
That would seem obvious so no.
No president until January. Fucked.
Those aren‚Äôt even the right numbers
Do you really think politicians would do that? Just go to the American people and tell lies?
I truly don‚Äôt know what to think from all this rn, just praying my TSLA calls were a good choice for this election lol
News flash, america was already great, and will be the greatest, we dont need a tv personality who cant even put up a proper sentence in english to make it great GG
Priced in
First time?
Drove by the polls in PA and there were cars still dropping off ballots @ 11 or so
Either way you lose
GA and NC are pretty safe for Trump currently, PA could go to Biden imo
Nio tank.  You can't have three days up.  That's not fair. To my puts
I feel ya
Yes
NE 2nd to Biden. No way a tie happens now.
Biden winning
Wrong. House decides pres if tie meaning Biden pres.
It will be close
Theoretically, Sleepy Joe should be winning this by a landslide, right??? ü§£ü§£

If Trump is reelected, I see the market exploding like a 21 year old man on Dec 1.

Spot on, fuck unpopular. If they really wanted to win, Biden wouldn‚Äôt have been their top pick.
Called it from the start. This ones going to be messy.
They already have them, they just have not been counted
Fox polling is the best there is by a landslide
Oh no. 3 months of we are getting closer and more phone sex
You should wear a tin foil hat because you‚Äôre extra special
1.6 million mail-in ballots for Dems and 260,000 NPA ballots with only 580,000 repubs.

That‚Äôs definitely an amount that would swing it towards Biden.

There‚Äôs a reason it hasn‚Äôt been called yet.
They don‚Äôt even try to hide it - and I say this as a europoor.
yes, but here's a fun fact. the votes are already cast, the same person won now and will tomorrow and next week. so you can count forever, the winner is the same.

Super bearish. I want out of my calls. A narrow Biden win is the worst for the market.
The good old days in April and May, that was the norm.

What the actual fuck, 280 and 369? Thanks THAT HELPS
Kinda getting a little biased vibes too but I think he‚Äôs just trying to appeal to the popular vote currently which is being lead by Biden
[removed]
Right in the pockets I bet
for real, how fucked will the market be tomorrow?
It sold off because Biden was the favorite to win by a mile.

Now the market is going to moon ... again!
If only you knew how bad my models really are.
So we fucking drill if at 9:29 there is no call correct?

What??  Lay off the conspiracy porn
I think I'll just continue about my business but good luck
anyone know how accurate that Fox News electoral college map is? looks like Mango will need both GA, NC, PA and either MI, WI and NV to win

Looks like this could be real tight. I smell lawsuits and it will probably be settled by SCOTUS?
Ok thanks
When Mango hears how many mail in votes there are for Mich and Wisconsin and even NC, expect the Twitter T&Cs to be put into conflict...

Blame Bernie. In the primary Bernie had 15% support that would not go anywhere. There were like 6+ other people running to split the rest of the vote. Bernie was going to win it even though most Democrats didn't want him. So everyone else dropped out to make Biden win instead.

By noon, Trump will declare himself the winner by discounting mail in ballots in WI, MI and PA.

Rioting will start, case will go to Supreme Court.

Supreme Court will not uphold his case, Biden declared winner.

Post Inauguration - Trump charged by Federal Court as "indicted person X".  Trump and Trump Organization charged for financial and wire fraud in NY State Court.  

Rest of Trump family and cronies make deals with prosecutors, Trump goes to jail pennyless

This hardware is situated so that it can react directly with buy and sell orders in nanoseconds. The players can make more money when the bid-ask spreads are large, and they can take on a reasonable short-term inventory hoping for additional directional profit and sell at worst at a scratch.

So Pennsylvania is allowing votes to come in after the polls are closed? Sounds criminal to me
Fuck man, it is obviously not possible to win Georgia. Im just saying the obvious the only way dems can pull of a win is to start a civil war by declaring ballots 48% of voters don't agree with post election when republicans control the courts.
He‚Äôd claim he was always in favor of mail in ballots
So fucking glad I held onto tech...
Polls did not, the aggregate did. Within margin of error it‚Äôs a tossup slightly favoriting Biden
By that logic any vote for a losing candidate is thrown away. In this case voting for Biden was throwing away your vote.

If mail-in ballots pushed Trump over the edge, do you think Trump would say they‚Äôre bullshit then?
Biden still might win massachusetts
you vote libertarian not to win but to send a message. If they increase their vote count every year eventually they will have to be taken seriously
Sir, this is the bread line...

Donate to your local food bank.
Didn‚Äôt see anyone calling for a trump landslide
Super freaky
I heard Trump has lil pimp's songs on his spotify playlist.
Maybe but it‚Äôll be rocky for us until he does.
Hopeful for be4 election
Democrats are fucking idiots.
And in the process they threw away their vote
The guy has been transparent as glass though. For all his faults he‚Äôs exactly who he‚Äôs been since day 1.
You're aware several states including PA it was Republicans that set regulations so they couldn't start counting the mail ins early
If i was american, I would have too.
[deleted]
That's called di-a-betus.
And when it‚Äôs finally confirmed he won the rest of the states it‚Äôll moon again. Holding my Friday calls until Friday this time for sure
Literally half the state lives in the Atlanta metro area.
Now that I think about it...markets are gonna be flat arent they lol
oh fuck, twitter flagged trump's tweet. puts on them
$100 on Trump winning PA, but by <120,000 votes
I love my nigga Lester
Ok put 5k on Biden, free money
That split Nebraska vote could be important somehow. One of the few states who doesn't give majority all of the states votes.
Welcome to our ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù
Bro is Georgia gunna swing or not? NYT just updated saying leaning biden.
You're telling me an election fried this rice?
Trump won it dude.
The June riots hurt the democrats too. Try to be a bit more intelligent

You put in 47 yrs of political work and a recent VP, you get appointed
ultimate cuck in all of this. no balls dnc shill
Voted for him but god I wish he wasn‚Äôt so lame üò≠
Thank you.  Got work in the morning.
Surprise motherfucker
Why are you booing? I‚Äôm right.
Here's me thinking you are all writing poles cause wsb is retarded. Nah that's just the president that started that
Was seeing the long ass line and thinking that probably someone has been waiting hours to vote for kanye.
Same with trump landslide. Both incredibly stupid at this point
Why would u watch CNBC for politics? Shepherd smith is shit
Lol

Oh wow texas what a suprise
Don't think it's being properly called yet since PA & Georgia stopped counting
"I will be making a statement tonight. A big WIN!" -djt
It's still not over, biden will win, fuck you maggots!
Britney hot af
They come from old money?
Probably not. Pennsylvania will be a huge factor on who will win and they said that they won‚Äôt be able to count all of their mail in ballots until Thursday or Friday
I‚Äôve never seen a democrat employ the ‚Äútrade talks going well‚Äù tactic this well though
It was clearly the obvious out come. But polls and all that
Honestly Lester Holt and this other dude are convincing me Biden might edge it out I‚Äôm more confused than ever.. great
I pumped it. üòé
In 2016 they called NC for Clinton., a few hours later retracted, when dust settled ü•≠ won by 4%
He thinks we vote at strip clubs
This is the biggest fact I‚Äôve seen on this sub all multi millionaires I know dropped out or didn‚Äôt go it‚Äôs not worth it
Please no, my ass still hurts from the last time I bag held.
GA had a water issue and stopped counting
Bought GEO calls yesterday, so glad I held aha.. gonna buy $LMT market open Tommorow, and also $GUSH $JPM
No he wouldn‚Äôt, he would suck joes dick and retweet it
In 47 minutes they will have new info cementing The Donald's wins in PA, GA, and MI and say he is on a clear path to victory.

Or maybe not idk
RemindMe! Friday 9:30am ‚Äúwas it obvious?‚Äù
Georgia might be fucked if 61% of the remaining vote is Biden. Could be bad boys
Completely wrong bro
Classic retard dems
If both presidential candidates and their running mates all hooked up for an airtight gangbang.  Which dude would get which hole. Only rule is you cant switch holes.I predict
Pence - ass
Biden - pussy
Trump - mouth
Smart people tend to be close to the center... only true retards are truly far right or left
It was gonna be Bernie until some rich people got involved.
Nate Silver bout to apply for jobs at Wendy's
good night
Fuck I was about to then GA came into play.
now you have a president with power again that will hammer congress into submission.
The major news outlets had everyone thinking Biden was winning easy. Polls stated 90% chance of Biden win lmao
gg Texas we‚Äôll get em next time
Are you gathering this from only swing states? If not, you‚Äôre wrong. Voting third party in an already *predecided* red/blue state is actually rather helpful to get that representation. I agree it is a waste in a swing state, though.
Ruh roh
i have no fucking clue
democrat neoliberals dont want to surrender the party to socialists
Everyone was too busy betting on the election to actually vote.
the CIA cant risk another trump presidency, sorry bud
I get that, but that's not a world we should have to live in.  I'd love to see volatility in markets competing for scientific breakthroughs -- not volatility based on tweets.

Electoral number for Trump finally updated. Looks a lot closer now.
You say that till you realize almost every dem over 25 would rather have Biden. Nothing against Bernie tho

Trump going to look like a fool if Biden wins. Donald pretty much said he didn‚Äôt want the rest of votes counted because it‚Äôs cheating. Shows he‚Äôs scared and if he tries to power grab without the results being in... that sounds like Putin. Jesus fuck I used to actually like trump too. What the hell was I thinking
Lol at those poor phaggets honking at a dementia patient sadly declaring a premature win to an office he has no business pursuing.
hurts more when it wasn't even close.
That definitely didn't help! I think the rioting and cancel culture insanity was the nail though
Unless it‚Äôs Ivanka
Yea McConnell is fucking depressing
Brit Hume reading a tweet on air is like all of us watching our dads try to find a funny meme on Facebook we saw 3 years ago.
They do this all the time with foreign governments trying rig their elections, just didn‚Äôt expect to see it happen from the president

Actually different states have different rules, some postmark by today, some arrive by today.

Almost like they were scheming this whole time
Biden needs one of MI or GA, otherwise four more years.
Our jewish boi would‚Äôve pump the market non stop no shame
Fox is the fucking money with calling the results.
[deleted]
What about the FOMC meeting and the house going to the dems and senate going to the republicans again. Essentially giving us another stalemate in stimulus negations.
SHIT
Because he was misleading about election results
MED RIRAGE. Did I do it right?
Twitter has no place censoring ANY CANDIDATE ffs this shit needs to stop
Yea I am, if trump wins NC as projected, and biden wins Georgia then biden only needs one of PA, WI, MI in order to win

all with historical early voter turnouts who are historically blue.
So... 1% green
Did they redeclare AZ?
Womp Womp.. Nio's been doing great under T, he knows what happens when he messes w chx and the market tanks.. and it would do fine under B
Apparently PA didn‚Äôt factor in the majority of mail in ballots which tends to favor democrats, some 3 million outstanding.
Im gonna inverse that thought
PA, MI, and WI are 100% not a lock for Trump.  

I‚Äôm not trying to be super pro-Biden but when everyone here can‚Äôt help but claim ridiculous things, it‚Äôs hard not to.
Trump won...GGs Biden you fought the good fight
How about instead of a gay pre-ejaculation thread you bring back gay mods, this sub is just one pile of shit memes since they removed rules you fucking gay fucks you
No he didn‚Äôt.

He said votes can‚Äôt be cast after the polls are closed. Which is reasonable lol
Corrupt Democratic Party
Bullshit they demand for patience when PA vote counters taking union breaks
Come on Don
Go to sleep, PA & Georgia stopped counting
[deleted]
I like how that's your reply, instead of disbuting the fact that trump is almost always late.
[deleted]
Donnie doesn‚Äôt want anyone grabbing his pole
Trump has Supreme Court in his corner. Gonna go to bed and sleep good knowing that
Okay now that there is no question about Daddy T winning can we go back to +4% futures?
holy shit! you know what, i'm from da south and I like im grits thicc, but not that kinda thick! heheh

tomorrow is gonna be a shit show
He said he‚Äôs up, not that he‚Äôs won.
Blue wave rollin
Stocks still go up if biden wins
Idk i kinda like this guy he‚Äôs got a manic energy and he‚Äôs going crazy on the board
Why does CNBC dick ride Chamath all the time
AZ I'm pretty sure is Biden's, seems cut-and-dry to me...MI and I think GA go to The Donald as well, there's just not enough left to swing it. WI I'm pretty sure will go to Biden. They're pretty blue and had a ton of mail-ins.
Colombia about to get a great trade deal
if Andrew Yang was in the game\*
Atlanta was waiting to see how many votes they needed.
2 mil+ mail in ballots
Everybody focused on presidentials but the fact Graham and McConnel won really kinda sucks...
Jak siƒô masz kurwa
Eh.. 64% done and Trump is at 56%.  I'd say he's got it.  Biden needed PA or NC and it's not happening unfortunately.  I fucking hate Trump but this election map is going to look just like Hilary's
Or they were hoping that enough people would show they aren't interested in what the two parties are selling
You don't know who I voted for. All I did was voice a real concern that I have based on what our current POTUS himself said, and you went off the rails.
Bernie would have blown this fool out
Right, but if trump loses Arizona his path becomes much tougher. He‚Äôd need a few Midwest states instead of a couple.

The news was reporting as if trump already lost Arizona and they (election officials) came out and said Arizona is still in play.
Fox is the way. Seriously.
Sorry I'll take a break. Thanks for the warning. I will go in time out.
5% reporting - too soon
should print i think. yuan fell the moment it looked like donnie was winning. trade war is gonna douse that flame
No I know that but I'm saying NYT should have known earlier there was still Atlanta left to count too and it was giving Trump 90%. Unless they suddenly realized in the middle of their prediction that it was the case and all of a sudden changed it.
Means we could see a stimulus during the lame duck session while both parties can try to get stuff they want in. Potentially.
Democrats rather risk losing election than let Bernie run
Cities tend to have a lot of people in them
So it‚Äôs misinfo kus each states laws are different?? I don‚Äôt get it
Gov not working = good 4 tech?
Biden is just going to hamstring our economy while China proceeds to overfish waters everywhere (they're already doing this off the coasts of central and South America) and emit carbon like crazy. The USA will end up poor, and the planet will be just as fucked.
Trump won't win if Bernie was in the game
[deleted]
He already claimed victory on twitter. He'll be talking in a bit.
Lol at everyone saying landslide Biden victory. Buncha dumbasses
I don't care who wins. I just did the basic math.

Won't know georgia till tomorrow morning
On what tho? Why would that happen
Trump has the popular pole
So glad I'm watching Bloomberg's coverage. Much more classy.
Right but you got the biggest blue country in GA left
Pretty much - probably still Biden though
https://video.foxnews.com/v/5614615980001#sp=watch-live
He is most likely one of twitter mvp if not the most popular user. I have a twitter account just to follow him. He is great entertainment.
will we have a better idea of who's winning tonight or should i go to sleep?
No. A clear result. Either way is what the market wants.
I think tech mostly loved the fact that dems aren‚Äôt going to take the senate.
No guns with Biden tho :(
CDPR lookin cheap
wow that‚Äôs actually a huge pass
Donnie should have been nicer to JPOW cause he's know printing ballots for Biden.
Beat them at their own game lol
Exactly my thought process. Thank you. I even accounted for 75% Biden votes and Trump still wins Georgia.
Also I love you
Won't be poopin till Friday
[deleted]
Its scary how ü•≠s been against mail-in the entire election and how accurate he has been.
üí∞ üí∞
I meant likelihood to win. Due to Atlanta and surrounding counties.
Psst I know who wins but I ain't telling üôä
Nyt is reporting
This guy knows
I‚Äôm confused. Betting odds favor Trump but looking at these states, it favors Biden? But if Biden wins those states, he wins the presidency.
Of course I am, Ive never been so offended in my life, isn‚Äôt that the trend with u Biden people ? Get offended by everything üòÇ fucken pansy
Tell that to Hillary
Fuck that guy
I don‚Äôt think anyone really thought it was going blue a lot of us were surprised how close it is to becoming purple
it's Variability Separatist
I meant likelihood to win.
Good info.
Also not a monolith
Red mirage, it‚Äôs Election Day not deciding day. He could still win it will be close
Just saw on nbc 3 min ago
Michigan said they might need to go into Friday to count. We don't know shit tonight
More volatility, this is basic shit dude.
Yeah this just means the riots are gonna be worse when dems realize they had the majority vote but our fucked up ancient voting system elects the other guy.
So over 2 million people threw away their votes because they thought it would be funny to vote third party lol
Senate will probably be Republican which means even if Biden wins the presidency he can't do anything.
I want out of my non-tech calls at open.

A measley 4 when these juicy 30s are up for grabs
literally armed skirmishes in the streets

Have you ever been to Atlanta? Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs mostly a demographic that doesn‚Äôt typically see eye to eye with ü•≠
Arizona retracted?
He didn't win yet he'd do the same thing if Biden declared victory you retard
When you think you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre wrong; when you think you‚Äôre wrong, you‚Äôre right. Tomorrow is a big day for us putters fellow autist. The market never does what you expect, now shh let me sleep with these thoughts
Yes ignorance is bliss

Cuz I‚Äôm up right now

If trump wins he‚Äôll be going on a warpath against them.
tbf i think this sub only has a boner for him ironically. it's like elon but we actually like elon.  trump creates this chaos that makes the market interesting.  it's also an escape from the bullshit that we gotta deal w/ when we wake up.
Either Nevada‚Äôs vote counter is jammed, or the staff took a lunch break in Vegas.

Atlanta and surrounding counties still haven‚Äôt reported a lot.
Do you realize this is true only because everyone else thinks it is and accepts it?

How do i change to easy mode?

Hard mode isn't fun anymore
Maybe they will close the market tmrw
I got a $15 coupon. The burger was cold, fries were stale, and the soda was watered down and uncarbonated.
I see, but (not an expert lol) it really doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be enough to change Georgia blue, even when being really *liberal* in my calculations

Trump gets GA but biden AZ I thinj
Not just reddit. Every empirical measurement suggested it would not be this close.
NBC is shit. Some bearded ginger stuttering bullshit.
Well that's not even close to the case right now.
Yea he really doesn‚Äôt have a chance in PA, from my understanding as of now.

He could still get AZ, GA, MI and WI due to mail-in?
[deleted]
They are both corrupt idiots.

Are you a moron?
Prob 22 passed so def calls on uber

Lyft still sucks without eats
So we now know that calls are pro Trump and puts are pro Biden right ?
Not really. Wasnt Blue on any map I've seen
We all could speak his name until he crashed the market for the second time then he became mango. Not sure why not orange but mango has a nice ring to it.
Thank you. You‚Äôve made my night/morning!!
no. he's saying that he won't peacefully transfer power cause if he loses he will unequivocally deem it fraudulent.
Just type in Trump live and click the live stream
Good luck!
Nice
Even worse, how are you a dem claiming that trump won obviously when its clear as day how competitive this race is?
[removed]
True, but many americans are still jobless.  How much money printing will it take to save the economy?  Artificial inflation is a short term fix to a long term problem.
Tech futures up bigly.
These loser ass reporters are trying to create symbolic references to what trump does and how everyone views his actions, i.e. ripping off a mask after being treated for covid. 

These statements sound roughly equivalent to a high schooler trying to present a report on which Dr. Seuss character is the most Christ like figure in a shitty, forced, essay in an analytical reading class. 

I fucking hate these reporters so much. The depth of their thoughts are so shallow and blatantly retarded.
Already doubled my $ on predictit.org.  Maga bitches
Okay so I was here for the üçä period. Got really confused when it switched to ü•≠. I think this means I‚Äôm not cool anymore

No one really thought Texas was gonna be blue. It was just a hail mary outlier "maybe."

The fact that it's so close should concern your party, though. If it does ever flip blue, Republicans will legit never be able to win an election again. Texas + NY + Cali = complete monopoly on US politics.
ü§£üëç
Also so when he loses he can pretend his first victory was legit.
What if üçä was actually talking about the stock market in Poland?
Hahaha you couldn‚Äôt be more wrong

NYT sees GA tilting biden
hey thats the Twitch Brian voice
Think the idea is trump is gonna declare victory before all the votes are counted resulting in a contested election and then more chaos, which in theory means down fo stocks but who knows what's gonna happen
i thought biden gonna win but dam was i wrong
Once elections blow over next week I‚Äôm gonna make a bet that if my YOLO on CRSR hits, that I‚Äôll get a nice tattoo of their logo. I‚Äôll happily be branded if my 20 year old self is right to follow my hunch

Actual DD üëç
I mean talking heads are just puppets for one side or another and while hard-pushing a narrative that isn't really backed up by the numbers, one of them was quite obviously, subconsciously displaying that everything he was saying was bullshit.

AKA Biden doesn't have a chance in PA, the narrative of mail-ins saving everything is bullshit he's being told to push.
yeah but stonks only go up so none of this matters
Well you must be a moron

You are so clueless. Market was going to melt up in either scenario. SPY is going ham this week, hold on to your bear ass
This country will be a living Wallstrretbets thread wherever you go tomorrow.
we think it's a nightmare now but imagine if biden wins by tmw evening then mail in ballots push votes red.

the shitshow that would ensue...
it‚Äôll probably happen one day tbf

How did Georgia change so suddenly? It was almost 90% chance to Trump earlier. I know there's a ton of Atlanta votes but still.
How much coke has trump done tonight

Call me a retard and make me feel at home. But why did Twitter censor trumps last tweet
Not gonna lie, no one brings a smile to my face like trump. May the poles be in your favor
Erin Burnett low key pretty hot.
Im working on it.
Only a Republican would think counting every vote is ‚Äúcheating‚Äù. Fully expecting a Florida 2000 scenario where republicans steal the election.
Work is highly overrated.
I don't think anyone is. Even Trump's tweet was only about counting votes postmarked after Election Day or submitted in person after polls closed.

Still shows Trump leading by 6% with 87% reporting
I keep googling "[state name] stock" instead of votes
But his not losing. He may win. Dear God.
This really makes me sad that this election will be as close as it is.  I know we're all on this sub to meme and make money, but shit, there's a lot of other important stuff in the world to think about.  The system we have going right now is letting the rich get exponentially richer at the expense of our planet.  

I don't know about you guys, but I'd like to have some fish in the ocean and animals on the planet in 50 years, even as I'm suffocating under the effects of runaway climate change.  

You can still make money under biden.  There's a fuckload of emerging technologies in alternative energy.

But yah.  Y'all have a boner for the cheeto.  Those of you who are trading in your 20's now, remember this post when you're 50 and fresh water is 9k per call, and it's all trading under nestle.

You can check the current mail in votes and approximately check what percentage each candidate is getting and predict based on that.
Where do you see 57% Biden?CNN says trump lead in GA still.
He said only idiots take $50k+ in debt, if you‚Äôre smart you‚Äôll go to community college for your first 2 years and save a shit ton of money and if you‚Äôre even smarter you‚Äôll just go to a local state university for your final 2 years

Reject modernity, embrace monke
exactly. why do people think republicans have been trying to invalidate and dismantle mail-in voting this entire time? obviously it favors dems strongly because their people have been listening to scientists and msm about rona
CNN just inversed Bidan then haha

Sorry for your loss, Joe. But don't worry, the nurses at the home will still salute you and call you Mr. President. Obama will stop by and bring you fruit cups, just like old times.
holy fucking shit he was behind in votes and now closed the gap because he is beating trump out in GA and just won MN. the only states left are big boi states which he is gaining votes in.

How dare you use logic! This is wsb! Lol I think Biden is stealing this election.

This shit is still as good as a coin toss
Lol GG, called it almost 3 hours ago but they really tryna push that mail-in narrative
some kind of flood or pipe burst where they were processing mail-ins in ATL. ballots not destroyed but processing delayed something like 4-6 hours.
TX to the mango, it's over.
Please stop speaking on behalf of us, solders
Oh shit 57% likelihood going for Biden in GA.

Two of the sunbelt states gives Biden a 95+% chance of winning.

Trump can‚Äôt prematurely ~~ejaculate~~ declare victory if he can‚Äôt even hold two states he really needs to win on the night of the election.

Futures will shake him off if GA goes to Biden.
Trump won, $3000 bet secured.

Bro honestly get a life and get off reddit for a bit it‚Äôll probably help your crippled brain
American soldiers don't vote for socialists.
Trump just got Texas
Rational people aren't.
This is going to go Biden unless we get a surprise in absentee ballots. In Michigan 700k out of expected 3M absentee ballots have been counted so far, 65% Biden. (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-michigan.html). Assuming that stays the same, final absentee ballot should give Biden another 500-600k advantage in votes, which should give him Michigan. Same counting principal applies to Wisconsin. PA is a tossup after absentee ballots, but Biden just needs to win NV / WI / MI at this point since he won AZ, plus the Nebraska 1st congressional district worth 1 vote, to hit exactly 270 needed to win.
What's the ticker for the most popular publicly traded ass cream producer? I feel it will be in high demand no matter whether Trump keeps this win or if mail-in flips it.
I find NIO more attractive rn at $35 that when it was at $10 months ago
https://youtu.be/oR8oIitE6mI
he‚Äôs gonna win idk why ppl can‚Äôt just let it happen it‚Äôs kinda embarrassing on the global level. just own it lmao

donnie vs china part 2
What if I told you you're retarded. Also, it's impractical.
ABC news just reported that they talked to election officials in Arizona and they haven‚Äôt counted in person voting yet in Maricopa county. In person is supposed to favor Trump. Supposed to***

They also cautioned that any projections as of a winner right now are inaccurate. If trump wins Arizona his path to victory is much much much easier and I doubt there will be much uncertainty. They said they expect a count by midnight. That‚Äôs at least what the news reported.
WI, they have not even begun to count the absentee votes. There were 1.275mil requested. If Biden wins 2/3rd of these as he has in other places, that is 400K votes his way. He currently trails Trump by 80K votes.

In PA, only 670K absentee ballots have been counted. There were 2.5mil returned. The absentee ballots counted so far broke for Biden 71.7% and 21.3% for Trump. If this were to hold, among the 1.83mil ballots still uncounted, Biden would gain 922K votes. Biden currently trail Trump by 420K votes.

This is far from over. It‚Äôs just beginning.

In Michigan, 2.48mil absentee ballots were returned, and only 426K have been counted, leaving another ~2mil to count. The ones that were counted broke for Biden 65 to 33 percent, or in theory 640K vote difference for Biden over Trump. Trump‚Äôs current lead over Biden in MI is 270K.
[deleted]
How much money is DGLY GOING TO MAKE US!? Unrest here we come.
Definitely less safe, speaking as a software engineer.  
It has to do with notions of scalability and the possibility of large-scale fraud. The very "inefficiency" of collecting and counting physical ballots has a positive effect of making large-scale fraud difficult to accomplish.   
Not so for electronic ballots. If the contractors that build the app fuck up, as in many other government tech projects, we could have a totally botched election, which would be awful.  
Better to be inefficient every 4 years than to risk that IMO.
They don‚Äôt care about soldiers anymore.
Well, my pole is UP
Imagine campaigning as a 3rd party candidate. That shit is defo a scam
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
Gives great head
That or a fair game of rock paper scissors
CNN just said PA is going Trump
Technically, yes, but seems incredibly unlikely. There are about 600k more votes to count. So Biden would need to get over 70% of them.
Did this actually offend you? Lmao
So why are we against counting mail in votes
Theta Gang
Everyone of these analysts should be required to drive from Houston to El Paso before they write a Texas swing state article lol
I know the presidential is the draw but I‚Äôve seen virtually nothing about senate races on the networks tonight and if trump wins that will be the bigger story if it flips.
Meaningless...look up the electoral college retard
Li and XPENG

But NIO has the most going for them.

No sleep tonight; Futures and WSB, what more do you need?
That makes no sense. Obviously they would have gotten it done. So would have PA.

How is that a non-excuse? 

Being able to count 3+ million mail in ballots a month before an election and not being able to count until 7am on Election Day clearly would impact the timeline of when results are announced.

They have to open up each individual ballot and feed them into the machine with likely less than 1000 people doing so. In 14~ hours until results start coming out.

How the fuck did you manage that? Albertan asking.
Biden with the reverse UNO card?
These markets are erratic. I wouldn't be so confident once this sugar high wears off.
Lol, if we closed everything after the poles closed; Biden would win... Trump's the big dumb.
Oh so that‚Äôs why Mango hates USPS.

What happened?)
I only got a Twitter for ps5 updates. Went to Donald trump and I just don‚Äôt get Twitter at all. At the top of his page are tweets from yesterday and older. But people are saying he just tweeted? Is there a sort by new? I can‚Äôt fucking figure this shit app out
Biden would drive our beautiful country into the ground he‚Äôs just as bad as Hilary if not worse

Lol, half? You must be the same guy that did all the pre-election polling.
Dude is tired as fuck. Wolf was all, you're in 2016..

Gotta fight fire with fire. If he stayed quiet and waited for Trump to do it before early ballots got counted it would have been a mistake.
Biden will need 65% of all those remaining votes to tie.
I think both sides of the aisle can agree you're a retard
Wow, could be a game-changer
Idk I'm just excited lol

Paying taxes is part of the game. The more taxes you pay, the more you can borrow. That's why I tell people tax rates don't matter. Higher taxes doesn't really matter for people like me, I'm at the top of the bracket pretty much no matter what. However, Dems tend to fill taxes with loopholes for me to get around taxes through deductions with average people assets such as real estate (which means I can tie my wealth into a larger quantity of smaller assets). 

The reason why old people from Florida care about taxes is most of them are living off passive income with no intentions of reinvesting. They actually spend the money, so it is literally taking food off their tables. That's why they care about high taxes.

As someone in my 30s. Taxes are just part of the game.

Such a damn quarrel, I'll make much more money as a ICU covid travel nurse (85k vs 148k after taxes) with Trump because he's not going to do shit about the virus so I'll keep getting these huge contract offers, but I cannot deal with these MAGA fucks, day after day.

Trumps parents only job was to keep him off the poles. 

Calls on thongs...
Many European and South American countries also decriminalized all drugs and their problem decreased dramatically. War on drugs is far worse than the actual drugs. Keeping drugs illegal just funds cartels and dealers and keeps people in vicious prison cycles. Read about it and educate yourself based on evidence.

So how do I keep printing tendies in a civil war?
one reason is they could be trying to paint Biden as favorable to prevent riots. Everybody goes to bed. Some kind of psychological thing. Fox being closer to Republican would be in a position to be asked a favor or to coordinate something like that.

Dunno otherwise. The illusion of having something you don‚Äôt when effort is involved is self destructive, so don‚Äôt know how this would help Democrats

IF there's a prolonged political ordeal, the most likely result is prolonged VIX elevation. Crash extremely unlikely, basic financial picture is unchanged.

Amen!
Y‚Äôall are worse at predicting elections than predicting stock prices. No wonder half this sub is flat broke.

I know, it just is a really good election play considering its a defensive stock. Because it deals mostly with the gov its revenue stream is really consistent, so regardless to who wins, exponentially increasing investment into defense and space will continue into the far future, particularly now where the gov is desperate to drive a business recovery (which implies a ramp up in fiscal policy) and innovation to compete with chinas increasing influence through military means and dominance in space.

AJRD will be a net positive from all this. Every sector they have their hand in is growing consistently.
Just wait til his press conference.

If he gains 600k in mail in votes for PA the country will burn to the ground, and I can exit my QQQ OTM puts unscathed

And mail in ballots are coming in at around 60 to 65% in favor of biden. This shit won't be decided for days Nd its going to be super close either way.

lol. ill see you when uber +10% tmrw dumbass
Florida was allowed to count starting on the 12th of October. PA had to wait until 7am today. They weren‚Äôt even allowed to start processing them today.

If every state had just done what Florida had done for early voting, we would be almost done by now.
Lol trump already celebrating bro. There‚Äôs no way he loses.
Oh shit Donnie knows he's losing now, crying already on twitter about the election being stolen.

You are.
GG markets. Bears win this week
Pickle burps are legit
Twitter just shut Trump up LMFAO
Biden will definitely win the popular vote by a decent margin. I wonder if the Democrats ever control both the Senate and House with a Democrat president if they‚Äôll try to amend the Constitution. Of course it‚Äôll require a few of the conservative justices to leave too.
Game - everytime u take a hit take a pug, everytime u pug take a hit
Buying puts after that fake pump today was the best decision I've ever made. Donnie is about to tank this shit and start a civil war with this mail in ballot bullshit
[deleted]
Okay Biden is too
Im drinking cause i dont have weed; take a toke for me
lol that is spot on
Harris has no shot in 24 lol, she didn't even stick around in the primary long enough to get blown out in her home state and then she hitched her raft to the sinking Biden ship 

Everything else is spot on
Arizona has stayed at 76% longer than you guys have stayed financially solvent

He‚Äôs not going to win, though.

Yup
Trump inadvertently just announced he knows he‚Äôs losing since he tweeted that.
Yea, they said in fox people who voted by mail-ins tended to be democrats

No one fucking cares about politics here. Unless you hammered Trump -160
yea you're probably right
Contested election was supposed to be the worst case scenario for the market...
Lolll you actually bet 20k that trump is going to win

It begins. Both sides gonna try and steal the election
**Tracking the mood today:**

Biden wins a landslide

Biden is winning by bigger numbers than Hillary

Biden is still winning by double digits in the polls

Biden is still winning all the swing states

Bide is still winning

Independents will break massively for Biden

Biden is behind in a few states but still has a clear path to victory

Biden can still win on election day

Biden can still win without Florida

Biden can still win without Pennsylvania

#Biden can still win with late ballots ‚è™‚óÄ‚¨Ö <--‚è™ **We are here right now**

Biden ca still win with the recount

Biden can still win with the Supreme Court

Harris will win in 2024
Here we go baby
So Biden won Arizona? Now showing up on google
Cali was red in the 80s. Things can change. But take a few generations

People not finding out, both claiming to win, and false accusations of stealing are reasons to feel like chaos is coming.
Dude on ABC said he'd much rather be in Joe Biden's position but his eyes were blinking so fast and he was literally shaking his head at the end of the sentence. Body language screaming that it's bullshit and Trump has this.
Oh dear the fat retard talking about stealing. Yikes.
Yeah dump it Donnie u dumb fuk
Bro. I live in DC. My vote does not count for shit at all.
Dude running for senate in Arizona looks Locke from lost

Trump is going to fucking crash the market if he declares victory this early, like seriously. What the fuck is he thinking
It looks like its gonna be Trump and Rep senate. We should be fine.
Trump‚Äôs speech to taking SPY to -3%
I already stress ate all my snacks, I didn't plan for the upcoming days.
Declaring victory when it‚Äôs not over is a dangerous thing to do. At least joe places some doubt in his statement but Trump literally doesn‚Äôt care about the votes of the people. Just winning. Spy puts because this is gonna get way worse
There‚Äôs that little single vote portion of Nebraska that would effectively decide it

Fox also called Virginia incredibly early. Dunno why maybe they have a numbers super genius, a cool robot, or maybe it‚Äôs fuckery. I‚Äôm leaning towards smart people if for no other reason they couldn‚Äôt really make bad calls like that and live it down or get away with it

Personal hypothesis is the urban bubble.  Implicit biases don't allow them to get a truly representative sample when they poll.  Even when they try to adjust they're just guessing.  Set up some pollsters in front of the water authority and poll people who pay their water bill with cash.  You'll get a better representation of the common man.
lol saw that on twitter
Trump is going to speak on poles
Puts on hallmark
Calls on the North and South poles
Trump is definitely coming out declaring victory. Are you ready for the greatest shit show on earth!
There‚Äôs 2 million uncounted votes and it‚Äôs supposedly around 1.5 million Biden - 500k Trump. So it‚Äôll be very close. I think Trump has a bit higher % then expected so it might actually come down to a few thousand votes.
Does not exist

We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Poles are closed!

civil war 2.0 here it comes.

California should lose 5 electoral votes for fucking up their state with homeless and taxes and making all their citizens flee to ruin other states.

It's really close guys. Gonna take a day or two to figure this one out. It really will be decided by the mail in ballots in like 3 swing states.

Called it a day or two ago. I live in CA. People are dumb, and believed all the ads n voted yes.
That just means they have retarded people in the state.  That doesn‚Äôt mean all the people in the state are regarded.
I mean it‚Äôs already been highly known that most of the mail in ballots would democratic so why is this even surprising?

Puts on the DNC tards who said we should put all our chips on Biden and pressured better candidates out.

But seriously, they should be watched to prevent them form being Epsteined.
Good post and could be an accurate prediction of the future.  Somebody end this!
this is why trump was so scared of the mail in votes and saying it should be called the nigjt of the election. 

he knows those mail ins are going to boost bidens votes big time

Obviously he was watching fox news and heard the same shit I did, and panicked. The timing is too perfect.

Look, honestly. I've voted dem before. I've voted rep before. I don't like this "two sides are enemies" thing. But, not to be dramatic, but if you legitimately support throwing out votes made by your fellow Americans just to win, then you care about your party more than you care about American democracy. And that's some authoritarian shit, and I got no patience for it.

No one should be okay with this shit Trump is attempting right now.
Jeep 100% sponsored that
This reminds me of the Tesla‚Äôs shareholder meeting lol

I lost 100k that day on calls smh
I guess we'll find out if Biden just lied through his teeth
Ok now let's hear it from Donnie

I feel like this talk was to keep spirits up but if anything it makes me more worried.  He's talking a lot about mail in votes.  Feels like they have info that he's gonna lose by the morning and gonna depend heavily on mail ins to win.
This weird Biden grin, is he having a stroke?
Imagine thinking the presidency impacts the direction of the market.

Senate is all that matters.
Wow Biden said he‚Äôs gonna win PA
sorry that was harsh

You were the one that said the Yuan was tanking. You were wrong. Good attempt at deflection but I‚Äôm not a moron like you. The yuan didn‚Äôt tank, DXY rose against the yuan. Again, you have no clue about what you‚Äôre talking about.
He‚Äôs delirious
Imagine being named Christopher Coons
He‚Äôs super likely to take Wisconsin and Michigan. PA is the super close one. That will be really contested.
Biden is winning. He‚Äôs up in the mail in ballots by 1.6 million in PA, and Wisconsin is expected to tilt to Dems. Plus he‚Äôs winning Arizona and more. You guys don‚Äôt really know much do yah
God bless Jill Biden for putting up with his senile ass
Why not?

It's kind of in the same sector, ability to market "netflix pass" to watch new movies. Netflix may have the potential to capture more profit than expense.

Box office doesn't exist anymore and hasn't since covid and the streaming platforms are generating consistent profits. Actors/actresses emerging on these streaming platforms as well.

Or any company can buy if amc if cheap enough and convert movie theatres into something else.

A company that can support amc until after covid-19 to make profit again, work deals, convert structures.

Gme got bought out by msft. Who woulda thunk?

Extremely speculative.

Edit: or play off covid-19 with safety protocols like you mentioned.
trump in shambles
He is. People failing the IQ test. 0% mail ins counted in PA and WI
Biden loses
Why not PA?
the GA votes left to count are in Atlanta...go check the Fulton county numbers and report back retards. Gonna be callled Biden

Biden looks sad af. Poor guy knows its over
That‚Äôs the narrative he‚Äôs been setting up for weeks
fk BBC rn
Where you gonna go
This is gonna get ugly.

On fox News, their election desk stats guys came on and basically said that Biden has a really good chance to win in Wisconsin and Michigan, because most outstanding votes are the mail-ins that favor Biden.

But here, everyone is acting like Biden has already lost, because the numbers right now are favoring Trump.


They are gonna count the mail-ins, call it for Biden, then the entire right is gonna be like "this is bullshit! Trump had 54% on election night! Rigged!" even though it makes perfect sense.

This is gonna be such a clusterfuck, and the president purposefully planted the seed in everyone's minds that calls made after election night are "dangerous" and absentee ballots are "dangerous" specifically because he knew this was likely to happen.

Honestly, hold your dicks. This shit is gonna get wild.

Maine is uses district method so the only blue state not yet called for Biden is AZ and those 11 votes aren‚Äôt gonna cut it.

I was consistent because I got results. Kids went from getting B-/C+ to As. Parents forced them to comes three times a week for a few hours a time even if they didn't need help. They probably also used me as a babysitters too since they worked alot and were too busy to spend time with their kids. I probably made lower 20k after taxes in high school. College was much more inconsistent because of TAs were essentially free tutors who graded your school work!

How does Trump even get a single vote? Dude is the most obvious con man in human history
Fuck Arizona. Passing a 77% increased tax on small businesses and people making over $400k a year. I‚Äôm fucking out and taking my 100s of jobs with me. Texas here we come... Sorry AZ employees of mine but I can‚Äôt afford to live here or have our headquarters here any longer :(
Vote on prop 22 passed maintaining status quo that Uber and Lyft drivers should be classified as independent contractors.
How close is it?
Won't know PA until at least Friday
Easy now. He‚Äôs pissed off the home team isn‚Äôt in his corner. Nothing is contested until the lawsuits start.

no way, my friend from Weedstocks lol!  A Biden win is good for APHA due to Kamela's pro-cannabis stance. A Biden loss and Apha will be red.

Tsla fan boys you‚Äôre losers. Ty
FLORIDA FINALLY CALLED
You will never get a response from him on that
I think we are all fukt tomorrow. Narrow Biden win is the worst case scenario.
IM JOE BIDEN AND I FORGOT THIS MESSAGE üëç
PA definitely still too close to call as well as MI. 64% of the 39% left uncounted votes in PA are in counties Clinton won in 2016.
It‚Äôs over. Official.
Who thinks it'll take PA til Wed night to finally finish 90%+ count to call it?
Florida called!
Omw to go cop some
Uber eats deliver weed
Whats that?
Lots of mail-in ballots are being projected to make a change
No
NC is close as fuck, PN still has mail ins they havent counted and so does WI
I use TDAmeritrade, But feb calls sound juicy too...
You like drinking that crazy cool-aid, huh?

And if they're majority republican, is it still cheating??

The world where there‚Äôs 0% mail in ballots counted in WI and PA which number in the millions and break for the dems 3:1 and 2:1. üôÉ
Pipes bursting in Atlanta (which is HEAVILY blue) would not favor Biden, just remember, Kemp (who's also a super red) also oversees elections as Sec of the State. If anything, this is great news for repubs.

I'm afraid I wasn't able to come through on this senate race, congratulations Mr. Uh...you know, you know the thing.
prop 22 passing
‚ÄúVoting for the candidate I don‚Äôt like = Cheating‚Äù
You can‚Äôt exercise it, since there‚Äôs no way to purchase the stock anymore. However, Robinhood should still allow you to sell your position. I had 11/6 $2 hertz puts that I cashed out on Monday up 150%.
That‚Äôs grimes my man, she‚Äôs into freaky shit.
Look at the username of reddit and most internet forums.  How many transsexuals do you know in real life? How many homosexuals? How many IT contract workers?  These three groups make up most of the mainstream subreddits and their opinions come to the forefront.  Don't rely on reddit to form your world view.
it's 2016 all over again, same states winning

Edit: Adding that you are 100% wrong
If they were big enough like that don‚Äôt you think all these news sites would have called it already.. they‚Äôre crunching numbers with hundreds of computers and you‚Äôre using that pea brain of yours
Space dust. Shit will get you drunk in a quick second
Same with supposedly defending the first amendment, but going crazy when someone kneels during the national anthem or doesn‚Äôt salute the flag. Or wanting to bring ‚Äúthe bible‚Äù into schools. The constitution applies only when it suits the agenda.

Biden fanboys annoying tf out of me, they‚Äôre relentless it‚Äôs kind of sad

if biden gets NC he wins
Appreciate it man, but my retarded ass finally got the iPad to work and give gold. Lol
my 20k bet on trump looking juicy.. knock on wood. it's all I've got.
its not pro biden tho lol
A) This isn‚Äôt the place for this

B) ‚Äúeverything I read on reddit.‚Äù Reddit is incredibly left-leaning overall, especially in r/politics

C) Biden may come off as harmless but his ambitions (such as eliminating over half of the energy sector or raising taxes) can be very unappealing to a lot of people and companies.
Bro Atlanta hasn‚Äôt even finished counting and mail in hasn‚Äôt even been touched. Stfu. We won‚Äôt know shit until tomorrow
Some counting mail-ins first, chaos
That would be fucking wild.
You lost 40k is this some kind of retard joke im not retarded enough to understand? Its free to use a stop loss did you accisently set it 40 thousand dollars to low?

Nice bait
MAIL IN BALLOTS = CHEATING
Honestly, I‚Äôm very happy he hasn‚Äôt done that. Terrible for this country and democracy if he does that. 

Even if he does win, it‚Äôs incredibly undemocratic to do something like that.
Biden going to throw in the towel in a speech coming soon. Congrats trump train. It wasn‚Äôt even close.
The "Platinum Plan" may have actually worked. I would've gone with "Iced out Initiative" but you gotta respect the hustle.

Except to the people who are projecting him winning. Won‚Äôt know for at least a day.
269/269. Then the House decides. Premiums would be so tasty.
California prop 22
Not cheating until tomorrow? Got it
Follow the numbers
I was going to stay up all night and watch the elections along with futures but fuck it, I will go to bed early instead.
Bottom line: Biden is a pussy and you don't elect a pussy to lead the greatest nation in the world. Our adversaries are not nice people.
no offense, but if he's a billionaire why did he settle for that melted snaggletoothed chucky doll
A night full of anxiety just to get up tomorrow and struggle to pay my rent. Life moves forward. The world continues to turn. And bears will always be gay. Regardless of the President, kinda sad really
Iuno how many of the votes are mail in but they‚Äôve just started coming in I think so they must still be counting them. Some of the states had rules where you couldn‚Äôt start counting them until November 3rd so it‚Äôs a lot to handcount potentially millions of votes
Nah, that's the other 75%
Fyi... During 2016 election night, futures were limit down 7% before staging a historic rally. 2.5% gain is nothing.
I'm also certainly not in retail lmfao. Haven't worked min wage in years.
Odds say:

ü•≠- 55% chance

üò¥- 45% chance

Very close
The markets had a fat orgasm earlier when it thought trump was winning
I would say what a lot of people don‚Äôt count on are those regular white dudes in the suburbs who have a business degree. They probably won‚Äôt sport a maga hat, but they‚Äôll vote for anyone who lowers taxes. Also many people discount everyone living out in god‚Äôs country who are overlooked by democratic party
TSLA!  In Elon we trust
No chance.
betting odds gonna be 50/50 in the morning maybe
Contest
Update: Fox News doubled down on Arizona for Biden. Trump is contesting because it means there is no winner tonight
Watch this end in a tie and we all won't know who won until Dec. 14. (The Electoral College deadline)
bruh where are y'all getting your news from
Yeah but in the major blue county they‚Äôve only counted 11% of the vote
So Trump -165 on Bovada now, fuck the news Vegas will tell you what is going on considering they put their $ where their mouth is
Yea this is a presidential election lmao if the poor news guys have to stand up and talk all night they can count ballots

Looks like the only way Mango can win is precisely what they called the 'Red Mirage'.

Stop all counting in WI, MI and PA and declare himself the Winner.  

Not joking, I won't be surprise if he does that.
Make them work all night I say.
That he lost
Ten to life says you're wrong.
I mean, Trump lost NY.....So no imagination necessary
So we ain't know til tomorrow at the earliest

> is reddit just another manipulated platform and I'm being fed only pro-biden threads?

Yes, Reddit is heavily astroturfed.
Did you get this from r/politics by any chance?
If we don‚Äôt have a for sure winner until Friday or something and then there AREN‚ÄôT riots, 2020 will officially be the wackest year ever. Except for when we were all making hella money a few months back
That‚Äôs a terrible comparison. The middle states hold just as much weight combined as the few big states. More like FAANG vs all other tech
Even if I smoked some they‚Äôre dead now
How confident ya feelin now?
Sorry for that. After this short squeeze positions may come back though. Biden will win this night. After winning, ftse and dax will probably surge another day and plunge like a rock the day after.
Wow...
The dementia line is sorta weak bro. The right really tried to push that, but it simply didn't stick after Biden's endless debates and townhalls and speeches that were 100% coherent.

Dude has done literally nothing to signal any signs of dementia
Lmfao cheating not done yet...got it

You called yourself a moron too

shhh, theres a reason for that.
Red? who knows
He losing bro
You misinterpreted what I said- the red mirage is that republicans voted in person & those votes get counted before prudent, democratic mail-in votes & the latter ends up flipping many of these swing states.

If Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt send his campaign manager out to say ‚Äústay tuned to Tomorrow‚Äù its a good sign for the democrats.

I'm not a legible voter so i didn't research much into which party would be more beneficial to a person of my standing, but everything i read on reddit seems to imply trump is a dangerous and greedy retard who is working for russia, a criminal, and lots of clips of trump supporters being garbage human.

on the other hand, biden's new tax laws won't affect most people and he's just a better human being in general.

can someone explain to me why trump still has so many supporters even if we don't include the MAGA neckbeards? is reddit just another manipulated platform and I'm being fed only pro-biden threads?

what does a normal average family with income less than $400k get  when trump is re-elected that makes them vote for him despite all the shits being flung at him?

I also tutored in high school and college. In high school, I was paid $35/hr for each of the two kids I would tutor two kids at the same time So effectively $70/hr. I would do my homework if they did not have any questions or difficulty so it wasn't really time I would have spent having fun. I would tutor at least three times a week for at least a few hours. This was about 15 years ago. Tutoring rich kids is so profitable! In college my hourly rate was $80/hr. It wasn't as consistent as high school since university was much more competitive with everyone being roughly equal in intellect.
But didn‚Äôt trump try to cheat by sabotaging the entire postal service since majority of mail in ballots are democratic
I heard 40k uncounted mail in votes remaining.

It‚Äôs not about puts. I‚Äôm actually long the market. It might not even tank.
it is what it is bro

They didn't start counting mail in ballots until the polls closed aka there will be a massive blue swing in both of those places. I am 99% confident Biden takes both.

Do you know a million people in PA?
They thought a red dildo earlier in the day was in better taste
He can‚Äôt.

But I hear Tonald Drump is an up and coming star in the Republican Party that may possibly run in 2024.
Y though?
hahaha this is so true. ultimately 2% of people gonna tweak but the other 98% are gonna just keep living their lives so it kinda makes sense???
We‚Äôre gonna wake up with just a lil‚Äô pump (essketit!!) huh?
My VXX 28C 11/20 looking sexy af - they have no control of this. Volatility coming in. Time for my comeback!
Let‚Äôs, as they say, fucking go!!!
I‚Äôm surprised he knows the election is tonight
Me too though honestly
Looks like Biden won NE-2 so tie now impossible. But house decides Pres if 269-269, aka Dems elect Biden. But senate decides VP, i.e. we get a Biden/Pence presidency lol.
He should stick to reviewing pizzas
**Who would win?**

Hundreds of millions of dollars spent campaigning by both candidates to elect a President

**OR**

He was never gonna get mn
Looks like trump may be losing it
Got it, nobody else saying anything yet
PA will take days
[deleted]
Based on the last 6 months no I don‚Äôt think they will get anything done. Extend the budget give themself raises change a law to fuck the poor sure the regular stuff they pass all the time will always go through. But stuff for the average person who‚Äôs either about to be homeless or has recently become homeless because their government shut everything down except Walmart target home depot and lowes? No they get a whole lot of ass raping.

Of course he didnt. He's a cowardly limpdick talking tough on the internet.  And if anyone disagrees with me I will fuck you up!
Mostly because retards from other states move there (looking at you, Ohio).

Stand down, stand by.

Buy VIX.
Lol
If you're talking about the middle states, they are literally worth like 3-5 electoral votes. It's like comparing penny stocks to big tech stocks. He's winning all the penny stocks

Fox News retracting the AZ call.

Edit: Fake News. Still Biden
Horseshit. There was no definitive answer during the market hour so why it rallied then?
How is counting all the ballots cheating lol
So true it hurts
It‚Äôs past Bidens bed time
Many states didn‚Äôt allow that.
[deleted]
God I hope not.
so who wins if its a tie?
Biden potentially about the speak ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. Presumably about contesting results or holding strong.
Imagine being a bear and voting for pumperino
Why has a campaign not hit on this for donations!?
No what I mean is that 64% of that 39% total left uncounted votes are in counties Clinton won in 2016.
lol I feel you I only have one other play i've been this confident about besides PLTR, and it hasn't even entered the market yet. But ye I just hope it kinda trades below the retard radar
Don‚Äôt think so Nebraska and Maine will give each one point which means a tie won‚Äôt work
Biden gonna tell BLM to stand back and stand by
Bloomberg showing PA counted 67% with ü•≠ 57% and üò¥ 41.8%. So for üò¥ to win PA he has to sweep at-least 58% of the remaining 33% vote. Ok its definitely a toss up.
Literally nothing is getting done for the next two years lol
Got MN. Great omen for WI, MI. With those two, he wins.
Legalize hookers
[deleted]
Yeah we will pump on contesting the election too
Ok Neo.
Same. This fucking website outside of my niche interests and WSB is a total shithole. I was definitely Democratic leaning when Bush and Obama were in office. Now I can't stand the constant whining and Trump hate.

Liberals r fuk
Where‚Äôs the latest thread?
[removed]
They started counting at 7pm today, their state law
You really don't understand how this works
Biden is tired he's trying to go to bed üòÇüòÇ
Because it‚Äôs a republican legislature and this is the narrative they wanted to enable. Now he can continue to spin the mail in fraud conspiracy theory

VIX calls for sure
Trump with PA and WI, Biden with MI and MT... 269/269?
PA hasn't counted a single mail in or early ballot yet.
damn they were not kidding when they said we wouldn't know the results tonight i feel like they went thru the first couple mail-ins on the top of the box and then said fuck it i'm going home
Lol
contested election is priced in boyz.

move along
Been wondering this myself.
Definitely a 50/50 PA

No
don't know what's in the mail-in
zero
I aint on that level lmao
Biden is only leading in 3 out of the 13 battleground states.  Those will decide the election.  All other states won by either party were expected to win.
Fuckery is afoot I‚Äôll give you that
No shit Sherlock

They literally won't declare Florida until they find those ballots whether Trump is winning or not
Yes

Oh didn't see that anywhere. Source?
He‚Äôs winning practically everything
Yus
OMG 269 269 is possible
64% counted as of now fam. That‚Äôs 36% left to decide the vote.

Idk fam, looks like Trump is going to win it
Eh, yes and no, there was a lot of hope for states like FL, NC and even Texas which are all pretty much confirmed for Trump now. While Biden still has roads to win they are closing quickly and the ones that are still open are currently super red (which yes was expected)
Prop 19 should pass though. I'm surprised the margin is so low, they did a terrible job of articulating why it's valuable. I think there are a bunch of people who would hate Prop 15 but be ok with Prop 19 if they knew more about it.
Lmao this whole thing might come down to Wisconsin

Hate to say it myself but it looks like Donnie has the win.

Stop spreading the stupid narrative about the missing ballots
I sold two of my positions to prepare for a sell off, the stocks skyrocketed and im sitting here with 23k depreciating and my fomo growing into rage
for the second time tonight
Why's that?

All down for the fucking, just curious what Atlanta is coming in late can do overall.
Trump win heavily priced in. Time to watch regular tv
They wont though, they are a stretegic company and the fact they won the stage 2 contrect for the Vulcan V rocket and the SLS means they are ahead of Northop, SpaceX and BlueOrigin.

Also, they have very long term contrects with the DoD to work on very innovative tech like hypersonic orbital missiles and the replacement for the minuteman II ICBM.
So Trump gonna win and get house and senate?
Soo if Trump wins Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania it‚Äôs over. Biden has to Win all of the blue wall Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania to win.

STAND DOWN BOYZ!!!
I'd say good chance with mail-in fully counted
Prolly not
What bags are you holding?
this is seriously fucking idiotic that we spend trillions of dollars nad have hella unemployed people going homeless and we can't find people to count votes until this shit is done jfc

Stunning and brave
Won‚Äôt matter Wisconsin expects to know by morning and Michigan if the lead is this big it‚Äôs over
Sup Brotendo
Pretty sure harambe had more than that in 16
Market goes up either way, but doubly for Trump
Yes
64% of uncounted votes are in counties that voted for Clinton in 2016. 

1.6 million dem ballots, 580,000 Repub, and 260,000 NPA. 

I‚Äôm just adding this because it‚Äôs silly to think right now that PA is decided.
I wouldn‚Äôt call it delusional. This is a different race than 2016. There are so many mail in ballots not counted yet which heavily lean Biden.
It's 2020, why the hell do we have to wait to count mail in votes still? Send that sheeeet thru email
Any chance joe gets PA?

Biden just needs a combination of PA + any other state (except Alaska), North Carolina most likely. This is the only way for a Biden win. Also, the 300k missing ballots in Florida are a big deal so we won't know who won for a while anyway until they find them
It says 47th ‚Äúvice president?‚Äù Lmfao

Can Trump even win without Arizona?
Actually in the millions and allegedly 3:1 and 2:1 Democrat
PA is 57 T to 42 Bid.. looking like T

Google "election tracker"

See all those red swing states that didn't get called yet? Once they get called, all those electorals go to Trump.
Biden speaks and it's not a concession bit one of those, "we're gonna fight on throughout the evening and tomorrow and until we get the votes counted" and it'll be boring.

Trump then will speak and who fucking knows what he'll say but it's gonna make shit pumpy pump or poopoo dump

Those are fair points points but I still think that trying to predict what will happen in 2028 is crazy rn. 4 years ago the "radical" ideas of the left weren't really so mainstream and 10 years ago these new leftist ideas weren't even on the table. Im lib left but the GOP has a lot going for it. The rural areas control the most basic things that allows any nation to function. Food production, manufacturing, mining, oil and energy. I just don't know if there will be a culture shift somewhere along the line that shifts the nation to work together more. Idk

That‚Äôs clearly bullish right??
If he takes PA, likely he took at least MI or WI as well.

So best case scenario for Biden is he gets 290.

Leading in pure numbers is meaningless without understanding the outstanding districts.

Virginia was called for Biden when trump had like 58%, for example. But the statisticians knew that the rest of the votes were coming from dem areas. 

All that matters is which districts haven't reported yet. And the fact that these states haven't been called means that it's not as obvious as it looks.
Fox News reported Biden won it already. How do you explain that one?

>Also DXY spiked because people know that under Trump there likely won‚Äôt be an adequate stimulus, 

Amazing how quickly you've changed your tune from 10 minutes ago when you were like "hurr durr, China is lowering its currency on purpose.  Duhhhh."  Trump is infinitely better for the market and worse for China in every way.  You are a brainwashed moron if you are hiding from that fact.

Pa looking biden tho the philly turnout is insane and still over 1m ballots to vote. Gotta hope that carries to Madison and MI
Look at the leads
All I wanted was some volatility, not some bs pop
Nothing. Because >75% of the reporting has come from republican dominated districts. If 68% of the remaining votes to be counted are for Biden, then Biden wins PA. That's the margin needed to surpass the current lead. Which is completely plausible since the remaining districts are strongly democratic and the votes are mail-in ballots.  Which if you consider that roughly 70% of mail-in ballots are democratic votes then it becomes easy to see how PA is entirely way to close to call.

Market pumps for Biden market pumps for trump
I like masturbating. But, also money. Yes.
Honestly a smart move on Trumps part. That and getting Kanye to run to steal some democratic votes are some brilliant moves.
every news outlet including Fox News is showing Biden in the lead with remaining states likely to take longer than today to finish counting

So why is everyone here so confident of a Mango win?
Looks like the democrats won't flip the senate. So it would be best that trump wins if we want anything done with McConnell in charge

All this trump and Biden stuff is crazy, but I still ain‚Äôt never seen two pretty best friends
The remaining states that matter the most are looking like Trump wins.
Why is Virginia called blue even though Trump has more votes?

Guys chill I‚Äôm in an airport terminal watching the colorful map
If trump wins Wisconsin and Michigan, it‚Äôs all over
If it looked like that, they would call it.

Numbers are meaningless without understanding the outstanding districts.

Fox called Iowa for Trump

Multiple outlets calling AZ for Biden
Yes. Seriously
They should rename it /antitrump

Leaning Trump, Biden needs a miracle in one of the bigger swing states.

Finally some real discourse
[deleted]
Tea
I see the point the mods make on why we can‚Äôt talk about politics on here. Way too many people are unable to separate logical analysis from emotions/bias. 

Also, the main reason a lot of people here lose money as well ironically.

I sound a bit like a dick there, but if you think this election is 100% going to one candidate or the other as of right now: you belong on r/politics.

All the data I‚Äôm looking at makes it appear Biden is still more likely than not to win the election. A ton of mail in ballots in PA especially, MI, and WI makes those states still very much in the running. With Biden winning AZ, 79-83% chance he has won even with Trump pulling all the other sunbelt states that were toss ups.

We won‚Äôt know until tomorrow at the earliest who won. Most likely Thursday or Friday unfortunately for the market.

Technically yes but not probable. I don‚Äôt know the senate mix but GOP currently have more seats and I think are expected to hold majority. For en bloc purposes the GOP controls both houses and would likely vote together
and in my pants
Very
Valid point. A total crushing victory by either side was probably our best shot. I mean I'm willing to play puts, but I think volatility will reign supreme if we go with a split government on extremely tight voting margins.

Biden has more electoral votes called, but Trump is leading in all the contested states. Assuming he holds that lead, he wins. current estimate is 290 Trump 239 Biden 9 TBD

The deadline was mailing them on election day so... technically there was a deadline
Ohio went to Trump. This gonna be a edge of your seat election
Nobody wins in this election. And I mean that. A 10-20 point electoral college win will do nothing to ease the tensions from both sides

98% of total votes (estimated)
So many fucking morons on here.  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania will determine the election and they have tons of mail in ballots left to be counted

Yep you are correct there. I just wonder because historically Dems and Rs were more willing to work together and compromise to keep shit moving. Many "unwritten" rules have been broken in the last decade and it seems like cooperation between the parties is at a rough spot. I'm worried about it tbh, but we'll see what happens
Votes
When did Arizona get so liberal?
TBF he was an Independent for years so it was not really his party
This is the issue.  You can Google it, there are articles that already explain there are 2 seperate economies, and subsequently, 2 seperate cultures / societies within America.   Dems focus is entirely urban America.  Policies to deal with any issue in urban America doesn't work for suburban.  

Take the batshit crazy, coal is coming back.   Its the only tangible solution anyone has brought to some rust belt areas.  That's all dems have to beat and they can't because they don't care.  I do keep hearing dems want to bring green jobs!!!!!   Okay, but what are they specifically.  Which counties... how much is being invested....   yeah, these aren't real.
The simpsons predicted a trump re-election boys. simpsons are never wrong, spy & qqq calls out the gate tomorrow
It's true. Someone clogged the shitter and they had to close the polling station. That particular county counts for I think something like .10% of the state. Can't remember the real numbers so take that with a grain of salt.
Pretty amazing to watch the GOP turn on a literal Purple Heart recipient and lifelong public servant because he had enough balls not to kiss the ring. ‚ÄúSupport the troops‚Äù my ass.
I was so close to picking up Biden at 3/1 but decided against it as it is way too much of a gamble. What are the implications of their betting line being down?

Well you‚Äôve still got to pick a direction. Unless you think it stays flat. Which is no way.
üòÇ
Did mango man win?
he don‚Äôt get invites
Not convincing. Doesn‚Äôt seem like you have any evidence to back up what you‚Äôre saying. Most likely you just believe what Trump says but don‚Äôt actually look into it any further. American farmers will be destitue in 4 years if Trump wins.
Ya wtf
I live in Georgia. Trust me, Brain kemp will do whatever he can to give Trump the win
Lmao fuck your mail ins just admit you lost
No one knows anymore
Lol no

Edit: retards downvoting can‚Äôt count electoral states apparently
I second this! Both are autist producing news agencies yet as a moderate I can still tolerate can way more than I can tolerate tucker Carlson
Wrong. OH, PA, TX, FL determine and trump is far in the lead in those states. Is over
Mango -180 Sleepy +135 via Bovada.

That's the only indicator I need.
Biden +105
Have you seen anything filed? Come back at me when you have. Still waiting to see all the pollsters explain how bad they were once again calling this Sleepy Joe landslide!
Yo for real she‚Äôs not like other women politicians there‚Äôs something *real*...
No lie tucker and hannity seem kinda weak. Fox might take the L
Gatcha! Thanks
Not high enough. Gimme 2 mins
Dems liked McCain. He was a songbird pos in reality.
Stupid question but my google-fu is lacking, what exactly do those numbers mean?  I get they are odds but I‚Äôve never done sports betting so I have no clue how to interpret that.
Biden wins the election
Dude same. I used to have 85 calls at SP5 expiring in Jan 2022...

Fxxk.
Wisconsin coming in at a percent every 10 minutes hopefully when I wake up it‚Äôs done
lost too much with TLRY to touch it again
CNN, fox 
They‚Äôre all dogshit. We need a new totally unbiased election result channel
we opening super inflated green
Sent from PA? Biden team typing up some mail ins
Only 78% reporting. Trump will win Texas, but it's too early to confirm that. Texas has a lot of people, so 500k isn't a guarantee.
So just pick up calls in the am and forget reading the market?
Fak. This might be true.
NYT just put GA likely Biden
imagine buying NIO puts
If anything that would be a republican move
I'm looking at the AP numbers from Google. So idk what to tell you
**LOL counters in certain states went home for the night and some states machines cant count fast enough. a fast election possibility is FUBAR.**
Whose win is good for my AAPL and AMD calls?
Trump's odds lead went to shit when he lost Arizona

It's basically 50/50 now
PA and GA are pretty pivotal right now
Usually they know what party you align with so if they mail out 1 million democratic and 250k republic you can assume most will come back democratic because you probably don‚Äôt get a ton of switching... it‚Äôs just guessing though until they count them
[deleted]
I was also amazed by that piece of art work.
He‚Äôs not winning at the moment. WI, MI, PA will determine the election
[deleted]
States such as PA already stopped counting tonight, We LITERALLY will not know who won tonight
> But your slutty wife is fair game

JuSt A bLoWjOb
I think he's back to the favourite again now. MN, MI, WI v. unlikely to go trump. NE-2 looks like a lock for Biden. That renders PA meaningless, but Biden still favourite there.
yo Nevada get yo shit together, why haven't they evens started counting over there?
Should have kept my uvxy.

Sorry, had them in my boat under the pile of beer cans
Hard to say how wrong they were right now. Huge amount of mail-in votes left to count in PA, WI, MI
Funny that you think I‚Äôm a dem just because I don‚Äôt have a crazy bias for Trump. I‚Äôm just analyzing the data dude.

Also, mail in ballots weren‚Äôt allowed to be counted until 7am this morning. Pretty easy to see why they might take a couple days for them to be counted.

Those votes still count, just because they decided to mail them in doesn‚Äôt make them illegitimate.
Updated betting odds?
First election eh?
It‚Äôs gonna take a miracle for him to pull a win at this point

‚Äú1 million votes casted were destroyed due to a flood in the counting office. State will be decided by the remaining votes....And Biden wins!‚Äù

Historically, very well for markets.  Dems are keeping the house, though.
carvel promises biden will win
Hunter Biden is available for your service
Ummm does antifa have anti radiation missiles, cruise missiles, or planes?
LOL. James Carvel just told MSNBC viewers to put the razor blades back in the cabinet

MN has always been blue

Mangos attack on mccain was pretty low class tho. He deserves to lose AZ.
Depends on senate flipping or not too
more covid
Trump is winning though..
Pa is very close. Lots of votes in Philly area need counting. Also lots of mailins votes. Can easily sway back to biden. Philly is PAs biggest area and historically very, very blue.
You're saying a Trump-Harris or Biden-Pence WH is possible...lmaooo
Trump but it's 60/40 now not 80/20.
It‚Äôs tight. Seems like Trump rn, but Biden has a small majority (as of like half an hour ago).
I‚Äôm going to check out the last one and hexo
Oh for sure, if he wins you will never hear the end of it.
Lol is that why hes losing the state dam
LOL Georgia count has been suspended for the night after they were unable to find a plumber to fix the burst water pipe at the counting office. They have send all the counters home.
I‚Äôd be fine with that.
My honey jack is almost gone :(
AP already called every barely blue state for Biden and even gave VA for freebie and he‚Äôs only at 209.  Do you dumb libs need a crash course on electoral votes every fucking time?
Options made me look at money different now, $2000 just reads $20.00
In America at least.  They would never be caught dead with the democratic party aka the party of minorities.

Why does tech benefit the most from trump win?

Some places arent counting mail in tonight.
Sorry to jump into what seems like a private conversation. There are many software engineering making 7 figure TC due to the stock market. SNAP software engineers were making 500k TC easily when the stock was $10. So their TC must be in the $1.5-$2.5M range.

If you look online the salary you see posted is just the bare salary. There is usually a yearly bonus, signing bonus (100k+), restricted stock units over three or four years, stock options, random other bonuses during the year, and more! There is a reason why home in the Bay Area can easily cost $4M -$5M around the big tech giants like Facebook.

I also have a net worth of around 5.3 million after this year's taxes, I plan to donate 200k-300k to charity. 2M of it is tied up in Apple stock though (I worked there previously).
Yeh bc it‚Äôs fake

Civil war inc. election is going to be too close and results will be contested
Its about looking at the 2016 map. Based on what Trump took last time, Biden needs to flip 2-3 states. He already got 1 in Arizona. If he gets another, it will be a contested election.
Cnn is trying so hard lmao
Nio puts? You didn‚Äôt do dd my friend.

Sell the news event, mark it
Nah
Why the fuck is it taking so long to count? Are these wankers counting for 5min, scrolling through OnlyFans for 55min and repeating?
Damn market really gonna open without us knowing the next president. CASH gang
He would have been doing a hell of a lot better that‚Äôs for sure.  I voted for Biden, but Bernie was always my first pick.  I think a lot of young guys support him.
God Damn, Jo
Sell because you're a bitch
üíµüñ®
I want to lick the cum out of his dick hole
Should rally for the next few weeks while talks of ballot counting going well
Got us in the first half not gonna lie
Holy f we better be flat at open europoors crashing an asteroid on this party
Yeah but if it‚Äôs enough to bring it within a few tenths, then Biden cod sue for a recount if it came down to it.
The market doesn‚Äôt know who it wants
How he‚Äôs trending in other states.  And it‚Äôs currently more like 223 (Biden) vs 204 (Trump).
When Saban runs for President, he's got my vote.  No shit.
Good, I'm tired to seeing those stupid ass commercials

It was their plan all along to ensure they can steal this election...

+600 to +105 now for Biden. What a flip
Which has been the case since like 2010 lmao
He's a retard for that one comment that could end up being his undoing. Imagine losing the presidency because you replied to "are you going to get rid of the oil industry?" with a "yes."
Explain them to me!! I don't do gambling... outside of wsb
It's not, Sleepy still has a chance. It isn't over yet.
Yeah... i could see that.
Election talks going well
You're trying to get your boy Trump arrested in the WH, aren't you?
AZ to Biden and legalize marijuana? Damn who would‚Äôve guessed
I heard that in Europe: right wins because we were so sure that the left would that people didn‚Äôt go out and vote. It‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs else fault always
Puts on Pennsylvania
DoNt FoRgEt AboUt AlAsKa AnD hAwAiI
It‚Äôs not even worth explaining to you how that‚Äôs not important if you don‚Äôt already know
Are Bulls dead if we get Biden + McConnel led Senate?
Forget Florida, Why is Texas not called even though Trump is leading by 500k votes lol!
She's got the body type and strong jaw where it's not attractive and you both know it, so she over compensates her game is total fire.
He 'complained' about it being called for biden
Every news channels have different number.
so a biden presidency and a republican senate and house, how would that combo play out
I‚Äôm black, the state fucks me enough already.
TX and FL are in denial

People don‚Äôt know shit apparently
Buy 1000 $3 puts.
OH goes to trumpüôÉ
Will tsla tank?
Me too. üëç Don‚Äôt care up or down. Already sold that premium.
CNBC said shit done
because you retard edge lords were running in REEEE'ing all over the place
I'm down ü§ô
That was painful. Yea I have lost 30K in some couple of days and last week was brutal. And as I added puts two days ago we have super bull run for 2 days (and now AH)

God speed.
Massive swing in the betting odds.
Full tilt
Like knowing how to read numbers and understanding values has any importance in a place like this
