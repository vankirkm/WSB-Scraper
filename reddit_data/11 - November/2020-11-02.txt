This sector rotation is in part due to following: month end portfolio rebalancing, higher manufacturing #s (giving hope of a rebound) and few articles calling for return of value stocks all curiosily released right during tech earnings release.

They were killing it a good while, but I haven‚Äôt been impressed with them lately. It might be too early for a gambling stock to explode though.

commodities money shift + supply disruption due to low capex from corps is on its way baby
It took effect immediately but it takes time for the policies to make a difference to a corporation. 

Take the steel tariff for example. The first few months are reactionary, the next few years can be used to open new steel factories and bring workers back online. To get the full measured effect of a tax cut it takes a few years for the corporate entities to adjust their strategies.
I think you are wrong.

Biden wins with a landslide blue sweep, a margin so large that it makes all Trump's efforts completely useless, his twitter becomes impotent and no one pays attention to him any further. Market rallies hard with the expectation of a massive stimulus in Jan with democrats in control of congress and the presidency. Volatility implodes. Relief rally built up from the last 2 weeks gives temporary market reprieve. After that it is all about stimulus hopes vs virus/lockdown progression.

Long $825,000 of SPY at the close.
You ain‚Äôt lying. 2020 sucks
Did anyone else go balls deep in cannacalls incase Biden wins
Pups before hoes...or take him with you and leave him in another room

Well the CDC recommended the no sail order be delayed until Feb 2021 (I believe). Trump Administration said heck no they can sail after Halloween it's safe. Cruise lines decided on their own to not sail, cause shit is not safe. When an industry desperate for money gets the green light to resume operations and decides it's not a good idea, that should really say something.

Thats funny bc I thought about running straddles on both so either way one leg should pay out. (SPY 1dte calls/puts & FSLR calls/puts). That way every scenario should have one payout.

but if you arent gonna do that, then read this

https://web.archive.org/web/20191003170655/https://www.reuniting.info/science/sex_in_the_brain

>UPDATE (2014): Researchers have shown that ejaculation, even twice a week, shrinks the dopamine-producing neurons in the VTA, which reduces a male's response to the pleasure of morphine. This also happens with repeated heroin use in both rats and humans. Scientists have also learned that amphetamine activates the exact same nerve cells as orgasm, urging the brain to "remember and repeat." In other words, drugs of abuse "work" because they're hijacking the mechanisms that evolved to make us want sex...and yet experience aftereffects from too frequent sex.

I don‚Äôt think that has anything to do with politics per se. The biggest difference between a successful trader and non-successful one is emotional bias. Leave that shit at the door when you trade. The only difference is WSB is still pretty inexperienced and this election is polarizing and emotions are running high.

I bought a couple rugs from other the other day, and was a bit worried about the return of them. I'm getting a new house in a few weeks and worried which one would go with the furniture that was coming... They said that as long as it was damaged on in a sellable state and not out of season, they would really take it back. They said that doesn't work so well for TVs and what not which can get replaced quickly with newer technology and not easily resellable. No real point to this comment except returns do seem to be based off of how easy they can repackage it and sell it.

Do you not believe that elderly people, immune compromised people could lock themselves in their homes and get healthy person like yourselves to deliver groceries and supplies? We can't shut down the country because we would have no supplies to give then if no one produced them. 

This idea that we can lock down a global economy is ignorant and would destroy healthy families. For every 1% increase in unemployment 40,000 people die what about them? Are you saying their lives don't matter?

It's so retarded it just might work. I'll buy a few contracts tomorrow. I've lost money on worse plays.

Pypl pulled them down. All tech earnings have beaten and all stocks have gotten a beating. I'm closing my January SQ call before er.
There has to be a ticker which does well in volatile times, and would do well with a victory from either side. I just have no idea what it is. WMT?

nothing exciting about my positions. the jump back in June was travel (cruises mostly) and oil that i got in near the bottom. then made shit decisions and lost most of it.

second wave is mostly from NIO. bought calls at $5 and more around $19 for an average of $12.55. selling everything when it hits $40

These dates are correct. Technically your options expire the day after the listed expiry day. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to trade them on the day listed since they would be.... expired.

Personally I really want to get back in to CHWY. It's not contingent on election day afaik, but it has dipped quite a bit the last week or so, far below where I would expect it to stabilize in the long run. Right now it's about $62 and I think the stable price will be around $70.

L.o.l. Let‚Äôs be honest between u and me. We never had a real lockdown. Possibly like 1-3 weeks? That‚Äôs not a lockdown. And since that point we have been talking about social distancing and wearing masks. But people refuse to do so. I see it everyday, either blow the chin or below the nose or not at all. So how do u solve a problem where the population refuses to have some decency ( like South Korea or New Zealand or Australia) and wear masks ? Do we just sacrifice the elderly, the ones with immune compromised bodies bec they were born with a disease? Or some work accident caused them to lose their colon ( which is a huge part of ur immune system) what do u say to those ppl? Can‚Äôt close the economy for u buddy? I thought this was America where everyone had a fair chance. Btw I‚Äôm (thankfully) fully healthy so even if I get COVID it won‚Äôt be that bad but just bec it won‚Äôt effect me doesn‚Äôt mean other ppl don‚Äôt matter. Anyway you prob already voted for mr.supreme leader so let‚Äôs just pray that he loses and our economy isn‚Äôt fucked for the next 2 years just so we won‚Äôt take a 2 month lockdown....

Btw in that time a lot of small business will close bec stimulus won‚Äôt pass bec of fuckall republicans, but ya brother let‚Äôs just pump all the money and give all the business to big companies like Amazon to just dictate our lives :)

805 with a four roses chaser
I have an Ipad that I use only for watching porn, an Iphone 7 and a LG g6 that I don't use, a Lenovo Thinkpad, a macbook from 2013 covered with dust. I can't believe I spent all these money.

After discovering wsb in this April so far I bought a Bluetooth headphone for $12 from amazon and that's it. I realized that I have been paying prime membership fee for nothing so I canceled it today.

wsb made me financially responsible to not spend money on unnecessary stuff that I don't need.

I made $1066 today scalping SPY calls and puts so I bought 4k more puts for 4th. I am responsible now, financially.
What measures exactly
I really do not see Big T losing Florida

Bitch I already sold today, need to reload.

They are already up 50% since March lows so they are not high on my recovery list but yeah, them too!
I live in California.  Me and five others voted for Trump.
Yea we get it. It‚Äôs like 2nd grade math. Nobody cares.
Let‚Äôs be real here.  If Donny pulls it off, does his heart really have another 4 years left in it? And does Biden‚Äôs brain, for that matter?
Well he bought them months ago when GameStop‚Äôs stock price was very low. He held on and as the stock price rose so did the contract prices.
Things have been insanely dicey. It can‚Äôt get much dicier.
Hey shithead, Google "Glock price over time" and you will see that its physically impossible to buy one right now, and parts for them cost 5x what they normally do. I'm a gunsmith on the side and I'm here to tell you the time to invest in this was March, because manufacturers have been sold out since coronavirus rumors. Everyone bought their guns a long time ago, and not to mention, at this point in time, there is no consumer base for guns. Most ammunition is bought by law enforcement before it even reaches retail shelves, and guns are scarce and expensive. No reasonable person has purchased a firearm in the last 6 months, considering you either get scalped on the purchase, or you can not find one for a reasonable price.

The Supreme Court being stocked will provide some stability though. We may see it stumble, however we know that the court will prevent chaos. 

Trump staying in office, we will see fluctuations but then trend up. 

Biden wins, we can expect it to tank to pre trump era numbers.  They will call it a ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù or the true recession as it is realized from Trumps economy but it will be rough regardless.

The reason it is going down is it's still in a spending phase. It still has to spend tons of money on lobby efforts even after sports have come back. It's still a great long term hold - but it rose too fast. After it finishes the lobby efforts it's going to be growth.

Because it's horseshit, because it implies that the left are a bunch of animals who will riot because they lost an election, which has literally never happened before, ever.

I'm not saying you are like a Russian bot or anything, but you are inadvertently repeating their nonsense.


The fear of protests is about Trump's promise to not accept any results after election night. Not him winning fairly.

And honestly if the president tries to nullify votes, then that's a good fucking excuse to riot. I'll riot. That's our democracy, bro.

If he wins fairly? He wins. No one will riot over that.

Poll science is very flawed and is very bad at giving an outcome because of sample sizes and reliance on yes+ or no+ answers. Also you don't have to be good at math for casino gambling. Basic strategy is not hard to follow and easily googleable for Blackjack, for example. Not saying I'm betting on either side but the outcome is kind of up in the air, due to the seven or so swing states.

I actually really like this company. They have experience and technology having brought the Fisker Karma to market, and you would assume management was able to learn from the mistakes that caused the first company to go bankrupt. 

The Fisker Ocean is an affordable vehicle with a minimum range of 250 miles that meets the needs of the growing CUV/SUV market. It is priced perfectly at the 37,499 mark, making the real price of the car an attractive 29,999 after the federal tax credit. That is a huge mental barrier. If Fisker can produce a profitable electric vehicle at that price, they won't have enough supply to meet demand.

Finally Fisker has partnered with Magna, a massive tier 1 automotive supplier that has experience building electric vehicles.

This company is much more than vaporware. Rivian, Nio, and Fisker are the three electric vehicle companies that I believe can sell competitive electric vehicles at a profit.
Yes
Damn real shame
Lmao polls in 2016 didn't say a 100% winner. They give odds. Or are you too retarded to know that a 10-20% chance is still a real chance?
It‚Äôs not real, best not stick around long enough and find out.

Few more weeks of working at Wendys and you'll be back.

Maybe practice discipline with selling at reasonable gains. Has saved me a ton of grief. Sure, some shit will keep mooning, but more often than not, it will tank while other people lock in profits before you. 

Started taking profits on more volatile positions around 30-50%. If I truly believe in the company and think they will keep pushing harder, I usually hold that shit unless I want to take some profits to hedge.

Trust me man I have lost a shit ton of money, almost 12X what you have lost. I am fortunate enough to still be fine, and in the process have learned to be more disciplined. 

Good luck to you

Uneducated people will believe anything if it‚Äôs easy to comprehend, even if the actual issue is substantially more complex.

Conspiracy theory: We are being inversed to manipulate the market: if you want to manipulate the market into being green, why would you pump money into the most expensive thing that everyone else expects the money to go to? You can make much more impact by lifting the $10 stocks to $11, instead of lifting a $110 stock to $111. Plus, you have all of us helping to hold tech steady, because we only think short term. This is especially true, if institutional traders know that one day, the travel stocks will go up, and they want to diversify out of the big tech potential bubble. With that being true, why not take advantage of the extra benefit of boosting stocks now, which helps burn retail puts.

not true.

in 2008 DST was extended by a full month. those extra 4 weeks save about 1.3 trillion watt hours.

we definitely still save energy because of DST. 

however.. the issues comes down to which areas. because some states will save money and its possible others will waste more. due to heating and cooling aspects. but overall countrywide studies have shown a savings. a study in indiana saw a rise, california saw no difference, but some places like Michigan where heating in winter months but the extra hour of daylight comes in handy to keep the lights off for longer. its all relative and we should probably have region specific timezones rather than the time zones we have created by railroads lol

There's a lot of missing demographics in polls. It's not intentional, but if you look at many of the national polls their n is like 1000 or so. Sample distribution looks good but many factions that will vote will not answer a polling call, and most of that group supports Trump according to 2016 data.

Not bad advice, recently this market feels like a game of poker where you're always trying to read one level deeper vs. your opponent...never know when the back and forth will end.

[ATHX](http://www.reddit.com/r/ATHX) will be my savior next year and the fact that it's NEVER talked about here just reinforces my conviction. Highly recommend checking them out.

I get what you‚Äôre saying but the risk is still high. All of the companies you listed are at risk of bankruptcy before business returns to normal.

The recovery isn‚Äôt going to be as smooth as you‚Äôre making it out to be.

No changes to my function, but an average of 2 bottles of beer 5 nights a week has become 4 beer almost every night, and often a double gin & tonic.

It was a terrorist plot born from frustration with lockdowns. That is a non-partisan issue. 

I personally do not know a single person that thinks Whitmer stayed within reason in MI. Not saying she should be kidnapped, but she did act like a total bitch
That‚Äôs what they want you to think so you‚Äôre not watching the drop on Tuesday when everybody‚Äôs at the polls
You ever about to go down on a girl and her pussy smell like some sardines so you kiss her hip and go back up while telling her to close her eyes so you can do that sexy thing just to hold your breath and pray to god your mom texts you to come home early?
To some people here that would be a win
Tech red by morning
You may be right, but one thing I know about this market is you can have the most obvious answer in front of you, everything adds up to one answer, direction is a for certain, and this fucking market will do the exact opposite. Careful out there, a lot of people are predicting a sell off and positioning themselves for it, but it might just inverse the masses and it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time, nor the last. üí™

Someone once told me they got out of the cycle of losses when they started trading only Leaps.

Like fam, leaps got me stuck in the cycle of losses and gains back in 2018. Long expiry ain‚Äôt no guarantee for gains. Sometimes it just means you lose more slowly.
Ungh, I love it when T&A supports my positions.

Enjoy your "fpbp" responses, because that's literally all you have in your miserable fucking life. Fuck you, seriously.

Maybe not an all out civil war but I can see things escalating well beyond what we saw in June/July in many cities. Mostly small skirmishes between left wing activists/communists/anarchists and right wing militias back by police and other people claiming to defend property. 

We saw a glimpse with Rittenhouse in WI and the Alt-right guy getting shot in Oregon. It will only taken a few more of those before all the fireworks, pepper spray, baseball bats, and paintball guns are replaced by worse things. Even if .5% of the country is drawn into participating, it could present a significant disruption to the country.

Our lead you down the path of a weird kink you really don‚Äôt want
Not really worried about anything other than covid and a lack of ability to control a significant spread. I'm bearish now because we don't have a plan and won't (because the only plan is to not to do shit) and at this rate it's only a matter of when we are forced to lockdown if hospitals get taxed too hard. 

I've never seen anything like the lines I'm seeing in Chicago for testing now, at the beginning of all this shit storm fuckery, it wasn't even close. That alone has people afraid. 

(But, I don't know shit. Just one man's opinion from his little bubble, on pebble, drifting along a black abyss.)

Well yeah, but that‚Äôs much more relevant for buy and hold long term investing. If you‚Äôre trading like we all are, I just find a lot more success trading the price action I‚Äôm given each day as opposed to guessing what I think it will be the day before and getting wiped with an opposing gap.

Wake up. Crying, crying, crying! Try too think of a reason to live, much less get outta bed and face another day of red dicks. Look at my account page, scream shit, shit, shit! Go to the bathroom quickly and throw up. Then realized I shouldn't have thrown up because that was the last if the ramen I had. Think about SPY puts then remember I don't have any money! 

Go behind Wendy's dumpster and give enough $5 BJ's to have breakfast and get more ramen. Remember to use the last of my tube of chapstick to save wear and tear on my already worn out, swollen lips. Keep trying to remember that semen is full of Protein So I probably should swallow it. 

Then think I should buy calls on the company that makes chapstick since I go through so much of it behind the dumpster. Then suddenly remember I don't have any money üí∞. Proceed to quick stop crying to buy ramen and more chapstick.

I never said to not take social distancing precautions. I said we can't shut down the country like Biden and Harris has suggested. I understand we need to curb the spread, so we need to reduce the amount of contact we have with one another. 

Decimating the economy and killing jobs is not what I want in my presidency. 

Like I mentioned before we have to learn to deal with the virus, and not lock down the country.

A lot of people think it will be bad. That violence will occur if the election is contested. My baseless theory is this: its extraordinarily slim the violence is worse than what we have seen over the past 5 months. Even if there is peak unrest, how does that impact stonks? This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish. Don't let the media get your worked up into thinking this is the end times. It's not.

I've been in 100 shares at $24 when I thought that was the bottom-ish after being up quite a bit above there.

Hypothesis is built on a dangerous assumption: That Trump's supporters care at all about any analysis of his chances of reelection, be out on PredictIt or any other medium.

The number of comments, posts, and online wagers shared here by people who are absolutely convinced that Trump will win pales in comparison to what people who are deeply entrenched in MAGAism and MAGA echo chambers believe.

People like me, who think Biden is the odds on favorite, have sold off the vast majority of their equities last week. Retail investors who are holding now are either convinced that Trump is going to win, or that it won't matter.

So, if the news breaks that Trump, in fact, has lost, this could be going south and very quickly, as a drop would be a self-fulfilling prophecy for MAGAers, and people convinced the market won't drop suddenly begin to find out that they're wrong.

EBAY 44.5p, 11/6

UBER 32p, 11/6

In media interviews with supporters, it's a common theme that Trump can't lose unless by cheating, and if he does there'll be trouble. And we know there is a militia problem. Not saying they will definitely be brave enough but they are definitely talking about it so it's possible.

In 2008, the day after Obama won the election we dumped -6% but the market performed very well in the long term. We might still dump on Wednesday but long term trajectory is still upwards.

Yeah you're probably good to grab pizza for dinner or a little later and watch coverage.  The west coast won't be done voting until like midnight EST.  Alaska and Hawaii don't really matter.

A lot of the swing states are in the Midwest so they close an hour behind.  Obviously most of the results won't be finalized until a lot later but usually things stay pretty much in proportion to what the early results are showing.

If any of those states are called for Biden it won't matter, he will just be ignored like he usually is.
Do people not realize that businesses are boarding up in preparation for  a Trump win. If Trump wins literally every major city will explode with riots. If Trump loses I doubt there will be any riots. Stop being so delusional. The right doesn't loot and riot like the left does and this is coming from a Biden supporter.

I live in DC and can confirm it‚Äôs like a war zone before the battle. 

Went into my office today (it was a ghost town) and every building from the Capitol, to Georgetown, to downtown is boarded up. Roads are closed. Barricades are up. Helicopters are flying over neighborhoods at low altitude. 

It‚Äôs fucking nuts bro. 

For proof here‚Äôs a photo from the front of an office near the Capitol. Every place in DC looks like this.

Lockdowns and giving people money make it so the hospitals don‚Äôt get overrun bro, like how they are currently. Have u read about el paso,Texas? They have people dying in the hallways bec they don‚Äôt have enough space.

Also if your great supreme fuckhead leader is correct and a ‚Äúsafe vaccine‚Äù is coming thru soon don‚Äôt u think it would be a good idea to wait these 1-2 months at home and then give everyone the vaccine? Saving lives and not destroying hospitals ?

yeah im debating whether i want to yolo on it or not. I'm thinking an at the money weekly might be worth the gamble right before earnings if spy holds 320 and qqq bounces after election

i think a 2021 call would definitely end up printing at some point. qcom has eliminated most of their bear cases like the lawsuit in the past year. Think it's going to keep getting multiple expansion like during dot com. It's a retirement stock + high yield so safe and cheaper than AMD/NVIDIA. Also QCOM held 50 day in sept-oct and AMD/NVIDIA didn't

No one is going to riot or loot because their party didn't win.

The only reason there are even talks about riots is because Trump keeps fucking saying that he will reject any votes counted after election night, or any call made after election night, which is ridiculous.


It's pretty simple: 

democracy = no riots

stomping on democracy = riots

well if you take a ceiling breaking stock like amazon, it rose to 1700 and consolidated for close to 2 years. but I think we are kind of in this feedback loop of leverage where things continue to intensify and move faster as we go deeper into this bull run. if you zoom out to max on Amazon's total chart, what took years might now only take months. so i could see it initiating another big leg up at any moment

if you want to wait for the trend to demonstrate itself, thats probably sane. i took the insane choice of hoarding calls in a low IV environment. might not see a low IV again when it matters TBH
Because the market is finally pricing things with earnings/guidance rather than continue to bubble corona/home economy hype.  Big money taking risk off the table.

Totally agree that it‚Äôs not a $2000 gun, especially the victor model - I bought my saint edge for slightly over $1k before all this demand started and it‚Äôs one of my favorite assembled guns out of the box. If you look at what‚Äôs actually regularly in stock online though as far as the saint edge model goes though they are selling for over $2000, victors are going for about $1500 - presumably to people who are panic buying. Have been random normal priced ones that pop up but they obviously get snapped up pretty quick. This is the only place I‚Äôve found in the last week with one actually in stock and it‚Äôs $2699 (which no one in their right mind should pay) https://gunprime.com/products/spr-ste955556b.

You make too much sense.  Therefore I feel better about my position on UVXY...;)

  I have shares though so I can wait for the next drama event whatever that is.   UVXY shot up from 15 bucks all the way to 110 Dollars in the last covid event.   It went nuts.   Honestly,  I think shit gonna hit the fan.   Trump is incredibly smart when it comes to pushing through and being tough guy.  Look how far he got.  He is a reality tv star with a failed real estate career who made it as the goddam president of the most powerful country in the world.   He has been given carte blanche by his cult and he can do whatever the fukk he wants.  He literally said he grabs women by the Pu\*%$ and as he stated "He can go on 5th avenue,  shoot someone and he wont lost any voters.   I think its going to be a very close election.  If he loses,  he is not going to let biden have it.   If he wins,   he is going to be unleashed and do whatever he wants.   He held back a bit last year as he understood he has been tanking the markets.     Power with a win is going to go all out

Oh believe me, when the recovery starts, I will go tits deep into calls.

Maybe, depends if they get the senate too. Without, they're still stuck on the lower stim amount, but also looking at tax hikes at the same time.  


If they keep the senate, the Rs will simply revert back to being very concerned about the defecit and refuse to go higher on stim than they are now or possibly go even lower to their original. Or they give in to cut their losses. We'll find out soon I suppose!

I think I understand your question. Rolling is just closing out a position and reopening it for a later date. You also might get more premium or less depending on how you play the strike price. 

That‚Äôs the general concept but on TOS you can actually click roll which will execute the two moves in one for you. If you roll for a credit you don‚Äôt need any buying power which is a huge advantage if you are over leveraged

Most of us had puts over weekend. What do you expect.
Nah dude, I bought puts this morning then sold them in the afternoon for legal tender.

Now, the puts that I still have? Yeah, they might be fucked. But their current value is only a fraction of the bear gainz made in October.

When you're a bear, you will always get fucked in the end. The trick is to have mostly cash in the end.

You can't survive in the cave if you're all-in on puts at any given time.

But, you know, maybe they aren't fucked. Then I get even more legal tender.

Theta is your biggest enemy. Holding to expiry means you‚Äôre guaranteeing the largest possible loss to theta. Better to sell at a predetermined P/L like +/- 25%, adjusted per your confidence in the play. Could be day 1 or 90, if you‚Äôre up 25%, sell. No emotions.

I‚Äôm a gun owner who experienced the Obama era ammunition shortages and worked in the industry on the retail side (ironically I also lived close to Ferguson) - a lot of that Ammo shortage was initially driven by an increase in gun purchases during his first term which in turn caused more ammo to be sold (as I recall it was mainly .22 and it kind of cascaded from there). The really big shortage happened right after sandy hook because people thought Congress was going to pass stricter gun or ammunition control laws which resulted in panic buying. Suddenly every new gun owner thought that 5,000 rounds of .22lr was going to protect them against the federal government so they‚Äôd bring in their whole families and they‚Äôd each buy a crate since we had a one package per person policy. People would find out when our shipments were coming in and start forming lines at 5am. Was really something.

Ivol backwardation curve is too steep. MMs will have to buyback delta with any significant downward move. This is why market mechanics doesn't allow a crash that people see coming. Also why puts have been overpriced/not worth it since last week. But good luck, I hope you make that $.

If you have a completely rudimentary Wall Street bets level understanding of Economics then yeah you worry about who wins.

It does matter. I‚Äôm explaining the fact that there IS a NEAR CONSTANT downward force in UVXY. If status quo stays the same UVXY goes down. So it‚Äôs an uphill battle to bet that it will go up 33% in the next 2 weeks and stay there. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm trying to explain, not trying to sound smart. UVXY has lost 99.99% of its value since its inception in 2009. If you don‚Äôt understand why this is happening you are prob one of the people Reee-ing about how UVXY is manipulated and confused when it doesn‚Äôt perfectly inverse SPY and you should not be trading UVXY.

Based on options pricing, the expected movement in SPY on Wednesday is $11 which is 3.3%. I bet we'll easily get a 5-6% movement though.

You want to keep OTM premium as low as possible in this case. You know what I mean on that right? Spy is $330, if you paid $35 for a $300 call then it's $30 itm and $5 otm. OTM premium will be a higher percentage the further out you go because of theta and IV. I don't trade SPY much so I can't really recommend an optimal strike or date. Best advice, ask on r/thetagang. They know a lot about buying inexpensive leaps to sell premiums against.
Probably? There's mixed senate fuckery too, Biden presidency and red senate is terrible for stimmy.

I'm just gonna trade the outcome regardless, no point making a bet leading into it.

I'd definitely like to trade according to actual fundamentals and not macro events for once tho

Corsair products are putting up crazy review numbers on amazon.

LL120s have 9600 reviews on amazon, that number was 7000 a couple of months ago.

Corsair came out with an ecosystem over the last few years that actually gives you a benefit from buying all products from their RGB family.

Those fans have proprietary connectors that will only work with a corsair RGB hub. People don‚Äôt give a shit what they have to pay.

It looks the best.

Reflecting back on this past year, I would say all my positions and entries were good. The problem is I didn't know when to exit. Both missing out on gains and having gains turn to losses.

.. pulled a little of mine. Conditions I read were Have you been impacted by Covid? Loss of hours, life, bazillion other ways. Told the financial dude at NetBenefits that it hasn't actually reduced my wages. I just can't sign up for more than 20 hours of overtime a week anym... "stop right there. It impacted your hours, your good.". > Me. "Well it hasn't actually decreased m... " "Its ok sir. You don't have to explain. Covid has taken your hours away." So just to warn you it can take up to 3 days before you see the money in your account." Painstakingly easy.  Was shocked that I didn't need proof and the dude kept cutting me off when I was trying to explain that it didn't actually affect me. Also another clause is using it for a car or home loan. Or to assist with such payments.

That is also what I‚Äôm saying. You take your captain gains minus your capital losses and pay tax on the remaining gain, if any. If however you end up with a remaining loss, you can deduct that loss up to 3k. Any amount over that is carried forward. This is only true if it‚Äôs capital gains (which means securities sold after being held for over a year). Netting LTCG, STCG, LTCL, and STCL is a bit more complicated.

Weeks later RGR goes to $6 and SWBI goes to $56 then $40

Nov 6 1996 Bill Clinton is re-elected 
Current price of RGR is $17 weeks later it‚Äôs $15.40

Nov 3 1992 Bill Clinton wins presidency 
Current Price of RGR is $9.40 weeks later it‚Äôs $8.50

Yes those are their lows and in the long run they all rose but why would you want to risk bag holding for this period of time?

Not even they apparently are going to meet the next earning report too. So we will have to wait atleast another whole quarter to see if they tank. Meaning the price will probably go up another $20. Especially if we get another little stim

Hey genius you know how they calculate these statistics: they take a states budget and see how much of it is made up of federal dollars. That calculation is skewed nimrod. For one, red states budgets are smaller than bloated blue state budgets that are usually in a deficit like California. Secondly, Medicare, Medicaid and ssi are allocated in those federal dollars u numb skull. Americans pay into those programs so it‚Äôs not welfare. And if the federal aid is welfare, 9 out of 10 it‚Äôs a democrat voter getting welfare in a red state. Don‚Äôt come at me with bullshit from NPR lib. Try again.

Tomorrow and the remainder of the week will likely be calm. The big market movers are the policies that are enacted - but they take a longer time to be realized.

It took 2-3 years for the corporate tax cut to work its way through the markets. That‚Äôs why we had a strong market the past 3 years, sans the Rona. It will similarly take 2-3 years after passage for the full effects of a future tax change to work through the system.

I love it when every idiot be like ‚Äúbut they beat earnings!‚Äù.

Did you ever wonder how the red fucking candles just drop? Do you think it‚Äôs humans placing these orders?

No, my dear retard, they are not. They are algorithms, and algorithms know what they are looking for. If earnings feel amazing to you, and algos *still* defermine it‚Äôs sell-time, can you imagine just how much more of absolutely insane growth was already priced in? I know you can‚Äôt, because you‚Äôre an idiot, but I‚Äôm saying it anyway. 

Also, god knows what other circumstances algos consider when they‚Äôre selling? Connections you couldn‚Äôt even comprehend in that tiny brain. 

Bottom line - don‚Äôt try to make sense of the earnings, unless you‚Äôre deeply familiar with the valuation and expectations and have a shit-ton of context. Algos are gonna just rip you apart.

Oil stocks. They also performed but not on the same level as Biden stocks like renewables/cannabis since news is mostly showing Biden leading RN. Id say you could hedge your self by splitting your money both ways. But based on the rally I can see cannabis being green and you making more on that at least if we are talking one day swing.

It could work. My brain is still trying to wrap itself around this whole thing. The popularization of the stock market into the hands of your average person is going to have an enormous effect on how things play out and function.

A part of me wants to raise the bar to entry, even if it‚Äôs something simple like getting a 1 to 1 sponsor for a year or something ....

Undue risk to hold shares through potentially contested election. Pump today was to lure more bulls, but sell off tomorrow is to keep entry points low when we get a definitive answer. I base this on absolutely nothing other than not wanting to be completely fucked.

Yep. If trump wins it‚Äôs a skinny 500b stim, when Biden wins trump won‚Äôt do shit for the rest of the year but in Jan we‚Äôll have huge 3T stimmy 

Basically buy calls on everything for April of next year. Unless the Big Dipper hits and we‚Äôre fucked anyways.

You're right if it was a normal election. With expected protests, riots, and court appeals, we're in a bear market. I'm planning on adding more puts tmrw but let's see. Gl
Last time we had a contested election was in 2000

We dropped 7% after election night the rest of the week, but tough to compare to this time because that was during the tech sell off
It's bull.

There‚Äôs no way any of those newly turned bears would hold puts past last Friday when election uncertainty and COVID resurgence was pricing in over the course of 2-3 weeks

...right?
bears in absolute brambles right now
Your math is wrong.

1. You bought the contract for $6.80.
2. Current value is $22.10
3. $22.1 - 6.80 = $15.3

Total return is $15.3. P/L is 15.3. Why are you subtracting the premium again? There is no need. You take this as absolute & total profit.

Current TAN cost is $69.70. If you want to buy TAN with profit from Scenario 1:

1. $69.70 is current underlying price
2. You sell the contract at 22.1
3. 69.7 - 22.1 = 47.6

$47.6 per share price is how much if you were to sell the contract and use extra money to buy 100 shares of TAN. $47.6 is how much you would have to pay per share.


Scenario 2 - Exercising the contract

1. Current contract value $22.10 goes bye-bye. 
2. You get to buy 100 shares of TAN at $50.
3. You have to fork over $5,000

You can see how it's better to simply sell the contract and use the money to buy the underlying? You can do the math yourself and verify via excel.
Thanks for sharing, keep coming back.

Yuan volatilty off the charts, is it really just the US election?

"The country has recently experienced numerous incursions by Chinese warplanes, totaling 29 incidents since Sept. 16, with most of those occurring over the Taiwan Strait southwest of Taiwan‚Äôs main island, including three on Friday (Oct. 30)."

You don't have to big dawg, who is good or bad to you/me is irrelevant. Long as there's someone good to you that guy will be bad to someone else. If it makes you feel better whoever is good to you has probably received donations from the same person/company/pac that gave money to the one you think is bad. Basically it's the illusion of choice, since the 1800s when Carnegie, Rockefeller, JP Morgan came into their fortunes, there was a dynamic move in the power structure of America. No longer did/do the people in office hold power but he people to control the wealth. Nowadays you can also add the people who control the Data to the mix. :)

Sir this is a Wendy's
what‚Äôs he gonna do, burn the white house?
you are going to want to sell the $240 puts right away.  I mean this in all seriousness, put a sell order in right now for $0.03 for all 10 $240 puts.  wake up at open and it it hasn't sold then change the order to 0.02 and if it hasn't sold in 2 minutes sell for 0.01.  There is literally no chance they print. 

the $320 puts are also fairly worthless, you are paying a heavy premium and it will lose value fast.  i would probably also sell those on the first dip of the day.  go Google "spy support and resistance" and look at the levels on barchart for support 1 and 2 and try to sell once it hits the first level.

I don't know anything about betting the volitility plays, but from what I assume they're only worth playing as a hedge when you make large call volumes, and since the market just did a rapid upsy downsy last week chances are those are also not going to move a whole lot. 

the biggest problem with your puts is that on Friday the market closed above $323.5 which was the support level, if it had broke that it would have been a double top indicator for a downtrend for spy... but it didn't and now it's closed at $331. 

I have lots of experience in losing money since March.  $10k-15k-6k-28k-1k-22k-1.8k.  if you want to actually make any money I would recommend clearing all those tomorrow and entering into a few Longer dated options.  you could grab rkt $19 $20 calls that expire December 18th for abo $1.5-$2 an option.  they are high volitility which you know nothing about, but as long as they go up 10% at some point in the next 2 months, then the worst case scenario is you get your money back. 

if you have anymore questions just go ask the mods to ban you for being a gay retard

You can't back test something that is completely dependent on the individual trader's buy/sell timing.   The idea that prior price action plays absolutely 0 role in determining future price action is objectively stupid.  The price with which the bulk of the shareholder base is holding their shares absolutely matters.  TA is not magic, it's not voodoo, it's not bull shit.  It's not the say all be all of trading, but it's a tool like any other.  It's literally just price data visualized onto a chart. You are an idiot

RKT is a good stock, but timing weekly calls is risky.. just get something way out 2021 and you're laughing
Yessir, unless it's the priced in result. In this case, a clean Biden win.

While I think VXX puts are directionally the right way to go make sure not to buy weeklies or you‚Äôll feel a bit of IV crush if it plays out big in your direction.

I opted for call credit spreads since those are still directionally hoping for VXX to go down and they benefit from IV crush.

I feel like Wed is gonna pick a direction and go, tomorrow feels like the indecision day IMO.
Bought a put to hedge against market dropping, bought a call for it mooning, bought a strangle incase it stays flat. Covered all my bases.

Bet your ass market is going to go left just to fuck me now.
Logically speaking, considering how people from the cities have moved to rural areas and red states due to covid, and that we‚Äôre seeing record number of voters, Biden should take this pretty easily. Thoughts?

Price action suggests Trump contesting a loss is priced in now.

The wild swing probably isn't happening - 2% at best.

BLM supporters tear shit up, MAGA supporters don't come across like they're about that life.

They'll protest in pockets but no matter how much Trump tries to incite them they would never burn shit down and cause a convincing amount of unrest/uncertainty.

This week will probably end anticlimactically flat if Biden wins.

Be responsible.
who here got us all kicked off Fidelity's broker?  someone here fucked us all over and now you can't buy FDs on Fidelity anymore unless u got 1milli account.
I bought shares and sold covered calls around the $18 range. I‚Äôve been wrecked since the option premium didn‚Äôt cover the price drop. Then I decided to double down by selling some puts and the price kept dropping. Today was a welcome adjustment, but I fully expect it to tank 10% after earnings are released.

Fuck domino's. Delivery never came

Just inverse the sub when we get to bullish bro
why would they be?
WHAT???
The fact that people believe we will have another crash like the March lows is crazy, and shows there are a lot of new "traders" in here ( less than a year involved in the markets) Crashes comes when there is uncertainty, Covid was a black swan event that came out of nowhere, but now that we already know about Covid and working towards a vaccine, that beast has been tamed.
I found waldo in the background, this is totally fukin bearish
My puts are based on the unexpected shutdown, not election
Pull up the 5 year VVIX chart and you can see how quickly VIX volatility comes down. Hope this guy sells within 24 hours because this bet could go to 0 in a heartbeat come Wednesday

Sir,
You have taken too much ACID
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm hoping yours is golden, but I got my last December and spent the last 2 months trying to get them to fix it, replace it, or give me a refund.  There is a very large fb group dedicated to trying to recall Samsung refrigerators.  They generally have 2 issues - 


1.) If the ice maker is in the refrigerator (not the freezer) then it condensates and either freezes the fan, stops making ice, and/or dispels water under the fridge drawer.  It can also freeze & burst the line- causing flooding.  



2.) It just stops cooling (that‚Äôs what mine did).  It says it‚Äôs at temp, but my melted ice cream and multiple thermometers said it was at 64¬∞. Food above 42¬∞ is particularly unhealthy and many have gotten sick from them üòï

But, a few do fine.  So seriously, good luck

I admire your assumptions, you‚Äôre absolutely correct on the fact that we don‚Äôt know if they were hedges or not. Regardless, a 2 to 1 ratio is a data point to take into account. I never said anything about exclusively using this data point to make trading decisions, I was merely pointing out an oddity.

Cramer pumped this evening.
I think the chances of mango boy winning are better than the chances of a blow out for Biden.  That said, I'll gladly donate the little I have not in cash for a Biden blowout.  Got a 1K bet on Biden to win as a hedge.
And oil will tank anyway just because that‚Äôs what it does
Yeah. Narrated by Vlade Divac (NBA star)
An improving economy is actually quite bad for stock prices because it is completely pumped by stimulus hopes and debt, both which would get crushed by a rising dollar.

Will do! It‚Äôs survived a year with 0 issues but this post informed me of so many horror stories!
For real, completely tuning out the news is one of the best things I‚Äôve ever done. It only exists to rile people up these days.
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just overreacting, but it just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me that AH is pumping this much

No. Buying calls and buying puts limits your losses to the initial investment.

Selling calls and puts has unlimited losses.

Bought it thinking they've already shown competition with Intel, if they beat earnings *and* their official GPU benchmarks are competitive with Nvidia, they'd get another bump.

Not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't this.

That being said I did pick up 20 more shares today on Fidelity, which is my account that slowly gains money. Robinhood is for losing it quickly.
You could have a landslide victory on this option. But this could also end bad real fast. There is a high possibility for an IV crush on the 4th.
Stocks right now are outrageously overbought (especially tech). The market is tenously built on short-term sentiment. We've seen political news and even social media cause huge swings over the past several weeks, which is not healthy behavior. Fundamentals are irrelevant right now. Chaos in the streets, dogs and cats fucking each other, all that.

A contested election could absolutely be a tipping point.
Truly. Especially with all the ‚Äòmooning‚Äô chatter all the time. Shorted ZM, FVRR, PTON a couple weeks ago ATH. Now sold NIO 36c this morning. We‚Äôll see. But when works out right away, it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòDamn!‚Äô

I got in on BLL today. The factories can't keep up with orders. People loaded up on beer for months. Sports arenas switching from plastic to ball aluminum cups. Earnings are going to 100% exceed expected. Container companies have been mooning.
That's how I used to think until I got assfucked in September and lost 60K profit!

Then changed my strategy to be a bear if required and recovered 10K in last 2 week.
Yes it is. They have a volatility component that is baked into the options pricing. The calls for uvxy have an astonishing 238% IV for calls expiring 11/3. The clear binary event driving IV up in options expiring the next 2 weeks is the election. Which makes sense right? People want to hedge against large moves so they buy UVXY or SPY puts etc. But much like earnings once we know the result of the binary event IV could plummet (especially if none of this doomsday stuff happens). The double whammy is that this underlying‚Äôs price is driven by IV as well lol so if IV drops you lose from both your option‚Äôs delta and its vega.

Yeah there's an evil force about
It's not fearmongering when it's their stated plan that they have carried out at a smaller scale as soon as they think they can make it stick.

I'll just address two points because this could go on forever:

Background checks really aren't the end of the world on their own. But it's the principle of the thing where you need to get cleared by the government before you can exercise your right to defend yourself against that government. Yeah, I know that's all end of the world fantasy stuff. But it might not be the best long term plan to them pick and choose who gets to exercise the rights meant to limit the government's power when the constitution pretty clearly said "shall not be infringed". Then there's the whole slippery slope fallacy that's not always a fallacy when the government starts chipping away at other rights. Or the part where if we all agree to defend the rights of the worst people then we'll defend your rights too. That's some of the reasoning anyway. 

The 2013 handgun thing is some straight retarded bullshit that frankly put me over the edge. Strap in:  So in California we have a "safe handgun roster". The state won't let you buy a handgun that's not on the approved list. To get on the list, manufacturers have to pay like $50k (I don't remember the exact amount) every couple of years to put a gun through some tests. Has to be drop safe and some other stuff. Then they started to realize that this could limit handguns so they let older guns stay grandfathered on the list but newer guns had to have loaded chamber indicators and have magazine release safeties so the gun can't be fired if the magazine is removed. Okay, whatever. But if the manufacturer changes anything on the gun, including the color, then it has to be recertified under the most recent rules. Then Kamila Harris came up with the idea of "microstamping" requirements when she was the Attorney General. In order for a new gun to be added to the roster, the gun has to stamp a serial number on two separate places on the shell casing. This technology does not exist and no gun manufacturer wants to bother inventing it. Democrats cheered because now guns would fall off the roster each year and eventually handguns will be impossible to buy in California. Except that the gun manufacturers have continued to just make the older guns each year. So a few months ago, they changed the law so that the microstamping only has to hit one location on the shell casing, but for every new gun that gets added to the roster three old guns have to get removed. The idea is that now some shady company can just create a cheap gun in a bunch of different colors that stamps the serial number with the firing pin and three times as many guns get removed. Oh, and cops are totally exempt from this law because their union freaked out so they can buy all the unsafe guns that I'm not allowed to have. Now lottery officials, the horse racing board, and some other obscure state officials are recently exempt too. 

You probably don't care about any of that, but it's a crazy example of how this particular political party is using every dumb loophole they can come up with to prevent me from defending myself while they're also defunding the police. Don't get me wrong, Republicans do this cheesy shit too on stuff they don't like, but I'm not okay with any of it and I don't see any evidence of any of them backing off.

It's not all bad, if you bought back the same stock you sold at a loss within 30 days you can still sell that position and wait longer than 30 days and buy back. Do this before the end of 2020 and your capital gains will be reduced by your capital loss come tax day.

Both sides. TW is cheaper because it's $1 round trip. TDA does have free buyback of options under 0.05 though if you're doing theta plays.
Why we do green
Bro this is some gay shit right here. Stop crying over ur 2-day out SPY puts
I mean you lose more by RH not filling your order correctly
Is the .65 TDA fee for options just when you buy or is there another .65 fee when you sell?
This is the oddest thing I have seen on here since the guy that bought $3000 in $1 HTZ putts that expired worthless a full week before it got delisted

You can deduct capital losses up to the amount of capital gains + an extra 3,000. So if overall you lost money and have REALIZED the loss then no, you‚Äôre not on the hook for taxes on the 40k gain.

depending on the news by tomorrow, you gotta switch your side. Your puts will bleed slightly even market open green tomorrow. If there is another rally on Wednesday, your puts will lose most of its value. I cannot tell you about Wednesday but tomorrow will be green by open. And again, don't shoot the gun before you are assure of the direction.

pretty expensive. What's your age and intent? Rent or Buy? want to be closer to work or the bars and clubs? etc. etc. 

&#x200B;

Depending on what environment you're looking for would determine where I'd recommend looking and ultimately the price.

&#x200B;

but expensive. DC is expensive.
I‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre dumb if you buy puts on shit that had a 10% drop in a week or close. Especially on major blue chip stocks
Yo my American gay bears, how many 'hours' are left until the us election results?
I mean this is just naive in a different way, though. Politics haven‚Äôt mattered because they were always a sideshow to us being the greatest country on earth. If the political situation gets bad enough that we no longer are the greatest country on earth‚Äîwhich is absolutely possible‚Äîthen the free money of a long term up market would disappear.
People are overthinking the election. It will turn out to be normal, yes with a few protests here and there, but VIX will drop like a rock.
If you think Biden will Win. Put all your money tomorrow on CRON or ACB. They are small-cap Canabis stocks & usually have a huge jump during election period as you can tell from their chart history. Its a emerging industry and best part is your money wont expire like a contract on you. Id suggest you try CRON. Good luck.
But admit it, you liked it didn't you?

Guests ln talk shows has been saying that about any battleground state. Tbf ill be suprised if Minnesota flipped. It wont tho, we took on a massive amount of immigrants during obama admin.

Dude this is incredibly retarded. Close tomorrow on any spike in volatility but it‚Äôs not looking good. Election uncertainty has been priced in to some extent. Yes, if we go into civil war shit will get worse but that is honestly just a fantasy. ü•≠ will prob lose, make a fit, but that will be that. There will be some protests here and there but we‚Äôre not going into any of these doomsday scenarios. 


We are already at incredibly elevated vol levels. Wed and Fri already put us super high. If things show any semblance of going as expected you‚Äôre going to get double fucked from your option‚Äôs delta as well as the general IV crush these calls are going to experience.

Moved from there a year ago. You‚Äôre looking at 2600 assuming pricing stagnated with Covid flight.

its the opposite imo

i cant speak to how the market will react, but I doubt it drops more than 10% unless the winner loses the senate or whatever and stim talks are forever in limbo

but in terms of other damage, im in the "nothing is gonna happen" camp.

the biggest risk is what Burry warned us about in that last tweet. shadow government (media+intelligence agencies+bigtech)

How could you view election as anything but bearish?

Biden win = GOP is shocked that polls mattered this time compared to 2016. They quickly pull out their money before the commies can tax it

Trump win = huge increase in Google searches for how to move to Canada

Whichever side loses will think it's the end of the world and will be panic selling
Your capital loss will be deducted from your capital gain. However make sure to not buy back the same stock/options you sold at a loss within 30 days. It's called "wash sale" and it will prevent you from claiming the capital loss for this years Tax season.

Could you please post pics?
where you get that info?
It is more complicated than that.  If Trump gets PA then it makes it more likely that other states, with similar demos, also go Trump.  That is why it makes him an underdog.  

Similarly, if FL or AZ go Biden then PA has a larger chance of going Biden.

PA is the current tipping point state though.
Throw in clean energy stocks for Biden and you have a solid plan

Really? I just saw how the right was trying to harass B/H with the caravans. One video shows a right supporter swerving and hitting another vehicle who was a leftist. Who gives af? What‚Äôs the point of acting that way? Both sides are retarded.
Me too.

Any stock I'm going to get assigned on is so volatile I can still make .5-1% per week selling calls at the strike price of the put I was assigned on.

Additionally, I've started actually buying longer dated OTM options to directly hedge my sales so that I can recoup value when the price goes against me.

Cuts down profits, but having that hedge and a defined loss is more than worth it.

Just don't do like I did and sell the hedge early when you think you don't need it because when you do that, the market will always, without fail, move 15-30% against your position üôÉ

yes the question is how significant a dip and then how much would january calls really be affected given that is probably too much time for an inverse ETF. I'd prefer to bet on volatility instead personally but good luck.

Why not just fucking scalp FAANG stocks every day with $50k in capital and make 1-2% a day rather than be a dumbass and play options and lose it all?
That‚Äôs true. But in my opinion a February stimulus is already priced in. If Trump wins, he no longer has the urgency to get something out ASAP. If Biden wins then Trump definitely won‚Äôt do anything until he‚Äôs kicked out. Either way, a February time stimulus is what‚Äôs priced in rn. Remember, the stock marker bottomed in March and we didn‚Äôt get stimulus till June.

Stay safe bro.
No but a drawn-out contested election means no decisions are made, no discussion of stimulus, etc. until sometime early next year potentially. The longer we go the next 3 - 4 months without stimulus, the more small businesses fail, the more households living day-to-day unemployed are strained, etc. All has negative consequences on economy and spending

Can someone explain why futures never match the close price in the first couple of hours? 

The SP500 closed at 3,310 but [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) futures are showing +.18% at 3,309.

Why is it using 3,303 as the "opening price", and why does it always take a couple hours for it to "adjust" to the actual close price for the day?

I wonder if people will burn a cop car in front of my apartment building again if Trump wins. You don‚Äôt need a TV when you have balcony nonsense to watch, beers to drink, and weed to smoke.
All FANGMAN+T earnings were such a big deal. All wondered: What‚Äôs going to happen? Well, all had big moves, yet all within their expected ranges. How does this coincide with tomorrow? Everyone expects the markets to full on moon/drill. How about neither? Expected move for /NQ +-500
Did you not charge your phone to maintain the RED mojo ?
It won't. Your puts will expire worthless my friend.

Since every single person thinks its going down for the election due to instability. Means it‚Äôs going up.

Honestly the only thing I see tanking the market in the near future is Trump losing and refusing to pass any stimulus before he‚Äôs out. He‚Äôs not going to go out gracefully.
They are like around -0.8 correlated historically (so fairly strong negative correlation) but during events this breaks down a lot. Other than that, they don't even track the same products.

Here‚Äôs some facts I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll ignore showing how much tax per capita was paid by each state listed:


Connecticut residents paid an average of $15,643 per person in federal taxes in 2015, according to a report by the Rockefeller Institute of Government. Massachusetts paid $13,582 per person, New Jersey paid $13,137 and New York paid $12,820.

California residents paid an average of $10,510.

At the other end, Mississippi residents paid an average of $5,740 per person, while West Virginia paid $6,349, Kentucky paid $6,626 and South Carolina paid $6,665.




And here‚Äôs some more facts you‚Äôll ignore regarding how much federal $ each state received per dollar they paid in as tax:



Mississippi received $2.13 for every tax dollar the state sent to Washington in 2015, according to the Rockefeller study. West Virginia received $2.07, Kentucky got $1.90 and South Carolina got $1.71.

Meanwhile, New Jersey received 74 cents in federal spending for tax every dollar the state sent to Washington. New York received 81 cents, Connecticut received 82 cents and Massachusetts received 83 cents.
If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôm sure the CIA could hook them up with some pretty good stuff for much cheaper
Yo, I asked this in r/ travel (see profile) but they‚Äôre mega üåà and deleted it. If anyone here could give me insight, even though it is slightly off-topic, I would be greatly appreciative:

I am curious if there are (1) very remote, (2) isolated, but (3) absolutely gorgeous areas of the United States that would be great to build a cabin on. For context, I think solar and starlink are 100% going to make completely off grid luxury habitations possible in the future‚Ä¶ And as a thought experiment I thought it would be cool to gauge the possibility of creating a sort of ultra remote pod where I could work for 3-4 weeks at a time and really have a sort of solitude.

Personally I am because I have an opinion, but I‚Äôd much rather have people who are politically uninformed just sideline rather than blindly filling in a ballot. If you don‚Äôt have the time to watch the news and keep up with the candidates is it really necessary for you to be voting?
Not into US politcs cause im european, but where is Bernie Sanders, and who is this bidet guy?

It's not denial, it's just not succumbing to fearmongering.

Never understood the issue with background checks. An upstanding individual shouldn't have an issue with a background check.

The handgun designed after 2013 law is really weird, I'm not down with that.

Homeowners have been ruthless in capping property taxes so that they can reap the benefits of owning property without having to pay for it. If a person can't afford the property taxes, they need to move. Lower property taxes is part of the reason that real estate prices in CA are so high, along with NIMBYism and the prevention of building additional housing or upzoning. Higher property taxes could lower demand when people can't afford the full cost of the house, which combined with increased supply could reduce housing prices in CA.

Gas taxes are actually insanely low for the cost of roads in this country. State, local, and federal gas taxes only cover 30% of the cost of roads. General taxes cover about 65% so that means people that don't drive have to cover part of the costs of people who do drive.

It's probably why they're adding an extra $100 on the registration for electric cars, so they can still get the funds needed to repair roads.

Remember, leftists actually like guns a lot. It's the center left Dems that want to make it more difficult to obtain a gun. And states like Texas and Arizona aren't gonna go for severe restrictions on gun laws. Dems aren't gonna risk elections by implementing gun laws that lose them electoral votes.

I go small honestly, so not much. I will usually pick up somewhere between 15 and 25 shares and then sell when there is upward movement with any significance. I have quite a few nights where I am netting around 20-30 bucks. Not much, but not a lot of risk usually either. On the days where it has gone the other way, I will just hang on to the shares into the next day. I'm fully loaded with puts, so I see it as a sort of hedge that I can chip away at my cost basis for the puts with.

You should be able to read the room and see the girls there to work and the girls there to work and maybe flirt a little. Most don't like it the same way girls at bars don't like it.

The key is to realize the girl there in the squat rack for an hour with headphones in by herself, crushing her workout at 6am, is not there to flirt.

Not ignoring, but I think your assessment of "the larger the win, the GREATER chance it will be disputed" is incorrect. Also, contentious and up for dispute are two different things IMO.

Trump will try and dispute it, but if the battleground states are won solidly, a lot harder to claim an institution infiltrated an election across the country than if (let's say) Florida were to go blue by 30k votes and Ohio by 15k and Pennsylvania by 20k. Let's put it this way: if the vote is within the margin of error plus the number of mail in ballots that went democrat, that will be your figure to watch. If he loses the state on election day, there's no good argument to be made and SCOTUS will tell him to fuck off. Elections are handled at the state level.
Would have been the play last time for sure

Lol I have them since fall last year. I don't care about a minor blip. Do you know how many times these stocks have dropped double digits in a single day this year?

Trump already has been setting up for a case of voter fraud and mismanagement with the USPS. You're right on the low end, but to say there won't be an issue if the win is on the upper end is ignoring a reality.

A landslide win will be just as contentious as a narrow win.

I got some good premium earlier when IV was outpacing HV but it flipped about a month ago to where buying options was better. It seemed like they were out of cash and shuffled around their C suite. That's all I got for now. I don't know the major players and the environment. For all I know Monsanto or Phillip-Morris could sweep in, buy some infrastructure and steal the market instead of the Canadian startups. I don't know shit

Good lesson to always leave on good terms. 

Now you can reevaluate your options (your job options you addict). You may find a better paid job. I don't know about BK but MCD offers trainings to move up.

No, it's not a fee, commission or other cost. That much he could tell me. He called 'the trading floor', not sure what that means or what they could tell him, but it didn't produce any information. He could see in his backend that these 2 contracts were 'missing' even though they were 'checked out', but other than that he didn't know.

So I got curious and thought I'd ask you geniuses :D.

Guess I'll get news (hopefully) tomorrow. Will update when I do.

I know. Do you think there‚Äôs anyone that can usurp alphabet? It‚Äôs not just google, it‚Äôs a conglomerate, they buy up so many cutting edge startups. The dominance in search and ad space is the float but the real value of the company is the AI development and race to AGI. As well as the Orwellian level of data they have accumulated.

Similar to amazon. Retail is the float.

Real value is the tech and data. Things yahoo never came close to them in.

Guess we find out with time.

‚ÄúFUTES RIPPIN RNNN‚Äù I type as I see we‚Äôre up .2% with no volume or consistency
The struggles ü•¥
Yep pretty much, that said the same can be said for bulls; if there's no clear winner, we are driving SPY down into the dark ages
March 2021 is considered 20 years for WSB
Instead of averaging down (throwing more money into pot) Sell some then buy when it drops more if you still believe. In your case, roll back the date too. (Better advice is just fucking shares)

Learned the costly way, never go all in on calls that expire 6months out on same date. Do it in waves. A lot can change in half a year and premiums will drop unless you're starting at the bottom of a recession (not after 50%+ YTD).
I feel like it‚Äôs virtually foolproof, literally cannot go tits up
Alright, once my fake ass margin call is done I'm doing booking puts. Probally tank by 20% or more. How can you have forward guidance when your entire company is a travel company when countries are locking back up. Now question is..... do I got for this week, or next week?

Why? They crushed earnings and didn‚Äôt get that big of a spike. Also haven‚Äôt exploded like other big tech. They feel like a short term safe haven among tech.

Anti trust is way priced in. And it will be years long and I doubt very much anything changes other than a settlement with some millions paid out.

All you guys talking about energy plays if Biden wins. In order for those to pay out, there needs to be tons of policy passed and years of work against tons of lobbying.

The real play is weed. One quick executive order by Biden and the country opens up.

[deleted]
FL, AZ, GA, and NC. Those states will have their election results in pretty early on the night. If Biden takes 2 or more of those by a wide margin, he‚Äôs won in a **landslide** most likely.

PA, MI, and WI only matter if Trump wins all the other battleground states that he won in 2016. If he loses any of the other states, more likely Biden has won as the night goes on.

Worst case is Dems take the house and senate but somehow lose the White House. 2+ years of nothing getting done‚Äîhopefully a stimulus would be done before the inauguration.

Best case for the market is a clear winner by a landslide on election night, with a sweep of the house/senate as well. Considering there is almost no chance Republicans win the house, I am 100% hoping Biden wins in a landslide. Because that‚Äôs the best case for the market. 

If Biden wins heavily, market is going to quickly price in a giant stimulus happening in Feb. 2021 and a vaccine getting released and mass distributed in 2021 as well.

If Trump wins, market will be sad on stimulus-but possibly still hope a stimulus is passed before inauguration, oil will suck, but there would be vaccine pumps in 2021 to look forward to.

Tech is screwed either scenario because of vaccine.

Early voting typically skews in favor of democrats. Election day voting favors republicans. But early voting has already topped out last years total for the 2016 election. It‚Äôll be close but I think Texas is going blue.

I mean, that makes sense. We have a goddamn plague, mass unemployment, a president threatening to disregard the election, and half the country in denial as their friends and family die... but somehow things have still been growing? I guess the lack of a stimulus plan was the nail in the coffin for the markets last week, although somehow the president's popularity went up.

Really? VW has a contract with Germany to build EVs? Source on that one? I'm surprised the stock didn't shoot up on that news. 

VW has a ton of competition globally outside of that and will continue to have competition as more competitors jump into the EV race, so how much global marketshare they'll have is TBD. I've also read bad things about their current EVs. Articles claim the operating range is poop and the cars fit and finish is also poop. 

When the largest country in the world has invested in one EV car company to supply hundreds of millions of their own country with EVs you take notice. And NIO will go globally as well. 

I haven't purchased any NIO stock but watching how it pans out. On one hand you have China backing this singular company and on the other hand...its China so who knows what will happen.

Ok coo. And according to your flair, you are killing it.
I‚Äôm retarded, how did you make money with a break even price of 40$ ?
It absolutely can, but you can strategize to negate a lot of that with research. You look for low premium stuff, generally generic rounds/bars on sale or "junk" (silver dimes, quarters, half dollars, etc... from before 1965), you see what local coin and pawn shops pay most for in your area, you see what the ebay/facebook marketplace/craigslist situation is, also many of the major bullion sites will actually buy back stuff you've bought from them. Optimally you are only selling when spot price has risen enough and you have enough volume for old premiums/costs not to matter much. There are also some Depositories that you can store your shit at who you can buy and sell silver with at almost spot really fast.

If I have an emergency, I can go down to a specific local pawn shop that will pay a buck under spot for generic silver all day every day.

Bought TAN 50c = 6.80 (Paid Premium of $680)

Option #1 Sell Option

Current Value of Option = $22.50 ($2,210.00)

Total Return = 2,210.00 - $680 = $1,530.00

P/L = 1,530.00 - 680 = **$850**  


Option #2 Exercise Option

Purchase shares: 100 x 50 = 5,000

Sell shares at current price: 100 x 70.15 = 7,015

Intrinsic value = 7,015 - 5,000

Bought TAN 50c = 6.80 (Paid Premium of $680)

Option #1 Sell Option

Current Value of Option = $22.50 ($2,210.00)

Total Return = 2,210.00 - $680 = $1,530.00

P/L = 1,530.00 - 680 = **$850**

&#x200B;

Option #2 Exercise Option 

Purchase shares: 100 x 50 = 5,000

Sell shares at current price: 100 x 70.15 = 7,015

Intrinsic value = 7,015 - 5,000

P/L = 2,015 - $680 = **$1,335**

Bush v Gore ("hanging chads") the market(S&P) puked 7.5+% in the 3 weeks following the election while Florida recounted. "Historians" will point out there was a subsequent rebound but I can tell you right now, this sub would be freaking out if we dropped another 7.5% from here.

Edit - Maybe that's why we've dropped this much in the last few weeks, we've "priced it in".

You'd have to ask someone with experience arranging IPOs how far ahead of time compliance staff are normally hired.  

In my experience those sort of audits are time consuming so it wouldn't surprise me if it would be recommended to hire them a year or two before you want to IPO.

The reason that I can't pin this down is because I truly do not understand orange man. Is he just talking shit or is he willing to really back it up when push comes to shove?

So you have puts on a stock at $20 that is redeemable, in cash, at $20 a share if no merger is made or prior to merger? Man I wondered who bought those fucking puts I sold to insulate against a prolonged period of no movement. I have 1P 1 $30 call per 100 shares so should be a 6-8 y/y% return if it does jack shit and goes down to $20 and 51% if it rallies to 30. The only way to really lose money is to hold thru merger and then it tanks, but you still have warrants to insulate some downside and I don't see people holding thru at $20 a share if sentiment dictates its worth less. Also the more people who bail the more warrants for everyone else, hence the "tontine" structure. Warrants that would have been issued had people not redeemed their shares still go to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
This is the way

II think unless the margin is razor thin, big business will pressure establishment Republicans into recognizing a Biden win.

Trump can whine all he wants, if republicans, business interests and the military all acknowledge Biden win, there‚Äôs not a ton he can do. Trump has pissed off a lot of people who I suspect will drop him the second it‚Äôs clear he no longer has a claim to legitimate power.
You can add solar stonks to this question. I think they might keep going up--Boomers watching election coverage tonight and tomorrow may decide Biden's gonna win it after all and buy in.

I would think 100 would be a huge barrier psychologically just because going from 3 digit to 2 digit seems crazy. But a very smart poster here who has called plays like PINS and SNAP before they happened said that they think AAPL might truly be worth like $90.

The stock has crazy backing though by some very big names. I personally feel like 100 would be hard to break thru unless we have a huge market correction or something.

I'm doin your mom. Yes yours!

I first saw her in the Wal-Mart pickin out your drawers.

Big Dolly Parton hair like an 80s prom queen

But her ass was lookin good all up in those mom-jeans.

I approached her in the checkout line, and said yo baby wassup?

She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin at her jugs.

Five minutes later she agreed to get with me

So we went and rocked the minivan like Giggity. Giggity. Giggity.

I was ridin your mom like she was Mario Kart.

I gave her a lift back to her crib cause her car wouldn't start.

She invited me in the house, and we started makin out again.

How many times I tap that ass? OVER 9000!

Yeah. She called me Pledge cause I knocked the dust off it.

She later made me a sandwich and she cut the crust off it.

Cause she knows how I like it, and that I'm a little young

To be in the bed, butt-naked doin your mom.

I like your mamas big butt, and I cannot lie.

You other brothers can't deny that she's fly.

We make sexy time, yes and every night I tap that.

She saw me butt-naked, now she thinks I'm half black.

But your moms the best, the super M.I.L.F.

Cause she loves to toss the salad even though she ain't a chef

And I blame it on the al-al-al-cohol

But If I were you, I wouldn't kiss your mom on the mouth at all.

She likes the Donkey-Punch. She likes the Dirty Sanchez.

Sometimes she even likes to fool around in your bed.

She likes rough sex with handcuffs and I'll be honest

She likes me to Chris Brown her when she acts like Rihanna.

She's so therapeutic. When I need to cure my restlessness

I br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br motorboat your moms breastestess.

I didn't wanna tell you, but I had to write this song

Cause I'm in your house every night doin your mo-om.

I hold a lot of China (BABA is by far my biggest stock position). The risks are really just technical - ie US administration pushes to delist China co‚Äôs which obviously would decrease demand for China stocks. As an offset, it seems that China as a whole is opening its market up (for example, reduced restrictions on China bond trading). But yeah you should be keenly aware of the China stock risk

Ya. I‚Äôll buy that dip.
They are paying 106.5 a share, so those options are free money.  They would need to back out of deal and somehow have a better offer to hit 110.  It‚Äôs free money for options sellers

No, it won‚Äôt because the 110 is probably higher than the acquisition price would be, unless they renegotiated which is unlikely.  The price usually hovers slightly under the acquisition price, on the slight chance it falls through

For certain laptops like their 16 inch models. Initial rumors are that they will be unveiling two 13 inch models for their event next week, which have never used dedicated GPUs. Once those 16 inch models are unveiled, I would expect AMD to be phased out of apples market plans but it doesn‚Äôt matter as those laptops aren‚Äôt huge sellers for Apple

Looking at DNKN options and the IV is ridiculously low. Pricing is weird too. March 105c is 1.68 while March 110c is .08. Is that because of the share price it‚Äôs being acquired for ? Why were so many people buying the options today?

I get it, it's easy to be in denial and just hope they're not serious. I was in denial about it in California for the last 15 years or so. I kept defending the state and telling everyone that it really wasn't that big of a deal. Now we have background checks to buy ammunition and I can't buy a handgun designed after 2013 brand new from a store, they're slowly trying to repeal the lower property tax laws, they raised gas taxes and make me pay an extra $100 on my car registration for my electric car because they don't get taxes from me at the pump anymore. I could go on and on and I'm sure you've heard it all before and think it's just a California problem. 

I hope you're right on the national level and that moderates will prevail. But I'm living it now and I think everyone is going to be living it soon.
Bro Netflix doesn‚Äôt make money u know that? Creating content is incredibly difficult and doesn‚Äôt leave them a lot of room for profit. I think if u want to go long on one of the big ones Netflix and aapl are the weakest in that list. At least split ur investment to msft and fb or something which are also a household names and would be around for a long time. Good luck with ur investments I hope it works out for u whatever u decide.üòéüëç

Nothing even close to that about China even if you blame them for the early phase of coronavirus.

Jeb!
Takes me years to make that grip. Fuck yea man.
My, although unpopular opinion, is that Biden‚Äôs win will drop the markets in a very short run (nov), but within a month or two will take it to the record highs. The current fcuk up of govt response is what‚Äôs weighing it down. Did you notice that it started dropping when current administration all but admitted that they give up trying to control the pandemic? So yes, I think new administration with a comprehensive plan and new fresh stimulus ejected into the economy will take DOW to 30k within a first week of Biden‚Äôs presidency. just my opinion.

If apple doesn't hit 125 by jan 2022 I'm fucked, and at this point it seems the bubble is popping
Daily average shows a 7 pt range from 120-113 for the past 2 months. You've got a whole mess of fib levels to even get to 137 let alone 150 .I'd rather see you sell everything now and and open a credit put spread (105/102.5) for the same for on a 1.5 : 1 risk:reward ratio with the rest of your money.

The idea here is you are aiming to wager $1.5 to make $1 as long as Apple is over 105 in January. And time is on your side. You wont get back everything but you'll recover \~9k

Im a retard and I feel like its a safe bet. Its a household word in the anglo world and they are moving into the other markets pretty successfully, I like a lot of the foreign content they've gotten. 

Its a company I purchase services from that I think is going to be around awhile. 

I also believe many people such as myself would be happy to pay more money for more content as well. If they figure out how to raise the price I think they got more growth in them than most people expect. 

Again id like to stress that this is not financial advice. I bussed tables for these shares.

No circuit breakers, it will be a slow bleed for many months
If it's flat or mild you lose on both legs and probably get IV crushed along the way. Risk reward is too shitty with current premiums. Better off taking a yolo to one side or waiting for results tbh.

Uhhh, the bigger the win the greater chance it'll be disputed.

There's a sweet spot where it would make sense but if Biden wins by something like 70/30, that'd be an even greater win for Trump to make a stink about voter fraud.

A lot can happen in 136 days.  You've burned some -theta, but you haven't moved your break-even price at expiration.  The difference is that I can buy a $100 call and break-even at $102.56.  You locked in your break-even at $109.  At expiration you have no time value/extrinsic, only intrinsic.
Need to stay informed and voice my opinions as a shareholder.

Buy and hold. Don't pay some high school drop out 3% AUM to pretend like they know what they're doing.

30 days really isn't that bad. In the current market environment it might feel like you're missing out on plays, but the reality is 30 days is still plenty of time. Eventually the market will settle down.

Anyone have thoughts on EA? Doesn‚Äôt seem to have done anywhere near as well as other gaming stocks like ATVI and TTWO since pandemic began, but seems like with they are very good at extracting money through the customer like those loot boxes you have to pay for... considering buying call options.
bullish
Hail Satan
They offer other things as well and its pretty cheap, some people would rather not find laggy streams every time they wanna view something and as its a default app on ROKU it gets a decent amount of exposure
Is this what a hedge is?
The market going to end red or green tomorrow? What about AH after election coverage?
VMW 180 DTE calls
That's a big swing that you're counting on.  Premiums are expensive.  If you're confident, go for it.  Your money.
Y‚Äôall are right :)
Do you ever have a retarded itch to jump into the next play and throw all logic out the window? I close out a successful trade then frantically search for the next one and jump in some horrible fomo trade

Right. The call proves they do stuff.
Don‚Äôt do it man. You‚Äôre dumb mofo thinking TA matters against black swan red wave tsunami coming your way ahead of elections day. It may happen or may not but will most certainly cost you a fortune if you‚Äôre on the wrong side of it. 

Let me tell you a fairy tale. One day Apple goes below 105, and it doesn‚Äôt stay there long, it goes back up to 110 before heading to 95, then 85 etc shit happens. You eat shit and hate yourself for ages just like a horde of bulls that bought Apple pre-split. They still eat shit.
Market crashing. Priced in by market.

Nah lockdowns is bullish for only tech and online based cyclicals. People are going into bankruptcy this time around
Cool.

That has literally nothing to do with my post about the effects on the market though.
I guess the big question is: Do enough idiots with left over money think that the US is gonna make it back economically?  If so, they'll keep buying the dip and prolonging the drop
Bigly green tomorrow, did everyone buy calls?
IV crash
buybacks
Barebacked, no pull out with a thumb somewhere else.

Same concept. Also, Jackie had a no consult agreement with Square. You wouldn‚Äôt want that liability if it were to come into play. Now that she‚Äôs done and free they can more actively look at it without that being an issue.

Why shouldn't I just buy SPY 11/20 $330c and $330p at $10 each if we think the election will produce a wild swing either way? Profit from SPY $350+ or $310-, or about a 6% swing in the next couple weeks?
Ah. You're a man of culture as well
Are most people here still bearish?
We figured that one out? I thought next senate meeting they were going to declare the official RNC version of Asian definitions.

PayPal was overvalued after May anyway. Most of tech was. Apple and PayPal aren‚Äôt comparable since the former offers more to the
General public moving forward with constant catalysts.
where u live?
Socialism dressed up as democracy, hard pass

Just think what will happen to wall street, what will happen to company revenue once the insanely high tax rate is introduced...businesses will move off shore and America will be even more screwed than they were before...guess who the government will have to pass the tax liability onto??? YOU
It‚Äôs up 1% don‚Äôt freak out
More volatility doesn‚Äôt mean stocks go down it means they move more up or down. If you really don‚Äôt think Apple will be higher then it is now by November 10th be my guest and buy puts
New thread. But doing anything with this stock feels ridiculous haha
noticed all the call buying as well, I sold my calls last week but probably jumping back in once the dust settles here and it consolidates a little.

I'm holding SDOW 22P for Nov20. but as for SPY i've just been day trading puts on days where the market tanks.
Lived in the south for a lot of years.  Pretty sure it's y'all.
I'm not calling a rotation cause people sold off tech earnings and had to stick the cash in some other stonks cause they don't want to be out of the market. If the pattern holds, they'll be right back in the same tech within a few weeks.

His supporters would be excited about that prospect
Boys listen. I'm retarded with my timing of buying/selling options and price action, but I think I might understand trends.

The game has already changed unless we get a big surprise tomorrow. Tech calls have been nothing but losers aside from a few gems. Money had been rotating out for some time now. I know you retards don't look at other sectors, but shit is mooning elsewhere.

Unless you want to get completely wiped out, wise the fuck up and stop buying tech calls. You might be able to time a bounce off support or something, but you're gonna lose most of the time. Start looking at industrials, basic materials, construction, and maybe some shit in energy. I might be way off, but this has been the trend as of late.

Of course I get the genius idea just now that if markets are pricing in biden Pot stocks will sore. Why is it always in hindsight that these plays are obvious. Should bought calls friday they woulda printed

Plays  on the upside and hedging the downside or the other way around ?

Gotcha. Godspeed brother, don't go overboard with the risk, you have to earn at least more than the interest you're paying to turn a profit.

Biden win = mask mandate = idiots get forced to wear their damn masks = less people get sick = better recovery with no lock down.

Also vaccine news should be getting dropped shortly after the election according to pfe.

By the time Biden would be sworn in the vaccine should be beginning to get shipped out to folk = no need for a lock down.

Real worry is biden wins = trump goes full fuckin batshit petulant twat and fucks up as much as he can before getting booted. Then we have a sane recovery under a nice slice of milquetoast named biden.

Or trump wins = markets pop for short before the US drowns in its own idiocy.

Also trump wins = shitty stimulus but soon while a biden win = a good stimulus but late.
If it‚Äôs anything like the cruise lines the shitty earnings have been getting priced in for the past month. RCL immediately went up after reporting negative revenues.
Why wouldn't it be?

What do you mean
Honestly, this mostly seems like fearmongering imo. Leftists actually like guns. The only people that don't care for guns are suburban moms. That demographic isn't increasing.

The left has almost never recommended taxes for middle or lower class individuals.

There is nothing happening to guns on a national level in a meaningful way. Sure they'll do stuff like a ban on bump stocks (which a republican president did) but nothing's happening to guns overall. It's all posturing.

At this point, it's more Republican fear-mongering for votes than an actual left-wing initiative.

The Supreme Court has also been conservative for the last 50 years.

Paypal is a prime example of how overvalued tech in general is. At first glance, you'd think it would have room to grow with great earnings, considering all the tech sell-off of the past two weeks. But yet, here we have another 7% lopped off. 11/13 SQQQ calls

I'm not disagreeing with them dumping, I'm just thinking those who were going to, probably already would have. Unless they at waiting to see if more chaos happens.
Cuz this shit is retarded. Trump is so friendly to fossil fuels that it's been cheap for these companies to produce due to guaranteed help from the government, low taxes, and loose regulations. Supply is too high.

In theory, Biden and Democrats would impose more regulations on these companies and move more government money toward green energy. This would raise costs for these companies and possibly cause supply to tighten up, leading to an increase in the price of oil and related things.

Edit: Left one part out. A massive infrastructure bill from Biden would also be predicted to increase demand for oil in the US by a significant amount.

this is interesting. Tell me a bit more, the money that you get will have to be invested in stocks and held as collateral by the bank? Or you had to hand over some previous stock investments (you made earlier prior to applying this loan) to the bank as collateral in order to get the loan?

AMC Chapter 11 is imminent. Very bullish. They can definitely restructure successfully by closing down the weaker theaters as we recover from the pandemic.  If they can somehow survive one more quarter then they‚Äôre likely to be saved from Stimmy II next year.

Imagine buying GM after the bailout 10 years ago only to check and see it at the same IPO price.
could be wrong, that's just my opinion. I just can't rationalize why these companies would be dumping on fantastic numbers otherwise.
Shiiiit! I‚Äôd like to think it was someone‚Äôs last day and they wanted to give a finger to the company on the way out.  Because doing this on accident would just be aweful.

Because the market, like the public at large, only worries about deaths. If deaths stay where they are, the market will probably be rewarded for ignoring it because there will be no more restrictions and the economy will continue improving (though not to 2019 levels for a bit). If deaths start climbing at an alarming rate, which might not happen or might not happen until late November, then the economic recovery will be threatened.

This guy on CNBC saying Democrats need 4 seats to take the Senate for more stimulus, likely won't pass with a GOP Senate.

Dems currently have 47 seats + 4 would be 51. But guy is discounting the fact that Alabama probably going back to GOP so they actually need 5 or they'll only have 50.
I would put any of those firmly in the camp of a trick up their sleeve. I don‚Äôt see any of those companies rushing to inherit AMC with their debt load when they could just buy its assets at liquidation.

Digital-only gaming is really only for very casual players. Streaming games introduces extra lag, making competitive online games such as CoD frustrating. Downloading just a few of the latest AAA games will fill up the Xbox/PS storage and hit whatever data caps your ISP imposes every month. Some people will get by digital only, but I don't see any serious gaming working with the internet services we have right now.

Election vol isn't the only reason why, the numbers these huge companies are dumping over on earnings is indicative of general overvalued pricing, IMO.

SQQQ is a leveraged inverse of QQQ or basically an index of the market. 

That means when QQQ goes up, SQQQ goes down hard. When QQQ goes down, SQQQ goes up bigly. 

It is intended to always go down. Nobody buys and holds this stock. Why? Because overall the market goes up and so the inverse of that would be always go down, especially when it is leveraged. 

It exists as a stock for hedging short term or trying to capitalize on the market performing poorly. Calls on SQQQ are basically puts on QQQ. 

It shows up when you look for VIX stocks but there are no stocks that are directly tied to VIX, this is just an approximation of that. The market could be highly volatile but go up and SQQQ will go down. 

If you're buying SQQQ stocks or calls you are in the same camp as the bear gang and are hoping the market tanks.
Only an idiot invests in AMC, it's going defacto bankrupt. Only chance to make money is to wait til it goes to like $1 and they talk bankruptcy, and buy some in the hope of the retard bounce back to $2.

Famous last words..

Idk man you still have plenty of time to change your mind.
It was a bit of luck. I like to watch the volume throughout the day, for a truly drastic shift you need to have extremely high volume to break through all the limit orders and stop losses. Today we didn't have the volume at any point, look back to Friday last week and end of day there was a massive buy the dip almost identical finish to day.
red or green tomorrow? Considering rallies haven‚Äôt lasted more than two days the past few weeks, I would think red. 

So green?
They *currently* do
It will happen very soon. People haven't paid enough attention to see that money has been rotating out of tech for weeks or even longer now. ER has been a good excuse to dump for the big boys, no matter if they beat or don't. PINS and SNAP were pretty much the last gasps of the great tech rally.

this is what happens when u stay in the casino too long
Same SPY drop happened on TW. Looks like someone mistyped a sell order and got fucked. Either that or did a market order and got fucked.
Should have paid attention to big tech earnings. The market doesn't care that earnings were beat; they are predicting a darker future quarter with election and covid uncertainties. Paypal must have come out with bad projections for the next quarter.

Expectations were priced in

 Seriously if you'd just get puts on each of the tech earnings, statistically you'd be very well off
Imagine being amc
Where are you getting unsecured loans at 4.75%? 

I want to buy puts on the company writing loans like that.
Yup, odte bear got hunted
Honestly no clue
I‚Äôm usually a bull but I think tomorrow is going to be a bloodbath for tech
Or maybe sell that one and buy new otm call if you think its going up
It went down because overall market sentiment is poor, despite solid earnings and PayPal increasing guidance, this market will sell anything and everything off before election. My advice for you is to buy PayPal LEAP calls. This will be over 200+ by next year. I have PayPal $300 2022 calls that I will sit on comfortably
I‚Äôm so depressed in the span of August to now, I turned 4k into 35k back to 4k...

Still within my hold short signal, but must admit this was a good capture for the bulls today. 330 paves the way for 340. 

VIX held its weight though today, clearly volatility is not done and today was just an up date amidst a volatile down trend. 

Anything could happen, tomorrow gonna be a roller coaster.

Bro... the entire reason XLE mooned today is because they are betting on a Biden win. Trump is bearish for that shit
It is.  I bet there are more players who sustain a serious injury or have other accidents that knocked them out of college ball who could have played in the NFL, than there are players in the NFL.

Also hedge funds are a massive case of survivorship bias.  On average they perform worse than index ETFs, but people cherry pick the few lucky ones as examples of "genius".

It's all bullshit and the people on top always got there due to a massive amount of luck, true straight across life.

Most contentious country-wide multiple choice looming, WH barricaded, national guard deployed across the country. EU going into lockdowns (do we need to say EU + Britain now?), shooting in Vienna, police action in Spain.

SPY - I'm gonna go up.

Does anyone think this is anything but a bounce from Friday?
Yea CHWY had lot of momentum taking it to 70 with telemedicine and sell off robbed it off that.
Losing money looks great on you

Literally everything turned from bearish to bullish within less than 24 hrs 

Indices, commodities, currencies, everything
I'm fucking dead. That was so unexpected and fits perfectly
to be fair, i thought the same thing about today. But it should be even more true for tomorrow
All of us are indeed!
Hol up, imma need to buy a dog first
Shoulda have bought butt coin instead
Oof
If you got the funds, just inverse an up or down day for like 10% 2 weeks out

Here's my wishlist for Wednesday morning:

\-AAPL @ $100

\-ROKU @ $180

\-DKNG @ $32

\-FSLY @ $60
How far out?
Earnings already came out. And it got shafted
Buy more

$PYPL | Paypal Q320 Earnings:

I guess my ICLN leaps will suffer... AGAIN lol
Man, if you don‚Äôt know: 1) the election outcome (both President and Senate); 2) the turmoil to get there (is there a concession or litigation); and 3) how bad will Covid be after Thanksgiving; then you don‚Äôt know what the market is going to do this month.
$AMC ‚Äòs cash flow for the quarter was -$342.4M and available cash is $417.9M. Ouch.
They charge you 10% of the winnings and 5% of your whole account to remove money. So you YOLO and win like 1% waste of time IMO
New strategy instead of listening to all the advice of others and analysts saying ATVI is worth $100, bought puts today because the only reason it‚Äôs makes sense that it‚Äôs going down is because MMs are pulling out its 93% institutionaly owned. So if they pull out they have to now pay my ass üåàüêª
Your Canadian worry about Justin trudgay than the US election

-100%
You know that there are more than 1 million autists/retards on here, right? So some will say this, and others this. Just bc you've seen 20 comments saying bears r fuk and 20 other comments saying bulls r fuk doesn't fucking mean that those are the same people. But that would imply that you can count to 20, which would put you among the highest ranking IQ's on here.
I think we have surge of blind retail investors this year ... beat earnings sell off wtf
Who gives a shit? This fucking loser couldn't hold a candle to Abe Froman. Abe Froman has guys like him killed everyday.
Yah correct...I mean God damn, I wasn't talking about him losing the fucking house and kids and cars lol...
The things with PYPL you people dont understand is that its a profitable company... 

buy puts, 150 EOY
This was last week yo.

you are late mo fo.

this week make bets on the winner. XLE yolo here.
Day trading/options trading is very similar to roulette. 

The more you hedge, the lower your profit is.

The more you bet, the more your profit could be.  

If you put your whole stack on red (puts) or black (calls) you could lose everything. It doesn't matter if it has hit red 100 times in a row, that doesn't mean it will hit black. 

You can only hedge so far until your profit is nullified or negative so you have to take risks to play 

Even the best strategies can lose based on factors entirely out of your control.
It‚Äôs relatively flat today. Some minor ups and downs but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs staying in place.
Use something that doesn‚Äôt use single use plastic pods. Sorry, not trying to set a rude tone, it‚Äôs just reeeeeaaalllyyyy bad for the environment

I think PYPL goes green by morning or EOD tomorrow, they did this a couple of earnings ago and mooned the next day.
Shieeeet boys i forgot to sell my amazon call before close.  Wish me luck for tomorrow
Y'all really surprised by the script of bloated forward multiple -> moderate QoQ growth -> dump? Still?

Beating earnings isn't enough when absolutely crushing them is priced in

This is like the 3rd time it‚Äôs happened to me, I‚Äôm such a dumbass dude
100% you just played with stonks
Awesome market, AMC miss expectation stock goes up, PYPL beats and goes down!!!!!!
I would say this has a 75% to be true. Orange man will not accept a defeat. He will cry fake news, fake polls, cheating with mail in ballots. Etc.
[deleted]
Wouldn‚Äôt that be something?
LEAP
It doesn‚Äôt matter who wins the election, lockdown or no lockdown, stimi deal or no stimi deal, TSLA will moon and go up at least another 69% by Jan 8th.

This is only my forecast based on fundamentals.
PayPal another victim of beating earnings
Wait wtf website is this. This is the easiest bet ever.
Iron COndors on SPy till a direction is certain. This flat shit between 320 - 340 is lame
I am disappointed in myself and my trading abilities
Y‚Äôall realize every stock that beats earnings just ranks right lol. And y‚Äôall still played PayPal and Solaredge.

Seriously all my homies hate paypal
A gay bull. What have we done? What monster have we created?
I demand he DOESNT do it and just gets banned for being open to molest his dog
Whats the Projected ROI?
Yeah, I banking on the momentum last month. Kinda ran out of steam. Not sure what my play is yet. Going to see what earnings holds first
#Cause tonight for the first time Just about half-past ten
4 more years of Covid?
I think you're good all the pumping today seemed fake as fuck.
Gotcha, what can you do, maybe he just feels comfort there.
WSB's new chicken vs egg: EVs pump because of TSLA; TSLA pumps because of other EVs.

Tesla was the obvious prime mover until about a month ago but now not so sure.
I wish, no, especially after these past few weeks, I don‚Äôt have that much. I am just very frugal and got in the habit of not spending money until my student loans were paid off, but then just kept that habit and put it all in the market/savings.

Well AMC gong to the center of the earth üòÇüòÇ
PYPL down 4% on a solid beat and raise. Makes sense? Lol
Username checks out. üëç
I‚Äôll get out tomorrow
I believe several states have decriminalizing MJ on the ballot. There‚Äôs a good chance some of, if not all, will pass and this is likely why those stocks are rising today.
cause most tech had crazy earnings and dumped?
i'm scare. i want my mama for tomorrow.
FWIW I'm all in on puts and ended the day -5%, feeling good from here.
tda
Bruh SEDG DROPPED like a motherfucker
yes I did it 300usd bet on trump winning
Thats a severe market crash
If it goes bankrupt you have to buy them for the strike and then the stock itself is worthless so that's money down the drain but technically the loss is limited to the strike price x100. A naked call, that one can go to infinite if the stock goes to infinity
Great isn't Great anymore. need to smash earnings.
RIP PayPal. Another one bites the dust.

It is beyond me why anyone thinks we have a green day tomorrow. Holding puts tightly
T\_T sameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Careful brother, IV is too damn high; and that crush will be real if it comes.
yup, 1 share comes with 2/9 of a warrant.  So 9 shares gets you 2 warrants.
Well 5000 strike will do that
Yes BossBabe.
Literally happened to everything last week
I‚Äôve never seen a comment that resonates this much with me

I think puts before tech earnings is the way to go. Out of AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TWTR, AMZN, PYPL only GOOG was up, rest all drilled to the core.
Sell before tomorrow, you fool
Techpocalypse!!

That being said have a nice afternoon!

Hey man, if people out here talkin shit to me and then end up being wrong then i got every right to laugh in their face.
And then what happens when your shit falls way OTM
Pypl is just backing up to get a running start
Only boomers use EBay.  Puts
WSB still bearish (-17 for bearish vs bullish).

You know what that means tomorrow üëÄüëÄ
You can no longer sell them as soon as normal market hours ends on the day of expiration. If the option is in the money and you have the money to exercise then you can exercise the option. SPY options can be traded up to 15 mins after closing on the day of expiration unlike other options.

The last 2 quarters where this has happened. Also last week when tech took it sans lube
Don‚Äôt know when but CHWY will offer pet insurance. They talked about telemedicine last quarter and they recently announced it. Insurance isn‚Äôt a big leap for them. Thought I‚Äôll throw this out there since I‚Äôve keep following chewy for some reason.

Great earnings + raised guidance for PYPL. What am i missing?
The numbers looked better than expected. Not sure what they are not liking. No guidance?
Try it, it will still be down.
You should try a broker thats not Robinhood...
They have puts expiring Tuesday now?
You'd miss tendies by the time that happens, oh well.

It expires on a Friday, so wait until Friday of expiration to decide if you‚Äôre closing or rolling. I always set mine to close for .1 so if at anytime it moons, it just auto closes for me. That also keeps freeing up my buying power for me. Or close early if you hit 50% profit before expiration

My bad, I did not pay attention to that. 

Then maybe fear about Biden losing the election? Because Biden promotes green energy, and these stocks rise a lot in the past months.
Tomorrow‚Äôs Futures gonna be FIRE
BRO you just walked away from a homerun. Honestly just put in a limit to buy like 50 shares at 5.90. You might be able to pick them up in Early Market and hold them into a Biden America for some serious change.

Ppl buying earnings FDs a day before a US election are crazy motherfuckers.
this is not a political statement, but market pumps on dem win.  did you forget about stimuluis?

You did brotha, I would have followed but was too risk off to do any ER trades. Thanks for the tip.
ayeeee i perfectly timed that paypal exit for once i dont get fucked raw
Get a sense of humor party pooper
I had 10 spy 330 puts odte that I bought for .7 today. Saw market was tanking but got called into a meeting so I put  limit order at 3.  It literally went up to 2.95 and then bled the rest of the day. So instead of making 3k today I lost 500. Puts on my boss if he thinks I'm going to work hard this week after that
Pussy shares. Buy calls. Get rich. Fuck bitches.

No risk guaranteed loss
Didn't realize PYPL earnings were today. That's 9 earnings in a row I got cucked on
Yessss pypl don't move for me baby. My strangles can only make so much

i sold you the calls. CHA FUCKING  CHINGGGG
I mean I really don‚Äôt want him to do this, so can we just ban him? THE DOG KNEW IT WOULDNT BE RED, HE DOESNT WANT THIS.
Ahh yes, isolating my worst play make the rest of them irrelevant. Got it. I wish I could make no bad plays.
The worst case is scenario is.... market is flat.
lol got outta my paypal shares whoooohhhhooooo, now lets watch it soar with out me!

Not if you were to measure uncertainty by using the VIX.  2017 was the least volatile year in decades.  Despite all our fond memories of market manipulating tweets, Trump has given us comatose levels of volatility.

you did right, it is wiser if you get calls
Just a quick stat, the market dumps on the election day and after election day if the dem wins. So all hopes are not lost on my SPY 325p.

That‚Äôs how overvalued companies react after smashing earnings.
No there is no risk at all.  There is a huge sellers market to sell one cent options...no wait.
You can spot someone that is overleveraged when they post about a drill or a moon and you go check and the shit's moved .007% percent.

It wont do anything to the market imo but thats some scary shit
Worst possible case is nuclear holocaust and the stock market ceases to exist
Average down
AMD stock buy of XLNX is a huge L. Apple moving to ARM is also a big L to them as more companies will switch from x86.
That's the move I'd make. This is going to be a huge IV crush I think.
Dum dum
Contested, Trump tries to move into the courts tmo
And so does AMC
I already have a sink fuck off sink salesperson
I‚Äôm thinking sell off for sure if we‚Äôre contested or even delayed tbh.
Most of the time they're sold in 5 cent increments, so you have to purchase at .05 anyway...which means that the second you purchase them for $0.05, when you look at your daily prof/loss, you'll show a .04 loss on each one.
[deleted]
!Retards, quick question - Tomorrow:

1) Circuit Breaker

2) Hulk Dildo
less uppies
So SPY 320p tomorrow is gonna print or am I a dummy?
Biden win. GOP wins senate. 

Which could mean no stimmy until 1/2021 at the earliest.
I guess the logic is that if SEDG missed, Enphase probably missed too.

Its highly contested and you get to buy everything on sale 1wk to 1mo later.
Why is your screenshot blurry?
This is why I only play ITM leaps when buying options, OTM plays are for theta gang
SEDG is part of that ETF portfolio. Take a look at it.
Thanks for taking the time.
I been selling puts on F and GE for a couple months now. Also VALE and KMI
Last thing I heard was their C.E.O is expecting company to bankrupt. Any thing changed recently or bankruptcy is the new bull just like hertz?
tanks like a hot balloon

yes a hot balloon...nothing makes sense anymore
I don‚Äôt care all in TAN leaps at open
It seems you like to ride the roller coaster
Biden wins, Trump declares victory as well. In this case, everything U.S. related tanks - bonds, equities, the dollar, and protestors as the military runs them over
Everi deciding to jack me off after hours
Chaos and lawsuits.
Only reason why we didn't drop today tbh

Algos will adjust on a daily basis. Its not always the same dealers buying selling. Usually they have other hedges so they don't have to buy/sell. IDK, honestly we'll see. Anything can happen.
I feel like I'm getting corona... I'm becoming part of the undead
What you mean
Did you say Nikola?
SEDG down 14 percent AH
Too many people are saying this...and for that reason im out....but i might buy a couple just in case

What‚Äôs the worst possible case for the market based on the election?
I have a few put SPY 320/310 debit spreads expiring in December and then some $310 Puts 12/4. I picked up a couple call debit spreads, and vxx puts to hedge though
I mean, I'm not sure [which chart these bulls are looking at...](https://i.imgur.com/efn2iNs.png)
weed stocks are the shittiest fucking plays last earnings I had some calls and never again.  once is enough.
I was told that its becoz of Solaredge earnings dump.
So glad I got out of SEDG. My TAN and ICLN holdings will suffer though
Spwr down 2% ? Gasp! You must be new to this loveable schizo of a stock
im shorting the vix. yeah, so?
They do not sell for .01 but half the time they do go up a few cents but the other half you‚Äôll never be able to sell/will expire worthless.

I was looking at options earlier and saw one was for $20 ($10 below current stock price)w a 19 strike or some shit but it was up 1,555 for the day. How that works? Is it volume? 

I have no current positions to post bc i cashed out this morning realizing i have more to learn before yoloing my savings like a straight bitch.
Chickened out of buying NIO $35 calls. I bet I‚Äôm gonna regret that decision üòî
I said SEDG puts were free money
If pypl moons I‚Äôm out the game
nope, it is the opposite, everyone is expecting a drop and got put

that is why MM will decide green tomorrow.

This is a business, MM is always looking for profit
WHAT HAPPENED TO SDGE
So will watching the elections tomorrow night.

Why is plug up ah again? I thought sedg earnings would have dragged it down.
5th amendment right is to stfu, so I'd say you had that pretty enforced.
imagine buying any LP when MSOs exist, baby brain moves
Crayon boys what kinda candle is that on a gap up day?
Stocks go up, stocks go down, sometimes stocks go round and round
Uh wut, it dropped 30 cents and is moving back up.

Not saying it means we're not bullish, but saying VXX is drilling is misleading
Nah trust me they're complete shit but I will say this... there's a couple pennies that have made me a fortune with options. Only go for pennies with a big catalyst or PDUFA coming then sell the hype. I did that with TRVN and some other stock, both made me a sweet safe 100%+ return. Overall they're shit though.
civil disobedience/unrest
Surprised no one's being talking about the UBER/LYFT short DD. Massive opportunity if Prop 22 is rejected; UBER and LYFT have a good chance of going bankrupt off of losing the California market alone.
IV is bigly spiked sir! Shoulda sold slightly ITM call credit spreads.

Trumps twitter has me thinking it's contested too...but Biden is crushing polls rn with TX as a tossup
Tears only go down.
Michael VIX did all he could today but the bulls defense was well prepared and keyed in perfectly to stop him from any big gains, in particular Blackrock was all over the field today, you saw Blackrock getting into the backfield, in pass coverage, just a phenomenal effort all around. After an up-and-down game, VIX will have to be ready for this quick turnaround coming into a crucial game tomorrow.

SEDG beat, why the drop?
It‚Äôs like playing price is right high or low.

I was gonna go puts
Just did the math. If I had never found WSB and had just dumped all my money into some shit stock like Ford I‚Äôd be up about $10k today.
maybe Google will buy it or something

Market will end flat tomorrow, just like today. Sell offs already occurred and money isn‚Äôt going to come pouring back in until after election.
Probably a specialist doing some EOD clearing
AMC is the next HTZ!
Post-election republican senates are not known for doing that
been doing that for the last 2 weeks...the lows keep going lower, and even highs are lower

Yo. This is the type of thing that makes me super bullish on DKNG. Taking money from gamblers without the overhead of a casino.
If tomorrow both the candidates electoral colleges are neck to neck then people will go throat to throat in the streets until all the mail-in ballots are counted which may take until end of this week.

AMC is about to explode. Sorry put holders. I hope your anus is ready for what about to unfold
Bought SPY puts during the first dump, was up $300 now closed -$124 on em. Diamond handing this motherfucker, it‚Äôs already going down AH
Already priced in
Why did SEDG fall off of a cliff? The earnings smashed?
$330, my bad
SEDG off a cliff!!!
The OI is way higher on 11/04 strikes tho
Why is TAN shedding AH? Is üò¥ Joe not winning?

Sold my 300 11/18 SPY puts for the 1 day theta loss today (-10%).  Should've closed on Friday (+30%) at a couple of points in the day :(.

All in all, a WSB trade that only loses 10% is really a win.
Theta gang will win
Yes.

Correct me if I'm wrong though but ofcourse this is intended to prop up the market, but for talks sake there is another quite noticeable if not as drastic a drop as March would that not make things go tits up big time with the already inflated dollar?
its still below its 100day ma.. wouldnt go near it until its back above \~3300.

They don't move.  They are terrible.  Buy a decent stock in the couple dollar range if anything.
leveraged ETF have time decay.. basically options in a sense
Well I predicted we'd hit 1 or 1.5% and then finish around half a percent up (last night).  Not bad honestly, had it pretty close.  No EOD sell off but other then that picked the direction pretty well.
Who cares about the product it's about the stock. Don't tell me you're gonna drive a nio lmao

Yes, FANG and RTX. If Biden wins, people are going to panic sell government contractors (RTX) even though it is fantastic value currently. With Libya trying to pump the market full of oil, FANG moved up too much today. I believe it goes down end of week, but back up EOY.
Nobody liking my comments.  Is this thing on?  Hello?

Edit: ok, enough, it works!!
Ugh, is this what bears felt like every time they opened their RH account today?

My friend bought aapl calls when it was like 125 back in August. I told him it was retarded but he did it anyway and is still holding them down 80%

Shit is all solar gonna dump now?
I said it doesn‚Äôt preclude, meaning you can be a bull/bear and employ theta gang directional strategies.
I really wish I didn't drop my 4.5 11/6 calls this morning. I expected ACB to drop today after a strong start.
there's lots of new information coming out every minute, hour of the day and the stocks react to them, so there's no way to predict anything, but over the long term, i think TA always works.
we literally closed flat today, the remaining days are going to be some violent moves
42.50 Bob
Yeah it's not really my last 700 dollars to my name but it is he last of the "money that would be really nice to have"

where my NIO call holders at ?!
As you can see by my RKT and DKNG covered calls I play some theta gang as well. 

Theta on my PFE leap is -0.0045, NIO leap is -0.0236, CGC is -0.0135, WMT is -0.0214. 

Unless I'm misunderstanding theta decay, I don't think those are too bad. I'm certainly open to others opinions on whether I'm looking at that the right way.

Why is TAN shedding AH? Is üò¥ Joe not winning?
Mango doing the same thing I do... repeatedly spam something on a social media platform for it to come true. Please tank CRM so I can buy in cheaper.

Wow so my 10 cent yolo ACB calls went to like 3 cents last week and are back to break even. I've got like 1k total on it just for fun but I'll

People keep saying that, but I've seen their vague plans come to life in CA. And now Virginia has seen it too. There's a standard playbook they run through. 

On a national level they'll start small with the red flag laws and deeper background checks, and banning extra scary stuff that they think will stick. The only reason they might hold off going further is because the Supreme Court is conservative now, but I don't put all my faith in them to push back too much.

In a few more years, all the old guard of the party will retire and the radicals will try to take over if the country hasn't had an assfull of them by then. I don't think they're patient enough to play the long game and they might start to overreach too fast with everything. But we'll see what happens when we get there. 

It's all fun and games until people get burned by some dumb gun control law themselves or see their taxes take a sudden jump when they thought they were only going to go after rich people.

And it's fucking wild dude. There is 88 paper oz of gold for every physical oz and 178 paper oz of silver for every physical oz, and every time the physical price starts to climb to hard they add more paper shares to drive the price back down somewhat. It's like a hyper manipulated retarded version of fractional reserve lending, but it will bite them hard in the ass eventually if things get bad for prices to climb enough to cause a physical run (probably in the $40-50 range)... That's why I hold both. Paper silver makes money (for now) but physical is going to fucking print. I'm still super green on the stack I accumulated at the beginning of the year when spot price was just 16-18 an oz.

I believe that retail investors have accounted for about 20-25% of investment activity recently. That large percentage may be due to the fact that a lot of wealthy people have been sitting out in mostly cash for the past 3 months or investment houses have been quietly pile-driving money into China investments while our government leaders and mainstream media have been loudly warning the American public that Chinese stocks bad and dangerous. 

So retail investors have had an outsized influence in the US stock market in the last 3 months.

Look, most of the people in this sub work in the restaurant industry and live at home.

I believe it will pay off in spades going into Xmas and next quarter will be better than anyone anticipates.

Amazon has created a runway for near future that will be used atleast until the vaccine is there. They are well prepared and then some more.

There is no escaping some companies. Amazon is one of them. Every analyst estimate out there is 3500+ .

These prices will not be there for long and once gone, they will stay gone.

Inverse WSB, they say.

WSB almost always buys at the top. Top on Purple, Silver, Tesla Battery day, SPY 360, and even GME at $15 etc.
More importantly, I think J Powell will be. 

But to answer your question, I think it depends on if Republicans can still maintain enough seats to filibuster a tax hike. So if they can keep 46 senate seats then yeah, best case scenario honestly.

Shut up nerd, back to the basement with you

Morning drop,  mid day bump , with a little straddle , then power hour. Pretty much
Jacked to the tits on 329/328 debit spreads for SPY 11/4

Also some vxx calls hoping we see an epic short squeeze
I don't understand, did Apple kill someone? Why are they still dropping? They're probably one of 5 companies that actually make sense to be overvalued. I'm not holding anything for them but it just annoys me
The list goes on and on and on
You know we are retards, what did you expect?
Today didn't go ANYTHING like people over the weekend thought it would... Once again, following WSB has fucked me in the a$$
cant wait to wake up to nio gapping up tomorrow
The type of people who visit Texas Roadhouse is almost a complete circle vinn diagram with those that don‚Äôt wear masks.

Right? Like they're all going to suddenly agree the day before the election.
Weak dick syndrome
Or, you know, since I think they'll get bought, but I can't pinpoint a price, maybe I should just sit on the shares.

And the options premiums aren't very high.
Based on every other tech earnings, I have zero reason to believe Paypal will react positively to earnings. BUT I still believe!
lol, I guaranteed you we are up tomorrow.
I know ü§£ü§£ I have a Charles Schwab but was to lazy to use it
Market may be volatile but mods are always gay
You're cute.
So is WSB back to being bullish?
Jesus fuck snap
These tech stonks are over sold and will not drop anymore. Just sayin
$50
YSK 10yrs warranty is only for fridge not for the trades that take place on it

Every news is bullish. Civil war? bullish
I dont see Zillow nor FNKO on this they‚Äôre both abt to blow out earnings
ANET üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
ES_F 3270 held and we had a healthy bounce up. 3380 is up next and I fully expect the pajama traders to go poke around in that area this evening.
Yea go buy some F and GE you damn dirty hippie
Turned bearish at the last minute

GUH
Everyone rushing back in for cheap stock.
PYPL going to print bois?
Can‚Äôt go tits up if it‚Äôs already tits up
Lol at every one saying it was flat. If you all saw that today's implied move was 10% less than Friday and 15% less than tomorrow.

My short strangles minted today from that vol collapse
they are going to eat our kids and grill our dogs

put spreads don't really take advantage of high IV the way CSPs do. they are more directional plays unless your strikes are quite wide

I don't have a dog in this fight (not American and don't vote even where I am from) but I find US elections kind of fascinating. I will be staying up until morning most likely to see how US election ends up, and probably end up getting absolutely drunk while watching the coverage. I think both Biden or Trump winning can happen so it should be fun watching the live coverage.
Getting out of spy puts cuz this week is gonna be green af
Bruh the market does the opposite of what everyone thinks it will do. I too fall into this trap every fucking time
Same, made $181. We must have the same portfolio.
Markets don't know election outcome either. They are just as autistic as WSB ü§°ü§°
Where is the mm pulling out?
Can we cancel the political commentary rule for the next day? To be completely honest, it‚Äôs a ridiculous rule on Election Day.

Of course they had to CLOSE AT 330 SPY
Any catalysts tomo?
Hey guys! New options trader here. I was wondering if some of you more experienced heads could give your honest opinions on my proposed first options trade, and whether you think it‚Äôs a solid play or not.

I am thinking about buying a couple PUTS (Ask:$5.30/70 strike/ Exp: Dec 18) on [TXRH] more commonly known as ‚ÄúTexas Roadhouse‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôll revisit the lows of March in the coming months but imo, I feel that the market is due to pull back significantly and I think rising case numbers coupled with potentially mass civil unrest (regardless of who takes the election) along with fading stimulus hopes, could be the catalyst. Even if restaurants manage to stay open as things get worse, it wouldn‚Äôt take a total shut down of this company for the price of the stock to plummet am I correct? As things get worst with flu season, investor sentiment alone could tank the stock and the odds of that being the case are more probable than not yes? 

I‚Äôm always looking to learn from experienced investors so thanks for taking the time to give your input.
Its priced in.
Look up MOC orders

Feels like a win
I heard Costco had to change their return policy because people were returning mattresses and computers 5 years after they bought them.

The article says people were returning Christmas trees in January... that is pretty creative.

Still sucked tho.
Being theta gang doesn‚Äôt preclude bullish/bearish positions

Shocked that I barely avoided the temptation to buy SPY puts right before close. I had my finger on the trigger and walked away. Since I didn‚Äôt do it we‚Äôll probably crash tomorrow.

closed at $330. LMFAO totally not rigged total organic market.
One old retired dude has been on a crusade to outlaw gas powered leaf blowers because it disturbs the peace. He puts these long rants up. 

Some women today posted about how she ran into a kind young man who gave her an extra üò¥ Joe yard sign and then a kid drove by and yelled at her for supporting üò¥. She said it really hurt her feelings and she was afraid for her life.   

It‚Äôs fucking insane. All these pearl clutching boomers talking about their fragile lives. 

Fuck. The generation after the Greatest Generation are a bunch of pussies.

Well said. 

So many funds will be rebalancing as we come into the end of Q4 & the year. Seems like they‚Äôre switching to financials & value expecting bigger growth in those areas for 2021 vs tech.
Yes why would we be red? We already dipped hard last week
It's always the biggest election in history
What do you call if you are bull/bear and theta gang?
There‚Äôs at least one dipshit out on this thread that will YOLO his life savings into the right directional play on his first day trading options. It‚Äôll change his life forever, he will post gain porn. He‚Äôll then post his entire account blowing up by day after tomorrow.

EOD PUMP IS A LIE
Damn they‚Äôre still making clothing? Remember how popular that shit was in the early 2000‚Äôs
Why a Euro dump?
I think having two parties claiming the election will probably have bigger impacts if it leads to serious civil unrest. Especially if that means that no stimmy gets passed
Wholly fuck.. this beyond pathetic/sad 


https://twitter.com/reuters/status/1323309737962885121?s=21
Agreed. I see a bloodbath over the next couple weeks which should print my 12/31 SPY puts which are already up to begin with. My LEAPS were cheap entries and IV and Theta seem favorable so if shit hit's the fan short term like I expect, I'll take profits on my SPY puts and roll that into my LEAP positions and average down. I might be a retard but I'm a retard with a plan...
Jeez those last pumps really fucked me up
Nice. I'm selling naked strangles so I'm making money slower but have been green on a lot of up and down days.

If you think üêª asshole is gaped today, wait for the election to be decided when an avalanche of cash worth trillions comes pouring into the market.
I don‚Äôt even know what it is but I just bought in
Depending on the temp it might be okay. If you go camping and it‚Äôs not super cold you can bury water in the snow and it will retain enough heat to keep from freezing, and alcohol has a much lower freezing point. I guess it all depends on how long it was outside and where.
i hope so
Fubo is going to sky rocket. You heard it hear first. Will hit 20 by end of November. Sky is the limit with them. Like buying Netflix at $15 a share.
wait for a clear bottom it's still consolidating.

Long SQQQ under 24 or buy calls and pick your yacht retard
I am in fairly big (for my portfolio) on Nio and Baba (20% each).  But I don't do options because when I try there is too much loss in theta value thst eats gains.  I think both are long term winners and will kill it in a year or less.

>My buddy at TRP gave up on trading because of it.

This is exactly how i feel at this moment. Despite following the policy in 99.9% cases, those unintentional .1% transactions bite you in the ass. 

I'm just wondering if i should be just buy and hold investor or have someone else manage my account for a fee.
Looks like all of tech is correcting right now, I dunno if there's any reason behind it though
Buy VXX calls. It‚Äôs free money for tomorrow probably. Who fucking knows. But I‚Äôm all in on VXX 11/6 $27.50C
Europe is fucked
I am. Calls for March and April that I bought last week though.
nio shares/leaps
Because it might explode from the pressure if it freezes. If you want a cold drink but can‚Äôt keep it in the fridge (like a normal person would) you can quickly cool it down by wrapping a wet tissue around it and putting it in the freezer for a couple of minutes. Cheers!

Also, don‚Äôt drink every night.
I want to go in but what‚Äôs the highest it runs  to tomorrow realistically? IV is 220%

Placed my bets for the week.

Told myself I would buy Amazon shares under 3k.

In on ICLN and VXX puts for a clear Biden victory, which Trump will obviously raise a circus about, but the markets won‚Äôt buy it. Volatility unwinds.

Corsair used to be my bread and butter. Now it‚Äôs fucking my shit up.
Quicker just to light your money on fire.  LOL.
one of those days were if you held from Friday you got fucked and if you bought at open you probably got fucked.  Oh well, try again tmr.
CRSR is below $23 should I get in the shares again?
That's all very fair, and I agree that it's a long road to becoming seriously profitable businesses for weed companies. Not planning on holding these for the long term. I do think they would get a solid bump from a Biden win on hype alone. There is for sure going to be a big reaction in certain stocks depending on the outcome. If Biden wins decisively, prison and oil stocks will be deep red, weed, gun, and renewable stocks will be bigly green imo
Euro dump is going to be epic

Lol cant argue that logic. Best of luck to you. what are your 12/31 options for SPY? SPY and GLD have been my favorite this year.

Bullish if TSLA closes above 400
[deleted]
Yeah exactly, specially that magsafe thing
Look at their value pre-corona.

Since then they have been diluted to about 30% of that value, so around $5-$6.

They have missed last two earnings, and have Q3 earnings in another week or so, which they *should* beat, as all mortgage companies are beating earnings right now (unless they are huge fuckups, since everyone is buying and doing refis)

Price will likely jump to $3.5 or $4 at that point = $$$$$$.  Look how cheap the $3 calls are for Nov 20th.  If it hits $4, which is totally feasible, you could 10x or more.
Yeah, dealers are trying mad hard to get it to 330 probably but selling pressure right now is too high.
I included SLV. But even threads about that are gone.
ACB calls 11/13? Anybody else in them? With 5 states voting to legalize...

For the first time I made money from every single trades today. All of them are SPY puts.
Try Robinhood, the basement dwellers crowed

Free money for the taking, gains for days!

Your job is such a sad and dreary road,

So ditch the paycheck for these solid plays.

The rich make money just for being rich,

Upon the backs of poors like you and me.

So ride that market, ride it like a bitch!

Like Sherwood's savior, heroes we will be.

I placed my bets, the dreams of riches near,

Picked calls and puts with care and mother's love.

If these retards could do it, never fear!

In two short weeks, I too would rise above.

*But never dared consider if I should.*

i wonder if NIO will even see much pullback cuz of election

I would expect them to moon before next earnings and possibly this holiday season. A shit ton of people have been waiting for Zen3 and RDNA2 and it's literally about to start shipping.

Hold and trust in Lisa Su. She knows what she is doing
I quit the banking industry, that's how I manage.

My buddy at TRP gave up on trading because of it.

Yea...  it‚Äôs totally okay man we aren‚Äôt gonna make you take any meds but we‚Äôll be sending you the short bus from now on
the only red I'm betting on is SPY 11/6 $320p
hold I think
It's literally just a curfew between 10pm and 5am.
Just hoping for 2-3 points from NIO tmr so I can get out from these calls.  No hope for CRSR might as well hold through earnings now.

Time for what?

To drop them....I mean how low can they really go at this point.
I feel like prop 22 is priced in since there's a lot of certainty it will pass. Might drop a bit more in the coming days but who knows
** lose money lol
Because Tim AAPL is gay.
holy shit comment volume is so low in these threads now
Get a koozie
Yeah I am in a similar boat with Apha, thought you had said sold some puts as well though.  The calls are far less risky for reasons you just outlined.

Yeah, I'm not really worried if my $20 250p expires worthless. My 12/31's feel pretty safe at the moment. I'll take profits on those this week assuming SPY stays flat or continues to drop throughout the week. If SPY skyrockets I'll look to sell if my gains are erased and I end up back at my entry price.

No one is going to movies any time soon and lockdowns look to be possible.  Their only viable source of capital is cheap equity at this point.  Even with a vaccine theaters will be slow to fill up.  They have to be a strong candidate for bankruptcy in the next few months, but hey, that might be bullish.

That's the bear case anyway, but I hear you.  But any play would need to be pretty long term.

There will always be big market moves in either direction to make a killing off of, it‚Äôs literally endless. Stop thinking of it like it was your one chance that you missed, because there are actually things in life that you only get one shot at, but making a good trade in the stock market isn‚Äôt one of them.

Not necessarily.  If biden wins and there is a red senate, stimulus talks will probably have to wait all the way until Feb or March after inauguration. Then biden has to punch it out with a hostile senate who'll dig in their heels. By the time all of that is done, the GOP senate might just say no stimulus because it'll bail out blue states and it'll be spring by then, plus there may be vaccine data as well.

It‚Äôs not that hard to understand. 3 sigma drop last week priced in worst case scenario. Market realizing it‚Äôs not the end of the world and buying the fucking dip.
[removed]
I have CRON, and I sold the covered calls for $6 strike and my cost basis was only $5.55 so I'll make 45 cents per share if I get assigned, which is not bad in my opinion. Or I don't get assigned and I get to keep the premium and the shares. Either way I'm happy.

Oh... 

Apple are using their own chips from their phones for their next computers. They've always use AMD graphics for like the last 10 years. It'd be great if they used nvida for the cuda + their own cpu. But that's nto what you're saying
it's not a lotto, it's a fact!
probably scared for their calls
Have you looked into all of those..? Because I think you‚Äôll be disappointed
People buying calls rn - why?
No, I shoulda googled though, ty for the link.

I just didn't realize buybacks went that big.  $1B seems a bit surreal to me, but I guess it's more common than I thought.

Why are we in the "moves tomorrow" thread??? Time travel? Did the market close?
yeah you may be right. I'm just trying to figure out why there are so many calls expiring from 11/20 and after on NVDA and puts on AMD from 11/20 and after. AAPL just announced that they won't be using INTC chips so INTC is completely out of the picture for now. it's either AMD or NVDA, and I think option flows explain NVDA will get the deal imo but let's see! good luck to both of us

3) trump win/blue senate

are all possibilities that each have significantly different impacts on the economy.  and if the elections are close it means an added layer of uncertainty since it'll be contested.  there is nothing priced in atm. then we still have corona virus in the background raging out of control.  pfizer and moderna are supposed to report results in Nov.

SHANGHAI, China, Nov. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NIO Inc. ("NIO" or the "Company") (NYSE:NIO), a pioneer in China's premium smart electric vehicle market, today announced that it will report its third quarter 2020 unaudited financial results on Tuesday, November 17, 2020, after the close of the U.S. markets.

The Company's management will host an earnings conference call at 7:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time on November 17, 2020 (8:00 AM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on November 18, 2020).

**NIO EARNINGS ON THE 17th AFTER HOURS**

EDIT: I meant sell my calls, not sell calls to clarify
Worth it
You bought them expecting a certain election result, hold them.

Besides today‚Äôs volume seem to indicate insider buying from people who know the partial results from mail-ins votes.
Probably am going to buy NIO again at 32 and whatever it drops to tomorrow
We‚Äôre waiting till Friday before doing that.

Instead of just selling a 185 put on tdoc, I sell a 185 put and buy a 180 put at the same time, for the same expiration. Because it's only $5 wide, it only uses $500 of my buying power. As long as TDOC closes above 185 by expiration, I make max profit. If TDOC is below 185, then I can roll out the position to a later date, and receive more premium to do it.

Edit: every position I posted is already profitable right now, one day later

I think it's time to start going long again. Is COVID getting better? No. Are economies struggling? Yes. Are we in a recession? Yes.

All reasons for the market to go up, since it never does what the normie average fucks all think it should do.

Reason #2 is related to the above. All of WSB is now bearish. You can see it in the DDs. We saw the return of the retarded 5 paragraph GEX DIX LULZ bullshit bear porns over the weekend. Daily thread is cluttered with SeConD LeG dOwN downies. 

It's time to go long and defy odds and print cash while all the normies stay cash or worse, short. Yeah that makes sense on paper but in case your newbie ass hasnt learned yet, the market doesnt do what "makes sense".

I use the unusual_whale app. Popped up there. It was right when that first candle hit. Not sure if they posted it to Twitter yet.
This is literally what I do, I buy 500 tsla and sell it same moment as I buy it at like 0.1 profit, lol
Oh that! Wait what is the name of the dbz guy? Is it not tianeman as well?

SOL
Hmmmm
It's a horribly run company that has fucked over investors repeatedly, but it's pretty heavily shorted and has a pretty significant catalyst coming up, even if the US markets aren't a massive demand surge for Canada weed.

Already took profit upwards of 400% and put it in some tech calls for a month or two out.

SPY chart today shows it going up to just shy of 333, then dropping to near 327.

First and 10, VIX rolls to his right, he's chased back to the left, makes a man miss and runs out of room and he's sacked!
Yup
No one is buying these garbage options. Only fools.
JKS, SWBI, ACB anything worth getting for tomorrow?
Lol somebody forgot to turn back 1 hour
Incoming rug pull last 10 minute of the market. Also af futures will be 2.9 negative. Spy will open at 320 and dump to 306 within 5 minutes of the bell. Circuit breakers will kick in and then another sell off to 280z Screen shot this and put it on your fridge
wtf BABA up almost 2% and calls are still red. Can't win
Snap volume has dropped off but still stuck around 40$. Fucking dump it
Many (well-off) people are saving money more than ever. At the same time, there's never been so many people unemployed and poorer than ever before.


The economy is like Riley Reids asshole it just keeps getting wider and wider. When shit builds up it's just gonna crash uncontrollably.

Fuck do I hold my CGC $21c for 11/20 or sell before election?
Looks like NIO setting up nicely for another 5% overnight move
Strength of market today is pricing in a Biden win? Or nah? I think so...so if ü•≠ü•≠ man has any chance of winning Tues night the market will dump by Wed. IMHO

I just realized that in one month NIO is up 50%. Just crazy. God damn my paper hands.
And the price immediately sinks after
Major SELLOFF
Did you forget to reset your clock?
It‚Äôs projection
Bought 0dte SPY 330c for $0.25 and sold it for $0.85. It‚Äôs an achievement nowadays. üòÇüòÇ
lol no one is buying those. Check the bid/ask spread.
It‚Äôs a good investment even if held for only 3 months
What caused tech to tank today relative to other indices?
Even if you get the earnings result correct and the direction of the earnings stocks correct, is there a high risk that the market tomorrow can literally bring down everything?
Everyone must be eating mac & cheese, KHC mooning
Thinking calls too..
Shut your whore mouth
So I‚Äôm guessing we not dumping ?
NIO
So here it is, fourth and five with the game on the line deep in their own territory, Michael VIX alone in the backfield, he's gonna take the snap and cut back to his left and there's a lane, just enough for the first down and the bears stay in this game!
Ya I was being sarcastic on the original post lol 

You are exactly right. Fear is the greatest manipulator no doubt
Will all stock options get IV crush?
[deleted]
Rich people that buy and pump stocks couldn't give two monkey craps about the state of the economy, so they will continue buying and pumping regardless of whatever happens in the real world. Stonks are literally free money as long as you have a long term horizon (at least a month or more).
Today is the last day for rocket ships. Tomorrow will be flat. Wednesday will be the end. 

Think about it. It‚Äôs the storyline. ‚ÄúTrump has done so much for the economy. Look how awesome the markets performed. Then Biden won and everything went to shit.‚Äù

The next two months will be all of the heavys unwinding their shit before Biden comes in and then, who knows. But, I think this manipulation will be over after Biden wins tomorrow. 

At least, that‚Äôs how I plan on losing all my money this time.
SPY $250 Put??? Why?
So we're pricing in federal legalization? Soooo..... It's priced in...... I'm gonna light up walking down the road at close!!!

Amazon below $3000 is such a good investment for 1-5 years later on
is the market saying that amazon cant stay under 3k? or can we get a fat drop tomorrow when election is contested
Not high enough
This was a bear trap, playing a bear trap, disguised as another bear trap
LOL, the 20dte OTM calls I bought at the bottom are worth less now after the bounce cause the IV is dropping faster than the price is rising. IV is going to make playing this market a bitch
Apple's November 10th announcement is titled "one more thing..." which if you're not a big apple nerd, they ONLY use for announcing new product lines. Whatever it is, it's significantly new, not just updates. This might be where they show off the glasses for the first time.

Im not losing money. I bought puts at 10AM.

And even if I were, that wouldn't be why this is manipulation.

Honestly, the people who cry "manipulation" every time the market moves are obnoxious conspiracy theorists. But the people who act like manipulation doesn't exist in the market, and it never happens, are even more delusional.

can't tell if serious or not, but...

The term black swan was used by Taleb because, in the origin story, literally everyone in the West for all of history (UK in particular) had only ever seen white swans. There had never been a black swan in their lives, ever, so why would they even comprehend that that option / outcome existed. All of sudden, when they start exploring Australia (iirc), the explorers happen upon a flock of black colored swans. It made headlines back home as an example of the contrast / stark differences between home and this new land.

This was an event that was completely unpredictable to the point that it wasn't even considered a possibility. 

So, for this OP chump to imply that one of the two contenders in the presidential election victory is a black swan is just laughably stupid and entirely fitting for the IQ / EDU of this subreddit.

Shit now I'm the idiot lol. I guess I did question how the fuck is hyllion that low. Yea quick math you are right.
Lol. If we go to a lock down under Biden and a Democratic senate then there will be monthly stimulus payments. So who gives a rat f*ck if we get locked down. It only matters when the government doesn‚Äôt help us and forces us to stay home with out income.
super weird price action
Mask mandate but no lockdown
Weed calls and shares up nicely tho

Automod didn't roll back it's clock lol
Agreed. A steady climb with decent jumps from news, ERs is more rational. It's still up 8% today and slowly climbing but after the morning dip bears claimed "the scams over!" haha.. Nonetheless it would've been nice to see another 15% day, but you're right it crashes to consolidate.

Ban ban fucking ban
Just sell a call/put under the strike price you currently have to lock in gains. It‚Äôs writing options and doesn‚Äôt use a PDT. You sell the cheaper option below yours because if you go with the one right above it will use collateral to cover the difference. You‚Äôre welcome.

Example: I have a $140c BA and I‚Äôm up $1000. Sell as many of those calls at $141 strike price so now you‚Äôre only risking $100 rather than the total $1000. Then you just buy back the credit you sold the next day after selling the options you actually own.

Anyone actually think Trump will concede if he loses? And if he refuses to, how will the market react?
Good, so the puts I sold to open on Apple at $105 will make money as they try to pump the stock back up to $115-120.  

- ThetaGang.


when you sell puts at $105, you make money if Apple is not below $105 on the expiration date as your option expires worthless.
$329.50 is the new floor.

no, and you embarrass yourself by misapplying this concept

Eh... If u sell a put contract (100 shares)....

On the expiration date of that contract, if the stock closes below the strike price you choose...you will be assigned the contract. You keep the premium. So... You buy the stock at discount...

If it plunges 30% ur fucked(unless the premium u got paid offsets this loss, which I doubt)... If it goes up 30% you only get to keep the premium bc it's not ur stock. So you have a maximum profit...but technically an unlimited risk of the stock plummets to $0

Selling puts is recommended if you plan to purchase a stock anyway...

As well as the TV remote
They already dropped down to this level like 3 times since the split 2 months ago. Figured the third time hitting this level they'd have a decent chance of bouncing off, coupled with mango getting flushed and his hard on for going after tech on Twitter being a potential non factor soon.

Yep. The chance we have a clear Biden win tomorrow is like 10% even if he eventually is president. Crimson red for the next 2 weeks. I think the contested 2000 election dropped 20%

Man, if you‚Äôre getting directional lately, you‚Äôre not even gambling, but just asking for it. Even roulette with 0,00 gives u 47.4%. Options are just that. Directional is great, at times. When in doubt, strangle it up for some premium.

ACB. It‚Äôs cheap as hell to play. Just do a 4.5 or 5 call
I really upset my roommate because I said "let me do you a favor" and peeled off the film that had been on his macbook for a year.

It was peeling up on the corners and looks terrible. He's welcome.
Holding ACB through earnings next week is degenerate gambling at its finest or worst depending on perspective.  Especially if it pumps hard off election results.
You pick the strike and expiration. You put up cash to make the purchase. If the stock closes below your strike price at expiration you will have to buy the stock. If it closes above then you do not buy the stock. Either way you keep the premium

Nah we're safe. 

We don't spend money on options. We gamble.
lmao, so true
Would it be illegal for me to use two accounts to buy options. One to severely under bid to widen bid /ask and then use the other account to purchase at the lower midpoint I artificially created. also the inverse, put an ask out for higher than I‚Äôm looking to sell it for so I can raise the sell point as well?

SHORT THE PUMP

no not that one, the other one

No no the next one
I work for a major partner of Zoom. Before the pandemic I thought they were a nice $60-120 stock. I kicked myself for not buying it at $64 in November of last year for a long time (more so now). They are not worth close to what they are. They have a decent story and have carved out a nice market share, but they are so overvalued in a market with so much competition. They have benefited greatly from the pandemic.
Literally think SPY will have another parabolic ending, FUCK SPY
Sold some stuff and was thinking of buying tech dip
Fair civil war is dramatic, civil unrest is more accurate. Closing major cities right now would spook the market for sure
Nio stox
Kicking them out would not be lucrative at all my guy, write up a contract where the little shit has to cut you in at a rate increasing in accordance with their monthly OF income.
MA and MI both implementing stronger virus measures/curfews. Yup this thing is gonna tank when all the other blue states follow after Tuesday.
I am being sarcastic, it is very much priced in, I bought under 20 though so idc
NIO solidified itself as the next big thing in EV next to Tesla.  People loading up on leaps/shares at this price gonna be filthy wealthy.

Buy calls when ‚Äúbears r so fuk‚Äù comments get downvoted hard
$23, so not great, but ain't terrible comparing to people who bought at $40-50, I'm afraid of selling calls on it too cuz you never know when this thing explodes.

Dude most trades are done by algos. Don't focus too much on day-to-day or minute by minute price actions because those are all done by computers. Focus on the long term macro picture and form a comprehensive trading strategy or position around that.

You need to call customer service at the stock market. Keep demanding to talk to a supervisor until you get someone who can reverse the transaction. It helps to threaten a negative Yelp review.

Another thing to analyze are the Ferguson and I believe another city riots that happened under Obama. If I remember correctly those also caused shortages and price increase for ammo and firearms.

Still the largest driver this year has been COVID-19 and that was even more amplified by the riots beginning with Minneapolis and continuing to this day to some degree.
weed stocks were the clear winner today
Could see Aapl getting there but not anytime soon
Never again
Lmaoo this pump tho. I hope nobody is dropping all their money on calls. When this comes back down it‚Äôll get ugly
lol
It‚Äôs fucking shocking to me there r ppl on this board that think the rest of this week is gonna be smooth w no civil unrest lmao

Altho tbh i‚Äôm not sure the market is gonna give a damn abt civil unrest, i think any downpressure rn is just a lack of buyers waiting to speculate on next leg of econ once election results somewhat clear
Investors are scared of Biden regulating the monopoly.
tech got a bump time for a bloody week
why is it strange to you guys we are melting up on clearer evidence of a non-contested election?  Sometimes you just need to get out of your own way and stop hoping for bearish conditions to appear just because tmr is the election.  It's been priced in that it would be contested and now it's looking less likely hence the slow melt up.

Could still sell off EOD on profit taking so diamond hand those puts.
This sub is always late 1 week. We gonna gap up this week and everyone gonna buy calls then we gap down next week.
I need to get drunk and start watching cramer again. Agree huge likelihood of contest/volatility. Donny isn't going down without a fight

Whales have a target they‚Äôre trying to reach before dropping the bags. You can literally see them pump XLF and then just stop all of a sudden when they‚Äôre done. The more qqq contributes to the rally, the less they pump xlf or xlv. Like clockwork.

I had stock in weed months ago...people spending more at home smoking weed to escape depression...stocks went lower. I like the idea of having weed stock, BUT every study I've read about the switch from illegal to legal shows a decline in the amount of weed smoked. I dont doubt that a dem controlled gov will  reschedule weed which will result in higher stock prices...but all that is gonna happen well after Jan 20th. Its best to wait till after the 1st of the year to seriously look at weed stocks
I did that in a week
what if they leak election results tonight üò≥

If there's one thing I've learned from scalping puts the past few days, just set your limit price and don't touch it after. Don't try to get greedy and continuously adjust you sell price as you see the stock change. It's not worth all your gains for that extra 5%

It varies from state to state, some have started already with "early voting". A few states have early voting turnout exceeding the entire vote turnout for 2016. Some states such as Arizona are notoriously slow in counting their votes and they are also in a "later" timezone. It really isn't very likely that we will know the preliminary results until Wednesday, and that's only if there aren't equipment problems, counting problems, missing ballots, and other stupid BS that seems to plague our US voting process for two decades now.
there is an open interest of 114000 for 11/20 spy 310p

Morning Star because its the only Marijuana stock that has 1 billion dollars cash which it got from Marlboro's Acquisition. It was also one of the only Marijuana companies that didn't buy a bunch of companies at a ridiculous price in 2018/2019. Its the only one that can still be a strong contender even if Marijuana doesn't pick up for another 8-10 years. Already generates around 40M in revenue and has market cap of 2 Billion (more than most Marijuana stocks on the market). So 6.50 is a proper evaluation, it's currently undervalued and will probably only be this way until Wednesday.

Also dont forget Elizabeth Warren could legitimately be treasury secretary. Anyone want to hazard a guess how her financial policy would affect markets? And Bidens tax plan to raise capital gains, even tho likely not in effect until 22, do you think huge asset managers hold till January 1st 2021 and hope it does not kick in till 2022? If Trump wins and red sweep you could see no stimmy. Literally no short term win for markets. Long term it doesn't matter whos in office just allocate to the sectors they favor

>Trying to push federal laws onto states over gun control is about the most politically suicidal thing you can do in this country.

Yet here we are. They're pretty open about their gun control plan and they think the time is right to finally push it through. Maybe the millions of new gun owners from the recent panic buying might see the light and tell them to slow down, but I'll believe it when I see it. 

Maybe they're all talk... But I'm in California and I got a taste of Kamila Harris's love of gun control with that whole handgun roster + microstamping silliness in addition to all the other stuff that they'd love to introduce to everyone.

You may want to double check that.  From the article I linked above:

"A trader must make the mark-to-market election by the original due date (not including extensions) of the tax return for the year prior to the year for which the election becomes effective."

That's straight from the IRS.  Accountants make mistakes all the time.  It sounds like your accountant thinks that the election must be made by the due date for the taxes including extensions (which is Oct 15).   But the IRS pub specifically says "not including extensions" which would make it Apr 15 (or possibly July 15 this year; I'm not sure if that covid thing counted as an extension or a new "original" date).

At the very least I'd send your accountant that link and ask them about the discrepancy.

Akin to saying "It can't be that easy to expect inside-exercise bike Peloton to moon during a pandemic". Or "It can't be that easy to expect tech to moon during a pandemic". Or "It can't be that easy to have a bull market while the Fed pumped trillions monthly". Or "It can't be that easy for Lowe's to moon on DIY during lockdown". While WSB over-complicates & is reactionary on the day-to-day, a lot of the good plays have been fairly common sense (if inflated by the money-printer). It is fairly common sense that the market will moon on a consensus government & stimulus bill; it is fairly common sense the market fill flail on a contested election. No "It can't be that easy" about it.

Fuck my life in to pieces, this is my last resort
Puts woulda printed
They're not really pumping a stock, all of China's EV stocks are going up because the government has a goal of putting more electric vehicles on the road so China becomes a leader in EVs. The way they are doing that is by restricting vehicle registrations for gas powered cars, but if you get an EV instead its easier to get a license. They're kind of pumping the whole industry which is why XPENG and LI Auto are also going up.

By the way Tesla also sells cars in China which is why Tesla has also benefited from this. Though I think Tesla shot up too much too so its going through a correction.
Uh my shit is officially weekly now

The market is in a long term uptrend and looking at past elections in this situation the market goes back up 90% of the time. Interest rates are still 0% so a lot of big players will be investing at these low prices. Also technically the candlesticks are forming long shadows indicating the selloff is losing steam. Follow my advice at your own risk but I'd say in the next 30 days the market has a 90% chance of going higher.

Here‚Äôs to hoping I get some of this back in the green.
This sell-off has been very orderly. Nobody is panicking to get out which indicates that it is a broad rotation and risk-off exercise leading up to the election.

The million-dollar question is .... "has everyone positioned correctly and ready to move it lower?"

Also, I am in the camp of a post-election rally but that is what everyone is expecting. That can only mean that it will not happen.  It can't be that easy.

I raised cash today because I was fully invested and I want to have some dry powder should the market go lower.

Look at the 3 month graph for Biden's odds here and then compare it to the 3 month graph of SPY: https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698

The high vol days for the election were flat for SPY and the high vol days for SPY were flat for the election. Basically, the market and election result are uncorrelated.

The email is a courtesy email. If you are a highly valued client, you may even get a phone call. The truth is, they will be selling you out in the next 24 hours if you don't deposit more money or take care of the problem yourself.

Also, you have no way to control what they sell and they have a right to sell anything... oh yeah, and they don't have to wait. They actually have the right to sell whatever they want, as soon as your account goes into margin call status.

TSLA is my barometer for the market‚Äôs appetite for risk. 

Up 2.2% today
They reported strong October Sales
Yep, but won't do yours.. sorry.
probably should stop out of your puts now.  it's not going to finish below where we were 20 minutes ago.
What if I'm just here to confirm my DD is contradicting the majority of the sub?
True, just wish I was free to open/close my trades when I want

Can‚Äôt believe I actually sold my spy put for a profit. 4$ but heyü§ó
So glad I learned this lesson before this week. Monday green was very predictable. Tuesday will spike then begin to fall mid day into  Wednesday.
After a huge sell-off? It's quite likely. Democratic win means bigger than expected stimulus. Republican win means nothing changes, same status quo, markets rally because uncertainty is gone. Win win either way.
Yes. Doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt work though.
And anyone who bought the calls right before close Friday got to profit too.

A rare day where bulls and bears print (or both lose depending on how you see it)
What are Biden stocks?
just use a strategy that doesnt use up a day trade and save them for emergency exits

 Deez Nuts was a satirical presidential candidate, portrayed by Brady C. Olson (born 1999/2000 (age 20‚Äì21), who ran in the 2016 United States presidential election. His form to run for office was filed with the Federal Election Commission in late July 2015.

spy 0dte 330c are only .38....   just in case it goes full retard like it did friday.
Hey man, just a random wsb autist stopping by. Chinese sector is truly amazing at times. I too once rode to the moon with a company called LK.

Just open up a new brokerage account somewhere else.

never the wrong time to buy calls brother
Absolutely the opposite. I don't like Trump but he'd make the market go up for a good week-month while a biden win will make it tank even more and will begin climbing up after 2 months when new and more stimulus talk happens. The market is dependent and wanting Trump to win
[deleted]
196 then 192 but 199-200 is a fort right now.

In my opinion (which has been wrong for months now so you might want to inverse me lol) I think tomorrow VXX will peak because of election night so I‚Äôm holding.
Find cheap straddles before markets close tomorrow. Sell them when the election is still not called and/or Trump goes nuts on Wednesday or Thursday
Im also Dutch and for me withdrawals take like a bit longer than 24h, within a day i get the e-mail that the  payment is being processed and then its always in my bank account the next day.
Is there any reason for NIO spike or is it just retarded Chinese steroids?

Spy earnings tomorrow night bro
I would think so, unless we need to kick Russias ass?
I‚Äôm selling my puts EOD. If this gaps up tomorrow, puts are completely wrecked with how this has been going today.
What ?
OH JESUS NO TURBOPUMP
So fucking glad I sold my amazon in the green beginning of day
Buying leaps on GOLD calls once the inevitable selloff occurs after election night

Let‚Äôs knock msft down under 200
Yeah I‚Äôm glad I live in a small city but I guess you never know with the crazies.
Yeah buddy. I have 12/18 92.5c's I bought before the earnings announcement. Thought it was going to the fucking moon. And maybe it should be - but the people making the market don't give a fuck about or understand how AMD is actively fucking up everyone else with their good G/CPU's. 

Recover what you can. I think they're undervalued right now and in a week or two they'll stabilize at something a little higher and I'm going to exit and recover what I can. Better to lose 60% than to lose 100%.

I think it's less about news and more about price here. XOM returned to their Covid crash price just last week so it's hard to imagine there is more downside for this stock. Bough January ITM calls last week that will probably see consistent growth for the next month or so.

Everything i tried to play today turned red instantly üò≠
Healthcare sector is honestly pretty flat compared to tech if the narrative really is political uncertainty. XLV was dumping last week.
good advice, am 70% down on aapl calls am kind of making peace with literally exiting at 80% or even 90% on the off chance that it bounces a bit back up
On average they prob will go on as normal, but some sectors won't, or regions. I expect chinese stocks to drop with trump and oil stocks to drop with biden
It didn‚Äôt go below 196 in September
Biggest bear trap of the year today. ü§° üêª

I think he'll step down. My concern is if Biden refuses to concede.

Not straight up civil war, but uncertainty around who "really won" and various groups deciding their side was robbed and they hit the streets. We're not talking a true civil war 2, but it could be a destabilizing time that adds a shit ton of uncertainty to the market.

Most instant deposit trading at other brokers is limited to stock/options. Have yet to find one that allows it besides RH. TD, Webull, IB, and Tasty do not allow it. At least with TD you only have to wait 1 day before you can trade options.

I'm a big lefty, but I'll be honest with you. The most likely civil war scenario is if Donnie wins but it's due to some bullshit like throwing out votes on a technicality or something. The riots from this summer will look cute in comparison.

That sounds about right, there were even small riots when Trump won the first time too, so definitely feel like that would happen.

Just feels like Trump not stepping down stuff is overblown, though i could see things being contested just not like some civil war whatever people are talking about.

tbf, most things in the economy is prolonging the inevitable. And if you manage to prolong for long enough, the effect was spread so thin it's barely felt.

Maybe we are going towards another great crash. But i don't mind the fuckers on top temporizing the problem over as long as they can. 

Most people can take gradual decline. It's the sharp turns you want to avoid.

What's even the point of obsessing over charts and day trading when long-term TQQQ has gone up by 437% since 2017?
How the fuck do you guys trade this shit? You literally just buy calls at open then sell before noon to lock profits? There is no long term options the last 6 weeks.
Won‚Äôt happen. Some really do abide by the rule of law and others riot in the street and loot.
Took the gains on AAPL puts expiring Friday. Will I regret it?
That would be awesome. I have 50k I wanna buy and hold with but I was thinking amazon msft or apple.
Doubtful. If you think covid is a Dem tool to force in Biden then why are European countries also locking down? Especially conservative run ones?

Yeah
Can someone explain the risks of a wide bull put spread?

Looking at cop 28/33
Theory : AMZN is looking like the market is pricing in a Biden victory with the expectation that by simply acknowledging coronavirus still exists, there will be actions to curb the damage and reduce the future growth of Amazon under a Biden administration.

Conclusion : AMZN is on a temporary sale today / tomorrow until Trump wins. 

Please tell me why I am a stupid.

Wtf was it like that one month off? sounds heavenly
So the robinhood thing was obv a joke. I‚Äôve only traded $SPY on it a few times and it‚Äôs slow for that. 

Tech Review: 

I use it mainly to set timers when cooking, to check inside, and watch YouTube videos of recipes. Between my whole family and I, we probably use the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features of the fridge a few times a week. My mom likes it for checking the weather without using her iPad or the Alexa. 


Hardware:

Decent storage space. Have had it for a year and 0 issues with the ice dispenser. You get a pretty solid cheese drawer, produce drawers, and shelf space. It‚Äôs annoying when storing gallons of milk at times since the side shelves are kind of thin. If you want pictures of the inside let me know and you can get a feel for how things fit.
Take the wins where you can get em....
We are going red this week no way if ü•≠wins democrats let the election go uncontested. Cities will be burning down some are already boarding up shops. Red week

Too much uncertainty has led to sell off. Landslide will clear a massive chunk of uncertainty. A trifecta of House of Reps, Senate, plus Presidency will moonshot stocks in 2021

my ex put me on some dem list.  getting wall to wall texts. bitch
Tech is massively and ridiculously overpriced, fundamentals don't matter ...until they do.
Sell before Friday. I'd sell as SPY begins to test $320 (or little higher than that). If it breaks past $320 you will lost out on some money, but you still turned a profit.
Was that for your fridge monitor?

More stocks traders are communists then you think. Your fantasy is that people dive head-first into this casino, see how much of a game of chance it is, how the entire market is built on a survival of the fittest casino system that benefits the very few and still come out as a die-hard capitalist.

Trading stocks was one of the many building blocks that showed me this system is a scam. Might as well play along with it.

Pricing in Biden win. Dems are harder on tech and tech is still way overvalued compared to other indices. Small caps and Dow get a lot of boost from a dem stimulus package so they are holding up stronger.
I‚Äôm saying if you‚Äôre buying now you‚Äôre an idiot people been buying since last month for the run up if Biden wins which it‚Äôs proven he won‚Äôt.
And just like that VIX positive again

REGI went over budget on their latest upgrade project. This quarters earnings may not hit the mark. However with their new capacity to reuse material due to a cleaner distillation process their following earnings should beat the mark.

You guys ever notice how food companies will call shit like "restaurant style" to make it sound fancier? I just saw a commercial for mayonnaise where they were like "craving that restaurant flavor? Try this fucking mayonnaise."

you know if Orange Man doesn't win by a landslide he's going to get up on the balcony of the White House and give double birds to the country on live TV.

Green on 8 of the previous 10 elections then generally some selling in the week and month that follows.  If you believe this election is not like the other girls, it might make sense to wait it out. 

I have not added to any positions today, but I've not sold either and I may pick up some on this afternoon dip.

Why did it just decide to start drilling? Lol and why is tech dying when covid is increasing and more lockdowns ? I‚Äôm in tech puts but, wtf? Like damn. 


This is mostly due to election I‚Äôm assuming. Market gives no fuck about covid it seems because tech wouldn‚Äôt be selling off like this.

I had people shitting on me for saying it was set for a run at 18$ a share. If you are confident then do what you think is best. Don't let some fucking sit on the sidelines cheerleader tell you what to do.
How many red days in a row will this be for SPY
What do you mean by the bp?  If you sold a call credit spread and both legs are expiring worthless today, then it's a non-event and whatever cash collateral you had locked down would just be released when they expired.  I may not be understanding your question correctly.
I have SPY 330p expring Friday, I was thinking to sell when SPY hits 323. 

&#x200B;

Or hold till Friday?
Maybe start with cash secured puts this week? What if spy tanks to 320 or further? You‚Äôd probably be able to collect decent premium during this volatility and wouldn‚Äôt have to sit on potentially buying high

Completely legal-ish depending on how good of a job whomever is investigating you does with the audit.  

This is a white collar crime at best, and even then, most crimes like this have to be proven that you actually had intent to defraud someone.  So, quite literally pleading stupidity is the best way to get out of it, and then unless they can prove that you knew what you were doing was illegal/fraudulent to the standard of "proof beyond a reasonable doubt"  which is basically 100%


Which is why "100k loan to pay off 100k student debt" is easy as A ---> B.  If you bought a house with 90k then put 10k to debt it might be looked at, it might not.  If i bought a car, a house, a boat, personal loan for construction, throw your legitimate income in there, take out some cash on your CC then deposit cash a few weeks later in an off amount.  Throw some money in a stock account, and take it out, and stuff, it -could- be proven Completely and exactly how it all went down, but the odds are no one will care enough to look into every transaction from last year, where it went, separating legit money from loan money, over several transactions and so forth.  Itll be chalked up to "this guy is shit with finances" and then theyll take what they can.

Ultimately, it won't even be deemed illegal, they just won't let you file bankruptcy on it.  Theyll say "you cannot file bankruptcy on these loans: x y z.  

Odds are, no one will file charges on it because that standard of proof in criminal cases is much higher than civil (51% vs 100%) so just because civil says "fraud" doesn't mean criminal = fraud.  Which, it might not even be fraud in the criminal sense if its fraud in the case of bankruptcy.  Its totally different things.  The most likely outcome should things turn poorly is they say you can't file bankruptcy on it, and you get in a really bad situation until you default and so forth. Which, even then, i find this unlikely.  

I don't know much about bankruptcy to say the details, but im pretty sure its all legal-ish

What was the job? And how much do you make now if you dont mind me asking?
High six figures like 600-900k?
Finally 328 smd
Now this is pod racing
Nice try, but the IRS is smarter than that.

The mark to market election has to be made with your taxes for the previous tax year, timely, not including extensions.

Also they have to consider you a trader (not an investor) to do this, and to be a trader the amounts you are trading need to be "substantial".  No guidance given but I'm guessing that the $50/week you are saving from taxes ($70 if you include the money you make behind the Wendy's) doesn't qualify you.

To quote the IRS (https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc429):  "It doesn't matter whether you call yourself a trader or a day trader, you're an investor".  Fucking harsh.

Was thinking of getting 100 shares for the inevitable election dump, and then just selling a covered call on it for each expiration. in the week. Can net about $400 a week about just on premium, and If I get assigned, just sell a put as SPY will always inevitably go up

I think 100$ wasn't an educated assessment on your part.
Little too high. shoulda went with 85 or 90.

more reasonable  and you would still have a shot from Christmas/ black Friday gains.
What should I buy on Amazon?
Republicans only know how to use social media bots the Russians gave them
Psh I‚Äôm at 9.5k
IV will destroy you both ways.
We are very close I would imagine. I already have all my shares from long ago otherwise I would buy here. There is limited downside now and it is Amazon, if your gonna have to bag hold any company this is it lol. 1 or 2 years from now this dip will be long forgotten.
I am only guessing it is pricing in a Biden victory that would help shorten the COVID time frame by acknowledging it still exists? Don't think Biden is going to win, unfortunately. Buying opportunity?
Just declined a high six figure job because it would require me to do actual work

Any other time SPY drops $4, puts up 100%.

Today, puts up 14%. Lol mfers selling puts banking off them premiums. That‚Äôs what Pete Narjarian said he was doing last week.
Yeah - I really don‚Äôt get why he wouldn‚Äôt sell off half when it was $15. That was just an absurd run and would have locked in $1m
U have a target price? 25/27? Think it could short squeeze pump another 25%+

PSTH is good but you may wait for next year before it moon since no one know when they found a target.
Yes, NIO, perfect time to buy in! Only up 2000%. I still remember autists here negging me when i wanted to buy in at $4 and now they're going all in at the top.
95 is my price target. That is where it legitimately should be in a normal market without all this bizzarro dip buying


If it gets to 95, I'm going balls deep. If not, I ain't an apple investor.

The federal gov has hardly done anything to force any states to do much when it comes to gun control. In Missouri and other states, you don't need to register firearms, and you don't even need a permit to concealed carry in Missouri at least. 

Trying to push federal laws onto states over gun control is about the most politically suicidal thing you can do in this country.

SPY implied volatility for this week is 53% versus TSLA's 78%. This is the first time the two are so close. Normally SPY's would be in 20s and TSLA's would be in 60s.

Yes, but Tesla has never been high whereas this stock has had 3x the price it has now, so that's another story.

Also by take off I didn't mean that it will be worth 90$ in 3 months, but 45-50 in 2-3 months is probable.

In Twitter the sentiment looks NO but some people are saying  polls are 46(yes)/42(No). Any idea what‚Äôs the real sentiment on the ground.
Posted about REGI before and they‚Äôve more than doubled in price since I bought shares in May. They benefit hugely from legislation that took effect the end of last year that gives tax incentives per barrel of natural gas produced. That legislation isn‚Äôt set to expire until the end of 2022 so I don‚Äôt intend to do anything with them for at least another year.

The big deal is that part of that Biden gain is in Pennsylvania, which was looking close. If Biden can't lock in Pennsylvania that changes a lot of things. So the confidence interval has moved significantly for Biden with this morning's polls.

The real-economy stock market wants Biden to win and takes off whenever it looks as if he will.

But, don't listen to me. Because upvotes can always be redeemed for Robinhood $$

Given this info, thinking about a strangle with long VXX call @ 30 and long VXX put @ 25.

The idea is to capture up & down or down & up. Thoughts?

Ha... Thinking of doing the same on Tuesday, if we get a run-up before the Market closes on Tuesday, I'll probably close up to half my positions and open some Puts. The risk of Biden winning huge enough where Mango can't "reasonably" contest the results is still good, and the Markets could go stratospheric... Of course, I wouldn't fully bet on things being wrapped up in a tidy bow by midnight on Tuesday.
I think the safest bet is to go all in on SQQQ $35c expiring this Friday

Say you think SPY will close below 330 by Friday, but not any lower than 325. You buy a 330 put and sell a 325 put. You have a fixed maximum profit. Just need to close out before it expires to avoid pin risk.

India and China will lead continued and significant demand growth for crude and LNG.

A really good fridge- like really good shoes and a really good bed- is just one of those things that is worth the money.

The poors will never understand but who cares? That's why they're the poors. Enjoy your rusted 19 year old Kenmore, poors... When I open the door on my really good fridge, reaching for tendies is a literal ***experience*** going inside that fucking thing.
First step would be applying to LO jobs online. You can go with either a bank or a mortgage broker/direct lender. If you go with a bank you don‚Äôt have to take the nmls test, however your comp might not be as nice. If you go with a broker you wont have much of a base and you‚Äôll have to take the nmls test but the bonuses are insane. You also can‚Äôt have a recent bankruptcy on your record. I‚Äôd just check LinkedIn and start applying
ALGN doesn't care.

Yeah it‚Äôs definitely our best way of reaching people your age aside from Instagram. Twitter is really only good for ‚Äúbrand advertising‚Äù aka if you are okay with paying premiums for intangible brand value (aka eyes, but not direct sales.) long term I‚Äôd bet on Snapchat over Twitter, but weekly or monthly obviously it‚Äôs random.

I owned an account with millions of followers on Twitter until recently and sold it and left the platform because of how toxic it is. The platform was on a decline until trump started using to campaign. If/ when he loses, I can see Twitter banning him and losing the engagement his account brought. Or, if he doesn‚Äôt get banned but he‚Äôs smart, he‚Äôll make his own media platform like a podcast and only use Twitter to promote that.

We're back and Michael VIX just continues to make big gains on this drive, VIX is getting it done on the ground and through the air, as here's first down and it's a designed sweep play for VIX! He's gonna get down inside the 10 before he's finally chased out of bounds and this bulls defense is absolutely GASSED right now!
Could possibly be this with Dems winning.

SNAP at 40 is a crime against humanity

MSFT STILL hates 200. Good.
Lowest you will ever AMD again
The confidence this man has in NIO has inspired me to buy in. Also still crying about the NIO shares I sold at like $4 last year
FAAMNG? That's old news bud.

How much money have you lost overall?

(Got 'im)
interesting analogy
"Soon". Do you know how many cars Tesla had to sell and all the Musk manipulation it took for Tesla to be where it is compared to before where it was relatively flat for YEARS. Why do the retards on here think every bullshit ass company is worth billions. You guys want to be angel investors and venture capitalists, while the real angel investors and VCs are cashing out on you. How about holding on to your money and making responsible and intelligent decisions?
Bc I dont understand how
A. You are retarded for buying from best buy. 

B. You are retarded for going to the TardSquad to fix your computer.
Buy tech, democrats love big tech
5 eow. Algos are dumb and they‚Äôd pump it
Hahaha
Those two outcomes aren‚Äôt linear to the market. There was a pandemic this year and the market catapulted after a quick drop.

Markets go down when incumbent is about to lose
Found Hunter.
Short UBER EOD tomorrow. If prop 22 fails in CA, shits tanking. They should also tank on their earnings, which is Wednesday.
What does this mean?
Have to start now and average down. Don't buy all in. When all retards go bull it's too late.

Tweets still gonna be extra spicy till year end
the truly smart people in here are never permanently attached to a position

the smart people are bears right now and will switch to bulls when appropriate because they have reasoning behind their actions not just stocks go up or SPY 200

softbank was sort of telling the truth when they said their billions couldnt really move the market that much...
This downwards pressure is crazy right now, could easily be mostly red across the board by close. 

This makes me think that tomorrow will continue down into Red, but at the same time most of wsb seems to think it‚Äôll be red tomorrow which almost makes me think green.
Man and we got elections tomorrow more shit to fuck up this market
Spy is disintegrating like spiderman.
DGLY up big.  So, the market is ‚Äúforward looking‚Äù by what....24 hours?
I bought a laptop from best buy.  It broke, so I brought it to geek squad for repairs.  They just called me to say they haven't been able to complete the repairs because they dont have a charger for it.  I have to bring them my charger...which I bought from them...for them to complete my repair.

Calls on $BBY because I'm sure I am getting charged extra for this.
pricing the future. New snap users went up. New Twitter users went down. just a guess, though.
lmaoo, and youre gonna watch it run to $4-5 if not $10 in the coming days. sorry
Anyone buying calls for SQ? I think they will blow away expectations. Who else thinks the same?
But calls might be a good idea.

Thats how options work. They end up being very valuable or worth nothing.  Most expire worthless.  Never buy them with the expectation of breaking even.
What if I told you all money is paper money
Tomorrow is going to be a long night. Can already feel it.
Already down 50% on my TQQQ short puts. Why can't I ever just wait a little? I think I'll be good at $107 but it'll be white knuckle over the next few days.

Guess who just got back today

Them wild-eyed bears that had been away

Haven't changed that much to say

But man, I still think them cats are crazy

They were askin' if you were around

How you was, where you could be found

Told 'em you were livin' downtown

Drivin' all the old men crazy

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town)

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town again)

You know that chick that used to dance a lot

Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she got

When I say she was cool she was red hot

I mean, she was steamin'

And that time over at Johnny's place,

Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face

Man, we just fell about the place

If that chick don't want to know, forget her

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town)

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town)

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town)

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town again)

Spread the word around

Guess who's back in town

Just spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill

Down at Dino's Bar 'n' Grill

The drink will flow and the blood will spill

And if the bears want to fight, you better let 'em

That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favorite song

The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long

Won't be long till the summer comes

Now that the bears are here again

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town)

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town)

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town)

Spread the word around

The bears are back in town

(The bears are back in town again)

The bears are back in town again

Been hangin' down at Dino's

The bears are back in town again

Bears are the smart ones? How much crack have you smoked today?
[Take a look at that call/put price skew](https://imgur.com/a/1jR1vTX). That picture was the weekly showing the IV difference, but go look at the other dates and their chains. This is likely to do with warrants getting exercised as NKLA had a similar situation but was much more exaggerated. Buying shares without making an additional options move would be a mistake. I'd recommend waiting until after the warrant situation ends or selling puts at the level the IV skew is dictating the price will be after dilution. 

Edit: I'm interested, but I'd like to do more research before deciding my move and position size.

The longer I‚Äôve been on here the more I‚Äôve learned how fucking dumb most of you bulls are. Legitimately the bears are the smart ones. Bulls never have a reason why we should go up, but bears always have a reason we‚Äôre gonna go down

If you loaded up on puts at open, might want to take a little profit here because there hasn't been much velocity on this dump.
[removed]
I‚Äôm a bear can I eat your ass
If it gets broken.. watch out below.. i see it going to 100 and taking the whole market with it
A commodities trading platform?
SPY crashing in slow motion.
S H A M B L E S
Why is your fridge so dirty like my portfolio?
Spy puts or calls ??
What‚Äôs with twtr
SoftBank can and will pull the order book when you least expect it
don't make the mistake I did and take your profits  
runups in after hours can murder profit
Except who wants to pay higher prices right now when you can buy in later for cheaper..  you want to make money and we literally just had pump and pump and after pump of tech, its time for the money to take profits, which they did as you can see, and now they want to buy in cheaper ... so its waiting time right now for tech.
err you mean 42.069
You‚Äôre buying brand name cereal? How fucking rich are you. This is the wrong sub.
AMZN is so oversold, holy shit
Alexa play welcome to the party by pop smoke
Don't think we're going to drop past 327...tons of buy orders around that price
Accounts blowing up left and right
Feelin so horny rn Jesus
I was so over leveraged still down 8 percent on day an holding puts.
LOL at the bulltard cucks üòé
Any word on what they‚Äôre going to buy?
tech is the one taking the dick right now.
Spy 315
You need to be in position for tomorrow, now.
Gave myself paralysis by analysis. WTF should I do with my money rn
That‚Äôll do it
IDGAF who wins tomorrow as long as they pump the shit out of FB, HD, AAPL and SQ tomorrow night so I can close these calls Wednesday.  Then put Yeezy in there.
Get fucked kettle
Look at NYC
You said it man!
Literally Apple amazon Microsoft and Facebook (39% of the Nasdaq) are crashing the rest of the nasdaq and market god dam
Soon this fridge will be your house.
RIP. Market isn't turning back around for at least a month
Bulls: ah shit here we go again
can you say it 1 more time please
I'm such a poor, bought a single vxx call and hate having money so threw down on a fuckin 280 spy put eow lfg
This is pretty gay dude
Kinda mad that my dad is one of those "save and invest" kinda dads but he never just put like $50 into a stock for me when I was a kid
If QQQ is down .5% I need spy down .75%. Spy has the banks and travel stocks for fucks sake
Made $1k on LL bought 200 shares Friday close
Care to share the DD on NIO? Also any other recos with the market being low?
Ya so sleep cycles usually last 4 hours so I think that‚Äôs what happened, you woke in the middle of a cycle.
Haha buying puts is so easy money. Most of this sub can't bring themselves to buy puts, which is why it's free money
deep state did this
Hate to break it to you but futures mooned all night (Europe and Asia pumping the market up). We are the poor ones that are crashing it right now lol
I can't take this pain anymore. All I see is red.
The last time MSFT closed below 200 was 6/19/20. There is a gap unfilled @ 190.82 from 6/15/20. Could today be the day? ü§î
Pretty much what I‚Äôve been doing for a month but it was way more fun losing money on stupid FDs
Today ended up being a giant bull trap.  RIP bulls
Vibes ‚úÖüíµ
Yes buy them back from me good sir
I understand this but I think the panic has completely taken over and your usual hoarder suspects are buying several times more than they usually do, and even sane people are falling for bad deals out of sheer desperation. For instance, like an idiot I started a new project this Spring in a caliber I hadn't stockpiled prior, and found myself paying nearly 2x regular retail for remanufactured shit just to have enough to test and zero the thing.
k.
holy shit they‚Äôre bringing back the iPod shuffle
Risky but not that stupid if you wanna gamble. Gun to my head calls or puts I'd buy puts too. But my actual play is to do nothing/buy dips in my long term investments cause I have no clue what's gonna happen post election let alone how markets will react.
SPY puts 325
Hour before market close I believe
[deleted]
ARM is the one with NVDA yea, I like that solid move, ARM is well used for embedded processing.
WTB spy 320 / nio 30
Apparently there really is no such thing as free money
i still don‚Äôt think my put prints here but this isn‚Äôt bad
Around 3
You bought 120 $20 puts?
It needs to be broken for good 

Crash all the way to 105
Hey bulls,  eat my ass
As a Californian I too agree California can go to hell.
Nah, I recognize that its gonna happen regardless
RIP in piece
Weve already crashed more than ever in a week before the election, so im with ya
This shit melting down so slowly, its gunna bounce to fuck everyone.
But aren't they offering a bunch of shares at a max sell price around $2.39
Positions?
That SPY drop üòç
Last Friday was the move for that. Youd be up. I got in Friday morning made decent moniez
Idk if I should hold my put overnight
Fuck man I think it's very optimistic to hope it's gonna be over after tomorrow. But I am with you.

Great one more thing to drag the stock down
TWTR should start charging Trump to use TWTR. At least their stock price would start going up

I was like 20 pounds overweight via BMI and I had shit sleep apnea. Might be worth a sleep study for a cpap machine
Go bully someone else.
holup something is amiss here, you claim you have plastic on the fridge for having an asian mom, yet you only have 5 bucks in your account? what kind of asian are you?

and you're probably spending more in electricity to trade than what's in your actual account
&#x200B;

Dug up my old collection. Sold the played and < $20/card and even some empty wrappers for 1k so far.

Sent 50 of the higher end higher grade cards to PSA. It's been 6-weeks, probably wont get them back for another 6-weeks.

Posted sales of my shoebox collection here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18f5iJ3Ye0ip\_sCYYI1\_e1JHV-xftZMIR9PlTf6B9AJ8/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18f5iJ3Ye0ip_sCYYI1_e1JHV-xftZMIR9PlTf6B9AJ8/edit#gid=0)
Bear market price action.  Futures manipulation to gap up and then fade all day.  Probably fed pumping money via futures for banks to suck off the tip during market hours.  No momentum in any direction, VIX this high means whole indexes move like penny stocks.  Bears are in control.
How about a peeing video
SELL SELL SELL
107.80 support to the penny
I said it 27 minutes ago. I'll say it again...

NIO and LL are the safe havens today.
And in case anybody forgot. FOMC on Wed-Thursday. You know, if there wasn't enough going on right now
I send my condolences
[deleted]
r/optionmillionaires
SPY puts or SPXL puts better if the election gets fucky and there‚Äôs riots? SPXL obviously riskier but if the market tanks it‚Äôs a gold mine.
PC or an iPad.   I used my phone until I lost >$1000 in the bathroom messing with futures when the wifi cut out, and I didn't want to run out into the middle of my office with my pants down. Upside: Price floor on my dignity has been firmly established.
That euphoria at open though

Hey bulls! How does it feel getting cucked nearly every single day?
RIP to the last 250 they had in 0dte 340c
~what time does RH automatically sell contracts?
Holy shit AMD why
Urge. To. Fomo. Rising.
Love me some IV and AAPL
right, I have AMD shares as well. I like these two long term, which is why I bought the shares. the short term action is nothing I really care about, if we move down I will average down my costs if we go far enough. To me the future is about parallel processing.
I‚Äôm up on 311p 11/6 lol. How much longer i hold on? We over 2.11
From 500$ down last week to 1.2k up today just on NIO shares and SNE calls. And I don‚Äôt what the fuck I‚Äôm doing
So you‚Äôre saying it still has more pump in it then
I‚Äôm just joking you‚Äôre good ‚úåüèº I wish I w as cash gang rn
A trump victory is already priced in

Sorry to everyone who wasnt in SNE this past week. You missed out on some tendies

Imagine not buying puts earlier today
Buy the BRK.A dip
Jokes on you guys, ants can carry 100x their body weight in puts
[deleted]
Quiet you.
Bought spy puts right at the top feelsgoodman
Bought a straddle Friday. Sold my short end at the first dip today. Sold my long leg at the top and then bought weekly puts when it was 331. This game is too easyüòÇ

As someone who buys social media ads, this isn‚Äôt surprising at all. Facebook (and IG) first, and Snap is what we think will be the best returns in the coming years. Wouldn‚Äôt spend a dime on direct response Twitter ads, it‚Äôs money in a black hole
imagine making the rules tho

How many hours was it? Could be you woke up during rem which would def make you tried.
Yeah doesn‚Äôt make sense ? So ur saying u sold for a 15k loss?
Stock is bad, its fundamentals are not good and its chart doesn't look good either. It's only a buy if it reports a good ER
I wanna see one of those red candles that makes the rest of the chart smaller, youknowwhattamean?

So this DD is copied and pasted from this website- http://willowdalepartners.com/smith-micro-software/


It also seems to be a bit old..

Their other recommendation- SEAC, didnt fair well
Weird bro almost as if all the negative shit is priced in already
Snap is the new nkla

Took profits on RKT calls and [bought ET 5.5c to undercut the 6c open interest](https://imgur.com/a/Knb7ysO/)
Sold later that  next day.   This comment was posted during after hours before the 21% drop the next day.
Whatever catastrophic crash folks are expecting isn‚Äôt going to happen 

I don‚Äôt make the the rules
Spy just die you bitch.
Welcome to your new nest egg

Remember when it went up for like 3 months on pure fomo?
It doesn't necessarily correlate with price momentum, but stochastics.
This dudes got calls for sure

why the hell would he listen to you though? he just made hundreds of thousands.
AMZN calls are free money here, right?
What do you Americans call it? A banger in the mouth?
idk why i waste money on options. Basically i'm flat on options while making up for all lost time playing es futures.
My guess is you‚Äôll be bagholding for a loooong time
Bulls aren't even going to be able to vote from debtors prison, so sad.
**'TESLA TO UNVEIL UPDATED CYBERTRUCK ELECTRIC PICKUP DESIGN IN 'A MONTH OR SO'' -ELECTREK REPORT**
the market gifts bulls a 2 hour window to sell their calls and instead the reaction is "bears r fuk!!!" all morning while buying more calls and then shit starts selling off and people are crying like it's the most unpredictable event all year
fractional shares I presume
Thoughts and prayers
Bulls capitulating?
325 also.
LMAO, keep doing it!   XD
Yep, keep in mind expiry isnt until 2.5 weeks after ER, so i plan on holding, especially sine the ER will be jacked to the tits. Ive averaged down to 2.00. If we have 3 or 4 days like today we are all green and you can send your kids to private school.
c\_ \_ i  \_
Still recovering from battery day, but playing SPY today is freaking fun.
Isn't it obvious that this was going to happen today?

we're trading in clear bearish channel and we hit the bottom of the channel on Monday causing that faceripper eod

now we hit the top of the channel at 332 and are gonna bleed back to 322

You can probably still just call them fugly

We could easily have record growth immediately after the election, simply because it's over and a victor was decided-stability returns to the market & the vix drops to pre-covid levels because a comprehensive plan (even if it's a fascist agenda) is in place.  That kind of stability can't be bought, so the svxy could moon the day after the election.
I been trying to figure this out too

I'm suspecting low levels of Vitamin D or K2 or magnesium
I appreciate what you're trying here, but this is the definition of wrong audience.

You might change some minds but the reality is that the vast majority of people on this sub who actively participate want to hit a lottery ticket. Not set up a stable portfolio.
Looks like very.  Fuck.

That's.....so interesting.  Something about the legal gymnastics folks can pull when it comes to taxes and finances is fascinating to me.

I dunno if that's a good or bad thing, but still so damn fascinating haha
don't sell
Couple possible reasons:

-Too much sleep can cause grogginess 
-Depression 
-Eating shit food the day before 
-Drinking the night before can cause interrupted sleep
-Sleep apnea
Keep shorting AMZN. It's going down another 10%.
Are you overweight? Do you snore?

Probs throwing $1,100 away on these VXX calls, but it's worth the small hedge on all my other shit.
Remember when Amazon smashed earnings and then went bankrupt?
what about the next day and next few months since then?
Well I was planning on getting in on a dip but it just keeps going up. If it isn‚Äôt under 27 within the next 10 trading days I give up.
Believe it or not I was gonna comment the sub but I forgot the name somehow...Idk how I got into college sometimes
Not explicitly, but I think it's a good enough signal.
It is weird how 323 has such strength when it gets crossed both up and down.
sell all the the things
if there is indecision regarding the winner, the market will probably dump. If there is a decision immediately, the market will probably be fine, maybe pump for a bit.
Gotta wait till Biden is officially elected or you might get clapped hard
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the USS WSB, where we pride ourselves on going straight down.  


Our current destination is 11/20 DNKN 105 puts, and the weather looks clear for a tank with strong pressure coming from elections and the inevitable drop from this peak.   


We look forward to your continued patronage on this voyage of tendies, and we hope you enjoy your stay. And remember, my wallet runs on DNKN.

Salivating for it to drop to $195. Loading up on shares then.
There's bullshit support all the way down. We're set up for blood.
[deleted]
Yeah, zoom out a little more, it's _always_ been doing that hockey-stick thing (it's probably gonna keep doing it after this tiny down turn). This is just a good spot to buy if you haven't already.
[deleted]
At least they are shares lol
Just fucking dump already

Closing half my puts today bc I know this shit has retard strength at 323

It's called a telephone. As per the fine print in you account agreement, all they have to do is make a "reasonable effort" to contact you.  There is no requirement that they actually do.
I want to make a play that makes the least sense.

Either hugely bullish play or count on SPY being flat. I‚Äôm still bag holding SPY puts from Friday when I was counting on the early plummet.
If you're not shorting RCL and the rest of these cruise lines when they're about to bounce off MA, I don't know what to tell you.
To all the bulls that gave bears shit today...

...this is your reward.

VIX is already so high. We had riots all through the summer & market didn‚Äôt care. I bet we see VIX fade. Everyone is expecting unrest, more covid & future lockdowns. Most likely nothing will be as bad as predicted.
That's what he said
Yeah this isn't 100% a positive though. With a better marketing team i feel like they could have ridden the IPO hype way more effectively instead of it just being a meme for a little.
will be a lot lower later.
We crashing!

Any reason for puts on amazon? All i see is upgrades for the last 2weeks. 
Amazon is pricing the Biden‚Äôs presidency?
AMC bout to drop some surprising revenues for the quarter that they know will beat expected earnings. Only reason I can think that they‚Äôd offer more shares to raise cash right now.

Jpow took the week off boiz, time to drain the swamp
Nice
yeah i fuckin wish
Yeah, but set it and forget it mentality is king. Being an active investor isn‚Äôt for everyone. While 2008 may have broken a lot of trust in the market for some Americans, most couldn‚Äôt tell you what their 401K is comprised of. They also don‚Äôt count for inflation, market‚Äôs clawing back large losses, and lost compound interest gains. 

Your every day American isn‚Äôt going to bounce on their 401K, for a ton of reasons. But yes, I agree.
Jesus AMZN. And to think if the market wasn't up so big to begin with, Amazon would be sucking even more shit.
Yeah, makes you wonder where AMZN would be if they hadn't blown away predictions
Fuck tech all in cheesecake factory
I‚Äôve made money on my 0dte spy 329 puts, took my profit like a smartyü§ì. What‚Äôs the next move fellas?
I had sooo many chances to buy calls instead of averaging down on puts.
üò¨üò¨üò¨
$7 in Apple in 1996 would be worth $37,000 today
The GME yolo guy has been holding for a year.
your TSLA yolo is not changing the world
Proof or ban.
The volume needs to be at least....3 times this size!
That‚Äôs what she said
You posted something similar with a HUGE buy on SPY last week at 329. It doesn't mean anything without more context, could just be a hedge
This shot crashing and you still holding your calls like an idiot
instability is the markets greatest enemy.  Spy was at 75 when obama became president and ending at like 230.  The idea that Dems are bad for markets has never really been true.  That last bad dem economy was carter.  

What are you talking about?
So I‚Äôve rolled my 13x  $50c‚Äôs into 2x $45c‚Äôs. I averaged down as much as I could stomach but that 50 is way out of reach. Maybe we see mid 40‚Äôs by earnings and I‚Äôll let them fly on the higher IV. For now man it‚Äôs getting tough to watch this thing hover in the high 30‚Äôs low 40‚Äôs everyday.
Twitter is less then snap, makes sense to me
SPY 312P 11/2 will make me a Lamborghini owner
I jumped into SNE calls on the TikTok news and lost $1k in 5 mins.  
  
I held off on buying FTCH calls and could have made up that difference.  
  
Here's hoping my SPY and QQQ puts rescue my from my retardation.
Everyone else is assuming there's going to be a big crash after the election- what if there isn't?

slow melt up back to around 1 point on SPY starting now.  EOD will probably see a push to 1.5 points.  Not going to dump with the polls for biden that came in over the weekend and this morning.  contested election looking like 33% or so odds at best.

Well see about that
"Sane investing"

We don't do that here, Mr. Cramer.
Apple really thinks it can save a sell off by making a stupid ass announcement no one cares about
This isn't a good analogy. IV could go up after the election if there's no clear winner. That doesn't really happen with an earnings report - it would be more like if a company decided to delay their earnings call at the last minute.
That happened to me in July. So hard to ditch losers after getting burned when they rip.

Fair enough. But they're up 10x on the year already. Why weren't people this bullish on the stocks pre covid? I hate j pow. I hate QE. I want fundamentals to matter because they have for every decade except this last one.

STOP RESISTING
Doubt it, and I have a 280p
~225 EOD
I was looking at the 2000 crash last night & I think a lot of traders forget how long a market can go down for. 

Even buying SPY. If you bought any time in 2000 you basically held until 2008 to break even - & then the market tanked again. You would then have to hold through to 2013 to get back. So brutal! 

No wonder it took this long to convince retail traders to get back into the market. DCAing down for 2 years would have been painful.
Anytime man. Good luck!
the fact my 322p expiring today isn‚Äôt completely  worthless has to mean something
Fuck, prob coulda held my puts longer but I‚Äôll secure the 1k for the day.

VIX is already pretty high. Would take a serious leg down for it to break out above 40.
The best thing I can say about my performance the last few weeks is I've correctly ditched losers before they got worse. Not much winning going on.

so basically you're  saying he's  golden right now
Also 120% IV, I‚Äôm not sure how to play this, earnings will prob kill the IV, and election might possibly help that too idk. Luckily the shares are cheap so just stocks can still make a good return

Not political but the market has gone down every single time a democrat has won the presidency since 1992 if I‚Äôm not mistaken
Trump is just gonna flood cash into the market for a temp boost. Then it will go right back down if not worse.

Not sure the exact point you are making, but I think you are pointing out that we are all swayed by adds whether we know it or not.

I very much agree with that sentiment. I have been on a social media, and digital content cleanse for a few weeks and that was part of what spurred this thought process. It has done a lot to change my perspective of the current market and how I interact with the companies I do and do not support.

Two main reasons:

1. Hyliion isn't the only CNG/RNG power train, true. But, whatever they've developed far surpasses whatever else is on the market performance wise. See the Wegman post I linked to for proof. It's not that RNG engines don't exist, but rather, they don't exist with enough power to pull a big semi loaded to the brim...until now

2. Software. Similar to how Tesla operates, trucks transmit data back to HQ on how the power train is operating, where the truck is consuming energy from, etc etc so they're able to optimize. I think Healy discussed this on the most recent JMac Investing interview, I am a bit too lazy to dig it up but tl;dr they are basically a software company as well, just catered to big trucks not consumer vehicles.

Slow bleed for now and everyone will soon start to notice and be pressured to sell and that‚Äôs when spy will tank quickly
Girlfriend walked out on me, my portfolio is in shambles...what a fucking time to be alive
In the short term, possibly, but you have a novel trading environment. Oversold won‚Äôt come home to roost until stability is restored. However, tech has also been over valued consistently for awhile. They‚Äôve padded in a lot of room to fall, especially any tech that posts actual revenue and not negative EPS.
EOD pump scheduled at 3:50 pm.
Basically yeah it won't mean shit in the end.
So is SPY just gonna try to find resistance at each whole dollar on the way down?
Haven't you learned by now
Yeah I can‚Äôt decide what would be best in the ‚ÄúAmerica goes to shit‚Äù scenario, VXX calls or SPY/QQQ puts.
ATHX is the future of medicine. Won't hold your hand through this, but the DD is out there if you feel like digging. Huge payoff coming between now and June 2021. More payoff to come for years to come. GL

Worried that it will touch one of my strikes, in this case I‚Äôd be worried the market takes a shit and hits the bull spread.

Me this week after joining  cash gang:


Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice

Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
yeah if the screenshot is indicating anything, the person who took it is highlighting the 10k call contracts for 33.97 for some reason. Possibly because it's a good one to take.

EDIT - It makes sense that this person would do this, because the strike price dropped and NIO is a very bullish stock. It's most likely a good play based on NIOs uptrend

If the election results are contested by either side it will not be good. Trump has said he already will if Biden wins. This not good for a democracy and how civil wars start. I doubt that would be great for the market.

Sure they do, if their party also controls congress and the president pressures them to start passing federal gun control laws that effect how hard it is to buy a gun in every state. Or by simply not vetoing any gun control law that congress might come up with on their own. 

So I have to ask... What's the logic behind your statement? Did you forget that federal laws exist? Do you think that state laws supercede federal laws?

As a consumer (we all are) one has power by steering choices in our best interest.

You might think you already do. And then you are around advertisements. And you still think you follow your best own interest. Ad industry spends allot of money. Not because they are stupid. Reducing the amount of advertisements in your life is very helpful. And doable.
solar and wind are cheaper then oil and gas already. long term would be a smart move but I'm retarded so what do I know about smart moves.

The future is always unpredictable no doubt. NIO is luxury EV is what I was trynna say. Look up that NIO lifestyle is absolutely insane. I drive a Toyota lol but they may not sell the most cars like Toyota a year they just need to take up a good majority of the luxury EV sector in China. It‚Äôs almost like how Ferrari doesn‚Äôt need to sell 1,000,000 cars they just need to maintain a high quality car and take up the majority share in high quality cars. It‚Äôs a risk no doubt but the reward is to high to miss out on

Trust me I have lost a ton of money on weeklies. They‚Äôre tempting because they‚Äôre cheap. But just like far OTM plays, they almost never work. Yoloing your entire account is a quick way to blow it up. But most people fall victim to the slow bleed. They keep buying weeklies because they‚Äôre cheap, then deposit another small amount and repeat. Before they know it they‚Äôre down 20k. If you still want to play around with lotto tickets (because they can be fun) just make a rule to not spend x % on them. Hell even better, open up another brokerage account. You‚Äôll soon see that account at zero and realize you‚Äôre just lighting money on fire. Cheaper options, spreads, no weeklies, occasional lotto for extra fun. Take it from someone who learned the hard way.

I've even had it with a little answer triangle doesn't even pop up it just stays down in the liquid it won't give me any kind of answer. But I still count on it. I wonder how much I could get on eBay for an antique or vintage magic 8 Ball. I need the money and I might even still have the packaging it came in. F****** magic 8 Ball!

It feels like the price action is reflecting news from the quarter and the news might knock down the stock.

1 /MES contract is the same as 50 shares of SPY. /ES is 500 shares of SPY. They both have options and trade 23 hours a day with a break from 4pm to 5pm CT every day. That's pretty much all you need to start.

toyota sells 10,000,000 cars/ year
Nio will sell 35,000 this year??

toyota market cap 215b (profitable, proven, reliable)
Nio market cap 44b (no history yet)

Toyota makes 285x + more cars
Toyota market cap is 4.88x of Nio.

It's a fucking bubble, that does not mean it cannot succeed long term but how can anyone confidently invest at these levels?
Omg it's happening!! üêª

Come on drop faster
Its a hedge.  Look at the Put side for 22.50
AMZN going to 2741
Horrible growth and overvalued as shit during covid. You have chinese knockoff TSLA doing circles around that sinking ship stock price for over a year now.
Most likely yes.. look how they do it.

Notice the dip and then it will go back up.. that dip you see is when options are "priced" lower" and even though it will go back up, your options are now valued lower than before so it will be in a sense "crushed" some or decayed in value just from that dip even though you are right back to where you started on the price of the underlying stock...

Now is a good time to buy your SPY calls.  QQQ keep waiting.
Alright I sold my CXW and CGC calls cuz they already printed. Got my CRSR 11/20‚Äôs and LEAPs plus some 11/13 SPY puts for if the market shits itself short term so I can double down on CRSR

 a few little cut and paste HYLN tidbits I been collecting, let the other suckers buy NIO at the top we in at the bottom with HYLN, the wait should be worth it, fear not the meme stock ...

*" Fact is they have their erx product that is almost ready to go. Fully electric power train, 1300 mile range, full analytics and optimization system and can haul up to 80,000 lbs as far as I know no fully electric class 8 truck manufacturer can come close to those numbers. Even tesla battery tech can't come close to that. "*

*"Amazon, UPS, and Wal-Mart will be announced after the 40 day post IPO quiet period ends." Merger was 9/28, so that would be 11/7. Former White House Chief 0f Staff, Former Schneider CEO, Publix CEO, and ALL top notch talent are on the board or hold high level positions."*

*" the Idaho Reporter wrote "Hyliion ($HYLN) stock expects a falling knife in a week."* [*www.idahoreporter.com/...*](http://www.idahoreporter.com/2020/hyliion-hyln-stock-expects-a-falling-knife-in-a-week/) *One point in the article was that warrants can be exercised 30 days after merger, which would be about November 1. The article states "Do not try to catch the falling knife once it starts going down. Wait until the stock hits the bottom, which is around $22."*

*" For the most part, the stock has stayed below $23.71 since 10/20. If it goes above $23.71, it becomes profitable to execute the warrants, and thus dilute the shares. "People will exercise the HYLN.WS warrants and sell the equity HYLN until they are at parity. "*

You only need around 25 shares to do it. You don't have to put up 100% collateral to sell calls.

I don't think anything above 33 or 34c expiring this Friday is going to print. Im just trying to break even and get out at this point. I think we'll see the stock continue to rally throughout the rest of the week tho. Guess there's only one way to find out
Won‚Äôt know tomorrow
Stop buying weeklies. Seriously. I‚Äôve learned to try and never let anything get within a week of expiration. Either dump it or roll it out. You can still yolo some 1 or 0 dates. But don‚Äôt let your main plays get close to expiration.

They're forgetting most Americans just don't give a shit. The only thing bringing lock downs is legit over capacity hospitals. Over capacity like dead bodies rotting in the parking lot. Short of that, we won't lock down.
Premiums are insane. No thanks
Or rather, didn't
Trump has already said that he won't shut things down again. Biden has said 'I will listen to the scientists' so you can make a guess there.

Thanks, one question. The call and puts wont be priced the same. For example the put can be .70 and the call can be 1.5, what do you do in that situation? How do you buy? 

I guess in this scenario you need a downward move of 0.70 relative to strike and 1.5 relative to strike to be profitable

GS expects the current Covid19 wave in the US to: 
 
-Trigger lockdown measures for 15+ US states in November & Trigger lockdowns for 75% of US population by late December with material risk of a nation-wide lockdown by then. The increasingly explosive case growth is expected to push new cases well above levels leading lockdowns in Europe recently. 

-Require lockdowns to remain in place until March to offset the seasonal upward pressure on Rt, or at least until measures such as vaccines become effective in reducing Rt otherwise 

-Be color blind, even if some red states will require lockdowns earlier

Theta decay will eat any possible profits due to the premium of the option you would be purchasing. If the delta is high, the option premium nears a 1:1 ratio to the underlying price. So low delta means you get less ROI for the option, especially the longer it takes to get to ATM. Combine those two, and time will eat your lunch, just because of theta decay and piss poor returns even if the underlying asset starts trending in the direction you picked. 

Basically: low delta - price on the underlying asset moving has a lower return/risk. 
High delta - closing into a 1:1 match with underlying asset value.
Theta - why your options drop in value every minute they continue to exist OTM.
That shits expensive yo

What do you think about a decentralized peer-to-peer unsecured or partially secured lending platform? I have a feeling it can work if lenders lend to a pool, and based on the amount lent, have more or less say in which debtors to approve to withdraw from the pool. Debtors pay funds directly back into the pool, with interest split pro rata among lenders. Maybe offer low interest rates, but have as collateral wage garnishment and garnishment of other claims, which can be called only on debtor default.

Yeah, once you realize that's how NIO works you can be a lot more comfortable holding your calls.

I've fucked myself TWICE now selling my stuff while NIO was flattish thinking I would time it. Sure enough, I sold my spreads on Friday to day trade with the money, and then didn't get back in (Thinking that election was going to make the market falter), and then it does this.

How would one apply that saying towards losses?
I understand theta gang plenty, and reasonable minds would disagree on making the trade before/after the election. There‚Äôs more than one way to theta tendies but it‚Äôs basically a fact that you get more premiums before the election vs after, obviously more risk but that‚Äôs part of the fun.

Why tf is BAC so high
Thanks rainman
RKT May close green today.
Why
If you‚Äôre buying a call and the delta is 0.20 and the theta is -0.40 you would most likely lose money even if the stock went up because the theta would be eating away too much premium. Only way an option like that is profitable is if you sell it the same day or if it has a big spike up. A 1-2% move up won‚Äôt be enough for you to really make any profit. You would most likely lose money if it went up 1-2% the next day

A Biden win comes with a corporate tax rate increase of 7-14%. Hope your calls are dated for 2022, but who am I kidding, you are here with us.

Omg if TSLA pumps to 410 by eow I might kinda only be -25 % all time.
Anyone else bought calls on apple. No. Okay
No. Go long volatility for the election itself, then right after when everyone's panicking, go short volatility.
this game will tie and go into OT

It's amazing how "investors" are piling up and dying to buy stonks as fast as they can one day before election with all this uncertainty going on. Like they want to buy stonks so badly that they can't wait another day or two for some of the uncertainty to settle.

Got in early and made a killing on shares then made a killing selling calls. Dumped everything but 200 shares last time it hit $16.

Some guy on Reddit said he hated guns and was a big liberal (moderate lib here). Dude said he and his wife just picked up two guns in fear of unrest. It‚Äôs not about Biden legislation. It‚Äôs about fear of police not being there to help from such mass conflict. 

The right have their guns. Maybe they buy some more. But liberals buying guns? Almost none of my liberal friends have guns. That would be massive. And they‚Äôd only do that for safety, not just bc fear of gun control. 

Idk man. They‚Äôre still pumping.
why would anyone think they'd have an event for a buyback?

This is not TA. The only real TA I see is the market predicting a Biden win. I still think Orange Daddy has a good a shot as any but the election is definitely causing uncertainty. Ever since the beginning of the pandemic, the market has been running on emotion more than we're used to, and it obviously hasn't stopped

All Tim Apple had to do was provide a little guidance and we wouldn't be in this mess. Mr. Market is sending a message, "Whatever it is, it's too little too late."
It might. But also might not idk.
Because they can use election fears to knock it down cheaper while selling puts, and then buy shares and then let it cook post election knowing consumers will flock back during a lockdown probably. Look at France, banned from buying non-essential items in person, yet you can purchase anything you want from online retailers.

Gotcha, i actually have quite a bit of cash secured puts on them right now for 11/20 that is ITM, so likely will get assigned, which was my intention. So just wanted to see how the timing on this warrant situation would work. Thank you for the detailed explanation.
I just do it every Monday Wednesday and Friday. Monday‚Äôs usually have significant movements (more than 3 dollars). Wednesday are usually flat 10% gain. Friday being a tossup of being a mini Monday or a 15-20% gain.
Saw this morning they're releasing some new bundling subscription package... A collective "meh" at best, IMO.

It was coming up on when the ban expired.  Everyone knew that was going to happen if you even remotely follow those stocks.  And regardless it was a solid buy just based on support

Oh man to be on the selling side of THAT call...

I see you but TSLA has barely topped 500bil market cap at its peak. Meaning it‚Äôs lifetime gainz are at best 1/4th what AAPL needs in the next couple months.

Idk if that way of looking at it actually makes sense, but it certainly points out the absurd. In a perfect world Apple would need to innovate and generate 4X TSLA in a space where they don‚Äôt already dominate the market (before Jan).
Ah yes maybe this Apple event will be completely different than the last 2 and earnings üöÄ- retards here

Are you surprised to see him back in the game so soon?

Well, if he passed their protocol, even if he's shaken up a bit, the bears know that Michael VIX gives them by far the best chance to win even if he's not at 100%
I wouldn't recommend puts or going short.  I fully expect AUY to go to $7 or get bought.
VIX and SPY still trending up.  Who will win?
There is no red stock market. There is no green stock market. There is only the united stock market. And that market is fuk.
Nice keurig, pleb

Aye, can you watch porn on that thing?
Might be less profitable but today looks like a bump and sideways tomorrow. Biggest question will really be how hyped the stock looks. Keep tabs on HK 9988 (HK listed version of Baba denominated in HK dollars, ROUGHLY a USD). It will give you a half days head start on what the US market may look like.
Yeah I may pickup one or 2 more end of day because no way the market doesn‚Äôt go red on Election Day and the day after when no victor is announced
The aforementioned clowns contribute but they contribute every year. Given that we've already broken records and it isn't even black friday yet should indicate new customers are moving into the market and paying absurd prices because they don't know any better. I've never seen shortages this extensive or ammo prices this absurd. Increasing the amount of gun owners in a very short period will cause a demand shock for ammo.

Are you doing this consistently 3 times per week, or speculatively on days when you expect higher volatility or significant moves?
Sold my 11/20 $30C day after earnings due to the general market pullback and feeling like it was gonna be too far OTM and get hit with theta decay. Still holding $26C & $28Cs, will sell on market bounce later this week if it happens.
Agreed. Even Green Day‚Äôs like today don‚Äôt make me feel much better. Need a big lift from earnings to dig out of this hole. Those November‚Äôs most people are on are going to be rough.

Why is tech selling off so much? Pricing in a Biden win and stimulus or what?

It rebalances every day so that‚Äôs not the issue here. *Current* day TQQQ is tracking lower than QQQ.

NIO printed for me as well today.  Had $28 11/6c until I sold this morning after I saw the big spike.

1. They were literally getting so many orders but were unable to produce them cause of production. 

2. 100% growth year over year is literally insane

3. China government backs them up. Also China is trynna go full EV 2060 

4. I forgot Tesla sold 500k cars their first year of existence. NIO mkt cap is a tenth of Tesla so idk why you all upset

5. You dumb
Amen
Yeah Gus, great coverage downfield but VIX is clearly still hurting from that last shot he took on third down in the last series, you'd expect that he'd look to gain a few yards on the rollout here but instead he throws it away and avoids a big hit
Until the next stimulus check.

Market is making bets on Biden rn.

Oil is going up because they're banking on increased regulations and decreased subsidies, which should tighten supply and/or just outright raise prices.

Certain stuff in industrials and construction is probably going up too in anticipation of infrastructure spending, but idk shit about those sectors.

This will probably be as good as it gets for tech if this what's going on and players may have already begun their rotations out a month ago or more.

Spy Calls nov 3. As long as election isn't contested
.... right
So here's VIX back under center now, three receivers split right, back goes in motion to the left, Michael VIX takes the snap and drops back, going through his progression and he's gonna be flushed out of the pocket, moving to his left and he just throws this one away. He had nowhere to go with that one as good coverage down there forced the incompletion.
Relax buddy, nows your chance ya dingus
TQQQ limited down on Friday and caught a shortselling restriction. I think that might have something to do with it at least. Not sure
UVXY calls. 12/18 85c is what I‚Äôve got
Cuz if tqq was at 100, and qqq goes down 1% then tqqq goes down 3% and is then at 97. If qqq goes back up 1% then tqqq goes up 3% to 99.91.

Hahaha that's sooo good! I want one.
Probably, as a major binary event is over. But I would say if Trump/Biden has a small lead (<1000) in PA, FL, OH, TX, MI and the electoral count hinges on it, then there are going to be lawsuits and such for at least a month so VIX should stay pretty high. Doubtful that Biden concedes in the same timeframe as Hillary (i.e. Election night) unless it's painfully obvious and it would be highly doubtful for Trump conceding this week regardless of the gap.

If amzn msft and aapl fall the whole market will follow
The market has been pricing in some degree of expected election chaos all month. The question is, will things go smoother than expected or not? Nobody knows the answer to that and the market certainly doesn't know. So everybody is just trading based on the ordinary technical indicators now. People are shorting at resistance (331.5 currently) and buying off support.

I'm still holding because I bought an aggressive position in the last five minutes of the day on Friday that I expected to unload at the last second for a quick profit during an EOD dump before the weekend. Instead we got that $2 green candle and now I'm trapped. These puts will expire worthless on Wednesday if the market doesn't go test 320, which is a coin flip
I honestly think NIO has a better chance to hit 150
For better or worse. Wouldn't mind a little pump from him, but homeboy is meeting Justin Trudeau and getting shit done, so it's ok.
You obviously haven‚Äôt been paying attention. The results won‚Äôt be ready tomorrow because PA and NC are accepting mail in ballots up to 3 days after tomorrow. Unless it‚Äôs a total blow out we won‚Äôt know til end of week
How's your day going?    Lol
I know as soon as I say enough is enough everything will rebound
So far all my calls and puts are in the red. Good start!
EOD dump seems so obvious like Friday, probably gonna pump on nothing watch
Thank you!!
No, let it stay up. Everytime a retard posts something, just do almost the exact opposite.
wtf rcl went from -3% to green because nclh suspends sailing through dec and that is bullish apparently

With good news, they could make it up very quickly indeed, but ultimately they make it up with earnings. If the company is earning more than they're "losing" by paying dividends each year (or quarter), the chart will tend higher even as investors get distributions.

Companies paying dividends that exceed earnings will weaken their balance sheet and potentially be unable to afford dividends or growth investments. Yikes!

You could be right that CN EV production competition becomes a 0-sum game for business in the next couple years. 

But, we could be underestimating China‚Äôs production capabilities and greater commitment to EV‚Äôs. The fact that NIO is going to be stuck co-oping with the CHINESE gov might not turn out to be as limiting a factor in that regard. We will see, TSLA to the moon either way.

You keep saying this but aren‚Äôt providing anything concrete. Sure there was portfolio rebalancing, but DXY has found support above 94. Even on days where the market is up, DXY stays up. To me, that‚Äôs a bearish indicator. 

But if you‚Äôre going to talk about ‚Äúdata‚Äù and ‚Äúindicators‚Äù but not actually specify what you mean then I think you‚Äôre just bullshitting.

How are your spy puts you opened eod Friday doing boys?
I a bought 31K (55) NIO 40Cs for May. I think longer calls for NIO are the way to go, plenty of room to run. NIO bears wanna cry about it but they literally can only make money scalping or on a lucky weekly.
To a degree this sub just reflects general sentiment.  If there is mania driving a bubble, you can tune in here to see the mania.  If there is pessimism driving a drop, you can tune in here to see the pessimism.  This sub is useless as predicting trends.  When people on here are predicting the future, those predictions are much more useful at explaining todays movements than to accurately determine anything about the future.

yea I wondered about this, I know social media feeds us what it thinks we want to see, but I have only seen people swopping to Trump throughout the last months, as well as way more support for Trump, and some surprising influencers changing camp too. at this moment I expect Trump to be a landslide, but will be interesting to see if it is just social media feeding me algo driven context. which would be odd since most social media sites seem driven to support Biden.

which is why I suspect that Robinhood traders are such a perceived threat to the establishment.  We don't know what the fuck crayons are for other than eating.

Everyone is up at least 100% today right?
We were trading below the bottom bollinger band. Nothing drops or rises in a straight line. Even in March there were big green days on the way down and big red days on the way up. We could see 2 days of buying even with chaotic election news. 

If you want to buy puts, you have to time your entries and set a trailing stop loss. Maybe buy puts at 331.5 and be prepared to lose 25% and bail on the trade if it keeps rising. 

Feel bad for the TA deniers here.

Man the auto-debt cycle is disgusting. A guy that works for me had his car repo'd, he went out and immediately bought a new $30k vehicle with no verifiable income and bad credit. Mine was slightly more expensive, I have a shorter term on my loan, and his payment is DOUBLE mine. Like wtf. Basically they just collect usurious interest for a year or two until he can't keep up or wants a new whip. They profit so much off the interest that its greater than the repo expense & writedown.
I mean the most he'll lose is about 11k to 12k so it's not exactly a risky play

Big buyer of Dec-11 3000C on AMZN

It had zero OI going into today and some whale loaded 15M of calls today.
Hyliion filed paperwork last week simply stating to the SEC that warrants existed. That‚Äôs it. They filed this because they were SPAC warrants, and now they‚Äôre HYLN warrants.

It takes the SEC about 30 to 45 days to approve this paperwork. Once they do approve it, Hyliion could say ‚ÄúOk everyone, you have thirty days to exercise your warrants into shares.‚Äù This is what the other commentator alluded to. When Nikola did this, the share price dropped, because the warrants were converted into stock, which everyone sold ASAP to lock in their profits.

Truthfully one of many things could happen. Hyliion could *not* recall warrants‚Äîthe have five years to do so. Or, people could convert the warrants into stock, and simply not sell‚Äîthe only reason people sold is because they bought warrants low and sold them high. What if you bought warrants high, and wanted to break even on stock price?

Me personally I do believe HYLN will call them back, but I don‚Äôt think waiting for that event is a good enough reason to not buy now, because even if they did there‚Äôs no reason stock price couldn‚Äôt go up before then‚Äîlate Nov / early Dec is a lifetime away.
Good christ the IV on vix calls is 272%!?!?

Tbh I have no idea who is going to win, but I do think that no matter what the person that loses will try to contest it which would make my puts very happy

Depends. Do you think Trump will win?
How long dated are you buying
Sell the fridge so that you actually have some money to put into your account.
It‚Äôs manipulation so, we should be going down but they want us up for whatever reason. Probably to get retail to load up on more weekly calls by pumping monday and then letting it fall tuesday/Wednesday. Can‚Äôt tell you what to do but imo we‚Äôre headed down

Serious: was there any annoucment to make it this green? Or is this people just seeing a dip and buying before election, knowing it will go up right after? I'm not fucking complaining by any means just wondering if I missed something.
Who‚Äôs ready for NIO to pump that big Green vein üòàü§ë

Ah boy, fourth down and Gus this was a great throw by Michael VIX, SPY had just enough separation and VIX put this one right where it needed to be, this is just a fantastic play in coverage by Blackstone

Buy a share man
333 incoming hop on nowwwww
Yeah this. I don't know the specific cases but I suspect they did it too quickly, so BK court was able to claw it back as a fraudulent transfer. Let it age a little bit so it's not on last year's budget. You don't even want "student loans" on their radar or in the conversation. Pay the loans down on auto-pay over twelve monthly chunks etc. This pushes out the whole timeline but be deliberate.
How dare you?

Did I miss the tech dip FUCKK
Lmao I financed 28k, it‚Äôs worth at least 42 as of now. They bottom out at about 17-22k with 100k miles. I will never be upside down on the truck, probably trade it in for something in a year or two.
Nice nio bounce at the 32 previous ath
then why'd u say you bought a truck at $53k msrp when you """"really bought it"""" for $37k? lmao and no used trucks don't cost that much

you gotta remember things are going to still need to be financially stimulated - so that doesn't change, we still have QE and all the other JPow tricks but without having some retard on twitter threatening countries and crashing the market every other day based on rumors and hearsay the market might continue to go up not just match previous highs before taking a fat dump.
40c might been better tbh

If you want to be full WSB (read: a retard) then yeah Nov 13.
Agreed brother. Glad I dogged that bullet.
There's something happening in here. What it is, ain't exactly clear.

There's a man with puts over there, telling me I got to beware.
Already got $230K in it.  And it's not for the divvies.  I'd be a lot happier if they used that cash to pay down debt or buy back shares.

Man this boring movement looks planned
Imagine when Pfizer announces vaccine results, market will moon even more.  Should be within 2 weeks.
AMC's survival plan relies on them issuing 20 million new shares, AND their theaters would need to be open for all November and December. They're fucked
If it follows the pattern they dump on a Green Day and pump on a red day
They were also sending push notifications thru the app saying to vote yes or uber would have to leave ca or something like that. Not enough people aware of labor laws, and too gullible imo

Stuff like oil probably dips but overall the increased stability that the election being over will bring probably brings some improvement. However, given that that's my hypothesis the exact opposite will probably happen.
this market is gonna slump into tomorrow. just watch.

Honestly all these posts about the past is irrelevant. This election is so different compared to the others.
Lol it‚Äôs not even about race. I try to just see humans as humans. However we have gotten a lot of BLM ‚Äúprotests‚Äù lately where they just loot stores and break shit for no good reason. I live in an area with a fairly low black population but I‚Äôm not worried about them because of their skin color. Plenty of white people involved in these riots as well. I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm not in a big city like NYC or Chicago. Those places will have the most shit go down. Suburbs are super safe but even here people are getting nervous. Neighbors are saying they can‚Äôt find ammo and neither can I. Most guns stores low on actual gun stock as well. It‚Äôs like people are expecting a civil war. And if everyone is expecting shit to go down it‚Äôs kind of a self fulfilling prophecy.

If we see under 2.9k I'm definitely adding some.

Not yet. It's so far out of the money that I'd rather just put the money in the next tax year. Already likely in the highest tax bracket this year.
Best to buy on the dip and sell during open. Rarely does it keep mooning even after open.

You do you, boo.

Samsung fridges are absolute shit. $50 says your ice maker is going to leak/break within the next year.

Edit: Being serious though, owned a model similar to this one and needed the ice maker to be replaced twice in the same year. There‚Äôs an ongoing class action lawsuit involving it. I‚Äôd double check your model # and be sure others aren‚Äôt having the same problem - if you can still return it.
I just hope the lunch time heroes come back and see they didn‚Äôt make tend√µes, and smash the sell button

Last Time nio jumped I bought puts and it didn‚Äôt retrace. this time I didn‚Äôt and it died, I‚Äôm gonna stop posting my decisions before I make them, obviously Wall Street is listening

AAPL Dec 20 115 Calls seems like a pretty good deal. Apple is hitting about support right now and with the new iphones coming out i can imagine the stock bubbling in the next 5-6 weeks.

no reason to move out and also no reason to buy a $53k truck lmao

What makes you think that? AMD has exhausted all its cards. Im fucked in the butt
My avg is 25.30 with 324 shares. If it drops to 27ish, I will add more. Not selling.
DD: The only reason nasdaq is behind because a bunch of stupid techies are panic selling their RSUs. Earnings were announced for a lot of the last week, so they probably couldn't sell until *today*. Given the uncoming uncertainty, they're dumping en masse
If you're bull all the time, you make money more than half the time. If you're bear all the time, you make money less than half of the time. If you try play both sides, you can win 100% of the time or lose 100% of the time depending on how skilled you are at speculating.

Since none of us have any skills and this is a casino, I think winning about half the time sounds better than the potential of losing 100% of the time
At least you can stress eat in the same spot you trade
Whew, my FOMO RSI is cooling off after that pullback on NIO
Hopefully work revolves around that 53k truck or that might be one of the dumbest financial decision I‚Äôve ever heard of.

Yeah his share of 65+ voters has dropped and he's still getting absolutely crushed with white suburban women- he EEEEKed out a narrow victory in 2016 winning states like WI with 21k votes and PA with less than that. 
He hasn't done a lot of coalition building (one exception in FL with latino outreach) and instead has focused solely on his base, and while it's almost certain he is going to get more votes than he did in 2016 by focusing only on the base and juicing turnout- I just don't think it's going to be enough to take him over the finish line in states like MI/WI/PA which he needs to win.  
This isn't 2016- Biden doesn't have nearly the unfavorables that Clinton did and he very wisely played the middle, Trump's approval rating has never surpassed 50% nationwide, and the share of votes going to 3rd party this year is 1/3rd of what it was in 2016, and you just can't win with the same 46% of the vote (his share in 2016) if there isn't a sizable chunk going to 3rd parties. 

Donald Trump will declare victory tomorrow night anyway before all the votes are counted that's a safe bet, and PA is a huge spot to watch because SCOTUS has ordered all ballots received after election day to be "Segregated" so they might be "Rememdied" later, so that could be an issue if Biden loses FL and it becomes crucial to his path to 270. 
Overall though there's no way to massage reality to declare that every single data point is moot and he's doing great, he absolutely still has a path to win, but he needs to hold on to every state he won in 2016 and even if he hasn't lost a single voter from 2016 that would be hard because the % of the electorate that is his base (White) has shrunk from 2016 by about 1-2% anyway- so he's got that to overcome as well.
Or vice versa.
The cumulative retardation of this sub is just purely impressive.

AAPL, AMZN, MSFT have so much weighting in SPY that even though 90% of stocks are green SPY is struggling.

Nearly impossible to short NIO. I bought 11/6 30p @ 0.70 when it was up 10% this morning. Got out @ 0.73 when NIO was up 5.5%. Bout to touch 4% and the option is going for nearly the same price.  IV is completely owning that option price

No matter what. It's a solid idea to take out your initial cost. Or even half of that. Just so you can be even more all in mentally. Although, if you can handle the risk, go for it. Best wishes.

I've got a ton in it as well and I'm holding till 100 minimum.

Anyone playing Wayfair earnings tomorrow? If so what‚Äôs the play?
We have to much to gain if spy dumps. So it wont :(
I'm sure you made more money on options too hah. With the market at least you feel in control of your money somewhat which is why this isn't a true form of gambling in my eyes. In a casino if it doesn't go your way, poof all your money is gone. Here at least you can sell before it gets too bad. 

I never want to feel that way honestly but I can imagine. Don't think too negatively about it, it was a learning experience and at least you know the dread that comes with such an outing. Remember that greasy feeling whenever you feel like going to the casino. This way of thinking helps me in disassociating from unwanted behaviors and hopefully it can help you too. Good luck out there

Sure every company makes revenue but the reason Nio is also running is its made strides in generating that revenue and other people/investors see that. Or are you telling me you are the chosen one to see something no one else is seeing?

Tesla has so much more to offer then just selling cars. Tesla has everything vertical integrated. They have around 40billion in assets there own factory's i can continue this list but everyone in this sub should know by know what tesla offers. I dont see an comparison between nio and tesla.
Second drop is always bigger
NIO never went to 36
They are buying the "dip" as always. We'll get to $335 by close.

What bothers me the most is that you've clearly torn the plastic off the bottom half of the door.

You guys just don't get it. Our boy here bought this fridge on credit for the amount of profits he hasn't yet cashed out on his weeklies. By keeping the plastic on, he can sell it as brand new at anytime. Absolute genius.

One of my almost-elderly bros has a multimillion dollar settlement against his name ‚Äî he was a co-business founder where the company and people were all sued after a construction accident ‚Äî¬†so his technically-unmarried spouse owns all their assets and "rents" a room to her essentially-husband. He thought about declaring bankruptcy, but decided it would just be easier to be technically destitute, while living/serving his best friend / lady. They maintain separate, adjacent, legal addresses so that they are less-easily-proven "common law spouses."

Lol, nearly every company in the stock market makes revenue. What kind of lousy ass logic is that. Yes it has potential to run more than 2000 percent. Just not really good odds to bet on it after such a run already..... every China stonk has potential. Just like how the Chinese of Netflix, Starbucks, Twitter, twitch, amazon, etc etc all do too. 

Good luck expecting nio to be the ‚Äúone‚Äù.
The dump at close will be unbelievable

again, it's just pinned to 330

yes, VIX is high, but it's been nuts since last monday.
I just got out of 11/20 40c ... I'll get back in eventually. Take it for what it's worth... Today is the first day in about a week that I don't see NIO dips being bought up within 5-10 min. It is however on its RSI low for 1 and 5 min chart so it's likely oversold right now but I'm still a bit skeptical mainly cause of election.
Fuck off FSLY and DKNG.

Remember a lot of traders don't have experience and started this week out with cash or were already in. As time passes this week they will add more and more to their position size, especially if it trades flat or drifts down. They will be fine at the start, but then they will slowly overexpose themselves. Then once things start getting wild they will either bail due to the volatility increase or barf up their positions from a massive loss. Expect it from them and don't let it happen to you! Don't get lulled into opening more positions during the slow parts of the week!

True money lies in being flexible. And no retards, don't start stretching your damn dick, I meant it in terms of investing.
According to Barrons, Americans have managed to save $1.3 trillion so far this year.  What do y‚Äôall think is going to happen once we have a vaccine and another round of stimulus (in addition to an extremely accommodative FED of course)?  Turn off the mainstream media for a while, Americans are sitting on PILES of money that they are scared to spend right now.  I‚Äôm theta/cash gang until we move through this period of uncertainty, but we are entering into a time of unprecedented prosperity.

[deleted]
was down 96%, and only two weeks ago, i got to -49% now back to -80% all time. so i think yeah but you need luck
How many times do I have to tell you guys

-- Trump pulls ahead, market tanks: Most recently, Trump jumped ahead after his good debate performance and that tanked the market for a few days. Then, on Friday, it came out that he was pulling ahead dramatically with good turn out and Biden was sagging on poor turnout, and it turned the Biden relief rally on Trump's slowing momentum from the debate into another mini-crash day.

-- Biden pulls ahead, markets jump: Today some favorable poll with a big 10% Biden lead nationally came out. Whether this shows Trump's late burst of momentum or not, we'll find out starting tomorrow. 

You can always tell an optimistic Biden rally because it's accompanied by a leap in renewable energy stocks and industrials/infrastructure stocks. You can always tell a doom and gloom Trump market mini-crash because it's accompanied by a bump in the same old stay at home coronavirus stocks that are on the last legs of a bubble and industrials/infrastructure stocks die a little more.

If you listened to me, you'd be making bank on options trading just ahead of these swings
Stop calling me out

Nio has sold every single car they've made so far. They upped production and still sold out. Of all Ev plays, they are possibly the one true competition to tsla. With China's backing, you can expect lot of swings but the market cap is still low. Were you complaining when Tesla had an insane run based on nothing but projections? Or you look at fundamentals only when it's convenient?
I had 30C jans that I sold for a 3 bagger. I would have more today if I held but that is okay. I just took out 11k and bought back in lol. Its so tough to know when to sell but I think on a 100% gain its fine lol

Donnie's plan is to bury the election in lawyers to stop mail-in ballots from being counted after November 3rd, using lawsuits.

He actually said so himself, explicitly.

My guess? If he's so much as tied with Biden by November 4th, he'll declare victory and declare mail-in votes being counted after election day to be a fraudulent criminal conspiracy, using any available avenue to block them, including his 6-3 conservative supreme court.

If Biden wins, no stimulus until Feb, McConnel and Trump have no more incentive to pass anything, and they will suddenly remember what fiscal conservatives they have always been.
You‚Äôre speaking strictly post-election yeah?
Aw babe

What are the chances that Amazon announces stock split and that causes the opposite of TSLA dilution news?
Now that it‚Äôs reached $35. It definitely can do $45 by June of next year.

This is straight up stock bag holding.
Jeez why spy otm puts still expensive was going to hedge some with my portfolio but shit might get wreck even more
Metal gangggg
bought 31K worth of 40Cs last Friday when they were on sale briefly. Nio is a long game options play.
Anybody else's momentum indicators all out of whack??
That‚Äôs why when IV is high, u sell OTM calls or spreads. Friday, sold a bunch of strangles, all coming in with this crush. Theta! When the time is right.
*Boing, boing, boing*
If we are going up 1.50 is the barrier. The put will decrease in value along with the call increasing. Once broken the growth is exponential.

We're a friendly bunch usually but sometimes the meth gets us
Imagine thinking Amzn at 2999 is a good price

Edit: downvotes! Must have found the call holders
Options are indeed broken.

Like seriously their price is a goddamn paradox. The premium should reflect the likelihood of big dick moves, but their cost of arbitrage is purely how often the price crosses its strike. And in ideal conditions that cost is 0. But then an option can't be worth 0 because there's no chance that the price will remain exactly at strike at expiry. So it's a paradox that rewards sellers bigly.

Being Theta gang is like owning a casino, though nobody will actually tell you how to make money. Covered calls or "cash covered puts" (i.e. actually just naked puts) are actually dumb. You just shift your deltas around but the sum total is the same.

It was actually already worth only $.60 like 2 weeks after I sold it. Retards cut both ways: They'll pay an insane premium, but they'll keep paying it for months, forcing you to wait to expiration to collect it all LOL

The fact that this is still worth $.07 is almost as crazy as when it was worth $1.25.

At 10:35 this morning there was a huge influx of mostly large call orders.   At the exact same time the stock dropped noticeably, but then had a slight rebound.  It almost feels like someone just dropped the price to keep some calls OTM.  I'd love a better explanation if you have one.

Just had this thought. With so many families of early childhood children being raised from isolation at home, the neural development of millions of young children will be stunted in the regions of the brain responsible for social integration.

Dividends stocks typically go down in price after the dividend for exactly that reason.

A $100 stock that gives out a $1 dividend typically trades at $99 the next day, plus or minus whatever market forces affect the price that day.

The easiest explanation for this is that the company no longer has the money in its bank account. Imagine buying a $100 bank account for $100. After you withdraw $1 from it, you can only sell that bank account for $99 because you've instantaneously extracted value. Only if that $99 returns to $100 value could you make profit.

Mutual funds and ETFs also go down after distributions because NAV (and thus  their intrinsic value) goes down as the money leaves the fund.
Isn‚Äôt it true every election it‚Äôs negative -1% so this gonna have to tank soon
this is pissing me off
You had the audacity and good luck to buy the March dip.

You, like almost everyone else, made a fortune trading the big tech stocks. Among those you find your favorite race horse. You win almost every bet on this stock, and buying the dip always works.

One day the market suffers a correction and your positions take a hit. "I'm long term positive on this company, I'll buy the dip and wait" You say.

The day after that you wake up and it's a sea of red. Your favorites are declining over 3%. You say to yourself "Now is the time to go in". The stock keeps declining intraday, but you keep buying the dip, not realizing the huge position size you're building up.

The next day the correction continues. You've wiped out your initial gains and some more. You have no cash to buy any more dips. When the bell rings, your portfolio is utterly broken and so is your spirit.

You go look at futures gaining 0.34% and begin to type furiously on WSB: BEAR R FUK

Hey man baby steps okay
Making money on puts with all this bearishness is easy. Only way you are gonna lose is if you get too greedy. Be sure to secure profits from now and then, nothing sucks more than watching your big play turn into a big loss.

obviously pick whatever loss you're comfortable with, but I usually shoot for 10% down from the most recent peak of my option price.

next significant down day, the stop limit will trigger, you take all that greenery and ride the dip to another entry point, then shovel it back in.

Do I wait til the the blue one wins until I buy NIO or should I make my bet now

I know I know. I've bought LEAPs for NIO at various strikes since it's been $12 and collected my gains. My mistake has been not buying more than 1 or 2 at a time. 

I also have 100 shares i got at $12, but with the way nio moves, covered calls seem risky
[deleted]
They are -99% already, might as well hold through expiration lmao
Aww did you miss out
Really want to buy draft kings but the IV is fucking 89% even for 6 months options woof
Bulls don‚Äôt actually buy this fake pump on no news, right?
I see ok, but selling puts for an extra 10k per month sounds nIce too

Exactly. I put in for a put option for this Friday. It‚Äôs going to tank, but buy in the dip I will. This stock is on fire and it‚Äôs only going to get better for them next year.

Edit: I believe it will drop down to like $25 - $30 after the sell off. It‚Äôs still a safe stock.

Imagine thinking now is the time to start a position on a shitty Chinese EV maker after it moved up 2000 percent in under a year with basically little change in their actual fundamentals to warrant the run up.

I ain‚Äôt selling bruh. F the bears
Yeah, WSJ said most of the recent dip has been rotation into cash. Historically, the best time to buy is when cash holdings are high.
Nio is one of those stocks you just gotta have balls of steel when it comes to the swings

Amzn is sus. When that shit goes down big money knows something. Play safe guys.
Guys. Why would anyone buy this dip a day before elections lmao. Of course that was a bull trap - this is going to be endless selling until tmrw's election is over and onward potentially
lockdowns are bad without stimulus, thats the whole problem right now, republicans got their corporate / stock market bailouts and do not want to bailout poor people

It sure fucking does buddy

I met Shawn Michaels at a restaurant once - we‚Äôd accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, but we‚Äôd like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we‚Äôll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you‚Äôd like while you‚Äôre in town.‚Äù My sister and cousin were both like ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs cool.‚Äù and I kind of played the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôve been here for 15 minutes - we‚Äôve just ordered. Can‚Äôt we finish our meal here?‚Äù Then out of nowhere Shawn Michaels shows up next to the manager and says ‚ÄúPaul, these guys can finish. We‚Äôll be at the bar. I got some time.‚Äù And I (being a big HBK fan) said ‚ÄúOh wow, uh‚Ä¶ I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.‚Äù Shawn was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Shawn Michaels and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.
Hey retard, are you holding for big reward?
Every time I buy calls, shit plummets. Lucky I ain't buying SPY calls üëç

Man, catch the bottom of AMZN and you can make a lot of money quickly but I don't think I can catch it. I'll get cut.

What the fuck is this shit? Trump expects me to vote for him with this dump before the election? I'm voting for change now
Why am I here? Just to suffer?
Fuck you powell do something!!!!!!
AMZN hasn‚Äôt hit it‚Äôs September low yet, I‚Äôm holding out hope.
Sounds like they want to track their assets
So one of the reasons why my early savings dried up, was that I took a soft early age "break" where I didnt work for nearly 2 whole years. I do agree that eventually, without a lot of disposable income to do bigger things, this will get boring. I was even dating someone at the time, someone hot. Staying at home wasn't very healthy for the relationship
Wait. It always goes up I‚Äôm pre market, then some more in the morning. Then drops a dollar or two in the afternoon. Followed by steady climbs back up
And it's godamn freezing

NE here

Just flip for now
I bet that helps...
Ok

Nah i sold at a $15 loss. I can probably make that back in .1 seconds
Market is BLOOD green even with tech stocks shitting the bed. Imagine if tech stocks were also blood green. 

We'd have been up like 5%.
Story of my life
Dang. Sorry dude. I typically don't hold but NIO is something I am holding for at least a year. I suggest finding a good point and doing the same
Held SPY puts for the first 3 weeks of October. Sold my puts the Friday before last week because I was bleeding money. Bought puts again at the end of the week when it looked like a crash had started. Ended up missing the only deep red week of the month. FML.

> hand over fist

The fist is the withdrawal of your closed hand with revenue from the last agreement. The hand is out (and over the fist) to accept earnest money for the next agreement, presumably because others are handing you money so quickly you are hardly able to receive it.

Sitting cash gang right now. But we are doing that thing we‚Äôre we are so focused on a crash could be ignoring a opportunity. Refreshed lockdowns and AMZN is down? Yeah right.

Being perma bear or bull is a recipe for disaster in long run sure you can get lucky and strike it rich but you will lose it all at the end. Best strategy is to adapt based on the data. I feel for all the bears who found that out the hard way today
Which if they were paying attention at all they'd find that Trump is far more likely to take their guns than Biden.

Nah this is the bear trap, this shit is gonna continue pumping for at least today
If you dont know whether to buy puts or calls on something, then you might as well go to a casino. Fuckin calm it and buy something thats dipping like an adult
Last chance to get in on gun stocks before the election!

My favorite is SWBI
Aapl said nah
There is still tons of uncertainty, especially around Congress and SCOTUS decisions. Gun stocks can go sky high still. It's the threat of regulation, not regulation itself, which will probably not even be that urgent, considering the amount of shit Biden will be left to shovel after Mango Messiah is booted.
AMZN bringing the market down with it
bulls were celebrating 27 minutes in.
Reminds you of last Monday's morning pump
Any retards with two thumbs can say "stonks go up" when the market is green but only a true autist will say bullshit and double down on puts.
This market is just bipolar

Fuck Microsoft fuck Apple
Yeah we are gearing for a depression. When the bottom falls out, it will completely shatter considering they destroyed the structure while ripping out all the copper wire.
wipe your ass with that to get some good out of it

poor AMZN, is it a buy sub 3k or is it even gonna get worse after the election?

Fuck Tim Apple
It‚Äôs okay buddy I just put all my money into $35 11/6 nio calls and watching my money tank as we are speaking
Imagine thinking that this will be a smooth election. Even outside of the stock market, you think the talking heads actually want civility? They are going to stoke the fuck out of this fire.
Last week makes it even more likely to trigger.  We got more buy in from institutional investors, which are not paper hands, and we got a TON of short buy in from retail, which is paper hands.  They will squeeze like mad if GME can regain some upward momentum.  Getting back to 15 will be much easier now than it was before, and we're just now approaching the time period that it was originally supposed to start going up.  Happy times ahead
That method allows you to free up serious capital but you miss out on apple gaining value as the years go on.
Oh shit, NIO isn't holding its drink right now. Dumped all the way back to 32.8.
AMAZON AAPL AND ZOOM have gone into the red Lol Nio with retard strength is falling off a cliff and so is tsla lol

When has any of situations built up to be that been that bad so far?
AMZN PT: 2680$
MM out here slaughtering üê∑
Yep although depending on broker you can sell them naked (don't have to buy them) but they usually want to see that you have the capital in the event you must buy 10000 shares of apple.
Trump just responded to the crowds chants, so that's not very reliable. It'd only be if he wins, and it's sitting very unlikely he is able to pull what he did in 2016.
Amazon and Apple about to fuck us. Drill team six you are up. üåàüêª
Amazon under 3k. This is the end times.

Smart man that‚Äôs a great average. I see 15-20 in the near future
I killed NIO.
can anyone tell me what they think of either $C puts or calls? what's going on with them I'm hearing chatter
i agree, i feel i can sense an age gap when people just won't shut the fuck up and let anything just do it's thing.
When will some genius company make options on fractional shares of expensive companies?  Come on, don't tell me it isn't possible.  Would like some AMZN calls except for the fact they cost like $20k.

Yes
its a stronghold at 3000
Depending on the companies stock and volatility will determine premium price. Like pfizer would not be worth it cause even a month out and out of the money the premium price is not worth the hassle since it barely moves and the volume is low.
Target is 40, I think it‚Äôll go down slightly and then climb again
Goodbye AMZN, and thanks for all the puts.

because mm want one last hopium rally to trap retards before dumping it
I shorted literal tons of oil, hoping for another massive crash since more and more places have announced strict lockdowns again. Winter should boost the pandemic, at least in my retard opinion.
Sell now or wait ?
Based on options pricing, expected SPY movement between now and Wednesday is $10.
Ok gotcha. So Imma hold em.
No one gives a shit about brick and mortar
Bad move
If Biden looks to win on the night but Trump in fact wins, expect bigly riots

Bears : this little dip is your last chance offer
I follow smart money so apple is a given. I have a strong feeling the billionaires that own massive amounts of shares and apple aggressively buying back stocks with its near 200 billion dollar cash reserve wont let it fall below 100.

Tesla can easily make you like 100k in premium because of volatility but suddenly its a very real possibility it swings 100 dollars in value for random reasons. Also the volume in apple is massive so people and companies are always buying puts and calls.

Just dump already ffs, this is getting tiresome. Look at all the bad news.
That's...fucking dumb
Honestly I don‚Äôt know. Had 326 calls before the spike eod and sold
Why isn‚Äôt civil unrest really being spoken about as weighing in on markets regardless of outcome? Shops in NYC boarding up. If trump wins no doubt we will see the same as before, some protests and shit, but if Biden wins clear I mean wtf could go down?

They‚Äôre all wiping out call/put option buyers.

I think you meant to say hoarder/prepper fudds and people like my dad's hysterical email list of college buddies from the 70s who heard about an ammo shortage and flocked to it like sheep to buy up 50k rounds for the one AR that has been gathering dust in their closet since the late 90s. People who don't train and are probably sitting on ammo stockpiles in the six figures cause they buy bricks during every panic but never go shooting.

New gun owners are part of the problem because they don't know what good prices are so they're willing to pay clown prices, but the above group is the bulk of the problem.
I‚Äôm looking at reentry - but I have no clue what the whole market will be doing this week
that aged poorly
Puts are getting crowded out today. I have a feeling election might not be as contested as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù think and we‚Äôll get a massive IV crush.

That show is still relevant after more than 20 years of being over.

Now someone put Trumps head on Elaine dancing.

I thought no guidance was bad. Why LL up?
yeah me too, but gaming space will definitely get a boost with Playstation & Xbox releases. I still think calls while it's sub $80 are a good play
Looks like SPY reversal starting, so preparexfor next leg up
Every time TSLA is below 400 I buy weekly calls and make money. It's too close to the threshold
Bulls roll out the red carpet for substandard pussy
Whoever loses will contest. According to a Reddit headline for an article I didn‚Äôt read Biden has 4000 lawyers ready to contest if it‚Äôs close enough. Trump will cry and say it‚Äôs rigged if he loses and fight it anyway he can.

Man that's bullshit my brokeragelink won't let me buy stocks. I can buy fucking 5x leveraged etfs but individual stocks are TOO RISKY.

So i had 500 bucks laying around and thought, let me try out this robinhood thing....

Bought Tesla 10/30 $385 puts on 10/29 for like nothing, Tesla just happened to dip to like $384 and i tripled my money.

Now i rolled it into MSFT $255 2/19/21 calls and will sit on them until they expire.

If Microsoft hits like $280 before 2/19/21 I will be the dumbest motherfucker to ever make a significant amount of money playing stonks.

Might take a few days after Election Day because they have to count mail in ballots and they won‚Äôt all be in for a few days. Trump is trying to say these ballots shouldn‚Äôt be counted but let‚Äôs be real, all votes need to be counted. I know PA and NC(my state) are accepting mail in ballots a few days late. Not sure why people couldn‚Äôt do it earlier but their votes should still matter
Fine, those are almost always institutional hedges

well he just got 60% shaved off
Well if you‚Äôre just showing up to work you probably do 20k a month, and if you hustle you can do up to 200 in a month. I know it‚Äôs not a good thing- it‚Äôs a feast or famine industry, right now it‚Äôs a feast. I literally said we‚Äôre in a boom right now. Those numbers are absolutely not typical without a crazy rate environment though
The gay bear awaits his freshly printed new comment  to pounced with the downvote. This strategy while ineffective is funny for the chad bull who is about to feast
Imagine being so upset that your retarded moves lost you money so you spend all your time downvoting people on a fucking internet forum.

Mathematically speaking tech is your best bet to buy.

Down slightly. Bush v Gore fucked the markets though so if it's contested I expect a big dip.

But I also sold 30$ covered calls for NIO so inverse me cause I'm dumb
Anyone watching google, looks ready to break out

Wonder how the person who dropped 3.8M EOD friday on 11/4 SPY 290p is doing today.

EDIT: 

Here was the link I found this from:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jlldo3/60000\_spy\_290\_puts\_114/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jlldo3/60000_spy_290_puts_114/)
There‚Äôs enough head for everyone.
Interesting. Why not options instead? Timing isn‚Äôt certain?
Need a cheap yolo!
May his leaving tank the market.
cash out!
Last week the market was terrified of the virus, election uncertainties, fading of stimulus and European shutdowns but it's all priced in now. We'll rally higher from here.
I simply shouldnt have been a lil bitch and just bought some on Friday. I think it has some room to go, someone said ER is 11/17 so no worries for now.
I bought puts.... spxs puts!
This is the way, definitely. I'm going to load up on Dec 18th 35c or 40c when I get more available cash. Earnings is coming up soon.

The thing I have learned from two miserable months of trying to "time" NIO is that you fucking can't. It will pick any day and just do 15%. You MUST take the "time in the market" approach to NIO. Get 2+ month out calls and hold onto them.
Why hasn‚Äôt he leveraged a second basket is what I‚Äôm asking?

How could they possibly know? Early votes won't entirely be counted for a while.
Weedstocks was the same.  A few people did the math and it basically looked like, at the peak, that every single weed co was poised to take 100% of the market or that every person was going to start buying an 1/8 a day for some reason.  Cue crash.

You might know before you go to sleep tomorrow...before market Wednesday
They are panic buying AR style guns because of the Biden video saying  we are coming for them" in a video where he is eating at Whataburger with Beto, in efforts to have them grandfathered in before he has a chance to outlaw them.

There was some controversy as to what he meant to say, because why not. He either says, "We are coming for them" (outlaw guns) or "We are coming for 'em" (Hiring Beto on cabinet) Either way its not good for the second amendment.

[https://www.statesman.com/news/20200314/fact-check-does-video-show-joe-biden-threatening-to-take-guns](https://www.statesman.com/news/20200314/fact-check-does-video-show-joe-biden-threatening-to-take-guns)
No one is going to "riot" if Trump wins fairly. City folk are not the gun crowd. However, if Biden wins, expect the macho men wannabes in camouflage flaming out in a spectacular fashion.
AMZN 3k baby ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

Good, because I sold short Iron Condors!

So the market has to move above the strike of the calls I sold, or the market has to move below the strike of the puts I sold or else I make money.

There's no way you can make any money on SPY puts with anything less than a worst case contested election.  Premium too high.

I need an asteroid the size of New York City to hit the planet right fucking now
Yesterday when futures opened -0.7%, bears were running victory laps. Now they are all dead.
Lets say you have 250k in apple. You are bullish it will go higher so you sell put options to people, these people think it will go down. The worst case is buying stock at a higher price than it is worth. But you are holding those stocks so having more shouldn't be an issue. 

Lets say you sell 100  put contracts at a strike price of 100 dollars that expire in Dec 4th. You will collect 20k in premium and walk away with profit assuming apple does not go below 100 in a months time. Very unlikely so you could just sit back and collect these premium from foolish people.
These are way out of the money and unlikely to hit so all your doing once a month is colleting 20k in options premium.
Can‚Äôt wait for your post later today saying ‚Äúomg I sold my spy puts for -98% loss and now they‚Äôre up 2000%!!!‚Äù

Yea Im waiting. Puts only til Wednesday
Sorry bro
So - for transparency. I am in 31K worth (now 41K+ worth) of 40Cs for May. That is just how I kind of roll though.

Honestly with NIO? You have some options, you can hope for a dip before earnings, buy Nov 20's or Decembers, and sell right before earnings (I am afraid of IV crush)

You can buy longer dated calls (Jan or later) with a 40C or more and hope for minimal IV crush and solid movement. Have an exit plan on when you will take profit. So if you say hit 100% then sell and depending on when that happens you can look for another entry point.

Currently - NIO is having solid jumps, then will consolidate and fall as the market falls. So when it first pumped from 21 to 29, it fell back down to 26 on general market down turn before another upgrade.

Earnings is 17 November AMC. Best of luck. Take my advice with a grain of salt, do your own due diligence, don't just blindly listen to me.
end of week predictions?
IMO you should‚Äôve sold when you were up 5%.

Look, if you have to ask then do more research elsewhere before you get eaten alive.
The boys are indeed, back in town.
my plan today was to buy a few hundred shares of NIO and sell some weekly CCs.  Never got a chance, went all in with 35c 11/20s instead.  This is the way.
Maybe I caught a dip into NIO. Maybe I didn't kill NIO since I only bought one cheap call for it.

So not only was I completely correct about NIO, I wasn't fucking in it when it pumped. That's TWICE now I haven't been in it when it hit its pump day. Fuck my stupid idiot hands.

From now on I'm just buying a month and a half or two+ out and holding.

LOL at the market going up after this entire sub was screaming about Puts all weekend
It is. Under normal circumstances I would pull out. GME isn't normal circumstances. It could either be the turn around of the year or the biggest flop. Management seems to be giving a shit and putting in effort this time around.
Just took the biggest shit of my life. Easily 3-4 pounds. This is a sign.

You will drive yourself crazy looking at the options fluctuate. It took me a while to just buy it and check back in a couple hours. Keep in mind the worst that can happen is flat for 5 hours. This is decrease the value by 10% or so. You can hold for the volume to come back in the afternoon or sell and re enter another day (Monday, Wednesday or Friday). 

I cannot tell you the amount of times in the beginning when i was nervous looking at the balance jump +-5% then check back and find it back at a cool 20% gain. Mondays especially have been 50-100% gains by afternoon majority of the time.

What is "huge" to you? A couple of thousand dollars? If so, do it. That's not real money. You're not changing your life over that. You won't even qualify for bankruptcy for that.  


Are you talking about YOLOing $200,000? That's what takes real balls.
If that is the case buy some SPX debit spreads for about$20 each and turn that into $500 for each spread

What I meant :p
A pump today was expected by me tbh. But if it pumps literally all day, I will admit (for the thousandth time) that I well and truly have zero idea what I am doing
All these bears are acting like we're going to get black swan price action from this election and the lockdowns but it's not a black swan if we already fucking know about it. Not saying we might not continue seeing the downtrend correction but March likely ain't happening again. And if it does, it won't be when you monkeys expect it.
Why? Why do you think it will go down, considering its usage has been increasing in the last 6 months?
What‚Äôs my next play?

the issue is this is an asymptomatic virus. many of the cases have no symptoms. plenty of people go out without masks because they think they are not a risk, when in reality yes, they are spreading it. you don't need to sneeze in someone's face to spread it, just talking close could be enough. 


why does it matter that wearing a mask does not prevent you from getting it? you realize that if everyone is required to wear masks that means the people who have it will be wearing them, preventing them from spreading it???
Havent heard of it in a long time hahah

I'm going to incorporate my own "blank check" company. Our ticker will be JIZZ if you guys want in on the ground floor let me know.
wow 11/4 spy puts are so expensive
It‚Äôs because their shipping costs increased by 5 billion yoy
Blowout earnings, obviously.
The explanations I've heard basically all amount to "nowhere to go now but down"
I‚Äôm saying for the past 2 weeks
Some people love to sell low and buy high, those are not perma bulls, and they hate their money.
How the fk is spy up almost 5 points. And why the fk does it go up right when I buy puts. I am so fked.
Somebody tell AMZN the Rona is roaring back...
QUICK. PERFORM TECHNICAL ANALYSIS ON TVIX
Good bet it will.  Earnings next Tuesday.

Thank you .
Yes, it usually takes a day.

What I'm saying is if you're waiting for warrant redemption to drop the price, it'll go up before then on the Q3 call, based on contracts and projections. After that, get out, wait for the warrant redemption, then get it again.
Remember the days where Tesla would just run all day? Now it pumps a little and just sells off

Good ole pump n dump

Already in NIO massively. Originally bought 500 shares @18 but sold around 21 because i am retarded and impatient. Bought back in immediately after price target increase and have been eating tendies since.

Shit just keep smooning lol I love it

Yeah I‚Äôm not jumping in now. Stupid phone call.

How are people still shocked we are going down, you should be shocked we are green
(\*)
Right. Masks prevent you from spreading it, they aren't designed to prevent you from getting it.

If you don't have covid wearing a mask isn't doing anything unless someone is actively yelling or sneezing in your face.

So again, you have no answer as to what trump could do to stop the spread. People like you spread bullshit that if trump wasn't president we wouldn't have so many cases. Lol ok right.
Because they did so well on their earnings
NIO has set records of high volume trade and double the amount of cars delivered. The next earnings report should be interesting
Fuck didn‚Äôt notice NIO almost hit 35
yeah i switched to inverse etf for the week/puts on smaller price per share stocks like NIO or ford or twit
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long.
I know and I can‚Äôt tell but I‚Äôm feeling it‚Äôs the index‚Äôs.

Just deposited more money for this after election pump/dump. Am I autistic? Probably, is there a fire sale on right now? Most likely. Do I know what I am doing? Absolutely not. 1000 dollar plays for after the election?

Down so much on this. Bag holding my calls waiting for it to find some fuel
Maybe shoulda waited a day or 2 to buy nio..

Why is AMZN tanking??? They literally have an monopoly... the only competition is the US government

If you break even every month it's probably still a win.

It's the equity you gain from having the rent pay the mortgage. Those properties essentially become funds you can tap at most any time with a HELOC or refinance.

Obviously if the market blows up, you get fucked, but over a _long_ period of time property is generally a good investment.
Anybody else have the luck where if you buy any option, if it doesn‚Äôt instantly go the direction you want you are fuk?

The stock markets only gives a fraction of fucks about who the president is... face it, if Biden wins, there‚Äôs not going to be four years of crashing.... Mango has created the illusion that he is the sole reason the markets rally when that‚Äôs simply not true
From my past year of trading I can say with 99% confidence that the market will only move in the opposite direction of my positions. I‚Äôm thinking how much I should be charging for revealing my positions because I have lost so much money that I probably won‚Äôt finically recover for at least 5 generations
I'll buy puts when this shit hits 340 tmrw üòÇ

Hella people I talked to were voting yes bc those ads.
I think it‚Äôs a pretty even chance. If I HAD to guess I‚Äôd say Biden will at least win popular vote but Trump might win electoral college. Either way we‚Äôre gonna see some serious civil unrest. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm counting on. Doesn‚Äôt really matter who wins Bc they‚Äôre both shmucks and both bad for the people of the US. These elections have PUT us in a bad situation

Really appreciate this. Just opened my first straddle 15 mins ago. SPY went up $1 but it‚Äôs weird be used my call is still worth less than my put. I‚Äôll see how they‚Äôre looking later though. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get the hang of it too

Off of those ridiculous bronco preorders. This stock has outpaced TSLA on the weekly monthly and 6 month charts. With a fat dividend too. Probably the best current boomer stock to have.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT?
You mean after a 2.2 trillion dollar stimulus package was passed in late march? Or when the fed started buying bonds and MBS at an insane speed?
Manufacturing PMI/ISM big beat
Let‚Äôs see tomorrow

Ah okay, yeah I think anything under $20 is a great deal long term. It has a tendency to pop suddenly, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we‚Äôre back in the $22-$23 range mid-month
You'll be too late. I firmly believe this'll go up before Nov 12, and warrants will be redeemed after that rise, bringing the price down again.   


Warrants haven't even been called yet, they just filed the paperwork last week, SEC is gonna take  time.
Anyone else think we won't see an actual dip this week?
Honestly bulls you deserve a win. I‚Äôll give you until 12 o‚Äôclock and then I‚Äôll be feeding you red dildos all week long. Sound good?

Yes. They have [a power train selling now](https://www.hyliion.com/hybrid-cng/) (like a retrofit) that's in a few trucks. Their bread and butter will likely be [the Hypertruck ERX](https://www.hyliion.com/erx-page/) which is being prototyped by a few fleets and has over 2 million miles logged. Volume production enters next year. Contracts and pre-orders already accepted.
If Trump wins, buy EV and green energy stocks

If Biden wins, buy defense stocks

They're both still going to be winners in the long run, but people will be dumb and panic sell lowering the price.

I'm in on 11/6 VXX 25C

150 calls are a terrible play, but the 125s might be a decent call. Either way I would get rid of both of them on the next big pop. Neither will be in the money come expiration.

You basically wait until 10-11 for an accurate depiction of what the market will do the rest of the day rather than get cucked at open when no one knows what will happen. In short you wait to make any significant moves until 10-11.
This is the way. Worthless expiration.
Now that you all have abandoned your puts...
Gees what a fantasy
My 2c is that gold tanks as well if there's a scary liquidation event a la mid-March... won't offer much protection vs. the dollar. It's more of a long-term hold.

CNBC is still going with their story of the market wants stimulus and therefore favors Biden. I guess the idea is that mega stimulus benefits would outweigh any tax increases.

I'm not so sure though. Having a real hard time figuring out how market would react to X outcome. Other than a decisive win for either side removing uncertainty. I don't think anyone *really* fucking knows how to play this one.

However I *do* know how to play a pandemic breaking records every week. And that is with puts.
I judge market conditions based on how many Beckys and Barrys are in line at the local Starbucks drive thrus in their Ugg Boot edition Audis and Porsches. Line was around the block this morning. We've only started this moon mission.

TDOC is a massive piece of shit, it‚Äôs down $40 since mid last week and still bleeding
Still haven't said what he could do to prevent more cases. 

The answer is nothing. The virus is going to run its course until we either have heard immunity or a vaccine. No social distancing or mask wearing is going to prevent that. The only reason we did social distancing and lock down in the first place was to flatten the curve so hospitals are overwhelmed. We did that.

Seriously on the NIO pattern though - did this exact same shit on the last explosion, just moved up gradually throughout the day

Big Volume so fart today
Ah gotcha. Did not realize that.
I've been buying shares. Its a good company that will be utilized more and more once the broke millenials start making money and buying houses. Could take a couple years but i just don't see it getting much lower than IPO price
If u sell before close tomorrow you won't get your nuts crushed in an IV Vise grip

EA looks like its gonna dump
Thank you kind sir
I noticed the premium I receive when I sell puts is considered ‚Äúbrokerage cash‚Äù must this settle before I can use it even in RH?
330 bear trap so obviously teasing
why invest in fast mortages when you can invest in literal rockets headed to SPCE!?!?!
It won't dump until tomorrow. It's going to be propped up today. Can't have a big-red dildo day the day before the election, BRRRRRRR

not even worth buying anything
Saame
Reluctantly crouched at the starting line Engines pumping and thumping in time
Easy get 100k
I know what I‚Äôm talking about, the volume was too high and vix was high so prices were high. As you can see even with a 1% rise. 3dte are only up 30%. Normally that would easily be 50%.
What will Nio end the week at?

Think we might see a pull back?
Sooo glad I went cash. Bought a Lexus with my meme money calls on my insurance rates
NIO not giving up those gains without a fight.
I have puts but dont worry its already back up lol
Bear trap
Hmm i sold for kind of too cheap, I blame robinhood for being so slow at open. I‚Äôm not sure if it was the right call though, I guess time will tell.. it‚Äôs already higher now then for what I ended up selling, but we‚Äôll see what happens today
I am up +$100.000,00.. Oh shoot thats Tesla..

Hey! EVERYBODY! One of the half dozen predictions I've made in the past couple days has come true. That's like a .166 batting average which is AWESOME for an American league pitcher batting in the National League. So all of you can SUCK. MY. BALLS.
Looks like I buy puts at close and calls at open huh. 

If I had any money left
Buying a pit for this week is pretty retarded cuz of premiums, right?

my TSN, LHX, and VRTX plays are doing well...but TDOC falling is little surprising. 

I guess it has to do with TDOC investors selling to raise cash to put into other stonks.
Everything begins somewhere. Don't be dumb.
very happy i didn't load up on puts now
by not taking out a loan to invest.

Dont finance a trade
Day trades that happen when you're above cap don't count.  You're only capped on day trades below the cap.

So you‚Äôre up?
Yes saw that.  I find it odd that Li Auto is still selling more cars than Xpeng though.  Feels like Xpeng with the entry priced cars and multiple models should be outselling Li Auto with their one luxury model (not even pure EV, uses a small ICE motor to recharge the tiny battery).  All else aside, Chinese EV market is just killing it.
Like INSANE, I‚Äôm out for the moment, really easy to get burned with these prices

Ok, think I‚Äôm out for the week. Sold my spy puts at the bottom Friday, bought a bunch of spy calls Friday afternoon (340c like 11/20 or so) and sold them at market open today for like 140% profit

I‚Äôve made my money, can‚Äôt keep getting lucky on hunches in this market
Now would be a good time
Me too.....
This is going to end up flat on the day - bull trap
Don‚Äôt sell puts guys, not until Wednesday.

Though theta will eat the premiums up. Guh
This has been happening the whole year. Can‚Äôt trust anything, we‚Äôre losing touch with reality damnit.

After today everything changes. You have become used to a system, a pattern, a dance that seems almost organic. Politics aside, the way the world is run will be changing at the beginning of next year, and I know some of you Yung Studz are only used to one way of doing things. Just sit back and watch. Just as an earthquake can change the course of the river, a paradigm shift like this may urge the tendies to flow in a different direction.

Because you went long because you weren't sure when the spike was going to happen. It happened a week ago. Sitting on a stock after it gets squirted up 100% is fucking nonsense. Sell now.
this backfired
so how does this work? in 430 something billion other worlds there will be a dead guy who disproved the 'many worlds' interpretation? But in one reality it will be you? Or, will you emerge with the winning ticket in every reality and just be conscious of one random one?

What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

R.I.P. half this sub again this week ü§£. I wonder if we could create a WSB ETF ü§î
No
The only reasons I agree with this are two reasons:

1. Couple weeks ago I tried short selling stock when it was up 16% in a day, and it kept going and going and going. I covered for a loss.

2. Not too long ago, sold all my calls at open when it was up 6% pre market. It kept going and going and going until it was like 14%.

Bonus third: it‚Äôs a Chinese company, so it‚Äôs not operating under American norms. China is going to boost the fuck out of it.
Im thinking the same thing

I was just stating a fact from past elections - gun stocks rose sharply as soon as Obama was elected (and again for his 2nd term) and dived when Trump won because there wasn't any panic buying.

However- I would agree gun companies are probably a safe bet right now regardless of the outcome on Nov 3rd based on how divided and angry everyone is right now

I think so, too. Seems like they're dissecting all factors in the EV market and will use their early opening strength to capitalize on it.  If they wait for the sweet spot/moment to go into EU and US, they're gonna slay even more.  TSLA won't be the only recognizable name in EV for long imo.

I saw somewhere else, but Tesla has very strong ties to the leaders of China, apparently more so than NIO. Even thought NIO is a chinese company, Tesla has a very strong foothold with officials.

Greed bro. Why have spys and an expensive ass military research when your enemies will just hand you all their secrets for a couple of billion a year in labor?
This is the way
Disagree.  The policy holder may not be worth the strike price (life insurance value) at death.  Calls and Puts relate to the underlying value of an item at a specific point in time.  A person with no assets or job can buy a million dollar policy on him/herself but that doesn‚Äôt mean he/she has an underlying value of a million dollars.
do I dare play the pre-election market with no day trades left
Ok random person.
Amen brother

Italian management is shit, they outsource to the Germans or the nearest, hottest person
Yes, forget about the fact that we practically pump-and-dumped that stock at one point, and instead just put all your money into calls for that exact same stock, because it definitely won‚Äôt happen again. Great financial advice.

When we call ourselves ‚Äúautists‚Äù or ‚Äúretards‚Äù, we‚Äôre somewhat joking, but mainly warning you. This subreddit is every professional financial advisor‚Äôs nightmare. What actual Wall Street experts would never even consider doing in a million years is what this subreddit does every day. It really is like gambling often times, just on a way higher scale.

"Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO (NYSE: NIO) delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, up 100.1% year-on-year, and marking the eighth consecutive month of year-on-year growth."  Do you think CCP is going to let TSLA capture the majority of it's EV market long term? No chance. This thing was 2$ in April.. get in
anyone thing the banks are going up?
Yeah man, for sure.

Never mind the gargantuan negative cash flow and multiple instances of imminent bankruptcy the past couple of years.

NIO is solid as a rock, only falls when the rest of the market does.

Nice.

I've done ok with it here and there.  But I've learned to go as long as possible with it.  Seems they always come under anti-trust or some scrutiny all the time but it seems to always bounce back.  Gotta hold through the BS or average down when it happens.

imagine thinking it will hold
A hedge for a black swan event probably
I've never even seen 1k let alone gamble with it lmfao
The premium you pay for that call is essentially an engagement ring and and half of your asset :/
Hopefully that‚Äôs all it will be down

Always inverse the sub
SPY....... last week someone bought almost $4M worth of 290p for 11/4 at $0.63 and 0.06 delta. ?????
You honestly right though
Mm maybe I can try to jump in today but they did most of the move probably
Think we could get in nio below 34 today?
Yes lol
let me write something random here edit it one week from now and type in the new thread "I CALLED IT !!111!!1 SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO ME LOSERS"
Turns out, this was a great move
No I get that the mean and standard deviation is derived from historical moves. 

But why am I calculating the mean and standard deviation off expected moves? It‚Äôs a derivative of a derivative innit? I should be comparing last week‚Äôs change against the historical weekly actual performance to determine the sigma move innit?

Ok, be honest with me here. When you see a company up 65% in a month, is your instinctual reaction to hope on board or go inverse w/ puts. 

Edit: I mean instinctual jerk reaction, clearly it depends on a lot of actual things...
Until we hit an actual recession.
ü•≠ wins = free money for corporations = stonks go up.

 üò¥ wins = no ü•≠ tweets after Jan = stability = stonks go up.

I was expecting to see a dip today, but NIO is ‚Äúdown 4% (gasp!)‚Äù after being up 12% (wtf?) in pre market hours.

You don‚Äôt know what you are ya about
That‚Äôs for income not capital loss or gains
I think that‚Äôs exactly how expected move or 1 standard deviation is calculated. It takes into account historical moves and volatility. And this is what determines the price of options.

True!
I think the persons who want to follow you would prefer a Twitter profile.  

PS: twitter profile that's pure trading / TA-wise and not politics (As you have at the moment).
They literally tried to force a campaign bus off the interstate the other day. Finish this sentence: ‚Äúafter supporters of President Duarte forced the bus to a halt ...‚Äù

Nothing good happens at the end of that sentence. Using multi-ton vehicles to harass people is absolutely a form of violence in and of itself. But nothing non-violent awaits after forcing a political target off the road.

Trump supporters also blocked a highway in New Jersey this weekend, apparently just for the hell of it.
Fucking FB.  Ton of upgrades way OTM right now and shit drops like a retard.  It was up like $3 pm when I checked earlier.

Why are we calculating sigma using expected moves when our baseline of observation is the actual outcome? 

Should we compare the weekly returns across a time horizon to determine if last week was indeed a 3-sigma event?

FI/RE is great if you have the discipline and fortitude to sacrifice your early years working, but odds are if you're that driven to begin with, you'll be bored to tears by "Retirement" and end up going back to some kind of work, paid or not, at some point just to have something to do. 

Being happy 100% of the time means you feel happy about 60% of the time, and it costs a lot more than actually being happy about 50% of the time. Once you adapt to the new normal, you start taking things for granted really quickly, and then lifestyle-creep sets in.

Sir, this isn't a Barnes and Nobles.
If you want a short squeeze play, just look at GME. When OSTK squeezes earlier this year, there was roughly 60% short. GME is at 164% short as of October 15. There hasn‚Äôt been nearly enough volume to cover those shares. Any kind of news and it explodes.

What I'm keeping eyes on this week: the support line since the 10/2 selloff which has now been a resistance the past 3 days > watching for 3 different scenarios 1) the bullish scenario = prices break thru resistance side and then retest/bounce off the support side for a new uptrend 2) the bullish/bearish/bullish scenario = prices break thru the resistance side and retest but doesn't really bounce and trends up/down/sideways on the support side in which case there's still a chance for a bullish move 3) bearish scenario = price continues to get rejected off the resistance side and continues downtrend (need confirmation candles tho for continued strong downward pressure) > super important right now to pay attention to the daily candle formations (price action)

Thank you
Need $AAPL to go over $114 today to make me sell a covered call.

Need $TNA to go over $37.50 today to make me sell covered calls and maybe a cash-secured put.

Still, I think I shouldn‚Äôt sell-to-open any positions until Wednesday.

Sweet summer child. Bless your heart.
Nio did this two weeks ago, had two days of 10 percent runs and then dropped 3-5% and held that range for two weeks. IDK if the same thing will happen again but seems like they released that there october numbers increased 100% and that might be the reason for this continued run
Few miles back.

You mean your ex-girlfriend?

The best way to test your gf is to appear one day to have lost all your money and ask her to lend money tk you. And you need to make her believe that one of your family member has disease that need a big surgery so you need to work two jobs. You than see her less often, from several times per day to once every other weeks.

If she stayed with you after 3 months and your bet is successful, then you can claim you have an uncle lived in foreign country that passed away and give you the inheritance so not only could you pay your family‚Äôs bill but you want to marry her.
You got suckered into the square trap
Nio day in January/December as well as their ER coming up, but up to you

Finna pay my girl debt
Keanu Reeves buys Nio calls... do you?
I feel you, the world has felt very orchestrated and fake this year. But Trump would need to outperform in just about every contested state and that's the least likely of all scenarios. Large bloc of the right (outside of his "base") absolutely can not stand him and will be voting Biden or Libertarian. Almost all of the left is united behind "Jesus christ get this man the fuck out of office." Polling had been improved since last time after learning from their 2016 errors, and the margins are even bigger than last time. I will literally eat my underwear if Mango wins.
I enter at open exit at 12 or 1pm. Mondays have always been massive movements so i hold till 1pm.
Eh I‚Äôm new to this so I don‚Äôt think I could give you a correct answer, but I would guess you‚Äôd want to do a couple weeks out to make sure you‚Äôre still getting enough credit from the extrinsic value. If you‚Äôve got plenty of capital, I would just let them get called away and then switch to cash secured puts. The share price will come back down eventually, maybe even sooner than later, and you‚Äôll get the shares back.
Calls on fuckery over ballots from the losing party for at least a month
KRAMER SAID people bidding the futures up don‚Äôt have any idea what they‚Äôre doing!! He says It‚Äôs too high.. KRAMER SAID
Buy weeklies on something affected by negative buyer sentiment. $FB is jittery before the election, but it‚Äôs absolutely the most undervalued FAANG and you could get rightly crushed when investors come out from cover after the election.

bro the numbers are FUCKING CRAZY, for every $1 lost, $2 was printed in its place

Ottawa gave families affected by the virus more than twice the amount of money the bug cost them. ‚ÄúOverall, Canadian households received more money ($56 billion) from government aid programs such as CERB and other transfers in the second quarter than they lost in wages and salaries due to the pandemic ($23 billion).‚Äù

Wow. In the middle of a pandemic recession, household income actually rose ‚Äì by a huge 11% ‚Äì because of government largess. That made making mortgage payments a whole lot better. It helped create what‚Äôs being called a ‚Äúboom in the gloom.‚Äù
Congrats!
not really, but theres a chance I guess
Turn it off and on again.

I‚Äôve been selling weekly poor mans covered calls on my 2022 nio leaps for the past few weeks and I always seem to have to buy back the option I sell for more. At this point is it better for me to just buy otm calls and ride the wave up? Will otm calls make more money than my itm leaps if the stock keeps going up at this rate or should I stay with my itm leaps and keep selling calls
if you're buying calls today give me karma

It's year 2025, it's the next election, and we are finally hoping to get rid of Donald Trump once and for all. You think back to 2020, you think about the market, and you get really upset. Are you upset cause you didn't time the bullrun, are you upset cause you didn't sell before such an obvious drop. No, you are upset cause the EV giant "NIO" with a 400B market cap, spreading quickly throughout Asia, you saw that stock every day getting shilled, it was sitting on a puny sub 50B market cap. You think to yourself 'Why didn't I buy?, it was so obvious, an EV supported by the chinese Governement, in a country desperate for environmental friendly alternatives'. A tear falls down from your eyes while you go get a bud light in the fridge and once again open the daily WSB thread, hoping that one day you'll be financially secure.
I have spoken
Seems like you should apply "more traders lose money" rule here
<3
I'm not, they just aren't part of the conversation right now.  Dig this:  


[https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility)

" In simple terms, IV is determined by the current price of option contracts on a particular stock or future. It is represented as a percentage that indicates the annualized expected one [standard deviation](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/standard-deviation) range for the stock based on the option prices. For example, an IV of 25% on a $200 stock would represent a one standard deviation range of $50 over the next year. "

&#x200B;

Go read Options Volatility and Pricing for a more in-depth look at how all of that stuff works.  It's a tough read (for me it was), but there are are gems in there.
so NIO puts when? this entire sub is shilling it.. surely it will drop just like everything fucking else WSB briefly got a wild chubby about

Theta will obliterate the value of your straddle by 50% before any change in spy even takes effect.
Nios market cap makes sense:
They make 5000 cars and has half of the market cap of a company with over 10000 airplanes in service
Simple math boys
Things were down, therefore, they can only go up because.

It's going to be huge.

Probably the cheating comment. He's shown the desire, but I'm not going to worry about it until it happens. It would require massive preparation, coordination, and secrecy. Not this administrations strongest trait.
No answer yet. Am I going to have to resort to urban dictionary and have hr involved again!
The best piece of advice from green autists like me: do not ever bet on futures.
Yessir
It‚Äôs pretty sad watching Apple get caught between US and China. I think the pain is just beginning with Chinese consumers voting with their wallets.
I had the same question. I think it‚Äôs daylight savings??
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get a clear winner by tomorrow I‚Äôll be honest.
Wasn't it just like 24 hours ago bears were saying people were retarded if they bought calls on Friday?
Yeah but how the fuck am I supposed to know u don‚Äôt know that I don‚Äôt know that u live on an island ur such a fucking idiot bro

funny, people here were thinking that last friday too
This, now
Woah nio wtf thats insanse
I think that particular answer was more relevant for 2016 elections. This time around, perhaps more people somewhat realise the real life damage, incompetent person in lead of America can actually cause, all the way from economic to the health and lives of people.
And how would u explain why the market is still closed to those morons

I wonder how many spy puts gonna get shakes out today to only regret it Wednesday

Apple should be at least at 120. change my mind
Options are just insurance that goes both ways. I wouldn‚Äôt buy calls on my car, but I‚Äôve got full coverage puts against it.
Considering shares but leaps would bring more gainz
it rocks here. It was getting dark at 4:45. It's nice to have the sun for an extra hour at night, before winter sets in for real and we wave gbye til march.
Soo stonks go up again?
Is that bad? Idk what a deferral program is
I myself hold currently 29 different assets between my local market and us market, but I have some positions with much larger position size than others (some holdings are like 16-20% others 1-3%)

Goddamn I forget luxury items don‚Äôt get good interest rates. And yeah for that type of work it makes sense to buy one. I interviewed with with a road builder out of school about 10 years ago that was in the Permian Basin. The guy hiring me said his wife lived back in Dallas and he just bought a little travel trailer to stay in during the week because he wasn‚Äôt making oilfield money and even in Andrews, Texas apartments were going to $1200/month for 600SF. Glad I dodged that bullet. 

Hopefully y‚Äôall can get something for it when it comes time to sell.

Bro, the market is going to open basically 1% up. Where have you been all weekend as us degenerates argued back and forth about fucking futures?!?
Uhhhh am I missing something?
Less than 100 :)

Deferral programs would only reflect the last 6 months. But to go from anywhere to 100% is a lot. 

But just remember you get 120 days and then it comes due going into more lockdowns.

Biden wants to force people to register their firearms and magazines to a database at $200 for each gun and magazine. It's on his website.

I don't think gun stocks will pop that much because people don't want to buy a gun and then throw down $600 more on registration.

You can't even tell the difference between "has never happened" and some bullshit a politician has no intentions on following through on at some indeterminate point in the future, so maybe you shouldn't call other people retarded, or pretend to understand when something is unconstitutional.

Flair checks out
Well I think the overwhelming sentiment, is the majority of people are dissatisfied with career politicians in general. I think that trump, while bombastic and aloof, resonates with many Americans especially the working class. Now in terms of accomplishments over the past years, that list would be too long to type out. 

The election was meant to be a referendum on trump, however since aligning with radical leftist Kamala, I believe many people were turned off by the dem ticket.
Diversifying lowers your returns and makes it more market-like. Which for most people is ok since they make bad bets, but for those aiming for 10x more their current portfolio it is a bad strat
I suggest 18/12 or 15/01 cause they have new models coming in January among other things

Yea I agree. Only reason we got one is the wife is working a pipeline job and a camper is less expensive than an apartment plus easier to follow the work.  I would say it‚Äôs more expensive because boats are ok wktb water, campers roofs fail with no upkeep after like 2 years and once it‚Äôs moldy inside... there is no coming back. 

Other than that, yea it‚Äôs a money hole. The loan officer even said y‚Äôall know this isn‚Äôt an investment but a money hole.

What‚Äôs crazy is they offered us a 280 month loan at 5.1% ‚Äúwhich is amazing for our age according to them‚Äù on a 72k camper.   That‚Äôs 41k in interest if we make the bare minimum.... which I can‚Äôt believe anyone would do that.

Its gonna go down some, but probably not much. It has earnings coming up the day after elections, so any downward movement due to elections will be muted, and any upward movement will be accelerated.

If I had to make a guess, i'd say 305 EOD today, 302 at open tomorrow, 315 by Nov 5th pre-market.
What we doing today
There is not a single person in this country that can't use the postal system in 2020. Quit spreading fake news.

Remember fellas to get ready for COVID round 2, central bankers are going to FUCK the middle class this winter, get ready to be showered with cash and load up on calls sometime this month when fed bailout round 2 begins :)

Who else forgot about the clock :D?
Market not open yet?
novemBOAR don't even worry about it B)
Seriously - NIO is about to be the new 'it' stock of 2021. "blah blah blah" fundamentals. Doesn't matter when the boomers and late movers start fomoing in.
Time change
Who cares?
no seriously

what do you think odds of us dumping at open are?
It is true - your contracts will go to 0.01 because of your retarded positioning, there will be a bit of a reversal the next day, and then the calls will go to 0.03 for 200% gains! But you won't sell because you're a real autist that holds beyond expiry.
Should I switch my VXX calls to VIX calls? Not sure which one is better honestly
Ban
Yep. Most people started selling 2 weeks ago. No body who is looking to sell, waits till day before. This is only tanking more if the election doesn't have a clear winner.

you can scale money as high as you want to go with SPY.  SPX can do hundreds of thousands in dollars easily.  My goal is to do one trade every 2 weeks.

Hoping for a +2% SPY close today. After second half of October, new month, Biden lead, a bit of hope for the future, a bit of a DCB could happen, maybe.

I made 500% Friday with debit spreads. So yes. Harder to get fills so need to either expire ITM or sell for like 2-5% under the midpoint of bid and ask. But trades going against you fall much slower so I feel it‚Äôs easier to manage risk also. Do your research and best of luck!
The cynicism I‚Äôve cultivated over the past 8 months is now the cornerstone of my personality. So good luck, bots, you can celebrate without me.

What the fuck is this man, go to r/stocks or something. The "investors" there will be able to help you. We are r/wall street bets, and we are "traders" all we know is "stonks go up" and "buy high sell Low" now gtfo and get some help man

Didn't you say that today would be bloody (Referring to your last post) if no vaccine news this weekend?
Market is up a lot. Looks like another red day for RKT

Later. Futures are up
There really is no more unless it‚Äôs bad. Going to be next year.
Look it up you retard as of july 2020 they were at 10429 on the year. Do you guys know that you cant go from making 50k cars to 500k cars in a year? You realize you dont make cars solely in excel spreadsheets and Microsoft powerpoints?

This market will either crash and we can in a few years go back to blowing bubbles or stagnate over the next 10+ years. Buying in this market is nothing but a game of hot potato where you're banking on there being a dumber motherfucker than you willing to buy your "share" of a company that doesnt make a profit at a higher price.

To be fair it‚Äôs BAC and not JPM

Of course lol. It's been going up for few hours of course there's going to be some downwards trend for a while. All I know is it's going to be green for few hours, it might dip for a while but it'll go/stay up.

Kinda 50/50. This is how it looked last week when the market gapped up. So did NIO from 28-30, then ran to 32. Kinda feeling like we open around 34-35 and run to 37-38. But also moron Stanley said 33 so anything passed that could be seen as ‚Äòtake profit‚Äô. The move might be to sell calls ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Nio calls at open or is it to late?
If only trades can be made with hindsight
it‚Äôs retarded that you‚Äôre in the comics taking credit for a low effort meme you stole
Conservative calls placed Friday at close based on this == a 20% return at open today.

But keep making fun of things you don‚Äôt understand, enjoy being poor...
i mean if i were you, i would
no you
bruhh i anticipated good deliveries but i wasn‚Äôt sure how market would react so i just got long dated for their run up to earnings. i would definitely recommend taking profits and rolling some over to long dated or something maybe after election if ur comfortable but definitely it looks like it‚Äôs gonna be good for next couple months
Way too many people want the market to trade on fundamentals is all.  Unlike you: IQ < 70 and STOCK ONLY UP.

Buying calls at open. Nflx or ZM or TSLA or NVDA. Can't decide.
remember remember the first of september
end game? we still have 5 months til a profitable q4 ER. step up your game
how believably shallow of you
Dude, I been asking myself the same question for a month now and I wanna kill myself. Really thinking about buying the morning dip, but that super-FOMO is what kept me from buying all month ... Hell of a head scratcher.

Are there any bears in here who aren't nervous?  I've seen this story before when I was a bull crazy pump at open only to fade all day
idk tesla is just, weird in general, it's just gonna do whatever it wants
I meant the other one
I use debit spreads to lower my barrier to entry. Very rarely do I reach max profit. I usually sell at 20-30% profit. Which I would do on a single leg as well. 

Tldr debit spreads should be used to enter a position for a lower cost and doesn't really increase your chances of gains
haha what a wet dream, h ave fun being BONE dry nightmare
You know MM's are just flushing out the bulls with these two pumps.

why doesn't it want to break back down through 330? cmon MM's. sell your sheeet
Bears are fucked not only today, but for the rest of the week when civil war fails to develop and the market rallies in response.
You‚Äôd have to have a pretty large account for your broker to allow you to sell your long leg and keep your short leg naked. Not saying OP doesn‚Äôt have $32,000 for each short put just waiting for this opportunity, but that‚Äôs what it would take.
Shhhshhhshhhshhh... just close you eyes man

Np homie bro
i think what lockdowns did fuck the market were in china when shit was breaking the supply chain, ppl being locked down and dying in the US or Europe don't disrupt big international corporations as much, some of it was priced in since cases grew weeks ago in Europe and never stopped group in the US
I didn't claim to be smart nor I need any validation from anyone. I don't think writing some random code (be it python or c or c++) as any sign of intelligence, it's just matter of putting in effort and anyone can write code be it interrupt routine or anything else.
Back in march and april there were socially distanced lines around the local gun stores.
Way too many people actually hoping for a market crash. Fuck you guys

K shape recovery, Nio is the upper part, the rest is the lower
Cause that‚Äôs when the shit storm starts
It usually dips at open before the daily moon
Pump itttt
Im buying more shares but Im thinking it will pump wens if Biden wins and Ill sell sole CC cause i thinknwe still heading down until a stimulus is pssed
328-329 at open then bounce to 330 right before we SKY FALLLL and then we SKYYY FALLLLL

As usual, everything that happens before 9am is completely irrelevant
Anyone with a fucking brain and google know that it‚Äôs going to go down before, during and after the election. Then it‚Äôll skyrocket. Why fight the obvious? We have fucking years of data and people act as if being a bear or Bull matters. Just pick the right time fucking retards ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

what are your positions?
I was about to say that
"+1.18%" just a premarket pump
I have been trying so hard to supress my desire for nio puts as well.
It was decided until January.
Hey its Q2 2020 on the phone, they want to have their info back
Are we really gonna have a reverse of what happened on Thursday pre market? üòÇ
I speaking on a personal level.  This sub is straight up casino style.
I guess covid lockdowns don‚Äôt matter and the election actually isn‚Äôt happening judging by these futures
The election was so close, especially in Florida, that recounts were completed.  There was so much controversy over the ballots and how they were being counted that it ended up in the Supreme Court, where the justices essentially decided that bush won.
Fisker is the next NIO
i wouldnt say it cant mean ANY shit but it's definitely not a solid breakthrough at all.
Bears go guh today
‚úäüèøüêª
No scam bro.  They sell cars, nice cars and increasingly more and more of them.  Growth businesses lose money in their early years (Tesla lost money for a decade before becoming profitable).
wow sub 330 dip getting bought up
Don't steal the account, make him cash it out and give it back to him so he has to pay the taxes.

It‚Äôs a shitpost.. lighten up ü§£
I would be careful here. If Mango looses I can see him pulling all support on the printing press just out of spite.

He has said it on multiple occasions that if Biden wins it will crater the stock market. On one hand I think he wants it high if he leaves office, but he is so petty that I believe he will take it down.

If printing press stops going brrrr what happens. I don't think it will be good, but who knows
All my positions are green. PFE, GLW, GRWG, NIO
You sure lol
Wow I‚Äôm actually almost impressed, I meant the shitty wrestling association though.
I‚Äôm going to admit that I got overly excited in my üåàüêª phase last week but i‚Äôm holding because that what a üåàüêª does
Well, he did say he was gonna build a wall...
Wait!
No. Nio is a long term play for me.
BIG QUESTION! HOW HIGH IS NIO GOING?
That was the plan. I got dec puts, plan on selling Monday, but wtf it went up to 310 from 304 on Friday.
[deleted]
Ameripoors selling green again
You should be buying spy puts in case we don‚Äôt know who wins for months
Put holders would get all the tendies in that situation
TSLA will remain a premier brand, aspirational. NIO will be the Audi to TSLA‚Äôs BMW - but how the turn tables in that metaphor means things could get ramped up for NIO fast.

Not make, making.

7 on Snapchat puts from a week ago. & she just barely started. That lil whore‚Äôs about to get nasty.

Anyone here make decent gains with debit spreads?

Holy fucking shit. We up cause we been down hard. Its not fucking rocket science.
Even NIO came down a couple weeks ago. I would wait.
I‚Äôm very long into Sony for that exact reason.. but I just think nio is too volatile to keep up a gain overnight like that if it stays for the day
Wait for a dip. Its still going on its rocket ride
BULLISH.

Also like Captain America said, BUY SHARES! It'll help trigger the squeeze üòâ and for God's sake stop playing weeklies, we don't need any more people tapping out of the fight.

Dumb question..... YOLO it.  Then you can buy a new house and car for cash with your tendies.
Cheap date.
Apparently it's TNA.
Wait for a dip bro but absolutely
I have 1/15 35c leaps for NIO when should I sell? I want to get further leaps but don‚Äôt want to miss an ENPH type run.
RED BY OPEN AGAIN?!
Check my post history for the other NIO post. We so rich
Spoiler alert :: Bear R Fukt
Do it, I sell you one
Can only trade options 9:30-4pm no matter the broker, except SPY which stops at 4:15pm.
Was always going to happen
so nio is about to be a big compeitor in china it seems...tesla could get fucked
I hate people who call coffee "joe"
What a pussy. 

Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll be cash at open too most likely. Fuck this.
Then why TF are people hyping 3rd Nov?
Hold all day

Think my Baba puts will print?
I need to speak to the manager of SPY
premarket trading can't mean shit with that though right? low volume would fuck up any indicators
Bruh 80% here. We gonna be rich
Futures fading 

If this drops to .50% by open, it‚Äôs gonna be bloody
SPX being +40 pts but -20 off the highs = how low GEX manifests itself

My AMD can't even dare to go above 76 while QQQ is barely green unlike the Friday bonanza bears had
To all the retards out there... NIO will be back to 28 sooner than you think, it's volatile you autists. üß†ü¶µü§°
Actually broke through but with the election technical indicators are bonkers anyway. [https://prnt.sc/vbu3lk](https://prnt.sc/vbu3lk)
Pay rent and car note or yolo it
Agreed, if you're dealing with sizable capital offshore makes most sense (given you're able to comply with CFC rules) - though it'd set you back \~$10k per annum with one of the bigger law firms (necessary if you're planing on being able to defend an offshore structure). With ring-fencing via e.g. ICCs or PCCs this also allows for much better risk management compared to simple multi-entity holdings. Then again, this is all a joke to ya'll anyways, so just go ahead with your personal Tendies account.
This PM gap up is part of the big money plan. They are going to force the weaks out of their short positions, maybe even cause them to buy back in lol, and then dump this pile of sheeet on them at some point before the election. Volatility is huge obviously. Don't be that person to get screwed 2x.
Unfortunately this pump isn‚Äôt enough for your spy 350c FDs
If it dips, maybe.. if not.. depends how risky you feel
Not necessarily. Repubs love rock walls too :)
It won't end for weeks
What?
just wanted to drop in to share that I disagree with all your preexisting beliefs and biases
Nice!
Imagine not being an american
Last time it did this it went up 18% in a day
Cash, bitch
Futures are moving
Thinking about puts on nio, I‚Äôm very bullish on them but everytime after a massive day they tank
Shut up retard
Preach man. I was actually expecting a sell off at open and then getting in lol.
slowly declining... maybe the bears will live once more
Stand back
Stand ready
I am bullish and holding calls and I am thinking about buying puts once it peaks today. If there is a relief rally I don't think it'll last since it's election week
Im so butthurt about futures :(
I won't join.
I hope you have NIO puts, you deserve to lose all your money
This is one fake ass pump. We going red before open
Might continue to moon the whole week
Why would you teach her to do that? Now you both be broke, and in a year probably shooting heroine together in the gutter
You leave it alone!
As soon as murica wakes up the markets are fading. Why the US boys love it to dump so much ?
When are elections results published? After market close or before?
We're making rock walls a political thing now too? üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
PM is telling an interesting story, lots of volume, regardless if you're a gay bear like me or a bull, i hope we all know that today will be interesting af and that we're all gonna lose anyway
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yeah. 

Usually dips a bit by open but then moons the rest of the day
Good idea but CC companies can file to have their debt classified as non dischargeable if they can show that you use dischargeable debt to pay off non dischargeable debt.
wait for a pullback to get into FSR or get in now cuz it‚Äôs not coming down?
Careful with the FOMO, wait for a dip
Shut the fuck up
God I hope so
Bears, hold the line!
I call in my trades.
I'd wait until Wednesday
[removed]
Because buyers are back
Bull gang wins again
With that logic we should be mass buying TSLA puts
Yea, but maybe if trump wins the market will go crazy bullish.

NIO got more upside after open?
Good thing market is closed on Election Day, would be  too volatile
At least you're honest

Bought fucking Facebook 15 shares @ 282.50, right before earnings, got cucked. Bagholding it now

Predefined risk you nut.
Hold for 3 months
Yea
Take profit
Should I fomo into NIO calls at open if I don‚Äôt have any day trades left
After voting, I believe that lock  towns and cities for COVID.

Don‚Äôt use logic for the this market lol, I‚Äôm basing my trading off delusion and it‚Äôs working so far

Thank you very much! May the tendies be with you my friend
~~bagel~~ dick
Flat by open. Flat AF all day waiting for news.
Sell and just rotate into a higher strike
Wheel it
Pump is done. Question is is how low does it go today
I have the same position. I am selling at open, waiting for a dip, and rebuying
For today, yes IMO. I look for moves near the resistance/support lines.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs not always that simple but hey even a retard like you can be right sometimesüëç
Yeah it sucks because I'm a long term Tesla holder and would love a place to discuss actual news and strategy but it's impossible over there. 

The amount of people who think if they buy today but if it's worth the same +1$ in a decade it's a good investment is crazy.

Even worse they encourage each other. Atleast wsb is blatant about being dumb and not actually investment advice.
Depends on how the market opens. If there's a surge of buying, then obviously you want to sell your long put. I don't know that the buying will continue though so I might be tempted to hold everything in your position and buy back the short put once I think the highs are in and the buying looks exhausted.
Sell NIO before open ?
Big sell today.
lol thanks
Why are u over reacting ,? Even if futures were up by 69%, shits going to crash hard by Wednesday the latest man ..
Should I take my Nio profits and exit or hold on?
Positions? or GTFO

You can do both at the same time. Just long press one of the options if your using your phone.
Wtf else fun is there to do than yolo margin during lockdown

Yes, you can help people like me very easily.  Back-test your theories. Show your results.
It‚Äôs a reward system
I have a gambling problem
Can confirm, they still have PayPal. Checked my eBay
Yes - the IPO price was overvaluing the company
Turned 200 to 1200$ on Friday, now need to turn it into 5000$, any trades ?

Congrats and fuck you!!! :)
Okay, since clearly this is a retarded pump PM that has no chance of holding, what‚Äôs the best puts to buy to capitalize on this retardation?
Not if you need something to exchange for goods and services other than goods and services. Gold cant be printed and inflation cannot devalue it. It is a very densely valuable finite resource. Great for money.

Not a bad plan. There's going to be wild swings this week, don't let big money dictate what you should do on a micro level. Of course they could force short squeezes if the money keeps flooding in.

Yeah, but that always happens in an election year when the democrat is poised to win. Records get broken every time. "Surely they are going to come for my guns this time!" mentality.
Wtf is there to cry about. Lift some fuckin weights. And be ready to buy more in 2 hours.

Rotated my entire portfolio to 75% NIO and 25% BABA Friday.
For Trump's case, I think it may pick speed back up later on in the year, or even next year. Depending on how potential protests and these parties react to each other.
Pretty sure you can demonstrate that a vehicle is necessary for income so they leave it alone.  If you have 2+ though...

Don‚Äôt sell those puts at open, market will drop before it rises.
I want to just yolo them or at least half my portfolio in calls and half shares but I don't even know which options I want at this point cause I missed the wave.
Remember dumb fucks that are blabbing R this D that.  Positions or ban.

The rule is: when you see a big green (or red) dildo - you're too late. Stop. Don't chase it. That is how you buy high, sell low. A better bet is to inverse. It will very much likely have some pullback. And almost never it will just continue. You are literally about to buy at ATH in overall high IV and downtrend.

What I will play - veeery wide iron condor on BABA earnings if the IV is high.

I mean if you were here Friday morning people were saying -1% was mooning
Im sure plenty of theta gang got fuk last week with that 2-3 sigma move.
Sir this is a casino. Fuck TA.
Drilling the drill team?  Talk about bearish.
You'll need at least a 1% change from open in order to be profitable.

The average SPY low-open or high-open change is around 0.5%.

Short this guy's ETF.
that's how to read out the market, couldn't agree more
Far OTM calls on the US Constitution and a decisive electoral victory
Thought that was priced in on Thursday
Research = flip a coin
Only on wallstretbets is +1% dumping
Because market does weird shit around an election, and also because it was a big ol dump Friday. Market will spike in the AM as the dumb algos buy what they see as a dip, then massive selloff either midday or near close today.

Or inverse me idk, I'm just as retarded as the rest of you chucklefucks.
How many of you are fucked rn

I‚Äôm buying calls, last time to buy the dip
RKT has an 18% short interest, while being the only mortgage company with the FINTECH to scale to meet this unprecedented REFI demand that will last going into 2022. All while continuing to make key acquisitions including Rocket Auto which further diversifies their family of Companies
Anyone here made big money with stocks using margin on webull.
I invested 170k in spce shares out of which 110k is my cash and remaining is on margin
If you know what it is, why stay away? Hella money to be made out here.

Kinda like meeting up with a craigslist hooker at a hotel....you know you're leaving broke and robbed, with aids, or in handcuffs.   Sometimes all three.  But you still do it anyway.
Nice try bears. Americhads about to buy the fuck out of all the dips. SPY green 3% by close

That because people were still getting in even after I commented that the breakout was taking to long and to get out. Basically people were looking at the title and not the notes.

Jesus Christ good thing I dumped my DNKN puts
I said the sentiment is not significantly negative, I did not say we won¬¥t see a correction from the downtrend before the US Session. 

The Euwax has been at +20, not it¬¥s at -20. 

Just because the market has been pushing up the last 2 hours doesn¬¥t mean I¬¥m wrong, and even if we see a significant rally today that still dosen¬¥t mean the sentiment is wrong. It just means it wasn¬¥t a good contraindicator today due to different reasons.

With credit spreads OTM they naturally get to keep what ever time value that decay per day. Making it cheaper to buy back. With IV decline after elections results are known a significant amount of IV should be removed, allowing a much cheaper buyback henceforth making profit with all other conditions being the same.

This is the Tesla sub every gd morning. 

If its not up 5% a day "fud!!!! Market manipulation is real! God they always hold us back with their tricks!!!"

If it goes up 5% "not bad still cheap compared to what it'll be in a decade. Theres still no competition. Apple sold 10m iphones so if Tesla sells 10 cars and each car has a 10m robotaxi value (+-1B) by comparison we should be worth 10x apple.....20T cap incoming."
I don't think so
Trump will declare victory before counting the mail-ins.
I like how bear trying to make sense of this green dildo by convincing themselves that it will dump eodüòÇbut they don‚Äôt know that after election it will even go parabolic

Since you bring up the question probably, but seeing how there‚Äôs 2 hours till the market opens and after a weekend of holding, probably not.
I created it since I needed it. So no am not wasting my time :)  
just shared it for others who might be in the similar boat.

I‚Äôm literally hoping SPY goes ridiculously high PM so I can dollar average these puts very cheaply for the week.
It was a decades long debate until genetic testing became as accurate as it is you shit for brains moron. And check out duck duck go or something, you fucking mouth breather.
I can‚Äôt wait to see the losses from the NIO bears
Fomo into NIO at open? Last time it did such bigly moves when it was 23 AH and 26 EOD...
Keep pumping you fuck pj pussies this should be +3%
Every tech stock I have calls in barely green now. Bruh fuck this. Iv crush too. I literally can never win even on a +1 Green Day holding calls  or -2% red holding puts.
What can I say? I like losing money üòÇ
Biden and a republican senate would mean no tax hike, no infrastructure bill and also a skinnier version of the skinny bill. Either way puts on CAT are free money imo.

The source code is right there, if you are not comfortable reading it - you can ask someone you trust to read the code and let you know. This code only talks to Robinhood server and exports data locally. This doesnt upload your token nor data anywhere else.
Imagine buying puts while the stock is lowly rising, then you switch to calls, then the stock slowly decreases... you bleeding from both sides.

just went over the case law and britain does have stronger legal protections for corporate separation

i think it could still fall under the wrongful trading exception, where it is obvious you are solely creating a separate entity to take riskier positions with creditor funds. that said, im not going to pretend im an internet lawyer and argue about it either way.

honestly, it would never come to that anyway. any direct loan to the company would need to be backed by personal assets and any margin agreement from the broker would need to be similarly backed

short and simple answer is that youre unlikely to gain much benefit from incorporating your trading in any western jurisdiction outside of taxation advantages. for example, it could make sense to offshore your trading so that you can compound returns without paying taxes. however, you would need to avoid paying out to yourself as income for this effect to really show an impact

Anything can happen, indeed, yet the biggest takeaway to investors post-Covid has been been that, though the market dropped substantially around February/March, it gained everything and more thereafter (minus a few various sectors more susceptible to things). People seeing the drops now, or, say, last week, are not afraid: it is perceived as a buying opportunity.

Again, bring on the downvotes.
Take out atleast the initial investment, I will personally fly over there, beat the living crap out of you, kick you in the left nut and then pay for your sisters bills if you loose the money.
Double dick
If there is a clear result probably.
Upvotes downvotes they all make me feel so GOOD!
I held my SPY 215 put after it hit 222 cause I thought it would dump after a new low. Never did I imagine it would open over 230 on Monday. fuck this shit
Why is volume so high
Bears are like those dudes who pay chicks in black leather to step on their balls with high heels. They enjoy the pain... they get off on it even. So in that regard I‚Äôm happy for them this morning.

Yeah lol
You are very ENTJ
Anyone have a heat map - what sectors are carrying the day?
It's not that expected. See how many bull retards are still smoking hopium here.

People think Jpow will save them, but Jpow can't really do shit. When people realize that Jpow has no power in a massive sell-off they'll sell even harder.

I mean really most of what Jpow is doing is simply drilling yields into the abyss. All of that means is that bonds can no longer be used as hedge, so the only thing left for virgin Wall Street funds is to stop-loss sell. The fed blew the bubble but they can't defeat gravity.

He's not even doing a good job with inflation. All you retards got psyopsed by the Fed into thinking that money printer go brrr is an actual thing. Inflation expectations drive inflation harder than fucking QE with no commercial banks lending, y'all got played.

Then why are guns used symbolically by groups who believe in white superiority are said to be exercising their right but if a group of blacks did the same they would be slaughtered in the streets by police? 

Allowing access to firearms does not provide the disadvantaged with a chance to succeed if none of the other machinations of society align with that ideal. Firearm ownership thus becomes another form of oppression insidiously hiding behind the idea that everyone has an equal right to self defense.

Papa Elon is smart. He will IPO the Starlink at the market bottom
Economics plays no part in today's markets...
So vix is just a measure calculated based on the current market dynamics. So you have to choose your tool to bet on the vix. 

Like VXX is rolling 1-2 month futures contracts I think
And UVXY is 1.5x that same thing

Those two are ones I sometimes use but there‚Äôs all sorts of options. There once even was a 3x etf but I think that‚Äôs gone. Do some googling and find one you like. 

Puts on uvxy if it spikes today or tomorrow is def a good move imo. Right now it‚Äôs too low and IV is too high so the move is played out. 

I think there might be inverse vix etfs too that could be good

Bit early for all that. We are decentralizing and distributing tech and accept wfh is viable. Those two things could enable further booms but across the whole country. Who the hell thought we were going to see engineers flooding Boise??

By making using of stocks and options you can obtain a portfolio that is protected by large down moves or up moves. I suggest checking out tastytrade for their theory.

Most for a month. Only things closed down are restaurants (only eat in), bars, coffee shops (only eat in), and entertainment avenues. So near for a week then full on bull season.
Except for bears 

You can watch them in denial in replies
this is a sub for retards, wat do u expect?

Yep retards will sell them we moon harder

Profit or mastery comes at a cost of the 10,000 hours. So assuming you complete the 10,000 hours regardless of wins or losses. I think you can come out ahead in the long term but the path to 10000 can vary in expenses for many and some might quit

damn expected green monday but not crackhead green pump. dollar and oil saying fake to this rally, let‚Äôs see if it holds.
isn't comparing the shape of graphs a total waste of time?  you can zoom in our out on any stock chart and find matching shapes that are essentially meaningless
Theory might work, assuming your money was at play for 10,000 hours. In the market versus watching the market.

Sold my puts Friday because I made 80% profit on them and didn‚Äôt want to take a chance with the possibility of Monday being green.
At the upper-left corner of the '0' write a '1'. Use a diagonal cross from upper-left to lower-right to cross out BOTH the '1' and the '0'. Write a '9' on top of the crossed-out '10'. Then and only THEN can you repeat the process on the next digit to the right. It's the most important part of printing more money. Many countries around the world print more money without first lowering interest rates closer to zero. Perhaps they don't have a No. 2 pencil with an eraser on the top. JPOW wields a No. 2 pencil in ways that ensure infinite money printing.

The power of a double top shouldn't be underestimated. The triple top is just a rule of the universe.

Some things about TA make sense, many others only make sense because TA is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I like to think of it as "TA tells you more or less how the price will go, but it doesn't tell you where."

Imagine thinking that you could explain March with TA.

Trying to figure out how severe were the cases before going to the ventilator. If u didnt know ventilators are tubes down ur wind pipe and the body fights it.   ,,Being on a ventilator may make you more susceptible to pneumonia, damage to your vocal cords, or other problems.‚Äô‚Äô

Got it from here

I hardly believe it was covid that gave your guys severe breathing problems.  Also I heard doctors are payed to put people on ventilators, like thousands of dollars

This is dumb af. 40b market cap they have sold like 25k cars in their existance.

Tesla like a 380b company and will have 500k this year.

Nio is more retardo bubble than Tesla.

Look at the numbers other than fucking share price you fucking morons.
All of this rhetoric against China from our president is only driving the Chinese to become even more nationalistic. Unlike the American consumer, the Chinese have no problem with voting with their pocketbooks. Why Nio is doing well.

Isn't she wallstreet candidate? I feel like we will be fine.
I need to have a word with you about my method of looking at the market as it shows the opposite of what you say..

MY TA is option prices themselves.. and there is more premium short term on the upside, but then later I see more premium on the down side..

I'll explain later, but that may. actually possibly be the real reason we are up now, as this is a short term pump before a dump..

Hey buddy. Sold all my SPY puts at near max gains Fri and switched to calls very close to all lows around 2:50pm.

I think SQ, FDX is going to print hard. Others will also but I am not sure I‚Äôll hold anything. May see how today goes take gains, and move back into weekly SPY puts ATM.

It's definitely good odds that there is contested state..but if either candidate has a win by more than what the "contested" state is worth in votes then what's the point of contesting market will react with confidence that X candidate is the next president.

while i understand the price point is appealing, i just cant see i being a sustainable company unless it truly becomes a big name brand as a whole. no asian would be caught dead with a knock off versace, gucci, etc. i feel like as a culture they use what they have until it doesnt work. so they would rather have a 5 year old versache than be caught dead with a kate spade. i feel like the same would apply for a tesla, youre buying a brand not a car. same with peloton, exercise bikes and programs have been around forever they just created a community and a brand that FEELS different and elite

Checked and can't find it, we have shit merch. Someone needs to take over the store and get is better options.
Have to get some up to stay range bound
I totally agree and think that we‚Äôll bounce around for the next two days between 331 and 323 and then Wednesday will be the day that gives us what direction we‚Äôre headed
If the election is somehow uncontested and there is a clear winner Wednesday then we‚Äôre mooning but a too close to call/contested election will be a catalyst to bring us down to the 315-310 level
> We are NOT locking down again.

Said every country in Europe as well. The longer you wait, the worse it gets. See france for example
there's actually a chance we limit up here if it keeps pumping like this

Why are you still bagholding? Holding a security is the same as buying it . To put it another way: knowing what you know now, if you hadn‚Äôt already invested in Nokia would you do so today? If not then get out of the sinking ship.
TA is a complete joke.  No TA guys can point to any chart strategy and back-test it over many years to show profitability.  It's all anecdotal.
ok this pumping too fast especially before elections wtf
Dumped 1/3 of my portolio into SPXL at 51.16, went very red but premarket right now is 50.06. Should I just take the loss and sell at open or baghold?
I'd say yes but if Biden is elected and the rona cases continues to grow exponentially I think US will go to lock down.

No one is shutting down because of election but there has to be something afterward. So short term (like 1-2 mo) I‚Äôm buying no short term dates plays

Jesus Christ, what was that pump? Lol
I wish I could remember who said it or even the exact quote, but this was in the 90's.  Someone asked one of the big bankers why they immediately offered high interest credit cards to people who just filed bankruptcy, and he said, "Because they have a taste for it" or something to that effect.  He knew they couldn't file again right away, and that they were bad at managing finances and thus likely to just keep paying premiums forever.

The problem is that bear markets are way much more rare and unlikely. This changed a bit due to corona , but look at that, post crash 1 the market rose as fast as it never did before.

Being perma bull is a good mindset investing into shares over the course of years. AKA literally buying the dip.

YOLOING has nothing to do with this obviously, but its rather more likely the next day that the stock increases and not decreases.

I could be wrong but, imo, market barely moved when trump was hospitalized. First round of China tariffs had bigger impact because unexpected.

Did you mean approaching overbought
This was me, but then I thought, fuck it, I would be so mad if they would rise again instead of giving me the dip, so i thought rather go -100 at first and not be mad, than that the stock rises and I didnt buy.
The market will do exactly opposite to what u saying maybe??? 

What u recommend - to sit in cash today?
don't listen to these retards, sell and wait to see. Cutting loss is the most important thing. Opportunities are everywhere in today's market.
I think its because they reset it every day at midnight, so it correlates to the moves from then on

Bruh I opened every single website I could think of and only saw bad news.
This aged well
R voters are huge retards who allow themselves to be convinced by the GOP that the Democrats are coming to take their guns away at any moment, despite the fact that this has literally never happened. They panic buy all of the guns and bullets and then whine that it's a government conspiracy that there are no bullets. They're too smoothbrained to draw any kind of connection between the 4,000 rounds of 9mm they just bought and the fact that there's no 9mm at the store.
Nice color and drawings, look very professional. Even though 1987 is completely unrelated to this situation.
I lost 90% on calls overnight lmao. Thought rocket was gonna kill earnings (they did I‚Äôm pretty sure) but it absolutely tanked. Got caught being greedy. I‚Äôm looking to get back into them after this election mess as a long term play.

Everyone assumed that they were going to drop the market today in anticipation of tmrw. So of course the MMs did it on Friday. Look at the massive hedge fund buying action over the past week, they're getting ready for a rug push

Good luck to you too. It‚Äôs honestly a gamble this week going either way.
Pro tip for anyone playing options this week, üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª or bulls, play debit spreads instead of plain options. IV is going to be retarded so unless we get retarded moves you will lose retard money. Play spreads so you can also benefit from this retard IV, retard. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Stop reminding that

Yeah, sorry. It was my disappointment which came out as a rude comment. 

I am net bullish this month and you were providing some good comments. I was just reading them for a different perspective and found an amount in the screenshot which is less than a hedge for someone who's been permabull this whole year.

Apologies my disappointment came out as somewhat of a rude comment. But best of luck. Hope both of us make money

I plan on making large financial decisions today at the close based solely on doing the opposite of what the howler monkeys are screeching in here.
And dont get me wrong Id Like to See them lower as Well tho, the Chart is Just Not looking Like it. The Most Money in Stocks rn is from the Fed and Banks and they wont Take it Out.
I guess it gives a sense of security but it doesn't make sense to invest now

L3 Harris (LHX). This is an amazing company, the 6th largest company in Aerospace/Defense, that is a better engineering innovator than Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, Boeing or Raytheon. Unlike those companies, its delivery of its engineering projects is generally on time, on budget and successful. Consistently makes money and beats earnings. As a growth stock in the sector, it even had good dividends (but not as good as Lockheed's) It was gaining on the top 3 companies in January just before coronavirus. 

It was a sure thing, when coronavirus hit. [Even up to Sept 30, it was on Goldman Sachs' conviction buy list.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3162976&headline=LHX-LHarris-downgraded-to-Buy-from-Conviction-Buy-at-Goldman-Sachs) But nothing. People are refusing to buy it. So eventually, by around mid-October, it's become unofficially a Sell, for no reason except no one would buy it. I say "unofficially" because it's not going to be rated a sell with its great fundamentals, by any rational analyst. But people have been dumping it because it's going nowhere when other companies in its sector have become aerospace and defense memes. It's now sagging back to about March lows, even tho it's a better aerospace/defense company on fundamentals than Lockheed, Boeing, and Raytheon. I'm watching aerospace companies that have jack shit for potential in the near and long term get lots of speculative money, while L3 Harris just dies on the board every day.

As far as I can tell, it's all because of retail investor rejection and momentum trading following retail investor pop stocks. It's hard for an industry outsider to figure out what the company does (which includes designing and managing the country's entire air traffic control and navigation system and a lot of other civil aviation). Actually, this stock is what led me to recognize the damaging impact of retail investor bubbles on US industrial companies. Right now, capital investment is at the mercy of retail investors, mostly kids, who have no idea about the stocks they're buying and selling. It's turned the market into something like Instagram, where meme stocks are recognized and traded based on their meme capital and not on anything else, really, like value, importance, earnings and market fundamentals. L3 Harris is full of uncommunicative dorks, apparently, and it's hard to figure out what the company does from its shitty, cheap website (whereas the other top defense contractors have cool, dynamic websites designed to pull people who have played video games and distract from the fact that they specialize 100% in killing machines). 

At one point (before I realized that the investing now is dominated by millennials and their meme stocks) I had $80K in LHX, waiting for it to, at minimum, recover the 30-40% of value it should have. I lost about 10% before I realized that right now, the stock market is like social media, where kids have to like something for it to exist. 

Finally, I broke and in tears sold it all off. Now I'm waiting for the US meat economy to go onto its last legs and die, plunging us into a deep economic depression, as real companies starve of capital, shrivel up and die while most of the country's capital investment pours into NVDA, NFLX, AAPL, FB, TSLA and other memes recognizable by children. I cut all my other US industrial and infrastructure investments at the same time, and have watched them continue to go downhill while people frantically plow money into the bubble stocks trying to prop them up for no actual reason that makes any sense, since they can sell them and invest in companies that still have significant upside left in their recovery, instead of sitting in a bubble. So I'm sitting here, watching retail investors destroy America's capital investment flows to real meat world industries during an economic crisis. Why? To throw too much, and unneeded, capital investment at colorful pop culture companies that are easy to recognize without a lot of effort. Companies that make grownup toys, gadgets, games, movies and cool cars. And the major layoffs from the real meat world companies that don't have capital to go on much longer are about to begin, which will be the next leg down for our economy.

I'm going to go drink the last dregs of my coronavirus hoard of Everclear for breakfast now.

Schwabs email to customers this morning 


Last week, stocks had a rough ride, with the S&P 500¬Æ Index falling nearly into correction territory by Friday. Our latest commentary highlights several factors that likely contributed: continuing concerns about a stalling U.S. economic recovery, disappointing third-quarter earnings from some large tech companies, and the uncertainty associated with Tuesday's election, to name a few. 

Markets may not see much relief in the week ahead, with many investors apprehensive about the possibility of an unclear or disputed election result. However, we expect any election-related volatility to be brief, and we encourage you not to overreact or try to time the markets based on political considerations.
Dam dude you got plenty of time

300C june 2021?
Because only retards would think that the market will keep tanking after Nasdaq dropped 500 pts in one week.
History never repeats it self. Only way marlet can crash is if investment banks start to sell their shares of big companies. Which would create a panic an the already inflated bubble will burst. But because the interest rates are so low I do not see that happening anytime soon, because they are worse off as well. People lose their savings, declaring bankruptcy n shit...

Tesla 397 C will be ITM by morning. I will close them only if stock gain will cover the premium cost and difference in  mark price and strike price. Or I will wait for theta decay till expiration this Friday.
Its been working ALL YEAR.
Don‚Äôt regret too early. Traps everywhere
‚ÄúToo early to bury RKT just yet‚Äù

Ya think? It‚Äôs been publicly traded for about 1 quarter now, released one earnings report where they absolutely murdered, and are currently trading ~5% above IPO price. 

What about that would make anyone think RKT is dead?  Don‚Äôt be so stupid next time. Now go yolo all the money you have on next June $25 calls.  Thank me in April when you close the position.
Oh shit, really? Got a link for this?

The money that needs to be taken out before election has already been taken out aka the drop. Big money just waiting to see where to put it. Election not gonna drag us down anymore.

I have $3000 thank you very much.
We will go parabolic just like the covid deaths #bullish
So I spent 2 grand in ATM NIO calls, panicked and hedged with 1 grand of spy puts

Why do I do this
And another CNBC dude said 280 or even 250 before the year‚Äôs end
You mean Wednesday
Imagine how many bears nestled themselves all snug in their beds last night while tendie-plums danced in their heads and will be waking up in the coming hours questioning the existence of god.
Yeah how did earnings go for every other company this past week? You think that will magically change in election week? PTON puts printed last week. $10-$16 more down to go then maybe calls will print
we'd be red rn if so. stimy gonna pop off in t-2 days.

Do it OP
Buy on the way down and wait for the rebound, the more you buy at a low cost the lower your average and higher your gains!

RIP. I remember buying into this in January of this year, watched it rocket to $41 for no reason (I sold when they were $28) and stopped paying attention since then. 

For me I feel like they'll do better when the economy recovers and people want to be extremely speculative again, other than that it seems like a dead stock.
Suck a dick dude, stop posting about it because anything that's posted here eventually goes to shit.
My account is 100% SPY puts and VIXY calls. I honestly want to open in the green so I can add a few k more onto them, but if it plays out like last week, we will be red by euro close.
Keep your fingers crossed ü§û have a feeling when people start waking up they‚Äôll pile on but Idrk plan on dumping my 11/2 330 at open and buying further dated 11/16 340ish but also scalping the uppy downies the next few days

Don‚Äôt act like Trump is anti private prisons and don‚Äôt act like we‚Äôll see tough on crime 90s policies ever again. You‚Äôre thinking with your dick
Yes
It‚Äôs not quite that simple. States need to tally all of the votes. A lot of states have a lot of mail-in ballots; which take a ton of more time to properly account for. So, if not enough states can report their votes (mail-in and in-person) by the end of the night tomorrow, it will roll into the next day. I‚Äôm not an expert on the matter, but, I anticipate it being announce or pretty much decided on Wednesday. But, really it‚Äôs gonna come down to how the swing states are handling their votes. I know some states starting counting mail-in votes early. But, a swing state like PA, I think is waiting to start tomorrow. No way they have them all counted tomorrow, and it‚Äôll likely be close.
Bears still talking about buying more puts üòÇü§£üò≠.    
You can‚Äôt write this stuff.

You clearly dont have any idea. You did not take into account of expense and health. Car insurance, gas, food, bills,... all of this can cripple your monthly wage. I worked at fedex for 15 bucks per hour and i earn 2k per month. If i save all year and not spend a single dime, i would have 24k in my bank right? Rich as fuck right? NO.
Less than 1% of people have over 100k in their 20s and 100k absolutely not from working as cashier or package handler. You are delusional and have no concept of money. 

Edit: folks under 25 have insane cost of auto-insurance and some are still having school which cannot divest 80% of their times to working. No 16-18 years old is able to work a full time job then go home and do their works to get ready for school then go work again after school then go home and have less than 6 hours of sleep. What planet you are living on which have over 24 hours per day?

doesnt let you set stop losses for certain stock exchanges above a certain amount of shares and don't tell you about it until you try to set the stoploss, which u have had to already bought the shares to do because they dont allow you to set a stop loss in ur first order to buy the shares. They also often don't allow you to withdraw and when they do it takes really long

Bears losing money all week.  You didn‚Äôt read the JPOW news apparently.
He doesn‚Äôt because if he did he would be BEYOND dumb there is zero evidence for that claim, he is making it to suppress the votes.  

If the dem voter turnout increases 100% that wouldn‚Äôt be suspect. Trump is extremely horrible and a significant portion of America sees it and wants him gone
I think you are oversimplifying. The biden page links to a PDF from gabby giffords organization, and I think really it would be a fee not a tax. Which is actually a pretty big difference. Particularly that the money you pay would go to administration of guns/gun safety/etc not into the govt general fund. Similar to hunting license fees.

Also saying it's propaganda is kind of redundant, it's literally a campaign website.

It's as if they didn't know volatility means both up and down..
Fuck plebbit shitsucker admins
Friendly reminder, if you get into NIO now then you will have gained 60% when it hits $50 next month.
Lol this is funny.

Societal breakdown secondary to a disaster is why people panic buy, to stop desperate people from taking their massive stockpiles of toilet paper and lysol.

Jesus fuck options are so expensive right now
The problem with attacking #1 mobile phone maker, China's Huawei, in the expectation that it will clear the field for European & American phone companies that can't compete with it, is that there's a reason why those phone companies were losing to Huawei. Apple was just good enough to take advantage of the opportunity, Nokia was not. So expectations > reality.

I tried to be polite you fucking dimwit, but Google is not allowed in China, so that's a no go.

It's a decades long debate, and they let any jackoff like yourself edit Wikipedia so I wouldn't take that as fact or an definitive answer.

There's a $200 tax stamp on NFA items and you officially get put on a government list if the feds give you permission to own one. Biden wants add a bunch of normal stuff like like standard capacity magazines and semi-auto rifles to the NFA list because the Supreme Court will never let them fully ban them. 

The 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA) is what makes all the fun stuff illegal unless you pay the $200 tax stamp (which was something like $3800 in 1934 adjusted for inflation) and go through an in-depth background check where the federal government crawls up your ass and then gets to know where your silencer or short barrel rifle or whatever is located and when you travel with it. It was basically passed to keep poor people from getting Tommy guns and Browning Automatic Rifles and revolting during the Great Depression. Now the Democrats want to add a bunch of semi automatic rifles and magazines to the list to continue to keep poor people under control. Watch in a few more years when they'll try to increase the price of that tax stamp.
Already on to it.

I beg to differ. At least the Zoo people at the Chongching Zoo in China, the largest population of non wild Panda's in the world have been spouting that they are in fact part of the raccoon family, they even have this nugget of info as a trivia question to zoo guests. Now they could have just been messing with the round-eyes, but I don't believe so. Looking at some of the non-giant variations like the smaller brown Panda: the resemblance to raccoon traits is much more pronounced. Where can these molecular studies that state different be found good sir?

Hi  [u/ContentViolation1488](https://www.reddit.com/user/ContentViolation1488/)

I do think this is the best way to mimic the buy and hold strategy and get premium on top.

I guess you're using it, how did it hold up the last month?
‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt make a deal, that means they don‚Äôt get the money,‚Äù Trump told host Maria Bartiromo. ‚ÄúThat means they can‚Äôt have universal mail-in voting; they just can‚Äôt have it.‚Äù And then he slowed down the mail in votes. And now he claims all votes after Election Day won‚Äôt count. A significant majority of mail in votes are democrat, he knows that too. 

Biden isn‚Äôt doing any of this type of election fraud
Good, means demand skyrockets and everyone is forced to by the newest generation of iPhone
Smart move
I don't usually commit margins to big stop loss limits. But when I do, I'm very sure they will fuck me over with the top 10 greatest ever pumps or cliff dives.

Neither did biden. He is against mail in ballots for no actual reason based on evidence. There is no evidence of people sending in fake ballots enough to chance anything significant at all. A handful out of tens of millions. 
It is blatantly cheating to throw out all votes after Election Day that were mailed before, SPECIFICALLY when he CAUSED THE DELAY! he ordered the mail to be slowed and he admitted himself it‚Äôs to slow votes. 
He is the one doing voter fraud, not random individuals.

I don't see Trump systematically telling people to steal ballots. 

Regardless, think about it logically. He was against mail in ballots. He didn't want them in the first place. If he thinks Democrats are sending out fake ballots(which many people believe but only a major jump in Democrat voter turn out will prove and many think the fact we are almost at 70% total turnout in 16` is evidence of this) then he would logically be fine with that. It's not illogical what he doing though you may think it's wrong. 

Either way, if you think the vote is incorrect for whatever reason, either side should fight it.
Sure did pal

This is the Kinda motivation I needed to hold puts through election
No, the panic buying really kicked off with the riots. It was still pretty easy to find guns and ammo when all the lockdowns started.

Nationwide riots + defunding police + election year when the Democrats are going to make buying a gun as annoying as possible if they win + virus hype + economic uncertainty = it's probably a great time to be a first time gun buyer

I cracked my lower back and my sinus headache went away.

So I'm a chiropractor now apparently
Last Friday, at 2:45pm when SPY hit 323 range I sold out of all my short positions, and moved into OTM monthly range calls, on tickers whose value was beaten way down, and had the potential in the past weeks to jump large % either way, but to flip them short term. Let‚Äôs see how that goes today... 

CHWY 18 Dec 70c   /   DKNG 19 Feb 21c   /   ETSY 18 Dec 24c  /   FDX 18 Dec 140c   /   SQ   20 Nov 165c
volatility is velocity of time
I don't think its random (though I never bothered to check how they decide it so it could be for all I know). You can think of it as it's original purpose, is to allow people to enjoy more time in the day, and less time in the dark.
We pumping because the bagholders like me know it's too late to sell, the time to get out was last week. It's all or nothing now, we ain't selling for a loss. May it enrage you.

Ah yes the classic pump into Europe open. Like a kid on a bike you gotta push em in the right direction.
It's a relic of older times. It's still used today because there isn't enough momentum to change it, and other assortment of reasons (e.g. retail stores like it because more relative daytime=more shopping). But to most of us it's basically 1. We lose or gain an hour of sleep and 2. Morning is really dark or early sunset.

 Beep Boop, I'm a bot. If I made an error or if you have any questions, my [creator](https://np.reddit.com/u/6b86b3ac03c167320d93) might check my messages.  
 [Source Code](https://github.com/laurinneff/no-google-amp-bot) | [Issues](https://github.com/laurinneff/no-google-amp-bot/issues) | [FAQ](https://laurinneff.ch/2020/10/17/nogoogleampbot/)  
Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.
They are just testing and trying to break upwards then keep getting rejected. But still not going down wtf
Also, https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/01/us/trump-biden-election.amp.html

Stealing ballots vs that. in response, trump says ‚ÄúIn my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong‚Äù on twitter, referencing the fbi investigating the bus incident people. 

Point is, you can point to a few individuals stealing ballots, but so can I. I‚Äôve heard many stories recently of maga doing it. Both individual extremists do. 
But trump is systemically doing it in a way biden isn‚Äôt which is why Hillary said what she did. If Biden was also doing stuff like that I say the standard should be the same. Hilary prob doesn‚Äôt though. But I do, and Biden hasn‚Äôt needed to have that applied since he isn‚Äôt doing that systemic cheating
I understood what you were referencing, but it's not a useful indicator because the current VIX futures contract expires well after the election

Guns and ammo are still being bought at ridiculously high prices and rates. 9mm is over double the price it was at the beginning of the year, and 22LR is hard as hell to get. Your assumption that gun consumers are already over the panic buying and bulk buying phases is ridiculous. We're still in the middle of it. No idea if it affects stocks though at this point. The stocks might be too high already to go any higher even with panic.
Lol...

I mean he didn't really write an application.

These are just simple GET request scripts from the Robinhood API using your own access token, which run on your own local machine, saving data locally to either JSON, etc.

There's no part in the code where data gets saved on a remote server of his. You could definitely do that and that would be malicious. I know this because obviously he shared the source code.

If this retard had wrote this in a compiled language (C++ for example), without providing the source code and  giving just the compiled program, then that would be a red flag because you don't know what the program is doing.

Even if he did give us a compiled program and the source code, I still wouldn't trust it. You should only trust something you can compile yourself by having access to the code.

Python is an interpreted language, which means there's a program (Python interpreter) which dynamically translates each line of code into machine code (0s and 1s) for your machine to execute, without needing to compile it yourself.

In his scripts, there's a python shell executable that allows you to choose which of these requests to execute.

The only way you can fuck this up is cloning the repository, opening a branch, hard coding in your token, and pushing it remotely.

But this is WSB, who knows how one might fuck this up.

It's more due to the ~~riots.~~ mostly peaceful protests. Civil unrest due to corona would only come from lockdowns that people get sick of and start rioting like we see in Europe.

Always inverse wsb.

Thats why i am a bull.
I work at a store that also sells guns. We‚Äôve nearly tripled our all time high this year (and we‚Äôre not even to Black Friday *shudders*). We‚Äôre seeing insane amounts of first-time gun buyers, because with everything that‚Äôs happened this year everybody is scared. 

Everyone but especially the elderly are scared of civil unrest

Minorities are scared of brown shirts

Republicans are scared of bans or confiscations

And on top of that an increase in natural disasters in the region have people really nervous about the future. And even that viral video of the mountain lion chasing the guy out of the canyon inspired a rash of people getting concealed carry permits and handguns.

success is preceded by failure, sure, but when there‚Äôs only failure and no time left for success, like the game is over and the only option is to start a new ‚Äúgame‚Äù or just give up, what keeps some people going? delusion? denial? stupidity? ignorance?
The call is hard to do because you need to time it correctly. You need to call when the stock is low, and put when it's high.

It's clearly an issue with you're timing, that's all.
Hey so whatever happens this week just remember it‚Äôs only money and you are loved. Bulls, bears, we‚Äôre all humans in the end and I care about all of you. Love yourself and if you take a loss (cough cough bulls this week and past weeks) don‚Äôt fret. It‚Äôs numbers on a screen :)

I think Intel has an R&D budget that Nvidia or AMD doesn't come near. They've had a rough year but even if they have to start outsourcing their manufactiring(like AMD) they'll get their technology back to superior levels. They've also made several acquisitions for new, high-tech, fast growing fields of chips. FPGA's with Altera, and several AI and AI enhancing type acquisitions. I believe they will regain their technological advantage in the next few years and have fast growing revenue in new fields of chip technology.

No it's not free money, but those lines are way off considering the polling. Most polls are indicating a 90% chance of a Biden win (which would be a -900 betting line), while the -190 odds represent a 65% implied probability. Definitely value in there if you believe the polling, although we all know polling isn't always accurate. 

But I think I may have found some actual "free money" based on an arbitrage opportunity. I'm drunk so bear with me and please correct me if I'm wrong. Bovada is currently offering this line: 

**Will The Winner Of The Popular Vote Also Win The Electoral College?** 

**Yes: -350**

**No: +245**

While I think there is a chance Trump wins the election, I think there is next to zero chance he wins the popular vote. That means you can basically get Trump to win the election at +245. If you can take Trump to win the election at +245, and Biden to win the election at -190, you can arb for literal free money. The only way you don't win is if Trump wins the electoral college *and* the popular vote. Here is the math:

**Bet $1900 on Biden to win at -190. Risking $1900 to win $1000**

**Bet $840.58 on NO (Winner of PV also win EC?) at +245. Risking 840.58 to win $2900**

**Total risk: $2740.58**

**Biden wins (EC): You profit $159.42**

**Trump wins (EC but not PV): You win $159.42**

&#x200B;

Thoughts?
I think Biden win (at least in short term) is > virus worries and anything other negative. 

If Trump wins. Last time around markets rallied on this news, this time around, if he wins again, puts will be the right move.
so you're saying the result is irrelevant?
Tesla is gonna be the John Deere of consumer cars.

Yes but I think it'll be more than offset by the increased turnout by blacks and Hispanics over 2016. Texas is insane right now with their turnout and Hispanics who didn't vote last time are a big reason why, even if a slightly bigger percentage vote for Trump than 2016 Biden will still run it up on the sheer volume

Also, in response to your point earlier about gun bans in other countries, from what I understand their gun violence decreases but then other violent crimes like stabbings climb. Unfortunately in America, violence is so ingrained in our culture, I feel like this would be the case here also. Either way, I respect your views on the issue.

Very familiar with guns. My whole family is military, my father hunts,and I've gone to ranges many times in the day shooting with buddies. I'm not against guns. I have even shot assault rifles. I'm also not bat shit crazy. Some people are. And a handgun is much harder to shoot multiple targets with than an assault rifle which you know if you shoot. Most people are going to struggle to kill a few people with a handgun before another person would take them out. Which school shooting or mass shooting in the US do you need me to point to. I have lists.

long one short another. You can make it market neutral to gain exposure to the differences in performance between the two. You can also lopside the ratios for overall market exposure too. It's easiest with shares, but you can do it with options too, but that's tricky since you have to juggle the greeks and that shouldn't be your first pairs trade play.
No... I begged idiots here to buy calls.... You don't have to be an idiot... That was by far the most brain dead easy thing to do....

Buy the dip... 

Not short the massive dip... Man.... 

Investing bought the dip and wsb should have murdered their returns with call options and instead burned themselves with puts waiting for a second leg that made no fucking sense.

It's like you guys heard "be fearful when others are fearful and buy puts!"

Edit: people here literally decided to fight the fed... How fucking stupid can you be to try to fight a central bank...
I respectfully disagree for several reasons. I don‚Äôt believe there is any reason for me not to be able to own a so called ‚Äúweapon of war‚Äù. These are no different than many available hunting rifles in any way other than their ‚Äúscary appearance‚Äù. I enjoy casually shooting for fun, as do many other hundreds of thousands of Americans. I‚Äôm okay with background checks, I‚Äôm okay with mental stability checks, prior offense checks/restrictions, etc. what I‚Äôm NOT okay with is someone restricting my second amendment rights. The simple fact of the matter is a handgun could do just as much harm as one of these ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù everyone is so worried about, and on top of that they‚Äôre more easily concealable. 

Also, genuine question again, are you from the US? Familiar with guns?
Something smells metallic, am I having a stroke?

I even put forward a testable prediction ‚Äì if Trump wins the electoral college and loses the popular vote again, Lichtman will say he was right anyways like he did in 2000.

Is it stupid to think a Biden win might slow a vaccine? If a vaccine is 30% effective Trump would roll it out saying ‚Äúthe cure is here‚Äù.

This has been the longest weekend in the history of weekends. Maybe ever.
Look, nobody is saying they want to take your guns. However, assault weapons have no place in the hands of regular joe's. These are tools of war. The UK, Japan, Germany, Australia, etc. All have passed responsible gun legislation and have dramatically reduced gun homicides. In a perfect world, every gun owner would be responsible, and mentally stable. That's not the case. And banning the sale of these style of weapons would make it much more difficult for those criminals to get those guns, even if they still can obtain them. And making their sale illegal would also make them less desirable. Do you need an assault rifle to protect yourself? How many times have you needed to take out an entire theatre full of people?

Riots are now a part of our society and can happen at any time 

In blue states
I'll go synthetic long if I'm feeling pretty frisky about a stock going up, but short put and then short call has made me plenty of money. Certainly kept me well ahead of spy these last 2 months, and I'd be much farther ahead if it wasn't for one position I admittedly got too emotional about and now have to baghold my shares

I just followed the money into some December calls which came up on my radar. Whale bet of 700k and another 1.7M for June 2020 both in the 80s strike range. I admit I jumped on it a bit too quick and didn‚Äôt follow my rule of the contract to have profited at least 10% before buying.
Vaccine updates: hospitals are registering for vaccines. Astra zenica and Abbott are the two that will be available likely before year end.

One of these has to be stored in a -4 degree fridge ( which few places have enough to hold the dosages)

No word on efficacy of these vaccines yet. They are hoping to start giving to healthcare by end of this month.

The NRA said Obama was taking them all, twice. And they said Bill Clinton was taking them all, twice. I think our guns are safe.
Hear me out guys, I‚Äôm big bear, but don‚Äôt expect the election to crash the market. At most, we‚Äôll see $305 on SPY and then a big recovery. 

The market won‚Äôt crash to March levels again until housing defaults rise and investors panic. Recessions take months to actually show their effects, so likely this won‚Äôt happen until mid-late 2021.

what‚Äôs a sigma?
Ah now we've come to the part of the evening where futures sell off because everyone is afraid of Europe
I have good thoughts
That's a fair point. Is there essentially always a bounce after 3 sigmas for indices and maybe commodities? Surely someone's already done the research on it.
Pins$ and snap$ have a bigger market cap than twitter...

the fuck ..

I wanna short pins$ to the ground 

But ....
Futures green means red day
Yikes.
Or Bo Jackson
Its hard to compare the trends from that time. Lots of things changed. Stimulus, Tech enabling daily works, covid recovery..... It wont be that bad of a drop.
/GC or /SI. Cut through the bullshit.
sorry, an app that acquired some other apps, better?

And the polls. And sanity.

It really doesn't matter. Bigger problems in the market.

If 4-6 week puts should print.

You just go to www.UpSolve.org and they do all the paperwork and everything for you without the lawyer you just have to go to court.  I filed Ch. 7 this way and wiped 30k of debt all on my own
So your bullish position made you poor af?
Either way, Biden is bad for business in the long term. Maybe short term gains though

I've never felt more confident with an inverse because of a single post. You're reasoning is that you've never listened to anything these candidates have said in the past l and now that you've heard Trump speak, you realized he wants to make America great again. And because of this realization SPY is going tits up? And you think it's going tits up because now we will make stuff in America? Jesus this sub is insane. Kid doesn't know what tits up means and we should be listening to him.
The market is doing the opposite of what genius bears think? It took a lot of mental effort on their part to conclude market is going down because election and Covid. They must‚Äôve thought they were the only ones thinking about this
I‚Äôve heard TDS can be quite rough on the ol‚Äô coronary, I‚Äôll say a prayer for you, retard.

Good for them. You think anyone here knows what that is, or even what synthetic puts are or whatever they use? Covered shorts have made me enough money that I really don't care to go deeply into trying complex options strategies, it's simple and it works as long as you have some patience. Being covered fits my risk tolerance just fine

If put goes against me I'll collect my pennies on my calls until it recovers. Same risk as if I had just bought the shares instead of selling a put

EQT- Reversal pattern with ascending wedge

RRC

SWN

CNX - bull flag, reversal pattern

MCF - Low Cap play, CEO a billionaire buying cheap Oil/gas assets at bottom of market.

SM - may have bottomed but too early to tell. Great company

CWEGF- Small cap clean ESG Canadian play,

BIREf - bull flag, outside US

AAVVF- canadian,  small cap, overall great potential and looks like bottomed out

&#x200B;

Some of the above are USA but great companies that will survive. Also not sure if a Biden win will ban fracking completely which I don't think he will do, I think the business will be regulated heavily to become more ESG, which is what most of them are trying to do anyway. I think if anything he will ban flaring gas from crude oil drilling. I am also looking at this as a mid- long term swing trade... I probably wouldn't invest in this industry long term and the long term bullish fundamentals of NG might happen very slowly with lots of volatility in between. Same goes for all my commodity producers

Nope.Flip that graph and you will find wisdom.
Why you would ever hold a bearish position when the majority of the sub believes its a good idea is beyond me.

The one time you don't buy puts is when every person thinks it's a good idea.

You are playing checkers. 

The elite play chess. 

The Byedons have been trained to riot.
They've also been trained that their guy is winning(silent majority says otherwise). 

The elite need big issues with 2A rights so a good il left vs right boondoggle should do the trick to reduce more rights(controlavirus anyone?).

The right is too christian and passive to start a war. So the left has been duped into thinking they will win, all the while being trained to riot and spew hatred. 

The elite will get what they want. 
The citizens will not. 

Mango wins. Left riots. Gunfighting between left and right. White helmets and new laws and waaaaay less freedoms. 

Chess not checkers.
Ya some guy is lowballin the car at $65.

That's actually a great suggestion.  Problem with Bovada or other gambling sites is that once you win, you'll go splurging that bet on other things.  With a friend, you collect the money, he curses you out.  Done.  Talk about it for years.

Capital flight exists. It‚Äôs a globalized world economy, make the corporate tax rate 40-60% and watch how many companies leave America. And why wouldn‚Äôt they, would you work for 40 cents on the dollar? 

Not to mention, with all of the Marxist doctrine being spewed today, who do you think they‚Äôre going to target? The poor people? Go look up similar revolutions and read up on what happened to business owners and rich people. What‚Äôs the saying now? ‚ÄúEat the rich‚Äù? You think every wealthy American didn‚Äôt take Bernie‚Äôs popularity and doctrine seriously enough to consider where they would go if it reached its conclusion?

And don‚Äôt get me started on very peaceful protests destroying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of businesses.

I understand your sentiment, but if you think a presidents economic policy plays absolutely no role in the stock market you don‚Äôt know your ass from your elbow on the economy. Tax rates and regulation make or break businesses to the tunes of tens of thousands. Sure, the market will still go up, but if you‚Äôre one of those people who says trump just inherited Obama‚Äôs amazing economy you‚Äôre legitimately a dumb ass.

What WSB Thinks Will Happen: Extremely contested election that drags out until the end of the year at least combined with COVID which results in SPX <3000 and VIX >80. SPY puts and VXX calls print.

What Is Going to Happen: Election decided definitively by wednesday. Market flat to maximum -2% down EOW. IV crush from binary vol event obliterates all options but particularly WSB's way OTM SPY puts and VXX calls.

They've been programmed to. 
This tells you who the people in charge will pick to win also. 
The group that has been programmed to riot all summer is the group that has been told they are winning in the polls. 

It's also the group thats going to cry and melt into a puddle of tears before they go start rioting again when their guy loses. 

The writing is on the wall. It's all there.

I think you are absolutely wrong. Therefore, you must without doubt be right. At least according to my empirical data
I‚Äôm gonna cum
The obvious argument to this from a one month short term perspective is that if trump wins there are definitely going to be riots nationwide and the news channels will definitely be showing them. Riots cause fear and fear sells guns. Short term gun stocks are a great play - long term bad play if trump wins so agree with you at least partially but disagree with you on timing. There‚Äôs usually not the potential for violent riots when a republican wins.

No. Its better than going to a 50k school with no scholarship for an art degree. 

OP is out of touch with the majority of people. However theres plenty of scenarios where you could have 100k by 25. I actually did this calculation the other day and 100k by 25 is retirement at 45 so i guess we did the same math. 

If you go to college for a degree thats 100k out of a masters or undergrad, you got 100k if you dont buy a 500k house with a 100k down. And at that point it doesnt matter

If you go to tech or community college or trade school, youre on pace as they are generally cheap. 

If you work through college you can graduate debt free. But rip the best years. 

If you do stay at home to save 15k a year, that will many people to the threshold.


But thats not reality. Half of women have kids before theyre 27. Everyone at my job has cars out of their budget. Half of them dont even contribute to their 401ks at best and these are college educated people.

At the same time though inventories are low but prices have doubled on a lot of ar platforms. Guns that typically go for $799 in store with a $999 msrp are currently going for $2000+. Platforms like the Springfield armory saint usually go for under $1000 and the absolute minimum price I‚Äôve seen over the past four months from a place with it actually in stock has been closer to $1400 - just checked and they‚Äôre going for $2000 from the only place in stock. Not counting broker sites since those are mostly resale markets and the manufacturers don‚Äôt get anything out of that. Ammo prices have done the same thing and you can‚Äôt even get the primers or other materials needed to self reload. 


If Biden wins his proposed $200 tax/fine on all firearms and high capacity magazines will be a key selling point for the gun industry to raise prices further and moon (one of the main reasons anyone who owns a firearm and is middle class is unlikely to vote for him). If trump wins then at least through January the same thing will happen from all the crazy people rioting and everyone buying even more guns - just look at all the cities boarding businesses up in blue areas right now, that‚Äôs not being done in case Biden wins. 


Literally smartest thing you can do right now is buy gun stocks like $RGR (whose ar-556 platform is one of the only ones that‚Äôs been kept in stock pretty well due to their manufacturing capability so they can in fact continue to make sales). Go look at places like rural king who actually keep their inventory levels up to date and you‚Äôll see why ruger is a good bet - they‚Äôre the only ones able to keep stuff in stock.

Obama/Biden had a pandemic playbook. I imagine we'd just start there
Sure, but how much is that a function of your bias and incomplete information?

I'm a moderate living in a very liberal area, my dad fucking loves Trump.  When we talk politics, I've never heard of half the things he claims the left believes.  For those that are true, 90%+ of people I've met believe them to 1/10 the degree that he thinks.  Except hating Trump, that's about dead on.

Speaking of riots and bias, [93% of protests were peaceful, but 42% of people polled believed most people protested with the intent to incite violence](https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/).  Nevermind weird shit that was widely reported by protestors and barely, if at all by news outlets like random pallets of bricks nearby protest sites and a flooding of people from out of town.

One thing Trump got right: the mainstream media is bullshit.  Where he's wrong is that Fox is included in this.  We're in a shitty spot right now where all widely consumed news is extremist, the loudest voices are extremists, and the silent majority is moderates who just want to get past the bullshit.

TLDR: We'll definitely see protests if Trump gets elected, but I doubt there will be much if any rioting.  I will expect riots if Biden is reported as the winner and Trump doesn't step down.

These motherfuckers literally printed a billion dollars, they are the original autists.

Realistically it'll be more of the same. The federal government can enact a nationwide mask mandate but who's enforcing that in bumfuck nowhere? Are we going to lock people up for not wearing masks? We might get more restrictions and federal requirements for businesses (like Biden's plexiglass requirement for restaurants) but if these are on top of local and state requirements you'll see an even higher failure rate of restaurants and other service/tourism businesses as they're struggling to stay open as is.
Jesus christ, have you guys seen DC? It looks like a war is ready to break out. Rip stock market

Can some of you impatient fucks not wait two days for election results or do you really feel the need to spew your political bs here?
Honestly I position everything for next week and into Christmas. The reason is today and tomorrow will probably price in some overreaction. So I probably wouldn't touch anything expiring this week, if you plan to get in tomorrow morning. 

Next week until January will give people time to react and absorb reality.
I love how people keep saying Trump contests the results. Odds are the election is close and *Democrats* contest the results as they have been since the day orange man bad got elected. 

The real danger is that trump put in his Supreme Court nominee and if it does go to the courts people will literally burn down cities.
Infinite QE argues otherwise

If Trump loses, he's going to salt the country.

Seriously, people think it's a joke. The worst outcome is literally a Biden win, without a sweep in congress. It's not a Biden or Trump vicotry, both are relatively stable for traders or at least moderately predictable for traders. However, Biden win without a sweep is fucked because obstructionism is unpredictable, and this outcome is a real possibility.

We have already acknowledged a few things, they will release stimulus instantly they dont want this shit dead,
If it does we know the obvious plays, and get rich as fuck

If they do none of this and it crashes we get deflation and our money is worth more wins all across

Biden wins means delay to stimulus. But stable gains over the long run.

Trump wins means bigly gains in the short run, leading to an eventual bubble bursting. 

Basically ride your gains for round 2, or reposition for the long haul on the reset.

He misinterpreted a confusing study about restaurant dining and covid spread where masks were asked about. Sure, he spread misinformation but I think more than likely he's not a scientists and he misinterpreted rhe study.

They even say in the article you linked how the study could be misinterpreted.

>A key problem with the ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt stop the spread‚Äù claim: The data was self-reported through phone surveys. In other words, people told the interviewers about their mask use; it wasn‚Äôt observed through video monitoring.
‚ÄúYou can imagine that there may be some inaccuracies in the reporting of it,‚Äù Rice said.

The cdc also said masks aren't intended to protect the wearers.


>The¬†CDC guidance on masks¬†says wearing a mask is intended to protect other people in case the mask wearer is infected. ‚ÄúAt no time has CDC guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers,‚Äù the agency spokesperson said in the statement.


So again how could trump have stopped the spread? 

European countries had strict lockdown and mask rules and they are having a large second wave.

A hedge fund selling most options will sell to an options dealer as well, who has no interest in exposure to the underlying (in part due to regulation, but also because they‚Äôre not scuicidal). 

Obviously, option dealers can and do lose when the underlying moves abruptly, since they can‚Äôt place an infinite number of trades to perfectly gamma hedge. The important thing to understand though, is that for the most part, options trades (longs and shorts) have a delta-neutral party on the other end. That‚Äôs the root of concepts like MM gamma exposure

Nope, they will pump it after the election
Yeah but its not hard to figure it out. Oil will tank with a biden win. And it might rise a bit but I doubt it will moon with a trump win. It will prob moon when the pandemic  is declared over.

This sub used to have a standard.
Michigan governor was antifa who wanted to pose as the right.  And if you really want to know how many deaths and beatings happened at left protests you can find it (assuming your search engine didn't scrub that).  You must not have been watching social media during those left protests or you would already know.

Today stands to remain true that the right protests are truly "mostly peaceful" in fact 100% peaceful until someone attacks them.  Like that white van that rammed someone in the Trump train in Texas
Still not the point of the sub tho. Shit is annoying af

Trump is an erratic, dangerous, and totally ignorant human being. I cannot understand why anyone would vote for him.

I think you‚Äôre underestimating how often hedges sell calls or puts. Want to buy a stock at a certain price and get paid to do it? Sell puts. Are you knowingly about to deflate the position? Sell calls and buy puts before you start your sell off. Not all options on high frequency trading platforms are filled by the bank, and hft platforms can still lose significant capital quickly on a 0 delta trade.

Because they didn't actually need 30k ventilators.  

Cuomo said they needed 140k hospital beds and tens of thousands of ventilators but only needed 18,000 beds and less than 4000 ventilators.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/ny-projections-on-beds-ventilators-were-off-couldnt-model-love-spirit-cuomo-says/ar-BB12s24y

So you still haven't explained what trump could have done to reduce the number of cases. Ventilators and ships were after the fact.

Next week, everyone will remember where they were when the mother of IV combines with theta to kill everyone.
 I think people severely underestimate the power of liquidity. March apocalypse was mainly due to liquidity crisis. Since then we have got flooding liquidity into financial system. Which is precisely why whenever we get a solid dump dip buyers emerge and take us back to 340.

Lol the consumer index and house sales with a declining job numbers still off the damn chart is bullish enough to push us to ath? Lock down fears didn't do shit then, and these are all in Europe anyways right now. We've already firmly reacted to stimulus, and while I expect uncertainty elections aren't gonna give you your circuit breakers.

Not that I give a shit, Im theta gang, I'll sell puts or calls depending on the day. You're just absurd for your absolute certainty in something that has hardly been behaving rationally.
Sir this is not smallstreetbets
Apple is heading to a downward trend. Which is common for companies that gained alot of market cap due to stock split. Apple nearly beat earnings and is lose Iphone sales in China. This is all indicating downward movement. I own 2 million worth of Apple shares I bought in early 2000s. I want it to go up but instead I just sell covered calls as it declines.

That wouldn't be the election. That's just something that could happen any random day of the year. Apple isn't worth 15% less because oh, the election happened... It's fucking apple... People buy iPhone... 

Microsoft isn't worth 15% less after the election. What you're going to stop using fucking office and windows?

The average trader is beyond retarded.  If it does. Drop 15-30% buy.... Because it doesn't make sense. And corrects, just like fucking March.

Something REAL has to happen. War, trade, etc. 

It's like people can't look at a chart of the market and see it always fucking goes up. Republicans =/ business. Jesus you think business people only buy one party? How people are blind to this still and still are obsessed with "their party" winning is idiotic.... We are really painfully easy to manipulate.

>The COVID-19 pandemic spread to the US navy hospital ship USNS Mercy when its first case was reported on 8 April 2020. It is unclear how the crew member became infected, as the crew member had not interacted with any patients, all crew members had been screened before boarding the ship in San Diego and had not been allowed to leave the ship since, and the ship was only treating patients for ailments other than COVID-19, requiring a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result before any patient was allowed to board the ship.

>As of 14 April 2020, 7 medical staff members had tested positive, and the Navy had removed 116 medical staff members from the ship in response.

Stop with your bullshit. There's no evidence covid patients were sent there. Neither was there any evidence the crew members were infected by patients.

He‚Äôs talking about the comments. Filled with people unable to even comprehend a different perspective.
>Besides casting their votes for the presidential election, voters in Oregon this week will decide on decriminalizing hard drugs via a ballot initiative called Measure 110. The bill would decriminalize personal possession of less than one gram of heroin or methamphetamine; two grams of cocaine; 12 grams of psilocybin mushrooms; 40 doses of LSD, oxycodone or methadone; and one gram or five pills of MDMA.

Not sure why you are getting down voted. Biden Harris ticket is what the riots should be about. Two people that have made significant impact on the incarceration of young black men. It baffles me that these two are being peddled as the saviors of the disenfranchised.

I don't see police and the protest changing with the President so we should be ready for riots no matter what. Only difference is that now the governors will be more likely to contain them.

Don't let anyone disrespect you like that, ever. If you let them, you'll tell yourself that they're right and you'll lose your self respect. This goes for women, friends, family, work place.

There are different ways to handle it, but the bottom line is don't just take it. Personally for this one I would just cut the group. After 10 years, sounds like these guys just aren't worth it. Also, that's a cruel thing to say - not somebody I would want in my life anyway. Or you can talk about it. Or you can be introspective (though even if you can change some things, I still think the guy was out of line and probably worth cutting).

Gun control and the fear of gun control is what typically drives up gun sales. The thing with guns is that they aren't really a wearable item for most people. You can have guns last for generations so why buy more guns? The reason is fear of guns becoming illegal. This happens when Democrats are in power or are challenging for office.

This year has been even wilder due to COVID-19 and the riots. If Trump and Republicans win then gun rights will be safe and demand will drop until the next major event such as riots or elections.

Look at my post history, I've been telling you monday would be green all weekend. Anyone who wanted to sell before the election would have did it Friday, election is going to go smoother than everyone thinks and then we'll start a hard bull run for the next couple of months with optimism of an even bigger stimulus than before, book it. Nov 20 calls are gonna print.
Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous. All these people that call for lockdowns won‚Äôt be effected at all. I‚Äôm WFH until 2022 and I‚Äôm set, but I don‚Äôt blame any of these small businesses that just take the loan and close up‚Äî holding on to the government cash.

It‚Äôll be less harmful to the market in the long term than half the states (specifically, the blue ones, a.k.a. the ones whose economies are worth a shit) going into lockdown anyway, for even longer, because orange man plugged his ears and screamed until we had 200,000 new cases every day, resulting in the hospitals being overrun (which causes a significant increase in the rate of fatality). THAT is the Trump market come 2021 if his ass is still steering this godforsaken ship.

Polling is different this time around. On top of that there's very few swing voters like there was in 16.  It's going to be all about turnout and that seems to be trending to the Dems. Republicans have their base. They're loud and most importantly they vote in very high percentages. The problem is Trump has not grown that base in his 4 years, and the soft supporters he did have in 16 have swung to Biden. Mostly referring to older white voters.

The only unforseen circumstance that will allow Trump to win is if his support among black and Latino youth is vastly understated, and if those groups show up in record numbers. Somehow Trump has gotten a decent amount of growth from them.

The simple fact is Trump has to win all 4 states that Biden has strong and steady leads in (NC, FL, AZ, and PA) and prevent Biden from winning any one of Texas, Ohio, and Georgia which only have 2 or 3 point Trump leads. He's going to have to cheat. I just don't see any way around it.

Oh wait they were too busy trying to start a war.

That would be sad. Do disagree tho, it‚Äôs been following the market with no indication of individually being targeted to sell.  If the market goes back up, so will apple.

> I think he only invited me cause like 5 years ago, we all did a dance for my sister's wedding

you've been an outsider for 5 years with this group?

either you're putting them off, or they don't like you for whatever reasons, or both

if you want to get closer to them, talk about it with them. tell them you feel excluded

otherwise, find another group
You‚Äôre only an outsider if you act like an outsider. This type of thing is the perfect opportunity to change all that and grow a meaningful bond with these guys...

Unless you actually don‚Äôt like them as people and you see no benefit in maintaining those relationships. If that‚Äôs the case then opt out of the dance and never look back again

If you declare bankruptcy, there is a maximum amount of money you can make each year, and you wont be able to get so much as a credit card, never mind a vehicle loan or house loan for like 7 years.

This means you will be guaranteed to be living on like 25k a year, no matter how fuckin smart you might be.

We had a record hot year. Hottest year in the past 100. I am a big optimist though, so I like to think of it as the coolest year in the next 100 years :3

Oil is going to the dirt. I'm  pretty far from an analyst, I'm just speculating
the dip already happened last week, the market now reacts 1 week early
Lol I‚Äôm seeing a lot comments about ‚Äúx is about to happen‚Äù, however, it‚Äôs already happened and the market already priced it in. Someone said something about Germany locking down but this was announced last week. No one here has a clue what‚Äôs gonna fucking happen.
With oil down other currency‚Äôs that are somewhat based with oil is down as well leading the dollar up.
Tis true.
What happened in 1987 that caused this

Some of the Trump supporters are "ignorant racist proud boys and not normal people", and some of them certainly are crazy enough to be rioting.
It's all good man. We are all a community here. All trying to claw ourselves back from the massive losses we've taken. 

You opt out and don't be a part of a group that doesn't want you. It's never worth it to do that

Amazon only has 498 million outstanding shares. Aapl has 16.977 billion.
Honestly no, alot of this rally came from confidence that the fed can do anything. If we continue to crash then investors will lose confidence in the fed.

Whole selloff felt like that past Thursday after tech beat big tbh. Seemed like a sell off to induce fear and big money swooping in to to take cheap shares after the chaos. Sell now retail so you can buy high later!!!

This seems extremely stupid to just "get a loan to pay it off".  

It is not hard at all to fake paying it off.  Get an "auto loan", buy a shit car, then use that money left over like 3 payments to pay off student loans.  Do the same thing but with a credit card, and so on and so forth.  Dont be like 1.  Take out 100k loan.  2.  Pay 100k to student debt people.  That's too easy to prove lol.  Ruin your credit in various ways over the course of about a year, and pay it all off, then itll make your lawyers job waaaaay easier to not have to argue what he was doing.  The idea is to make it hard to find the money.
Casino royale
I'm kind of the outsider in a group of friends. One of the guys is getting married and asked guys to dance at his wedding. A few said no and like 10 said yes. So he made 2 teams of 5 so we get 2 dances...we all kind of joke around and like I said I consider myself kind of the outsider of the group..but yesterday he came to our first practice to set everything up and here's the punchline... He replies jokingly at sometime in the night "oh man I'm just here to watch..you guys run the show and do whatever dance you want..you can even disclude "says my name" from the dance if you want.. "everyone gives a slight laugh" i put on the fakest smile and man... I'm thinking of opting out. I felt so disrespected. Thanks for reading. Left out a lot of minor details but this is  a big decision for me. I think he only invited me cause like 5 years ago, we all did a dance for my sister's wedding...so he felt obligated to invite me to be part of the dance. I haven't told this to anyone but I'm posting here IDK WHY

might happen but I think personally it's going to be a landslide if the polls are only different by less than 15 percent and we know which side is not going to admit their affiliation/be more likely to vote in person.
dont lie, youd let pelosi urinate on you then slurp up the box spread...
Well it seems like more people on WSB think Biden will win, so statistically speaking it‚Äôs going to be Trump by a landslide...
