Weed stocks were creating a new market whereas EVs are expanding on/bettering a current market.  If you can‚Äôt tell the difference then you deserve to miss out on the gains.

I figured it out:

While Dow and S&P Futures are red, Nasdaq Futures remain green based on TSLA opening at 530
Kinda annoying tbh

Nothing is speaking to me, I should be all over DLTR since I called it last time but now I'm not so sure...
Well goddammit! Getting in before WSB does is pure magic.

This is true.  However, another issue that Momentus has is that their CEO is not a US citizen.   Why does this matter?  Because rockets are considered national security and technologically sensitive.  Their Russian CEO isn't even allowed to see the technology that the company has.  The dumbest part - he invented half of it.  I'm not making this shit up.

I'm getting RKT vibes from this  - old company, long established book of business and business model, nothing fundamentally different from other companies competing in its sector, unlike PLTR which uses AI and big data and other buzzwords to do all kinds of stuff that's never been done before. Also, no CEO with crazy hair, no PayPal Mafia. It'll be a good steady grower because it's a big company with huge corporate and government clients, but it won't see explosive growth.

In comes MSFT and GOOG. PLT and CSCO have the major baller systems. AMZN, RNG, Mitel, VZ, LogMeIn, and others are already established and offer a bigger suite.

The underlying means the underlying stock. The option is never underlying. 

What you need to do is set the graph to say $2 and $40 (reflecting the scenario where PSTH stock price goes up, not down) and then it'll be more accurate.

It‚Äôs a spac, but not just any spac. It only has 1 month to complete a merger or it liquidates and delists, which means we are very likely to get a merger announcement in the coming few weeks. You won‚Äôt have to bag hold this thing for 6 months hoping for a merger. They are also rumored to be deep in talks with company Microvast, which sells fast charging batteries for electric vehicles. What happens to EV spacs whenever a merger is announced? Moon. What is the downside? Minimal. The stock is trading at $10.30 which means you are only risking 3% with a tremendous upside potential. You might even want to hold long term if they get a great merger like Microvast.

Firstly, if the acquisition falls through, PSTH pays back $20 (the issued price) for every share. This minimizes the loss and almost ensures that it doesn‚Äôt go under $20 per share. Also, this SPAC could possibly be the biggest acquisition ever.

Um...because writing an algorithm and following data science models will be alot easier to make money in the market? Let me know when you find a success story.
Well, writing covered calls requires you have 100 shares of the stock against which you write (create) and sell a call option. You're agreeing to sell the 100 shares at the strike price for a number of cents per share. This requires sufficient capital to own 100 shares of something. You can do this every week.

Cash-secured puts are similar, in that you have sufficient cash in the account to purchase 100 shares of the stock. You write a put contract and agree to purchase 100 shares at the strike price (probably lower than today's price). You sell the put contract for a number of cents per share.

Both of these tactics require significantly more capital, but are "safer" than just buying options. For me, the results of selling a call or put option are win/win. Either I keep the premium upon sale when the option expires worthless, or I sell-get called (or buy-get put) the stock at a profit (or discount) that I already know I'm happy with.

Yes, this takes more capital. But can easily generate 0.5-1% return every week. That adds up over time. The element of ruin isn't as severe as buying call/puts. If you are young, your biggest commodity is time. Use it to your advantage. 

I've tried everything else. This is what works for me.

You should read a lot more, watch youtube videos, and maybe trade a simulated account before trying real money. There are people who have killed themselves over their losses. Don't lose your humanity over this.

Check out the r/investing and r/thetagang subs. This sub is informative and entertaining, but you have to sift through tons of shit to find a pearl of wisdom.

Good luck.

Its more like, you've known about PLTR for years because who the fuck hasn't heard of the sketchy shit they're into, so you buy after the direct listing because you know, hey, this is basically a CIA stonk, I'm not betting against this.

Basically, if a WSB post is telling you to buy calls or puts on some shit, and this is the first time you're hearing of the stonk or the DD or whatever, stay away. When you're holding something WSB starts memeing, time to be worried- but there is meme magic potential.

you have absolutely no capacity to consider long term issues.
Nothing worse than going on a date with a hot chick and her having a dead tooth. It fucks up the whole vibe. You try to ignore it, you tell yourself dude, she‚Äôs hot we‚Äôre having a good time, it‚Äôs not a big deal. Then you get a waft of that stank ass tooth and it completely crushes your mojo. Then you make out and you have to fight the urge to get the fuck out of there finally drowning yourself in booze like the goddamn alcoholic you are.

High growth large companies such as Apple, Facebook, amazon, google, Tesla, Uber, ect, ect. Are only trading at 100s time PE (and forward PE in some cases) because discount rates are so low that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre discounting earnings back 10 years. It‚Äôs only when inflation hits that interest rates will rise and tank the house of cards. I‚Äôm sorry to tell you that you‚Äôve jumped the gun. Once inflation comes, the market will topple

I wouldn't take this trade. Sure there's potential for downside, but the holders of this stock are buffet boys who care about the real estate assets and the long term value there. 

MTN owns some of the best real estate in the world. Not to mention it's already a fairly socially distant activity outside lifts/lines. They managed to run Whistler this summer without issues in Canada and that was without allowing US customers due to travel restrictions.

Can I buy calls on your IQ? I don't think it can go any lower.

I don‚Äôt know much about the company tbh. I just like the way the chart is setting up for a big move to the upside. I highly doubt the 100$+ move up on last earnings was logical. I only got to ride puts on the way down. This time I want to get the gains on the way up and down.
You fool you could have turned that -30% to +1000% then -234%
Market will be green or slightly down futures are sideways
Already baked in.  The announcements alone pushed us higher.  Who assumed then that fda would not approve to limit the rise?
The biggest thing they have going for them are their piles of cash. If they can pivot into tech or acquire something, then who knows...

Let winners run. Cut losers short. 

Problem we try to time tops and bottoms which 99.99% of us can not do consistently. 

Result? By holding losers and not holding winners. We are always playing catch-up. Either do both or don‚Äôt do either one. 

Since we can‚Äôt time tops and bottoms, we see our option dip in value and we hold, sometimes it goes back up and we sell immediately to take profits. I mean why not? We were losing and now it‚Äôs in the green so sell!

Other times, it just keeps going in the red and we hold. A trade like this will offset many small gains.
You‚Äôre wrong from me but that‚Äôs also why I‚Äôd never be in that position in the first place

Maybe this was doomed from the beginning or it was designed to go the big boys only.

Only trying to help, you can always read the SEC filing. The floor is still intact at this point. As much as we all love loss porn I‚Äôd way rather see you yolo into something that has actual potential for a ten bagger

Exactly, this is all bullshit. We been having months after months with protests and Covid didn't spike and the Gov didn't give a damn about that, now the problem is staying open after 10pm, give me a fucking break. What does it matter if im at a restaurant or a bar, on my own table with my buddies or family, social distanced from other tables and outdoors, before 10 or after 10pm, what difference does it make. We already not allowed to have bars open indoors or be close to other people that are not in our group.

You can say that again, I better buy some calls.

Eh, their cloud computing isn't *that* advanced tbh
Any one here holding EOS energy?
They make zinc hybrid batteries which are cheaper than lithium ion batteries, fire proof, don‚Äôt explode like lithium batteries and have longer discharge period. They are particularly useful for power grids and they have installed their batteries in few grids and even made few agreements with some grids in USA especially California grids.
The positive thing is it‚Äôs USA company and made in USA ( Pittsburgh).
It completed SPAC reverse merger few days ago.
Nobody tell him

I‚Äôd look into SPACs a little more, shares can be cashed out at $22 so that‚Äôs a pretty solid price floor. Once your done bleeding your only chance to profit is he announces someone other than Stripe cause the sell off will be legendary.

Yikes, yeah, some dude posted a pic of his half million shares of NKLA, RIP him.
Yes they should so they can point themselves in the right direction to get out of poverty

Yup. Also could argue there's enough free capital right now that the volume alone won't let the overall indexes crash. Just constant rotation

Pretty long time. Safe but long. Problem with an account that size is you have to take losses depending on which tickers you play. If you have enough capital to actually just hold 100 shares of Tesla then you can basically not lose money wheeling it, but for you you'd have to take some risk or play AMD or a smilar ticker for meager gains or something.

Honestly in this stupid market you‚Äôre spot on. The key is buying the spy puts dated at least a couple weeks out and not paper handing on the green rallys (even when they last a few days). We have been so up and down because of the volatility of the world right now ‚Äî any piece of news sends the market haywire. Even if your timing isn‚Äôt perfect you can profit on both sides. 

Anyway, i hope it all ends soon and you get to be social again. Best of luck, friend.
Remind me! 1 week
No different than options lol. But if you take an interest to it and do your homework you‚Äôll do well and realize it‚Äôs all simple. I remember I would hours scrolling every steroid forum. From chats long dead from like 2002. Taking notes and learning as much as I could.

In my opinion the market is desperate for places to invest. It‚Äôs buying value at any sign of solvency because tech has such shit inflated prices, and then rotates right back to tech at the first signs we aren‚Äôt recovering.

Must buy PUMP
Of those companies ads are really only relevant for Facebook/Google and are offset by increased time on the platform from people who still have their high skill, high paying jobs and are just working from home (most consumers). Q3 earnings for those companies showed even with restrictions, ad spending has bounced back. After all, if people can‚Äôt leave the house after 10PM to go to the bar/restaurants they‚Äôll stay home watch Netflix, browse social media and stare at ads, and spend the money they would‚Äôve blew at the bar to buy things from Amazon/Etsy/Shopify based on ads they saw on Instagram/Pintrest using Paypal. Instead of going to the gym they‚Äôll order Pelotons. They might even order a Tesla since they can‚Äôt take public transit anymore.

Yes there‚Äôll be an overall decrease in spending due to the loss of jobs by low wage restaurant/bar/local business workers, but that‚Äôs actually a net positive for the stock market because the rest of the spending from the people who still have jobs is being redirected from local business that don‚Äôt trade on the stock market to a small handful of companies that do. Money will rotate out of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and back into tech, but the overall market valuation/index will increase (not the Dow and Russel ofc) and then when a vaccine comes some money will flow back into value and the market might correct if money starts flowing back into small businesses.

The biggest risk to the markets are probably to banks due to loan defaults and low interest rates, which could have a ripple effect to the market, I‚Äôll give you that. If airlines/cruise lines start declaring bankruptcy and the government isn‚Äôt willing to bail them out that would also be a problem.

Hedge funds ya dingus. Manipulating futures pricing is literally hedge fund 101. It's a low-volume environment that affects the actual equities market, so it's the best place to manipulate price action. Every single hedge fund on earth with over 10 mil or so in liquidity does this. And you can just watch the order flow and see it happen in real time. Not sure why you are acting like I am a butt-hurt conspiracy theorist when this is open information and not a secret.

I actually look at fidelities key statistics tab on the main options page to see top orders for the day. It‚Äôs definitely a lagging indicator but cool to see what the big guys are doing. 

Thoughts on AMZN calls? I feel like these times of ‚Äúsleepy amzn‚Äù is when IV can come down and you can take a shot a monster gains if/when it takes off.
This logic is faulty. With the interest rates being super low, most people who can afford homes and were on the fence are buying one (mortgage lower than rent) and the ones owning are refinancing (further reducing payments). Reduced inventory cause of demand increases price not because it's a bubble. The checks are longer and more rigid than 2008 so it's not a bubble. Will there be homes on the market next year cause of Covid job losses? Most certainly, but with the fed committed to not increase rates, for every seller there will be a buyer. Even in 2010/2011 when the effects of recession hit and homes were at a  50% discount, they sold out and appreciated considerably in the next few years

You say it‚Äôs not money because it isn‚Äôt being added into circulation but that money allows them to lend more money because the feds money is collateral. Isn‚Äôt that extra money they can now loan out more money being added into circulation ? Am I missing something ?
Why?
zoom boomafoo
I bought. 140k volume on the 500c expiring tomorrow. Too much interest to not have a gamble. Thats a lot of shares MMs had to buy to hedge.

It's always crazy to me when there is this insane AH movement, then futures just go dead flat.

You'd think something would be happening rn, but nope
It will be tangentially through Starlink at some point, which is the only reason I‚Äôm trying to make tendies now. Gonna throw everything at that IPO when it happens.
PLTR going to moon tmrw?
word on the street from people not retarded is that some big player is keeping the stock down. they're selling virtually all the options and reaping the premium. when they want it to go up, they will let it. the financials and success of this company over the past year has zero correlation to the stock price.
Nice, you got this man! Can I have the honor of selling them to you please?

Ya...have you googled an image of those things. It will definitely make you second guess any thoughts of putting money Into it.
This thing is not a car. It‚Äôs technically a motorcycle since it has three wheels. It‚Äôs like a motorcycle with a sidecar. If it were a car (with four wheels) different regulations would apply for it to be street legal. 

This thing was built like this to lower production costs. It looks like a car but it‚Äôs really a tricycle.

I can agree it's going up in the long term. But people who think it's rocketing up in the matter of days are delusional.

Oh, but I guess this is WSB.
Here's the thing though. Any stock choice can be explained in a convincing way; knowing why somebody chose the stock they chose doesn't necessarily help you that much. It's the process of sorting the genuine promise from the hype, and then evaluating that promise, that makes bets good. And that's a much, much harder skill to communicate.

sell off was earnings coinciding with general market selloff and death of ipo hype, perfect storm to bring it down. It's being kept so low because tutes get to buy more shares for cheap while selling loads of options to idiots like me and OP who see this is a great company to invest in. Yes, the billion buyback should increase the price substantially, but I think they're sort of holding back for now to see how big the sell-off is when lockup period ends in feb.

My parents are deaf and my dad can barely form English sentences yet ran away from home at 16, was class president in college, worked for IBM when they were Facebook, quit and started his own company, has been making six figures ever since, invented the fucking red lights at the DC metro, and put $25,000 on Apple in 2003 and guess how much the fuck that is now.

Still, he thinks Trump is a 'moderate' and says the same shit fifty seven times a day, so I have to remind myself that I'm not looking at a retard but a full-bore fucking resplendent autist.

Mom's a tard though.
I literally wet myself. Thank you.
Still waiting for robinhood to grace me with that beautiful 0DTE message.
I can't wait to see the collective orgasm over the DoorDash IPO.
Honestly, if playing options, there are 3 ways to go about it.  


1) You sell them to autists like the group here. Thetagang is an example. Selling puts intelligently has about an 85% likelihood of success, but your profits are limited to the premiums you receive. If you do it on a momentum stock and ride the wave up, while rolling  your contracts up as it increases, you can make a fortune (I made about 300k on SHOP in 2019 doing that). However, you need to pay attention to it as you can be forced to buy a stock that implodes and doesn't recover for a while, so it's REALLY important to follow it.  


2) You YOLO on calls/PUTS, making an all-in bet or two onto a stock or two that you REALLY like and that you're really confident will work out. Your bet doesn't need to be perfect, but it needs to be intelligent. EX: Don't buy 1000$ calls on TSLA expiring next friday, you're guaranteed to lose.  
BUT: if you buy 600$ Calls, if the stock runs up to 550 on Monday, you'd likely make like 30% on your investment. (Just be smart enough to sell the options before closing the position.)  


3) You buy long-dated calls moderately on stocks you like. Ex: You want to buy BABA, but don't want to risk more than 5000$, well buy 5000$ worth of options expiring in May, you could end up with 1 or 2 contracts, but that's like 100-200 shares, which "control" 25k worth of shares each. This'll limit your losses to the 5k you bet on the stock, but you still get to ride the upside.  


for 5k, you could buy 1-2x TSLA  Jan 21 550c, which have plenty of time value and will ride the wave if it keeps running.  


You could also make a bigger bet on PLTR or something else that has solid momentum to ride the wave.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps, good luck with your journey!

This is correct. My mom taught community college for one and a half semesters, as a hobby, and then gave up trying to teach hooting retards for no pay. And there's not a goddamn thing you people could teach her, besides a new appreciation for what the opposite end of the bell curve does with their investments.

Lol until you hit 35, then you're the now laid off boomer. But it really shows how people got snake bit. They believed that being middle management Chad's raining hell down on people and forcing the kids into gigs would benefit them forever.

Last year I talked with a boomer at a party who was just an arrogant turd. He loved shitting on kids saying they're lazy blah blah. I told him that dude companies love firing people his age and replacing them and their is no loyalty left anymore. Never did get his name or see if he's one of those laid off this time around but still never count those chicken tendies before you own the wendys. Otherwise you're working there

Who got BABA calls?
Everyone should. They're paid to analyze. It's far from perfect but the average of each of the analysts PT is a good way to gauge how the market feels about it. Example. Costco is basically at the PT so it probably has very little room to run from here, immediately priced in the special dividend. Even possibly a good short. If analysts start raising guidance I'd change course. This is just one factor tho..anyone that trades off 1 piece of info is a moron. If 5 things are telling me the same story, i'll buy it.
Im sorry but if they look like that...your uh... swimmers might be..... sinkers.

One of the methods used to axe expenditures is to eviscerate middle-management positions. These roles are primarily held by professionals who are primarily in the 40-years-old and higher range. The positions are either done away with or juniorized, in which mid-to-senior-level workers are replaced with younger employees with considerably less experience.

Cheeto-Jesus is going to continue to lay a minefield for sleepy‚Äôs crew. Afghanistan was the first move since B can‚Äôt touch it without political consequences. CARES disproportionately helps minorities and the poor and will be a bitch to fix w/o a dem majority. It expires in December so the market will limp along until then when it will dump hard without it. 

Step 3 will be Chyna. Guarantee it. He can easily institute requirements for transparency that Chyna would never be able to follow (including human rights requirements). Sleepy and the dems will have their hands tied. The likelihood of some move against chyna has been partially responsible for Baba‚Äôs stonk performance lately, since it will be one of the top targets. Chyna hasn‚Äôt engaged in mutual currency devaluation that every other major currency has, including the dollar. A move against Chyna is going to have major economic impacts, Cheeto knows it.

Yeah it‚Äôs been fucking my TZA calls up
Sir, this is a casino.
I think your understanding of what a daily chart is is incorrect.  A daily chart spans a timespan of weeks to years, depending on how much you zoom in and out.  It sounds like you're think of an intraday chart as a daily chart.  Daily charts have a resolution of one data point per day but a span of many days.

JFrog. They got many products like Artifactory which is an artifact repo. Xray for scanning vulnerabilities (not really familiar). and couple more sht. Their main thing is Artifactory and used in most IT companies. everyone is slowly transitioning from their old docker regiries, maven repos, npm repos to Artifactory.
I bought these EOD SO Maybe a -3% would be nice
Why do you say that?
Tech won't be as severely impacted given the nature of tech. But their customers who they rely on for ad dollars will be. 

Market is current overbought (even tech) if you look at the 10 year trend I'd expect tech to drop if the overall market does but to be safer than something like a cruise stock or retail chain

Papa musk said lidar bad
This is such a poor decision. I have the utmost respect for you.
I know right? I've never had leftover blow before. Bought too much I guess.
not Variation Separate, no, but a comment mentioning him a few minutes ago is what reminded me of the DD. I forgot the OPs name/post title.
Ya that‚Äôs right I think. It opened at 251 and now trading at 253.6 so up ~1% from open so still something! Supposedly that‚Äôs around 261.66 usd. Idk where others are getting 264+ from... (probably looking at the % up in HK and applying on that to our close which isnt right?)
Funniest shit with the music
Lol I mean 10% haha
Roblox to the moon!
The circle jerk is full
Lol tech futes flip positive
I thinking about a call on RIG I'm from this industry and they are one of the few that didn't file bankruptcy.  What do you all think???
I've got EL in my real portfolio, honestly, if you're going to bet on makeup/fragrances and stuff, I'd bet on EL. It hasn't stopped delivering.  


That said, for shorter trades, I doubt COTY will give you much, the big bounce off vaccine happened already. I mean, it could possibly double from here, but the risk/reward ratio isn't as appealing anymore.  


The two big bets I made recently: PLTR, Sold 90 puts (20x 17.50 12/4 30x 16.00 12/4 and 40x 17.5 12/11) and bought 10x 14c 11/20.  
Bought 100x 14p 12/11 as insurance. Net premium is about 7200k for 23,500 maximum risk. 30% maximum return isn't too shabby all things considered.

BPY: sold 50x 11p march 21, 50x 11p feb 21, 32x 16p Dec 20, 32x 17.5p Dec20 and 32x 19p Dec 20.  
All of the BPY puts are naked.
Except over here, the ICE is strong support that it keeps bouncing off of and your ball floats generally upward (stocks go generally upward)
I like this joke but bragging about money is wack
garbage lol
I‚Äôm still bag holding from ER.  (Sold a shit load of puts and took the shares,  real estate is still hot as shit right now even tho down cycle is coming).  Bought a lot of dec 28 calls.

My strategy is literally buy shares that you can afford, slow build on those until you have enough to make safe but profitable options calls. But for the sake of all that's holy learn how options work first if you don't know already. Here's a good video about them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HMm6mBvGKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HMm6mBvGKE)
Just be careful. Some downtowns might legit collapse

Roku fucking popped today and I heard no chatter on WSB
First off, I have only lost money with options, so I'm not good in any way. I can tell you that I stuck with mine for way too long when it was decreasing in value. If you notice that volume is winding down and the price is bleeding, I would get out for now. You have a decent amount of time, so just see where it goes for a few days.

I made the mistake not selling 300$ up. Securing profits will make you happier in the long run. You can always buy again if something substantial happens.
Lmao why is this funny

As scary as all of that is, ask yourself how any of it will affect how much money Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netflix/Google/Microsoft/Tesla make next quarter. That tells you if/how a piece of news will impact the stock market, everything else is noise as far as the market is concerned.

Didn't know about the 0.13.
HLT and MAR are my preferences if I had to short hotels.  They rely more on business travel and have big international exposure.    Business travel is basically dead and will remain dead due to safety issues and cheapskate corporate budgets. 

That being said HLT seems to have some very high levels of money backing it like Saudi sheikhs who can afford to throw a few hundred million at it.  

But the government (federal) loans all expire on 12/31 and then these hotels will be forced to go draw down their credit lines.

Its like this, lets say it IPO's at 50$.  It climbs on Tech B.S.  great first quarter and predictions, goes to 80$ a share, then we fuck em.  Dump everything and leave.  Totally hose them.  Make their ER so bad it plummets into oblivion. Make it like 30$ a share its so bad.  Tell  anyone who doesn't wanna play along to dump ALL their shares during this ER.  

Then, once it hits like 25 a share, everyone buy up as much as humanly possible, swarm into it and let it soar to Tesla valuation levels.  Its perfect.

Sorry, that's just not true. The total market cap of publicly traded companies has been consistently increasing over time.
Conversion is probably a little wrong, you need to account for the 8:1 multiple vs the ADR then do the currency conversion. Current price i.e
254.2 HKD * 8 * 0.13 (HKD/USD) = 264.368 USD
haha, quality...funny. Basically you repeat 1 of about 10 different one-liners. And if market is up, more bullish comments and the bears are downvoting, if the market is down, more bearish comments and the bulls are downvoting.
Only 3 day trades per week if you have under 25k because it's "too risky"? Holding options overnight is risky af, just let me scalp unlimited times per day and hold cash overnight ffs

No one makes 500% daily u will learn to enjoy 30% gains

So scale it down to ur bank 1000 = 300 pretty fucking nice

Like the previous poster said.. we don't do ethics here. 

As for whether this is good/bad for us as investors... I am long $NIO and this did not make me want to sell. It is just something to consider. So, my assessment in terms of how this affects the picture is that it is a qualified 'good.' I say that, b/c it aligns the interests of NIO with those of the Chinese gov't. Now, the Chinese gov't will protect it's interests when dealing with global EVs such as $TSLA. 

Think of the Chinese gov't like the mafia. NIO is now one of their protected businesses. If names like TSLA want to come in and do business, then China is going to structure things so that their protected businesses will not be harmed, or the harm will be minimal. 

Another way to think about this is that it is in China's interest to form a moat in China around NIO. Having a built-in moat is always good for our investments. However, as with the mafia, if NIO fails to perform for them, there will be consequences, and those consequences will bleed through to investors (pun intended).

The Chinese govt essentially has a lien on NIO's assets, and if they fail to perform, it will be disastrous to us investors. However, I see no reason why NIO would fail to perform.
All true vegans possess this recipe. It involves cashews, seven hours, and witchcraft. And it almost tastes like cheese.

I tried told you but you too busy losing money on NIO
What's the diff?
How I used to think:  "The economy is all screwed up, I should buy puts!"

How I think now:  "The economy is all screwed up.  Algos and shady firms are going to try to pump everything up massively before there's a crash."

The latter seems to work much better, as far as financial worldviews go.
Don't worry about it. Just keep making money. Don't chase what ifs

A lot of the vaccine info in this post is fucked up. Expect news of vaccine submission to FDA for authorization as early as tomorrow (Fri Nov 20), and distribution doses are understated here. MRNA vaccine is 2 doses, not 1, etc.

As in selling?

I noticed that he was focusing on commercial lending. I think it would have been fair to include retail lending, but that still doesn't make him wrong in this point. Commercial lending is a leading indicator for retail lending.

I don't know who's following who or whether I'm looking at the pricing incorrectly or not.

I would argue that leverage is created when debt is created, as debt is paid off leverage+risk is reduced, leaving an asset of value behind?

Primarily low interest rates so borrowing is easy, and my belief that we need to pump money to people to keep small business going. With most (All?) other economies pumping dollars, the US won't want to get a dollar so strong that they cannot sell anything, either.

Either way, I'm just some person on the internet who just doesn't want to hold cash in a savings account.

Deltaone is probably where I saw it too. I was multi-tasking today and that ticker and strike came up. Found time to look at it over lunch. Didn't know about the $120k purchase but it makes sense that there is a whale involved. If there were thousands of people holding a few contracts then it would be because there is a catalyst and it wouldn't be that far OTM. Earnings aren't until January if I'm not mistaken.

I don't know about the other stuff, but MSLP was shit. The vast majority of small businesses don't have an EBITDA because they're not profitable at all yet. If they really wanted to help businesses, they'd have done what the vast majority of lenders do and base what they could fund on revenue. I was surprised they even lent out $25 billion through it. That program showed how out of touch they were at least when it comes to small business.
They tend to feed off each other from what I've been seeing. NYSE seems to have a bigger push though.

If you're making a short term play my #notfinancialadvice recommendations are:

Tesla joins the S&P on Dec 21st. How the market will react, who knows but that's when ETF fund managers must buy in order to track the S&P.

Nikola's IPO lockdown ends Dec 21st. That's when big investors can sell their shares, and given it's widely believed to be a scam it is likely that at least one big investor will hit sell.

Lockdown will end sooner or later in coming months. Oil prices will go back up, and oil companies that are down from Covid will rise again.

I sold my truck and put 25% of the profits into DG cant go tits up Jan 225C May 250C
Damn. Was hoping it was that weird-lie prick
See, you're thinking too hard. You're thinking about available cash and demand and subprime mortgages. Think first principles; can humans afford to buy homes right now? Something every consumer is expected to buy? No? Then fuckery is afoot. The sign that "shit that used to be affordable for consumers is now unimaginably expensive while the rest of the economy isn't totally collapsing" points to it being a bubble. Something similar is happening with college tuition but on a much slower burn.
so if techs up and spys down, does it mean we're rotating back to corona stonks?

Xpev premiums too high. Which other ev makes sense?
I was down 28k (-77%) on my SNAP puts and held for 2 weeks.  Sold for 2k gain.

You need to believe in why you bought the option in the first place.  I believed and also got lucky lol.  I also don't buy any options within a month of expiration in case I need to ride it out.  Don't follow my strategy though... super high risk.  I'm a gambler.

I haven't sword fighted in years
Yeah, they would and when you add transaction costs to execute the contracts it just gets even weirder. I don't see the logic behind it. Only thing I can come up with is a fat finger purchase or someone knows something. Even if the option goes up in price because some whale throws out a 45000 x 0.25 sell order (some brokers list the mean of the bid/ask), nobody is buying unless the underlying gets a lot closer to the strike in a very short period of time.

Whats the expectation for TSLA tomorrow? Any actual insight?
Next time lose the money the Wsb way instead of heroin.
I read it, but I think you're off on a few things. First, I don't prescribe to much of what Warren Buffet says because his style of investing worked great for the last industrial revolution but doesn't exactly work for growth investing which has dominated since Web 2.0, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the new interest rate regime, and honestly into the foreseeable future.

Second, the SPY spent Sept-Oct consolidating and put in a double bottom before starting a breakout. If you pull back the chart to weeklies it's very clearly breaking out. Your chart is pretty zoomed, and I think you might be reading too much into the 1% difference between the first and second rejection annotation, especially given the circumstances of the time. I'd say the real takeaway should be the double bottom around \~$320 for SPY.

Quantitative easing being deflationary shouldn't be as big of a deal as it would have been 40 years ago. The largest sectors and market leaders are Tech, and frankly, the rest of the market can go to crap but as long as Tech retains leadership you can still make money from those groups. As a SPY investor, you might not see big gains from the overall market, but that doesn't necessarily mean a major selloff is looming.

Also, I'd point out that cap rates have been extremely low in commercial real estate in the major markets for the past 5 years or so, but I wouldn't say that suddenly the lack of lending to new office or MFH projects is a bearish indicator.

Overall, a lot of this reminded me of the bearish sentiment from old value guys when we emerged from the financial crisis (and they basically struggled for years). The new trend is pretty solidly in place, and while it might be choppy, I wouldn't fight it too hard. Personally, I'm pretty positive that we'll get another grind higher once Nov 20s expiration is behind us followed by the potential for a classic Feb selloff.

i'm mostly a PC guy, but PS5 has Demon Souls which is really just a remaster but looks pretty good imo and fun, they did a great job. it also has Spiderman remaster but you have to buy the inferior Miles Morales game.  Xbox has Gamer Pass which has a shit ton of cool games to play so that's awesome.  overall I'd go PC and PS5. but In the end no. I don't think either console has new games worth getting. it's only worth getting a console right now cuz they hard to get. I got the PS5 simply because it was fun trying to get it.

Yes it works on a daily but then you don't see any trends because it's too zoomed in; I use the 3-month view to get better perspective.  Got out of daily views when I switched to this model.
Even if you miss the first 3% drop, you will catch the next 12% and fuck with that for certain. Turn them gains around and buy a big fat dip.

SPY, you may be all growed up now but I still remember who you are and where you came from. Back when you were only 180 years old you took that job out in Cali and you were never the same. You know I feel about it, but I'll say it again, I don't think you should be working for the Fed. It's *okay* if you're üåàgay! You're obviously over-compensating for something, I just want you to be happy, and be true to who really are.

Mom and me love you,

I love FUV and have been long since March on them.  (When I started). I think their last mile delivery and rapid responder will be popular.   Not sure about the Orlando thing but there‚Äôs a lot of potential and ev seems to fit short run vehicle needs.

Ive been seeing a lot of Op-Ed‚Äôs on why the shift away from tech is happening, being accelerated by the vaccine, and I think they‚Äôre absolutely wrong. The vaccine is still going to take a LONG time to be distributed and not everyone will get it. COVID is here to stay.....and so is Netflix.

No, those are chemicals, not fun. That's the high you're chasing. Anyway, still diamond handing these SQ 3/19 210C and there's still time for you to get in, retard.

Svetlana (Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian Cyrillic: –°–≤–µ—Ç–ª–∞–Ω–∞; Belarusian: –°–≤—è—Ç–ª–∞–Ω–∞, romanized: Sviatlana; Ukrainian: –°–≤—ñ—Ç–ª–∞–Ω–∞, romanized: Svitlana) is a common Orthodox Slavic female name, deriving from the East and South Slavic root svet (Cyrillic: —Å–≤–µ—Ç), which translates into English as "light", "shining", "luminescent", "pure", "blessed", or "holy", depending upon context similar if not the same as the word Shweta in Sanskrit. The name was coined by Alexander Vostokov and popularized by Vasily Zhukovsky in his eponymous ballad "Svetlana", first published in 1813.

Random fact, all money is a form of debt.   So having more debt is literally having more money supply when you are the government.   But having more debt as a person is being broke.  The cards are stacked man.  Might as well YOLO student loan money if you are broke.  If you actually have any money though don't expect a bailout, those are only for bankers and retards.

They are all eating out all the time supporting local chow spots... That's not an inflation thing, it's a real thing that happened.

Depending on where FCEL opens tomorrow, I'm going to be watching closely. Looks like it was up 5.1% during the day and down 3.17% AH. Hoping it rolls a little further downhill and then  buy some March calls ATM for a quick bounce up next week and sell at +40-60% Gain

Easy
Yea I work for mgm resorts in Vegas. Occupancy rates on the weekends are 50-60%, but during the week we're at 17-25%. Its going to be a really rough quarter. This is generally our slow season, but we get through it with a handful of good conventions in October and November, then rodeo in December. The week between Christmas and New Years is generally our biggest week to recover from the slow period, bolstered by tourists coming mainly from Europe and Asia. All those conventions are gone, New Years Eve celebration is cancelled, and I don't see us having that travel into the states from countries that are also locked down. 

We always look forward to January and February, as those are traditionally our biggest months bolstered by some massive conventions, including CES, but those are gone too. March is usually great due to a few conventions+ March madness.

So really, our turnaround might happen in March if March madness isn't completely canceled, and we start to see vaccine distribution in late spring, though I think it will be mid summer at the earliest.

The one thing that MGM does have going for it, it went with an "asset lite" strategy over the last few years, selling the physical land and buildings that the hotels and casinos to a reit, while retaining operations of the casinos. So the MGM has a TON of cash on hand to ride out the storm. Even so, I've been perplexed by the recent upswing in ticker price. 

Just my two cents.
Never heard about gsx

Sounds epic though
I‚Äôm trying to figure out why he‚Äôs gotta label which mom it is
I already did fool
Or a pump and dump, hey everyone buy my bags!
Is it Chasdaq or Chadsdaq?
The best feeling in the world is selling a put to a random sucker after 3 days of red (or selling a call after a multiple +5% days) and seeing the stock price reverse and decimate the option value.
All I need it to do is graze $50 at some point
This shit is going back to $5 where it belongs
He's caught up in his feelings and can no longer pump. The best you can hope for is that he may lash out at some companies and cause a trump dump.
Why not fuv instead, went up more than solo 69%
R2000 might get burned.
Make sure the interest rate is more than 20% otherwise what's the point

I have never even considered excercising my options but then again I‚Äôm broke anyway
It took a full month and a half after lockdowns started for the peak to happen in the spring. We were under 1000 deaths per day when the lockdown started. We're already at 1900 daily this time and almost nowhere has closed anything, with lots of places promising to not close no matter what.

Solo has been mooning. PLTR has some solid momentum as well. MCD, BABA, NIO and COTY aren\`t seeing the same momentum. If you're shorter-term, you're better off with something like the former.
and how best to fuck every one of you, specifically
Is this real?

Wouldn‚Äôt you want to do it on November 30th?
How so?  Sounds like the mango man is trying to get states to send loyal (or faithless) electors.  See 12th amendment.  I don‚Äôt see a concession at all.
So, RIOT had a pretty good day. Anyone else deep into it?

Edit: I've got money into it rather than shitcoin as I psychologically can't bring myself to buy them directly.
Playing SPY is expensive. SPXS for us poor autists?
its aight but i miss the steak and ale pies from England. I lived there for a few years and that shit was dope.
They are fucked if they do and fucked if they don't. Algorithmically promote baseless conspiracy theories, radicalize people, then eventually be blamed for damaging democracy. Attempt to validate facts and get accused of censorship.
Actually it was ~$120K my bad but yeah still lol. 39,600 contracts at $.03
GME is already on sale.
What are the chances...
2 months. Christmas season. Stock seems to have taken a beating already should recover and break ATH
Should I apply for futures trading so I can lose money 24/6?

Every other strike has much lower volume. AMD needs an 8.1% jump tomorrow just to be ITM. So either someone knows something or there is fuckery afoot.
Nah not true. Since March NDX has outperformed SpX by appx 15%. And over the last 3 years its beaten the SPX by 50% .

It's a very popular spread trade and a way to hedge market risk (assuming you're on the right side of the spread)

Brilliant answer.   Not really right, but A for effort.

Palantir knows which one of us bought at what price.
honest question, why buy 36 320p for $1 when you coulda bought like 18 335p for $2 (it was roughly 335 when I looked at like 2pm)
It's probably ohio, I follow a guy who buys properties like that in ohio all the time.  Where I live it's similar to what you have and I think dang that sucks but the. I look at my equity.

Cashed out Tuesday morning but bought back in today at end of day for 12/18.  550c.  
I think the index rebalancing happens second Friday of the month after market so maybe it‚Äôs priced in but either way I think they can hit 10% after inclusion.
Right before Christmas? During lockdown?!
"It's friday, triple witchening is today"
Oh nice. Any plays you‚Äôll be making?

It will gap up tomorrow and wait for a big volume dump, buy puts on the rebound. One of the big wigs will get scared and dump early.

Yeah no. In the early days Ant group actually got a lot of preferential treatment from the Chinese central bank.

They like it's payments system very much. They are just concerned with it's CreditTech group (which also happens to be the most profitable part of Ant...) because it's asset backed lending schemes with low % collateral scream of the sort of sub-prime lending shit that blew up in 2008.

After reigning that in Ant valuation will drop some, probably a lot actually but it will IPO just fine and likely moon shortly after.

300 @ 10.03
I normally laugh at dumb bears who get excited with less than 1% drop in FUTURES but I often feel pity for them cuz I cant imagine how desperate one needs to be to get that excited for nothing :(
So I learned all this shit and studied only to realize memes move the market and if you ignore that you will underperform. 

I have performed well this year, but this thought is depressing me and I am thinking of just becoming a cabinet maker.  Hahah these are my true feelings and I can‚Äôt tell my wife this...
Not really

1. They were profitable Q3 during the worst travel year ever

2. They‚Äôre at 80% of last year bookings right now versus 40% for major hotel chains. So they are more resilient, will have less debt and depressed assets by a huge amount, and they cut their advertising by hundreds of millions on top of it. In other words, they‚Äôve demonstrated a moat against traditional hotels.

3. The new trend is towards booking a larger Airbnb for a week or a month to work from home or vacation away from the city. This has raised the average Airbnb price to over $100 while the average hotel rate is down to around $50

4. Tons of capital on the sidelines looking for new growth stocks to invest in with Apple at ~$2,000 billion valuation there is a lot more upside investing in a housing related company with a multi trillion dollar target market that‚Äôs valued at $30-40 billion

5. New Years and the holidays will have tons of bookings so first quarter numbers will be an easy beat
hot take: we already saw it in the spring
We seen this before with the China trade talks. Shit gets bad then it recovers as everyone thinks it‚Äôs overblown then ü•≠ comes out and takes a big steamy shit on your calls then everyone thinks alright now it‚Äôs over and then it gets worse and worse.

The keg is at 66% of its former value. More over the keg.un is a royalty fund that takes a 4% cut of top line revenues. So it's really just a bet that the keg stays in business and continues to serve customers. 

The fund itself is a bit shit because it has very little growth beyond....a potential 10% dividend going forward..but we won't get into that......

But uhhh yea it's got 30% left to run son....also Canada has rent subsidies and wage subsidies in place until June with kickers on top of ya province is shut down..
Right?!? But if you are like me you will think about how shitty you will feel if you miss the drop that was obviously coming so you go right back to buying puts on six flags like a miserable gay bear

Lol, at least shares of UVXY don't expire worthless. I don't know how you can have enough appetite for risk to buy VXX calls, but not UVXY. In any rate, the trick is all about timing.

Holy shit! That's a hell of a combination of autism and balls. If I had $200k to drop on options I honestly don't know if I could have pulled the trigger on that trade.

I'm not defending anti-maskers. There is no defense for it. But I'm tired of Midwesterners being labeled idiots by coastal folks who overall fared worse with the disease. Some of that was those states getting hit earlier, but in Ohio DeWine was closing things faster than Cuomo despite having almost no cases. We were told to act responsibily by locking down and most people did. At that time we were sending supplies and workers to New York while they had cases and we really didn't. Now that the reverse happens (although New York now also has thousands of cases daily) some New Yorkers want to shit on the people here as if our ignorance is causing it. It's flaring back up all across the western world.

This pandemic is crushing small business owners financially and kids academically and socially. I think it's fair for people to be tired of the restrictions (not talking mask mandates or restrictions on large gatherings) causing that without being accused of wanting to kill people or being uneducated.

Everyone here is predicting some legendary crash tomorrow, yet futures have been pretty much flat for 3 hours now

it dont add up to me boys
what's wrong with that?
Id be fine with that tbh
That's true, but only reason I took away the 0 is because everyone here kept crying that they haven't posted profits in years, and then I instead invested it into PSTH. I had the best entry point too a month ago when it was still below 10. Congrats on the gains man.
No it's the perfect way to panic trade though

\- President refuses to concede election and seems hellbent on burning this mfer down as his term ends  
\- Cancellation of corona relief loans.  
\- Schools closing all over the state which means parents can't go to work if they have young kids

I bought 250 shares this morning at $18.19. Kinda like when I bought NIO at $21, I thought "damn, I wish I would have got in at $4".  But I saw it going into mid-high double digits by the end of the year, if I'm right I double $ or more. If you think PLTR is going to 40 or 50 or whatever, why fret about what you could have done earlier? You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

He can't force the change he wants as an activist investor either. He's further from that ability actually because now he doesn't get all the strategic info and insider points; he will get what they choose to give him and like all humans he can be manipulated.

Another electric bus maker, $GPV, has been running up lately. They're delivering about 20 buses per month. Meanwhile, in 2016, Microvast delivered 7500 buses, so average 625 per month. They sell globally, operating in China, the US and Europe. By the way, that 7500 buses is before they even entered the U.S market, which they did in 2017. Think about that for a second. The minute we see some financial disclosures showing thousands of bus sales over the last three years to American cities, this stock will take off. Plus it's chinese which means you know they will be cooking books like a mother fucker. This is actually a good buy. No options available and I don't know wtf warrants are so I'm gonna buy shares. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

ToS dashboard can be customized however you want. Keep your screen as clean as possible so you don't overload yourself with squiggly lines at first.

I'd start with a simple watchlist, chart, order flow, and an option chain window if that's what you're into.
It's all on the profits. If you're really fucking good at options, you can absolutely outperform buy and hold. I do a mix of both, but at the end of the day I sell for profit.

If I have something up 30% and I think it might go up to 35% if I wait 12 months, I sell and re-invest those gains into something else I think will go up 30% and take the short terms gain hit. My 401K can take the tax advantage

Your taking out a loan for the home. You can sell it for a profit whenever as long as it covers the cost of the loan. 

Idk. I've always felt renting was a good way to give away money, and I don't know your situation, or plan so this may not apply to you but if you have the means to buy a home maybe or could in time the maybe don't give away your money. It looks better making you more money.

All the things you mentioned that you may feel are lacking in life give you a benefit of having more time in the day to be productive. Not to suggest being unproductive is inherently bad, but if you are looking to improve in other areas of life, time is your greatest asset. 
Whether it's a hobby, learning a new skill, starting a business (even if it's only for tax benefits), time is something that is traded for friends, girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife, kids, etc.

Think about it, they're trading at 1/3 - 1/4 of Amazon on nearly all valuation metrics.

They lost around 60b in market cap on the day of the Ant Group snub. Few days later, they generated 73b in sales from Single's day. 

And all Jack needs to do for BABA to regain that 60b market is to suck emperor xi's pp. That's the easiest job in the world for 60b.
I know but I can't help getting older and seeing all my cousins and friends settling down and a voice in the back of my head saying that I want that.
So no stimulus thats why we gonna have circuit breaker
I sold my 12/4's that had been up 300% for 10% profit and bought some weeklies instead, since I wasn't waiting on some catalyst that was coming up anymore and just on a bounce back. Sold half at 100% and got the last ones riding into tomorrow
These two weeks are probably the best for GME. 

Currently holding a bunch of 15c 1/15 and 500 shares. 

Should I use the rest of my buying power + margin and buy few thousand shares?
Why would it move up before the merger?

I live in one of the states you listed, in an area that has been largely unaffected by the virus other than small business owners getting fucked.

I don't agree with full on lockdowns. Essential shit needs happen and if manufacturing/retail for non-essentials can be done safely, then I'm all for it.

My gripe comes with the anti-mask morons that still believe this thing is a 100% hoax. They don't consider the economic impact of sick healthcare workers at a time when hospital beds are filling up.

Things aren't going back to normal until we get a hold of the virus. Doesn't matter if 50% of the country could give a shit, it's still gonna affect them in one way or another.

Might as well get it over with instead of protesting the right to fresh air in the Walmart aisle.

Take it from a guy who‚Äôs won big and lost big.. try to be a little less greedy bruv. 

You can only blow up your portfolio so many times before you throw in the towel. There‚Äôs way too much money to make to be thinking that you have to make it all back on the next trade.

once it breaks 10 i think itll be picked up by more institutions and we'll see it rally from that news. vaccine news keeps pushing it along, that variable has me concerned though with how sour it could be if we hear that the vaccines are being pushed back or etc. i think a lot of boomers that have GE in their portfolio would have already sold with the past month increase of like 30%.
A lot of raunchy penis memes and gay slurs back in the day, e.g. - "phaget".
About 25%, and hopefully big tomorrow

It wasnt easy to find and the market isnt over priced in that area. Guy was asking 65k but got him down to 30. I personally wouldnt live there by choice now just based on the area. Saying that, i grew up poor, even lived in a trailer park, so i dont mind being a bit picky when i can. It was a 1300 sq/ft 3bd 1bf SFH built in the 60s. Needed new roof, windows, paint inside and out, carpet, gutters and flashing, some interesting electrical issues and a few other minor things. I think i couldve got 90-95k out of it but it was the beginning of the pandemic and i was unsure of where the market was going to go. I still made a nice profit that id take and day of the week

>I'm not gonna ask her, but if I had to imagine what she'd say, it would be "There's about to be another housing bubble, invest in something that isn't tied to real estate."

Would you mind confirming with her that info and why?  I would truly appreciate it.
Have you learned your lesson?
Us was up like 1% with after market. 

In hk it's 2.7%
Sure. 

It's bad. Low rates are a product of an unhealthy economy. In a strong economy you have higher rates which helps reduce overspending or lending. 

Since the 1970's America lost its collective mind. Everyone thought they were going to be billionaires. So the typical safeguards that were in place (social and economic) went by the wayside as people tasted some of the good life. Of course alot of this was through borrowing (see national debt as a percent of gdp).

Fast forward and you started to see insane behavior. People with $60k jobs buying $500k homes because that kind of economic activity benefited the rich (they took their fees and sold to the poor) while they slowly started decimating the job force (first blue collar jobs and then slowly good paying jobs).

2009 happened when the first wave collapsed. Bottom line was people couldn't pay back what they owed because I ye continual need to lend and spend was imbalance by labor still taking too much of the pie. The 2009 recession destroyed housing partly in places like florida and arizona because the jobs that supported it didn't need to exist anymore and with a better educated population there was too many people for what little labor demand remained. That fueled the gig stuff and generally speaking alot people never came back

Instead of responsible monetary policy the fed kept rates low and policymakers flooded the system with cash, there was less overhead and regs and no rate hikes for a while. People overborrowed again even through the same problems of 2009 were never addressed. Add in a unhealthy and aging population and things were getting worse.

But still loans were handed out like candy even thought no one needs 8393939 dynamic seasoned professionals.

Things were still stable in part because there wasn't a shock to the system and the fed cut rates last year.

Then corona hit and the entire system fell apart. And it fell apart in a week because it relies purely on present credit and labor. Both got taken away quick

Then congress decided to flood the system with cash and the fed decided to reduce rates to zero, backstop MBS etc.

People saw that and took advantage of cheap credit.

See the problem?
An interesting factor in the PM Mining Space is that Gold and Silver discoveries are way down.  The time necessary to permit a new mine is also way up - and getting exponentially more difficult.  These factors bode well for the Supply conundrum.  Additionally, ETF buying is now putting supply balance in to negative territory.  Hopefully, my prediction holds true but I only need Silver at $50 to make a few million.
Vaccine eua in 2 weeks will do it. Flat until then.
This COVID shit sucks. I was somewhat of a social butterfly up until like February, and now I feel kinda similar to you. A lot of people's personalities changed over the last 9 months, like people who had been cheerful and social for the last 10 years now are completely different people.

Collectively, nobody has anything to look forward to so people are deciding to settle down. I usually only keep open-minded people in my social circle, and somehow all the people I've surrounded myself during the last couple years don't even see past the tip of their noses anymore.

I am confused. So let's say the stock price is down by 5% tomorrow, then his options are ITM. So that leaves him with two options. Either sell them or exercise them. I don't think he is rich enough to exercise them. So, that leaves him with selling the options. So, what if his bid price is less than the ask price, then there is a possibility he will manage to sell all of them by making decent profits. What am I missing here ?

Bubbles gonna bubble, the narrative doesn't matter, anyone who debates that this is a bubble is too young to have seen one or delusional.

I still stand by my reasoning that it was the 20% uh oh that changed his mind. It wasn‚Äôt until Christmas Eve that they signaled a willingness to halt rate hikes and we reversed that day and then that led to the whole ‚Äúmid cycle adjustment‚Äù.

Your summer job? Are you even old enough to trade? 3 months at minimum wage is like $3.7k. I promise you losing $3.7k is not the worst decision of your life. That's less than I paid to help my GF out with her car crash that someone else caused.

I'm down $40k YTD, but my options acct low was $250 in august and I'm back to $8k without reloading. If you learn and stick around you might learn some good shit. 

Otherwise take this as a lesson about the value of wage cuckery and study for something that pays big baller dollars since it sounds like you're in school. Yes you can do the hard majors. I was a history major and got a 3.8GPA in my CompSci master's degree.

I don't think you understand how much money there is going to corporations. They're getting TRILLIONS to boost the stock market and keep companies from going out of business. Which is just ridiculous, companies that cant afford to stay afloat should go out of business. Just like what's happening to middle class Americans. The poor are benefiting, the rich are benefiting and the middle class is getting fucked. 

America could give EVERY American $2000 a month for the next 3 years and we'll spend less than we spent the last 6 months to keep corporations afloat. Let that sink in.

The fact is, you don't know what kind of power dynamics were happening behind the scenes. You don't know how it affects Powell's decision making when he sees headlines about the president wanting to fire him for not doing his will.

For example, if the president were instead saying "steel the course, don't mind the markets," we may not have seen rate cuts in 2019.

I completely get why you‚Äôd like their product. I‚Äôd like their product. Doesn‚Äôt mean what I want is what a tiny fraction of a majority would want or would afford.
Wish I had the answer to that!  There is a lot of speculation that the earnings will be very good and send the price higher, but who knows how the market will react.  Maybe buy  some tomorrow and again if there is a dip after earnings?  We had a 6% drop yesterday and I bought more before the huge run today, so just be patient and pick your spots. Good luck!

You‚Äôre right. 15k on 45c tomorrow at open.
I hope so. I‚Äôm hoping for an ANT revival announcement.
Jesus, 2k square foot absolute shitholes in my area (Minneapolis suburbs) would still cost well north of $150k... And those would literally be unlivable (unless it was a condo I guess?)

Yeah I got shares and January's left. BABA not being able to go up, what was it, 2-3% to satisfy my weeklies was a big shocker. RIP $3000. Keep the target reasonable and at least a month away and calls seem very doable.

Nah this is fallacious. Other countries are literally giving their populous 2k a month per person. We're actually going to be far ahead because many countries are functionally bankrupt now. Several countries are legit out of money because they exclusively rely on the usa to be not locked down. People forget every other country has the same problem as the usa. In fact since a lot of us don't really give a shit about the pandemic we're unintentionally causing herd immunity allowing us to open faster. Europe, asia, africa and middle east are now going through what we went through a few months ago. Many people predicted this including myself. For example, canada has gained more debt in 1 year than the entire time of it's existence. Their money might as well be monopoly money.

And you can't really fuck with mortgages. Absent a massive stimulus and forbearance forever low rates isn't going to help.

Someone has to pay the principal + insurance + taxes. And guess what? local governments are full of well paid workers. They aren't going to take pay cuts and their union contracts plus local debt needs to be paid. So taxes go up. And no one is spending money which would flow through to them.

So expect property tax defaults which means lenders will step and put the mortgage in default and suddenly there isn't any money flowing back.


Cutting rates to zero was the same as pouring gas on the economic fire.

I'm as bullish as a person typically gets, but the Mnuchin news will definitely spook the markets a bit. And Trump probably isn't going to issue any pumps to calm things like he would have in the past, so once it gets going, it might keep going.

How far does this go?

Is it like saying retard too much (guilty), or literally bringing up "tendies, FDs, gay bears" multiple times in normal conversation?
Lol this is great and you went balls deep into your position, bravo.

I just wanna add that the market seems like it's simultaneously forward-looking but also overreacts to things in the short term. It kinda fucks with my head, but I agree that things appear to be a tad too bullish about our recovery prospects. This already happened once back in June, when the initial outbreak started to decline. Medical experts already anticipated worsening conditions in the Fall/Winter, but it didn't matter until it did.

I suspect Covid has already mutated into different strains at this point and I wouldn't be surprised if the vaccines end up being about as effective as the flu shot is, which could dump its efficiency down into the 40-60% range.

Does SQ moon on "we gonna all die from Covid" days like ZM?
Yeah, I tried that too. But the penalty for the year was almost 10% which was a huge gut punch after federal and state is included. You‚Äôll be looking at close to 45% of gains depending on how much you make in your normal job. Maybe the math works out, but I find the smaller quarterly checks are easier to write lol.
Expedia had Barry Diller step in and sack management before Covid hit.  Their expenses were out of control and as a company they just weren't focused or executing.  They will come out of this much leaner, more focused, and more importantly, more profitable with leaner overhead.  Weird as it is, it probably is worth more now than it was in February.
Um, hm, I guess that would make too much sense.  I might consider trying to rinse and repeat in the a.m.
Short means sell . For example, short put would mean selling a put. They are different

Well I am cancelling my sell orders on BABA lol. Was hoping to get a quick one day score of a few points but it looks like it might blast off
I dont touch levered indices.
Tesla is ranked 12th, BRK.A ranked 11th. Once it surpasses BRK.A, BABA is next to crack top 10.
word. I have been playing weekly and occasionally  monthly short puts, all cash covered. 

If you're looking for a good company to write puts on at the moment, take a look at TREE. Rated highly by analysts at Merrill / CFRA, who have been very accurate thus far during the pandemic bull run. 

I wrote 12/18 240p this afternoon after they'd fallen another 5%. For no particular reason, I do think TREE will reach 240 around Dec 31.

I generally like the play.  I had LVS shares and calls but got out a bit too early when it crossed $52.  Because it's changing its focus to Singapore and Macau and trying to sell Vegas I don't want to buy puts for the slight dip it will likely take on the inevitable pullback, but MGM remains a stretched company that was just starting to re-org when Covid hit.  Horrible, horrible timing for them.

A couple of things to consider:  There will likely be a stimulus pop.  Maybe more than one.  The Presidential contest becomes less important by the day and members of Congress know that they're all being blamed for inaction.  Believe it or not, they're sensitive to that.  Both parties.

BUT, I think you're missing a bigger downside catalyst:  Conventions.   Vegas makes its money on convention traffic.  The holidays you mention that they're going to lose are gravy.  They're going to be missing the main course for almost another year.

Conventions have long lead times for planning/logistics of all involved.  Most of the big ones have cancelled into next summer.  Even if everyone is vaccinated by April, I doubt you really see conventions come back full force for over a year.  Zoom will replace a lot of this corporate expense.

I'll start watching for an entry point for puts (and for my comfort level, a little longer time horizon).  Good write up.   Best of luck, and thanks.

You are fully showing the extreme.

As with the price rising, funds that own Tesla now will go above their holding %, like ARK did recently and will have to sell some. This will create more of a float that isn't being accounted for. It's not like everyone will hold, but we will most likely have a big spike(s) at points for seconds to minutes I feel like.
Sadly I was too much of a pussy to pull the trigger on Tesla.
Saw it at 435, dropping towards 430, and I thought, ''If it hits 430, I'll go in for a few shares''.

*Spoiler alert, it never reached close to 430.
Not everyone can have a big pp like us
Just the beginning

Decide your exit before buying, whether that‚Äôs 20%, 50% or 300%. Have a plan and don‚Äôt be afraid to take a small loss because that money would be best used on another contract.

I'll probably get 1.5+ mil when my parents die if they died today. But I actually would rather get rich(er) on my own with them alive. They are 73 (dad) and 72 (mom) and are both in excellent health and could last another 20 years. And I hate that most of my money is because they set me up for it. It's not about being ABLE to retire at a normal age like 65. It's about not spending another GD moment in my retarded job that pays me too much (undeservedly) to be horribly pedantic. So I can spend my time hunting for fossils,  meteorites, gold, sailing, and on my ultimate goal of finding an exoplanet.

I don't think that a person's financial situation should be used to judge if they deserve success or not. This applies to both rich and poor. Now, the fact that a certain person who happens to be a billionaire creates solutions that improve people's lives is something that deserves encouragement. However remember that Musk only got there due to all the lucky strikes he had during his life. In reality many people who are as or more smart and have as good or even better ideas than he does never get the chance of seeing them being executed due to their lack of lucky.
I wouldn't be upset if I hold it medium-long. The "quick" in my thinking was that, ideally, what I perceive as a really strong sell-off will recover quickly.

According to investopedia: "The Fed can indeed create money "out of thin air." To be more precise, it does so with keystrokes on a computer. This was illustrated with its QE program, also known as open market operations. That's when the Fed buys an asset from a financial institution and pays for it with money it simply creates.

Steve Meyer, a senior advisor to the Fed's Board of Governors,¬†explains how this is done. ‚ÄúYou may wonder how the Fed pays for the bonds and other securities it buys," he says. "The Fed does not pay with paper money. Instead, the Fed pays the seller‚Äôs bank using newly created electronic funds and the bank adds those funds to the seller‚Äôs account.‚Äù"

First of all importance of Stop Loss and to pull out for volatile events like election.I also learned [how to trade options.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms&list=WL&index=1)  Watching the technical analysis updates for both bull run and bear run, I learned both side of technical analysis. I now have better understanding of resistance, supports, earnings, biotech news.
Go to small street bets
which ones exactly
You can‚Äôt tell me that the bear post on the front page is not a blatant lie to get people to buy his shitty puts, look at his past DD. He says we are crashing hard 20 days ago and we all know what happened through the election: HULK COCKS. These big bear bois come and go and get thousands of bloodthirsty followers and more often than not get completely cucked. Look at the fall of the great Variation Separate and all the tards who thought SPY was going to 200 in April.
my big risk is IBIO...invested $30k...and only down - $15k...but it will come up..I hope

Probably not, unless volume increases. I've had mine for a month and there have been plenty of catalyst events, but it just drops back. Very unfortunate

It would easily be in the 90s-100s if it wasn't for the merger weighing it down!
I think that is probably a poor strategy. BABA isn't likely to moon quickly. It will be a slow grind back up. A completely legit long term move but for short term plays there are better on offer.

I would do options but shitty marketwatch doesn‚Äôt have them

Noobs and people who are happy to slowly make double digit returns, with no risk of ever going to zero.
You're very certain. Are you playing this through spreads or pure puts?
Just a thought, what if they aren't actually printing any money? Like what if they're just telling us they are and putting down that they are? How would we know if they control anything? Have they ever printed anything during this pandemic at all? Wouldn't telling us but doing nothing have the same effect?
I don‚Äôt judge - he wanted to buy those options and I‚Äôd rather be paid to be margin-hedged, I say dammit that‚Äôs a good deal for both of us.

There are hundreds of articles about it. When he names Lael Brainard or Janet Yellen you can pretend to be surprised. It obviously won‚Äôt be Warren since they would lose the Senate seat.

‚ÄúStock‚Äù as in shares?? Yeah we don‚Äôt do that around here
The shitty thing for bears is that we're getting pretty desensitized to bad news here. Some global shutdowns and bad stimulus news knock us down a peg, but it's just bought back up within the week. This market wants its blow off top

Obviously you‚Äôll beat it, but it‚Äôs a significant percentage and it gains interest every month. Either way, congrats.

Yeah he's a smart guy. I think it's harder to guess shorts in this market. Shorted ACB, lost. SIX, NHCL, CCL pending but mostly down 80% with 12/18 exp and I bought near highs.

At some point you just need to cut losses, or stop betting in that direction.

PELLEY: Fair to say you simply flooded the system with money?
POWELL: Yes. We did. That's another way to think about it. We did.
PELLEY: Where does it come from? Do you just print it?
POWELL: We print it digitally. So as a central bank, we have the ability to create money digitally. And we do that by buying Treasury Bills or bonds for other government guaranteed securities. And that actually increases the money supply. We also print actual currency and we distribute that through the Federal Reserve banks.

Your Tesla call expires in 7 days, your NIO call expires in a few weeks.  I think Tesla is going to keep climbing with new valuations and eventually drop a bit to find it‚Äôs spot, that said I wouldn‚Äôt sell unless it hits 550 or wait until mid day spike the day before expiration.  Nio will keep pushing you have a lot of time, hold it.

Yep, tech lookin all good
Of course I don't but I also don't want to miss the rise in the mean time.  If I go up 20% before the correction i would be effectively flat.

May be time to tone down big call bets and shorter the horizon.

Maybe stoplosses at like 7.5% on stable stocks like Amzn, Aapl etc and actively sell if the whole market goes red.

Damn hard to time puts on tech and dangerous as they could run for a while.

VIX /VXX may work, but it could be a slow bleed and not a rapid crash which wouldn't increase the volatility and make those bets not pay off.
I personally would not be stressed if I had that call. Tesla is on a moon mission from now till s&p induction

Transfer from the inpatient to the patient... what a dumbass
If they ever show up on stage. Maybe they're using this time to talk over past issues they want to move on from.
look at the 1 day SPY chart

we are in a downtrend, at the very least a temporary one

you can't predict events that easily but it's not hard to look at RSI on a 1 day chart and see it's overbought and the same thing happened the past 2 months, just different news

question is whether it continues or rebounds, down immediate term is a near certainty
I thought I saw the 13f for renaissance last week. Figured that‚Äôs when it would‚Äôve moved.

The people who buy expensive cars like Tesla are not affected by all the stuff you listed. 

It‚Äôs a buyer‚Äôs market now for half of the country. Housings is up. The buyers don‚Äôt need no stinking sim or public transportation :) government services are for poor people.
I couldn‚Äôt be more long on NVDA. Crazy cause I‚Äôm young and I missed the good times already most would say but I love their future with AI
And yes NIO will 52 by then. It‚Äôll hit next week
You're right, but im so deep ITM that it won't matter. And if so, I'm confident it'll rally so I'd just buy more calls.
Dude 90% of these fucks are watching futures on investing.com

Nice!  CIIC was a good pick
Friday‚Äôs are bad sometimes yes, but today was bullish af. We broke out from a range we‚Äôve been in for 3 weeks. Also, huge buying today, also in AH. Someone is trying to get in fast. Tomorrow should be great
Shit actually i stand coreected it did pretty well Oct 23rd. Maybe we gonna print tm i have hella worthless 15c or something expiring tm
It's bullish bro - more deaths = more stimulus to people alive - like dividing a 6 slice cake to 5 people instead of 6 - everyone gets more.
I technically have a job, I get paid and shit but haven't left my house or even did remote work since March...so yea, I guess day trading is my job.

From what I understand (and I‚Äôm just another idiot on WSB) tickers that have options that trade on 5¬¢ increments can execute at odd prices but only as a part of a spread or if the broker allows market price options trades. So that 209 ask volume you see is probably not all asking 0.05, there are likely a lot that are asking 0.01 or 0.02, and those will get filled before yours, because RH doesn‚Äôt allow market option trades.
We should probably work on your insults.

There are three main types of investors here, in order of popularity:

Momentum: These are the investors who simply ride trends very, very hard through surprisingly low stakes betting. What happens is they bet far OTM (1SD+) (cheaper) and longer-dated (safer) options calling them YOLO when in fact they are simply setting up trades that actually tend to be profitable.

Contrarian: These are the investors who see value somewhere and put their money there then publicly post about it. Not to be mistaken for actual value investors these individuals usually have the spotlight when they are correct and almost surely fade into obscurity when they are wrong. You don't get many of these this year but perhaps back in 2018 you had a lot more of this type of behavior where someone would give an excellent explanation of why they were doing what they were doing and in some cases it was brilliant and in others it was not.

High-Stakes: These are investors who buy calls and puts that are very short DTE, very directional, and almost always backed by "a gut feeling" or historical performance. 90% of the time it ends horrifically. Despite being the least popular overall this year this is most of the individuals here; lots of people who never have done this before show up, buy weeklies (or two weeks because they are "safe"), and tend to pay almost no attention to things like IV, couldn't tell you any Greeks other than "Delta" and "Theta" and rarely if ever can explain anything about them accurately. They are either mostly asking others what to do or have no idea how to even do basic diligence and understand what a company does.

So despite the place being filled with "retards" a lot of smart people used to hang out here until the High-Stakes crew took over. They will likely hang out for two or more years in cycles because that's how long these weird market aberrations tend to last, and then you'll get back to the top two.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Basically this is a "board" for momentum investors.

I think this flu season will be pretty mild. There will be more people wearing masks (though masks may not make much of a difference in flu transmission) than ever before and all the talk of vaccines might encourage more people to get a flu shot. Plus, there are expected to be more school/office closures. 

We shall see, though. I am certain that COVID is going to be real shitty for the next couple of months at least.

I can‚Äôt find that anywhere, I‚Äôve been holding them for months. I have 100 shares or so and I‚Äôm down $60 but I have a lot of faith in the company. The concept is awesome, check out their website. They offer a membership that‚Äôs month to month for their cars, it comes with insurance and maintenance. They haven‚Äôt announced the price but it is going to be less than $900 a month.
Fucking right. I have 4 and can‚Äôt ever hear them
That's the spirit of wsb.
Think I may do $16.5P 12/11. Cost basis isn't too far off and if I can catch the bottom tomorrow after we test $19 again at open I might get some juicy premium on that.

Pltr up 6% today yet my calls were up 0% 

Time to find the next one boys and girls

Made 15k earlier this month and need to let it be.

Get in with shares
May I encourage a call spread reaching down somewhat lower as well to mitigate the risk of losing it all in less than 2 months.
how would you guys feel about some KSS putos. Wild run on reopening hopes and sitting right at resistance of previous wild run on reopening hopes. I can see it drop sharp 5 % tmr? Feeling cute, might buy some 0dte fds on it
Not sure about municipalities in particular, but my comment, as well as the one in the article, was regarding increasing the gap between big money and small people
Sure, but he kept doubling down even after the Fed intervention... he was right in the sense that pretty much everyone who knows economics 101 would have predicted how fucked we were. But feds are a real thing, they stepped in back in 08, so to say he was right until fed came in is absolutely fucking brain dead pointless isn‚Äôt it

Imagine if pltr pumps 20% in a day. We will all sell and run
Do they? Let me guess, you just heard "they are backed by the ccp" on Reddit.

NIO does not have the government's support, it is only backed by Hefei, a second tier city.

Nobody drives NIO in China, BYD is much more popular. Even TSLA is more preferred
What do you disagree with them on?
I‚Äôm almost completely numb to it now. See my other comment in this thread about losing almost 82k, and that isn‚Äôt even the first time my account‚Äôs been blown up. If I lost it all again I‚Äôd feel almost nothing. I know it ain‚Äôt right but it‚Äôs how it is.

I come here to have my confirmation bias challenged. 

I filter out 90% of the screaming voices and allow my thoughts/plans to be challenged by differing perspectives. I not only try to avoid my own mistakes, but am reminded daily by the life-crippling mistakes of others.

I see little league batters swinging for the fences at every at-bat instead of getting on base by any means. I'm willing to lean into a pitch to get on base. That's how you manufacture runs.

When I get the itch to try for FU money, I read loss porn here. Then I go back to churning out a few hundred a day writing covered calls and cash secured puts. The last six months have been steady and rewarding.

Shorter-dated options increase in value faster, and there is no way this takes until 2022.
Buy high sell low.

But TSLA will probably run up a bit more in the next two weeks, you'll be fine.

You've given me a lot to process, thank you! I wasn't thinking about selling puts on spy I was thinking about possibly buying them or entering some sort of near term downward directional position .

PLTR long hold, that‚Äôs gonna be a $200 stock
I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt. Same shit was being said in August. Even the news today both sides had to backtrack and essentially say Schumer was talking out his butt. It seems they‚Äôre talking about government funding and maybe had a side conversation about it and that‚Äôs about it

I actually agree with you. The market has never seen something squeeze with such a massive short interest. Nobody knows the top. People have these bitch ass price targets at $30-$50. 

With this high short interest? Get the fuck out. Anything under $100 would disappoint me.

How much are you going to lose tomorrow?
Inverse this strategy everyone.
Why would anyone want a 1 seater though? You can forget about taking a partner out in one of those let alone going on road trips with friends and it's got next to no storage.

It would be one thing if it were in the lower-mid 4 digit range but it's 20k per car. For that price I'd want something that I'm going to keep for 5-10 years. And fundamentally this car makes no sense for the next decade of anyone's life unless they plan on being single, friendless, and not popping out a single child for the next 5-10 years.

It‚Äôs easier to make kids spend than parents.

Sure, parents would most likely limit their kids access to money, but their kids are in the end allowed to spend. There are those who can‚Äôt, but who said you need everyone to be your customer to be profitable?

Higher probability of revenue but with a ceiling. The shortcomings of this model is amortized when you have a large audience. 1 dollar from each of 1 million people makes 1 million dollars, for example.

I'm somewhat comforted that there isn't some grand conspiracy out to get us, at least that we know of. For a while I was slightly paranoid that the "smart money" actually did flee the market in August and September, and retail was left holding the forever bag.

Well the market bounced, hit ATHs, and now even XLE holders have been given an exit point if they wanted. We're all in this together.
Constituents on both sides are starting to get pretty fed up. Dems know that they lost house seats because of their stonewalling, and Schumer and Mitch have to think about the upcoming Senate races. No stimulus helps no one at this point. I'm sure they'll compromise.

Back in September after NVDA had that RTX event, I was talking a shit at work and without even thinking about it, put my whole account into calls for the day after.

I made like 9k dollars the next day on that alone and after I sold it I didn't even feel anything. I just wanted to put it in something else as it I could just leap frog these piles of money to try to get a higher score.

I put most of it in 1 month apple calls and we all know how that went.

Short answer: yes
There's zero chance a mail courier service is going to buy those in bulk at that price. There's little to no benefit to them doing that, the utility of such a tiny car is minimal to DHL.

How often do you see compact DHL vehicles driving around?

Odds are they're going to buy maybe a few for PR purposes but stick to larger vans and trucks for the bulk of their fleet. Maybe even hop on board some larger EV.

They should just raise the PT to 300, bull run, and then have citron make another report and drop it to 100. Trade sideways for a few hours, and have another bull run.

I was part of the contractor crew that turned dollar trees into dollar general.

Parts weren‚Äôt sent on time half the jobs so we just sat in a hotel out of state on double salary and shit like that. And we had electrician crews straight up smoking weed in the middle of the store not working even after complaining to corporate about the company 

Basically management is dumb and those 17,000 stores weren‚Äôt as good for the company as it sounds

I said it‚Äôs unique Becuase you said not even Volkswagen went up that much in terms of %. But whatever. we know that GME has a very low float, most of it is locked up by institutions. 140% of shares are sold short, Literally some shorts own fake shares that don‚Äôt even exist. If you want, you can compare it to OSTK, which was 70% short and squeezed from 15 to 130, but that was a longer squeeze, I‚Äôm expecting a quick one. If Cohen puts out a tender offer for GME and it‚Äôs voted yes by shareholders, all the shares lended out by institutions gotta be recalled, shorts will scramble to cover, but most of them won‚Äôt even be able to cover day one, since they don‚Äôt even have real shares borrow. There would be a fail to deliver shares, and it‚Äôd just be madness. They would be forced to buy at insanely high bids and drive up the price. KBIO was a similar situation, Shrekli bought the company and borrowed shares had to be recalled. That caused a 10k% squeeze, and I believe that was also about 70% short. Also, insane amounts of calls will be bought and MM‚Äôs will have to buy more shares to hedge. GME is the most short sold stock in history by a long shot, it‚Äôll do wild things, you can‚Äôt gauge the situation, that‚Äôs why my PT is unreal

Yeah not having read too much about Moderna it seems weird that they're different. 

RNA is notorious for degrading all the fucking time, I remember doing RNA extractions n school and having to spray the shit out of everything with RNAse away.

My question would be if this requirement is different because of actual differences in the drug or if it's just Pfizer being more conservative with their stability data.

Me too, we were too late on GME is all. I actually got my first ten bagger off AYRO calls today. I made $35 from $3... I should have bought more than one call...
This is me just nit picking... Overall agree with everything you laid out, bravo!

Regarding premise 3 I would just say that the Fed has already broken the law by purchasing corporate bonds. They side stepped the law by using a SPV and Black Rock.

It's not inconceivable that the Fed, with the help of Congress because it will be seen as necessary, can pull a Japan and start buying stock ETF's (if I'm not mistaken it's already in the contact with Black Rock that they can do so).

I like this DD for a couple reasons that op missed. First of all why are we posting a DD on a company consistently posting net loss? Because the money they owe is planned to be paid off with this IPO. So how does the future look for them? Telos reported revenue from sole sourced government contracts. This is gravy for them that they can probably keep riding. If the contact isn't bid that means it's recurring so they could have this revenue guaranteed for years to come (could be 10+). Short term this company has some issues hopefully the IPO can help out with but they look similararly solid to PLTR for a long stock. No calls buy shares and hold.
Same - Sold my 42.50 calls last week just under the high at $53 for a nice 205% gain, then watched it tank to 41 and bought the rest of my position with some of those profits, it was glorious!

Of all the stocks to not buy far OTM puts though...good luck.
Don't you think it already jumped the last two times because of beats and probably everyone already figured it'll have a good holiday season?

That takes no foresight. If anything, i feel like this is going to be a run up to earnings day and then a dump on beat. I'm already itching to downvote the waves of idiots posting about "Why's it down 5% after such a good earnings call!?"

Either way, there's a bet to be placed here.

 In case you are wondering why this index is not moving. Because it‚Äôs a limt down 7%. It immedietly went down 7% when future opens at 6. Thats why it is stuck at .10% down.

Because my mom would tell me things like "Why aren't you studying for your courses?" and "You've been at your current job for eight months, just because [Super spooky DoD contractor, one you've heard of] wants to recruit you and move you out of Ohio at a 60% raise doesn't mean you should do it, it'll look like you leave jobs too quickly."

But fuck, I hate Ohio so goddamn much. And my current employer, [Only moderately spooky DoD contractor], isn't giving me as much as I would've hoped to reimburse tuition while I finish up my undergrad part time.

Mask on. They didn‚Äôt seal out a damn thing lol
Normal people AND austistical people would typically concur with your DD.  But what you haven't factored in is the fact that stationary bike companies are trading at 900 PE and PFE is trading less than 5% above pre announcement levels.  You can't use your type of logic for DD.  We are a bubble nation for as long as bubbles last.  The only way your bet works is if everything crashes in which case there exist a boatload of other stocks that will fall harder than a vegas casino.

Either way, best of luck Comrade.  I hope your positions prove me wrong :D

It was never supposed to be gone by the summer. That‚Äôs why everyone was spending billions on vaccine... Mask doesn‚Äôt make virus disappear, it slows it down. Also, when this was filmed, we didn‚Äôt even have COVID-19.
If EVs have a successful market penetration in Europe, these 3 wheels, small car types could be successful. I lived in Spain for a year and mopeds/smart tiny cars were everywhere and allows you to park on popular streets with ease.
don't know why people made fun of Jack Dorsey for looking like a hobo billionaire.  He's at least looks like a regular person.

Almost all the other famous/public facing billionaires look autistic as fuck, like they were born ass first out of their mom's vagina and got strangled by their own umbilical cord.  I mean, just look at Elon musk, Mark Cuckerberg, or fucking Jack Ma.

They lost money on every bolt they sold, so a more limited marketing budget. I believe they still sold quite a few. They just recalled a bunch for catching fire though.

Usually no, since they are pre-merger SPAC. But there is literally no downside risk (shares can be redeemed for $10 cash if merger fails, this won't fail since Bloomberg confirmed), free 50% gain just from shares.

This post is so irresponsible. I agree that the market is showing weakness and is due for a price correction, but this reeks of scare tactics. How many here have lost money listening to doomsayers. The problem with bearish conditions is that they strike hard and fast. The average WSBer can't recognize the bottom or act upon it quick enough. The smart recommendation would be to start reducing long positions and hedge for a correction. Instead of profiting off down market, they should be focused on surviving it so they have the capital to buy the dip when it's safe.

My first instinct is no: you should not be selling puts on spy.

Hear me out, because obviously in the long run the put seller makes more than the call seller. Both should be done at all times, but directionally speaking there‚Äôs much better returns. 

Apple is 6 or 7% of spy. My belief is that apple bricking their old phones, hard, is going to absolutely fuck them up. When you look at an iPhone compared to a google pixel, there‚Äôs no clear winner... but ones half the price. It‚Äôs going to fuck them up a lot more than a 115 million settlement ordered by the government, good ethics are good business. That‚Äôs just my opinion, but if I‚Äôm to treat investing/time decay as my income source then I‚Äôm going to be pretty suspicious of any company over 1 trillion, but apple just has too much to figure out right now. Rest of spy follows, more or less

As far as raw value I can‚Äôt see anything better than weed stocks and particularly aphria as a long term investment... but it helps to keep expectations low because a lot of older, maybe richer people are going to wait a lot longer for that kind of thing before putting their money in even if that‚Äôs what they would want to add to their portfolio. And some are more impatient than others, so there should be both short and long term upside.

Sorry about the block of texts typed this on my phone!

I just really am curious as to what made it go up today, other than shorts covering - renaissance buying in? Earnings play maybe.

Again as I replied to someone else, if banks cared they‚Äôd tighten their margins more on their financing costs comparable to non financials. The banks buy the majority of these mortgages from the non financials to service them anyways. These mortgages rocket and non financials offer are all government backed loans so they‚Äôre all sold on the secondary market. Banks still offer a lot of in house/portfolio mortgages that aren‚Äôt government backed as well which always pick up a market share that doesn‚Äôt qualify for conventional/gov‚Äôt mortgages.

Because unga bunga brain literally only has that money because I'm single and literally all I do after work is go home and play games.

It's just been slowly accumulating in my bank account with 0 investment for the last 10 years. I could've had so much more if I actually tried investing sooner, but covid was the spark I needed to get motivated and try making some profit.

I think it at some point fundamentals need to matter. Like I said above, I am in complete agreement that the thing is unattractive, but I also look at numbers, and their order numbers and zero debt stand out. There's also a huge usage case here for Europe, where the streets are insanely narrow, and both fleet and delivery services. They've also got a couple much better looking car models on the horizon. With the exception of NIO, I'm actually not one for the EV space at all, but I do like the fundamentals and practicality here.

I don‚Äôt get why the munchkin news is a big deal when he‚Äôs leaving office in January and new stimulus package coming, so they‚Äôre returning unused loan funds that were already set to expire in the original stimmy and then new package will just replenish them? People panic sold after hours and big boys frothing at the mouth to pick up this dip before this inevitable economic recovery sends the markets beyond the Oort Cloud
From when? A week ago?
How long have you been here? Very few bears last. I was a bear from July to October, I turned 7k into $600. I became a bull and turned $600 back into 7k in the past month.
We haven‚Äôt seen the worst of corona yet so it‚Äôs all just massive speculation.

Flashbacks to when my puts got destroyed by some random remdesivir news  that drove SPY 3% in 1 day, this market is just built on hopes and dreams
Unless there is concrete evidence, nothing will happen. Luckin coffee only got caught because they investigated themselves. But gsx is still going strong
Has this sub already pumped WTRH? Its like uber eats and grubhub but with a ton of debt. Seems like it should have a retarded spike coming eventually
You overrate the vaccine pump. It briefly brought up lagging sectors but temporarily killed tech, which is the backbone of the current market. NQ would‚Äôve likely made new highs if it wasn‚Äôt for that.  

I do expect more volatility and further corrections though, which is why I‚Äôm mostly in shares and only day trades calls.

The Treasury is effectively ending fed lending facilities for state and muni lending as well as small and mid size corporate lending.
this belongs in r/investing. 


7% on the week only belongs if you were up 60% Monday and down 30% Tuesday, and managed to level it out today. 

Only reason I'm still up 27% is because I guess last Wednesday was real bad. I lost a since yesterday. TGIF's short squeeze cant come sooner.
They threat their customers huh...
No way we go into another national lockdown right?
RemindMe! 24 hours
Because they are industry first. Entrenched...

That means something...

The EVs are already priced as if they are selling millIons of cars. And lets not forget...the car business has razor thin profit margins. Elon has even said they may actually lose money on every car they sell. Cars are a commodity.
EZ fellow tards, he might be on to something all our EV batts need to suck their juice for the tendies from somewhere - I mean there's no like, electricity, in the sun or the moon or the wind

I totally understand up until the repair parts, apple is an absolute cunt when it comes to repairs, infact usually local stores wont repair an iphone past a screen or battery replacement bc of how annoying they do things.

I read this post and was super interested in this company and then someone told me to look up what the cars look like and I almost threw up, fuck this guy and fuck this company, anyone who designs a car like that deserves to go belly up
why? cash per share is just how much cash + easy liquid assets the company has. Book per share includes liabilities and all assets.
I agree with this and wished the young crowd wouldn't read this as trash talk but see that you are actually trying to warn them.  Please study 1988, 2000 and 2007/8.  People remained euphoric and bought the dip way, way too long.  Don't think you will see it coming and adjust.  It will be too late.
I'm going to remember and cherish this comment for the rest of my life.

Mnuchin doesn't just speak on his own. That came from higher up. Probably the President not wanting the market to do well on Biden news. Because the market "needs him".

300-400........ not even the volkswagen squeeze did that much % wise relative to GMES price.
Tesla will tank tomorrow. Mark my words.
I genuinely can't believe people are trying to justify these POS EV companies with fundamentals and catalysts. Just take it for what it is, it's hype and smoke & mirrors, these companies are garbage and theres a reason they all traded for $2 a share before they got idiots like us throwing money at the stock.

I don't mean to sound like a bear because frankly I'm not, if theres room to make money by hopping on the bandwagon then by all means make money until you don't know where to put it. Just don't try to justify these gambles with fundamentals and "iNvEsTiNg". 

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.
I understand it's old news to most, but it was new news to me so I wanted to share here to see what the sentiment was like around this company. I understand the profitability piece, but with their cars coming to market in Q1 and zero debt on their books I'd say they're set up for success.

Hedge funds bought Palantir around $10-15, retailers are running this up to $19. Guess who already profited and will be selling.

This is old DD they already announced the first factory opening a few weeks ago. While I'm sure it will keep pumping when the rug finally pulls SOLO and many of the other EV's will end up just like weed stocks a big dump and then a slow grind back down to all time lows until they can prove profitability.

Munchkin took away loans no one wanted. DIX was mega bullish. I think tomorrow is green.
Rocket mortgage/quicken loans has some of the highest margins in the industry. Where do you get that they have low costs?
Maybe up a little here and there but general trend is still down.  I don't think it's time yet for gold calls.  After the stimulus, perhaps, then I'm going heavy on long calls.  I bet GDXJ sees $40 by February.

Yeah it seems like the more worthless the option is the more leverage it has to fuck you with. That's why I aim to enter the short end of the spread after or during a run up, locking in some of the profit from the long end. Should I be trading puts too? I have a bad feeling about this spy quadruple top.

Nah it's my fault to be honest. The ones I follow from this sub end up tanking and being wrong so inversing would of worked. But the ones I don't follow end up doing well. I didn't do PLTR NIO or CRSR or SNAP or PIN so if you tried to inverse any of those you were fked.

This is sad. You are basically saying, I think some guy with some track record can call a correction within 1-2 months. Just because you took on some serious tone doesn‚Äôt mean this should be taken seriously. 

You guys were a dime a dozen in March. Everyone just says what it looks like. If you‚Äôre actually smart, you actually won‚Äôt change a fucking thing, and keep stuffing it in the market and get paid even more when it dips. If you don‚Äôt, you lose. I understand it‚Äôs gay retardation central to say that here but it‚Äôs literally the only truth.

Cool story, earlier this year i bought a house for 30k. I put 20k into with repairs in 29 days with less than 15 hours of my personal time spent there. Sold it for 80k almost instantly. After fees and taxes, made a quick 14k. It was easy with little to no risk. Yet here i am, blowing thru money in the market like the retard i am. Cheers

yep people here have it so easy with 0 comissions just a few years before Robinhood it was from $5 to $20 per trade. 

Now think how many people would buy way out of the money options worth $50 when they gotta pay $20 in commissions and how much it has to grow to break even.
Inverse yourself if you make the wrong trade most times.
GM and Ford are having to replace their ICE vehicles with EVs in terms of production. Explain to me why their value should increase? They'll probably be selling the same number of vehicles once they fully transition over to EVs.

I like how your first lower high is immediately followed by a new all-time high. Meanwhile the lows have been going higher as well. Trade the market in front of you rather then what you think it should be. There‚Äôs high volatility because of the Fed, the pandemic, and a divorce from fundamentals, but volatility doesn‚Äôt necessarily equal bearish. Tons of experienced traders on fintwit have either blown themselves up or missed the entire rally because they thought a crash was imminent. They splooge themselves with every big 10% correction, and then they immediately lose all their gains when the market rallies hard.
Haha I know right. I will probably try to make one next year when I have more time. I just don't like the feeling of someone potentially losing money because they didn't understand what was I was trying to say about a stock.

When does the year start for long term cap gains on shares purchased from exercising an option? If I exercise an option I bought over a year ago, do I have to hold the shares for another year?

I hear you.  

I placed a 100k SPY 260P 1/15/21 bet in June.  You see how that worked out.  This could very easily turn out wrong due to the markets something something irrational something solvent something.
Logic yes - but in this clown market you are better off inverse so calls on Expedia.
Bought BA at the top, and spy at the top. They‚Äôre expire tomorrow üò≠
What do people realistically think TSLA can hit end of year? 600 is obviously a long shot. Does anyone believe 550 is a realistic scenario?

As a representative of the 4th reason you listed, I'm going to say 'Jokes on you!' because after losing over $100k on TSLA puts since March, I'm making it back again on NIO because I've learned I need to buy calls on retards.
Did you spam the daily with shitty price predictions? You know you did. The sub has gone soft.

*NIO will be this. PLTR will be that. SPY will go down. SPY will go up.*

So, what are we looking at now that it looks like Biden is going to implement student loan forgiveness. So far I've seen numbers between $10,000 to 100% forgiven but, no matter what the amount ends up being it looks like it will happen. Which companies will benefit from this phantom "cash in pocket" that lots of people are suddenly going to find themselves with?

As a fellow Canadian the best feeling is profiting off the American economy taking a hit
It's criminal that they got this shit approved but not the Regeneron cocktail.

yeah i hope i'm wrong too, as it would fuck most people here. although I frequent WSB, i'm actually not the YOLO/FD type, so the dilution possibility still makes me uneasy to keep going with TSLA.

Clearly you don‚Äôt buy much considering how shitty your plays are.
Think of it like poker. Don‚Äôt go all in on a high card. Shares are cool, but do you ever plan on holding any share for more than 3 years if you‚Äôre a trader?  You‚Äôd buy something with the idea that it moves within a year right? Smaller options proportional to your belief that it‚Äôll come true gives you more plays and leverage with less cash
Tesla in 10 years? X10
Tesla in 2 years? Easily over 1000
Tesla in 2 months? Could be 450, could be 1000

For 2 years or 2 months if you believe hard enough why not take a potential x2 to 1000 and turn it into a x2.5

The PT might be wrong, the timing might be wrong, but the direction is completely right. TSLA is a cult stock not worth a quarter of what it trades at. Shady accounting, lying CEO, shoddy quality (see Consumer Reports), weak revenue growth, selling self-driving capabilities that are not as advertised, and on and on. 

Everyone in a cult always believes. Be it MAGA, Scientology, Jonestown, or Christianity. You may be in a cult. Here's some reading if you want out of this cult: https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/tsla.pdf

Are you saying overpriced in historical sense or since pre covid? Because unless you jumped in recently, regardless if the down leg I doubt it will be lower than March.


Also, one of your stimulus "trigger" isn't exactly truthful. Schumer announced today his office and Mitch's are talking about that very topic.
It peaked at morning, the way people were talking about it you'd think it was going to at least $20 today. Did not bode well that it had a side ways day after initial open

First time I‚Äôve ever hedged my portfolio of heavy calls with a weekly SPY puts. Got 25 contracts SPY 11/20 360p for $2.10 on Tuesday. Deep red tomorrow would atleast break me even and maybe even slight profit. If we are green then my call profits will outweigh the loss of the puts. Is this the way?

Positions: 
WMT $150c 1/21 for $4
COTY $3c ‚Äò22 for $1.1
PFE $40c March 21 for $1.15
GLW $40c March 21 for $.95

NIO has support of Chinese government. They can literally only make people buy their EV's if they want.
I honestly was really thinking this guy had a great piece until he stated his positions that expire in 2020 LMAO. Seriously, not even a month out? Macro corrections from euphoria take time to develop and can go on much longer than you would ever expect.
That‚Äôs because the euphoria peak of 54 actually was retarded prior to earnings and price target upgrades. Ignore that shit. It‚Äôs erroneous data caused by all of retail fomoing into one stock. 

NIOs high for the day broke past the previous high since the Citron report (after the crash from 54). We‚Äôve also had higher lows each day since the drop. 

This is the cup and handle.

Have you considered eating my ass? I wiped like 5 times and even did a couple of "run the TP bundle under the sink water" a few times to make sure it's like 98.5% clean down there.

Just a thought.
Why tf futes recovering?
Beginning balance: $711,424.99
Total gain of day: $10,354.01
Ending balance: $721,424.99

% of Total day gain = total gain of day/beginning balance 

$10,354.01/$711,424.99 = 0.01455

0.01455 = 1.455% ~ 1.46%

I asked my wife‚Äôs boyfriend to help me out. :)
Yah... I know haha.  
There's no way I could've even imagined it would go up like this after an indefinite delay.

Oh well, not the first time I've lost out on killer gains; certainly won't be the last.
why will SPY drop?

If I can do it, you can too! Here's some advice from a fellow autist who came out of the hole.  
Don't go too hard on weeklies, give your options some time.   
Don't fight the momentum.  
Don't double down on loosing positions!

Huh why
Are you out of your mind? The only way you can trade for 20 years profitably is with discipline. Never risking more than 5-10% of account value, taking profits soon and losses sooner. You think those people who drop 500k on low-odds options last very long? There‚Äôs more than enough evidence in this sub of people blowing up their life savings and then some on FDs. Longevity in the market means being smart and being right more than you‚Äôre wrong. If you‚Äôre trading for lambos I give you a year max before you bust out.
Is this some poor people joke I'm too qualified purchaser to understand?

First, just be sure you're considering the fact that even gold and silver were crashing to the floor back in March.  Including it in your TA isn't exactly perfectly logical since everyone was selling everything, every single asset class became correlated at an unprecedented level.

&#x200B;

Also, for those who don't know what MTN is: " **Vail Resorts, Inc.** (MTN) is an American mountain resort company. The company is divided into three divisions. The mountain segment owns and operates 37 mountain resorts in three countries, Vail Resorts Hospitality owns or manages hotels, lodging, condominiums and golf courses, and the Vail Resorts Development Company oversees property development and real estate holdings. The company trades on the New York Stock Exchange, symbol MTN. The company is headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado."

I had no idea what it was until seeing this post and I'm assuming the same for others.

&#x200B;

One last thing, his theory is pretty good IMO, but his execution on the play is seemingly terrible.  The markets are very forward looking, one missed season isn't going to kill 40% of the company's value, and even if it might, why would you want your breakeven scenario to be -45% returns?  Just buy a 260p or 250p and if it hits big, you'll still make a ton of money.  MTN is currently at 276, rebalance to a higher strike OP.

Why are we down HUGE AH?
I'm mostly bearish the past month and agree with you.  Especially any future that is +/- 1 % doesn't seem that significant to me.  QQQ isn't dropping much in AH, SPY is down a bit more, but I find the AH market is the best time to buy shares due to overreactions.
I think about this a lot. As soon as I can make the 20% cash down payment from 50% of my portfolio then its crib time.
Hey everyone, don't listen to this guy. The fed can and does "print money", there is TRILLIONS in liquidity that has no where else to go, it was why the market "recovered".  It's all fake, reasons don't matter, the FED WINS ALWAYS!

Agreed. And the election‚Äôs over. Wish people would move on. 

My point though, is that very few people, whatever they say on camera, whatever their politics, are actually being all that conservative. Most people are eating restaurant food again, going out for non emergencies, having a few friends over, etc. They were either willing to go to Trump rallies, or willing to go to protests and then street parties when Biden was declared the winner. Heck, I doubt most people even wash their hands and sterilize their Amazon packages and groceries like they did back in April. 

And when most people, deep down, aren‚Äôt willing to suffer minor inconveniences for the virus, we‚Äôre not going to have the will to take the damage of another shutdown. Which quite possibly will have tragic consequences, but until it does, the market probably goes up.

What it does. Give it time.
It‚Äôs generally a horrible use of capital and the market is all about opportunity cost. For the pittance that you are getting, you‚Äôre having to take on a lot of risk. Plus the farther out you go the more external risks you expose yourself to (Wirecard, Enron, Lehman Brothers). 

If you‚Äôre a giant investing house and can move in and out and scrape millions of pennies daily, then it‚Äôs worth it, otherwise not much in it for a retail investor

üñïüåàüêª
Wow I‚Äôm so retarded I don‚Äôt even know how to check futures on Bloomberg or MW now that Investing.com is down.
I‚Äôve timed every SPY call and put wrong this week after two weeks of perfection. Finally just broke down and bought a 4/16/21 $357 call with half of my little account at about 2:45. I think SPY has dropped $3 after hours since. I feel like there‚Äôs gonna be a big correction at some point before the vaccine is widespread but hopefully at some point before like January while my call still has some theta value SPY will get back up over $360 so I can make a little cash. Those short term calls were gonna give me an untimely stroke if I kept goin with those
There‚Äôs going to be a big bump when a vaccine gets emergency fda approval next month
The stock will get destroyed if enough people see this video and sell the shit out of it. Or it could get investigated.
Everyone wears masks there - since you are like 2 years old - even before the pandemic. It‚Äôs part of their social norm - like wearing a scarf.

The main problem is that these resorts make their money from upper class global travelers. Less people flying in and staying at hotels means less revenue for the company. 

The high end ski resorts in Colorado make tons of revenue from 1) people from the northeast who don‚Äôt like to ski on ice 2) Midwesterners (still good during COVID), and 3) Mexico City tourists (none this year).  1 and 2 will be reduced, and 3 will be non-existent. That said, I wouldn‚Äôt short them. But I also wouldn‚Äôt try to go long either. Better plays out there.

Yeah, Nancy was adamant about a 2.2 trillion stimulus and refused to compromise at 1.88 trillion. Even her fellow advisors thought she should have accepted the 1.88 trillion and see if it will pass through the Senate.

Now whether or not it would have passed, especially through McConnel is uncertain. 

The fact of the matter is Nancy cucked a 1.88 trillion dollar stimulus package from going to the Senate. Do you get this or are my facts wrong?

Because they have a moral duty to protect their subordinates. If a parent bet on how many times their child would be raped, and then personally did so to hit their number, no morally or mentally normal person would be high fiving them for their 200 IQ strategy.

&#x200B;

There's a huge difference between fighting over "tendies" with fellow degenerates and some single mom suffocating to death because she wanted to make rent and her employer is indifferent to employee deaths.

&#x200B;

There's also a self-interest aspect to this. Anyone willing to plow dead employees into the dirt is willing to do the same to customers. If you're a vegan or only eat locally farmed elite chicken, that's one thing, but I eat chicken products, so I'd prefer a "zero body count" philosophy to rule decision making.

So 12/18 SPY $400 calls is it. Got it.
Unemployment, QE deflationary, markets overvalued, ppl have been saying this for years even before the covid crash, then ppl doubled down during the crash and after the crash despite NASDAQ blowing through ATHs. A lot of stocks are still very cheap, most of the rally was/is fueled by tech, who are making record gains, have zero cash flow problems, in fact they have even more cash now because they cut a lot of cost... market pricing in a world where tech has completely taken over, which it kind of has. Are there overvalued companies? For sure, but that‚Äôs always been true. Interest rate at zero means these big tech companies can take out cheap loans to invest in even more growth, wallstreet has been sleeping on tech for years now, most of them only look at balance sheets, which doesn‚Äôt mean much for companies that are literally taking over/disrupting entire industries. Do you know anyone working in tech? You should talk to them instead of listening to a bunch of suits with useless MBAs

More oil and gas calls.  They are all still really cheap and that oil price staying stable over 40.  The rest of the market is super expensive, but oil and gas is cheap.  All those boomers that went from 50 to 10 this year.  Buy at 10 and pick up the recovery.

Come to the dark side and switch to Fsly. Just starting to rip again. Hit $62 at the bottom and has stayed over $80 the last two days. I see it at $90 within next 2 weeks.

Logitech is very fairly priced right now. It declined with stay at home stock with vaccine announcement last Monday which wasn't warranted, has been recovering ever since. I think it goes up another 10% in the next 2 weeks.

I dunno man. Are you considering MGM's ownership abroad, like in China where Covid19 is so 2019?  It's basically business as usual over there.  Also, MGM is into online sports betting a al Draftkings with BetMGM.  Online betting is expanding and legalized in additional states as of a few weeks ago.  That will lead to additional revenues beyond their B&M casinos.

Thank you so much for taking the to help me today, I really appreciate it. I've never been in this position (no pun intended) before.

This is the way
Cali shutting down
Mortgages are loans secured by the house/land. 


The closest/shadiest thing you can do now is to take out a personal/student loan and deposit it in  a brokerage account. Then, you would apply for a margin account, which essentially uses the personal/student loan as collateral. 

This is probably fraud, but brokerages most likely aren‚Äôt very stringent in fighting this kind of thing since if it goes belly-up, it‚Äôs the original lender getting screwed and not Robinhood/TD ect. . 

To anyone reading,do not do this kind of thing unless you‚Äôve consulted with an attorney to make sure it isn‚Äôt considered fraud. It‚Äôs also just a generally bad idea overall.
TSLA down 1% ah
Theta about to skull fuck you brother
Keep in mind post covid cut back in business travel and Airbnb imo will squeeze a lot of hotels only ones that will survive will be the ones tied to water parks and theme parks.
Good luck fellow retard. I‚Äôm glad this motivated you.
SPM puts seem like the better dagger out of all of them. Record lows for Black Friday will be sure to bring it down, plus the lottery pick of a state lockdown.

They red states, they don't believe in masks and science, so therefore they can't believe in something they can't see and will only do what's beneficial for their short term monetary situations aka carry on as normal and hope the coastal states will bail them out before they all die.

Investing update later but I am not sure when
I don't see an easy way to find the exact leaders, although at least one source I looked at said Texas, California, and Florida were in the top 5 with Illinois close behind. 

I think your comment about being locked down when it wasn't bad in the Midwest has a lot of validity. My wife's business was closed for two months before we had almost any spread in Ohio. At the time, it was sold as a brief lockdown to give government time to prepare. While things aren't locked down anymore, I don't think people were given the impression their kids' educations would still be largely on hold eight months later.
use RH app/site
Mmmmm with how zoom moves and iv pumping like a penis pump it‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt matter, these were lotto plays so I was already expecting to piss away the $640

Even the non serious "simply retirement" investors I know have shifted to bonds with just a small amount in the rest of the market to play the run-up to the crash
You‚Äôre averaging down on puts as the stock runs up? You‚Äôre fucking dumb. Don‚Äôt say rape unless you‚Äôre talking about something serious, you turd.
Actual quotes from Cramer's interview with the Robinhood co-CEO:

RH CEO:  "Robinhood investors acted as a stabilizing force during the volatility and the crash."

RH CEO:  "I think a large part of it is the time horizon.  People who are investing for the first time in their 20s or 30s have a very different outlook than people who are maybe a handful of years from retirement.  When you're younger you know there's decades of compound returns and decades of riding out the ups and downs of the market."

CRAMER:  "These people are smarter than we were and are.  Vlad, I'm not kidding, your people are incredibly well-versed in the companies they buy."

i know how to read and how to right now. here on to be on reddit is not common for my background. i am the first man in my family.

After corona start, I promise myself and all my family that I will be first boy done with hs and in 4 years, and for boys that is very important. spelling is hard and now when I see other spelling like you right "incoherent" we say it like " i can here (or hear  it" it sounds like apart and more right here bc i know on reddit its only for genius  on this sub very special genius. i hope to make more friends on zoom calls to trade information and inside information even. everyone on reddit knows outsid einformation with % bc they talk about it outside. in library (hard word to spell and to say to. i have to practice there because it is more easy to read, write and think. i love thinking and reddit name still make me think after 6 years on here.

i was scared to be right with this inside information on here bc i know you all are the very smartest from the us and world but mostly us bc they dont have wall street in other countries and lands.

and now with liberal/leftist after russia bats were starting to be everywhere and you can not tell bc they talk with outside voice and use outside informarion, then they change to inside voice and information. and when you read it (right and read like last time were problem to right on here. even tho, i know how to read but was not 100% to do it here and bc they invited here and then i was confirmed (after i took the classes on the interwebz b4 Corona, 2020 crazy times) and ready to right on reddit,a nd all because i read it. you guys are weird on wall street bets. or is it bats :) good night biys and girls and parents very lucky to make money with important genius. i will be learning for long time but it will be good for my kids who are 5 and 7.

Bearish factors:

-tendie printer gone 

-market is artificially held up right now 

-Cramer called us intelligent 

Bullish factors:

-Stocks go up 

-record active covid cases 

-talks of possible stimulus talks in 2 months 

-bears think they‚Äôre right this time



Overall: Bullish
Yes. Bought before the March dip, got fucked by listening to boomer then adjusted my strategy. Currently 20%+.

Satellites normally have to pay more to add propulsion systems of their own which cost, money, time, and take up space. SpaceX rideshare program will have drop off locations in orbit for small satellites but those usually are not the final position some satellites want to be in. That is a reason why Momentus is valuable since the have a space tug named Vigoride to do the final delivery. There is only 1 or 2 other companies that could be real competition. I go into more detail in the video.

dunno how long u have been at this shit, or how much time u invest.

, def gonna need some experience, a lot of these dudes here got beginners luck.

i had a straight year of losses until i actually found a strategy(s) that worked for me. given that all of retail is basically retarded now, and this volatile market, i‚Äôve been getting very lucky. 

none of us know shit, but if u see MCD fall after earnings, yet analysts give $220 price target upgrades, its probably wise to buy that dip. and look it worked

figure out what works for ya. gl. it helps if ur poor so $100 is a lot to u, then when lose u learn more

I have bought strikes from $150 up to $190. My thought is that Vail is in a much worst position this year compared to last year. They had to raise debt after the March lockdown so their balance sheet isn‚Äôt as healthy. If their stock dropped to $135 after only missing the tail end of their most profitable quarter last year. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it went lower with a shutdown at the beginning of their most profitable quarter

Which news are you referring to?
Here's the dirty secret about TA:    
      
Everyone adjusts their charts to be right.      
   
Besides psychological supports and resistances, stocks mostly move based on speculation, events and breaking news. When you try to back test a function or analysis based on the numbers, you have to start making so many adjustments or exclude data to make it make sense.
Who's doing this service currently, that Momentus would be replacing?  For example, if I pay SpaceX to take my satellite up, does my satellite have to position itself?  Or does SpaceX do that? Or does it just stay wherever SpaceX dumped it in space?  


I know satellites control their orientation, but never thought about them having to get moved around the earth.

You may be wrong about the dilution, as other said : it has already been diluted. This is not like other inclusions however as for the market cap of this company. Will it ever be as big as google or amazon? Probably not. They may keep an advantage but being one of the first in a market doesn't necessarily mean staying the best. That's competition, and that's okay, they won't disappear any time soon.  

You are fucking right however about cashing in though. Isn't it the goal, to make money? Fuck the retards who'll call you paper hands, you made a profit, congrats.

And fuck off to /r/investing for not yoloing on calls, I should know, I'm a retard /s

Thats exactly what im saying. There needs to be more pain in order for a large stimulus to pass. 

But I disagree with your comment that the Republicans messed up the stimulus. If you will recall that towards the end of October Mnuchin offered a 1.88 trillion dollar package which Nancy declined! Had she agreed, it would have gone through the Senate and had a shot at passing.

While I somewhat agree with what you‚Äôre saying, the covid stimulus package is not only focused on the stockmarket , it also has the paychecks to households etc. So I don‚Äôt think it would need to get so bad for them to sign and agree on a deal. Further, America wants to stay on top and China‚Äôs massive economical bounceback makes US more likely to pass a bill sooner rather than later. Only limiting factor is who gets the credit (and Biden said he no longer cares about that). It might be sooner than you think

We‚Äôre going to melt up before we crash. It‚Äôs kind of essential. The market has to be extra bullish for things to collapse. Right now people are too bearish because we‚Äôre dancing around ATH, so any dip people sell and buy puts. Only an over-leveraged market will allow the crash that is desperately needed

Heres my theory:

In order for a 2- 3 trillion stimulus package to pass the senate, there needs to be some major volatility in the stock markets. How can you say with a straight face that a stimulus package of that size is needed right now with stock markets at ATH.

Back in March a 2.2 Trillion stimulus package was passed within weeks only because the stock market was limiting down like every day.

My take is they tank the SPY below 300, start turning up the covid-19 news coverage and states start issuing stay at home orders. Only then will there "motivation" for another large package to pass.
What is this in response to?
As long as CRSR and PLTR don‚Äôt dump, I‚Äôll probably be fine

the only good news about this tantrum is that it has to be helping georgia democrats in the senate race. there's no way trump is actually gaining voters with this charade...
Pffft...mango is gonna pump this guys. He will see criticism of the fed decision and probably do some shit cause he loves seeing stock market numbers up...I don't think he'll try crashing the market untilright before inauguration. And I'm not a mango fan lmao.
Pltr puts please (I got calls)
But what about all the issues they had/have with the builder they were contracted with? It doesn't seem like those issues are resolved so who's going to build them. It just feels like NKLA, at least NKLA has something going on with GM, and who knows what that will be.

GM up 26% in the last month, 46% in the last 3 months. Ford up 14% in the last month, 29% in the last 3 months.

I think Tesla and NIO are skewing your perception of bull stocks. Those are pretty massive gains by any non-meme stock standard. They are gaining very fast.

If it‚Äôs purely virus fear, money in stocks will move from value plays to stay at home plays. If it‚Äôs recession fears money will move from stocks to something more stable. So the question is why are we selling off?

FED can basically no longer guarantee loans.  Banks won't eat those losses now, so what are they gonna do?  Not lend.  Ever see what happens to a country when there is a credit liquidity freeze? Economic collapse. Trump admin is basically neutering the FED who kept the Great Depression 2 from happening.

All are logical explanations. People have been working on mRNA for decades. This is not new. Yes, the storage reqs. are an issue, but imagine if you could create a viable vaccine with mRNA? The possibilities are endless. 

Somehow this still smells like market manipulation. I have no doubt that the scientists behind are doing their best and that we will get the vaccine one way or another, but I would be really cautious betting for or against these stocks.

15k -> 18k 

I wonder tomorrow
This is neither bullish or bearish for any stock. It is simply planning on ending programs that were barely used.
But like when‚Äôs the breakthrough, when does the tech become actually used
Immediately what I thought as well
My father taught me that a trader does not even need to know what the company does, in order to trade it. You trade in and out on technicals. This is true here because many WSB members have been making a killing on these EV trades, yet they don‚Äôt even know what the vehicles look like, or even how many are sold.

Now an investor should know the fundamentals. Although he calls investments ‚Äútrades that went wrong.‚Äù

$208 is what i‚Äôve been getting in on my short dated weekly scalps.

$212.5-$215 definitely means it‚Äôs breaking out, but as u can see if u bought there in this past week (with options especially) u wud be down right now.

to answer ur question, id say $210-212.5. 

The earnings is still a wee bit away, and considering how CVS, a stock with a huge catalyst, was at a 52 week low before earnings, wouldn‚Äôt surprised me if this stock gets beat up until earnings. Dunno bro.

Damn who said?
if you're asking about NNDM in a roundabout way it's a good long term play. Short term it's been great but off of no news or catalysts. Buy leaps or boomer shares.

I really need WDAY to go back up to $244, mkay?
Okay, so MMs don‚Äôt have any positions in the market, but they are essentially who you are buying/selling from every time you trade. When you buy some stock, they sell it to you. But since they don‚Äôt own stock, they‚Äôre technically ‚Äòshort selling‚Äô those stocks. That‚Äôs why short volume in the market is typically 50% of market volume. This also applies to Dark pools. Dark pools are where big league traders exchange millions and billions of dollars of stock without affecting market price, because they aren‚Äôt done through public exchanges. But Dark pools still have MMs, and so whenever stocks are bought in a dark pool, some MM is short selling them. You can track these short sales and use it to determine trading preference in the dark pools. Anything above 45% is bullish, anything below is bearish.
I gotchu but if you put in 30k with a 50/50 to make 200% gains. That‚Äôs just retarded. And way too safe. I put in 600 with 1% chance of making profit and .00001% chance of making a 100 bagger.

Regardless of what WMT MCD do, DG, I think, is not worth $208. don‚Äôt be surprised if it moves to $220 before earnings and u got on a nice scalp.

i posted this DD cuz i felt there were several ways to play this, the most probably and best might just be $210 12/18 calls lol

I think my retarded ass found the perfect hedging strategy. Put credit spreads on VXX. Stonks go down and I‚Äôll make my max profit with VXX rising. Stonks go up and my stonks make a lot of money, and with a 10-15% OTM spread I can still hit max profit on VXX if stonks don‚Äôt go up an insane amount. And if they do, that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll eat a small loss on the spread or roll out

What are the top states for covid deaths in the last month? All those states you mentioned got hit pretty hard early. Midwest states didn't get hit but were told to lockdown, which is probably why more of them thought it was a hoax. Now they're getting fucked. Not arguing just my 2 cents

Annnnnnnd Treasury takes the punch bowl away from the Fed and like clockwork the market throws a tantrum. Now watch what happens if Congress continues to drag their feet on stimulus. 1987 crash type scenario which will immediately provide stimulus and more money printing. Wall Steet wins.
I bought on Tuesday right before the final dip, which kinda pissed me off.  Lost some value on day zero so even with a +72% day on the 11/27's today, I'm only up 10% from where I bought.  I expect more green days than red over the next week tho.  I wouldn't be surprised if it hits $220 again next week while it starts running up to earnings.
This shit looks retarded... i‚Äôm in!
At some point they have to start raising it by .25%. When that happens load up on as many puts as you can easy 10 baggers
I‚Äôm just pissed. I had 40, 11/20 352p that I sold for a 60% loss. Probably would‚Äôve been better off holding but it was better than losing 100% in my opinion. I just shouldn‚Äôt have bought calls..

You want to buy otm and itm options that are cheap.  How do you know of they are cheap?? Well you need to watch options prices and when they drop.

The next step is Tesla and Apple will be up.

So I'd go with Tesla calls. Expensive, but it will touch 540 soon.
SOY? 

SOIL?

Careful with spacs, they can go down faster then they came up. Also you need to read the rules carefully, % of ownership. I dont really like the ideas guys that have no product, no revenue maybe something in 2025. These guys have to go the Spac route because they wouldnt be able to IPO otherwise.

Havent looked at CIIC that much yet, 7% ownership of the merger company is on the thin side. If you wanna buy it you will probably get a better price soon when the FOMO crowd loses patience.

Out of the EV spacs I like SBE, but it already had a large run and recently the warrants I have went up quite a bit. Should have bought more.

TSLA is a lotto because of a potential gamma squeeze. r/options had an intersting call fly (butterfly spread) trade idea to catch the momentum: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jx16id/tsla_momentum_tradebought_1000_nov_call_flys_that/

Then out of chinese ones XPEV and LI are less overvalued than NIO, if you can stomach the "luckin coffee" risk you can sell puts to the WSB crowd. WSB is trying to time the top driving put premiums up. Alternatively buy long dated ITM calls.

Things not looking good right now.
Was just at best buy last night and their PC aisle was STOCKED with all kinds of corsair stuff: keyboards, mouses, mouse pads, gaming pads, memory, cpu AIO coolers, power supplies, etc. They are the real deal should honestly be THE name in PC components. 

On a side note I fucking love that Best Buy is starting to carry more PC components. I honestly think if Gamestop would go all out on stocking tons of PC components specifically for PC gamers, they could get a lot of business from that. I'd much rather go buy a delicate high end PC component from a local store than buy it offline if I had the option.

As the price of PMs possibly rise like you predict, the supply will flood in. I don't think there will be an explosion of prices, but a gradual increase over a period of many years until supply can catch up. Mines will also be nationalized if the price goes high enough. Mining is still a tough business in which to be profitable.

First check to make sure 1 isn't delayed. Second, if they are in sync, you have to match it up to the close times. SPY AH is always matched to the 4 PM close. Futures might be marked to 415 or 430. Technically you as a trader should only care about it vs 4 since that's your last pnl update.
This simple question is a 5sec Google. If you really wanna learn about options use OIC. The option industry council. They have a YouTube channel and educational video starting for people with 0 knowledge. Just take your time and watch it
these programs + QE are why SPY is above 200 right now

Are you planning to hold calls through earnings?  And if so which ones are you thinking? With the IV so low now this could be a winner I think.  Especially if there's a market sell off tomorrow which brings DG lower.  Thanks for the DD.

Googled them. Those are the ugliest fucking cars I have ever seen.
The market cap is actually around 1.3-1.5b. Assume you are just thinking about the money they raised.
[deleted]
Like some have already said, consider the cost/benefit of getting a mortgage instead of buying a house outright. Even at a high interest rate you can easily beat it in returns on a simple SP500 investment.
I think tomorrow is a good day to just look around the office very bewildered, wondering how we got this point. Then sweat for like 10 minutes, then just  buy the dip...sigh.
Position?
WTf now Roblox is filing to go public!?
What he do?
Eh, I like to be deep ITM in the account I bought this on. My RH I‚Äôll make plays like that.
Not necessarily, the S&P 500 will have to buy shares of Tesla, last I saw about 50 billion dollars worth, and it will drive Tesla's price up for people who are invested in Tesla. After they get their position, they rebalance every so often, and they will either sell or buy based on the market cap of S&P 500 companies.

Basically, they only get gains after they buy, like we do, so if it continues to go up after they buy, yes. If it corrects after the large demand from the index subsides, then no.
Cool thanks

Well Mnuchin just turned this into a bear market.

Yeah here's the problem: this sub was bullish until close. It went bearish after everyone was locked into their positions.

Holding puts is the profitable inverse in action.
Hey retards buy FCEL I‚Äôm not trying to manipulate the market in favor of my $6 calls at all
hmm you may be right, and if it thought this way years ago, I'd be up on AMZN. But I doubt that price entry point is a rounding error...I think it influences volume of buy and sells per day likely. Not that it really matters long term.

I copped 20 1/15/2021 $260 calls for $40 each for the lols. gonna lose on this last one prolly, but i‚Äôll cop the 12/18s and make it back and more

thanks for your input homie, appreciate it, read every word and should have had ur knowledge in my DD

also those shorter-dates 11/27s are ficking hot bro, omg if u copped when underlying was $208 in fucking hard dudep. nice job spotting obvious support.  hoping to see $215 before earnings, if lucky $220, then after i exit at $230/$240.

Impulse decisions are usually wrong.. for instance, when you see a stock move down that you own your gut reaction will be sell and run to safety (realizing loss in the process). Ignore that feeling unless something has dramatically changed with the company/world.

Didn‚Äôt the market just crash in March? Isn‚Äôt that why were all here, trying to ride the wave until the next crash, when the smart dumb thing will once again be to buy the dip, then ride another wave? With the exception of idiots gambling their life savings on risky AF YOLOs who will be wiped out, many of us are waiting for another big buying opportunity. Which may be why it won‚Äôt happen. But then again, I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. 

All that said, hedging isn‚Äôt a terrible idea. Torn between SPY puts or buying into an inverse ETF. Suggestions anyone?

Absolutely BOGGED
in my honest opinion, im a bull on both of these companies. Logitech has the broader market, being a gamer people buy logitech mice, headset and webcams. The last one was the big reason why i kept dumping into logitech, i saw that their orders for the c920 were back ordered because of the high demand. People only really know corsair for their keyboards. I know some people with corsair mice, but they dont compair anything to logitech. 

&#x200B;

for people who dont want to read that paragraph. this sums it up.

mice= logitech

headset= logitech

webcam= logitech

keyboard= corsair
TLDR; bought NIO calls
ay man all i can say is it depends on what option u buy. I got FISV 11/20 $110 calls for their earnings, ended up going -$1500 like you

but i held and it printed 12k

I think DG is gonna. have some CVS like earnings effect, different reasons like with CVS it was vaccine distribution, but DG has similar crazy $250/$260 price targets going into this earnings and i got a feeling something crazy will happen

This is NOT a meme stock. Roblox is a cash cow. 

In the time of young children growing up during a quarantine, they go online to the most accessible game available. They join for free, but quickly discover that the coveted cosmetics cost a few bucks. Mom and dad think 2-3 dollars here and there can‚Äôt hurt. 

And when quarantine ends? Those kids are still loyal to the brand. Heck, teenagers and 20 somethings still play for the nostalgia.

Yeah. But Lordstown will be producing vehicles sooner than NKLA, at lower cost, and with an eye towards fleets rather than individual consumers.
Quite frankly I haven‚Äôt done enough research. I wanted to get on the train but I think I have missed the train.

It's a lagging indicator. It explains why we rallied at close.

It does nothing to help bulls with the AH news and fuckery.
ahahah lmao yes. i will make sure to that next time
let it be red then and I'm balls deep in calls
If you just listen to his predictions from a few months ago they were horribly wrong. He said tesla growth story peaked , in q3 they reported record revenue. He said eu demand is gone, they recently had a record eu month. He said ev credits are going to 0, they have just made a deal with Honda for even more credits, he said they cant be profitable without credits- they were gaap profitable ex credits in q3. He said their fsd is vaporware- released beta version to public , he said battery tech isn‚Äôt proprietary- battery day. I genuinely think he has been wrong with every single thing he has predicted
lmao I remember doing this, it was a dark dark time.
Ooooh thats tasty

And yea I‚Äôm in WSB for the memes (and the occasional healthy discussion) to be quite honest. I‚Äôm finding my feet in the investing world and I‚Äôm yet to find a broker in the UK that doesn‚Äôt rinse me for trading options so I‚Äôm stock only for now. I‚Äôm having a lot of fun though!

You're definitely used to the retards in here because you're arguing something I'm not even saying. He pays 213K. The person he theoretically paid receives the money. I'm not disputing that... 213K exchanged hands. But now it drops to, let's say, 200K. That 13K is now essentially gone. I understand that the seller receives the full 213K. I was remarking on that fact that to the buyer, 13K is gone, but the seller doesn't get an extra 13K, they had already received that in the transaction. So now there is 13K that's just disappeared, even though, as you're saying, the seller received 213K. It was a minor point for making an analogy, but maybe you're just so triggered by the retards in here that you I assumed I was one of them.
You're right this summer in Breck we saw record demand. People want to travel and people don't want to listen to the government. Seeing this build up just feels like last March. If the county decided lodging is prohibited the resort is going to suffer.

What's happening:

Lockdowns are coming.  What kept the economy from going to shit?  The FED being able to backstop everything and loans being handed out.  Trump admin is removing all of that protection now.  And lockdowns 2 look like they're coming.  We all fooked.
Bruh, they did what they were suppose to do. Our economy is built on demand and debt. Literally printing money and taking out debt to buy stupid ass shit is the only thing keeping is growing (at slower rates for years btw).

Ok, I read this and I'm an idiot, but it all makes sense- and it is certainly true that the market is completely decoupled from any true economic measures or manifestations.   


So we're looking for a catalyst. I propose and would love to hear other thoughts on this theory: christmas ain't gonna be a christmas like we've ever seen. No travel. No family gatherings means less retail spending. Less restaurant sales, less travels. No stimulus until Biden takes office.   


I think 12/18 is a bit early for that reality to hit. I think first or second week of January.
You think you are? You are and One of us.
I said this about just short of three hours earlier before the bell...

‚Äú I second the mango man dumping the market.

If not, then I see retail following the green ship into the close and then MM crushing every option in existence tomorrow for OpEx.

Perfect Setup. Didn‚Äôt shake me out of my VXX hedge. If neither happen, will go with trend an average down insurance hedge. GL. ‚Äú

I didn‚Äôt consider that it‚Äôd be a statement from MNUCHIN that would conveniently be released just in time for OpEx.

Do your feet dangle on the toilet too?   


Get a booster seat. lmao.
not even being sarcastic at all good fucking call there. it takes balls to go all-in like that but PLTR is not a meme stock they will be around for a very, very long time. I repeat, PLTR IS NOT A MEME STOCK.

I won't urge you to buy shares over options because I realize this is wsb, but if you're scared a bit and not under any short pressure I'd buy shares me.

Dude market is closed. Wait till Europe and Asia pitch in. Blood red.
My man

He got a 60x ROI I‚Äôd take that any day of the week
I think we hit that shit tomorrow at open. Then slowly fade into the 19's. Bounce back next week. Sell when we hit the high.
That's not a meme stock. That's investing in a brand that will grow as this new pandemic generation gets older.
Thanks for the DD.

Yooo When is it expected to go live? And under what ticker
I bought 350p 11/30 yesterday right before the drop.  They went up over 100% today and cashed out what I put in so now I'm playing with house money on these.  Do the same if you do hit 100% because even through the mess today was, I was tranquil and not worried for Sh*t
Either up or down. Or maybe sideways.
I see it mentioned 10 days ago, lame

I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll die by then

Nice you got the time on your plays
I just want to quibble with one point. OP argued that QE is deflationary, but didn't actually argue that. The argument is that QE doesn't do anything if the banks don't take advantage of it and lend more, which is true. While OP gave some anecdotal examples of places in which banks are tightening, this misses the big picture. 

[The velocity of money](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V) remains positive, if diminished from pre-crisis levels. This is a measure of the degree to which high-powered money created by the Fed circulates through the economy. Now, admittedly the velocity of money is getting very low, but the point is that you can safely ignore all warning signs and load up on calls for TSLA. You literally can't lose money. Ever. Come on, man - solar powered robot cars (or whatever)!
Weird way of saying 520
You‚Äôre fine. It has plenty of room to run and has been growing steadily. Stabilizing at each stop on the way up as well. It‚Äôs definitely still a buy under 20.
Where?

I sold $10 covered calls, expiring tomorrow. ü§°
Yes I know I am poor, but why is the PDT rule a thing? Just let me keep my gainzüôÉ
come here retards. here is a strategy.

we already reaped the benefit of selling the put today. With $300 collateral, we reaped $25-to-$45, which is pretty good for 24 hours. 

ITC notice says, the decision is delayed and it will be on for Dec18. Once this initial optimism fades out and reaches to a plateau, we'll buy puts on it this time. I'm guessing Dec 18 $3c is a good entry point. Today it's $.78 per put contract, but it'll be way cheaper tomorrow. We'll buy these and ride it to mid December and then dump it.
Bought some cheap CUBE calls about 10 mins before close because suddenly the C/P was like 195 to .08 on the scanner. 

Anyone here any news ?
Ever heard of an EMP?
Lol what make u say that?
If you knew about nuclear power plants and how safe they are it's fine. If anything goes wrong it's the whole area that's done anyway. Your risk is very low it is good property. Eventually when tech goes even higher that property will be good profit. Multi generational loss for profit in the future. Hope you have kids
GRPO on crazy sale. Stock up big time
VR sickness is improving very quickly. By easing into acceleration and ensuring frame rates remain high, people's experience in a headset is getting much much better.
Were you here in March?
I think skiiing is the safest mass activity there is because you are outside and spaced and probably wear a mask anyway. Unfortunately, the individual counties make the restrictions. Vail will do anything they can to stay open but Summit county, Eagle county, etc. make the call. The ski resort will probably stay open but if the county shuts down short-term rental which they are close to doing, no one will be there to ski. Also, Vail gets a significant portion of their revenue from lodging, food and beverage. That will be close to 0 all season. If Breckenridge ski resort stays open but short term rental and all bars and restaurant are closed, that might be the worst case scenario for Vail Resorts. Their daily operating costs would remain 100%, and their revenue would go down significantly.
Any chance we up tomorrow?

If you have cash waiting to invest and don't want to commit with shares, sell cash secured puts at the money, and close them early if the stock jumps a bit. Use that profit to buy additional shares. If you get assigned for some reason, well you wanted to buy more anyways right?

As of now vail itself is fine. So you could be good! Tomorrow (in Breck) they‚Äôre rolling out 1 household per rental limits. So if you‚Äôre going with friends it would be going against the order.

I live in one of the biggest cities in the country. We have rush hour again. It‚Äôs hard to find parking spaces. The average citizen is, maybe, wearing a mask, but that‚Äôs it.

Invest based on facts, not hype. And the fact is people don‚Äôt really believe the covid scare enough to skip the holidays or lose their jobs.  Again, I‚Äôm Not endorsing, I‚Äôm just observing. And profiting.

If it‚Äôs any consolidation I lost over $10k on BABA calls this month.  And I was watching all day for a chance to  buy back and make some of my money back. It looks like it could go either way. Volume was down a bit which is not necessarily a bad sign, we will have to keep an eye out in the morning to see if this is going to hold... still a long way from breaking any real pivot points but if the momentum carries through tomorrow i see it going 280-290 before the end of the month.

It‚Äôs great news but businesses will still never recover, unemployment is increasing and taxes are going to go through the moon and every business will want to cut costs at every corner and half the workforce is still working from home and the knock on effects of that will be here forever. Buckle up, it‚Äôs going to be a rollercoaster.
So how we looking bro?

I'd like to have that position. You could roll it out and reduce the quantity for net 0 if you are not so confident of over $20 by x'mas. Did you buy these at the high or something, you should be up a bit already after today.

I have a lot of confidence in CRSR. My average is $18 on the 700 shares. If the shares get called away at $45 I'd be okay with it.
DIX spiking to 46.8% would be more meaningful and very bullish if Mnuchin didn‚Äôt cancel the Fed brrrr after hours

wtf was that giant green candle on spy?
Not yet
Cali is the biggest economy in USA and if it locks down we are so fucked
Will probably go up
Did not.
Probably just that Mnuchin is asking the Fed to return the unspent Cares program funds. Less money for the Fed to buy bonds with.
You would look like that too if you see your stock just keep on rocketing to infinity.

Honestly looking at their topline/topline growth and the fact they cant keep products on store shelves, and you could argue they should be valued quite a bit higher than $3.5B. Plus next gen consoles and xmas. More covid/lockdown could be good for them too, more need for streaming shit.

NET has strong foundation with okay valuation compared to the other cloud companies with insane PE. While PLTR and DKNG still have decent run, I‚Äôm not so sure if CRSR can have a sustained run with its current product line.
At least he got 24.24% in boomer stock.
Honestly no, but it‚Äôs a free 3 grand for right now ü§†
It‚Äôs money that was expiring December 31 either way. The funds weren‚Äôt used. Government accounting is strange with appropriations and I don‚Äôt think the request by treasury to have the funds returns is an indication of some grand negative event. Everyone knew that there were excess funds remaining from the CARES programs which weren‚Äôt tapped that‚Äôs why they kept opening the restrictions on who could borrow wider in hopes more business would pull funds.

Go to Theotrade and watch all their free tutorials. 

Then don't do any options trading. At least you'll understand why you shouldn't.
Absolutely, just my opinion. If it was 11/27 I think it would for sure make money. You got 1 day to correct 10%. The momentum EV/green energy has had this week has been a train. I wouldn't be the one to step in front of it. Best of luck to you though! I doubled a NIO 1DTE put last thurs/fri, you might be able to do the same.

Why is it that you recommend trading in the first 30min only ? Also what about the end of the day that usual also has higher volumes no? Should one not buy the day before instead on the first 30 minutes?

this a beyond amazing post so im sure this comment will get buried but if you see this just know the biggest takeaway is that 99.26% of their third quarter net loss was from employee stock compensation. that is all.
Jesus Christ dude. If you‚Äôre balls deep in it then literally take 2 minutes of your life to google the company and basic business finances and see that it‚Äôs massively undervalued. It‚Äôs also less than 2 dollars from your strike with a month left.

Makes sense. Don't tie up more capital than you need to though. Buy it OTM at a level that is easily attainable like 265 1/15/21. If BABA is hasn't been above 270 by Christmas I'll venmo you $100

Rural retards . . . like New York, California, New Jersey, Illinois, and Massachusetts, five of the top seven states for COVID deaths. Or we could do it per capita (even though we were told not to do that when comparing the US to Europe) and you'd have NJ, NY, Mass, and Conn. as the top four. 

Maybe people value other things (mental health, child's education, etc.) more than preventing a disease that is very unlikely to kill them (or even their older relatives). Something can be tragic and not necessitate idiotic responses like "we have to try to save as many lives as possible." We don't say that for anything else.

Yea but if you just buy the Jan 270 calls, it's a somewhat similar trade with actually a higher % payout if it does go to 280. If you buy ITM, it's actually almost the same type of trade except you just have theta decay. I'm probably more bullish on BABA than any stock I trade at this point. It's completely deviated from JD and other Chinese stocks.

Oh yea 100%, they‚Äôve just got to make their way to the UK, which is why I‚Äôm long on NIO and Chinese EVs in general. NIO have already got a base in the UK. Just a matter of time before we shake up the old guards in the auto industry with fresher EV alternatives. The UK are making the right moves but our infrastructure is severely lacking, especially with a lot of households not having realistic access to a wall charger, NIOs battery swapping tech could be a real benefit here

We can't say 100% for sure, but all the indicators so far point to vaccination induced immunity being similarly good or better than catching covid itself. Definitely keep a close eye on continuing trials to see if this holds up, but the immune response looks better than most had hoped for.

These chains can easily borrow to stay afloat. And in the long run, they have inadvertently captured market share and can exploit newfound lack of competition because all the small-fry non-national restaurants got dicked hard and have shut down.

It‚Äôs like betting on your local Walmart during a local economic crisis. Sure no one is buying shit but it will be the only thing open when all the smaller local stores eventually close due to lack of customers and some customers will return when economy is better.

A few months ago I show up to my dad's house and he starts talking about how he should buy a lot he found right on the ocean for 70k.. it's way up in maine but I think ok if it's right on the ocean still not bad. " Limited time one day sale. I should call the number" my dad says... "Where is this listed" I ask him, now very sceptical of the one day sale thing. " It's on FB" he says...

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday sought the return of unused funds from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs emergency lending facilities but the central bank pushed back and said the programs served a vital role.

Mnuchin, in a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, sought a 90-day extension for four of the central bank‚Äôs emergency lending programs, but requested other programs expire on schedule on Dec. 31 and the Fed return $455 billion to the Treasury so Congress can spend the money elsewhere.


‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy,‚Äù the Fed said in a short statement.

Mnuchin is going to redirect those funds into his pockets.

Warrants don‚Äôt have fees for purchasing, the person who replied to you was mentioning ‚Äúunits‚Äù, which are basically a combo-pack of a share and a fractional warrant. You can ask your broker to split the units into their separate parts, or you can just trade the unit for a similar value. 

If you want to just buy warrants though (which are the product of someone already splitting their units, and then selling the warrant), you can purchase them just like a share.
Due to your flair I see that I should safely swerve your advice
Same question. Is it to late?

**Model Y reliability woes put Tesla near bottom of Consumer Reports rating**

Consumer Reports gave the Tesla Model Y SUV a "not recommended" rating because of significant reliability problems, dragging the brand to near the bottom of the [magazine's industry-wide reliability ranking](https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2020/11/consumer-reports-identifies-mix-of-new-suvs-cars-trucks-that-are-dependable/).

The Model Y, the carmaker's newest model which [began production](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/04/business/tesla-model-y/index.html) at the start of this year, is expected to become [Tesla's best-selling vehicle](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/business/tesla-model-y-elon-musk/index.html). It got good ratings overall from Consumer Reports' staff during test drives earlier this year. But the reliability rankings are based on a survey of actual owners -- who reported significant problems. "A car might be great to drive and have all the features you want," said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, "but all that won't matter to you much if you have to keep going back to the dealer for repairs. "The problems with the Model Y ranged from misaligned body panels to mismatched paint. One owner reported dust, debris, and even human hair stuck in the paint. 

 Fisher said new vehicles often have reliability problems but Tesla's issues are unusually bad.

"It's some basic stuff they're not getting right, which is disappointing," he said. "It's disappointing that body panels are not aligned so they can't even shut the back hatch. It's disappointing the paint has so many problems. You'd think this is stuff they would be able to get right from the start."  
Tesla ([TSLA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&source=story_quote_link)) did not respond to a request for comment on the Consumer Reports rating.  
The Tesla Model S luxury sedan also dropped to "below average" reliability and is no longer recommended by Consumer Reports. The Model X kept its previous "not recommended" rating due to continued reliability issues**.**  
Only Tesla's Model 3 sedan, currently the company's best selling model, received a recommended rating from Consumer Reports.  
The problems with the Model Y dragged down Tesla's overall ranking two spots, to second from the bottom among all 26 ranked auto brands. Now it is ahead of only Ford's luxury Lincoln brand, and just behind Volkswagen, which finished last in 2019.  
"If the Model Y had similar reliability to the Model 3, Tesla would be mid-pack, it wouldn't be among the worst," Fisher said.  
Tesla also has received poor reliability ratings from [JD Power](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/cars/tesla-jdpower-rankings/index.html).  
Consumer Reports staff has often praised Teslas in their reviews separate from the reliability issues. The Model S achieved the [best score ever](https://money.cnn.com/2013/05/09/autos/tesla-model-s-consumer-reports/index.html) for a vehicle reviewed by the staff.  
The disconnect between the strong review of the Tesla vehicles by staff and the poor reliability ratings from its survey of owners has been a continuing challenge for the company.  
"This isn't our judgment, it's \[the\] judgment of Tesla owners," said Fisher. "If the reliability improved, I would be very happy to recommend Teslas. They're satisfying and really fun to drive. They're good for the environment. We hope our feedback helps them improve these problems."  
Tesla customers remain incredibly loyal to the brand, despite the issues raised in the survey. "The exact same people who tell us they love their Tesla are telling us about the problems with their cars," Fisher said.

Tesla wasn't the only carmaker with reliability concerns. Lincoln was hurt by issues with its new Aviator and Corsair SUVs.

And the new version of the [Ford Explorer](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/12/business/ford-explorer-recall/index.html) SUV also suffered from serious reliability problems that made it one of the lowest scoring models from any manufacturer‚Äîdomestic or foreign‚Äîthis year.

Owners of the Explorer reported numerous transmission replacements, along with problems affecting the SUV's drive system, in-car electronics, power equipment and engine and body hardware problems.

The least reliable vehicles according to the ranking were the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and its GMC version, the Sierra. The Toyota Prius was the most reliable.

Toyota lost its ranking as the most reliable brand as Mazda captured the top spot for the first time.

Every day is different, if there was a specific and consistent pattern, the people would adjust their behavior and the pattern would no longer exist. 

The only pattern that is relatively consistent, is inflated prices AH or PM on ‚Äúhot‚Äù SPACs and warrants. Prices then fall when volume picks up surfing trading hours. This doesn‚Äôt always happen though, since sometimes the stocks rise based on normal market buying and you don‚Äôt get a dip.

Good luck!

The thing is, Norway is a rich country and they have a ton of government subsidies and perks for driving electric cars. It‚Äôs easy to sell to Norway. The UK on the other hand are atrocious and considering most people here either drive a city super mini or a crossover/fake SUV, there are none currently that can realistically fit the bill for the majority of the population in terms of price to performance. I‚Äôd say 80% of people buy their cars used from anywhere between 5000-30k with the Model 3 coming in close to 40k starting

It‚Äôs a stock, it doesn‚Äôt have an expiration date.
I got burned yesterday for being a pussy and missed out on some real nice gains.  Today I decided to not be a pussy and diamond handed my options and got burned.  Pretty much blew up the last of my account.  However, I sold my SPX puts that expire in the a.m. during AH because the puts would not print unless the S&P opened below 3,510.  It also ensures I have some cash for tomorrow since my cash deposit won‚Äôt be available until next week.  That kind of drop overnight just seemed really unlikely, but then the S&P continued to drop AH.  I‚Äôm going to lose my fucking shit if it opens at or below 3,500.
Even with some assumed dips, BABA 1/15 calls should print, no? I can finally afford some nice options, so highly considering it some ITM calls.

Trade only during the first 30mins after market open. Take your profits (if any), set a stop loss to prevent this.
Always read your chart, rsi, bullish/bearish div and volume before taking a position. That way you‚Äôll prevent this in the future. Also don‚Äôt buy same week, buy at least 2-3 weeks away to avoid theta burn give and chance to recover (if u don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing)and it dips.

Yeah but the Model Y, as you said, is ugly as fuck, and the Model S does 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds, which the Y can't. The tech aspect is pretty negligible imho.
Now that it's clear that's where the future is going, there's going to be a huge market incentive for every corporation to get there first and claim market share. Whether it's for vehicles or for charging stations. Companies see the writing on the wall and they don't want to be left behind.

Hey man I'm currently a bear as well. I have spy 290 marchs. Let's get this bread.
Unless Tesla is paying a ton to use those I don't think China would go for it. There isn't any competition between Tesla and the Chinese EV currently, but once that starts they don't want Tesla using their distribution channels.
Yes it helps me understand names that move together/move independently from each other. Obviously, all names have some correlation to SPY too, but if we get rid of the SPY beta, it's nice to know say PTON/ZM/CRWD/CHGG/DOCU/ZS/TDOC (and like 30 other names with Amazon being like on the edge of these 30 since it's not as strongly correlated with it also being big tech) all belong in the "stay at home" basket. 

It helps say you know ZM has earnings coming up. You might be able to get a much cheaper IV call on say CRWD knowing if ZM moons, CRWD will too. This helped last time but MM probably will catch on this time so I'm expecting really high IVs across the board this time around. But like overall it's more useful for hedging and making sure my pnl is fairly balanced and doesn't have wild swings because I'm so overleverged one sector which all move together.
Honestly think you‚Äôre fucked lol, good luck though

The problem is, if that's the most compelling reason you have to buy a stock.. you can't think much of it in the first place?

You can surely find better reasons to buy a stock? The number of investors who wouldn't buy because the price is too high would be a rounding error, insignificant.
Same someone explain
Probably not, but I have a policy of not fomoing back into former plays if I escaped with a good profit. It would be hard to stomach giving it all back.

So Google pays Apple, and as a response, Apple is going to expend more of its capital and cut out Google so a double whammy. 

Not saying it's inconceivable if they feel they can corner more of the market on security (that being said it's damn near impossible to avoid Amazon, Google, Msft, and FB on the back end) but there is some intense calculations to dedicate to that. The data they could extract does have some value, but would be self defeating if they're selling it instead of Google. 

You probably would see DuckDuckGo as an acquisition target prior to dumping google. 

Again, I don't understand the machinations that would propt this decision unless Google is about to get raided on a couple fronts and Apple wants to isolate themselves.
Like far down though

Your position size is wayyyy to big if you get upset about losing. Losing is part of this game. You'll never be  a good trader if you can't stomach losses.

But if you are at this point that you describe you need to seriously deleverage yourself and stop yoloing. Play it safe again until you build up some confidence. It sounds like your death rolling to see if something sticks. That's bad  you'll blow out your account

That is the definition of a crash. A crash doesn't mean the end of capitalism or the world, you millennial moron. A dip is just a correction.
How stupid and a novice can you be calling 08 a dip? Indicies falling by 50% or more, and prices of individual stocks crashing by 90% or companies going BK, like two historic IBs such as Lehman and Bears, both which survived the Great Depression, is not a little dip.

Made like 45 percent gains on baba calls, lost 30 percent of a smaller position on ccl puts. Decided to ban myself from Robin Hood and tried to 1dte trade tsla and spy. Ended the day down a few hundred bucks, moved to ToS, bought the AH dip on CIIC. Man I belong here

Answer is yes, and so what.  Just be prepared to actively manage it so you don‚Äôt get caught in the next rug pull
What‚Äôs happening ?
This is how earnings go anymore.

Great earnings come out -> Stock is bought up.

Call happens that give the gory details -> Stock sold.

Investors mull on the complete report and implications -> ????

The week following earnings seems to be more telling about how investors feel about it. I've seen plenty of companies beat well on earnings, sell of the next day or two, and then build up over the follow week.

If you're goin to play earnings, especially a Thursday PM one, I'd buy options with expiries 1-2 weeks later.

Huh? Look at the chart. NIO does not drop every Friday. This is the 2nd time I've seen someone say this, and you can look at the chart. IT DOES NOT drop by a meaningful percentage.
Seatbelts are for bears
Thanks buck. Disagree again, but I'll see you Sunday!
You know the bears are severely traumatized by the massive green cock November when they're gloating over SPY -0.40% AH. Yikes!

That's the only thing the govt has to prevent panic now. They are already slated for news every 1-2 weeks. PFE and MRNA said they will release more data dec 1-8. JNJ said by second week of dec. AZN said before end of dec. RGEN said will release study or something before the end of year.
That‚Äôs why you should. He‚Äôs one of us.
Does this mean you‚Äôre missing like two?

People are misunderstanding the use case. It‚Äôs a second car for tech yuppies, a short distance delivery vehicle and a ride for single person day trips so you can park in fucked, dense urban environments like SFO or NYC. 

Europeans will also be all over this thing. 

It‚Äôs a very specific niche and use case - it‚Äôs moat is that Tesla and others won‚Äôt even bother trying to crush them because it‚Äôs not worth the trouble. 

I‚Äôm still not sure I‚Äôd buy it over 10 bucks - but I regret selling my 2.40 shares for 4.40 right now. I was anticipating a dip and that never materialized.
Dead wrong. Have you seen the Fed balance sheet? CARE‚Äôs act renewal is priced in. The mango admin has given J POW every $ request. This is a Mango tantrum to burn the place down. It‚Äôs not catastrophic news, but a few MM‚Äôs pulling back in this fragile Enviornmental and sht could get bad fast.
I hope not...the volume was still there today
Wild-ass speculation.

Gotta be Trump people. Call me crazy but that seems like an absolute joke of a possibility. Biden isn‚Äôt even remotely that left wing. The only people who seem to think he is are hardcore conservatives.

I've thought it was too late on CRSR a few times all the way up to where it is now. I decided I'd just set a daily recurring investment into it on robinhood. I know it's boring stonks but at least I'll get money into something that'll likely go up longer term since I've been terrible at timing entries into CRSR

You have to read my post again to understand what I said. I mentioned BA wasn't in IWM. It's all about the correlations, not what's actually in which index. I only brought BA because it's one of the few non-tech names that could have liquid AH volume.

Plus it's way too early. Futures haven't even opened. You could see some jumps around 6 in AH SPY either direction.
ooo those name drops

Bro if you have 100 shares of anything why aren‚Äôt you selling CCs? Sell far OTM if you don‚Äôt wanna be assigned. You might only make a few bucks, but isn‚Äôt that better than not making a few bucks?
They all lost their savings already
I‚Äôve been lucky the past two years not afraid of tomorrow lol
This. There is a volume of 40M shares traded today. No fucking way this is retail. It's jumping up in AH/PM not as much during the day. This is MM playing with this for some reason, probably a glitch in the algo.
You can get a whole new set of bags to hold!!!!
Did you write this like a retard to illustrate the point?
You should sell while you're ahead. Their market cap is only 700M and the stock is at $10. That's giga inflated. NIO is almost 1:1 for stock price and market cap ($ to bil). I can't see it rallying for much longer before a big crash

So yeah prob
Yes I mentioned correlation to IWM. Like airlines/BA correlate more to IWM than MSFT (which I know you have a lot of üòÇ). I know no IWM name is actually in SPY but many names correlate to IWM more than to QQQ within SPY. 

I actually have a matrix for this so I can understand rotations better for trading. It's been somewhat helpful for trading although we both need MSFT to go back up.

The Fed‚Äôs cor¬≠po¬≠rate credit, mu¬≠nic¬≠i¬≠pal lend¬≠ing and Main Street Lend¬≠ing pro¬≠grams won‚Äôt be re¬≠newed, Mr. Mnuchin said Thurs¬≠day.

Fed¬≠eral Re¬≠serve Chair¬≠man Jerome Pow¬≠ell had in¬≠di¬≠cated in re¬≠marks Tues¬≠day that he didn‚Äôt think it would be ap¬≠pro¬≠pri¬≠ate to al¬≠low the pro¬≠grams to ex¬≠pire.

‚ÄúThe Fed will be strongly com¬≠mit¬≠ted to us¬≠ing all of our tools to sup¬≠port the econ¬≠omy for as long as it takes un¬≠til the job is well and truly done,‚Äù Mr. Pow¬≠ell said. ‚ÄúWhen the right time comes, and I don‚Äôt think that time is yet or very soon, we will put those tools away,‚Äù he said.
This is the way

Not necessarily you will have ups and downs and have to manage your positions still. When stock prices go up you could lose out. Buy and hold could do better but who knows. Sometimes you just have to get lucky

Calls on $MOM
I lost out timing the market in march. Sold my port on March 18th (I think March 20th was the literal bottom) and it will bother me way too much forever. What helps is I made a bunch on puts on the way down but never made that turn. I‚Äôm more or less a perma bull for life and will never sell my whole port again lol

The lessons you learn losing out on gains
What'd he say?
lmao.

I bought a December 18 Solo 9 strike put when it was at $8.30 for 2.4.

I sold the 9 put when it was at $9.70 for 2.2

The put didn't buy the fact that Solo was rising.
Lol all the limit down and rug pull talk makes my SPY calls so happy to see around here
Seems Trump is ready to concede. Can't let this fake fed charade run on and give Biden the greatest economy in the world, which he built twice. /s

Fauci about to pump this shit
First of all, that's 100% false and sounds like some Facebook spam bullshit. Reagan started a war, Bush 1 started a war, and Bush 2 started a war.

John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama¬†did not.



Second of all, it's weird af to claim people are hypocrites simply because Trump didn't start a war, as if they had argued that he did. Doesn't even make any sense.
What does this mean
They probably have moved the same % as SPY AH (see like a BA, JPM, etc.). Most of the other hard hit COVID stocks don't have meaningful AH volume since spreads are so wide no one will really trade.
Saw it on WSJ
11/20 I SEE U MMS 

WELL PLAYED
would anyone here actually take a vaccine
Holding 1/21/22 3C , see you in a year
Because Feb/March is me going off of his '2 months tops' comment. If it's at the tail end of that 2 months, he's already blown through his shitty SPY350 calls. See my point? His positions don't line up with his words. 

If I think the market dies within 2 months, why the fuck am I going to buy puts 1 month out, when MY OWN DD says it could float on another month?
everyone keeps saying Mnuchin fucked everything but I wouldn't know since all of my cash is in PLTR and nothing stops the fuckin PLTR train, not even Mnuchin.

I made some off it when it was $10 but got back in a lot more when it was $17 and controlling 3k worth of shares.

If I went in shares at $18 I would net 344% if it hits $80 a share but if I went with Jan 2023 $10 calls I would hit roughly 483% so I went with the leaps instead.

I got 11/20 350s ü§û
Yes it is. The "correlated" small cap names that are in SPY but not IWM. Like a BA probably has moved down more than AAPL/MSFT AH and I don't need to look. Yes BA is not a small cap name but it correlates to IWM/DIA more than QQQ.
PFE AND MRNA are the ones to be in right now. Mango will absolutely push to get these 2 approved before his term is up.

There might be a reason for that, and it's still not even that cheap.  $180 or so, for TSLA to move 60% in 3 weeks.  You could have just bought 180 lottery tickets and have better odds.
PFE, MRNA, JNJ, RGEN, AZN.... BUY CALLS TOMORROW. Going to be a rotation of vaccine/therapeutics pumps over the next 4-8 weeks.

Anything it takes to achieve mod status üò™
How so?
I think it's a little bit more of a long play than some might think.  Q3 earnings come out in December and they might disappoint there.  The Q4 earnings which will include the new consoles and the bulk of Christmas spending won't be out until next year.
I think it‚Äôs a solid play. FCEL pumps about once a month, dips to shake, trades flat, then pumps out of nowhere again. It inexplicably dies around ER like clockwork, but you‚Äôll be a month early for that. Still, first red dildo you see with volume make sure you cut those or at the very least sell puts above your cost for credit spread.
No one cares what either of those guys have to say
PLTR is just getting started. ü§ëüìà

This sub is actually surprisingly informative. It might have mitigated the severity of the crash.
The liquid tech stocks which are the only stocks that really have meaningful AH volume barely have moved (why QQQ isn't falling off a cliff). The entire SPY AH move is from small caps/correlated names + the hard hit COVID stocks (see the way IWM is falling vs QQQ).

For real though, fucking relieved. Accounting Theta, I expect that at minimum I'll be breaking even. In which case, I'll have to gamble something else before the New Year.

If you're so confident it's gonna blow up, just skip the second round and buy Feb/March puts now for tech/SPY and sell 2/3 months dated calls.

The stock market is going to be there as long as you are alive. Don‚Äôt sweat one bad trade. Learn from it. For instance, I learned early to buy all calls in multiple of 2. That way if I feel a dump or anything I can always take out half my money for profit but leave the other and set a stop loss. This way I can always walk with profit.

He does make good money, but if i'm so confident that the market dies within 2 months, I'm selling calls, and loading up on Feb/March puts for every tech company on the planet, SPY, and companies with shitty financials. 

I'm not buying SPY 350 puts at 1 month expiry. That tells me he's leaving a lot of room for error that he either knows about, or worse, doesn't know about and knows he's retarded.

pointless yea...I just don't see AMZN getting to like $5000 since I've never seen that happen before...yet they are that capable of a company...feels like people would buy in more at a lower price.
I mean there is unprecedented money printing in the US. Very little inflation. Same with BOJ in the past. I think printing money into the real economy would be much more inflationary that's not really what the fed is doing.

Look at the SPY chart.  I mean just look at it.  You think it's going to blow past all time highs based on stimulus hopes that now as ever have no chance of passing until mid January at least?  Worst Covid levels yet and lock downs resuming.  

At the very least you'd say we're going sideways, but definitely not up.
Yes. Big red
Yeah market will still be there without you dude.  Just sell all the things and take a week or two off to help clear your head and remember what life is.  You‚Äôll perform better when you come back too.
I like the ideas. But I think we squeeze a bit more. Timeline is a bit too short imo. Also macro outlook depends on inflation expectations or not.

Not talking about FNMA.  I'm talking about the investment banks that actually buy in these loan originations.

This has been all over the news.  Not sure how you could possibly miss it.

JPM has raised from 620 FICO and 5% down to 700 FICO and 20% down.  If you want to refinance a jumbo, Wells wants you to have a $1m balance, up from $250k, and they cut LTV on loans by 5%.

These are just two examples.

Think buying calls hoping for Pfizer vaccine emergency approval in the next two weeks is a bad play? They're submitting a request tomorrow. Last time they had vaccine news they mooned to $42. 11/27 40c are like $0.08 and 12/4 are like $0.80. I'm trying to find out how long the turn around for approval is.

i hope you enjoy KILLING GRANDMA you sick fuck.

I had some mexican at a restaurant last night but I'm in texas all the grandmas are dead already
Of course. But that's a tall order. I meant more washing hands etc will reduce seasonal cold, flu and gastro illnesses which reduces primary care/hospital visits which then reduces health expenditures. Of course insurance companies will pocket that difference. Even the aca 90/10 rule can be avoided by "spending".
The $1 or so AH movement on Spy didn't help clue you in yet either?

60-80 would be bold in 3-4 months but not impossible. I'm hoping for 100 dollars per share by the end of 2021.
Appreciate the input, my calls went up a nice chunk today so maybe I'll roll them out further. Still confident on those June calls though, especially with their incoming increase in mining production H1 '21. Listening to CNBC talk about coin is cringe, they think it has to operate like a stock and fill in gaps but ignore the underlying drivers that will continue to force the price higher. Mining costs are high, and many miners are in China and are forced to constantly sell in order to cover their costs, so there's a hard floor on how low it can go and no real upper limit as public adoption continues to increase.
I love how people think drawing a line between two points is a trend.
I support this

It's because bulls talked endless shit when there was a little fake stimmy pump, so now they feel embarrassed that it sold off like 30 seconds after close, right after they loaded up on calls.
Oh fuck my bad. Carry on.
I sold my 11/20 7.5c this morning once it broke even. Shit fucking flew after that wish I stayed in. Still got some 12/18 10c and shares that made me a good bit today though.

Sold when i saw that 115k wall at 50.00. Looks like it‚Äôs gone though, could see 52 ish tomorrow. I did pretty well on dkng calls this week tho. Ez money.

Not worried at all over tiny AH volume. Really gonna do my best this time around to sit on my shares long term. I'm 26 and looking back it will be so obvious that I should be buying EV stocks right now.

Also in on BIK before their merger is officially announced. Search BIK on twitter for some news on that.
Yeah, I'm thinking that there will be more and more hype around PSTH as it closes the year, as everyone gets anxious for Bill's announcement. 

Do you know if Robinhood supports warrants? I went with options also because I didn't even know if RH would give me warrants.

Again, sold when it dropped after earnings, as it was ONLY an earnings play. Any idiot could check the charts and see they were going to tank during early trading. 

I still think the company is trash. If you made profit going long, good for you. I made profit shorting. Who gives a fuck.
Ah. Cool for those who got in on the ground floor.

XPEV market cap is already on par with Ford though.

With that in mind, I definitely already don't have enough confidence in the company to put my money on it.
‚ÄòPreciate that, bro. It was quite a saga full of heartache and pain but I prevailed in the end. My retarded ass bought back in (way smaller and actually lower than I sold her) later in the day. I love the pain.

Liquidity is pretty bad on SPXS options, and being leveraged sends up the IV, which minimizes gains.

I've had both in my portfolio at the same time, and SPY puts always print more bigly.

That said, if you're doing it specifically because the underlying is cheaper and that's part of your strategy, then fair enough.
Enjoy your new car/house/boat if that happens. It's possible given the new excitement in the ticker
Man, I am so jealous of you guys. I Had a huge load of February 20c when it was trading at $18 and I sold after earnings at $27. Was only going to sell half but went for it all. Made good gains, but still salty. Was not expecting this type run. Congrats.

If price moves up you can close out your original at a loss and roll up while making largely passive income that reduces your overall cost basis.  If you plan to be holding the stock anyway it's just a little side-hustle

From my understanding (and I‚Äôm retarded) historically any company that gets put into S&P shoots up in price but when it‚Äôs officially in it usually just goes back to its original price. So I‚Äôd watch out for the spike, which looks like it‚Äôs getting there now, and sell at the top obviously.

I'm getting in on CIIC and BIK before the mergers. Both are commercial EVs that already have contracts with big companies like UPS and Amazon respectively. I could imagine a scenario where they become the go-to commercial EV producers. Everyday EVs will be huge but the market is going to be flooded with new makers and current auto companies pivoting.

I disagree, but I want to know why you think that. I keep SPXS calls as hedges because the underlying is cheap enough to where if the dump seems to be continuing I can exercise all of them  and continue to ride the fall without buying back into a new position. That strat worked out pretty well for me in Octobear, VXX puts then became my hedge. Why do you think spy puts are better than spxs calls?

I spent all day trading that TSLA stock with the 497-501 tight range and it was stressful af
Who reads that rag anymore?
This is the guy I will tell my grand children about.
I‚Äôm buying EV stocks that won‚Äôt surprise me with -50% losses one morning. Ones that actually make cars that people want to buy (like NIO and TSLA)
It just seems clunky to me. And probly on purpose cause i can see there is waay more info available. Im just rtarded tho, bitching into the ether. I will lose money wherever, i just wamt to learn the ins and outs of the platform. Ur right tho rh is so simplistic compared to td
This guy looks exactly what I think all of you look like.
You right. I was wrong.

Stimmy pump didn't sell off tomorrow. It sold off like 30 seconds after close.

How do u even do it.
Hmm maybe I should have bought the dip
This is the way..

i had that wsb tunnel vision on pltr and tsla missed all the huge ones today fk
Hmmm. True.
If this is going to be comparable to the dotcom bubble we have way more mooning to do and the crash will terrible.
I put a shitload into PLTR, might 11/27 $60 yolo a bit in nio
I feel it, at one point today was up 5K on my TSLA calls, ended the day at +500.
I dont even know man im feeling drained. Since friday the 13 ive been starring at my screen like a crack head. I feel like stocks is taking over my life. I need help üòî
I wonder if they have stock help line
Yolo
I went shares and the warrants were a definite upside.  


However I'm looking at options profit calc now and those June 30 calls print better if we see psth above 30 by mid March.  So it really is a toss up.


I am definitely going to have both in the future.  Right now my current average cost of stocks is right around 23.
Nice play I think it happens tomorrow
I believe there is real potential with Momentus and Virgin Galactic. I‚Äôve been trying to research into as much as I can and the company is pursing a space tug service that has little competition. SpaceX is lowering the cost of space travel and more demand is being created in space. This will create an opportunity for Momentus. There are lot of factors that can explain this rapid development in space technology.

The SPAC will provide them with more than 300 million and contracts with satellite companies keep coming in.

I try to cover this more at r/SpaceStockExchange and in this video: https://youtu.be/TraXbhS-GOs
Only for the smooth brains
I doubt EVs will drop any time soon. It wont be until people realize theyre not special, which will take many years.

It had good PR and decent earnings. Had low market cap before it tripled this week and has a bunch of pre-orders (though the pre-orders are relatively low commitment). 

Basically, it‚Äôs a gamble and people are hoping it‚Äôll actually be worth a billy once it starts shipping and are piling on.
If you were up 25% in a day (which is a lot) it probably means you're taking far too much risk. You could just as easily be down 25%

Try to come up with a good risk management plan, and learn to take profits

Just remember opportunities will always come and go. Take profit frequently and even if it runs up more after you cash out just don‚Äôt worry about it. Also be patient if you have far out expiration dates, a lot can change in just one week.

244k were watching Jiuliani talk about the cases they are about to file on RSBN on youtube

But we are to believe Biden had 80 million votes.

Markets are going to skyrocket once these cases get heard in court. Hell if Nancy loses the Congress we will get stimulus and it will be targeted to people instead of kickbacks to states.

I sold all my Tesla at $500 cause fucking fundamentals. Average purchase price was $269.
You heard it from Biden just now, the concern with vaccines is the logistics and getting them to the most vulnerable. This is where PLTR is going to strike and become a mainstream tech titan for the foreseeable future. Get in now, you will never see a sub 20 dollar Palantir stock ever again past this week.

Here is what people don‚Äôt understand. Yes, the market is overvalued but the amount of traders has seen a surge because people quarantining have literally nothing to do. So instead of buying shit with their money they‚Äôre throwing it into stocks. As long as quarantine persists, so will that influx of traders and cash. I am a bear so timing this is difficult but i believe we will not see a large crash until AFTER quarantine when these new traders decide to either forget about stocks and go back to work or cash out.
EVs are definitely making a bubble right now. I still think there is a lot more up to go before any crashing happens though.

You heard it from Biden just now, the concern with vaccines is the logistics and getting them to the most vulnerable.

NIO is definitely going up past what it‚Äôs at but it might go down at any given moment...like if one country bombs another...you never know. If you need the money, which you clearly do since you only bought 1 contract, then just take your wins and walk away from the table. The longer you stay the more likely you are to lose it.

The fact that the market hasn't dropped yet but in fact has made all-time highs has me thinking this is bigger than a market crash.  This could be the end of our financial system as we know it, there's no way back to sanity from here.   But it will most likely be a drawn out process.  Markets are useless right now, and the money made will probably be useless too.

List of the oldest publicly traded companies in the US:

Only two were publicly listed prior to 1871. 

Investments in 1871 are more than likely worthless today unless they were in $ED or $BK. Keep in mind the first index fund didn‚Äôt exist until 1967, so again, worthless.

Bro S&P Global fucked up bigtime with their Tesla announcement. Normally they announce an S&P500 inclusion and it‚Äôs the next week. So in a week 1 stock out 1 stock in. They gave Tesla 5 weeks and haven‚Äôt announced who‚Äôs getting dumped.

So instead of tomorrow being the last day of the pump and Monday being back to normal, we have until December 21st to pump the shit out of it.

Indexers will need to buy shares but they can‚Äôt buy until very close to the 21st or they risk not tracking the index. TLDR buy now sell before the 21st & stop bitching about being wrong. Take it to r/investing.

Reserves are money. Yes, they can‚Äôt be lent directly, but they free cash to be lent. Cash is fungible. 

And the massive reduction we‚Äôve seen in consumer debt, especially short term, may look deflationary to a Keynesian, but it means the average American is far more financially secure, and is looking to invest rather than paying 15-30% monthly on their credit cards. 

Your best point is about unemployment, but from an economic standpoint most of the lost jobs in retail and services don‚Äôt have much impact on the overall economy. They were mostly folks who got paid pennies to produce minor luxuries nobody needed. I feel for them, but that‚Äôs not even Main Street, let alone Wall Street. A lot of small business died, but that‚Äôs fairly common, and more have adapted and are coming back strong. 

Another shutdown might change things, but without one we‚Äôre headed for one heck of a Santa Clause rally. 

And we‚Äôre not shutting down again. No one really believes COVID is that dangerous except to sick old people, who don‚Äôt produce economically anyway. Even the media and politicians beating the panic drums the hardest take of their masks in private, or for riots, or to celebrate Biden, or for fundraisers... NO ONE actually believes the hype. Which is maybe dumb, but it means we‚Äôre not shutting down. The left is just hoping to keep people scared enough to justify a massive pork barrel ‚Äúcovid stimulus‚Äù in late January to bail out their favorite special interests.
I read somewhere a lot of patients don‚Äôt acknowledge it until their last day on earth. Sad

Just sitting here watching the stars go by as i head towards the moon, in my dumpy 3 wheeler piece of shit
Idk man they have been working well lately
Im jealous üò£üò£üò£
I got a nice little 44% return off PLTR, I shared a screenshot with my father who‚Äôs been investing for a while now. 

‚ÄòI‚Äôve never gotten a 20% return, be proud‚Äô 

And for once in my life, I had my fathers approval
Sleepy Joe. He's also trying to talk shit about mango. Mango gonna come in with some heat tonight on twitter.
Not retail investors tho. Lol. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
WHAT IS SPY DOING
Nobody tell him.
I meant if you're a bear 8 out of 10 times and don't have puts but do the other two when shit happens then it's fine.
TSLA 515c & 520c 11/27

Bought them at the low this morning, and, uhhhhhhh, didn't sell ;|
Do they have a ROKU app yet?

How a company makes a streaming platform and isn't compatible with 70% of streaming devices I'll never know....

I'm not going to buy an inferior streaming device or play it on my laptop and stream to my TV like some kind of nerd.
I‚Äôd agree, target the lockdowns at specific cities and areas
I say flat
They might even be correct about the market being overvalued. They probably are correct but it just doesn‚Äôt matter if you go bankrupt before it corrects.
It‚Äôs RUINED. Bro I have spxs call but chill
i had 3k in  after market yesterday and sold this morn at 17.5, thought getting back in with an avg of 16.9 wasnt bad, but damn was i wrong and my 500 shares hurting lol, could be worse...thinknig about getting more, just such a good company, just nervous because its all so new, and they dont even have products yet... but i just can shake the feeling that this shit will perform like nio and them
Apple to 135 by end of month please
Not sure.
Bears r fuk!!!!
I swear Biden looks older every time you see him
Biden: there will be no national lock down.

IWM to 500.
[removed]
He said no universal national shutdown but pretty much said we would need to shutdown strategically in places that have rising cases
[removed]
CRSR is rocketing in the after market!
lol true
Need to get a bit lucky on WDAY. Short calls at 250 with 1 day left. Even with it being up AH, if it ends like here tomorrow, I'll still be good.
No national shutdown he‚Äôs just going to establish criteria for states to follow and let them shut themselves down as needed

Anyone thinking massive lockdowns aren‚Äôt coming is just not paying attention to the case and death numbers
Of course BABA moons the day before payday smh. Under $260 is an ideal entry point
Whats the next NNDM? Best play ever
Anyone who doubts NIO is a fucking retard. 10 whole minutes of research could tell you why they are going to hit 200 next year or more
Will the next big pump be when trump concedes?
Media was making it sound like one *might* be coming.
Probably blew up his account and gone
No National shutdown? Thanks joe. Gonna do wonders for my stay at home ‚Äòfolio

100%. Funny to see every core company be flat or mildly selling today. Also all these EV‚Äôs have monthly options. Wonder what will happen when brokers don‚Äôt need to hold the shares past tomorrow to protect against the option lol.
What‚Äôs Tesla doing tomorrow?
I think I stole the PSXP 6/18 $35 calls today at .90. Bought some previously at 1.1.  The spread was wide so took a shot and got filled. 

Going to be great for long haul I think
Hmm logic would say the absolute mountain of puts I have been buying would print,  but we all know how this market works with logic
FUV. Up 69% today with room to run
Up
That was me
What if MM artificially kept the market high today to buy back as many puts as they could in anticipation of a massive drop tomorrow?
Some thoughts 

1. Credit will have trouble expanding if debt is being refinanced. The act of refinancing destroys credit.

2. A large part of the upward movement in stocks is due to the death of the corporate debt market. The market turned March 23rd after the fed had stepped in to backstop corporate debt.
Anyone save the positions he took? I'm interested to know how it turned out.
well i did say i was retarded
It‚Äôs running like crazy in AH
Fuck no.

I did the exact same switch from Robinhood to TDAmeritrade in 03/2020 when the markets were crashing and Robinhood kept having insane server issues. Fuck em. TDA covered the $75 fee. Never looking back even if TDA charges like $0.65(?) per option trade.

Real question is how much we loosed
It‚Äôs probly gonna keep running for a bit
AH is fun to watch! Been swinging 2% each way. 

I fucked up with SOLO and bought in the low 2s and sold in the low 4s. Worried about doing the same thing here. 

Regardless - hope you pocketed some cash from them today and god speed in the morning!
I‚Äôm in on the bangbus.

From Nikola's 10-Q:

As a result, approximately 161 million shares of our common stock will become eligible for sale beginning on December 1, 2020 upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above. Approximately 5 million additional shares of our common stock held by the Original Holders may become eligible for sale beginning on or after December 1, 2020 pursuant to the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, depending on the price of our common stock during the 30-trading day period commencing on or after November 1, 2020 at the time.

When that amount of shares are unleashed onto the market, seas of red will follow...
Probably because I‚Äôm a greedy unappreciative piece of capitalist shit.
Nvidia tends to falls after earnings . Sometimes the move is to not play the game, let IV do its thing and swoop in afterwards . Learned it the hard way last quarter .
Yeah i know. I have like actual anxiety now after losing all my money but I also made like $7k last month purely swing trading shares before I moved to options so maybe I am a genius and just on the brink of learning options...

yeah, maybe tech calls and stay at home are the play

i'll think about my spy puts again tomorrow morning... i did well today

daily chart looks very bearish for SPY and things are worse now than they were the past 2 months -- we were up and down a few times now

the restart of stimulus talks makes me wonder
You're right its not just about the EV, with TSLA and NIO you're also investing in their AI and GPS systems. GM and Ford are only alive thanks to bailouts, I don't see them developing their own AI...one that works anyway.
I feel as if I may have had a stroke watching this?

Yea tried playing puts when it works it really pays off only problem is knowing when to lock in gains. Learned my lesson switched to calls and have been green 2 days in a row now. Bought the SPY dip today and already up 67%
Sold my 5/21 PLTR 10c's and exchanged them for 5/21 PLTR 30c's. 

Every roulette player knows; when you hit your number let it ride!!!

Just bc of u spy 370 eod
It‚Äôs like $600 of lotto tickets. This is what happened Tuesday. Though we‚Äôd get a squeeze, it consolidated. Squeezed yesterday...consolidated today...we squeeze tomorrow I‚Äôm makin fuckin bank üòÇ if not. I‚Äôm out $600. Whatever I made 3k on fcel the last 2 days.
SOLO long puts?
you could try a a bank that offers investment services, look up the ones in your country and see what they offer.
Thx bby!
I‚Äôm always worried on jumping in too late. It only started pumping today but I‚Äôm always a bit worried with these ones...

Seems like a shady person, but they weren‚Äôt wrong yet.
NIO hype
So some time tonight we should get a decision?
no it isnt, its also the lowest fakest volume ive ever seen. glad i was looking at order charts before close to see all the institutional orders at 17... thousands of shares traded for in last minute, the volume weve had after hrs equates to 1/5 of the volume there was in the last minute with orders at 17... call me retarded, cuz i am, but i think this shit opens green!

Misread the question. Sounds like a gift. That's not taxable but any gift over $30k has to get reported. Those shares would get stepped up basis but only with an inheritance.

Bottom line you would still have to pay taxes on p/l based on shares unless they're an inheritance.

Bought on the dip up 67% and will continue to climb tomorrow. I believe a dip will happen in near future but not before we retest highs first. Similar to last Thursday when we dipped hard and all the bears celebrated only to be back over $360 to days later.

Are you the youtube steve van metre? Love your shows but sometimes I think you are plain wrong. 

But on this analysis you are right. The banks are in a tight position, damned if you do and damned if you don't. If they make money next year selling those bonds, the public gonna hate them, if they lose money and get bailed out, the public gonna hate them. So they said hey if you gonna be hated either way best to make money out of it.

Why do I believe your analysis - banks assets have been increasing every month, credit is tightening, mortgages lending is down, forbearances, defaults, and a whole host of other stuff, and their assets go up?

Listen to CNBC - buy banks stocks in the long run

Stock go up and the company just fucks shareholders printing shares like the treasury. Revenue growth is not promising at all and they have considerable debt. Oh and looks like they had to report massive goodwill impairment in 2019. And they are just slashing all marketing and development investments this year to try to convince poor investors that the company is improving but it is actually really scary close to going under. Yes if they get bought you will probably make a lot of money but you should know that a buyout is the only way this company will ever turn around and I don‚Äôt see any chance of Lyft touching a company that is reporting goodwill impairment like that. Good luck!

TLDR: I‚Äôm trying to save u from making the same mistake as me. Finances do not look promising and a buyout is the ONLY way they are going to rebound. It‚Äôs a pure gamble.
Hope you‚Äôre taking profits often.

VLDR you could argue is promising.  The problem may not be the company itself, but the complicated structure of the SPAC.  Look at what happened with GRAF and VLDR.  VLDR tanked for weeks right after going public, because PIPE investors absolutely unloaded on the market right after the merger.  There wasn't a lockout period for shareholders to unload.  GRAF got $150M in PIPE.  

A quick google shows CIIC has a whopping $400M in PIPE investors from big names.  It's difficult to tell how many shares that translates into and when PIPE investors will be allowed to unload, but don't be surprised at all if PIPE investors eventually unload.  A price drop could happen dramatically, or the SP of the company after merging could go down and get pinned for weeks/months as PIPE investors unload slowly.  Holders will get frustrated.  Don't bag hold here. If you make profits, get out before the merger happens the company goes public.  You can always pick shares back up once it looks like insiders are done unloading.  Even Draft Kings got bit recently after the lockout period ended.
And selling into the weekend begins now

Actually, you went full retard. I was right the first time. The Union Pacific stock in 1871 is not the same as the one today. 

Union Pacific went bankrupt in 1893. Those shares from 1871 no longer exist!

I didn‚Äòt go through all the details yet if there are any, but afaik there‚Äòs only a annual fee of 1.5%(/0.99% if over 10k) of your portfolio but a huge 15% on all your earnings. But other brokers like plus500 for example don‚Äòt have every stock. Wanted to buy csrs but there‚Äòs none on the platform. And i could also go with swissquote but they ask 9$ for any investment under 500 and 15$ on US stocks. But no other percentages so that‚Äòs a plus. But the swissquote demo didn‚Äòt work for me and i honestly want to try it first before i do real stuff. (Although i already made 200$ in a few hours today off of 1000$ in a demo. The demo also had 10$ fees on every us trade. so i won‚Äòt be too fucked in the real world if i don‚Äòt go stupid right at the beginning)

As long as i get some pltr and nio in the next few weeks at a considerable broker I‚Äòm happy. Wan‚Äòt to start trading with 1000$ and work my way up.
I'm not even a lotr fan but I need some lotr Palantir memes.

MY FELLOW TESLA BROTHERS. LET US COME TOGETHER TO COMBINE LIFE FORCES WITH THAT OF THE GREATEST MEME STONK OF ALL TIME. ELON TAKE OUR ENERGY!!!
Me neither. I hard 2 rumors. Gme was offered a buy out and ceo George was considering it. And the other is that rc is doing a hostile takeover.  At this point I really just need to flip paper.
Na they have all the dead body fridges they can use for vaccines
Nah, don't burn that bridge.   20 years from now you might have a momentary setback and need 5k to keep your house and it won't be there.
Works until your stuck bagholding 4 of them when demand goes down. Unless your only doing them one at a time
I agree with you here 100% I own shares of SBE and was confused why OP is calling them out. SBE / ChargePoint is a gold mine right now.

Good day to buy after this drop.

so fellas in CIIC, was this truly a pump and dump? i refuse to believe that! we arent even below after hrs yesterday... and the volume was only 31 million? avg volume 300k? is it because its such a new listing? i see heller volume on all other ev, whats good with this one? spac investing limited?
There‚Äôs been some pretty good dips right at open the past 2 days before liftoff. I would buy if it happens again tomorrow.
Jokes on you. My dyslexic ass has been buying this since the CEO tweeted about the price being too high

I keep imagining those lucky tards that post big gains being on their yachts right now with tons of Ladyboys. But I know they probably already yolo'd it and lost it all.
Not the hero wsb deserves, but the one we need.
Honestly could go either way, looks like a lot of pain for theta gang if it closes above 18 but there has been ample chances to close out positions this week as well.

Would you recommend a Leap on GM? I have a feeling relations with china might go sour and more investors will flock to american companies. Also does Japan have a full on EV company?
SO GLAD I BOUGHT THE AMD DIP YST. TESLA NEEDS TO GET TO $550 UMMM TMRW. THANKS ELON
Wall Street has been pushing EV for over a decade. Buffett bought BYD in 2008. Tesla was started in 2003. It took 10+ years for general public to pick up on that turned. Wall Street started to push 5G 4 years ago, so I guess in next 4-6 years, 5G will be huge.
Need to manifest aryo hype to get it to at least $7 tomorrow

RIDE is solid, they bought an old plant from GM and everything, even got some of those yellow robot arm thingys that all the large market cap boys have. Even SBE is solid. Now NKLA is probably trash until GM gets serious about them

I'll stick to shares. Cfd / options feel like betting on sports. You win or lose the bet
You seem like you‚Äôre young and new. That‚Äôs a great day. You obviously have some weird expectations of the market. 6% day is huge anyway you slice it.
It‚Äôs neither - it‚Äôs a small cap play with upside. I bought in probably same time as you and can‚Äôt say there is safe money on this. 

Even with this huge jump it has a tiny market cap and tiny float. People like us seem to be buying on spec. Probably a bunch of money to made short term as long as you aren‚Äôt stuck holding when the music stops. 

I‚Äôm spending my night reading up on the potential of dilution coming up so I wouldn‚Äôt play calls on this short term unless you independently verify that there isn‚Äôt some massive offering coming in the next week.

Also - fuck me for being rude. Congrats on the gains pal!! Hope you were as pumped as me watching it soar today. I‚Äôm just stressing on what to do next.
CIIC drillin AH get in while u can (or want)

Okay CIIC, you do your thing. I‚Äôll wait a month and see what you do
Lol they have no potential.  They are a company here, their ICE cars are limited production. This company wont even be able to grow a production line without tsla or the 10 other ev manufactures here crushing them. There are Tsla cars everywhere here.

How are you fucked all you had to do was buy shares and hold, could still do it now and be a huge winner in a few months
That sucks
Stimulus discussions soon! Haven‚Äôt heard that one before.
Pltr 50$ EOY then after employee sell off 30$ then goes to 50$ again
So you are the one I‚Äôve been supporting
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs stuck below it‚Äôs ipo price when none of this shit was happening and has failed to capitalize on the perfect environment for its product
Just ease into it. Buy some here and there. DCA
Yeah and I've used the premium to buy more shares. It's easy to get fucked with how fast this goes up though, I sold a 19.5 11/20 that I'm hoping theta can take another bite out of tomorrow morning
same here.  prob gonna roll to next week 20's if they go ITM
If your objective is to get down to $0, then yeah that loooks about right

They opened a physical location in Portland awhile back. I thought it would be like, a lot or a storefront or something. No, they leased a KIOSK outside of a Nordstrom in a mall.
Niu.
You roll it up and out. You buy the 3 contracts at a loss and sell 3 contracts further up (say $25) and out (say 3 weeks from now). The idea is that eventually it will go down for you to profit from the covered call without losing your shares.
go up
I diddddddn't. I went all in with xpeng today. When dip comes, I'll get some SBE

Just bought 100 shares of palantier. What does it do?
When I first started investing I was up a shit load on aphria (pre legalization) I was up about 30k. Decided to set a "stop loss" close to my buy in. 930 am hits and my phone bleeps.

I think most people are aware that NIO will hit 60$, it's just a matter of when. I'm sure a lot of tards, including myself, got fucked today cause we bet that it would moon after earnings. Give it a couple months or years or whatever and it'll hit 60$. Stocks only go up friend

PSHHHH, don't post on this sub unless you are buying 0-day expiration calls with your sons college fund
Yo wtf
I have been long and posting DD's about palantir since day one.

I think long term stock positions or leaps are still a great idea.

Short term calls at this point are a bad idea.
any Palantir shareholders selling covered calls?

That's a lot. Maybe don't be retarded and buy 520C exp 11/20 at the literal top
You know whoever is downvoting is gonna lose a lot tomorrow
This is a moon for sure. A 10x from here sir still incredibly early
Yea I was thinking the exact same lmfao. I got a shit ton of 1/2021. I think I‚Äôll probably sell in December and then wait for the inevitable dip that will happen in February when Soros and other can sell the rest of their shares.
Sorry man.

Tesla 550 tomorrow?
It's going to hit 20 AH.
You smell like shit.
Ski resorts make their money in hotels, restaurants, property sales, a little bit in lessons. Lift tickets only generate enough to keep the lights on. 

If the resorts stay open BUT the restaurants have to do only takeout or shut down entirely then you will see a drop. However, vail has huge income streams though real estate which is fucking booming because of covid. No shutdown is gonna stop rich people from fleeing to the hills and buying those million dollar properties.

Also, the epic pass is just a way for the resort to generate pre season cash. They need to visitors to buy the $16 hamburgers and put little Johnny in a $800 ski lesson.

POS: straddle this stock

These metrics don‚Äôt work. You are using value metrics on index‚Äôs that are overweight growth. Of course you are going to find correlations but that doesn‚Äôt mean causation. At any point these companies could drop all R&D and you‚Äôd have the lowest PE‚Äôs ever you‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs bullish but if growth isn‚Äôt being found it means we are big fucked.

Ok, real question, I bought 500 shares of BLNK a few days ago at 10 bucks a share. I sold 3 calls against it @ 15. They‚Äôre now ITM and will probably be exercised.

Do I: buy back the 3 contracts at a loss and ride 500 shares into the sunset? Or sell 300 shares for ~50% profit in a week and ride 200 shares instead?

Covid only affects poor people. Poor people don‚Äôt ski. There are lots of rich people who have more money than ever because they canceled their summer vacations itching to get out.

I'm going regret DH TSLA tomorrow right?
add some green and you have the autist association portfolio
My Jan2023 CRWD leaps are up 45% since November 10th when it dipped below 120
When people tell you to take profit, they mean you sell your winning position and get into even more risky positions because you are smart enough to get into the winning position the first time, right?
Smart plan... if you hate money.
IT'S AFTER HOURS NOW BITCH, TIME TO BLOW THROUGH ALL INTRADAY RESISTANCES BITCHES
Bought my mom shares in FUBO, NIO and PLTR on Monday. Hopefully she‚Äôll love me again and I can come over for the holidays.

Just learned about RIOT yesterday even though I've been pro coin since 2012. Checked out their website, looks like they are DRASTICALLY increasing their mining fleet in January, to be fully implemented by April. More efficient mining + rising price per coin = holy fucking shit the tendies next year are going to be unbelievable. People can hate on the coin cause they don't understand it, but there's a finite supply and always gaining more mainstream adoption. If it ever gets to a point of being actual currency it's going to need an absurdly higher value than where it is right now.

Is CIIC gonna hit 20 tomorrow?
ROST just hit me with that stimulus check, let's get COVID solved overnight and have a full green day tomorrow ü§ò
Lot of resistance on TSLA today. My guess is it dips tomorrow, and if it doesn‚Äôt, only goes up like another 2-3%
Wtf happened to NKLA? Why are people buying this?
Up 66.11% Today, bringing my All-time down to -68.58% Right now. It's not much, but its honest work thanks to CRSR and PLTR. 

**W**
How did you not see that was where it was stopping, it was so clear
I think it‚Äôs going to hit 20$ then have a pull back

Salt bear starts at 4pm, here come the downvotes
Hard for to make a judgement call without the context of your whole portfolio and how aggressively you prefer to trade.

The easiest rule I‚Äôve learned to follow is, if your gains are satisfying enough to screenshot, sell.

My mistake would have been selling too early, though. I probably would‚Äôve sold at like 200% profit
The one gives stupid advice might actually be one who sells them to OP
CRSR will never stop going up. CRSR/PTON 401k guy fucked up.

This is literally the best time to buy CIIC, merger with Arrival expected to close Q1 of 2021, and production of orders starts Q4 of 2021.
Plus they already have 1.2 billion in orders lined up including from UPS

It gets you greater exposure to the stock at a fraction of the cost. Hopefully he bought it with a nice and high delta so his exposure stays relevant. The Theta decay on those long term holds starts real slow.

Well, think about how everyone was into tech not that long ago. Now you barely see aapl and co posts because everyone got a new toy to play with. Tech is boring, EV is in season. Will it eventually play out and cool down? Sure. But for that to happen we need new sector and there isn‚Äôt one.

What I meant happened today
I was promised tendies from CIIC. I demand an explanation.
Their data analysis is so advanced that they already had billions of data points on your behavior. They don't need to scan your comments. They can predict what you're going to say before you say it.
and so the AM pump begins

not true, if they are 20's ur chilling hard lol just get the shares called, max it goes to is 22 if they truly decide to wild the fuck out

Holy fuck

Since you didn‚Äôt end your last sentence with a period I‚Äôll assume the story you‚Äôre feeling isn‚Äôt over and you have more fantasy to tell us. By all means continue.

Opinions are changing on how we can best respond to covid though. Activists/Politicians are beginning to accept that being outside is extremely safe relative to being shut inside. I think there may be more restrictions on bars/retail/restaurants, but less on outdoor activities going forward.

Might be wishful thinking, but AMD looks like it wants to breakout to 90. Semis look good overall.
I'd say that's a fair assessment. A little birdie who does this stuff for a living told me that's the main stock he's buying up on the dips, that's what got me into it. It's paid off so far

Will do. I looked up IV and rhe standard deviations bit im a little confused on. I know it shows a standard deviation of where the price can go in between, im having trouble understanding what that means for me and my buying decision
I switch around from bullish and bearish about 100 times from 3:58-4pm every day
Most likely in the morning, then just like today it‚Äôll rise in the afternoon. PLTR likes to stroke real slow

The retards who bought NKLA at 60 and sold at 20 are the reason Elon is issuing caution. Chargepoint actually has product in the world and shouldn‚Äôt be roped into this same conversation. After the merger, Chargepoint will break $50.
Like i said, you think the bubble is about to pop, buy puts. Otherwise, shut the fuck up.
I don‚Äôt know why I only bought 2 shares @5.98. Feels bad man

Yup, I‚Äôm not understanding where people get the idea that tech is somehow not going to be needed when COVID is gone
Need a cigarette just for reading this
Ok. Rumor why gme is up is because rc has gone over 10% and is doing a hostile takeover and he's going to be acting ceo tomorrow.  Some big shorts unwound causing the pops today. Either a 8 and 13k drop today and proves the rumors or its a fuckin garbage heap myth.
No idea, I got 362 calls, so one of us is making money.
NO REASON?!?!!??? God damn some of you guys here are clueless

I like that, I just started screwing around with some covered calls on FCEL and made a couple bucks on some SPY calls. How far out do you guys sell calls for? The nearest date?
I shouldn‚Äôt have sold so many covered calls for PLTR tomorrow. I‚Äôm going to miss all the upside :(

Well, I am the last guy that wrote a [discussion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/j3fhvs/the_dangers_of_counterfeit_vape_cartridges/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on how all EV stocks are overvalued. I don't when it'll burst, but I do know that come Dec 21st Nikola's IPO lockup ends (giving big investors the ability to get their money out of the scam), and also Tesla joins the S&P and index funds will buy it.

Anyone know whats up with XEL?

Are you joking? We are probably finishing above $360 tomorrow
I'm not a bear LMAO. I'm just explaining why a 13-F is not relevant for a systematic hedge fund like Rentech. Look up how the strategy works before you start sputtering nonsense.
It the one company that is guaranteed to make more money as soon as vaccines print, and they will print... until that day its a slow burn up to the moon. The days after the vaccine news really hits is the day it lands next to elon on mars.
If the Fed is hammering Congress to pass new stimulus, wouldn't the market simply maintain/rebound once stimulus talks resume? What's preventing renewed stimulus negotiations from completely fucking your position?
Yea it was over the last few days now its taking a rest. Yesterday was sell the news.
Aye
Kenny just tryna fuck. Respect
+55% on the day!!
EV is shaping up to be the dot com bubble of our generation. I‚Äôm just running with this and cashing out at the first sign of an blow off.
Announced they're running a pilot program in Orlando and everyone lost their shit
Prepare for dump AH üòî
That bubble will pop but maybe after you‚Äôve been taken to the cleaners by Xi
Only if your portfolio has a majority of leap nio calls

Its not burnt until you sell it ü§™
even if this doesnt blow up i still saved post because this is a really cool idea. i also like that you did % not $ because some people will be like "up 5k" but be down 100K all time

Damn you made that much money bruh?
PLTR ending at 18.98 what a cock tease you little twink slut!

Not gonna look at ah action, but edge myself on that finish.
Oof
I made about $15 on my shares ‚úå

25 shares LMAO. Although being completely flat around the $550 price level is a huge fucking win for NVDA stock
the things that move the market are 'surprises'.  covid getting worse isn't a surprise.  the reactions will likely be minor; not like the 20-30% bed-shitting session we had in late Feb / March
Hopefully
Oh god

I just out 20k into boeing 230c expiring next friday
LMFAO.  Is she legit retarded? Pay them to stay home and develop depression and substance abuse problems!

did you see the sell wall at 19.00? it‚Äôs fucking massive
BABA 300
The morning V shaped recovery wasn't enough? There is plenty of money on the sideline to buy these dips.
Nio and xpeng are unveiling their gen 2 cars tomorrow. Could be why.

Praying to fucking Jack Ma and Chinese Winnie the Pooh that this shit closes above $260 tomorrow.

Although it does feel greedy risking assignment for an extra $600
Praise be to Elon
It‚Äôs up 12%
Really hope you idiots that had massive gains in KNDI and FUV sold... there‚Äôs no fucking way those increases are justifiable
Tomorrow i will sell every stock i have if we‚Äòre green

11/27 545c was a trip today.
LMFAOO why pltr ended 18.99 wow
Up to $9.70 AH and back to $8.20 at open
That's how TSLA started. Literally by reverse-engineering golf carts. Look up history of TSLA. Elon did not start TSLA, btw.
It‚Äôs going to pump first, then may level off
Thought about picking up goodrx at close yesterday. Thought nah it should sink more.
I think they‚Äôre primed to get bought out by a company like Lyft
We go again tomorrow palantards
You and Icahn

Just a penny short
18.98 MARKET MANIPULATION BRO

&#x200B;

still 6% tho
My bro and his fam are arriving to ski breck on the 21st
PLTR 20 tmmrw
I've never dug into TTD much just because the share price is so expensive, I want something with more potential upside. But from a quick read, they're similar. MGNI focuses on streaming entrainment which is obviously the route most consumers are going vs traditional cable. It's also getting added to more and more hedge fund portfolios which should tell you something
EBs bro, get on board
u/StevenVanMetre  Great post, seems pretty spot on.  I suspect after the election is when things will really start to head down.  


Do you understand that the banking system works on whats called "fractional reserve system"?  


When the FED injects those extra reserve assets, it allows the banks to create an 10x extra that amount of money they hold on their balance sheets. So if the FED injects 1million into a commercial banks reserve assets, it essentially allows the commercial bank to loan out, or use up to 10million in assets. That's how the FED indirectly prints money.
BLNK and FCEL calls holding overnight there's no stopping these ones yet!!
Whoever said to get call  options in FUV, I love you
PLTR stopping at 18.98 is the biggest edge I‚Äôve ever had
Dildos down boys
DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING
seems like there's a strong correlation
Soon you won't have money. I hate TSLA but I have calls.
What language is the bot written in
They did.. I also am seeing the controversy now with the botox. I sold 3p and bought 2ps to cover my ass if it drops a ton for any reason
Imagine any fake headline pumping 1% but shit shutting down is only -0.01%. Bears are clowns.
cock tease
[deleted]
There are so many EV stocks now hard to keep up...
Pumps like these are a warning sign for bears to pull out and also why we will never win
6% up today... ill take it
Load up boys

Yeah no one actually wants to drive around homosexual mini fridges like SOLO tho
I'm big on APHA, everyone seems to agree they're the best overall weed company. 200 shares and a few $6c 1/15/21.

I shorted nio lmaoo
#GG
you need insider tipsüëÄit cost 9küí≤ü§£ü§£
Aye
I work as a beer salesman that serves grocery stores. I sell in white claw and truly. The hard seltzer market is very crowded right now. If you want to buy stock with hard seltzers, buy SAM. They own Truly. The Truly brand has been the only seltzer to take a bite out of white claws market share....dont believe me? Look at SAM stock this last year. I bought in just before it popped in early summer.
That‚Äôs hot, except Tim make it that girl with the huge knockers sitting in the background of Trumps townhall a few months ago
god speed in AH everyone.
You could have bought them yesterday for $1 and sold them today for $16. This app is free try it TitanFlow.io

You haven‚Äôt learned yet that earnings always fall do to IV crush? NIO could‚Äôve tripled earnings and posted a billion profit on the Same day Trump announces a new trade agreement with China and it still would‚Äôve fucking fallen
Tysons so broke they can't afford to not work people like slaves
GME seems to be cupping back to $15. Any thoughts?
My break even point is below (or currently almost at) the current trading price. That‚Äôs what I mean

Sold solo for a big loss on Monday. That‚Äôs all you need to know
Anyone know what to do with FUV? Stay clear or try and play it
this shit is g\*\*. but if you want some advice. play day trades tomorrow. we'll probably retest 358 another 3 or 4 times -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-
A lot of shit can happen in 3 years. A lot of good too... so yes it will either go up or down.
Probably for the best tbh

Edit: nvm I've seen your response lol. I'll look through those
some fuckwit brigade downvoting every single post
About QE:

After the bank puts their X dollars in the reserves they loan out 10X in liquid money using the X dollars as fractional reserves.

The FED says they are creating liquidity because that‚Äôs exactly what they are doing.

This is why borrowing money has become dirt cheap, because the fed is flooding the market with dollars, whether directly or not.
saw some dude post about it a million times before it blew up, but you know honestly no offense cause im proud and all but this just one of those stocks you were holding at the right time and just got incredible blessed on

VTRS is going big tomorrow. You‚Äôve got 2 mins to get in
APHA is probably a buy here. It's weak today compared to peers and the market just freaked out about an updated/amended F-10 filing. It was just to update the share sell for the sweet water deal.
SPY 360 tomorrow, and TSLA 515+
tsla lurkers are kinda quiet no? maybe a chance to unload those 500+ c tomorrow...or will iv n theta have wiped them......?

the gall of them MM to do this tip toe dance at 498/499 just to drive home how they have total control and will fck over everyone with glee 

y all need to get your chance at running the show and tear this whole rigged boomer system apart and burn it, twice.
AMAT shares been cancelling out a portion of my losses for years now, Just broke 400% total return today.

That‚Äôs not how this will play out. Greater than 50% of Americans will get the vaccine in the first half of 2021. As they do, case numbers will plummet and everything will open back up. Even those who choose not to get the vaccine will be protected due to herd immunity at that point. It‚Äôll be business as usual by July. 

In your example, an obese boomer who gets the vaccine will see his risk of dying from covid drop from 3-4 percent down to far less than 1 percent thanks to the efficacy of the vaccine and herd immunity. The cruise lines and Vegas buffets will be packed.
How far back did you buy them? Because IV seems to rape me anymore

No time for DD at this point. But buy some GIK before close
That PLTR daily chart is so nice. Slow burn up
Best to be safe with weeklies, especially 1dte ones. Unless you're buying them 1dte or 0dte to leverage yourself cheaply with high risk

Valuations do not matter. As long as companies post what the market considers "good" earnings, stocks will keep going up. Clearly the market is looking past COVID into 2021, as long as any company can keep showing that they are recovering and can survive until COVID ends and then continue growing afterward, their stock will go up. Many retailers, airlines, cruise lines etc fall into this category, which is why they are performing so well despite eating shit in the near term.
Just bailed out of spy puts at a loss so it's gonna dump overnight just FYI
I feel like since a lot of options are expiring tomorrow MMs are gonna make it red so people don‚Äôt profit. Lock in EV profits today?

Should I bet my life savings on AMD 90c for tomorrow?
Generally the autist on here after blowing up their accounts yoloing into weeklies or 0DTE, tend to work behind a Wendy's (usually near the dumpster due to privacy) over the weekend sucking cock or giving out handjobs. In order to load up their accounts to play next week. 

 Personally I take a corner restroom at the bus station due to my arthritis needing some heat, but I digress. 

OP was alluding that he would like to meet up behind a Wendy's with old girl up there to suck his cock. 

I was alluding to not seeing a cock bulge in the bikini bottoms, so OP wouldn't have a cock to suck to make his money to play the market next week.

But I don't judge, we all need a way to pay for our addictions. 

Savvy?
Done. Big stock purchase, cash out in a few years, retire on a yacht.
If I get rich I will buy stocktwats.com and redirect it to this sub
Tesla being manic
lmao
The main difference between the real guy and OP is the time frame. OP has options for a month out whereas the really guys thesis is over time. This could mean mistiming or even that the move is slow enough to kill the options.

> As you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations. 


Lol no. You can‚Äôt just fucking say it keeps rejecting new highs when we just made one, and then say ‚Äúok but that was a one off‚Äù. It could very well test and break it again. What if it breaks 3660 on some other stimulus vaccine need? ‚ÄúOk but its just another one off that was rejected, won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù It‚Äôs overvalued but very likely your timing is way off.

the person "he bought the shares" from is only getting whatever he paid for the shares, no more no less. If he buys and then the value later drops, the money it dropped by afterwards is literally and not figuratively gone. That's lost in valuation because these are all just valuations. Someone sells for 10, and now it's worth 8, the seller isn't getting back the 2 dollars he lost.

&#x200B;

I don't know if you're just used to dealing with the retards on here or what and you just made an assumption based on what i was saying, but this shit literally becomes your socks somehow disappearing in the dryer. There is money dissipating that no one gets to see, simply based off of how this value is constructed.
Plus all the ppl that still bought season passes - so the resort has that cash and will see cost to run decrease because they are shut down

I don't understand what your problem is. I literally said i laughed first and processed it later. You compared two extremely different situations to say i shouldn't have been disgusted by it. Yoloing and losing money is funny because party involved is literally aware of the risk they put in. Workers are told that precautions are being taken to prevent the spread and workplace is made safe. And then managers go and put bets like this, it is distasteful. Headline makes it funny, sure. But that laughter is always going to be short lived. Lot of comedians do tragedy jokes with this same intention, to make us laugh and then think, Ricky gervais for example. 

And yeah i was wrong about calling managers millionaires. I read "execs" in my mind.

Here‚Äôs some honest advice. If you‚Äôre in NIO and you don‚Äôt have diamond hands just do yourself a favor and get the fuck out. That‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre gunna make bank off it don‚Äôt try to day trade it. Just buy it and hold until you‚Äôre happy with 2X 3X 4X or however high you wanna go.

Adding shares of PLTR is the consensus.

bruh I bought NIO Dec 60 calls when NIO dipped to $41 last week. NIO is now $48 but my calls are worth less than when i bought them

what the fuck is going on
RIP
HIBB or FL
Naw it will dip back under $19 at some point.  It‚Äôs making higher lows but it‚Äôs not parabolic.  Instead of dipped down to 18 it will dip to like $18.30 instead.  

I wouldn‚Äôt buy weeklies on it but I am pretty comfortable with my Dec and Jan calls
PLTR bout to run up AH
TSLA ZM NVDA DKNG lets get it
He‚Äôs worried
Crazy that you can literally build a 3 wheeled golf cart and that justifies a half billion market cap... Puts on FUV... at some point

Make PLTR 19 again!
You're right but I hate the bleeding, still considering throwing another 10k at it tho
This is investing, not something you should turn to to get your next fix. go do some drugs or something if your that bored, retard
How could you ever time that? The jump could be in 2 months but you only buy a 1 month contract. If you buy leaps or shares at least you are hedging your bet on when the sudden jump is gonna happen

Lol why do you give it 2 months? That seems like a really small timeframe. On top of that your options are giving only one month. 

I follow the actually Steven Van Metre yt/twitter and he even preaches a longer timeframe. I'd you're gonna take his name, take his thesis.

The goal here is the sudden jump that may occur starting today. You pick up an option at the very bottom then sell off as soon as the market opens after the rise. Easy 100-300 %
Bill Gates says you are
Sold my SBE  $25C 12/18 for $3.20 when I bought for $110 yesterday. Why did I only grab one... idk but I might jump back in before EOD. CRSR poppin off too, up 71% on $40C 12/18.
What‚Äôs the opposite of catching a falling knife? Shoving a knife up your ass? I‚Äôm going to call buying puts on a rocket ship being gaddafi‚Äôd

11/27 395c seem a little optimistic lol but just might work all we need is one good sentence of positive news on stimulus and those just might print. I have 65, 67 and 70c

"The most straightforward answer to this question is that it actually disappeared into thin air, along with the decrease in demand for the stock, or, more specifically, the decrease in investors' favorable perception of it."

" \[...\] you're holding a stock and the price drops, leading you to sell it for a loss. The person buying it at that lower price‚Äìthe price you sold it for‚Äìdoesn't necessarily profit from your loss and must wait for the stock to rise before making a profit."

The company that issued the stock doesn't get the money from your dealing stock price either. The brokerage firm is also left empty-handed since you only paid it to make the transaction on your behalf."

Hey, GJ on the DD. There is a couple problems however. 

&#x200B;

The main one is your historical projection. Since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century the stock market has become increasingly separate from the "real economy." This has caused a fake economy to develop according to economists, a trend that has only increased under the tech boom of the last 20 years. Basically this is a trend that people have been projecting for the past 5 decades. Every month somebody else has a prophesized "pop" date, a date when the market plummets. 

&#x200B;

Ill tell you whats going to happen. The market explodes and everyone cries for a bit and shifts more of their portfolio into the tech sector. The reason behind this is because of the insane P/E and EBIT. The Market wont crash because of one primary reason as listed below. 

&#x200B;

THE PRIMARY REASON: 

If the western world's market starts to fall as your projecting then the U.S will go to war with another nation to exploit the resource drain. This happened in the Cold War, WWII, and WWI. If the big industries start to decline then the United States will bail them out, the 2008 crisis showed that. If the tech sector decides to sell coal instead of Iphones then people will just transition their investments. 

&#x200B;

In other words nothing is going to change and your options will expire worthless. 

&#x200B;

Best of luck man.
Baba leaps obvs

Also...even the casual observer knows the market is primed to dump, but the fed may have other plans.

What did you buy at? Just look at its intrinsic value for the easiest ballpark answer, at 18.82 if it stays right there they'll be worth 32 bucks each (obviously a tad more at open).
I sold 5c Monday for $.15... I'm just gonna have to let it get exersized

I got 100 contracts for the $25 strike expiring 11/27. Patiently waiting for lift off.
what? I'm not talking about it going up or down.  I'm just wondering why at any point it was 250k for a share.  Did the company start and initially only have 1 share and more got sold diluting that 1 share?
This stock is fueled by WSB.

My cost basis is so fucking low that even with a massive sell-off, I'll be so far ahead. Let the talkers talk, I'll be making dough regardless. This thing hits $100, I'll have enough for a 20% down payment on a house in the Bay Area, and I still wouldn't buy it, because then that means I have enough for 40% down literally everywhere else.

Your analysis of the credit markets shouldn't focus exclusively on commercial loans. The consumer loan side is hot as hell. The housing market is red hot both new homes and re-sale. Car sales (no, not just TSLA you autists) are way up. Businesses are not taking out loans. Individuals are for big purchases. In other words, the money printer is going brrr.

where do you see tesla in a month ?
Ok you don‚Äôt understand why tech when up cause of covid...

Tech went up because adoption was accelerated.  So pretty much in everyone model old people were never gonna pay with an app or shop with an app. So every year tech grows as old people die and young people adopt the new technology.

So COVID said hey old people you need to learn how to use an app or you will have a chance of dying.  So old people were like shit better learn how to use e-commerce so I don‚Äôt die.  So now all tech models showing adoption had to change.

Once there is a vaccine that is distributed you have to ask will it change how people use technology.  Probably not old people will be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old and tired why would I fight traffic go to the store and shop when someone can bring them to me.‚Äù 

So the adoption accelerated the user base, but it‚Äôs not going to revert back.  For example Disney hit 2025 Disney+ subscriber numbers this year at 70 million .... so you think after the vaccine that number is going to drop down to 20 million because that‚Äôs where it was projected before COVID... the answer is no

And if you think it‚Äôs yes then you are a Patrick

Alrighty meng tin foil hat time and I better not get any shit for it. 

Lockdown phase 2 = stoinks go up, 
stimmy check v2 = stoinks go up,
Crsr massively undervalued = stoinks go up
Logi sells for 80$ so I can buy 2 shares of crsr for same price 
= Stoinks go up
Crsr had blow out earnings just like Logi = Stoinks go up

Honestly I turned off my brain today, sold my last 6 30$ 12/18 and reloaded into 40$ 12/18 bought 20 and If I hold long enough I can sell each of these bad boys for 1k each or more depending On how Diamond my hands will be since 20k is still 20k.

I also have 20$c 5/21 -- 30$c 5/21 -- 35$c 5/21 holding a couple of each so my belief is q1 next year will be just duumb dumb good and we could go to 70-80ish like Logi. 

Okay take off tin foil hat my head hurts.

Good luck man

Is it just me, or did the "talks going well" update suck all the money out of speculative tech plays and rotate it into boomer reopening stocks?
I‚Äôm waiting till NIO pulls back then buying 1/15 calls
Around 500 shares at 18.50
they somehow taste worse than regular beer in a can too
"stim talks going well" always seem to come in at the perfect times when SPY needs it

i swear these gov officials are staring at their portfolios all day, its ridiculous
[removed]
You're gonna try to tell me TSLA won't rip to 550 tomorrow? ALL. IN.

Nah, jk. I'm gonna avg down a bit on my 500s if they let me, but not going over 5% of my portfolio on this one.

11/20 18.5c has a theta of -.2110. Delta is only .3559. If it opens at the same level tomorrow as it is now you $58 a call could drop to $37 or lower. 

Just estimates though.
FUCK TESLA WALMART IS THE MOVE

How come no one talking about FUV
I‚Äôm dying laughing
no way zm is not going up. schools are closing...covid ramping up. everyone i know is getting it and stuck at home...
prob going to hit new all-time highs soon as we hear "talks going well"
If I could snag a GLE I‚Äôd definitely do it, only reason I lean GLB is we don‚Äôt have kids yet so don‚Äôt need the extra space and GLB has that sexy brand new screen that goes across the entire dash also which is what I want haha. Can get a loaded GLB for the price of a mid range GLE is my main influence atm
Couldn‚Äôt sell my gains once again due to PDT, worst fucking rule ever.
Good chance you're right. 12/8 earnings is my mental safety net lol.  Still hoping it'll pop on news of a deal with a sony or something else before then.

Yes keep it up soldier
Holy shit.

this makes me think a hard strike in inflation is about to happen. the dollar is literally becoming so undervalued with this pandemic. literally everyone and their mother is cashing in.
Duhhhh
Wait a bit after opening so it can drop then go in
Becky did a HIIT class that was too hard.
You actually made me buy shares just now. In for 500 shares of PFE
Since I fuck wit u bro lemme give u some good DD on DG 

\*\*DG\*\* 

Has not had a single year where store openings has gone down. In fact, just opened their 17,000th store, last year they had 15,400 stores or some shit.

Has not had a single year, quarter, where same store sales have been down. in fact coronavirus has made shoppers more cost-caring and going to these dicount store (DG is NOT a dollar store, like DLTR, they're more like a cheaper WMT)

I'm betting they hit $230 after earnings, also IV is very low on some of these options as if earnings isn't happening. very interesting, i expect a bigger move into earnings. 

\*\*AES\*\*

nothing much here. its a very diverse company that supplies energy in places like Argentina, Brazil, and also the US and Europe. They struggled from currency devaluations but recently set up contracts to make all payments in dollar-denominated amounts 

only other piece of info is they'd probably do well under biden administration, they are shifting away from coal and gas and moving to solar and wind. and especially being able to store this energy in batteries for when its dry or dark out.

Lastly, and probably the most important thing for AES, is just like FISV, someone has been buying calls and executing them and rolling them out. Ex. Last sept/oct they bought a shitton of 19calls, those went ITM. now they have 22calls (22,000 OI/volume)
I have this problem where I bought stocks low and now they're high.
even better üòñ
Can tech just moon already? Holy fuck what a gay ass day
That's fair, riskier but the hyper growth stage is coming for them right now. I guess I'd rather stick to the safest option.

Yeah, tried to message you to thank you as well. Even with the way you talked to us I'll accept it if the tips are good. I got a Dec call on this thing and it's already up a nice amount. How long would you suggest I hold it for, all the way through? Should I buy more to expire in summer 21?

You missed the part where the vaccine wont change anything for at least a year. It is 90% effective. If you were an obese boomer with diabetes would you take a 10% chance of getting covid? They won't. At least 1/3 of all boomers won't go back to normal without the virus completely gone first. Probably 1/10 of paranoid gen x and y will do the same. Half of the entire US won't get the vaccine because they don't trust Trump or were they were anti vaccine before covid. The virus won't be widely available for at least 6 months even if everyone would get it.

same here. I am at 50% which is my largest cash position this year.  I was thinking we would get a pullback and have a strong rally into the end of the year.  Looks like we might just go sideways and the go up. 

It is hard to put money to work right here.

so this is a good entry point right?

they are back to pumping stimulus which means we are gonna be seeing a lot more "stim talks going well" these next few days

Dec 31, 2021, I think it can. That'd be a P/E of like 8. Def depends on what the overall market does next year though.
We keep getting rejected at 19 we are consolidating for a move up or a sharp move down 5 percent on this stock is way different Than other stocks genius

Those bottle-shaped cans of beer are absolute dogshit. They advertise it like "oooh you get so much more beer" but in reality half of your beer fucking foams over so you probably get EVEN LESS beer. This is bullshit.

Only good aspect of them is that when you re-cap them and throw the empty cans into a fire they explode.
The DD would literally get downvoted on this sub yet somehow tanked the stock. Unbelievable. NIO is the best of the Chinese EVs and the one with the most likely growth outside of China so I can see Tesla levels in the future for this. Let‚Äôs make that money my guy ü§ú

u right, but what about the 2000% left on the table??
Maybe if it can stabilize at 19 at close. It's honestly a resistance point whether I pump more money into it, or I start thinking about closing positions near mid Dec.
They are ditching the EV market & sold a shit ton of shares for $3.50, no reason to stay

On the other side, you've these millionaire assholes who are forcing people to work for minimum wage in a pandemic so they can continue to make money, a place where workers literally died because of covid. And they're betting on how many of these workers will get covid!? Of course one might find it hilarious as I initially did, but it is disgusting as i later realized.

No-one can answer this except for your own balls. Are your nuts made out of steel or paper, are they tingling because you feel a massive run is in the books tomorrow or are they trying to shrivel back inside your body because they know you are about to get fked. Only you (your balls) will know. Risk tolerance and how large your positions (% of portfolio) are will dictate your answer. You could lose 17% today or lose 75% tomorrow, or you could be up 200%.

If the squeeze were to happen I think it begins with earnings tbh even though the new consoles is prob already priced in. I'm in on 12/31 calls so we need Cohen to fuckin force some hands here and get this puppy rolling.
Thank you for your service.

If we make it to January, there will likely be another huge covid19 stimulus which will give markets another shot in the arm and keep things pumping for another 3-6 months.

What you wrote makes rational sense, but the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

Oh yea, CIIC will become Arrival and produce UPS EVs with Blackrock backing..

as an eurocuck living in the US, i can't help but get the feeling I'm constantly being fucked over financially here. from insurance to housing or to even having a bank account. i was shocked to find out there's a monthly fee for not having money in your account at most banks

fuck, being poor here in the US must fucking suck. thank fuck I'm loaded to the tits with NIO calls

Worst part was that the report was utterly useless and baseless and yet it still tanked the fuck out of this. I will be forever pissed even when I‚Äôm raking in the profits from this stock.

I feel you, thankfully mine were only $28k and I had a lot of overseas/overtime work that helped me pay off huge chunks at a time, or I'd still be paying them for another 6 years. I think any loan forgiveness should be coupled with more price controls on colleges that accept federal student loans, the amount spent on administrative personnel, sports, and campus amenities is out of control.

Someone just bought 1.3 million bucks worth of SPY calls 11/23 360 calls

What does this have to do with SBE?
Yes king

Goodbye today‚Äôs gains
For real!
It's hydroponics and vertical farming too - checked the pics online. Really like those but wonder how these would be as investments
I def think it‚Äôll go over 20 but how long and far out is the question. It‚Äôs pretty damn risky now. I got in at 13 and bought a 16c 11/27 on Monday so I‚Äôm somewhat safe. But we‚Äôre all retards so fuck it, buy now ath today. Stonks go up
If you EVER make another long post like this again, I'm going to do more coke.
Took NIO with it :(
that's why you tie up millions for 100,000's profit
PLTR will never break 19 I‚Äôm convinced

Yes it really does. Tiny market cap. I'm up 84% but I guess I'll hold fuck it
Got a cardboard box tip: $IP and $WRK
The price for cardboard across the top 5 companies is going to increase tomorrow by $50/ton. It‚Äôll be announced in Pulp and Paper. I believe with the holiday season coming and everyone ordering more and more packages online. The need for cardboard is there and these companies will see a spike. They could also see a spike if the price for all those boxes is going to go up. I‚Äôm in calls but I think there‚Äôs a play to be made here.

Nio leaps are cheaper and Nio is still in a rapid growth stage that could see its price explode in a 2 year period. Not saying Tesla won‚Äôt but Tesla was pretty stagnant until the S&P inclusion.
My all time chart looks like it needs a dip. Worrisome
Yes, lots of room to the upside as people continue to rebalance away from the stay at home stuff.

This is my first time playin [BABA](https://ibb.co/r3Hdybh) and I feel confident lol

Hold PLTR until you‚Äôre in the grave
I entered previous positions before: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the_bears_arent_done_folks_these_diamond_hands/

I exited those positions for a large profit when it became clear to me that market wasn't ready to tank yet. Here I am at another top in the same positions.

I can ride this shit all year if I have to.

Why do you guys play cool trendy stocks when I swing trade LUV, CVX, HD, and JNJ?

Down 50% today and the delta went from .8 to .4 lol. This one might expire worthless
I called the ACB pop a few weeks ago. Rode that wave for 4000-6000%. 

Rolled that into 12/4 ZM $412c and TSLA 11/20 $465c =profit
CLX fucked me with bleach instead of lube.
RUN FOR THE HILLS MAYBE I'LL DROP ANOTHER CENT.

Relax Jesus.

Elon just so you know I can't get a tesla unless tsla hits 505
Really happy I grabbed an extra thousand shares of PLTR yesterday. 

Now if only I was smart enough to buy a month ago.
"200/5" lmaooooo
TSLA puts lol
raisins
Got you fam <3
This feels like a price probe into the $357.50 trading range by the bulls. I feel like they are testing the waters until we sell off in the next 20 minutes or so.
>Unless the dollar gets completely destroyed

Spoiler: it will.  Hedge with metals, shitcoins or real estate.  Alternatively just short the dollar if you don't wanna be left holding the bag.
As in literally?

Hell yea brother enjoy my free $80

Why do some of your - have a line going above and below, dirt?
Listen to this guy. We're day traders, not in for the long run.
His portfolio is the same size as mine basically. I started with $150k Jan 1st and I'm sitting at $670k today. Most of my portfolio is tsla.

Pltr !
Where is she now?
That one seem sketchy, its on my watch list, 6 employees and a fuck ton of volume ...wish I pivoted into that today, but NIO is alright
Should have up 60% already!
Majority of that gain was from 400 shares of NIO at $1.96
suwoooop (the sound of our portfolios rising)
I dunno, if you hopped on this morning you made out like a bandit.
Of course women like that aren‚Äôt on tinder. They have legions of thirsty guys in their reach in real life

Yes
Genuine question, why get NIO leaps instead of TSLA?
PLTR up 3% from where I bought my 12/18 calls but just now breaking even ü§¨
Can I get a pltr gang check in
18, yeah I might hold if it doesn't spike today
LOL honest af.  I'm in GME too and i'd love that. 

I think the squeeze is expected to be a several week thing predicated on news or something to start off and then snowballing based on algo reactions to price rises. It'd be great to see it start rolling this week though. My Jan calls are starting to make me nervous.
Lol a 10% move in GME barely a 2 bagger on weeklies.

This is why you don't buy 100+% IV options unless you're scalping
I had to adjust my chart. It‚Äôs a bear flag
Maybe not today, possibly tomorrow, but at a minimum we‚Äôre looking at Covid skyrocketing the country over and some dipshits doubling down on stupid policy (Texas governor is about as dumb as can be). 

We‚Äôve already got people traveling for thanksgiving and rates are at an all time high. It‚Äôll cascade in a couple of weeks and hospitals are already full. Hospitalization lags 4 weeks too, so I think the second week of December may see a countrywide lockdown. Imagine the market reacting to that.
ahhh shit you're right
Real question:  what does Sarah Eisen smell like?

Pltr 20 11/20 are cheap for lotto tickets.
The best part about investing is making steady gains for a few months so you decide totl treat yourself to something nice and the next day your portfolio plummets

Been telling people not to FOMO and buy weeklies on Thursday. 

FOMOed and bought a weekly on Thursday.
38 minutes until CIIC pumps again.

I fell for this once. Not again. I'm just gonna do the opposite because the market is illogical and always goes up.

Hahahaha same that was the joke
u good!
Any thoughts on NAKD??

my start up
Feels bad to have been a week early on NIO and XPEV. Theta has fucked me. Get your gains and bounce bois
I'm with you on the bearish bet, I think your timing is 1-3 months early. 

Re banks adding tier1 capital (treasuries): they are padding their capital reserves ahead of REALIZING losses. Between the stimulus and what regulators are telling banks, noone is marking down their loan portfolios yet. If given the option, bankers will put their fingers in their ears and ignore accounts past due as long as they can. I think that stress through policy has been pushed to Q1 2021.

I'm long QQQ puts for March and TSLA stock until just before XMas. Then I'll load up short in the first weeks of January.
really hope so, pretty sure GME calls are the only thing carrying my portfolio right now
I own 55% BABA 1/15/21 calls, 15% CCL NCLH puts 11/27, 10% KCAC and CIIC stock and 20% cash. Rate my portfolio.
Dude timing puts is the most retarded play you can make. Tesla, PRPLE, NIO, RKT, any meme stock, is way less retarded than trying to time puts. You're never going to time it right fuck!
Grab me one of them pretzels please.
Because that holds up some of my portfolio for another year +. And 90% of people here are looking for gambles that hit like crack
Literally makes no sense it‚Äôs mind boggling. This really must be what a bubble feels like

Daddy teach me
calls or puts right here on spy?
If you look at console release dates the past 3 gems and GME stock you‚Äôll see a jump in share price by like 3x. Makes sense regardless if they don‚Äôt buy games for much it‚Äôll still be a major part of their business buying low and selling high used games. 
The only downside is now most video games can be purchased digitally or streaming a subscription service Xbox game pass or the PS Now.

Passed the heroes stimulus with national ballot harvesting and illegal immigrant payments in it so it had zero chance of passing? Is that how she helped the little guy?
OK. thanks.
I‚Äôm not too sure if PLTR has much more to give ?

Yes indeed
I hope so
How lol
Are they growing vegetables vertically? I‚Äôm not in on any ag that isn‚Äôt vertical.
Good post. Not happening tho. We are heading up, stop the nonsense bear talk and deal with it. Between vaccines, new president, and companies continuing to beat earnings idk how you could say otherwise. Is there scared bears out there? yes, can they move the market a bit? Sure, but we are heading up. We could have a slight 10% drop, then hang on for all time highs.
Down goes TSLA
it was way overdue after ER
Unless the dollar gets completely destroyed, igniting an inflationary megabubble where people are forced to chase stonks just to preserve their capital, this might not be the best time to deploy capital into the market for a 6-12 month time horizon.

According to unusual whales it is

tsla is trash
Up 3% what in the god damn autism are you try to fucking say
All that shit for a 350p?   


you could have just said markets are ATH and due for a pullback lol
That is why EVs are so hot right now, lol
I‚Äôve always wondered what they would do if you got restricted again.
PLTR GOGOGO
not when scalpers going bonkers
I was expecting a slight pull back and was hoping for 10% profit
This
Bad move...they CRUSHED earnings
I hope it pulls a NIO, lasts until EOY
I know WSB is autistic but 700 naked puts at $10 for a stock like PLTR?
Yeah I recommend it. It got beaten down hard and is massively oversold IMO. I bought in EOD yesterday and it's going well so far.

The one mil share wall was on the ask on PLTR at around $20. At least it was yesterday when I last looked at L2. I assumed that‚Äôs what you were referring to.

EDIt: shit, realized I responded to the wrong comment earlier. My bad
Buy puts when it hits 60. Just give me my 50c and we‚Äôll be fine retard. Godspeed
PLTR $20 tomorrow.
Load up on SPY $365C 11/25. 

Don't ask why, just do it.
Well, IDK about money you pulled out of your account but anyone can chart TSLA and see that it's about where it was at the end of August.
I got back in at $43, I'm loving today

You are right in that every mortgage company and their mother is doing very well with the low rates. Difference in RKT is their brand, technology and disruption in the mortgage market space. They have more opportunity to take a larger share of the pie than their competition and have lower costs. This creates opportunity IMO.

And yes I hold RKT shares.
Just gonna say it, I think SOLO is gonna be a big flop. Those cars are rolling deathtraps, imagine hitting a deer in one of those tiny things? Or getting T boned? You are 100% fucked, and they are also just ugly as fucking hell.
Is PLTR a daily meme or weekly?
All in C**C

I know. So just wait until SPY is bigly green and this shit will be humongous green

thats a long time lol, but i bet its gradual and rewarding...i have a massive loss this year as well, i need to make it back lmao i think im converting to theta gang
SPY and EV have no correlation what so ever
I only think this because it'd be good for my positions, BUT most of us who are bullish on GME think a major squeeze is coming any day
BLNK seriously gonna close above 19.
Nice.

This is my dilemma
So do we hold or dump here?
For real though, gotta be NIO puts if it pushes $60 right?
It‚Äôs an undervalued company you retard. People and institutions are buying them up omg how much retarded can you be.
tell me when to buy puts
$AAPL, move over $120 already. I‚Äôm licking my lips right now on some fat covered call premium.

$TNA, move your sorry ass over $51 so I can get assigned. I want these shares off my books.
pltr is the next pltr retard
Fuckn SOLO I had some too until I did the responsible thing and actually looked at their product. Oof
Can nio keep growing holy shit
fucking solo
I bought this shit back in Feb. before you even knew what a corona virus was. I made tons more in March but I played the crash from the beginning.

of course I was a doomer. Though all the retards stocked up on TP for some reason.
Today‚Äôs been a doozy for me
What the fuck? How ? Why?
PLTR CRSR 40 EOM AND BABA 300 EOM
USSA.
AYRO 05/21 7.50C
Chill. We need small growth not another meme run.
The fact the market has pretty much returned to normal is completely bonkers. Nothing makes sense anymore, but it won‚Äôt be all sunshine and rainbows forever.
Inversed yolo tech calls
No real reason, this is the first day i have seen a generally bullish order flow here when that didn't necessarily need to be the case today and especially over the past few days where BABA should have run up... For what its worth i have had an very lucky streak this week with my plays...
Can't you still sell?  you just cant buy I thought
shark tank unfiltered be like
Im like the guy with the yellow jacket rubbing his hands, licking his lips hiding behind a tree watching other tickers not mentioned here mooning
This was the reason I was skeptical of them. That along with the fact I own a shit ton of their hardware. Absolutely love their product but the app has gone to absolute shit. If I were a new customer I would return that shit asap and buy something else. Made me hold off pulling the trigger on their stock. I thought they would stay flat. I guess that's why I'm a fucking stonk retard and not an autistic!
Throw in free maple syrup and healthcare and I'm in!
>Thats good advice. From now on listen to your mom lol.
What you don't seem to get is that the Fed \*is indirectly\* printing money. By lowering the interest rates, they increase the bonds value and therefore collateral. Funds have to rebalance their portfolios and buy stonks.
I‚Äôm sucking myself off to pltr

We're probably in for a last hurrah during Christmas if somehow people are still not broke enough to not buy presents

Closing the APP and fapping for the next 43 mins.

The Tendies were out of stock.
Is there a way to check current day trading status on RH
It can't go up forever can it?
Stimulus is paid for by the Treasury. The Treasury doesn't have that kind of money sitting around so it issues debt as bonds. A lot of the bonds are bought by the Fed printing money. They currently own trillions of dollars worth.
In Thiel we trust. Please fund my MBA with PLTR gains.
Currently in PLTR and NIO true memes. What else should I be in?
my AYRO call is at +4700% today, but i only bought one so it's $35. Welcome to the CLUB
NIO $50 close today, $60 tomorrow, $69 open on Monday
No dollars is weak by each year,  that's why with also money printing we saw this huge rally in many stocks
Pumping all EVs is the next new thing apparently.

I hold weeklies for at least a full trading day,

Monthlies. 7-10 days.

Leaps- sell and roll out and up 5-10% if it hits over 50% return. 

This is after months of paper handing.

Even if you lose- teaching yourself patience will pay off immensely in long run
For pfizer, the answer is always yes.
because the moon isn‚Äôt real
Blinky!
Is JMIA just a pump and dump?
PLTR 19 EOD. Come on!

I have a 2020 ecoboost mustang right now. Super fun to drive but I actually just moved from the suburbs to the city kind of unexpectedly due to my job so it‚Äôs now me and gfs only car and kind of impractical in the city. Also I can‚Äôt take it for joy rides as easily. 

Considering just taking the 4-5k L on it and just leasing a Mercedes GLB or something. Lease so I can scratch my car itch without having to worry about commitment haha
Had a 400% month. God I love options sometimes.

XPEV just had a huge day

Funny that people bitch about stimulus when the market is at ATH.  Shows how far this market is going to crash eventually.  Stimulus is in fact needed and it is the market that is retarded.

Guys, it's fake. Let's start with the obvious - the S&P 500 Index is up around 9.7% YTD, not 2.77%. Am I the only retard here who spotted this?
same fucking thing here, i typed in my address and was at payment info, but then walmart told me out of stock.
Can‚Äôt stop, won‚Äôt stop, GameStop, Moonshot
$KISS - lick it up
I'm not gonna do that, on the basis that it would reveal to her that I have paid absolutely no attention to her every other time that she's recommended books to me.

What I do know is that she says to read the front page of the paper, never just the business section. Because you're never gonna get one up on the market by doing the things that the market says to do. You have to learn what you can about the world, and then square your investments with your understanding. You can read the financial works to get lots of ideas, but filter them through the prism of your own knowledge and experience.
Euh guys there this hot new stock in town called "PLTR" its a funny LotR meme  


ima need u to purchase it so it hits $19
[deleted]
Why would you bet against the CIA
Some salty fuckers round here
Bought SPY calls strictly because it makes the least amount of sense tbh
Even SOLO...
No, idc about everyone else buying calls. But the day I read about you buying calls, it will actually be interesting.
[deleted]
damn man, its coming back tho
so fuckin dumb we've had a stimulus teased for like 6 months now and the market keeps thinking it'll finally play out THIS time? rip my damn puts

Seems like you should've just hopped on the train at the station instead of jumping on after it left already.
Luck or are they being restocked already?
Good input. As long as the equity grows im happy. If one expires worthless it'll kill a good chunk of the gains.

cause he probably is pushing these positions at their behest
Yea imma just hold out however long that takes. Could be years. Lucky I bought shares and not options.
yep some random dude telling you that the market will eventually pull back at some point. No shit.
we're going back to 360 aren't we. the only plays to make in this environment are day trades....and i'm all out

fuck

$CRSR I should take some profits...
Dude that's not the most ideal $400 bet, assuming you bought at $8 a contract. You could have venmo'd me half of that instead, the loss is significantly less and it's also an even more retarded thing to do with your money.
I have no gauge on what it may hit. Nobody rly knows, maybe 300-400

Canadian banks are steadily gaining 0.1-0.9% per day and heading back to their pre-pandemic highs without resistance. Either buy shares to capture growth and dividends (~5%) or buy OTM calls X days out at ($Price + $X/2).

No.

PLTR gonna break through $19 by EOD
Anyone playing SDC?
ever worry this is the top for 10 years?
I think their is a very simple solution but it‚Äôs going to cause a lot of short term pain. Problem is wealth inequality yes, but it‚Äôs mainly driven by poor/inefficient capital allocation - money invested isn‚Äôt trickling to benefit consumers and employees. IMO there‚Äôs 2 solutions: 1. Raise federal minimum wages to stimulate long term economic growth. 2. Start taxing the shit out of FD‚Äôs  to siphon money directly into taxpayer hands. 

Neither of these have a benefit in the short run because of how companies are structured but long term it will help fix things quite a bit.
Well put, man. I‚Äôm not sure why you are in mid-range puts when laying out such macro conditions which could well extend beyond the holiday to materialize, but otherwise this is my position entirely. I have $SPXU building now for the long haul dump; $SPY topping puts to follow out through Q1

They won't listen
Gordon's an assclown when it comes to TSLA. He's a great gay bear on pretty much everything so I got curious about what he does recommend and one of his buy recommendations is CSIQ - Canadian Solar. Wouldn't have found this baby if not for Gordon so thanks..I guess?
But $CIIC
no way.. swing trading tesla puts has kept me floating today.
If America turns into Ameripoor with stimulus talks pushing into 2021 then stocks like DG (Dollar General) will probably do well since people are just scraping by until Uncle Sam's dollars arrive
most likely
In functionality android beats apple no problem, same goes for their stores in my opinion. Plus android is trying to improve their brand and their looks, while apple is regressing with their removal of the headphone Jack and their constantly changing power cord. But apple does beat android in market because it has a considerably better User interface and a better User experience
Lol that background/environment is one of the free Unreal Engine assets from a few months back.
NIO!
Everything is blood green, stupid as fuck. All because some cunt made some bullshit up about stimulus talks being back on the table. Dude NYC is on lockdown and restaurants won‚Äôt have indoor dining. I‚Äôm so, so mad right now I swer
Why would I post when I buy calls?

Stocks going up is the norm, and the fact that everyone spams about having calls, like it's interesting, is one of the many reasons this sub sucks ass
Nobody is laughing at NIO now huhh suck my dick NIO bears I literally begged this chat to buy the dip at $42 not once, but Fucking 3 times
Pullback max to 13 or 14? Imagine the room growth now,

While everyone keeps dick sucking NIO and TSLA, SBE is flying under the radar and starting to get noticed. SBE has been up almost 40% this week. The merger is expected to close before the end of Q4. I currently have 93 share @ average cost of $18.29 and $30c Exp. 2/19/21.

I hear what you're saying. But the world cannot handle an economy crash, it's just impossible in this day and age. Maybe we could use some old notions to track the future, it's just economy is being defined as we're living now. We've already survived the slope and we were expecting  a crash at 240, 260, 280, 300, 330, 340, 350... I think it's a distant memory that crash will occur and we're probably about to see 400 soon because COVID might have gave everyone a lesson that the world could literally  stop functioning in a day so YOLO. Anyways no one knows, yet to be seen..

US has no EV market except California
Great, thanks. Few more questions: why was there such a massive sell-off? Almost 70% of float held by institutions so how comes its being kept so low? And lastly the $1 billion share buyback should increase share price, no?

Bill Ackman is bullish on stocks for 2021, but has a hedge position for a ‚Äòtragic‚Äô end to 2020

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who made big money betting against the markets earlier this year, said he‚Äôs optimistic about a recovery in 2021, but investors will need to get through a ‚Äútragic‚Äù year-end first.

Do think cutting your flowers to water your weeds applies to options? 

I have Z, FB and BABA calls and when one is up big I sell it and buy more of the one that's down. EX) sold 1 Z110 to buy 3 FB300. Trading back and forth I've added like 20% more contracts by doing this. I believe all of them will be in the money by expiration so I feel confident in it. Anyone else do this too?

How can you just write off the vaccine news as fumes.  We have two vaccines that are 95% effective and will be out in the spring to at least the high risk people.

So is DKNG dead - or still a meme?
When I was a wee retard about 25 years ago my parents didn't know shit about investing or managing their money. Someone at my mom's job got them all talking about investing in real estate, and brought up this big empty amount of land in the state. They were talking about all throwing their money in and how someone who knew someone said it was going to blow up and get quickly developed.

So my parents drop around $60k into a plot of land, without ever having laid eyes on it.

Two years after their investment, we drive out to it. It's what you'd expect--a small road through overgrown woods. On the way back we cross over a small bridge that crosses over a canal, and I look out the window.

There's a fucking nuclear power plant not 5 miles away.

To this day, the best offer they got was around $15k from the power company who wanted to build pylons on the plot. They're holding it still. They're in their 70s now.

Retard investing is multigenerational I guess

Oh I could have told you that. Every 3 months I stuff 10 grand into $VOO like the pussy I am, and put on the clown makeup for when I lose $500 within the next week and have a negative ROI for the next 7 weeks, until I start feeling bullish again and put in another 10k

My parents are about fifty years older than me too. My mom is from the war-torn country of Philadephia, and my father is from the Soviet Bloc country called New York City. They both stopped attending school after finishing their post-graduate degrees.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that they are both brilliant people, and were I an actually dutiful son, I would go after everything they know with a goddamn spoon. I am incredibly fortunate to be their kid, and it makes me sad to know that other people won't have the same opportunities that that affords. But, once I start making ultra-phat PhD-in-Machine-Learning bucks, I'm gonna be donating plenty.

I love Fridays like this
1.) the timing has been building to this point for a long time.  Seriously, these ducks want to make money, they could probably get a better deal with trump than Biden.  They would want to pimp it for cash it ASAP (which I assume that motivation surpasses all moral or political motivations) 


2.) In most of the announcements, I saw PFE state it was greater than 90% effective.  90% is a hell of a good number for vaccine.  They probably thought that was a really impressive number (it is).  Also, they probably figured that if they said it was ‚Äú97% effective‚Äù but then the real/final numbers came in at 95% effective, the media would crucify them.  All the media & conspiracy theorists & anti-Vaxers would never shut up about how they ‚Äúover stated effectiveness‚Äù and ‚Äúlied about protection‚Äù blah blah blah.  So it‚Äôs reasonable to assume they understated their original numbers by a tad (they weren‚Äôt final yet). 



3.) It‚Äôs easy to manipulate small changes in numbers.  I‚Äôm an expert in pharmaceutical & medical trial protocols.  You can‚Äôt change your core measures, or end outcomes, or initial exclusion/inclusion criteria without huge blowback from the community. But you can tweak or alter subtle standards to make the final results more (or less) confident. 



4.) It‚Äôs not crazy that mRNA is all happening at the same time- it‚Äôs obviously not a preferred method (have you seen the storage requirements?!).  But it‚Äôs easier to mass produce faster.  This vaccine is both very urgent in terms of health, and in terms of the money tied to it (if 50% of people have had covid by the time it‚Äôs released, they could lose 50% of their market).  So they would rather lose doses and/or effectiveness based on the logistic issues than be second to market or too late to the pandemic


5.) Do I think PFE & Moderna told their nerds to find new ways to interpret the data to beat each other? Hell yes.  
Does (90 vs 95 vs 94.5%) make a clinical difference? Probably not when you account for real world scenarios.
BA fucking die

yea. the economy is good for the economy, policy will effect it obviously but we're gonna keep chugging.

I have a problem with the progressive left's solution to many of our current economic problems impacting markets, such as wealth inequality.

I dont know what the solution is, but I hoenstly think people like AOC are idiots when explaining the solutions to these issues (and it shows, not a single bill she had got passed) . Its such a nuanced thing. but what do i know... i like she points out the problem though. but you can really tell she doesnt know what shes talking about when it comes to solutions.

Do you think with the Georgia runoff happening soon Pelosi might agree to Mitch‚Äôs terms on this stimulus deal?

Same on 15P 12/31, keep on holding on buddy
what does that mean? first stage?
I agree with this analysis. My first trip to China was about 7 years ago. Local branded cars were very basic and with terrible designs. Recently they have some really competitive cars. Rafik Ferrag the lead designer is French and has worked at PSA and Honda. Xpeng are not scared to admit that automotive talent doesn‚Äôt always have to come from within China. 

With a huge market on their doorstep, these companies don‚Äôt have to worry too much about exports to succeed. One thing is quite certain, once the government realise there are enough home grown EV manufacturers within China, they will ramp up the restrictions on ICE vehicles sharply in order to kill the competition.

I've been in AMD. NET is interesting. I hadn't looked at it. I might do the same as you.
If you believe this stock is going to jump to $45 EOY, youre nuts. While rocket is a good company, they haven't proven themselves in the investing world. This stock is cyclical and dependant on multiple factors, all of which could go to shit whenever the FED makes a move or a bubble bursts. Rocket is making the correct moves into auto loans, but yet again, that's even a bigger competitor market and not sure how they'll compete.

Great company, not so great stock. It will grow, but at a slow rate. The real company to buy into if we're speaking of mortgage loans is United Shore, whenever they make the IPO happen.

@op this analysis seems pretty spot on, however, i believe it‚Äôs dependent on Biden not being able to pass a multi trillion stimulus bill, and the moderna and Pfizer vaccines not being implemented in the next few months.  If one or both of these things happen, the market should avoid a crash.

Low volume pump means sour hour is upon you.
All 4 will print. Wait and see.
The current recession was able to be determined by many factors including the inverted yield rates becoming displaced on Treasury Bonds short term interest rates more preferable than long term rates, one of thousands of complex indications of the financial markets entering a recession. At this point in time FFRs for banks are going to be reduced in the long term even turning negative as some economist warn uncertainty is only going to grow, not nearly as bad as feb-march collapse, i believe you entered this position too early, as Q4 is not only the last stand for nearly all market sectors to move i expect new record highs before hitting record lows you have placed a lot of DD on legitimately reasonable data, but failed to understand a reason or rhyme with this market in general is not there you will open up that positions door to find yourself with a margin call i doubt you have the will commitment or diamond hands to hold that position for two weeks.

The offering that everyone with puts was cheering about was to close out debt and is priced at 17.59.  

So basically they are saying if you give up 6% guaranteed interest bonds you can have shares at 17.59.  

If bond holders accept it, there is dilution yes, but the trade off is less debt and more importantly less interest on the debt.  

Dilution for cash is really bad, dilution to pay off debt isn‚Äôt the same.

It‚Äôs usually more beneficial to not throw your emotions on the table when unprompted. That‚Äôs the joke. 

Also, as your two assumptions about me seem to clash against each other - that I‚Äôm both doing well from Biden winning, and simultaneously in a position where I need the govt to sponsor me, I‚Äôll clarify that I‚Äôm doing, frankly, great financially. Since before corona.

Just because I didn‚Äôt vote for ‚Äúflood the markets with QE‚Äù Trump, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a total degenerate :) it also doesn‚Äôt mean I voted for Biden

So check this out. As some of you know, I got distracted and made the dumb mistake of purchasing Dunkn' Donuts instead of DraftKings (DNKN vs DKNG) this morning. So I started looking into what was going on with Dunkn' Donuts ever since the proposed takeover/buyout at $106 by Inspire Brands. Turns out lawsuits have been filed questioning whether the consideration and the process that led to the deal are adequate, or whether the consideration undervalues the Company. 

In short, there is a chance this deal may fall through. And guess what? $110 calls even 1 or 2 years out are dirt cheap...like a nickel or a dime. 

From the looks of it, this deal closing out is already delayed and even a small issue could send this to the toilet meaning DNKN can continue its already meteoric rise well above its current $106 plateau in the coming months.

I dunno, but those cheap call options seem like a nice bet right now. Let me know if you think I'm crazy.

Happy trading.

I think it goes one of two ways. Either people leverage their asses, and consumer market does well enough to cause hope. Or, consumer market is abysmal, and there is no hope.

man i missed playing pokemon emerald/saphire etc..

any games like that i can still play?
That makes sense, if this gets moved I'll probably start taking my autism there or to ThetaGang.  Thought it couldn't hurt to post this here.  Figured RKT is a "meme" stock.  Will consider in future though, and thanks for not being an ass hole, it is appreciated (although probably warranted).

I'm not doing much the next few days, off through Thanksgiving.  Will look into horizontal comparisons of RKT to other lenders to include banks and non banks.  Not included in the DD is the dramatic shift from banks as originators and holders of mortgages to non financial institutions.
i will!
Damn bruh lemme see the gain porn u made now... I‚Äôm waiting on my Venmo/cashapp

Stimmy talks back in play. this is what tanked the market yesterday. It‚Äôs what will bring it back up today.
Green Thursdays are usually bearish but I don‚Äôt even know anymore. Just keep buying the dip I suppose.
WTF?  ZM is dead again?
depends on which side of the civil war you plan to be on
TSLA is on Theta burn mode. All FD's are fucked.

Double top on GME, get ready to pull back
They will print don‚Äôt worry
Already in
I like XPEV long term over the others because they are actually making their own cars in their own factories which they have built in record time, spend about 40% of budget Into R&D, and as you can see are making nicer level cars (P7) as well as introducing a mass market car. Compared to just (literally) stealing tesla's tech, they look like they are trying to copy the formula for what makes tesla so strong In the largest EV market in the world. With gov backing no less
nothing except for the fact I'm 1k poorer
AAPL is a savings account now. Don't buy in hopes that it will move anymore fast.
Not unless you're a holder of the company that is being acquired. But since ChargePoint is not listed for public trading, until the merging, so there's nothing to worry about.
You sweatin
Good shit, look at my post history, I did the same too. It's always good to gamble your money on advice from strangers
WTF is invest? I only Gamble
70% down on Jan 300c...don't think I'm gonna break even on it
SPY going to open tomorrow at 360, ramp to 363 and close 360. This is the way to kill VIX to sub 20 finally.
I actually think its more likely people will buy TSLA stock with their stimmy which is even more bullish lol
AYRO is up 50% today. No news. No headway. It‚Äôs completely fucked and I know I‚Äôm going to kick myself later for not selling.

Sure, but you‚Äôre forgetting record unemployment and no stimulus ‚Äî you have significantly less consumers along with less shopping in cities with lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.

Not my thing either.  But it's pretty much the opposite of buying shares low and selling high, but most people don't necessarily dump shares at a loss if they plan on holding long anyway.

lockdowns are bullish, means another stimmy and more robinhood liquidity
Vaccine hopes are all used up.

Rotation back to stimulus hopes.
Its okay. NIO was shit back then. Hindsight 20/20. But you fucked up.
Lol
This post explains why I am right and then ends by saying "you are wrong." It's bizarre.

\> Suppose we buy ¬£1 million of government bonds from a pension fund. In place of the bonds, the pension fund now has ¬£1 million in money.

This is incorrect, the fund now has reserves.

\> Money has entered the real economy in the shape of unemployment protection payments and direct stimulus checks. 

That is fiscal policy, not fed policy, and has nothing to do with QE.

Is PLNT a soy based software program?
market manipulation is so gd obvious. Any hint of the market going down we get VACCINE 90% EFFECTIVE. Then VACCINE 95% EFFECTIVE! then OH OUR VACCINE IS NOW 95% EFFECTIVE TOO!. Then, "were running out of vaccine news" OH STIMULUS TALKS BACK ON THE TABLE!!
All depends on next weeks unemployment numbers. See if this week's increase was a precursor or if it was just a random jump
In my opinion, OPs scenario will kick in, if vaccine trials are unsuccessful or rejected by FDA. Market will then turn to shit. If successful/approved: üöÄ 
So he is correct, that we will now in 4-6 weeks...
Might as well speak spanish

Nvm.
Yeah I was told that I was virtually immune for at least 12 weeks.  Had it like 8 weeks ago.  Few symptoms then.

I'm hearing that if you are asymptomatic the first time, then you may not have built up much immunity.  This time there are more symptoms for sure.

Ahhhhh.  I remember when back to back 3%+ movement called for celebration.  


Now we‚Äôre used to 5-10% days and constant rocket ships.
It looks like the floor on this is higher than I'd expected, so holding for now. Will sell if it pumps hard again and rebuy on the inevitable dip. I don't see this mooning until they start to roll out their EV tech next year, unless there's some major news.

ebay $60 1/15/21 c - 3 month all time low, easy holiday seasons money

niu 12/18 c - ev scooters, more popular in eastern countries & metropolitan areas. hasn't super boomed yet like nio. also close to niu. earnings report soon, going to crush. we can see their daily active riders which ties heavily to sales and its looking good for the earnings report

pfe 12/18 c - people sold off from moderna news, so i bought some calls because they're gonna be buying vaccines from every company to meet demand for 8 billion people. both are 95%+ effective, though moderna can store in normal fridge temps
290c is nowhere near degenerate enough to be called an FD foh

It happens every several years. Think mobile computing (Apple/Google) back in late 2000s, semiconductors/payments in mid 2010s. Ecommerce wins of today (Amazon/SHOP/etc...) are a culmination of a decade of work and investment by those companies + suddenly favorable environment where their competitors got destroyed. What's next?
Well, I‚Äôm out for today.  I had some SQQQ calls, but this market makes no damn sense.  Mass lockdowns, pandemic, record unemployment, and spy pumps.

Calling it right now we're getting a cheeto tweet that dumps it
/\ forever
Expect an overnight pump of 1% and all your 11/20 +/- 2% or greater options to expire worthless tomorrow.
just went in on TSLA 600c 12/24
Not being  a dick - before you loose bunch of money, just do a 10 min research on SPAC.
It's bound to hit pre-citron highs sooner or later, may reject it but I know shareholders are curious enough to hold to at least $50. Should be natural resistance there.
‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù
You cracked the SPY run you win!
Most bears are probably dead at this point. Whoever is still short is just insane lol. Were at ath doubt many shorts are still holding out here.
Positions?
Yeah holding until then, then I‚Äôll sell some to for taxes.
Going to talk about talking about stimulus again. Feels like a done deal to me gonna go ahead and spend that $1200.
SPY you don‚Äôt have to do this..
RIP in peace sweet prince
We love your mom OP
I bought the same yesterday as lotto tickets, SPY gonna open at 365 tmrw

Why the fuck did I buy TSLA puts this morning... Fuck I hate money. Mercy Elon please sell

What expiration
pltr
hmmm thinking about puts here...
uh wat NIO is limp like the bizkit..
that's quite the jackpot. You probably didn't have to pay taxes on them either.
Tesla ain't buying this pump
Because there's a lot of greater fools around to distribute the weight of the bag holders. If RobinTrack still worked you could see how many idiots are currently holding just on that platform.
5 $12.5 contracts and 3 $10 contracts
Someone here bought a lot of puts for this to happen.

If I had $13c I‚Äôd think about diamond hands but I need a 20% day just to break even and a 15% to expire ITM with my $15c
Big balls
PLTR lookin strong as shit this week
I hold both, to the moon!
So you know how you sell puts at a loss?  They shorted actually shares. So they borrowed shares to sell and were expecting to buy back cheaper to profit.  But if it doesn‚Äôt go lower they need to buy back at a higher price at a loss creating more buying driving the price up.  Can‚Äôt sit by and watch the price keep going up without buying them back or else it‚Äôs just a larger loss. So a squeeze sometimes happens quick when a fuckload of shorts have to be covered.
I've been so uncertain on any plays
Cry yourself to sleep knowing it was only 2 contracts bro
Brick and mortar hard copy game stores are the future
We are going to get good vaccine news AMC. EUA for PFE or some shit.
Quick give me a play. Gonna close my cash secured NIO puts I wrote so I‚Äôll have 4.5k in capital freed up to yolo
Lmao yeah I just woke up missed almost all the trading day don‚Äôt mind me
Same boat here. Except I went all in. Nothing left to purchase puts
Wow
Dontchu know pump it upppp

Wtf happening to spy?
Love the company, 80-90 eoy ATLEAST
How is +5% flat you fucking idiot? Sure it's not mooning as much as XPeng...but still.
What news did this? Reopening mooning
I know the market is supposed to be forward looking but holy fuck how far are we looking
Did we just bomb Corona? America #1
Bought BLNK 12/18 yesterday and 1/15 today, sold some calls today for guaranteed profit. Cant decide if I want to sell more now or risk holding until tomorrow/next week
dont stop QQQ, lol bought some 290FDs rofl.. printing 100%
You made me do the same with the 5k I‚Äôm not YOLOing on NIO
**BABA IS BACK HAHAHA DUCK YOU WINNIE THE POOH**
Volume on NIO and TSLA is insane üöÄüöÄ
Cause someone posted a bear DD post and it hit the front page.
Why bynd
It's your choice. ITM = Less free money vs. OTM = More free money.
I too want these things
Buy any option that is OP (i.e 10 call on a 10.65 stock for .64)

Sell far far otm calls

Sell puts on spy

Don‚Äôt ever buy a weekly option

Don‚Äôt go short over a long term
Because it pumped this early it‚Äôs gonna be a blood bath near market close with profit taking
Huge TSLA squeeze tomorrow?
imagine selling for a lost because u listened to the gay bear andrew.
Like shit sometimes. 10% is my max, but the positions need to speak to me. So I'm usually on LSD.
I hate that I‚Äôm an adult gambling on GME, HYLN, RUN and more. What happened to my life?!?
Buy right before it crashes, sell at the first hint of an upturn, right before it moons.

^seriously.
I'm only going to say this one more time, CVS is going to make a bigly announcement before the end of the month. This is your last chance to get in
The printer always goes brrrr. don't know what the fuck you going on about
ZM really fucking me.
Chadsdaq bout to bust through 12 again
Do you think Palantir knows if you own shares so in their spy database they flag you as cool? Or is it gamefied like this dude owns one way OTM call so he's alright, this dude owns puts so he's a terrorist, this dude YOLO'd his life savings so he's super cool...
This shit spiking cause Schumer said COVID talks back on the table. 

Spoiler: they aren't but any BS will pump

I had 120 bitcoins in 2012.

I found a facebook status of mine, laughing at the time I sold 20 bitcoins to someone in a starbucks through localbitcoins.com for a total of $250.
It‚Äôs got better numbers in China. Not as scaleable as NIO, but solid Chinese EV with proven sales

FUCK TESLA OMG
Buy low and sell low. Double negative equals a positive.
We‚Äôre due for an orange man tweet that ruins everything soon
I literally sold SOLO to get RIDE calls yesterday ü§°ü§°ü§°
Pump me baby üí¶üí¶üí¶
thanks for saying this. i was getting worried.
Everyone: There's no way the market can keep going up with the world on fire

Stonks: WITNESSSSS MEEEEEE
money controls the mind so easily its scary
LMAO but actually tho
Earlier this week picked up PLTR Feb 19 $24 calls and a Jan 2022 $30 call on a dip. LETS GO Tendies are on the menu
Bears r so fuk
Stock markets in turmoil!!!
So when the fuck is the 20% tank happening? Oh wait, you have no fucking idea. Have fun selling all your shit right now, especially when half the market is still in the dumps. 

You are basically outing yourself as a retard who only pays attention to meme stocks and tech by saying ‚Äúmarket is overvalued‚Äù
I'll make it simple for your little retard brain. 
1. Stonks only go up
2. Printer go brrrr
3. Only buy options on stocks already up 20%
I love these pumps, they just blew my asshole out
XEL is free money at this level
I don't understand it. I'm dumb sure, but it's really fucking weird.
2:30pm pump is the new 2:30am pump
80 mins, no?
Rug pull incoming
My SNAP calls are up 134%, but I can't sell then because of PDT restrictions... Wonder if I should by puts to hedge them.
oh look, stimulus hopes are back on the menu

Mom boyfriend told me
good plan, thanks
Ok boomer..

Might be good play with new consoles coming out.
Spy is the most complicated thing ever
why is that?
No, I suppose it doesn't.
What changed? What made the market go from hover to massive green dildo? I am searching all the news stations and can't find diddly shit.
I have a few 13c 11/20 that I paid .41 for. Diamond handing this bitch for sure.
Yo
Investors lookin into it since they‚Äôre going EV now
I'm going to laugh all the way to the bank if my SPY 11/20 $360 calls don't expire worthless tomorrow.
Ive been rolling a few SPY puts a month out

Every monday i sell it at a loss and update it to a different price, and put the expiration date a week further out. 

Today i sold at the bottom and bought 1DTE calls with the profits

Gonna ride it to 360, sell them, and reopen a month out put

Easy money with good timing, and the advantage of holding a monthly put is when the inevitable crash finally happens im going to tendie town
Could help but notice the Kodak hat. Probably still sore from the beating he took on that one
LOL HAHHA FUCK so much volume and not even EOD hahhah fuck RIP Bears
TSLA 515 EOD
I sold SOLO to get RIDE calls yesterday ü§°ü§°ü§°

I think once the stimulus comes out people freak out over money printing and load up on metals. Also used in solar roofs so bullish for the upcoming years. Idk if that info is useful for the weekly call people lol.
[removed]
IMAGINE IF BUFFET ACTUALLY WASN'T INVESTING INTO TESLA BUT RATHER PLTR... THE TENDIES
Aye. Either case is bullish. Too much uncertainty is gone now. We slow grind up nows.
that's why he has to sell his house to buy puts he has no cash left
Bull traps 100%
not too familiar with etsy pre and post being added but tsla up 22% in 3 days.
I warn u one more time get some FISV calls dingbats.  

FISV 105c 1/21
Hey I got a tip that the 5 major companies that control 90% of the cardboard market is announcing a $50/ton increase on liner and medium (main components in boxes). Supposedly official in Pulp and Paper tomorrow afternoon. 

Not sure how this will effect $ip but just a hot tip
Bank reserves aren‚Äôt only used to lend against. Reserves for example, are also used to settle transactions between fed member banks.

Also, when the fed credits a bank‚Äôs reserves, they aren‚Äôt stuck there, as maybe it‚Äôs unintentionally implied by OP. Banks in the US are generally subject to a reserve ratio requirement. That requirement is currently zero, like most of the world. 

Banks will still keep reserves for multiple purposes, as reserves aren‚Äôt subject to strict capital requirements like other assets, but it‚Äôs wrong to assume that when the fed credits a bank‚Äôs reserve account that money is stuck there. 

Also, give that Bank of England article a read. That is how money is created, as opposed to the Econ 101 version of the money multiplier with reserves.
I think I will inverse you, NotGucci
Thanks for clarifying. What I meant
CCL 16.5P 11/27
Sold my SPY 360c like an idiot this morning. Bought a 354p expiring tomorrow

Pump me daddy!
As of 10/31/2020. Does that not even include the massive gains from this week?
How the fuck could there be any bears left. They broke snd can‚Äôt even be bear anymore
Hey man you got anything to say today?? Oh wait me and my tendies are too busy fucking your mom, give me a minute. Don‚Äôt worry daddy has your allowance right next to my fucking Tesla #Nerd
Power hour gonna be up bigly over this fail Guilliani coup
I made $20K in March which is a lot of money for me. I withdrew $15,000 and haven‚Äôt touched it since.

Last year I made $10,000 on AMD and lost every dollar of it overnight....not to mention TLRY was one of my first trades ever like three years ago and i lost thousands to them lol. So i learned my lesson

I‚Äôve already missed out on $2500 today with Tesla but whatever. I keep turning like $250 into $2500 dollars every month
If someone has a short, and the short doesn‚Äôt work out by the date that it expires the person who owns a short has to buy shares of the stock to cover for the short, so when there‚Äôs a ton of shorts and the stock doesn‚Äôt fall, you get a short squeeze when a large quantity of shares has to be bought, and that‚Äôll drive a stocks price up.


At least that‚Äôs my understanding of it, could be completely wrong cause I‚Äôm retarded who knows
His real middle name is unreadable to humans. All hail our God-Emperor.
Smells like a rug pull incoming
It‚Äôs very unlikely that ‚ÄúBuffett‚Äù is buying TSLA but as he and Munger have more or less handed off the reins, it‚Äôs possible that BRK is buying
I open robinhood so much that I recognize each stock not by the ticker but by the shape of its mini price chart
Wow that is a pump
great question
good bot
Patience. Not the time to buy yet
No one cares what George Soros has to say, ur lament about buying doesn‚Äôt mean shit to me
really, ugh
It‚Äôs when shorts cover !!
I'm buying another 20k in Dec 18 spy puts. On sale rn
Might‚Äôve just bottomed. Might go to $21. It‚Äôs a bitch to trade.
Yes daddy SPY, I love it when you rip my face off!
I don‚Äôt even understand
man gains really start picking up the pace when your portfolio crosses 100k. 

Every 1% gain is a grand. 

200k is going to come a shit ton faster than I thought.
Spy is at .4% u donut
I don't think TSLA is going run-up to close.
TTCF is a great company and is competitively valued compared to BYND and others in the industry.  Good call!
SHOP time, WFH comeback, at least thru Jan.
If Cohen buys, GameStop will thrive long term. He wants to switch them to more tech based. He will do the same thing he did with Chewy. GameStop has a lot of potential, just current management isn‚Äôt taking advantage of it
CVS go vertical baby

Oh so they're selling short shares, as opposed to Puts
How about looking at the stocks PE ratio compared to other financing institutions that are publically traded? Looking at PE and it‚Äôa EPS... shows it‚Äôs severely undervalued at this current price.
Never too late. It's actually a good company. There's a lot of pump and dumps recently but PLTR isn't one of them.
I'm in VXX long term, but not sure if it's worth the theta burn. It's pretty much insurance
I like your style. Sounds fun let‚Äôs do it
How much less fun is tsla going to be once it‚Äôs in the sp500?
More then we should, lol
Just waiting for Nio to hit $55 so I can cash these calls out pls

PLTR CRSR 50 EOD BABA 300 EOM PLEASE
Why is GME running up?
They have a huge online catalog.
Thats when monthly options expire. Sometimes we go big uppies sometimes big downies sometime very flatsies
LOL. I am a weak man. Sold it at 105.5 this morning. It was an easy trading day for 10 minutes of fluctuations. Now bought back in at 104.44 again.
LOL SPY vertical rofl... 360 EOD
No one knows its confidential in the filing so its all speculation
how would I have money if I was always bearish
[deleted]
cuz market is autistic
We are the stock market üòé
so like how much volume does WSB actually influence, is there actual data on this
Is there going to be a rug pull like yesterday?
Sometimes I feel like a true degenerate being on this sub so much. But then I remember that there‚Äôs a sub called r/girlfartstories and there‚Äôs currently 60 dudes on there jacking off to stories of girls farting in their face. I feel better about myself
Whatcha selling?
Gewd my calls need it. About -85% on leaps, going to need Apple at like 140 by December lol
My dream is to make it big like you and retire to barbados
This is the way
And yet half the retards on Reddit were busy selling all their stocks on March 20th because ‚Äúwe have a long way down‚Äù
Jan 21 2022 2.5C, bought for 1.75
full meme market
So. why we pumping?
357p anyone?
R8 ?
They are literally at the end of the post. Are you people blind?
Like you got enough money to push the stock upwards?
I love Albertsons (ACI).  Nice and steady gains, no stress.
Buffet buying into tesla?  Heard about this? Anyone know?
Fuck your asshole... I may lose 90% of my portfolio but you better believe at least one of these puts will print. You also better believe it will be $NIO
I was kind of in a different world in March. I was up 120k then just literally gambled it down to 45k. It just set in how much I could fucking use that 75k right now lol
lol, glad I didn't make that mistake. SOLO was the move yesterday.
Aren‚Äôt you always bearish?
Nasdaq going up because we're staying at home. IWM and SPY going up because we have a vaccine. Bears think they're still hunting velociraptor bulls, but the truth is they've been surrounded with nowhere to run.
Xpev market cap lower than nio
He cant sell till March 2021
PLTR i'm gonna coooom
She doesnt have a basement cuz she lives in an apartment building. Why are you lying?
Until the dip happens
ITS MEME TIME! GME GME!  PLTR!  XPEV!
I bought 50 in 2011 for $6 each.  I sold 30 at 18k the last time it popped and started to decline. Can't decide whether to dump and be done with the scam or hold them forever lol
As a Tesla call holder, I‚Äôm genuinely baffled at how Tesla can keep going up
FOMO for retards that didnt load up on the 2.5 days of red
Not RIDE because I bought in
My puts are down but the ridiculous OTM call hedges more than paid for it lmao fucking Macy's
I was gonna jump in but I couldn't find the calls button...
I‚Äôve looked at NIO every day since it was $26 and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs too expensive‚Äù and every day I wake up and regret not buying the day prior.
ur about 2 months late
There will be a short term down trend as people begin to realize vaxx won't force people to fly

Yea, they can be used as collateral for loans. But they are not lending right now, hence it‚Äôs essentially dead money
How much higher you think it‚Äôll go? 800MM market cap with almost 7 bil revenue (but negative EPS)

Ah that moment when an autist gets asked a question they can‚Äôt answer.
Ok I'll try to sell one of my kidneys. I should have two of them, right?
went in for a few hundred GME shares, gotta contribute to the squeeze
At least I put in the work to fix his mistake.
If you borrow shares you have to "return" them by buying them back eventually
Free money bby!
Just curious man, how the fuck did you know about NIO back then
The last 6 months have been the greatest market for mortgages in the history of our country.  RKT has had two different earnings calls with great results yet the stock hasn't moved.  

This will never moon or shoot up.  Sorry but the market has spoken pretty strongly about this one.
Buy when there's 2-page bear DD on the front of WSB

Sell when said bear goes bankrupt

I mean, any tsla bull play is good, I'm just afraid he'll do like most the retards here and hold until exp. But yea, at some point between now and then that play should be in the green.
Not just any boats. They're making gaming boats with GME, CORSAIR, NVIDIA. All the techs. So QQQ and hardware.
Already up 41% üòå holding till my portfolio is back to where it was
Half this sub says get your outs ready for EOD, and the other half says get your calls in. Wtf üòÇ
the only thing is I don't see GME being a gradual squeeze like OSTK so I feel like the squeeze will be more like VW because people still have no faith that GME will survive in the long run and will sell of within a week so to me that caps the potential of the squeeze, but the short float being as high as it is may give it a better chance at the insane numbers so truly no one knows what the potential is.
MSFT breaking out üöÄ
Alright I never have played SPACs, after the merger will the ticker symbol SBE still remain the same ? And SBE will then operate ChargePoint?

Did XPEV cure corona?  It's about to pass NIO up.
Sold just now  to secure profit, let's get one more dip so I can buy back in and then keep ripping
In case anyone forgot, NIO is still charging full steam ahead.

Holding long on an EV portfolio is the way forward
It really is
Don't have the time to read it all right now, but in essence I agree. I think we have another few good week before the lockdowns and increased covid cases wreck us. No one seems to be taking it seriously

I plan on liquidating a lot of my assets next week and going more conservative stocks and VXX calls
Bought some amd 90$ expiring tomorrow let‚Äôs pray
What an original thesis, brb selling all my stocks because some dude on the internet predicted a market crash.
*Another* EV startup? Geez. Seems like we see a new symbol pop up every day.
I feel like December/January is going to be a bloodbath as we hit new infection, hospitalization, and death highs (everyone breaking quarantine because yolo it's all going to be over soon anyway). Plus students coming home from college tracking disease everywhere. Add on to that this Christmas season being a trainwreck due to minimal in-person shopping and impulse overbuying, nobody having money, and massive eviction/default rates on the horizon. Oh yeah, we also have a possible government shutdown looming in early December, and who knows if the current administration will even care about keeping the doors open.
But how will I know what to buy puts on? üò•

They never learn. Spy calls are free money right now we will be trading above $360 next week
That price is ridiculous
AAL is in that range. 1000 won't be much in the world of CSPs though
My 590c 12/11 is printing
The banks can absolutely use reserves above the minimum reserve for lending purposes. They are called excess reserves. So if the FED adds to a bank‚Äôs reserves that will increase the excess reserves (unless the bank hasn‚Äôt met the minimum requirement which is unlikely). Right now they are just choosing not to lend because who would want to be exposed to commercial real estate right now lol.

The argument that the FED doesn‚Äôt print money because it pays in reserves is misleading.
does power hr pump more rofl?

guys luckily I figured it out, the market is stupid, I bought calls in the morning LOOOOOL JUST DO WHAT SHOULDNT WORK AND YOULL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION SPY 370 0DTE

Are you for real? Do you realize what's going on with EV stocks right now?

This isn't gain porn, it's sad. Because it's nothing compared to what other EV stocks are doing. 

Here's some gain porn for today: https://imgur.com/z0K1GKh

I think TSLA is up, what, 3%? The surge in EV stocks has been going on for days/weeks while TSLA has only had that S&P 500 bump going for it and only in the past couple of days.

With cultured meat about to get into our super markets and plant-based meat alternatives on the rise, shorting Tyson Food is free tendies.
well the good news is that you have even more time to make tendies, highly likely that it's $600+ by April.
Thanks, yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping will happen to them.
Undervalued how? Comparing then to Logitech, which is running at $80 ish with nearly 3 times the EPS and much higher market cap, I expect CRSR to stop at $40 ish. I mean I hope it goes to space, I have calls in CRSR. I just dont expect it to.
EV craze is hitting everything related. Huge gains across battery, EV and related stocks. Good time to get some profit! Just gotta keep a close eye on things if need to bail. Seems to be all related to Tesla surge. Thanks papa Elon!

All my calls are 30c and 35c in March, so not too worried about short term. Although I may hop in with a few earnings 40c lottos. Should have done it yesterday. Great long term potential into 2021 here.

You should watch this documentary (forgot what it was called). But essentially the whole idea of ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù will not accelerate the EV market in the US (it actually hinders it). There has to be government intervention, which ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù counties/continents like Europe and Asia provides. Look at Norway and it‚Äôs adoption rate of EV. There is no way US will catch up purely through ‚Äúconsumer demand‚Äù.

Truth. The bag isn't just heavy, it's getting dusty too. The very idea that companies need to be very profitable disgusts me.
??
So retail investors saw the rise of Tesla coming but not the smart money? the index funds and people who are going to buy Tesla shares due to S&P 500 inclusion had no clue about this and hence held no positions or calls??? Sounds strange that S&P 500 inclusion would prompt smart money to spend exorbitant sums to buy Tesla shares. Also, wouldn‚Äôt there be laws or regulations governing what happens when a company is included or dropped off the index...S&P 500 is revised every quarter to drop and include companies and that doesn‚Äôt seem to affect the share prices much due to finds buying into it due to inclusion or exclusion
flat as hell
I sleet long dated calls print as the company starts to generate huge income off their distribution.

Imagine if you bought calls.
it's camber angle
Nah it can. We‚Äôve seen what KBIO did, 10,000% off a similar situation squeeze. OSTK was 70% short and went from about 15 to 130, that was 70% short and was much more stable of a squeeze. If Cohen buys out GME and loaned out shares must be sent back, shorts will scramble to cover. They won‚Äôt even be able to cover on day 1 becuase a lot of the shares shorted are fake, synthetic shares. So their will be a fail to deliver and shorts will just be fucked. They‚Äôll have to wait and buy at high bids and just limit pain. I know it sounds insane, but you can‚Äôt gauge this situation, it‚Äôs never happened before, the only thing a little similar is KBIO, which went form 40 cents to 43 dollars. Ppl will be rapidly buying calls and mms will have to hedge as well buying shares, but they literally won‚Äôt be able to at some point, it will jus be a cluster fuck
NIO EOW?
Great. I will buy a few hundred hope not late to the party.

As a Tesla call holder, I‚Äôm genuinely baffled at how nio can keep going up
I think I bought some tsla puts a bit early, but I still feel my vibe about it going back below 500 in the next hour
I have some 31 DEC calls, that‚Äôs the literal definition of long term
save it for tomorrow
no, I said book value per share. Very rarely is a company valued at 1 X book value. That would be an extremely easy value play - those hardly exist.

Honestly man, best way to beat them is to not buckle in and pay the aftermarket price. Let them bag hold the 15 they bought. Stock will come into retail sooner or later. Hope you get one soon.

It‚Äôs rare but it‚Äôs going to happen to some people, really not a concern for vaccine efficacy. If you really want to stay in the loop on this news, read Derek Lowe‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn the Pipeline‚Äù blog.

You know that might not be half retarded, but I'd go with stocks instead of calls on it. NIU, NIO, XPEV and LI have been pretty much tied together, when one is doing good they all do good, and vice versa

I seriously feel bad for eBay. I remember back in 2000s when kids figured out how to sell their Diablo 2 items and eBay was like NOPE gotta be a physical item so throw in some card with that if you really want to sell your Amazon warrior princess'es used leather underwear. Just shows that no competitive advantage lasts forever, there is always some moron who fucks it up. Now I just gotta keep questioning myself - am I that moron?
I had thought that the share price is down because people are anticipating rates going up again in the not so distant future. Competition of course makes sense though
not yet
Remember everyone was saying amazon 4000 eoy? It's been flat for half a year

Well done DD ... completely agree. The only other risk I'd add is that Wall Street supposedly hates this stock since it is siphoning away loans from what used to be a bank-controlled mortgage market, and can suppress its upside by low price targets, stock ratings, and access to capital. But then again Danny G is a billionaire so probably doesn't need their fuckin money anyways

Lol yeah I sure would be happy with losing that much money.   Is that why you're about to sell your car to buy more puts?

I won't have a car payment until I get my CT, but that's just because I can earn more with the 70k over 3 years then I'd save by paying off a loan at 1.99% APR.

I'm sure these are unfamiliar concepts to you, like "fiscally solvent", "good credit" and "making money" but keep at it slugger.  One day you'll move to the register from the fry station.

Theta feasting on pltr
Covid cases are up astronomically from the first crash, unemployment is still just as bad, lots of states headed for lockdown for the next several months at best. Obviously we are headed for a crash, no one should need to look at a chart to see that. However, we've learned in this market that logic, charts, basically any type of research doesn't matter at all. So you're probably wrong
hate to burst your bubble but GME is not going to 300-400

if there is a massive squeeze it has a chance to go into the high 80's-low 100's
Have been wondering the same thing...

PLTR 10:1 stock split coming in 2024 when it hits 3k

Because I‚Äôm sour that I held my calls while they were at ATH lol just not looking to get crushed when they close under 505
lol yeah that‚Äôs a little much. I mean I pointed it out but didn‚Äôt mean it as a comparison to worth
while detailed DD (thank you), RSI itself isnt anything useful, oversold is possible because of dimming prospect on the business outlook. From TA perspective we need to include additional analysis (trend following, trend reversal, and momentum are the big three i know) for swing trading, for long term hold, as a mortgage company, economy doesnt look better off since covid first hit, in fact i feel like it‚Äôs going to be worse for a while, stock market has been decoupled with the economy is my take, so i would argue they are better off right now then they would be if the rates start going back up and mortgage applications start falling due to prolonged covid shutdown/ slow economy
Am I missing something with Zoom?  Why in the world would a glorified Skype application be worth as much as it is?
Lol I knew they were poised to have a good earnings. I put them in my list ready to buy, but then I got distracted by other positions.

[deleted]
That shit is going beyond the Oort cloud.
The problem I have with this "impending stock market crash" scenario is the following:

The Buffet model looks at total market cap/GDP. GDP has been adversely effected by COVID -related shutdowns. Once a vaccine is distributed and cases go down, GDP will rise quickly (quicker than a housing bubble crash for instance). People will get rehired at a faster rate once businesses start opening again and demand rises. Inn the meantime, stocks will continue to go up on good vaccine/Covid news. Cases are at records highs so there isn't really much more bad news COVID can give us. 

Yes, the market may be overvalued right now but (aside from vacation stocks) businesses will come back quickly once places reopen. As a result, GDP will come back quickly. Absolutely there will be dips, but we are not going to see a sell-off like the sell-off that occurred in March.

Jesus the amount of posts in here excitedly talking about Xpeng passing Nio's stock price as if it means anything when Nio still has almost double the market cap. The amount of people gambling on this shit that don't even know what a market cap is. We must be nearing a top of some sort
Last chance to buy CIIC before it moons after market another 25%
I'll load up on 100 contracts of GME $13s...but I don't see it going there. It'll probably drop to $12 again and bounce between $12-12.50 for the next month.
NIO is poorly managed, can say that - not sure about xpeng...

too much show not enough go in nio, you know? should be far ahead of where they are but again poorly run
60%
Apparently they have 4 wheelers tho
What does that mean?

GLUU is heavily underrated.
I see, I‚Äôve been writing the call and buying the call at the same price to hopefully make money off time decay many times over. Fucked me over today on viatris of course because I‚Äôm not anticipating gamma enough, but not every day can be a 7+ day at least

Premise 3 is trash 

he even says so in his own explaination of his stance

> the Feds power is..... effective. 

then goes on to just arbitrarily say that won't be true for long. it's objectively effective though, and he seemingly understands why.  

don't bet against America.
I think we rip in to close and possibly even tomorrow a bit. I'm thinking the Trump presser this afternoon is for the EUA for PFE's vaccine. We will run because the market has ripped on every peice of vaccine news so far. However, I think tomorrow we will end the day red and next week will be deep red.
this post is so good

4 million volume today though
Any chance for FCEL to gap up for this last hour and a half or no?

If those are for January, 3015, then yeah
Just never had the same hype since that massive dump it took from $15. My January calls have never recovered.

Any reason?

I went in big on PLTR @ 9.97 and SBE @ 15.60, AMA
Yeah I'm an idiot... Hey they're up like $15,000 already
i got dec 18 calls with strike price of 40$   
will def sell before then but nice to make some quick tendies
Bought in early October for the Ant group ipo but doubled down at 256. Good luck

Ok so the short squeeze won‚Äôt happen just off this move lmao. Earnings are in a few weeks. There is a good chance Ryan Cohen buys out GME after those earnings, IF he does do this, literally moonshot, I can‚Äôt even gauge what price we‚Äôd hit from this, 300-400 is my estimate, maybe more. After shareholders vote, short sold shares must get recalled. So shorts are fucked if that happens and it‚Äôs just limiting pain at that point
Just letting you know I have strong respect for your argument for more skin in the game.
It's ok PLTR baby take your time, I can wait, just keep going up
Hang out with retards, behave like a retard
NIO wake yo punk ass up!!!!
EV run started like a few weeks ago. Hardly at the point of bursting.

Oooohhhhh, you were too nice to be a magic man, they are pure evil, always saying that growing +10000000% is not posible for the invisible resistence or something like that
Glad you are the person I‚Äôm trading against. A lot of stupid comments. According to your premise 1 you would‚Äôve missed out of the run up of stocks in the last decade. Also, ever consider that the long-term low interest rate environment (with signaling that it will continue to be like this) fundamentally causes valuation multiples to re-rate? That‚Äôs the problem with historical analysis, the world is fundamentally different now. So why are multiples expanding? Because interest rates are low and investors need to reach for riskier and risked investments to maintain rates of return. Essentially chasing yield. Investors go for treasury to IG to HY to blue chip and beyond. By your logic, you would‚Äôve gotten out of the market in 2015 waiting for the dip, which didn‚Äôt come until the pandemic five years later and you still would‚Äôve been worse off lol. I‚Äôve seen so many people try to time markets and it‚Äôs hilarious to watch. Take another page out of Buffett/Graham‚Äôs handbook and think about mr market. Do you need to sell now? Think about it as owning a business instead of a stock and you make much better decisions. FYI, you think Buffett is out of the market now? Haha

While the ‚Äòmarket‚Äô has become over valued, look at why. The breadth of the recent run up from covid has been extremely narrow. Almost all of the run up has been in only a handful of stocks- FAANGM. Take a look at the market valuation excluding these stocks and you will see a great opportunity. As vaccine optimism works its way into the rest of the market, you will see a rotation to value and cyclical stocks and likely out of tech. What does that do to overall valuation of the market? Who is to say.It will probably keep it flattish, but bigger names will have less influence on the overall market as the capital will be dispersed to the rest of the market. 

Running on vaccine fumes is a joke, where do you think the market will be in March when the vaccine is in the process of rolling out?

When people say the fed is printing money it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs effectively true. They are increasing the money supply by purchasing newly issued treasuries from banks. It credits the banks, which is treated like cash even though it doesn‚Äôt print cash. The cash is considered bank reserves, but banks only are required to hold a specific amount of reserves so all extra is used to maximize profit through lending/purchasing of long duration assets. You highlighted increasing amounts in high quality securities. Go down to line 9 oh they are increasing loans and leases as well. Oh and that number is 2x the size of treasury and agency securities lmao. Premise 5: feds funds are entering the market that is why you are seeing the markets stabilize (that downward tick). Banks don‚Äôt just hold the reserves in hand. They lose out on yield. Even if they are buying bonds, lending, etc. that money enters the economy. Sure they may be holding more reserves than before, but that is natural in a pandemic! Premise 7: the market is forward looking and most of the unemployment is viewed as temporary. As the pandemic drags on, more and more losses will become permanent, but they will be nowhere near as high as ‚Äò08. Probably shake out somewhere around 6%. 

Again, glad you are the person on the other side of the table. FYI, I work professionally in the markets.

Let me guess you did not read the entire post to the bottom where it said to buy the ITM LEAPS?

If you did the then theta will not be much of a factor for IV and theta becomes less of a factor as well (I bought a big chunk of Jan 2023 $10s)

Now I can sit back and not give a fuck for 6 months, although I think this thing could rocket to 60-80 in 3-4 months and I would sell have to lock in gains.

Must of the tards here will only buy FDs a week to maybe a month out and sell during a down spike or wait it out until they become worthless.

Discloser I did buy some of the $25s and $30s just for the fuck of it knowing full well they are retarded as fuck.
Sold the SOLO, glhf

First all of what you said is speculation. GM CEO spoke today and said nothing about NKLA and they are not going to do anything until NKLA lawsuits are done which could be a long time. GM is the safer play but knowing this site NKLA will be pumped and bag holders will be newly minted.
Buy best buy.

1. PFE announces conveniently right after the election (no I'm not a Trumptard).     
2. MRNA (with fucking shady management) anounces within days and with better efficacy.     
3. PFE corrects its numbers right after.     
4. There has never been a vaccine based on mRNA ever, and all of this happens at about the same time.

Might be a good time for puts now
Is this going to be another dick beating weekend?
Have you considered selling half or something?  If every trade is all or nothing, you'll end up with nothing real fast.
Free bag!

VTRS 20c 12/11
It‚Äôs gotta rip at some point right?
im a bull but i want a pullback so we can rally again this shit is gay
PLTR is a company
Post your mom's next play fucker so we can all make tendies
Imho, seems like GM is going to let the time lapse till dec 3 and pull out of the deal
-to lose money
I sold them as the short leg on my diagonal spreads (trying to slowly cash in my 46 and 47 dec/04 calls)
Then buy puts and post

There hasn't been a rated AO game in over 5 years. Ebay could very well include rated M games in that section if they wanted to its up to their own interpretation which they haven't been clear in their guidelines.
Ouch I chose 590c 12/21 am I retarded enough? This helmet makes my scalp itchy.
You're wrong about my politics. 

It's unsurprising that you would perceive an attack on your evident R partisanship as left wing bullshit though. That's the definition of partisanship, seeing things as a tribal battle.

I wish you all the bad things coming your way.
UPDATE: I made a quick $300 and sold my puts within 15 minutes. I'll take that as a win üòÅ

PLTR? Positions or gtfo
baba you dirty slut.  I thought you were gonna bounce up and go back to at least 280.

I got calls because I believe in you
It‚Äôs not really a momentum stock. It‚Äôs a long term hold. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend fd‚Äôs on this one
Got it. All in SPY calls
So what your saying is there‚Äôs more Gains to be made
So buy Coty calls or what. We need the information man
Is CNBC saying anything about GM and NKLA? I'm on a call and only see that they're making a big EV investment (which was already known)
Sell 20C
Disappointing
aapl ready for its daily swan dive
Yeah I bought it yesterday hahaha
China‚Äôs EV market went I think doubled this year if I‚Äôm not mistaken. And we all know about NIO, who knows they could rake it in if they secure some deals with these big EV players. It‚Äôs risky for sure but I feel it could be good.

u like calls?  it has a massive amount of calls today on it
NKLA and GM have potential work together and GM will have a stake in NKLA shareholders, invest in NKLA or GM?
Arrival is a seriously well thought out company and product. I watched a video a while back about them and it‚Äôs seriously impressive, especially for the UK market which is where they are based. ‚ÄúFully charged‚Äù is a YouTube channel based around EVs which is where I saw Arrival initially and I‚Äôd seriously recommend checking them out. They had Xpeng and NIO covered for a while. Wish I‚Äôd jumped on both much earlier
Also, the reason behind the question I posted is because the people that hold the same opinion as you tend to think only 1 dimensionally - "free college is good" while ignoring the vast number of issues involving the implementation and social/economic implications of such an idea.
Bull trap
sounds like you didn't hold your options in Nio? I'm pissed i sold. I would have made money.
Soros has a nice surprise for any PLTR holders at 20$
At the end of a day it‚Äôs a penny stock that can jump or drop 40% at anytime. Basically the same as playing roulette and going black or red.

How in the world do you manage to sell PLTR at a loss? It‚Äôs like 30 cents from all time highs.

Thinking a big gap up eod till Monday
I've noticed this sub is just filled with wanna be wallstreet people who laugh at your investments because "Lol chinese" or whatever while throwing all their mad money acronyms around. 

Meanwhile I've gone up 30% just today. 

The morpheus gif posted about NIO 2 days ago was accurate af. 

You wan't 10% yearly? Go ahead, Im going balls deep on that red pill.
Am watching that too :)
robinhood is actually better than TOS lmao
üëç
What do you think it will go up to? Agreed tho, its not being spoken about much.
CRM to 300 in coming weeks for earnings run up
Did you just wake up from a coma
I have 125 spy calls that expire tomorrow strike 165. Why?. Cause fuvk it.
He said could.  He's not wrong.  It technically "could" go to zero.  You're the dumb dick reading stupid click bait. Ain't none of them fucks know dick.
Buying but $2.5 calls available for me
üçª to those that downvoted SOLO doing a 30% day this AM.
Place your bets. Who's going to 50 first. Nio / DKNG?
baba don‚Äôt tease
COTY on his alt.

What was the DD? For GME?
They have... read the Q3 ER. But I know too many words.
Summary - stonks go up.
TSLA has been fighting 500 all day.

Just let it happen.
Just woke up to BABA's first potential green day after 8 straight Red days... Congrats call/share holders. Although im out of BABA since 290
PINS week chart looks fucking insane.
It‚Äôs prob too late with this run but I jumped on the train anyway. There goes my last 1000!
I appreciated the insight but shorted SPY yesterday
Shit my man you aren't kidding. Let's just get it back up there and get rich!
lmao up bigly on it and its only gonna go up more. why u buying shitty weeklies
$RIDE is kil just do some TA
CRSR 11/27 40c printing baby
Got a whiteboard up on the wall. Still down 22% yoy until I break even. Should hit that within the next week or so. Up close to 300% in the last 30days.
SPY puts too obvious. Which means I inverse. But then I have to inverse myself because I'm retarded. Now I'm back at SPY puts. What do
Naw, I think I actually saw her post here a couple times, p sure it's the same one.
Yeah Spy is so undervalued it should be at at least 550 and the S&P should drop all stocks and only invest into EV companies.
FUV is just a meme right guys?  I mean their car looks like a tricycle.  No one's gonna want that.
Get your shit together Tesla
You must have scrolled through like what 20 comments? People have been talking about blink for hours
send my condolence
NIU looking like a solid run up before earnings next week. Still a sleeper at this point. Hoping to break that $40 mark and run from there.
I catch that and was like are they talking about ‚Äònkla‚Äô?! Seems like they want to avoid a loaded question/topic

Bad time for me to have a $13 call sell on the table. It was $0.05 today and now $0.25 ffs

I'm short tern, but when it comes to determining how long I'll hold, I take it day by day
WHAT DID HE POST
rug pull imminent
Yeah I was surprised at how low it was as well--also considering it's a Japanese country and the dollar is probably going to fall so that'll get it up even higher.

Who just bought 52c NIO weeklies from me?

Thank you
Because it is Thursday. Check the charts. For the last 6 weeks or so GME has mooned on Thursday and crashed on Friday when everyone either exercises their options or they expire worthless.
$23.5 next week.
at this point I‚Äôm all in on BABA, HYLN, FB and puts on some shit called EFA
you're the moron that bought the options based on random posts
My calls would be worth about $5.5k ($4.4k profit) + IV. I'd be cool with that.
Yea that was dumb, I got in at 13 originally then bought more at 15
Is SOLO actually with investing in long term. Those things look pretty stupid to me. Who the fuck would ride one?? Will the develop real cars in the future?
I mean they‚Äôre expiring tomorrow sometimes you gotta cut losses
thoughts on JD? dropped hard after earnings, could be a good dip to buy
The stock is up 19% since Monday. Maybe you should start looking at the mirror.
Why is this bullshit pinned gay mods
Honestly these ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù are no more accurate than your typical WSB shit poster.
I've got 20x 2023 $35C. Can't wait to buy my lambo at 23 years old

[deleted]
thinking a big dump eod?
Or a man who isn't a degenerate gambler.  Again its the Macy's of video games.  At least shit like Tesla and NIO have a chance to change the world.
It turns out that if you change the weekly part of all these options into long then you can actually make a lot of money off of these idiots

Im starting a rumor about BABA‚Äôs new EV
Got a couple calls today for 40c 12/18. Let see how tomorrow plays out. But won‚Äôt lie don‚Äôt know much about the company just see that it keeps ripping.
Tis bullshit
Is mango speaking at 4 or just pence? If it‚Äôs just pence there won‚Äôt be a ridiculous vaccine pump.
Puts on ebay. Thanks !!!
She'll need the money soon. Bitch is shorting TSLA.
Still hanging out at the bottom of that channel. I would sell half if possible just to protect some profit and avoid holding too many expiring options overnight
Xpeng is the new Nio.
Oh damn, I'm in danger of not getting assigned shares on my GME $13 sold puts tomorrow.

It‚Äôs just weekly so expiring tomorrow. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going back down at all before end of day tomorrow
What's wrong with a bright future?
SOLO is amazing today
So, let me get this straight. /u/namsilat posts the greatest DD of all time and mods ban him for it. So dude makes his own sub, and mods now ban anyone who mentions him? I'm not saying, but I'm just saying.

 I'll probably get banned for this comment but the dude did it again two weeks ago, and again yesterday.  This place really shot itself in the foot.
WSB as a life style
Where do you work where you can fall asleep lol
It is Thursday. Thursday has been when GME has mooned for a month or more now. Then on Friday everyone sells their options and it drops again.

Yeah that's what I'm most worried about, I'm glad I saw your comment cause I almost sold at 95-97 range it was stuck at and then it popped to 504 so thanks for that. When they announced the stock split I sold for 500 profit and the next day it would've been 5500 so I think I have some ptsd from that

Even a dead hooker is more useful and pleasurable than falling Baba shares
GrowGeneration (GRWG) $40c Jan 15 2021 & 35c, same date.

MP Materials (MP) $17.5c Jan 15 2021 & $22.5c March 19 2021.

Cinemark (CNK) $22.5c June 18 2021

I will be buying shares of MP and GRWG too, not just options. Options only for Cinemark tho, I'm not interested in putting capital towards them for longer than the date of the call, I can use the money elsewhere in places that will move faster. Cinemark will go back up tho in the next few months once the vaccine is released.
Robinhood is so much more user friendly than tos. I know i am learning a new app on tos, but everything just seems to flow much easier on rh and easier to navigate, streamlined to be easy for rtards. Maybe there is customizeable settings i am missing on tos but, still
it was during my lunch hour so im good
Where did her jawline go
AYRO up 37%
The difference is in extrinsic value. The 2 options are priced differently because the greeks are not the same, particularly delta and vega.

buy more.. we're going up and fast.. soon
What tends to happen on expiration weeks like today? A lot of options gonna expire tommorow
Id cum and then retire. I think it may go in for some sort of retest so get your diamond hands ready if so.
My man :(

I said Calls on CRSR bro not PLTR :(
Right, kick ass. Well, don't want to sound like a dick or nothin', but, ah... it says on your chart that you're fucked up.  You talk like a f@g, and your shit's all retarded. 

Don't worry, scrote. There are plenty of tards out there living really kick-ass lives. My first wife was tarded. She's a pilot now.

Just bought $2000 worth of qqqj calls. Not sure how this will go
Even for Sept. and Oct. it went down a total of $20 versus February where it dropped to 200.00. If you draw a line between the charts you will see that there is also a point after that where it rebounded almost too much in September and actually evenly distributes to it's current price.
check FIS, both FIS and FISV are closely related.

&#x200B;

mainly FISV is benefitting from google pay parternship with exxon. plus the fact it has a $110-120 pT forever and only broke through until after baccine news/post-earnings overselling.
Hmm. This sub has only handed me losses when I listen to people but at the same time it provides  tons of tickers with potential

NKLA was the implied "final question" from the moderator about "one specific" partnership commercial opportunities for their Ultium battery and fuel cells.

And Mary Barra said she had no update or comment. And went on to say how they were focusing on their own lines.

I would bet money that GM had agreed upon rules that the moderator could not mention NKLA by name.
It‚Äôll dump. Right, RIGHT??

There is a dump coming EOD just wait
See what I shoulda done was buy GME like 5 minutes ago
Nothing just GM putting down more cash for EV stuff.
They've already scanned this comment and you are now on their database for future mind-manipulation. A benefit of owning their stock is they don't target you with their algorithms.

Well if you take November's daily OHLC and a linear extrapolation from that:

Open: 18.78

High: 19.86

Low: 17.88

Close: 18.9

That's pretty much like reading tea leaves so I wouldn't trust it much. I don't think it will cross 19 until a gap up over the weekend.

What is mgni and why did my coworker just go all in lol
Youre a fucking moron ya moron. You don't know shit. You will be able to buy and sell in a cash account only 3 times in a 12 month period before you are flagged. I have been doing this a lot longer than you dipshit so read this and you just might learn something.

Good faith violation

What is it?¬†A good faith violation occurs when you buy a security and sell it before paying for the initial purchase in full with settled funds. Only cash or the sales proceeds of fully paid for securities qualify as "settled funds."

Liquidating a position before it was ever paid for with settled funds is considered a "good faith violation" because no good faith effort was made to deposit additional cash into the account prior to settlement date. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur good faith violations:

Good faith violation example, Marty:

Cash available to trade = $0.00

On Monday morning, Marty sells XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds

On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000

If Marty sells ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.

Good faith violation example, Trudy:

Cash available to trade = $10,000, all of which is settled

On Monday morning, Trudy buys $10,000 of XYZ stock

On Monday mid-day, she sells XYZ stock for $10,500

At this point, Trudy has not incurred a good faith violation because she had sufficient settled funds to pay for the purchase of XYZ stock at the time of the purchase. However:

Near market close on Monday, Trudy buys $10,500 of ABC stock

On Tuesday afternoon, she sells ABC stock and incurs a good faith violation

This trade is a violation because Trudy sold ABC before Monday's sale of XYZ stock settled and those proceeds became available to pay for the purchase of ABC stock

Consequences:¬†If you incur 3 good faith violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.
GME spicy!

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1789760/000119312520297313/d40716dex991.htm
If they go with the multi tranche approach, then the first date is Dec.14th, and the memo sent out says they are discussing whether it would be 25% then 75% on the 18th or 50/50. So as early as the 14th is when they could start buying shares. However, the analysis I came across said the other funds tracking the spy can start buying right away. All this buying pressure is the reason it will keep going up and people/funds are trying to get in early as they know they'll have to pay a higher price the longer they stay on the sidelines. I think 600 is a good target price by inclusion date.

I mean you answered your own question..
They are ITM now.
I've been re-analysing my position like crazy the last few days. Thought I'd really caught the falling knife on this one.

It looked undervalued with holidays basically here and potentially good news over the next 2-3 months for the Ant IPO. 

Plus, China forecasted to be half the demand for luxury goods by 2025, and the trend increasing for most of that purchasing happening online.... seems like this can only go up.

Why 60 days? Why can‚Äôt you sell and buy in?
Hmmm
Lmao this market is fucking bullshit
Where else are people gonna put their money, bonds or savings at like 0.25%? lol
Bidu looks like it tends to fill gaps within the very next day or three days. That means it might play in the 139-142 range tomorrow.
GM taking off
PLTR green dildos
1-2 months til expiration. 10-15% out of the money. Buy when the stock dips and ideally have the strike below the main resistance levels so you don't get cucked and expire OTM. And try to sell to close with 2-3 weeks left, leave some meat on the bone. Trend is your friend. Use MACD on the 1 month chart to see how momentum looks. Good luck.

What‚Äôs the news on GM?
Yes. It is almost at $9. Actually Insane. Wondering whether to sell a portion now or just hold.
Buying puts
I sell if I get to 30% loss
let‚Äôs break though this resistance and never look back
Giggity!
Dude, I closed my shit out at close yesterday. I didn‚Äôt have the balls to hold through. Something told me I‚Äôd regret it when it mooned into the high 40‚Äôs but somehow I made the right call. Took what little profit I made and I‚Äôm happy with it. I think if the election shenanigans didn‚Äôt fuck with it leading up to earnings we would‚Äôve been smiling big right now.

They have several funds. It is not clear from what one this is.

The Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha for example has ‚Äúlonger holder periods and smaller stocks‚Äù than medallion fund.

I agree with most points you said. One question regarding banks: they do create money though via fractional reserves added by the central bank or not? That they don‚Äôt lend it out is another (valid) point. In general I also see the economy is a dangerous position.

GAWD I hate to buy Tesla. I don't know why. It's one of those stocks you buy just because it's going up.    Guess I'm in.
> Here is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.

QE does not remove liquidity. The banks hold loans, reserves, and treasury bills from in their assets. the banks sell their loans to the Fed, the Fed gives them reserves in exchange. the bank t-sheet nets out the same. The reserves from the Fed are equivalent assets to the loans that the bank made. 

On the fed's t-sheet, there is an increase on both sides. they increase the reserves(assets) and they also increase their t-bills(deposits)- this is where the printer comes in, JPow just adds more with his spreadsheet.

Banks don't lend out reserves, they don't lend out deposits. Loans -create- deposits. Coming at the t-chart from the Fed side, the Fed creates treasury bills(assets) and reserves(liabilities), uses those reserves to buy the bank's loans. So every time JPow goes to the printer, he's expanding the monetary base.

But I mostly agree with your gay bear logic on the rest of the parts. There's no liquidity if banks don't lend money, or if consumers don't want to borrow/can't borrow.
Means I am in the right place here

I‚Äôd look to see if they had a pump on those days over the past couple years I‚Äôm not sure EBay actually makes any announcement on numbers. 

Short term the calls might be fine It‚Äôll take at least a quarter after this takes effect to see the impact to earnings. 

Also possible eBay gets it head out it‚Äôs Ass and figures out a solution or delays the payment system.

>Is this also true if you have loans, such as student loans, that are income-based on repayment through the federal government? Meaning if I'm only paying $600 on 250k per month, I should save that cash and not try to pay them off if they will be forgiven with 20 years of payment.

I am not a financial actuary.  Probably pay your loans however it is scheduled, I don't have a clue about what a lot of what you're asking about.

I do know every 30 years, at current inflation, money is worth 50% less, make that work for you however you can.

In bullish on GME and bagholding it but afaik rentech only trades using mathematical models and algorithms. They literally don't hire you if you have a background in economics/finance because they know those people don't actually make money (compared to indexes) on average and almost all if not all their traders/quants/swe have PhDs in unrelated STEMs
You said you believe that Tesla's [fair market value](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=tsla#:~:text=Tesla%20Inc%20(NASDAQ%3ATSLA) is $20 a share, giving a them a 16 billion dollar market cap.  There's no other word to describe that other than retarded.

Most obvious bull flag in history for GME. Two in one day.
You can miss big gains, particularly if you are writing calls on a growth stock. For example, I very stupidly wrote some calls on xpev and li earlier this month. I‚Äôm getting assigned for a profit relative to initial purchase price, but way behind where I‚Äôd be if I had just held the shares.
You aren‚Äôt amazed that someone just dropped $100 on a comment that took you 60 seconds to type out.

I for one am bullish on ‚ÄúEV company‚Äù so I‚Äôve added it to my tracker.
I feel like the next red day will wipe out 60% of this sub

üôèüèºüôèüèº
Yes. But it‚Äôs less risky than holding just the stock/option. Because the stock can go down a bit before you start to take a loss since you received a premium for selling the option when you enter the position. The upside risk is that your potential gain is given a hard cap, whereas your potential loss is reduced by the premium received. Use when you think the stock will stay the same or go up slightly, it‚Äôs still a bullish strategy.
How fucked are my aapl 1/15 125 calls?
I can only speak from history. But RKT is a solid company. It just doesn‚Äôt budge...but it will. I was making 100 day on the Apple swings. I honestly just see what is hot here....and then exit when it‚Äôs on blast here.  But one thing I do agree with. RKT 5000 today.  Could be 15k in a year if you can just park it and don‚Äôt touch it. Easier said than done. I got lucky on the climb. But also got wrecked. I think CRSR is worthy too.

It seems kinda new and volatile, it‚Äôs done some weird shit lately. Holding is risky, maybe cash out and wait for the next dip?
Calls on your mom
Yes, actually, I did my homework. That's the brand that has all the Kendall & Kylie stuff, and Clairol (old lady products). In-store products. Still well below the pre-covid peak of 11 and change. Figured that'd blow up before holidays. Then all these states started announcing shutdowns so I bailed.

Only had 100 contracts ($800) and didn't lose money, but if I'd held for a few days it'd be worth $6500. Sorry son, no PS5 this year.

Anyone holding FUV?!?!

Tell me GME is gonna actually plummet after ER so I feel better about my 2021 puts.
I think +21% in a day is a little crazy. When it drops to $15 again I'll buy more.

Yeah, it is amazing actually.  I miss squats/deadlifts, but it's so awesome to have in the apartment, very motivating and no commute time to gym.  The fact that it includes yoga/strength/guided running/etc. is a super plus as well.  Bought it at the start of pandemic, and soon after grabbed the stock.

Okay CRWD, TDOC, SHOP you can all keep going up now
If the stock goes down enough, sure.
If the underlying goes above your strike you technically are ‚Äúlosing‚Äù money. But you set your strike to determine the amount of profit you make by collecting premium and if you are assigned

honestly i don't really think it's going anywhere soon, maybe mid 2021 but eoy it's likely staying ~$3 and not worth risking options.
Should I use Tesla to cut my losses or will it go back above 505

500c, still have good gains for the price I got in at but they were almost triple earlier before that first drop

Thanks. I will check them out. 
One Chinese market sector I have got my eye on is chipmaking. Due to international pressure from the US, the Chinese chip industry does not have access to the EUV lithography machines, nor high tech chip makers to take on TSMC. The government is putting a lot of money into developing home grown tech, even buying Chinese chips for their government PCs etc. Could be quite a few interesting opportunities if these firms make it to the US in the form of ADRs.
thats a lot of buy volume, might make the push to 520

There is massive inflation in investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, pokemon cards, cr1pto) 

The only reason inflation is slower on their bullshit CPI indexes is because most of this new money doesn't actually go into the circulating economy (decreasing velocity of money versus total money supply). 

Capital injections will only EVER have a temporary affect on CPI indexes because as that money flows through the consumer -> business -> owner -> tax/wage -> consumer cycle any excess money will be siphoned off into assets. Only way to increase inflation in CPI goods long term is to increase wages or decrease taxes on the middle/lower classes

Is this liftoff for real? Or are we about to get cucked by theta gang?
Tesla is offering covered replacements for any effected units, thereby negating any need for a recall.  You could even bring in your car prior to the MCU failing and they would replace the affected ECC chip.  Not withstanding that most people who *could* be effected by this have or will upgrade to MCU2 which does not have this issue (only cars from 2012-late 2017).

Although I can see how this would effect you as a non investor and non owner....
Today flat asf but it‚Äôs gonna end with a dump
Well bud. Theta is about to kick in for me. I‚Äôm taking my $40 that‚Äôs left and buying beer. Been fun.

I bought 3/19 800c's on the 3rd (Nov) for $7.34 because (cue laugh track)  the Schwab trade assessor said they represented the biggest move on a 20% move in TSLA. Sold today for $22.80 because it had grown to too big a % of my portfolio, and there was more return now in rolling up to 900's or 1000. It's a little weird buying at strike prices that I know are impossible, but I  did the same with GM 3/19 55C that I'm still holding, and they're up by a larger % than any of the strike prices below. Seems like the outsized premiums for a lot of these call options makes the real outliers on strike price move more aggressively

No. It adds them to its ‚Äòbalance sheet‚Äô. Which is why the graph looks like this:

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst\_recenttrends.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm)

See the spike after GFC? Then slow increase to circa 4T. Then the sharp spike this year, now sitting just over 7T.  


 ‚Äòwhich cannot be used for anything else other than collateral‚Äò 

Collateral by whom: the Fed or the sellers of the bonds?

All the yes!  QE is not really inflationary or deflationary.  The fact that the banks are not lending is deflationary.  What that means is the fed is pushing on a string.
It seems like the only way to fix the problem is with multiple large economic support packages to create demand.   Without the economic support packages, we‚Äôre headed for another depression.  
Great writing I completely concur.  The fact that the market is going up should be a matter of serious investigation.   Whatever is going on there seems exceedingly dubious to me.

You can‚Äôt value that shit retard. This is a market based around potential, not actual value cause boomers are dying.

Another big wave after that when the people they infect at thanksgiving become symptomatic.
All the Chinese EVs have room to grow as the hype spreads to the normcore. They are all close to profitability too (more or less, NIU is actually already turning a profit).

You‚Äôll do better when you‚Äôre not so emotional about your stock picks.
200 dollars away from running my account from 2500 to 25K with huge loss for me (14k) on the climb (7500 gain on NKLA puts being biggest win)- in about 4 months. Also currently PDT restricted til hopefully tomorrow.

current method that is around 75% successful (and the one I'll stick to) is... yes--buying stocks(on margin) - then using those gains to play options/ memes and yolos. It is very hard to process the FOMO and sit tight while watching breakouts.  Recent Yolo obviously being NIO (which I don't believe will hit 50 til next week) ($4200 gain- 3K greed penalty.)- have exited all positions- too stressful.

Point of post? My own documentation and I Just wanted to throw it out to the miasma of people who get it and just understand sometimes you just need to air it out. It helps to be heard. I'm to scared at moment to make a bigger account because when numbers turn into cars and mortgages I get weird- and I have been wiped clean before (30k loss in a month) 

Anyway.

You might be right in the short term. Markets have run up pretty quick for dumb reasons. But otherwise you're probably mostly wrong. Correlation does not mean causation. Also I find it hard to read your post when it's littered with bias. I appreciate the effort but a shorter more concise post with just more facts and less opinion would be nice. 

The markets recovered quicker than the economy because the major indexes are cap weighted. It's caused a skew. If you look at the russell 2000, you'll see it took a lot longer than the s&p or nasdaq

Yes, but I think you might be forgetting to add that most likely the US government is going to force Tesla to recall over 150k Tesla's affected. The fact that Tesla knew that the infotainment would fail leaving the customer without critical safety features is bad enough. The fact that customers are complaining about it taking over 12 seconds for their backup cameras to appear on the screen and that Tesla service centers are determining that those MCUs are okay and not covered is absurd and scummy!

You have to remember that over a long period of time, things go up. Period. This is because of the nature of life. People LIVE, they work, they earn money, they spend money, they consume, etc. All of this equates to a net increase in *everything*. While there will always be periods of down, the net is always up and if you miss out on those crazy ass makes no sense up days because you‚Äôre scared, you‚Äôre gonna lose out big. 

In my opinion the best thing is to pick good strong companies with a bright future and go for it. Don‚Äôt ever have money in the market that you‚Äôll need to touch in the next 5 years. Feel free to hedge your bets as you see fit by using puts or by taking profits but in general, always have your money in the market so you don‚Äôt miss out on the big gain days.

Thanks a whole fucking bunch explaining this simply. I have always felt like I was cheating a system in some way by not being able to afford the actual stock but paying the premium to reserve the right to buy at that price then selling it to some person who can afford it. Then I felt like it's strange to allow people to purchase stock cheaper than it is because the people who can afford to purchase the stock reserved at a lower price could just afford the true price. Making it more stable to a degree. Because there is no speculative price or whatever. But I get it now like this. Still seems like a cheat code if played right. Since people can go from 1,000-1,000,000 without ever actually buying stock

That is correct.  Of course anything could happen at any time with GME, I'm deep in calls/shares because I don't want to miss the train if it starts early.  The dec earnings could definitely start the major run, but its possible we may not kick off until the Q4 ER in march.

Cohen sent a letter to the board monday.  The articles are a little confusing and more bearish, but the letter itself reads as "fix these things or else," and includes the phrase "I won't be happy with a single board seat (which they have offered him)."  He amended his 13D with it as well, which indicates he may be using it as a cover to avoid a lawsuit if he forces a board vote that kicks off a short squeeze.

He also requested a full public review of the strategic plan, which would likely happen by Dec ER.  They are in the quiet period, so they may not do anything before that...but a strat plan would include talking about what they are doing now, and they would be trying to make it look good so he doesn't take actions against them - so we'd hear about all the good things happening with the console release.

TLDR, good things happening during the ER in dec probably.  Strong chance Cohen pushes for a major stake and control of the board, or makes a buyout offer.  He referred to current management as dinosaurs, so it isn't a stretch to think he would want the CEO spot - especially when you look at what he has said in past interviews.  Oh and he hired one of the best law firms in the country for activist investors/M&A/tender offers

If they can't print money, why do they have a printing machine, hide the actual amount in circulation, and remain decoupled from any commodity standard?

It has to be your broker then, though not sure what the 20/30 portion of your call is.

This is what I see quoted

Jan 15 2021 $20 calls for SPCE are 5.20/5.25; SPCE trading at $23.90

Jan 21 2020 $20 calls 10/10.70
thinking about selling to open some deep ITM SPY calls...good idea or nah?
if you're happy with your gains you should sell
One thing you fail to realize is that FED intervention in the Agency MBS market is more important than their Treasury activities. When they buy MBS the cash doesn't go into reserves; it is injected directly into the investment sphere. 

The FED also has a number of SPVs injecting cash into the economy

Here is the way to think about subprime in relation to 2008 -

Soo much appreciation was happening in a short period of time that you would buy your house with 0% down and the appreciation would cover your mortgage and you refi out and the appreciation was your down payment. It‚Äôs all good and dandy. 

But this is making a long term investment require short term appreciation. And when that stopped you had to either liquidate or have cash.  Well people didn‚Äôt have cash soo tons of homes were repoed and liquidated. 

The value of real estate is kind of based on a lack of liquidity. As Homes go on the market homes are worth less and people freaked out and then everyone was fucked unless you had cash. 

In theory if you have the cash to own, you should buy as much real estate as possible with debt. Not full cash purchases too obtain this increase across multiple properties with the ability to bail yourself out with cash.

There's still the [TINA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tina-there-no-alternative.asp) problem which you haven't really addressed. Everyone is still sitting on boatloads of cash, looking for somewhere to get a return. With interest rates at 0, there's nothing else to do but put it in the market. You can't just sit on cash because you lose it to inflation. Stocks aren't actually very overvalued once you look at their valuations relative to bond returns.

This is why every dip gets bought up within days, sometimes within hours, and why there won't be another crash unless we start to see runaway inflation and the Fed is forced to raise rates.

For most people their homes are their main equity. That was the difference. This economic situation is a reallocation (the money from fixed income, commodities, etc. had to find somewhere to rest) but this is not equivalent to an actual collapse (that is, an asset class falling apart from the bottom up like real estate did) and so for instance if the largest banks go to zero on all the mortgages in the United States and abroad that is a huge problem.

>No person with any financial sense would actually do that, you're far better off not doing that and investing and paying your mortgage like normal and keeping the leverage because of how inflation works. You want to have debts to pay off with future, fundamentally less worth, money.

Is this also true if you have loans, such as student loans, that are income-based on repayment through the federal government? Meaning if I'm only paying $600 on 250k per month, I should save that cash and not try to pay them off if they will be forgiven with 20 years of payment.

1. For a battery to have the range of a gas tank it would have to be bigger than the car. Ergo, all current EVs are shorter range and the batteries are bulky and expensive.

2. For a given amount of horse power an electric engine is much heavier and more expensive.

3. Much of this cost is due to the exotic and volatile metals used.

4. A lot of homes don't have covered garages. This rules out many potential buyers. Also, exploding batteries is a thing.

5. All this is not as green as you think. First because many coal and gas power plants built almost a century ago still work. Also, mining exotic metals is fundamentally dirty even ignoring greenhouse gas stuff, and a lot of the countries mining don't care about going green just for getting greenbacks.

6. Gas engines have gotten more efficient over time. For instance, they're using thinner oils now to reduce internal friction.

The bottom line is EV will not overtake gas until some fundamentally new way of storing/using energy is found. Maybe later this decade something in quantum physics will open up, but the gap between theoretical science and industrial application is about 20 years.
All the dips are being bought
They unironically were through Blackrock
The capitalization of a company means shit in the short term if the government forcibly shuts down their business. Many Chilli and Shake Shake restaurants are located within shopping malls, if the malls are forcibly closed by the state governments so will the restaurants inside them. I fully expect the entire restaurant industry to tank over the next 3 to 4 months, until vaccine availability allows states to rescind draconian measures.  At that time, you will see a massive rebound on companies which have the characteristics you describe. Going long on restaurant stocks right now, when they are at all time highs but on the verge of disaster is absolutely retarded.

That's not what his reply suggests at all. The point is the fact that some lawyers are investigating in itself doesn't mean anything either way
With more covid restrictions kicking in combined with Christmas PTON seems like it‚Äôs due for a run
As a heads up from a guy who has been trading for over 20 years and timed the feb crash correcty.

The stock market always has 5 very likely things ready to crash it. Always. Seriously every single year of the last 20 years their have been at least 5 very plausible things ready to cause a 10-20% drop.  And it has happened a few times. Generally most of the things don't cause the big impact they predict.

That said at 50 years old, and the high volatility; my retirement is mostly out of the market, just not an older mans game right now. We got nothing else to invest in with safe returns; so a little stability from Biden and good news can get a bunch of $$$ back in the market. Sell now you miss that.

Nope. Got puts thinking it would tank soon with record cases, it just keeps rising. I don't see it stopping any time soon.
You mean Antifa riots? Or are you really that dumb?

Gotta admit Mr. Fake Steve-o-Meter has me shaking in my boots a little bit. I really don't wanna go full cash gang though and I hate to watch puts expire worthless, so maybe I'll just do nothing and be scared for a while.

Are my BABA 270c's bought on the lunchtime dip going to be ITM EOD?
are we though
Thats fair, let‚Äôs hope it doesnt happen right away, otherwise people will get fucked in the ass
I guarantee you many TSLA traders are kicking themselves watching the other EV stocks kill it while their stock only stopped sinking because it was being added to the S&P 500. Just wait and see how many now will be taking profits & rolling them into other EV companies that have room to run instead of a company that will have to grow into its current valuation for the next 10 years
Don't count on a sustained dip in this company.

Palantir is only being called a "meme stock", because retards are making memes about it. That makes the memers idiots, not Palantir.

They are actually an extremely solid company, with a very very good leadership team.

Literally their only risk is Joe Biden and the Dems, and in my view, I think Biden will continue doing business with them.

Maybe I will sell my position in Intel and buy another 200 share but I don't have more money.

Are you from USA?

Bag hold until it pops? It doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting the no news jumps of Ayro or solo .

My theory is that people are Leary of Fisker after the last failure. I would take leaps on it if you were playing options (I can‚Äôt yet). I‚Äôm personally bought up on its stock for the long term expecting more jumps early / mid next year as them and Magna hit delivery milestones.

4.5 billion - 5 billion market cap is not impossible for CRSR.  That would give it a price target of 46-54 dollars.  I don't know if it'll be by the end of the year, but its not impossible.

Of course, the timing though, idk. Buy stocks or leaps.
MNKKQ It's a company about to go under.  I'm just super  curious what if anything would happen if they threw 100k at it.

I‚Äôm holding calls overnight
1:27 pm 11/19/2021- I'm adding a few positions as I type this, a couple already closed. They are:

GrowGeneration (GRWG) $40c Jan 15 2021 & 35c, same date.

MP Materials (MP) $17.5c Jan 15 2021 & $22.5c March 19 2021.

Cinemark (CNK) $22.5c June 18 2021

I will be buying shares of MP and GRWG too, not just options. Options only for Cinemark tho, I'm not interested in putting capital towards them for longer than the date of the call, I can use the money elsewhere in places that will move faster. Cinemark will go back up tho in the next few months once the vaccine is released.
Yes market please rise on all the great news about lockdowns and Covid. Thanks. Appreciate it!!

I didn‚Äôt hear what the GM CEO said, I assume it‚Äôs good news for NKLA put holders?

They mitigate risk for the seller.

Let's say I have a side hustle making umbrellas.  They bodega owner who buys them thinks the season is going to be rainy, so he wants to order 200 umbrellas.  He's scared that the season may be dry though, so I offer to sell him an option contract.

I say he can reserve 200 umbrellas for a 10% fee.  If the season is dry, he only loses that 10% instead of the huge amount he would have lost being unable to sell the umbrellas.

I, as the umbrella maker, still get 10% instead of nothing in the event of a dry season.

Furthermore, if the season were rainy my umbrellas would be in high demand, driving up the price. By paying 10% to reserve the umbrellas at a locked-in price, he simultaneously reduced the risks of a dry season and a rainy season through the option contract while increasing the profit margin in the event of a rainy season.

I thought that at first too. But covid didn't affect the healthcare sector, public workers, etcetc.  Mostly the service/hospitality industry, small business and low minimum wage earners. All of the people i know who shop at Costco are still working and arguably doing better. No commute, spending less etcetc
They are just making it seem so bad with the economy shutting back down while everyone in the market is bullish
It‚Äôs going to get buried but I appreciate this information. I‚Äôll save this post and read it over again it‚Äôs that great.

Actually what I'm doing too, I wasnt very specific about it in my last comment. I pay for professional stock analysis and buy leap calls on undervalued companies when I see volume spikes. Once I'm tempted to sell, I sell a near expiry otm call instead, with my leap as collateral. Once my leap is near 60 dte or when the stock hits its fair value I look for an exit. I just started doing this strategy this week so I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. I wouldnt want all of wsb at this IQ level, what would be the fun in that?!

>	To be sure, the best available evidence from countries that have reopened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risks to school-aged children ‚Äì at least in areas with low community transmission. That said, the body of evidence is growing that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-7) and, contrary to early reports (11, 12), might play a role in transmission (7, 13, 14).

Even the cdc changed its guidelines.  The same cdc that said kids can go back to school.  But you‚Äôre prob an antimasker who just wants stonks to go up so what do you care

There are significant trades today in this particular strike. The worst you're looking at is probably $3.20 -> $1.60 if you sell at 10 AM tomorrow. The upside could be 5x. Not a bad trade if you're a degenerate.

Lol, if you check out BA and ZM, the stock is closely inversely related. I have positions in both of these, so I get double fucked or make some tendies. Today I am getting rekt, rip
 I'm so balls deep in ev I cant find my real balls anymore
How are you tards buying the premiums on these calls? It's outrageous. You'll need it to moon to make any tendies with huge risk
Those tires are off center.
wtf this is gonna give me nightmares seriously
You fucking called it bro!!! I LOVE YOU
I mean sure. Basically, you can sell your stocks now and wait for the dip or ride out the dip. No one on this sub, myself included, has enough patience for that. 

CRSR is probably going to get shorted at some point. I want to try and time a sell before it does and load up again. I probably won't be able to do that, so the next strategy is change my password to Etrade and forget it for a few months.

This won‚Äôt be the case by 2024, and it‚Äôs still cost effective for industrial business that can‚Äôt stop to charge. 
Seems like a lot of people are confused about this. Batteries are great when you are going to one destination, then going home. But what if you need equipment to run 24 hours a day? 

This means: 

For equipment (This is why amazon and Walmart use hydrogen for their green warehouses):

(Cost of electricity/HR x Uptime) + (Net loss of down time/HR x charge time) > (Cost of green hydrogen/HR) 

This equation is how a business determines whether hydrogen is better for their commercial activities. This will be the case for ALL hydraulic equipment where the cost of downtime costs and electricity costs more the green hydrogen. This is why PLUGs entire plan revolves around producing more green H2.

The fed buys bonds off our government who can issue however many bonds they want, and that's how we get "BRRR".  That's what funded our trillions in stimulus.  Since you don't think the fed is printing any money (btw hello steven van metre), how do you explain the M2 money supply dramatically increasing this year?

Everything you said here is right.  But the market doesn't give a fuck.  It was just flooded with money and valuations, fundamentals, and the state of poor people are irrelevant now.  The world goes to shit next year and the market keeps pumping imo.

Reality is there‚Äôs going to be euphoria over vaccines, new president, stimulus, but I expect that euphoria to last longer than what OPs timeline is. December? We‚Äôll still be in COVID era idealizing the earnings in a post Covid world. 

If the bubble bursts ‚Äî if ‚Äî it will be once we finally start seeing signs of normal life with the vaccine and then the market decides that it‚Äôs all been priced in when post Covid era earnings can‚Äôt meet the expectations priced during Covid.
if i double my account within this year, Ill put 50k down on a gallardo and finance the rest.

Premise 4 is deeply flawed. QE does not remove liquid assets from the market. If those assets were actually liquid then the Fed wouldn‚Äôt have to buy them. They‚Äôre buying them because no one else wants to, thus making illiquid assets into liquid assets.

It's sell time. It's incrementing up while most other EV stocks are soaring in double digit gains for multiple days. And the only reason it's inching up right now is that it was added to the S&P. People are going to start selling very quickly if NKLA holders start posting gain porn.

The date on an option contract is when it expires. Any time before that date, you can either 

exercise the contract (call: buy the stock, put: sell the stock) 

or sell the contract.

What are your metrics for "performance"? A Tesla Model 3 performance edition does 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds for $55k (and that's before the economic savings of "filling up" off your home's electricity rather than at a gas station). That's pretty high performing for the pricepoint.

Well, you see, the SP is now already under what you bought it for. Not saying it won't go back up soon, but I'd really be careful if I were you. This thing might go up a bit more in the next few days but it will eventually go back down like all other SPACs until the merger is confirmed and is going to happen soon (few weeks max.). GL

PLTR IV still really high. When‚Äôs a good time for calls?  Next dip?
>Just these two funds will need more than $12B of TSLA shares to get their AUM to reflect the new S&P accurately.

You need to adjust for the fact that if the buying pressure pushes the price up, then the shares already being held increase in value, somewhat reducing the need for shares they would otherwise have to achieve proper weighting.
If you made money, don't feel bad.

5 minutes after I sold 14 TSLA 520c 12/04/20 they were worth 5k more. Im still fuckin happy

I was heavily contemplating buying options this past Monday...I really regret not doing and selling my KNDI calls for a measly $88 profit which would have been $3k+ today.
Made 2k in 9 minutes today buying 5x 500C and selling once it hit 560.50.  Just a quick momentum trade cause I had some capital just sitting there.  It's holding around $500 very strong, once it breaks 510 it's gonna gap up and find a new support level above 500.
People like you were saying the FED would be buying ETFs in June.
People talking shit about NIO and their December $80 calls are up bigly

11/20 18c and 12/4 17c where the rocket at?
That was the dip to buy. It was postponed for reasons out of their control.
Nope, no idea how the stock price will move in the near term. Long term the stock is bound for the moon tho. Their outstanding  revenue growth, profit margins, and opportunities to be a major player in AI hardware makes them my number 1 long-term position.
Who else bought high and sold low today?

Thanks for doubling down on your ignorance and lack of reading comprehension.  I didn't type "electric vehicle" - I specifically typed "EV".  Using nouns like "cars" as modifers to acronyms like "EV" is something taught in places called schools.  Schools are places available to the kids that don't get expelled for incessantly licking the windows, so I can understand your confusion.

Oh, okay sorry, I honestly thought they were somehow involved with that. But main point remains, they do more than just EV
I did a monumental fuck up yesterday. Closed a GoodRx credit spread and tried to roll down but there were no open interest on lower strikes so I‚Äôm like I‚Äôll just roll with Walgreens since Amazon news is moving them in sync and Walgreens is bigger, more liquid...... 

WBA still going down and GoodRx up 11% today. I am a clown ü§°ü§°ü§°
You're absolutely right, maybe i'm looking at it in short term and you are looking at it in long term. I absolutely hope that, under Biden, the US will commit to full green energy but i'm not convinced atm... its a slow process and in short term the dilution is detremental for shareholders.. but you do have a point, their options are somewhat limited atm.

"NINJA" loans weren't open and uncollateralized. At no point in recent banking (50+ years) could you just walk into a bank and tell them to give you money. You had to have some kind of collateral. The strength of that collateral is what was misunderstood (much like stonks always go up, land always apprezziates) but not the idea itself.
CIIC cliff diving
we're just going to keep going in circles here

My opinion is that if you're expecting something this big in the market and still playing it safe, you're not confident in your own analysis

I think the anti trust could benefit alibaba since exclusivity deals benefit their competitors more. Think about twitch and how mixer and fb gaming tried to gain market share by signing exclusive deals with streamers.

Bought 400 shares with an avg $22.80. Sold  OTM CC for a month or or so. finally sold OTM CC at $21 before earnings and it crept up over $21 and I let it expire. Broke even overall.  Bought some other stocks that have actually moved up, couldn't be happier finally free of the sideways walk. I think everyone was disappointed that RKT did not offer a dividend. You can't keep piling up cash and not give it out to the investors.
i believe tsla ATH is around 530

It's all speculation obviously but because of the SEC and DOJ subpoenas people think whatever is uncovered could be enough to make GM sever ties. I'm not a fan of the company either but personally I'm bullish only because it's been months since the fiasco and GM hasn't already cut ties and the December 3rd deadline for the deal is fast approaching. That being said I wouldn't be surprised if it all fell apart either

Why is PSTH always pinned to a price? Was $23.20 for a week, then $23.90 for days and days, then $24.90, now pinned to $23.90 again.
Its retracement dude. Very rarely will a high volume stock rise sharply and keep rising. It's how people momentum trade and then short at the high. Buying back in at the retracement levels. If I had bigger balls I could have made an extra 16k today doing this... 

But my balls are empty from all the shagging I've been doing...

TSLA bull flag?
Stay humble kings. Little bit gains, little bit profit. If you don't know what you would do with a hundred bagger tomorrow, then you have time to spare.
Conclusion: Virtually the same excuses provided just a different year. had this post title been  "...we are headed up folks."  it would have got a few thumbs up.  That's right son.

This is exactly why the market keeps going up.  IF everyone was long like in 2000.... we'd be in a bubble.  Amazon was a bubble stock at $200... and if everything is a bubble.. is it really a bubble or that fact that all boats are rising.

The economy is not the stock market.  The FED may not be able to openly PRINT money... but money supply - yes the amount of money in circulation HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER....  never!! and its a coordinated effort around the globe.

Money has neve been cheaper.  Mortgage rates at an all time low.  Central Banks hell bent on keeping their feet on the gas pedal.  The government ready to dole out more money to everyone.  You could surely craft a bearish perspective.  No doubt.

However we got the worst economic disaster of our lifetimes.  And the stock market rallied to to new record highs.

Exclamation point.  end of sentence.
Still limping
We all know they'll just be another vaccine announcement on Sunday night and this thing will open at 364 Monday morning

So in summary, you are saying we need to buy SPY calls. Thanks
One of the dumbest things I see on WSBs is bearish posts telling us how dumb retail investors are the only ones being bullish/buying stocks. If you think the totality of retail investors are exclusively or are the majority reason driving stock growth you're a fucking moron. Hedge funds and banks are constantly shifting around tens of billions worth of instruments every day. When (eg) Tesla booms like it did this week it's because hedges are buying collosal fuck tons of stock and calls, probably to cover short positions. Big money makes huge plays all the time and that's what drives markets.
Would I be crazy to buy $CRSR calls today or wait for a dip?

Yup completely agree, people think they have a lot of cash, but it‚Äôs expensive to keep growing, especially as musk have a lot of vision and plan to keep going, hence the priced in growth expectations. Also lot more competitions are popping up now, which might force him to grow even faster to take the market cap over quickly. I think i‚Äôm done with TSLA For now, there‚Äôs a lot of other companies that have potential jumps lining up other than TSLA. Or if they raise more capital i might buy back in after that, it‚Äôs a solid long term hold i still believe, just quite risky for short term.

Literally. If someone has 20+ years of trading and still isn't a multimillionaire (5+ million, not that barely over 1mil poor people shit), then you can easily swerve on whatever advice they're trying to peddle.
What trades?
almost 4 months ago, July 30: AMZN reports earnings. Scalped AH shares at $3175, sold 5 min later at $3255. Someone replied to me in here: Why not just buy and hold? AMZN will keep going up! ü§£ü§£ü§£
should i get in TSLA 550 Dec 4th call or a 600 Dec 24th call?

They‚Äôve done other things outside of dilution. Green bonds will become more prevalent as they continue to reach and exceed their price targets. 

We also have to note that the US is fully committed to moving to fully green energy, and Biden especially majorly supports the hydrogen infrastructure being developed. 

If we want commercial industry to be fully green, hydrogen has to be an option. Charging the batteries on machines required for large scale supply chain operation is just strait up not an option. Aerospace also has to move into green energy too, and green hydrogen once again is the only available strategy that can instantly fuel jets like they do today. 
You can‚Äôt leave a revenue generating 25 million dollar asset on the ground for five hours to charge up, it‚Äôs not financially viable at all.  

I would expect large government subsidies, and additional financing options gaining traction as they continue to execute, which they are.

Holy fuck the Mango administration is so desperate and pathetic. Fuck these guys, I am not even American but I hope they get fucked with their conspiracies and the trash they talk about.

See this is where we just differ on our opinions, because if your entire post preaches that the sky is falling and the market is more inflated than it's ever been, your positions, IN MY OPINION, would be a little more aggressive than puts one month out at a -$5 strike point. 

If you think you're right in OPs case, you don't have to bet your mortgage the market blows up, but it's like saying a tsunami is about to hit and your preparation is to go get your floaties.

I'm not arguing against his logic, I'm saying his positions don't indicate his sentiment. 

OP literally says "market crash" and when pushed to talk about timing, he says "2 months tops" but his positions don't line up with that logic. 

His DD looks really good, I'm not arguing against that. I'm saying that his positions don't make sense. He's saying a tsunami is about to hit while getting his floaties out.

Damn would have been up well over 2000% if my orders went through a few days ago. Had orders for 20c and 22.50c for .20 and .10. Now they are like 5.80 and 2.75.
Pretty sure most states have a bylaw that states all teslas must have vanity plates.

>I am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go

That was a very long winded way of coming out of the closet and I'm sure your dad still hates you and thinks you're a disappointment because you wore a dress to prom "for kicks".  No one is surprised that you're gay, however we*are* a little surprised that you aren't still sucking dick behind Wendy's.  That was a solid job, and you had to throw it away, it had the damn fringe benefit of providing you with filling meals 16 times a day as well.  Your mom and I doubt we'll ever see you reach those same heights again.

Now here you are trying to convince everyone that you're into stocks, but we all remember the kid that gave other kids a Klondike bar each to stick a piece of rebar up your ass.  At least the human society took your dog away finally, I couldn't stand the thought of what you were doing to that poor thing.

We don't want you home, but we also don't want to have to read nonsense like this again, your mother and I feel it's probably for the best if you just go live at a farm upstate.  You'll have plenty of room to run and you'll probably meet other degenerates like yourself there.
Sure, my money for your reddit username.

As a principle, it's a sound principle. Obviously now is risky to enter. Harvest your gains and leave some on the sidelines. OP did a great job with his analysis. These posts are rare on here and it has some good indicators on where we could be heading. As for crashing big time, that remains to be seen. If jobs get better over the next few months we could avoid a major crash and see more of a market correction. The problem with these sort of analyses, however logical they are, the market has been all but logical over the past year or more.

Me:  Hey mrDoctor, I need to use emergency anti-retriviral because I wanna engage in unprotected sex and don‚Äôt want to use a condom. 

Doctor: No 

Me: but please I might get HIV! 

Doctor : how about you just use a condom? 

Me: but it‚Äôs been approved!! 

Doctor: it‚Äôs for healthcare workers who are accidentally exposed to HIV/hep , or rape victims. 

Me: but but but... [Anonymous unprotected sex] is a right! 


Now replace anonymous unprotected sexual with a travel business of your choice.



And you know what. I bet if there were enough regards who knew that HIV anti retrivirals are a thing if administered soon after, there‚Äôd be quite a bit of abuse.

No, I would buy puts just like OP said. Maybe read the fucking post more closely. $350 SPY puts give you cushion to see how the market reacts AFTER the dump. Maybe it‚Äôll dump further, maybe it‚Äôll bounce back rapidly. Either way, you‚Äôre ITM.

agshwjwjwkq you guys fucking amaze me sometimes with your logic

If you think the market is going to implode and do so within 2 months, and you have confidence in your own fucking DD, would YOUR play to buy $350 SPY calls?

If so you're either fucking retarded or don't fully believe your own DD. OP didn't say it was going to be small. He said it was going to crash and soon, so saying 'if it's a big or small drop' doesn't apply, because OP specifically stated 29 million times in that post that he expected a big drop.

It's just about if it can hold above 500. If so, then potential blastoff. If not, consolidate back to 400-440 range that it's been stuck in. If it ends in 440-500 range also bullish as it would be rejected by 500 but finishes above the previous consolidation block. 

I personally sold at 500 today, will be looking to re-enter once it consolidates again.

People are doing take out orders WAY more than they have previously done before the pandemic. These big chain restaurants have adjusted themselves to the pandemic and have brought forth online ordering taking themselves into "ghost kitchen" territory. Food ordering apps have facilitated this phenomenon and this will continue until things get "back to normal" and more people go out to eat at restaurants.

**There is pent up money in the middle and upper class doing absolutely nothing.**

Assuming a non depreciating , non income generating with equalized appreciation property class.

You‚Äôll rarely find underwriters whole have that spread unless 
1) small / private lender v big bank
2) credit / income of the two borrowers deviate that much
3) the lender / bank hates money and either the prime-.25 is too low or the prime+.15 is too high.

Going into IPO's on the cusp of a potential market correction is a dumbass idea. Sure, you might get super lucky, but probably not.
Roll up and out.
throw some in my tuition?
Although they are...you figure it's offsetting fixed costs.   Some of the raw materials they buy may also be purchased for other things..... bigger orders...bulk discounts....  maybe some new equipment that will be used post covid vax thats getting some accelerated depreciation.....    all that good pr from saying non profit.   

I feel like even though they're zeroing their profits against vax sale....its of financial fuckery and is beneficial.  How significant.  Not sure.

Stop buying up SPY every time it drops you idiots. You will never financially recover from this
can you not post the ticker?
One more comment on this - it introduces problems if you are planning a long term hold on a stock. If the stock goes up substantially you either let your shares get called away or you buy back the options at a loss. Now if the stock faces a downturn you've lost money on the calls you sold plus the shares you're holding, it's a double whammy.

So you should really only do it if you're ok selling your shares off at a target price.
Macy's gap down tomorrow...

Hey, I actually did sell for a loss which I‚Äôm fine with - the relatively large buy order was a mistake in the first place. 

In total, it was a [$33K realized loss](https://i.imgur.com/oYjaezP.jpg) which I can use as tax loss harvesting to reduce capital gains taxes on other investments. 

It has also allowed me to diversify & keep much more in cash to DCA overtime. With the recent market rally, I‚Äôve ‚Äòmade back‚Äô almost $20K. 

I‚Äôm still long on TSLA, but have a much smaller position, about $50K worth. It‚Äôs great to know it‚Äôll be added to the S&P. I don‚Äôt concern myself over the what-ifs, just glad to be making profit.
*We're looking forward*

Buy now at ATH so I can get to 100% on my units
yes shorting WBA is guaranteed money. you can probably short them all the way to zero if you hold long enough.
LMAO...my dude..that was fuckin funny. But devils advocate again...his stock is still going up. Everyone knows it was a shell of metal rolling down a hill. Still going up. The truck looked cool. If they have the actual build plans, that saves GM some time as they have the production capabilities. All I‚Äôm saying is, this may not work as everyone is expecting.

First real bullish sign. Should pull back a little, as long as it stays above like 255, it's pretty solid.
SBE is up. That's good right? I only own shares.
Lol what? You need to stop edging and bust that nut. It‚Äôs making you crazy
PLTR is just sitting at 18.5 soaking up every single sell order. This honestly feels really bullish. Its fueling for the next leg up.

18p and 20p for either a month or two out. I plan on closing them if they hit 30-50% of value and then rinse repeat.

100
so close. was almost up 420.69 on one of my accounts
Depends on the stock

Take TSLA for example. A few weeks ago, selling 420-450 covered calls was easy money

Now take the current rally. Sure, you would have made a few grand on your covered call + whatever appreciation you had from holding the stock.

But let's say you sold the 420 call. You make a few grand, the shares get pulled away from you when TSLA rallies to 500. You missed out on 80$ per share, so $8000 gain.
I was hoping for a return to the top by Feb. but if it clears 300 by end of year I‚Äôll close out and capture all that premium

I'd be green if I didn't paper fingers baba 260s

Sure, just depends on how bullish you are. The contracts are 20p dated a month out, and 18p 3 months out. I can also close the contracts anytime once I'm up, which they are already up today. 

I am probably more intimately familiar with government work and the military than most. Hence why I am so bullish. 

It's a gamble I'm willing to take with contracts already being executed and awarded.

the fed buying cooperate bonds is actually straight up illegal and against the federal reserve act. The fed can only buy etf's, and they skirted this rule by making their own "etfs" with the bonds they wanted to buy which essentially is like seeing a do not enter sign, stepping two meters to the right and walking through. 

  
Fucking bullshit that none of this will ever get enforced because politicians love the FED for doing it, but it also means that the FED will most likely end up buying straight equities during the next crash. In for a penny, in for a pound right?

Fuck guess it‚Äôs finally time to buy weeklies
most, overwhelmingly most
Yeah ?
Lmaoooooooo I LOVE JOSH BROWN
We run sideways today. Is the move to buy calls at EOD because we moon tomorrow when pfizer submits to the FDA?
just saw that gay bear post lol, gonna go all in on vix puts
Does it not go to the teddies supply?
Sorry to get all investing on you guys, but does anyone sell covered calls? I'm not seeing what the downside risk is. Missing out on potential gains when your shares are called away? But then you have cash and can just do it again... What am I missing?
AMD please
how we feeling about metals fam
Get in some cock push-ups.
Yeah, this... we used to post screenshots so we knew it wasn't some lame ass $500 bet from a broke college kid.

Screenshot or ban OP.
No never
What if Jack Ma lied about his sexuality this whole time? Would that be a potential catalyst for BABA?
Probably won‚Äôt break out until early next year. I think it‚Äôs consolidating right now.
School being closed means now kids will have more time to trade meme stocks on RH. Trade accordingly
So what you're saying is we should buy??
Up down up down.. this is boring
my story for today as well
Fkin idiot
Calls. Kept averaging down. Still down.
Thanks you fuck now my calls wont print
All hime tighs
i still don't know what PLTR actually does lol
i used to be like you...
There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing
Aye.
Well, I've left the ship to go get some coffee while they fix it.

Depositing more money just to buy calls
You know what that means right? Time to quit your job.
I agree with you there. I was in cruise but dumped after the vaccine news at a gain. I think they will go up once the vaccine is out but not to 2019 levels.
üåΩüåΩüåΩ

Triple top?
Honestly it looks like it's gonna explode upwards IMO. I've been watching it all day too.
Selling, or holding?
I bought some calls yesterday and today. 11/27 YOLO
Buys 2Bn in cars. Doesn‚Äôt sell them.
My portfolio is 100% options that's why I'm on this sub
Fine. I bought some PLTR calls. F this meme stock. Sorry I messed it up for you.
I just got in this morning. Hopefully Jack Ma bends to the will of The CCP
What's that about sub prime? Are you saying sub prime 25 is better than prime 15 because the appreciation is beating interest in both cases?

Bought that dip at like 1030 but turns out it was that fancy seven layer dip
this shit is boring man

i miss the NIO runup days
I'm in, don't think this is done yet
You misunderstand. I thought the inference was we let EV companies get away with stuff with things others wouldn't. He clarified afterwards
Lol the thing is it‚Äôs a great time to buy pltr. People are just panicking because of 11/20 calls
Update us you autist
Hahah!!!!!! You moron
I‚Äôd like to exit my puts. Can we fuggin dump one more time

China with 1.4 B population alone. Where they dont need lifted trucks and cars that go 140MPH. The solo cars make sense for their country. I hold no positions in it though.
the Fed does not buy bonds using "cash" because it cannot print cash. It buys them using bank reserves, which cannot be used for anything else other than collateral.
That‚Äôs the problem.. but this is fake

Yupp. 10% drop incoming. This coming from someone who rode it up from $14. Ride up ride down.
I agree tesla long term has amazing long term potential. 

Although you're ignoring what's happening today, and the temperature of the market for the next two months. Biden's tax plan coming, people locking in earnings. S&P Index fund won't be buying shares until Dec 21st, and if the price stays high, Telsa will issue more shares diluting the value. Model 3 was just discontinued for production profit loss.
The market inversed me today
u/shittytranslatorbot
Next to nothing. Lots of talk, very little action. The truth is, every so many months, someone claiming not to be a bear comes on WSB looking for validation of their theories.

Yes, the market is propped up. The economy and stock market havent been this far divorced since I've been alive. That said, this has been true for YEARS. Trying to time the market is fucking stupid and one of the most guaranteed ways to hand your money over to the pros. 

Unless you're retiring in the next few years, which I'm guessing it's a nearly zero percent of this sub, who the fuck cares. Invest yesterday and keep investing.
Sounds like a time paradox to me.

Will it go more up
CRSR dip jump in now
I'm *that guy* now. No idea what to trade. Not gonna FOMO into PLTR and TSLA. Doesn't look like the indices are going anywhere but theta. I guess I'll sell some puts.
My hands are covered in blood from trying to catch that knife but now I‚Äôm freshly bandaged and can take the kids down to cape canaveral to watch that sharp little fucker soar.

My move was to lose a lot of money a coupe days ago when it was announced and wiped my gains.

I left pltr and snap for all in on gme. Missing out on huge gains. Hope this fills in the missing.
I agree and am also long in recovery stocks. I disagree with cruise stocks reaching 2019 levels though. They dumped too much stock to reach those levels again without serious demand or buybacks. Idk but I doubt they will be doing buybacks anytime soon with the massive debt they have taken out. Some recovery, but not back 100%.
100%
UK public sector revenues looking rosy too; big defense budget injection and NHS likely to extend contract.

why, bc the tsla dip?
why tho
It has its days. I'm getting better. Went from -98% ytd to -48% ytd just this month. Ive figured some things out, education isnt free. First year trading options, started buying calls in febuary, should've bought puts instead, I'd be rich. Then I tried to catch the falling knife in early March. Then bought shares and sat on the sidelines all summer. Now I'm just following the money, trading mostly leap debit spreads, occasional fd scratch offs, leaving 50% cash value as much as possible, it's working out well so far which means this probably the top lol. Now a days if I'm making money on something and then I start to see it all over wsb everyday that's my que to exit.

pton has 2.5 million monthly subs and it is for that reason the king. Their workout trainers are literally celebs at this point. i'm just saying, that competition is paying attention and mimicking their business model. thats all. i actually tried their cheap 2021 Tread at the store. we're all for pton as our bike/treadmill.

About as un-American as PDT, yet both are legal.  I don't see the problem.

Watching BABA lift off is like watching a god damned turkey try to fly.
The catalyst is every analyst scouring the markets for undervalued EV plays right now.  If the reverse merger happens next month as planned this one will moon, if not sooner on the rumor.  Canoo vehicles are cool as shit I‚Äôve already seen them in LA and their disruptive first-of-it‚Äôs-kind subscription business model could make them extremely valuable.

Welcome my brother. Tsla bang gang jumping into pltr
100% of my portfolio is in Chinese stocks.... is that unamerican?
As in up?
So you're saying if he 'changes his mind' again and holds or buys up more, then it IS manipulation?

I look at what makes sense in terms of financial motives, and the only one that makes sense to me is to keep the price down while he buys more.

This wasn't some offhand remark, it was a deliberately issued announcement, so WTF would he do that knowing that it would have a negative impact on the price of a stock in which he holds a very large position. Just out of spite?

I mean, he still has an obligation to the investors in his fund to maximize their returns.

Just doesn't make any sense.
Shiny and chrome!
For real. As soon as I break even I'm fucking out
Just bought feb CRSR 50c's cuz why not
Can we not post about it so it doesn‚Äôt get ruined

Works until you have to buy the shares for a 30% premium when it crashes
but why 1-2 est?
I believe many big traders are buying calls/shares now because they anticipate the same thing we do. The volume since the announcement has been insane and can't just be retail traders.

give up tesla bears, you're wrong about this company. How much of elon's cock do you have to take to admit this?
Honestly you‚Äôd be surprised how financially dumb some people with high incomes are. 

Fact is people incredibly skilled and specialized in one field just has a short understanding in many others. It‚Äôs normal since it‚Äôs tough to be jack of all trades or immerse yourself with multiple facets of knowledge when you‚Äôve spent 12-16h a day for 8years buried in anatomy and physiology books. 

I‚Äôm a real estate investor and had to explain to several physicians why it was important to get maximum leverage in real estate when the value is heavily weighted on appreciation. 

And also why sub prime interest for 25 years is a fucking fantastic deal with respect to long term growth. 

But nope. Cash buy plz no debtü§™

Thats PLTR's model too
On premise 3:

It's technically correct that money from the fed printer does not go directly into the market (yet). But think clearly for a second.

 If you're a bank administrator in a market crash and the fed gives you a bunch of free money to sell as loans, what are you going to do with the extra room in your budget? 

The QE reserves give banks breathing room to use their other capital to play in the market.
Solid.  I'm just scared of the next big pump if the FDA rushes the EA on the vaccines and it comes in next couple weeks

Hey man,

This is just how we talk. It's our culture. I appreciate your post. It was excellent and well-thought out. But all we do here is call each other names. Honestly I wouldn't be saying your post is excellent and well thought out but you seem genuinely offended. I'd just be calling you a lame-ass otherwise.
TSLA bulls, definitely don‚Äôt sell. Hold on because that‚Äôs the smart thing to do. You will not regret it and that‚Äôs a WSB guarantee
I threw 10% of my portfolio into BABA calls this past week
It‚Äôs very undervalued and one of the hottest stocks in the past month, with lots of positive catalysts coming up. But ok
Is TSM worth buying today?????
I don‚Äôt know shit but when I see breakout to ath on every company across the board including those that have negative growth and is losing money hand over fist. I get the fuck out and look for shorting opportunity.

>t keep in mind he is the CEO of SpaceX as well - from what I recall, there are some big institutions invested in it. And plus he's likely planning on taking Starlink public at some point, so it's in his interest to make sure WallSt isn't getting fucked due to TSLA getting included in the S&P.

I mean I don't think he gives a fuck. They shit on him and tesla for 10+ years why would he look to do them a favor now? He even was taking cheep shots at them and the SEC awhile back.

In all seriousness you should throw some Tesla and pltr in there. Rn they are overpriced but they have the highest amount of growth in them. AAPL and amazon are running out of ways to expand their customer base is more or less everyone at this point.

You're not getting the point. 

OP LITERALLY contradicts himself. "2 months tops" is an exact quote by him, so if you're confident enough to say that, there's 0 reason for him not to buy puts 3 months out. 

His positions don't indicate his sentiment, not even close. If you can't see that, then go ahead and follow suit with him and buy your pussy ass SPY puts and volatility calls with him and wait for a dip. 

OP is using rationality in an irrational market, and even then he's not even following his own teachings verbatim.

I don't know the term AM, what do you mean, I'm curious and can't think of something that fits
Tesla DOES have massive growth potential, but at its current price, all growth for the next 3 years is absolutely priced in, 5 years probably, 10 years still probably priced in, hell it's probably just way overpriced in general...

Book value per share is something like $20 ? Share price is almost $500.

And... TSLA is only 40% institutional holders. Most are retail investors who don't even know what DD stands for.   


The current TSLA price doesn't make sense, but you can't predict if or when it will drop, so... I wouldn't buy puts on it. I'd just stay away.

TLSA 500 marks the end of the EV bubble. There will be some residual buying into year end (especially next week, and the week post thanksgiving) but it's over. Time to consolidate.  


Also, TSLA $500 probably won't mark the top for TSLA. TSLA $500,000,000,000 market capitalization will.
Fyi, stonks only go up.

This
PLTR I actually did DD, I'm genuinely long on them but I sold for my investment back and am letting 1/2022's ride for a few months. 

AMD seemed under-valued compared to it's Sept high and the general hype around it's products. Did some minor-DD and see their chips and chip-manufacturer are doing great. 

SPY lucky as fuck, threw a lotto out and got lucky on gut feelings. 

CHWY no DD, but it's my Covid play and I feel like they're just going to continue to expand anyway. They have shittons of warehouses, pay $15/hour already, and everyone has already discovered them during Covid. $80 by Jan easy.
Can y‚Äôall go into mara and riot so I can make $$. Ty in advance
Dude's 90 years old, PLTR might be his last big play. And isn't it stock manipulation eother way? I mean, he's under no legal obligation to follow through with his claim, and I see absolutely no reason to disclose that you're going to sell off while you're still holding.

When was the last time you heard a large scale investor outright tell the world when they were going to buy into or sell out of a large position?

Never, that's when.
I mean better save than sorry
This doesn‚Äôt look sideways to me üòè

The irony is that OP is almost certainly not the Steven Van Metre you looked up!

>500 will easily print
I mean yeah, its pretty smart to slowly get into bearish options as it goes on.  No reason to go full in if you're smart, even if you think a crash will happen doesn't mean you have to go full retard (like you) and buy expensive puts that may get fucked.

Only true retards actually think they know exactly what will happen (like you think everyone should act).  OP is being smart and accepting that he can be wrong, this way he won't lose much or at all hopefully.
I like your info, your logical reaoning, and understanding.

Market have never crashed with interest rates soo low.
Another stimulus package or two will greatly help the markets in short run, but not necessarily the rest of the economy.
How much of a pull back are we talking here? 10-20%?
And
A pullback would encourage another immediate and big stimulus.

I have a feeling NVDA is about to go on a faceripper to like 620 over the next couple weeks. After earnings market seems like MMs trying to cuck retail out of a dip buying opportunity

Bought on the low of the day it was announced Tesla would be added to the s&p, so around 440 - 450. Tesla swings so fast lol
TSLA open 530
That will largely have the same effect, since MMs or whomever wrote the contracts will need to produce and sell shares when the funds exercise. This means that they will be the ones forced to perform the buying, but the buying will still take place. Softbank just did this on a massive scale speculatively with many tech stocks.

PLTR steady upwards. Looking good.

I agree with his due diligence but it has been obvious since Sept that recovery stocks not tech are now the play. Tech valuations hit their real peak around labor day. I exited all my tech stocks and moved them into recovery then. I am long these recovery stocks so worse case is I wait longer, I don't think any are in danger of BK. If you look at airlines, hotels, cruise lines (most risky) etc they all have room to run back to 2019 levels.
Could be the lack of stimulus money
Hope you're right. I grabbed some 550$ 11/27 calls that were not cheap!
You are right which makes it so tempting to put some money in.
Trump talking. Exiting my calls
SP isn't a fund or ETF you can just buy.  It's just a listing of 500 stocks.  It's all the funds that track SP that have to buy it up.
Yup. Don't trust anyone without skin in the game. If OP actually believe HIS OWN bullshit, he'd have positions.

Has Elon forsaken us?
A price that balances the premium you‚Äôd like to make on the put at a strike that you feel comfortable buying shares at. I would go slight OTM (18 or 17.5). Chances are high that they would be exercised at the next dip down. The goal is to get paid to buy the shares by the premium (rather than just buying straight out). Once the put is exercised and you have the shares, you sell your covered call.

I mentioned that ticker symbol in the past and I got message that it‚Äôs banned
I ran my optimizer for the case that TTCF is around $17.50 on 4/16/21, here's what it's telling me:

* Buy $2.5 calls for $1390 max.
* Sell $17.5 calls for $310 min.
* Sell $17.5 puts for $490 min.

Overall, you'll have to spend $590 to enter this play and will make a nice profit of $866 if TTCF ends up around $17.50, but anything above $13 is profitable for you. On the other hand, the downside risk up to $2340 is TTCF reaches rock bottom. If you're now willing to take this risk or have a different idea on where TTCF is going, check out my optimizer at [https://velistos.com](https://velistos.com) to calculate the most profitable option strategies.

Maybe the rest of the auto industry shouldn't suck so much.
aht is very close to ath. bullish
Caught the SPY gap up originally, caught the drop from 360-355 this week. In on PLTR last friday when it crashed with ER. CHWY at it's bottom the past week. Caught AMD with some Dec '18 calls today.
PLTR $25 11/27 üöÄüöÄüöÄ
So why didnt S&P announce Tesla's inclusion after they already bought the stock? Instead of announcing a future inclusion, causing a pump and them having to pay more. Would that be an SEC violation or something?
Of course, and it‚Äôs all in 11/20 puts instead

Pricing puts now.
citron got fucked again too, they probably short that shit when they publish it
Depends on how momentum is between 1-2 est. if it‚Äôs still going, we could see a 10 to 15% up day. If it dies down, we will drop. Regardless I would expect it to be below 250 tomorrow. The profit taking from the massive 250 call volume almost guarantees that. Would not be surprised to see below 240 tomorrow either. Around 3-4 est tomorrow is when you wanna get into calls for 11/27. 

My personal feeling is that it‚Äôs making a move to over 300 as the guys on CNBC said. It‚Äôs valuation has traded in lockstep with Pinterest over the last 7 months. Similar revenue, similar kind of investor that buys the stock. Which implies at least 30% upside from current levels.  Roku has a higher revenue growth rate though, and is now actually profitable. On a GAAP basis, not that non GAAP bullshit. So I think it should have a higher valuation than Pinterest. Then again, PINS is certainly overvalued. But how much do you pay for platforms with 50 million users in the case of Roku and >300 million in the case of pins. Monetization means potential exponential revenue growth, therefore profit. Same story as FB, GOOGl. Twtr failed, snap has maybe failed at doing this sort of thing. Time will tell how Roku and pins fair. 

Regardless, when Roku breaks out it usually goes higher than just 10%. So 300 in the very near term is going to happen, imo. Unless market tanks. Look for down day tomorrow, and then big day on Monday. Might be able to get in at open on Monday, but then again move may already be pretty big.
It happened yesterday as well before the sell off started the last 2-3 hours
When did you buy them and held them for 1 week? or why did you buy them ? Good timing is why I am asking.

Some DD for you autists because it is only just over a month to Christmas after all.

The head of the Oxford Vaccine Group said today that efficacy data on the AZN/Oxford vaccine will ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù be released ‚Äúbefore Christmas.‚Äù

When determining what is meant by ‚Äúbefore Christmas‚Äù you should bear in mind that the the last day of term at Oxford University before Christmas is 4 December. Therefore I would expect the timeline he had in mind was not any time before 25 December. It is probably earlier than that. 

The Oxford/AZN vaccine is 3-4 USD according to the sources I have seen. The PFE and MRNA vaccines are much more expensive (I have seen estimates they are ten times the cost of the AZN vaccine). The AZN vaccine requires no special cold chain to transport or store it. Due to those cost and temperature factors it will almost certainly be the vaccine of choice in India and across most of Asia and therefore for most of the world‚Äôs population. 

Make of those pieces of information what you will. I‚Äôm in on AZN calls.

I mean... everything he said is objectively true. The problem is that the market doesn‚Äôt give a shit about what is happening right now because we all know the pandemic will be over this time next year and the fed will be pumping liquidity into the market from now until then. My guess is that the indexes won‚Äôt move much at all because the overvalued ‚Äòstay at home‚Äô stocks will drop while the undervalued epicenter stocks will rise and basically cancel each other out.
No way ...tho I am  short

Your last paragraph makes no sense. Your DD is based off of long-term fundamentals, with some charts stretching years. But you‚Äôre also telling me you‚Äôre going to exit your bearish positions when things ‚Äústabilize‚Äù, ie over a short time frame like 1 month. Fun fact, stocks go up before they go down. So unless you have a clear definition of what stabilization means, this isn‚Äôt a strategy. You just have Google.

So more detail. First is with schwab that I just got two months ago after a layoff with Vanguard. Job feels like a bit of a bait and switch (way more operational than advertised) also I can kind of see my own glass ceiling because it is a niche department in stock plan admin. But it does pay well, and I will feel like a piece of shit for quitting on them after I pretty much just got up to speed. At the same time  the management style is a lot tougher than what I'm used too. The people otherwise are great to work with.

2nd job, again is really just a guys own firm. Already has 80+ clients average over 1mil under management and wants to double that in the next 5-7 years. I would be primarily in charge of investment analysis but will "wear many hats" from admin like opening accounts to marketing which we will partner doing. The guy is also pretty genuine from our meetings. Also seems like if those longer term goals are hit I would become a partner with equity in the firm. I also think I would like this more than my button pushing, high volume, stress/responsibility operations job.

Tough decision. Tbh

You might want to cover your IB username so your employer doesn't fire you.
I don‚Äôt know. No argument, this company is dog shit. However, if I was Trevor Milton, I wouldn‚Äôt sell when the lock up expires. Everyone is expecting him and others to dump shares when the lock up period ends....but why? EV is rocking lately running in to an EV friendly president. Gm deal I believe is still on the table. If I‚Äôm Trevor Milton, I‚Äôm not dumping everything. I‚Äôm selling a few to be comfortable and then letting it ride. I might be wrong. Everyone is convinced this is going to fall off a cliff. As it should. I don‚Äôt know if that will actually be the case though. We will see.

It's definitely a long position because like how India has been booming on social media apps because of their rising internet user base I definitely see the youth and the continent as a whole embracing technology.

You ever tried to cut a tiny sausage with one hand?
Quicker and less regulatory hoops to jump though. So many Tech companies can take advantage of all this craziness in the market and get rid of their equity before the inevitable drop occurs.
Every time you read something here pumping it up or trashing it, do your due diligence (dd).

If you want to actually make money, you have to think of this as like you're an investigator. You need to understand all angles and gather all the info to make educated assessments and informed decisions. Even then you'll still get some wrong.

If you still have accounts with them, I‚Äôd specially call the active trader number and request to initiate a trade dispute based on that specific trade. Have all the details ready like trade date, time, and if you can what the fill should‚Äôve been. They take their service and their trade disputes super seriously. Tell them that you called about this before and tell them you feel it didn‚Äôt get handled properly.

I‚Äôm going to go ahead and say this post is mostly true just because 98% of WSB is calling it retarded. When a gay bear post is agreed upon by WSB, you know the market is gonna sky rocket. When a bear post is met with pure bullish sentiment, it‚Äôs Pokimane calling the top again. I haven‚Äôt been selling all my positions but my bill positions have been smaller and smaller with a bit more cash holding going on.
Good to show the day's support levels. Also I mostly watch the 1 minutes on the daily
Nobody meming PLTR anymore?
And let's be clear here. I'm not talking about practical numbers or facts, I'm talking about the same hype that drove the stock to 90 in the first place. That made no fucking sense either.

But if you're worried about a 3000 refresh suddenly smashing AMD off the board and killing that hype, don't be. Look at how the repsective cards are clocking. The 3000 series is pretty much tapped out out of the box, not a lot of overhead for overclockers to reach for and the silicon is already clean, so there won't be significant improvements in die quality or yield.

AMD is the exact opposite. Golden cards are popping up everywhere and OC'ers are taking their little red rockets to the moon. The die quality and yield will improve significantly over time, costs will come down and AMD will remain competitive on all levels. That kind of hype takes market share from the competitor.

Ask me how many times I've watched this happen, for both sides.
Fuck off
Anyone have a link to this mango conference?
ya i hope youre right
Me too. I mean I‚Äôll take it but wonder what happened.
I bought yesterday and today it has been moving sideways. Sure it went up and down a few 10 cents but it never reached 20. I guess it must be because the rocket ship is still being fueled.

Tesla hits bottom in Consumer Reports survey
Tesla Inc. fell by two spots in Consumer Reports Magazine‚Äôs annual reliability study after its Model Y crossover was reported to have body-hardware and paint issues.

Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports stated these are not typical problems for new models and added it is "really disappointing when you spend this much money for a car and hopefully they‚Äôll be able to rectify a lot of these as time goes by."

Tesla is now at the 25th spot out of 26 brands rated in the US market. The last one is Ford Motor Co‚Äôs Lincoln luxury brand.

Bet safely on Tesla!
I wish I still had this faith that in some desk somewhere, someone actually knows shit.

I agree with you, but I also agree with OP. However, "time in the market > timing the market".
No
I thnk the move here is actually 01/15/2021 Nio calls, which I will hammer next time it drops. The reason is Nio day is 01/09/2021 and they usually unveil another car and have huge turn out, this is the move.

Used his TSLA tendies to make sure the price stays up
Is pltr ever gonna hit 19?
I bought it, actually did some research, then immediately sold because it's just a pump and dump. Managed to gtfo near the top of the pump though so no complaints.

dude, you're embarrassing yourself.

FED has been promising inflation due to their QE policies since 2012.Never happened.  Come on.  


Market yields 7% YoY, consumer inflation has been around 2-3% historically.
CIIC dumping
Doesn't there need to be a catalyst for a crash anyways? What, if anything, could that catalyst be? A lockdown won't happen and if it did, Joey B would fund everything.

today is the MM giving a win to some WSB favorites, AMD, NIO, BABA, TSLA all having nice days
Why is PSTH drilling?
Its survivorship bias which is why it is always good that people post losses on here as well. But you see the one guy who took 10K to 100K on a YOLO and you think "oh I can do that" and poof you have $100 left. I wish I could find this post where this guy took sub 100K to 1MM but he talked about how weeklies and SPY yolos really were just throwing money away.

I think youre confusing your dads shlong with useful fundamental indicators
If a little intra-day drop in TSLA worries you, play some other ticker.

PLTR with the loch ness shaped recovery
Imagine not buying that tsla dip
Well, that‚Äôs enough DD for me. Sign me the fuck up.
I can explain

First, it dipped to give my puts hope

Then when they reached breakeven, I didn't set a stop loss even though I knew spy would pump.

It did.

Then I diamond handed until they broke even again on the second dip. I didn't sell even though I swore to the bear God that I would.

SPY pumps again

Next, I bought oneore put at the third peak, and then when it dipped back down to almost breakeven, I bought a call as a hedge for the next inevitable pump.

Now SPY will be eternally stuck at 355.60
I‚Äôm a woman :)
Spy keeps making lower highs
Bruh I sold plug at $4. 300 shares
Thank you for buying the Tesla dip, come again
Oh lol, thought you had shares

Yes if you want to learn about options the guy to talk to there is VisceralAce.  There's a free social room you can tag him in, cant say he will answer if not on trial or membership though.  I just stick with day and swinging shares but he has like a 90% win rate on options so.  There's also a lot of documentation on it in the university section about day trading them.

Whatever you do, POSITIONS OR BAN, thank you

Still feels oversold. Every bit of vaccine news on the horizon will boost it because it means we're closer to the getting the foot traffic (still a ways off from gen pop of course), but the pattern seems to be rotation out of growth to value which seems to be CVS realm.

I also think investors will remember that CVS crushed earnings and  have a very well integrated company in healthcare. Amazon Pharmacy is a pretty big disruption but I don't see why CVS can't find a new home north of 70 or beyond.

While you are correct that drive through restaurants benefit, the ones i mentioned are not drive throughs. EAT is the parent company of Chilli's, they are not a fastfood restaurant.

Yea its pretty thin. But investors are fickle and will be leaning on that meeting for news. Just may be the catalyst that dumps it. I am willing to try it.

Tesla FD calls obviously
Just sell puts on it.

TSLA is free money rn
A bull case for chain restaurants is that the pandemic and shutdowns have hurt them but have hurt small or independent restaurants even more. I am super long $MCD because their franchisees are well capitalized and can better survive right now due to drive thru, delivery, and access to capital compared to mom and pop shops. When things get more normal, lots of restaurants would have died but the chains will likely still be open and take all those additional sales.

About to short amd there has to be a sell off
Time to wait and see what tesla decides to do. Looks like its about ready to be bought and launch to 510.
That AMD dildo was nothing short of heroic
Did you not read OP? So I argue his case on the side of buying TLT (a 30 yr bond ETF), and I think it's important to know that the market is not a reflection of the economy. He makes a much better case for it than I can, but: QE turns liquid assets into illiquid assets "owned" by the banks. This is, by nature, deflationary. 

From the side of SPY: QE artificially raises stock prices. The ECONOMY is in the tank right now, but the MARKET is sky-high. Basically, Steven is arguing (from what I understand) that the bubble is going to pop and we will see a major market correction because of this. 

Again, he may be wrong. Many people disagree with him, but I'm yoloing on the guy with ausbergers who isn't as blinded by perma-bulls as other stock advisors. iirc, the first guy to foresee the '08 crash was also on the spectrum, no?
Surprised you never mentioned Covid. Europe has shut down and crashed some of their markets (see Germany). NYC schools just don't their kids home...only a matter of time before city & state shut downs start here.
That‚Äôs true for any investing at anytime. You have a 75% of it going up if you give yourself about 13 months

Tesla buying back up 510 eod
news?
I'm not sure it has to do with luck as much as it does with buying calls on something that's run up 25% in 3 days.
YO WHAT AMD NEWS DROPPED??? I have one shitty call and it is looking nice
Bought a call right when it was $507...
these dusty calls i bought awhile back may not be so dead after all :,)
[removed]
Is nio dead
Feel like ackman is the type of guy that wants you to doubt him and then WHAM come out with some groundbreaking news to give a fat W to the ones that never doubted him... One can hope anyways lol
I ran my optimizer for the case that Tesla is around $600 by Christmas, here's what it's telling me:

* Buy $20 calls for $48810 max.
* Sell $600 calls for $2175 min.
* Sell $600 puts for $11495 min.

Overall, it costs you $35140 to enter this play, which make you a solid $22860 if Tesla reached 600 dollars. Plus you'll be able to post some nice gain porn as lang as Telsa is above $486. However, should Tesla do the old HRTZ move for whatever reason, you'd be producing some hard 91k loss porn.

So this play obviously isn't for everybody since the buy-in price is so high and the balls required to pull it off must be quite big. If you want to know a most profitable strategy with a limited max loss or if you aren't as bullish on Papa Elon's money printer as u/ThatKarmaWhore , check out my option strategy optimizer over at [https://velistos.com](https://velistos.com)

I held VXX calls from July until the end of October and it pissed me off beyond belief. Since VXX tracks Vix futures contracts (average 1 month maturity) and not the actual Vix it can either work or completely diverge from the actual Vix. I don't like the daily exposure reset either. I was able to make back some of my loss on September 2-3 on the correction but other than that it didn't go up for shit, even when the Vix was spiking pre-election. I'm shorting using calls on the -3x leveraged ProShares funds so I can actually win when my predictions are correct.

NIO, I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôve been telling you but it‚Äôs not true
no, you just lack nuance. I understand they have an app, and I understand their streaming charts aren't HTML.

My point is that they aren't hosting like 4k streaming video like netflix, or massive gaming servers like blizzard. People are fucking going and looking at a chart and probably transferring like 500kb of data. It shouldn't be hard to host servers that can handle it without crashing every 10 minutes.

Yes the cases are high, yes the unemployment is high and yes the vaccine distribution is going to take longer than what the public believes, but the stock market is speculative and the speculation here is that the US will come out alright. 

I don‚Äôt think we will see any REAL swing in either direction until Biden comes into office and we finalize the house votes. That‚Äôs going to set most of the tone moving forward. For now, people‚Äôs assets are safe but should look to move to cash gang in a few months lol
25x PLTR $26 12/18 do it u won‚Äôt
Are you out of your mind? I am a long holder in this stock but there is 0% chance that 1 army contract brings this stock 5x. Govt contracts aren't even a big source of profits. They would need to bring in multiple big contracts this year to make the stock double. You may want to tame your expectations.
Imagine diamond handing your one Tesla call and later having it rug pulled ü§°ü§°ü§°
The fact that we don‚Äôt have a program to dispense weekly cash to businesses based off of their income statements for the preceding 12 months before covid is sad. It‚Äôs been 8 months. This country is a joke

people betting on the new ev companies to get a large part of the future auto market. some will obviously fail and some succeed. noone knows which ones
Now this is pod racing! $TSLA
The volatility is high, what positions are you holding?
Corrections start with $TSLA...
That pop on lack of news for PSTH just convinced me to buy more as soon as it drops back below 22

Ha Ha real funny TSLA... now go back up
You'll know which one by 4:00 today

But without $10 kale shots for the buy side I just don't see how we can possibly go any higher

The only guarantee is that no matter what happens today you'll end up üí¶üí¶üí¶ tonight

That stock is dead man. I realized my 98.6% loss. I'm not touching anything Chinese unless it's food or women and even that I'm skeptical
EOSE is primed to continue its 7% day. New battery tech seems to be hot right now.
I don‚Äôt think it will drop big tomorrow. It might be either flat or up

Make trading great again!

TA is what all new/naive traders use. Everyone thinks TA is useful when they first start trading. Then, as you get older and gain more trading experience, you realize it is utter bullshit. I thought TA was useful for probably a good 8 years before I completely accepted that it‚Äôs bogus.

FU Putin . I am buying tesla more
I've been sitting on a 6/18/21 20c from your first post. The worst part is the $600 I was going to put into PLTR, I put in this instead, and only put $150 into PLTR since everyone here was crying about them not making profit for years.


I don't mind, this is a long term play, just wish I had freed up more capital so I didn't have to make that choice.

Lol, let me know when Tesla can make an infotainment system that doesn't brick itself.

There seems to be a large disconnect between Tesla owners and Tesla investors and if Tesla cannot improve their quality, reliability, and services to their owners, they may just end up with a customer loyalty problem.
Will Chaynuh let BABA keep dumping? They're either gonna gobble up the dip or sell hard and rotate to other companies. What do you think?
So I just spoke to charles schwab about purchasing SRACW for the upcoming momentus merger. They kept warning me that you can't know what the warrants are for until a later date. Are they just saying this in case the deal falls through before completion or is there something else I'm missing? They said the warrants could end up being for something completely else and we don't know what yet. That seems odd.

longer term charts look bearish a bit but I could se a 1% upside in SPY over the next 2 days.
I think you are bang on except the timing. The market will keep heading higher into bubble territory before finally dropping. If you can see this so can everyone else and that means the obvious play is to go short. Once all the shorts get squeezed out and all that liquidity is trapped then the next leg down will start imo

I've been in the PC gaming market for a long time. Nvidia won't cannibalize their 3090 sales with the 3080 Ti. They've gone through a lot of trouble in the past to avoid that and won't start now.

I fucked myself so bad trying to hedge

I don't see the correlation between that event and NKLA but ok. Good luck
Who just shit on walmart wtffffff
corsair, tesla, pltr. But like ASAP. The longer you wait the higher they'll go and the more you'll hate yourself. Don't trust meme stonks like chinese EVs. Whether they're right or wrong, they're too risky for a babby who just started and has 3k to work with.
$GIK is the next one. Halted today. Going public rumor is out
AMD said bring back tech
Good statement from him.  "Look at the 13Fs and decide if you think it's a good sign or not. Also remember not everyone invested has filed 13Fs"
explain gme i retard
not rly. i got +20% on solo today
It was almost me man
Final summary. Spoke for around 2 minutes. Basically said they can‚Äôt mention the IPO. The investors list speaks for itself. And they originally set a 6 month timeframe when talking IPO and that puts them at releasing name in Q1 2021 and they are on pace to meet that timeframe.
It was announced Money after hours and still ran up on Wednesday during cash session... no real excuse to be salty. I missed the run up too oh well.
Okay so buy calls, got it
Nobody wants to listen because they're bearphobic but thank you for speaking the truth

The good DD and interesting reads may be gone, but at least WSB still gets the wildlife.
This meme never gets old no matter how many variations appear.
Well you see, someone found some old news about NKLA and GM and thought it was new news, so people bought more NKLA so the number of bag holders has increased.  Your puts are far enough out you'll be fine
What‚Äôs up with all these people talking about NAKD? Y‚Äôall think this shit is gonna rocket soon?
I also saw this meme on Instagram
Lol rip tech.

Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
Well commercial loans are different. And you need to consider your DTI if that‚Äôs actually possible.

But yeah, real estate investing is definitely the move for building wealth
What are your positions?  Seem like a guy I would follow blindly.
People see that shit is fucked and have defaulted to the retarded "tech is safe!" mindset. Because for some reason, people absolutely refuse to short or simply sit on the sidelines. They feel like they have to buy, every single day.

It's the death throes of a huge downturn incoming.
[deleted]
That's a high margin product.
The AMD chart is bananas!
This is the biggest dip we're going to see on tesla. Now is the time to go in on it. The fact that such a steep drop didnt trigger a selloff should prove its strength. On top of that technicals signaled a strong buy as soon as it happened. People are buying. You should too.
Positions or ban
I'll be so fucking happy when the EV bubble eventually pops and this board isn't clogged with the same Elon cum guzzling commentary every day.
What a life to be able to accidentally spend 200k
The fucking title about it being a quick options trade wasn't a give away?
In this thread: OP ignores the possibility of further fiscal stimulus in the US and, well, everything about other countries. I mean, it‚Äôs not like he said US stimulus wasn‚Äôt likely with the current screwed up US political situation, which is an understandable (although probably incorrect) position to take, he just flat out ignored it. Also, there are economies out there other than the US. Some of them are even doing pretty well at dealing with the whole COVID thing. Major flaws in the thesis.
Today's fucking choppy, I'm just not gonna look at the market and hope for z best.
I do not think they will. And speculating when they do not some action on the price.
Ban this commie bastard
Someone from here probably loaded up on puts and a real player wiping them out

Any dip buy????? Or it‚Äôs all bull run!!!
Got in at the top still holding though
Well I bought calls, and so far anytime I buy calls I lose money. So maybe switch to puts.
Ok hold up
Yeah I mean I‚Äôm fine with it. I‚Äôve put 75 total in my account to fuck around wit and now I‚Äôm at 800. Might be gambling but it‚Äôs making me money so

TSLA 520 EOD
But you forgot that he has an Eagle Scout Award, from Boy Scouts of America. This changes everything. A super gay bear is telling us to sell, so obviously we inverse that. It could not be more clear.
Depends on the company and climate. Deep OTM calls on weed before election hype? Cool. Buying OTM calls on a stock that‚Äôs already run up 10% on no new? Not cool.
AMD has yuuuge problems with stock, even bigger than nvidia. Their raytracing and pr suck. Nvidia isn‚Äôt as tone deaf as intel and they will be selling Ti or super versions of their current 3000 series that will be even better in performance than amds 6000 series. Just so you know
18.50, I have no interest in this company but the hype will keep it pumping. I only care about the massively inflated premium.

Nah I'm not playing with TSLA anymore. SBE and CIIG are the new games.
Anyone else remember when this stock was $7000/share? Or are y'all on Robinhood and can only see 5 years in the past?

I do it for growth-oriented companies I believe in. MSFT is what I‚Äôm in rn, have $275c for 01/2022
Remember to buy calls on friday to hold over the weekend to take advantage of the next vaccine coming out on monday.
Ever since I started taking profits where I could get them my account has been consistently green. Odd.

Fugg you Boeing
Saw some people questioning whether it‚Äôs more worth to exercise the calls at a certain point. I think I‚Äôll take the profit around what I was talking about and maybe reinvest in CRSR, stand strong

Yeah this guy should buy like 3 houses and rent them out.
i guess calls on TSLA never goes wrong, does it
The thing that sucks about autistic fucks like this one losing money is that it doesn't really contribute positively to the economy. Like outside of this person's sheer comedic stupidity, him losing this kind of money doesn't positively flow into the economy.

At least when you blow your money on material items, no matter how fucking stupid a purchase you made, you're contributing to the economy. Here this autistic fuck is simply making money vanish (in the form of valuation dropping).

Losing stock money is like being a shitty magician i guess
That BLNK pump gave me ACB flashbacks

Man i think im about to let yall have it with these options. To us common folk these are just lotto tickets. Some get lucky but most crash and burn. Thankfully ive gotten lucky more than ive lost money. But just knowing that more than a handful of people had knowledge about tesla being included in the s&p500 and being able to take advantage of it. Im not talking about how we were back in September before the crash and everyone was speculating but etsy got included instead. Im talking about people who knew for sure ahead of time.


Tldr: im quiting options until i find a forum on the deepweb or something with insider trading knowledge because im salty that people with real insider trading knowledge keep winning.

If not announced I am betting on a pullback. Then again if announced it will spike.
That‚Äôs not really a green day BABA. Please go to 260.

My frustration is people that buy weeklies expecting 100%+ gains where on the chart do you ever see that in a weekly basis? The only time you see 100% is when you‚Äôre weeklies FDs expired -100%. I know I don‚Äôt expect a lot from you guys cause come in here to lose money but learn how to read a chart and learn how to trade. Okay that is all.

Oh and for people holding share that goes for you as well don‚Äôt expect to become over night millionaires people that made money with hold stock shares make over YEARS with some exceptions of course.

My guy, this is your fourth bear DD in 2 months. Stop trying to make red happen.
Mortgage rates are basically 0 right now. It honestly makes way more sense to borrow as much as possible. You can get residential loans at like 2.5%. You can easily make more than that with the rest of the money.

When do you guys actually considering buying deep OTM calls as a viable strategy? I'm drawn to OTM calls cos they're cheaper and my broke ass can't afford 3 month ATM calls.
I have no idea what any of that means, just tell me what to throw my money at.
oooops, thx for tanking it
Elon you fucking bitch
But if you think about it, in just the right way. Isn't that the same as a month?
They expire tomorrow!  Bro the MM's got 11/20 pinned for max pain... RIP to your puts.
i could use a 23 to break even
I'm thinking about it, but don't want to challenge EVs anytime soon. I'm thinking about buying NKLA puts because it's a joke.
and down goes FCEL
1st day back after 4 months down 50% ahhh it feels good to be home
Could you expand on that? What price puts would I sell?
HAHAHAHAH. Seriously though, wait for 1h until ending to buy puts for only that hour, sell before close. And then calls again for monday
The most retarded thing I can think of right now is to buy YOLO calls so that‚Äôs probably the play. 74.1% of retail investors lose money so looks like I might be one of the 25.9%

An actual African here from Borno state Nigeria. In the most developed countries only a fraction of the population buy things online let alone know how to use or even where to buy a cellphone. Literally no one except for the financially elite (not even 25% of the population) make online purchases. Sadly, even some of those have trust issues with online purchasing.
But nio is great in reality
Yes exactly, and they are getting investigated for some type of securities fuckery if I remember correctly

this dude honestly kinda has me convinced... ironically though I think there's a good chunk of us aware that we're in this bubble and just riding it out hoping to not get burned.

Like obviously my fucking NIO calls are supremely overvalued. but there's power in knowing the retards in here will keep buying.
[deleted]
I mean, EV's are hot, but that doesn't erase FSR's track record of being a completely and utterly inept company.
I've invested elsewhere and I have made money; I bought NIO relatively early. I still think Tesla is an epic bubble, but I don't try to predict when the bubble will pop. Elon is cool, and I love SpaceX, but he doesn't seem stable enough for me to bet my savings on. Also Tesla is worth more than Toyota, my instinct is to short Tesla but I've decided to not even touch it.
why? it's so strong
Do I close out my 11/20 AMZN $3100/3095 put spreads now while they‚Äôre at 50%, or hold for a little more tomorrow?
Could SOLO puts print? It‚Äôs up fucking 50% in a week
It‚Äôs literally been on the market since September, you fucking retard.

You are correct. But you said it yourself, " The market has become divorced from the overall economy."

The market does it what it does. The party will go on, with ups and downs. 

Does it deserve to be lower, yes. Will it? Maybe.

> Remember last Christmas Tesla was rocking ~425 then our boy Ellie released the cybertruck. Tesla flew to 600 by eow.

You're off by a bit. When the Cybertruck was unveiled on 11/21, TSLA was around $350, but it never broke $450 before the end of the year, let alone $600 by the end of that week.

Edit: Just checked the exact date TSLA broke $600, because I was curious - Jan 30th.

I agree with this. I have both. And both account is red. But I do like webull a little bit more. I feel like their transaction to buy or sell is faster than robinhood. I also like their charts and account detail to show how much I lost. Robinhood is simple and UI is user friendly.

Bad play. Should've gotten the spreads when it was in the 440s
I have owned shares of PLAY since late March. My portfolio is primarily long. However, I believe by watching it in the past the 11/20 23.50 Put is a good gamble right now at .38. I have 8 with an entry of .19. In the past it seems to fall on option expiration Friday.

Have you read the court documents? These clowns have people saying stuff like "someone (who i wont name) told me that someone (who they wont name) told them to do a bad thing! Here's a sticky note to prove it!"

Basic research tells anyone objective this entire thing is just bunk meant to rile up his base
Yep. Ran up from 400-500 in three trading days. Definitely dead.
It was a great stock to get into a week ago because it traded sideways for so long there were nice stop loss levels. I bought a little at $2.63 and just happened to time it but figured it could trade sideways a long time. Sold 1/4 at $4.97 yesterday. It reminds me of PLUGs rise. Bought that at $5 and sold at $10 because i was up 100% so quickly. Could be the same thing here but I've set more stops to take profit. Can't watch a 100% gain turn to a loss. 

I lucked into finding the stock basically. 

There are still problems with hydrogen. Why bother making hydrogen with clean energy when regular battery development seems like the way to go. It feels like more desperation to catch up to TSLA, but admittedly the play for hydrogen is more likely things like heavy equipment. Imagine setting up a hydrogen plant in Canada's tar sands and running the mining and oil extraction equipment off that instead of diesel. 

Go to Yahoo finance and look at the 4 year financials chart. Disaster. I'll ride the wave while it lasts and then probably not look back.

Let this serve as a reminder to you morons in the back; trade $SPY after hours and pre-market. Sell your options at open and buy back at close. This shit is simple.
Wish I‚Äôd done it before whatever the fuck is happening now
Now what's the tldr of the opposite side of your argument?

All the big money investors already know this. The facts are indisputable. The ability to have the can kicked further down the road is what I‚Äôm putting my money on, and why I‚Äôm still making bullish investments. This bubble is a little more transparent than prior bubbles and I think an exit strategy will easier if you‚Äôre keeping an eye on all of these indicators.
Then short it... positions or ban.

So, will be having two presidents be bullish? What was $TSLA doing circa 1860s Civil War time?
You & Brent are both wrong. You are literally a gay bear in the middle of a bull market. 

QE in and of itself isnt deflationary, its a monetary response to lower borrowing rates in the RESPONSE to a deflationary shock, like COVID, like the GFC.

You can argue that the response doesnt match the shock, so maybe you get NET deflation, however, if the FED did this same thing during ‚Äúgood times‚Äù it would def create big inflation.

Heres the thing, even if you‚Äôre right, and QE creates deflation in and of itself (which is ass backwards), perception is reality in markets.

Thats how reflexive relationships work. A La Soros.
If everyone believe stocks go up, then they do.

They might need to purchase 122m, or the equivalent, by that date, but there is no telling how many shares they either already own or are being purchased via dark pools. Because we don't know this number I don't think it is safe to assume they need to acquire all 122. I think it is likely they need far less. I don't want to give a truly astronomical prediction, because the very volatile behavior I predict will occur right before inclusion kinda keeps anyone from giving a solid educated guess this far out.

Everything he said is 100% accurate and will happen. 

The key is timing it. Unless you time it absolutely correct you will get fucked. Most people will not.
You say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a bear, I follow the market‚Äù yet all your posts are gay. What gives?
All of your premises seem good but your conclusion is not. The market is more irrational than ever, so it‚Äôs a bad idea to use logic and reasoning and complex shit like that to come to your conclusion.

The drop won‚Äôt just happen on its own. My sense is this is the beginning of a euphoric bull run, not the end. The only thing that‚Äôs stopping this bull run is an unexpected disruptive catalyst. At this point, election uncertainty, record coronavirus cases, lockdowns, all of these are expected and accounted for. So what kind of catalyst am I talking about? 

Well, who knows? It‚Äôs hard to predict the unexpected. My biggest concern is Chinese aggression or invasion against Taiwan during the American transition of power. 

Throw some uncertainty into the mix with these almost universal irrational valuations and we can see an explosive drop

If you have long calls the make a profit would it better to exercise the options instead of selling them?
There is no downside to taking his advice (outside of the options, in which case there is risk). The way I see it, there are a 2 variables: take his advice or not, he is right or wrong, buy options or not (as a subcategory of whether or not you take his advice). Broken down:

1.) he is right, you take his advice and buy options: make money. OR, if you don't buy options and simply pull from the market, stocks are cheap after the dip and you have tons of liquidity. 

2.) He is right, you don't take his advice: you lose 20% of your gains and it puts you in the red for a couple of months. 

3.) he is wrong, you take his advice and buy options: your options expire worthless and you are out proportional to your option contracts. OR, if you don't buy options, you miss a week to a month of market trading. 

4.) he is wrong, you don't take his advice: yeet, you got to stay in the market for a couple weeks with no downside. 

However, I have to say that his DD looks good. I know this is a meme-ish subreddit that fully encapsulates the modern fusion of entertainment and information, but his shit should be taken seriously, and there just isn't a proven method yet to go full bear while remaining memable until it is too late. I am 100% on his side here. I've been following Steven for the past couple months and he really does know his shit. He might be wrong, anyone may be, but I have good reason to believe that he is more correct in market trading than others. 

For me, I bought TLT (because I am stupid and risk-averse and don't want to get into options trading) at its low a couple weeks ago @155$ and I have only seen it go up ever since.

If you want my unironic trading strategy: I trust Russians when they talk about chess, gay men when they talk about art, and autistics when they talk about the market (related side-note: look up his youtube channel. For me, the fact that he doesn't shill it speaks to his integrity.) Steven is right, and if you want to avoid the coming dip listen to him. 

All in all though, you can't go wrong. Stocks will EVENTUALLY return back to where they are now, but many stocks still haven't gotten back to pre-lockdown levels. With all the market indicators AND the news AND this DD, I think it is worth it to pull back for a couple weeks until at least after Thanksgiving/Christmas. TBH, I am hoping for airlines and TSLA to take a nosedive so I can score some cheapies with (nearly) guaranteed long-term returns. 

Final point: Steven is worth listening to BECAUSE he doesn't day-trade. Day traders get too caught up in the ebbs and flows of the weekly shit; he does macro. I don't listen to him to know which specific stocks are going up or down, I listen to him to know general market trends (his Sunday night market charts are fuckin' choice, my dudes). 

To Steven: This place is a meme-zone. I can guarantee that the people who are taking your advice aren't posting, and the rest are still giving you shit because that's the meme (perma-bull). To draw from a religious source (gasp): there is a reason it was so common to say, "whoever has ears, let them hear"; it's just that some people just don't have the ears for this. Wisdom is wasted on them who don't listen.
Try NIO $55 or $60 expiring tomorrow.

Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money You Retards  <- ***yes it can***

Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary <- ***this one is true but who cares***

Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting  <- ***meehhhhh not really. There was a ton of cash taken out early in March-May and now companies and consumers have more way cash than they know what to do with. Check the Quick Ratio of SPY and money market dollars***

Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks <- ***wut, banks have to load up on bonds. Hedge funds are still piling in and loading up on stocks, that's not retail***

Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High <- ***who gives a fuck***

I didn't say that very well.  Just the general concept of buying on margin.  Put $1 cash into the account, invest it in $2 of stocks using margin.  They go up 10%.  Sell, and now you have $1.20 in cash, doubling your gains.  

So, my stock picks went up by 25%, but my account value went up by 50%.

Yeah I‚Äôm hoping for an EOY run up so I can collect fat OTM premiums. Tbh I was disappointed that they are doing a buyback instead of a dividend and i read an article where even I think it was JPM said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what we want, pay a dividend‚Äù. I think they know that they need to do something with all that cash and like you said, I‚Äôm hoping that will be the catalyst
You have spoken the word of God. Rkt is cursed for originating in Motown which still carries a gloomy hangover of 2008 crash and having hq in city that went bankrupt doesn't help it's cause.

There is no hype/publicity here to attract fancy hedge funds or big money players. There are loose rumors of grandpa Buffet sinking his dentures into rkt, but hey odds are he will kick the bucket before it happens.   It is valued at garbage and it will remain so for quite some time.

Ps: I yolo'd 28k into 12/18 24c for earnings play, had to cut losses and bail out with half of initial investment.

We are facing a runoff election in Georgia that will determine the fate of the Senate. The party will deploy it's massive grassroots campaign machine in the state over the next month. There will be new polls and a second runup, pricing a potential blue wave as we near the election, which will be decided on Jan. 5. 

To me, the most obvious play has to be cannabis, right?

TLRY is oversold at the bottom of its bollinger band.  If nothing else, IV will start trickling up shortly. Even if I'm wrong, this play seems low risk. If I'm right, it's extremely high reward. buying OTM momentum calls.  This is my official triple clown ü§°ü§°ü§° buy alert

BILI up 20 fucking percent. Should‚Äòve held through earnings.
600 12/18
this was my initial read as well, but it did better than expected in earnings by a solid amount (still a decent loss). It tanked early, and then went on an absolute rip for a net gain of 8% from the daily low. since its 1dte i dont want to let it get out of hand in case it sits around yesterdays highs. I keep relying on it being macy's and therefore a company not really prepared for a covid world.

Old news
So maybe you‚Äôve heard the bank of japan was buying OTM calls in the millions. This was raising gamma which means market makers like citadel had to hedge, they bought underlying stocks. Right? That‚Äôs how we got the huge run up of august now SoftBank is unwinding their balance sheet. Meaning they are dumping their calls and going cash which will force market makers to start dumping their shares.
Well, what you learned this week might not work next week. Anyway GG
I‚Äôm still loading up on 12/31s for one final play. I believe that there will be a catalyst that cannot be held down. I‚Äôve heard a few people on here talking about them getting into auto loans or making an acquisition with all that cash they have lying around. 

The CEO was also pretty confused about the stocks price action. Im thinking that he‚Äôs scrambling to find anything he can to propel the stock.

B I t coin is on webull now

I can officially talk about it here
Huge dip ok CRSR time to jump in?
Wait, what ? ‚Äú im new to investing ‚Äú . 

You‚Äôr on the wrong sub dude
Because the higher it goes the more likely consolidation. 

And it‚Äôs been awhile since consolidation?
Must be some solid literature
Fuck is wrong with baba
Honestly if I held my positions that I sold for profit I would actually be making money smh
I also have both because of day trading rules. If you have no reason to switch from RH, don‚Äôt. Webul sucks.
OH. MY. GOD. PEOPLE.  IT'S UTMOST, NOT UPMOST!

I wish these hands held onto my TSLA 500C... I exited my position with 100% gain at 480.  If I held and sold today, it'd be mucho higher!

Spent 7 months of it staring at lines and numbers. Good shit.
I‚Äôll only sell covered calls when I believe the shares are trading higher than they ought to and really wouldn‚Äôt care about losing my shares at that price.  I‚Äôve got burned a couple times with CC‚Äôs when the underlying goes up 25% in a week and my CC was 5% OTM.  If I sell 25% OTM, I‚Äôm collecting pennies.  In the off chance that RKT goes up 25%, it‚Äôs probably equally as likely to go up 40%.  Potentially missing that extra 15% isn‚Äôt worth collecting $12. 

If RKT gets to $27 or so, I‚Äôll start selling CCs at $30 strike.
RemindMe! 4 days
AYRO isn‚Äôt a penny stock anymore.   Let‚Äôs goooooooo

Margin my friend. Gamble with the bank‚Äôs money.

Its ok PLTR, as long as you hit 20 before you expire in December you can take your time
Cvna doing yoga
*sigh* or not
Absolutely none.  I'm just going with my method of not fighting the energy trends.
Yea, fuck it.
The inflation is almost all in properties and equities.
I'm sorry to inform you PLTR already hit it's high of the day today at 11am est, as is customary most days. 

The correct play is to always YOLO weeklies 5 minutes before close, and if the stock gaps up overnight, then sell around 11am.  This strat would have had you finally eating 20 pack chicken strips

Use profits from first fd to continue daily yoloing with the trend until the music stops
Dude you are making bank man, glad I followed you into this trade ‚úåÔ∏è

Why take such short expiry dates? if you really think its going to crash in the next two months why not go for march or april and just eat the theta?
The investment banks are shorting RKT.  Why?  Because they do all the loan originations.  And they know they're going to keep not lending.

It's getting harder and harder to get a mortgage.
Welp I‚Äôm out, up 30 percent on the week. Not great, not bad. I always take Fridays off. Hopefully I‚Äôll have at least a 50 percent week next week

Let me throw a theoretical situation:  


Government decides on a $10 trillion infrastructure bill to boost the economy. The banks buy up the debt, hand the Federal government cash, the Fed buys up the debt using bank reserves, the banks can use reserves to make loans, i.e. they are in the same positions as before.

The only difference between this situation and the situation before is that the government will spend $10 trillion of money. Explain to me how this is not printing money?

The amount of people on here that just throw their money into options without knowing what they‚Äôre doing is insane. I get it you see that gain porn and you‚Äôre like why not me? Well heres why not you, probably bought way OTM and expirations around the corner because it was cheap. Better than pissing away small amounts of dollars at a time why not take the time and effort to put up a little more money and give yourself an actual chance and understanding of making money. Or at least be able to understand why you lost and make a change for your next play. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get shit on for trying to help maybe one person but whatever, this video is simple, short, and to the point Good luck get tendies
When they're ridiculously wide, yeah.
Exactly. It's getting irritating watching it trade sideways.
the stock probably until my march 5c expires, and then my dec 5c i dont have much of a choice, I dont want to roll it, theres cheaper buys at the point plus tax

IMO these analyst predictions are just pie in the sky pump and dump nonsense. Yeah sure Tesla might hit those numbers just as long as they have no problems at all and no competition at all. They've had tons of problems and they have tons of competition (which people seem to ignore). There are countless companies working on self driving, and countless battery companies too. People are pricing Tesla like it'ss going to have 100% market share in those fields, which is nonsense.

Cummins transitioning to hydrogen is a massive step forward, and I think a lot of other companies will step forward as well. Considering Cummins generators are in a large market share of work trucks, back-up building generators, and god knows what other shit the demand for hydrogen cells will sky rocket. If I'm given the option to swap my backup generator to hydrogen when my service is due, I would gladly pay for the service. I have positive long term outlook, but I think I'm probably going to fully exit this week and rebuy when the pump is over.

Yea the video is a little dumbed down, but I feel like they do it on purpose. Good luck!

I like having both because of the day trading rules. In Webull if you only trade with settled cash then there's no violation. But you have to work with the T+1 and T+2 settlement delay. If my settled cash is low I can run a play in RH and not have to worry about hitting the RH 3 day trade limit since it's not my primary.

Gotcha. I looked at the April ones, liked the higher risk/reward pay off for the January one.

This is honestly one of those option plays you just sit on. They are hard to do if you are use to buying weeklies but I think this is a no brainer.
Investing in one shady Chinese company is enough and we all know which one that is.
Do other brokerages also just auto set your option buy/sell price halfway between the bid and ask? Because you can pretty much always get a better price than the mark if the bid ask is wide at all. Seems like a RH scam.
CRSR looks like its finished its bull run. What retard powered stock is next? JMIA has technology in its name and tech only goes up so that looks decent. Any other suggestions?

Their vaccine sounds great but data doesn‚Äôt come out until end of December. $60+ by January.
It's a solid meme generator because involving money into anything makes people go fucking crazy, and it's a pump'n'dump.

Literally anything besides tsla mentioned is like a ticking time bomb. If you're just now hearing about it on wsb, then you're likely the mark.
Id be really happy today if NIO came out and announced that they also have a vaccine that is 95% affective

KNDI, SOLO, and FUV. Any call on these guys on monday would have made you lots of money.
before end of day. we have a strong support line at 17.20
Yeah I feel you there. I don‚Äôt try to make huge 100% plays, I like the smaller 1-2% returns that you flip quickly and having your capital tied up while a stock goes sideways fucking hurts
bout to lose her fuckin grip
Cough 2000 cough.

Excuse me
Finally...an article worth my time. this restore my faith on WSB...its been too much of gambler lately.

Thanks again OP with a yeeyee ass haircut for the DD!
The SPAC posts have been gems
Just took off

That number is reduced by 90%. In the trial, over the trial period, it was 0.44%, but that's not a property of the vaccine, it's just the rate the happened to see in their study participants over their study period.

The rate in the population at large isn't really relevant, and would depend on what time period you're looking at. The number you'd use to talk about how infectious a disease is in a population is R0, which for COVID is about 2. This means each infected person, on average, will infect 2 other people.

Since the study is done to answer questions about the vaccine, the important result is that the vaccine reduced the chance of infection by 90%.it is expected that this 90% reduction would apply, regardless of the pre-vaccine infection rate in the population.
Gyna ev is the play today

Only one letter away from NIO, sounds good to me
I understand what you mean

Right now is your once in a lifetime chance to YOLO SPY 355p 11/20.  The market bull trapped all the cucks this morning and this baby going to drill.  Sell at close for minimum üíØ% gain

You'll never get another chance to YOLO these specific puts

How do I know you may ask?  

I just finished Toobin and was informed the Ann Taylor on 3rd and both Joe & the juices around Park have closed!
Waiting for it to dip further, maybe?
I sold those on the Tuesday dip for $1.40 ....FML
Funny, I've done well with WSB's picks and the sad part is if I'd be up an additional 50-75k if I hadn't sold early (AMD, FSLY, LULU, NET, PTON, ZS).  I missed out on some *massive* gains selling covered calls on FSLY, PTON, and ZS but that's entirely on me.  The v-shaped recovery really fucked my risk tolerance.

I'm really only bagholding EURN (I actually like this one), STNG, and XLNX (finally back to break even).

I think a lot of people would do better if they didn't fuck around with options.
Why is the going down don‚Äôt make sense earnings were great

Put hyg 18 december
ZM calls lets go kids
Saw the GIK news, saw an EV company, jumped in at the high. Oof these bags are heavy.
What are your thoughts about the fact that with interest rates at all time lows and the fed promising to keep them as such til at least 2023, assets provide the best return on capital? Yes the market is overvalued but where else are institutional and retail investors supposed to park that money?
Comparing the charts AYRO gonna probably top out at $10 after taking out the highs
That's the goal.

Puts on haircuts.
A good example as to how overvalued things are is the restaurant industry. Various chain restaurant stocks like EAT and SHAK are actually HIGHER now than they were PRE-COVID! The stocks have skyrocketed in the past month despite the state imposed restrictions that continue to severely curtail their profits, and are forcing some to teeter on insolvency. These restrictions while loosened over the past 2 months, are now starting to once again become stricter as infection rates rise throughout various states.  The result is a massive opportunity to short the restaurant industry.
Oof. Sorry fam :/ 

Hope you hit

Yeah but don‚Äôt just blindly buy and yolo lol use your brain when you read these
The big short
Current production ebbs and flows with demand

Short/mid term solution is to supplement current generation with storage, and keep generation on high during low demand times to feed storage.

And you're 100% right - increased capacity is a long term need... hell, California is having brown-outs during summer, and sending text message alerts telling people to cut usage.

Poppa Elon needs to get into nuclear if he ever wants to fulfill his world domination mission

Peace be with you brother. 

Why not sell $30 CCs against the 2100 shares? That way it‚Äôs not sitting there doing nothing but going sideways?
the message is that we should keep selling TSLA puts
Lol for real

DD: when sectors boom it‚Äôs just the same money rotating, tsla -> nio -> solo -> ayro 

Better than CIIG with no options at the moment for maximum degeneracy
It just got upgraded you fucking absolute retard. It did not top. This subreddit is full of fucking morons.

Got in at 19 bebe
Yes
I sold carvana at $32 when I bought it at $8 thinking no way it could keep going up. Obviously not the same but it went up to like $90 within a few months
Wow I actually read the whole thing and even googled the things I didn't understand (Literally have never done this before). 

TLDR retard version is: the fed doesn't actually print money they just take actions to make banks feel more confident and comfortable lending out more and to encourage borrowing. Banks, however, are not lending out more and in fact appear to be preparing for an economic down turn. On top of that, there are special indicators designed to determine how over valued a market is and as of right now the market is as overvalued as it was during the internet bubble. On top of that, things like unemployment that are a better reflection of the actual economy are still soaring.

 What I mean to say is, TSLA to 600$ by end of year yachts and bitches on my dick, have fun missing out on the gains gay bear.
Because you‚Äôre a pussy

Also, since we have your attention and there are other retards watching, could you explain the intuition behind the SPAC boom?
It's got a 2T market cap. A 10% move would be 200b. It's a basically where you stick money you want to save
Just depends where they wanna close it out for OPEX. Looking at volume today I‚Äôm guessing chop around to around $357 at close tomorrow. Moon mission resumes Monday.

I thought about it when it was $25, but I definitely wouldn't get in at its current price

That would be Theta. The 11/20s are losing like $2.50/day so $.30ish/hour.

17 year old who started on Robinhood at the end of October when the market had a mini drop. Went from 10k to 5.3k up to 10.7k last Friday and back down to 10k today. Not holding anything rn, just studying patterns and waiting to buy on red days. I‚Äôd classify myself as an options swing trader. But my dumbass got a 3 month day trade ban.
One more advice for u, avoid call for YY and BEKE, especially the second one, house rental is not worthy to invest anymore in China, before Chinese New year people will go back to hometown, capital chain may break.
Also YY is not promising like huya or douyu

Good luck to all you FCEL bulls! I hope you know when to sell truly
There‚Äôs not any one metric it‚Äôs kind of subjective... I just kind of go off my gut based on what I see. Sometimes I see it once and I know it will blow up, sometimes I need to see people talk about it enough before I really believe in it. And sometimes no matter how many people talk about it I still won‚Äôt believe in it. It‚Äôs not a black and white system, no such thing exists. You shouldn‚Äôt try to derive some formula from this, just look around more that‚Äôs all.
PSTH nose dive. Speculative traders profit taking or did something fall through
If you sell CRSR you a fool
Wife asked me what I want for Christmas. Can‚Äôt think of anything besides stocks.
He‚Äôs saying big words so in my book he‚Äôs right
Eh, ZM seems to have taken on the role of the tech stock most likely to be obliterated by vaccine news, of which there is plenty more coming the next few months.

There are a few stocks often talked about I have no interest in touching, and ZM is one of them. Plenty of tendies to be made with it I'm sure, but I'd feel safer if I liquidated my entire life and put it all on Red at roulette.

Plus, I feel like a lot of what's pushed ZM up to these levels has already priced in a longer term national school-at-home scenarios which isn't the case right now.
Looks like a 20% move..... neat.... you ever try weekly options?

I remember when I had below 25k in the upper left hand corner under account info it would say how many day trades I had.
DRILL NIO
337 unfortunately. I think that one is gonna expire worthless.
Everyone's talking about PLTR...you know what that means.üìâüìâüìâ
interesting, I thought they just build software that integrates an organizations various data streams and that Palantir doesn't personally have the data.
AZN trying to break out
they have one its called communism
no storage is not the problem. the creation of energy and energy transfer across huge areas is. I just read article how if UK has to go zero oil cars in 9 years, they need to double their energy creation output by then. even if they planned 30% of by then existing cars be electric its not possible. 

now who is building new powerplants and energy transfer networks? not Germany and France who are planning to shut down their power plants instead ... noone is thinking about the infrastructure because there is no money in it
I'm your Venus I'm your fire your desire

That's the thing dude. How many times over the last fuckin year has there been "a market crash". All the fuckin cucks are waiting for it. Yah there are strong indicators, which I believe most of us know. Even the autist and retards. But the thing is, there is always a reason to go higher. 

Even now after vaccine news dissipates, there will most likely be a dip like you suggest that will bring everything to real term but that will most likely be only 10-15% at most. 

If vaccine news is positive and people can return to work retail and energy stocks will continue to rise. 

The whole reason we crashed in March was because we didn't know how the pandemic was going to effect the market. That uncertainty is what fcked us sideways. But now, going forward we know what to expect. 

Is the growth going to be slower? Yes. But because companies will still grow will result in more pump into the market. 

Just my fundamental opinion. Im not a major smartass. And yah I'm watching SpongeBob now, and jerking off to my gains
Shit man idk. People fuckin love SBUX.

The stocks that have been tanking on earnings "beats" consistently are way over extended on their forward multiples tho.

Went to check SBUX tho and nvm their multiples are kinda dumb LOL. P/S way under apples tho

Baidu planned to buy them out before this news. The fact that a company might buy out the company still for the share price of last week is keeping it up. If they announce that they‚Äôre postponing or all out cancelling the buyout then it drops to the floor hard. If they don‚Äôt then it instantly recovers to the. Buyout price

I kind of love it when there‚Äôs a legit company that actually makes money, kills on earnings reports, and their stock doesn‚Äôt go up.  It‚Äôs the clearest buy signal you can ever have. It will go up, at some point.  Holding about $12k in shares I got around $22 and short puts.
yes
Go to history and count.

Geez it‚Äôs just money
ya DFS is a solid company, but you only have one bank stock (JPM) and SYF is more a pure savings and loan play than JPM while still giving you finacial services.  I use DFS and SYF interchangably so if you already have a position in DFS keep it and keep building.
Yes

1) Make SPY look like kang gang day

I got some 250 calls expiring tomorrow. Currently up a big 5%. But Fuck it. Holding through earnings.
Ayyy atta boy!!
Another day of Market Makers trying to holdback the tsunami of gamma thats unwinding right now. Trying to dump their shares off slowly. Been doing it for weeks running out of time now that SoftBank is liquidating.

Yes gonna be great for my leaps

I think it's called sector rotation. We need some musk tweets to reverse the flow.
PTON monthlies the play? We goin on lockdown again for suuuuuure
How much more can this piece of shit market pump? We have been pushing for new ath every single day for a week without a single pullback. Where the fuck is all this new money coming from?
WTF FCEL is a 2 billion dollar company and at one point was a multi-billion dollar company. I have a feeling we are about to get a nice pump like it did in the dot com bubble. $4,000 stock ---> $5 I sense some value atleast to $6.50 thats 30% returns. Some option level goonery without having to pay the price of expiry

Reportededed for insider trading
What we are seeing right now is tesla being priced in for the inclusion. Those fat fucks can't buy all their shares at once so they need to spread it through the entire month or else they won't be able to unload and buy puts after the inclusion.  
You are fucking right about those calls. Don't get greedy and sell before the inclusion, the IV crush will be fucking unreal on this one. +50% is better than than -50% unless you're a freeloading autists who don't care about making a livelihood.

What is the root cause of the student debt problem?

  
I see that pricing argument a lot and it's so short sighted. It assumes that the government will have no control over negotiating prices with schools. It also ignores a more healthy incentive for cheaper diplomas as those schools will be pushed/advertised by the government, while expensive ivy league colleges will have to justify their pricing accordingly.  
It's also literally just a first step to address the greater problem. The goal should be that anyone can get a higher education without finacial burdens.

Good for you. I got out of JOY when they were down 27% yesterday since they would definitely rebound after a 30% drop. Didn't think they would rebound halfway but thats why you dont hold for too long after huge movements. Also about 100% gain

>I cant fucking believe you typed all that just to be wrong. There will be a dip. Never a crash. Will not happen. People freak out and say March was a crash and 08 was a crash. No. Just dips. Unless the world is ending or there are zombies, stocks always go up, the U.S. is a powerhouse for making money. Always has been. Always will be.

Less consumer spending=less liquidity is deflationary. FED actions are inflationary, it's just that deflation is strong right now. When we see more liquidity from consumer side, we will - together with quantitative easing - see real inflation in the coming years. Just like after 2009.
Looked at it yesterday and if it‚Äôs a pump and dump it‚Äôs going to be brutal.  If it was 6.5s that would have been better.  Seems like pennies in front of a steam roller

Up 100% on my gay boomers commons with CRSR... Sell half and turn in to calls time
Alot of buying and selling going on like huge amounts of trading. It might be running flat the whole day until it gets closer to end of day.
Hey man why don‚Äôt you get a bit more confidence and get locked in for a LEAP SPY 220p instead, if a crash was a crash it would fall harder than it did in March

I am in 450 11/27
facts, dont understand how they went public at only 1.8bn mcap when they have over 1.5bn in revenue, +60% revenue growth yoy and positive net income... only negative thing about crsr is that they have a bit more debt but thats it
Options cheaper than stock tho
For the love of god you idiots. Stop having paper hands and selling your PLTR. Just ride the shit to the moon. Trust me.

I just own stocks, too poor for options. Pls take your financial advice from a cripple on welfare - rumors have it IPO coming in around 6 months. I'd probably do $280 08/21C as a conservative play but I could easily see $280 and higher in a few months. 

All it is gonna take is any articles TALKING about an ANT IPO relaunch and it is gonna MOON because historically people can see it went up like mad leading up to the last IPO launch.

i cashed out @ $505 for shares and 100% for my 12/18 $500 call just couple minutes ago, i know it'll continue to run, but i'm paper handing due to potential share dilution (SP500 inclusion has known to cause companies to raise capital and dilute shares, i think google and some other big company did it) and a pull back, if it actually dips somewhat i'll buy again, it's been running for two days now, i feel like it won't be a linear run up to 600 or whatever by Dec 21. will watch with cash for now, thanks!

Why did you buy a put on FIT ? They are in the process of merging with Google. This was announced last year ([https://www.axios.com/google-fitbit-deal-pre-post-pandemic-merger-eca12d38-0b77-4ffe-8a1e-579eda9f92e5.html](https://www.axios.com/google-fitbit-deal-pre-post-pandemic-merger-eca12d38-0b77-4ffe-8a1e-579eda9f92e5.html)). Their stock prices won't fall below $6 unless the acquisition is cancelled.   

Are you betting on the acquisition getting cancelled, or are you a retard ?

even if it drops, incoming SP500 introduction will make for new highs. Sure it's overvalued, as the entire fucking market is. It's not gonna drop more than 20% now, 500 has been broken when 450 was gambling a couple of days ago.

all this focus on TSLA when NKLA is actually up more week to date
If the stock stays up for the rest of today don't the put options fall more? If it's a fraud why is it up 18%, where's that coming from? Would you get in today? Why or why not?
I have 200 shares and usually sell calls when it's over 215 and sell puts when it gets close to 200 (though it seems to floor a bit higher since last earnings, maybe 210-220 is the new range now)
Deere doesn't make money on lawnmowers dude, it's mostly manufacturing and farming which is all down the last 3 months. Plus the Midwest being hit the worse right now from Covid has also affected the market.

That's fair. It's still not a good idea to ask 'round here, I've seen dudes downvoted to hell for less. I know we have a circlejerk against that here, but perharps asking on r/investing or r/stocks related subs would be better? I advise against going to single brand themed subs, though. The tesla sub in particular is pretty delusional. (Personally, I can't help much. I started learning under the guidance of a person I know, then moved on to online classes said person suggested. But I'm still learning! Haven't made any risky plays yet because I know I'm too stupid to even do that and would only lose money.)

bruh that is literally how the market works. Big money makes their money off of little money. And trump is be the one to say "fuck it, let it crash" because he lost. Under Daddy, the markets did something no other president can do. Because of this they will support him in 2024. Take profits and come back later for cheapies

The only thing keeping TSLA from being worth more than the rest of the auto industry combined is that some money is also going to NIO shares.
Ev is popping... Look at ayro lol

You accidentally inversed yourself. Should be good.

Sold 4 $40 11/20 calls yesterday when they went down $60 like a BITCH. Mf contracts are up 375% today
Hey I'm wishing you the best. I just was done with the ride haha
ded? fslr +4% today
Interesting. Yeah, I guess that is something which I had not considered.
Wtf are those numbers I can lose way more than that in a week!!
RIP...now that it‚Äôs getting SP500 inclusion...there‚Äôs no looking back.
Fuck it, more calls !!
Reverse splits
Got in on ZM at 420.69, extremely bullish
I got in at $1 for $2500. I am looking for at least the previous high of $4 by Jan/Feb. Then I will sell and move on to the next undervalued play that has room to grow
Can any retards in here explain to me the price movement on RIDE from 10:15am until now? Is the price wall at $29 driven by algo trading unloading shares based on a pre-determined price?
$40 or 50.
Retail has always been retarded. But so has smart money this cycle, which has missed the rally by being bearish.

The reason you don't see any bears around here anymore is they all went broke playing fundamentals like OP, whose points aren't bad, but have been completely wrong since March.
I bought at IPO, and sold some covered 45cs otm for december thinking, "there's no way these get assigned"  


I'm probably getting assigned >\_>.  But I'll be up like 200% so whatever lol

Time to hit it again
Agree. WSB needs to pump it
This is looking like the old TSLA wherein Thursday to Friday were absolute face rippers. Can be hard to hold when she dips but that IV FOMO drives up hard.

answer a question for me [http://www.strawpoll.me/35148301](http://www.strawpoll.me/35148301)
OK. OK. Fair point.
600 eow?
Give her time. Lets hope for another squeeze
Tesla should split 1:5 ngl
Using Toyota is fine, but the method of comparison is the issue. Yahoo finance says Toyota current market cap is $195bn with P/E ratio of 8.59, so that backs out to earnings of $22.7bn.

Tesla current market cap is $476bn with P/E ratio of 960, so earnings of $0.5bn.

The argument you‚Äôve presented is that to grow to an equivalent market cap by 2025 they have to go from $0.5bn to ~$20bn which is where you get 40x from. However if Tesla actually grew at that pace there is no way they would be valued on a P/E of 8.59 in 2025 because the future growth from 2025-2035 will be higher than Toyotas growth from 2020-2030. I‚Äôm not sure Tesla will ever be valued on a multiple of 8.59 at any point in the next 30+ years to be honest, given the sector they operate in and the anticipated exponential growth opportunities of EV‚Äôs/battery storage/driverless vehicles. This is why I say it makes sense to focus more on just absolute earnings than the P/E ratio equivalence.

Even if we stick with the 40x multiple, Tesla could still achieve this level of earnings increase without needing to increase revenue by the same 40x amount if they instead can increase gross margins. It might be that they only need closer 35x or 30x to reach the same earnings equivalent. They‚Äôve outlined the intention to expand into software as a service with has significantly higher gross margins than traditional automotive.

Undoubtedly Tesla is already heavily priced in but there are Tesla bulls that predict $21 EPS in 2025 which would correspond to the 40x increase you desire.

Here‚Äôs a price target of $21 EPS in 2025 just from the autonomous business, it does not allow for driverless cars and/or energy storage:

Thinking about getting some longer calls
Price target for CRSR? Might have to exercise these options
The 2 most recent times Tesla issued more shares, their stock actually went up for the few days following the announcement since this strengthened Tesla's chances of having enough cash to survive for longer and gives them more money to spend on Terafactories.
Definitely needs some viagra. Unfortunately, we have a lot of limp dicks in this sub rotating in/out right now.
Why you have a hard on if we get on NIO or not? You want us to buy your decaying calls?

The more shares of TSLA you have, the less shares is available for indexers/large institutions to purchase when inclusion happens 1-2 weeks prior to Dec 21st leading to higher demands = to the moon. You only have to hold the shares to Dec 21st.

I just own a ton of shares. Not that I‚Äôm in for a long term hold, but over the next 6 months I think there will be enough news re betting and increased subscriptions that this thing can easily double or triple. Such a small market cap today, lots of room to run.

TSLA gonna close 520 easy
$1MM 401K guy lost $13K on PTON

Ouch
Do it
I have only one question before (while) I buy   500 PLTR 11/27 30$.    

What movies is this?
Prob good for a short squeeze but it‚Äôs becoming super overvalued. I‚Äôll regret not buying in a few days.
You know why if you‚Äôre honest with yourself.

I got off at 17.53 hope I didn't get out too early

Ah fuck. I never look at wsb DD, I guess I should

any CRSR calls??
Supposedly they make batteries for EVs.
Lmao I had some 11/20 TSLA calls that were bleeding me dry then the magic happened and I sold for profit, totally lucked out. My December AAPL calls, praying they turn out the same way
Nah. 1/21 7c has 20% chance of profit. Bought some yesterday already up 100%

I love Tastyworks, everytime I see SPY is "Hard to borrow" status I know we're about to run. How can these permabear dumbfuck retards possibly have any money left?
Pltr does this every time. Morning sell off for paper hands. Diamonds through lunch then sell off for profit. And repeat
Yup did so. Cus i saw his post history then saw this post
What a time to add more BABA puts !
People are taking profits
i don't know man, economy is not on a good track right now, and that directly affects mortgages, rates low or not, plus i don't see this as being sustainable in the long run, i would actually argue right now they are better than they would be, because currently low rates are fueling higher mortgage application rates, can this be kept up for them to keep growing? I will watch but won't enter at the moment, i just dont see something sustainable long-term to drive the growth.
What positions?

CRWD looking good. Meanwhile, I wish I theta-ganged AMD.
we eatin' today, boys!
Why is nobody talking about CRSR here? About 10% up every day this week :)
The only constant in options is the stinging regret no matter what move I make
What's up with solar
HCAC the next meme stock?
No lie
More than likely it'll be the day after Christmas.

That's the day benefits run out. Than rents and mortgages start coming due. Than January is when colleges payment are going to start up again.

All that combined with what will probably be a very lackluster retail market for Christmas sales?

The country is going to shit the bed. Especially if McConnell holds on as leader of the Senate and continues to stop any stimulus from happening post Trump.
Me but moved into NIU
Pics hoe
I bought a handful of PLTR 19c 11/20 when it was 18.2
Longer term options. Typically a year or more.
Need to open up that third eye mate, humans are irrational
NIO is about to not feel so good.
Pretty sure the only one coming up short is you :)
I mean if that‚Äôs a covered call that you have a $150 cost basis against that will net $3k even if exercised. Not a bad play. Plus the few hundred in premiums
Aapl has been shit the last cpl months there's better plays
Im going to go balls deep $15c Exp 12/18 god speed retard to tendie town

#PLTR waking the fuck up
Idk chief you‚Äôre trying to apply logic to a market that‚Äôs been booming despite everything going against it. We‚Äôre just in a bubble ride it till it pops
EVs are the future, buy stonk seems rational enough for me
I had not seen that, just looked it up.  Chuckled a bit
I wish I got in earlier...

i bought at 90 and sold at 120. i sensed it was too high when it was 130 and decided to sell take that profit. good luck to you.
NIO about to lose all it‚Äôs momentum... F
You will love stocktwits then
Im 1 for 6 on PUT prints, am in one now. I never learn
After people profit take pltr nio will go again. I swear people are cycling them.
Because 789
Congrats and fuck you
NVDA just announced really super strong results. Of course it‚Äôs red, duh.
yes very good argument. This is why i'm overall bearish AMZN. But hopium is rampant.
Not a loss just a missed opportunity
So PLTR contract was already in? Im not seeing much huge consistent activity
It‚Äôs being manipulated up to 18 which is the price of the new stock offering.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going anywhere
Don't tell your wife
Bought more Tesla calls
Lol idk why but this comment made me crack up
üíé hand plug 11/27 calls?
Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs enough to buy hot dog, booze and hookers from a nearby corner.
Thanks, that makes sense. You could have also answered by just saying I'm retarded.

# WHO PANIC SOLD PLTR LMFAO
Literally every ev is green. What a time to be alive.
I see EV, I am all in.
you could have had LOGI when they were in the $30-40's for over a year, coulda also had gotten into U when they IPO'd
Nothing much, what's new with you?
DKNG gonna absolutely crush me
I think it‚Äôs time to take a long BABA position
pos?
Called it. Pltr just needed time. Can‚Äôt believe yall were nervous lol
We really goin to 7 iyo?

I generally agree, but the window for this is small. First, the fed has never truly tapered, just slightly, the fed balance sheet stayed up through like 2012, and they really can‚Äôt unload anything without crashing the market. Second, the moment dollar velocity picks up, the market will moon, in real terms? No, just that $4T of money supply will hit it hard and a beer will cost $10 even in poorer parts of America. So your dates look prime, maybe even go 12/31 or first week of January for a bit more time. After that we get stimulus, then shutdown, or vice versa. And you may as well be throwing darts IMO. Also I like your $350 strike for the downside. This sounds retarded, because it is but SPY 12/31 $350p, SPY 6/30 or later $450c. The only thing that‚Äôll keep inflation down is if foreign countries buy USD like crazy and given we have been a shitshow that may not happen as it has in the past.
I made 10k in about two hours with Tesla calls. It's your sorry ass' fault for sucking Xi Jingping's weenie the poo.
11/27 105 got faked out, shoulda got 12/18 105
downvoted

Damn bro! You called FCEL when it was only up 120% for the week. Fucking genius
Mans you posted all this just so these ducks can skim over it, call you gay, and then complain that there is no quality on wsb anymore don‚Äôt give em your effort. Not worth it bro
This cuck didn't even buy at IPO, he bought in after it almost already doubled. I bought at $15, Yolo'd a whole $45 dollars. Amateur hour gains over here. Eat my 150% gains, and ability to now pay my electric bill.
Ah, good job pltr

gotcha. well I can only think to buy calls on small caps. but yea if you have a lot of stock, especially SPX, then buying puts as a hedge would be perfect. dunno exactly when and what price to buy them for. 

Also, check out DG and AES. They're the two stocks I have positions running on. I expect AES to be at $22 by 12/18 and DG to be at $224+ after earnings.

Didn‚Äôt follow. Just calling them out

Odd. I have Interactive Brokers. It‚Äôs on the Toronto stock exchange if that makes a difference for you.
I'm holding long.
Man I'm such a pussy lol.  I'm a pretty big PC gamer, and I knew ALL about CRSR when it was set to IPO.  Knew how big and popular they were in that realm.  Yet, I never bought in like a true retard, and it has over doubled in barely 2 months since their IPO.  Was such an obvious and safe bet if you knew anything about them.  Why do I continue to just sit on the sidelines with a lot of this shit...

Really unsure what to do with TSLA positions if it starts reaching towards 540 price targets if you got in before the massive pump from the S&P500 announcement. Good time to sell and re-enter from inevitable market pullback maybe?
You diving in? Currently holding one 11/27 430c but the IV is nuts
not a horrible idea
I'm looking for something to hedge against a correction that could happen any time in the next 6-8 months. Not necessarily a short term trade.

That‚Äôs right TSLA, you know how to hike!!! 90 degree inclines are shit, all about them switchbacks! keep goin bb
OP is right, there will be a squeeze and price will continue higher since SP Funds will need to rebalance and buy Tesla.  The question is who are the ones selling all these calls?  It can't be all retail.  It baffles my mind because over a billion dollars in calls were bought yesterday.
Then grief
Thank god, I think it hit its head this morning.

that being said i sold my  calls when it was 31 feelsbadman

i'm holding BigC and that shit went from  60 to 100 to 150 backto 70
You‚Äôre 100% correct on it‚Äôs not about money part. Not sure your message will reach TSLA bulls though, they only hear their calls printing money. BRRrRrRRRrrR
>Market Insider: "A Tesla rival is going public at a $5.4 billion valuation via a SPAC set up by Marvel Comics' ex-CEO"

How long we holding CIIG for boyz?

Not a big fan of them at all. Saw the Amazon of Africa name being thrown around and started doing research, it‚Äôs a piece of shit. Africa doesn‚Äôt have the infrastructure, people don‚Äôt trust online payment, burning cash at an insane list, and quite possibly faking numbers
Tsla and pltr and nio stole it's thunder
tsla = clear and blatant market manipulation, you got that part bang on...lol
yes 1/21 500
TSLA rises with the market and rises against the market.

It would make a lot sense for these SP Index and ETF's to load up on a bunch of calls and then execute them to hold the shares, to minimize the risk of the stock running to $600+ prior to 12/21.

So I found this 5 minute video about DNK on their website. I can see why someone would want to acquire it after Americans didn't want to buy this stock because it was a Chinese Company.

Dkng $41 monday and now $50 and no one talking about it
Got scared, sold everything and put it in tesla shares


I'm just here for confirmation bias now
Or, this news is all just true.
I‚Äôm going to be honest with you. I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. I use the active trader pro platform. The active trader desk, which is a team in the fidelity call center that specifically works with clients on that platform, doesn‚Äôt open until maybe 8:30 AM. So before then you will get a normal stock trader that isn‚Äôt specifically an active trader. Both of those teams literally sit right next to each other. So a normal trader still knows very, very well what ATP is and how it works. The managers and help desk associates are all former ATP reps. And they all use ATP too. ATP is a platform that is owned and operated entirely by Fidelity. So there‚Äôs about a 0% chance a rep AND a manager told you they didn‚Äôt support or know how ATP worked. 

And either way. A trade dispute is a trade dispute. Even if you got a normal trader and didn‚Äôt get to the ATP desk, you still can initiate one.
CRSRs volume way above average today - anyone got any insight into what that generally means when it's not based on any news?
With the amount of hype that surrounds it no one will care about the bad news until either next week or a few days before it actually joins the S&P
I didn‚Äôt short TSLA but man is that stock doomed in the next year. If it didn‚Äôt split that shit would currently be +2,500per share. The psychology of the split is truly incredible.
How can CRSR be legally green every single day
A lot of investors that missed the IPO myself included don‚Äôt want to get in before the lockout expires so we can see what the stock price looks like after employees sell out
It‚Äôs not TSLA

msft bounces between 200 and 220 since like forever... every few weeks the limits might move up a bit but its pretty predictable
TSLA really gonna hit 600 by end of Nov huh
Buy calls for mid 2021.. more time to expiry kind of slows things down
Once NIO pushes past 48 its going up to embrace 50 like an old friend

I do and will do more. But there‚Äôs no reason I can‚Äôt enjoy trading ... it‚Äôs fun for mex

There is literally nowhere else to invest if you want more than negative real returns on your money. Yet the market is going to tank in 2-3 months max?

Yeah CNBC has done a lot of shit like that before. But anyone that trades on their ‚Äúnews‚Äù is a boomer moron about to get fucked
Same here!
If you think it‚Äôll go up further, go in and put in a trailing stop-loss.
The Reverse Split earlier this year really did some damage to this stock. Pre RS would be in the .70c area currently, which would have been during peak Corona times.

I'm about to write a DD post on DLTR so I can leave someone else to hold these bags
It got a shout out on CNN a couple weeks back. I also think people are annoyed they missed out on AMD and NVDA and saw a relatively cheaply price hardware stock to jump into. Then it‚Äôs kinda snowballed. 

That‚Äôs my analysis, could be completely wrong.

Why is pton such a bitch nowadays, I thought Becky was unstoppable

Cant read for shit when do u think it‚Äôll crash?
Yep rolled my 17.5 calls for Friday into 12/11 20C there‚Äôs gonna be a big run up pretty soon
That‚Äôs what I got. I feel like SOLO is just being pumped too.. but now I feel like I‚Äôm just sitting here watching it continue to take off and I‚Äôm on the wrong side of the trade. Idk. We‚Äôll see
21st century capitalist western civilization is a complete dystopic existence, change my mind

Great DD
NEXT LEG UP on TSLA coming up
Soon
Someone instruct me how to douglas
Clarity isn't required on the antitrust regulation. The draft is actually fairly concise and mostly revolves around merchant exclusivity agreements and predatory pricing.

Predatory pricing is a non-issue for BABA now but they did partake in the past when pushing AMZN out of the Chinese market.

Merchant exclusivity is the main one that would affect how things are currently done. Both JD and BABA have extensive lists of exclusive merchant partners but it remains to be seen eliminating this would have a material effect on the business - it seems unlikely.

IMO the real issue is the FUD around the party targeting Ant/Ma/BABA in particular.

Some of that is true but has also been true the last 10+ years, CCP and BABA have had a love hate relationship for a long time and small disagreements like this aren't new.

Ant IPO suspension was called for. There a number of reasons for this, namely passing of new draft legislation that would significantly reign in asset backed lending. If the IPO had proceeded then the legislation landed then public investors would take the hit and it would delegitimize the new capital markets CCP is trying to establish.
Also unregulated fintech of the size of Ant group is a dangerous thing, they are right to put the screws into it even if it adversely affects BABA shareholders (I'm long BABA).

So basically it just boils down to sentiment and fear selling. Price will probably return to normal in a few months, legislation will land to little or no fanfare next year and we won't even remember that is what caused the massive sell-off.
Stop chasing YOLOs, FDs, and MEME stocks.  

Aim for 1-3% a day and do your own DD and only make one or two plays at a time.

Most of the posts here are college kids playing with their birthday money anyway. 

Suggest buying 100 shares of a company you like and sell CC for a bit until you build up confidence again and are ready to jump in.

Great info. May the chips fall where they may. I went mostly cash tuesday. Rona caught me to many times. Holding spy puts and vxx calls. Let's rock n roll.
I love how most of y‚Äôall are so thirsty for DD but y‚Äôall shit on every post no matter how good or bad it is lmao. No wonder everyone who used to post is gone y‚Äôall are too fucking retarded to appreciate anything
Imagine not owning any- this is the most sure way to make money and some are still skeptical
I have no idea, I‚Äôm not even approved for options because I don‚Äôt want the temptation lol. I haven‚Äôt sold a call or put against my shares, but that could be a smart thing to do for this year since it‚Äôs pushing me into such a high tax bracket.
Literally arrived to the same conclusion. PDT is abysmal. Sticking to WeBull for fun plays. Might even open an IRS with them too.

The markets have recovered and faang is near all-time highs. There isn't going to be any big movements anymore on SPY. Look at what happened to NVDA, still massively up since March, beat again yesterday, but down only 1.34%. We need to find new companies to make money off of
Rumor is Berkshire Hathaway is building positions in TSLA rn..
Just keeps going up. Was waiting for something lower too.

Buy calls
Buying calls on one of the businesses deemed essential in a pandemic, proved they can still make a profit it 2020 and its one of the places older older people 30+ spend their time and money.

I know it‚Äôs not an EV stock (I own those too) but I can tell you they are a solid business. It may not moon but it‚Äôs going to go up. That‚Äôs my opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own.

Bought calls on NIU. one of the few EV stocks that hasn't been pumped to the moon yet. They're a chinese company that makes electric scooters and according to my friend who lives in china everyone is switching to them.

It‚Äôs risky but this happens with every spac, DPHC (RIDE now) went up to over 30 before merging. Arrival has strong prospects and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if it broke 30 within a month or two based on hype alone. It could have a sell off soon but that‚Äôs a tiny blip in the long run. I think if you make 100% sell half and hold on to the rest for the long run

Forget the pump and just dump this shit. You fuckers have been trying to pump this shit stock for so long
Unsure if joking or not, but this really has looked like a thing this year.

EV stocks, now PLTR, DKNG -- whatever's the hot topic seems to get a lot of buying power.

I mean they each have merits to buy up in the long run but the people putting money in has to be thinking 'ope, the idiots from WSB are piling into here best get in too while it's the flavor of the week'.
I‚Äôm just gonna hold, next week expiration. At this point
You can make money off wsb, just interpret the posts correctly.

Alibaba is suffering from anti monopoly law in China, but bilibili is still fast growing, no advertising plus alot of great content creator, even YouTube in China can't compete bilibili, many official company and government departments created their accounts on bilibili this year, much better than IQ
I thought there was more news like the apple news or something, oh well let‚Äôs go!
c'mon CLSK.  Make me pick a winner for once.

If you're new and don't buy puts on BCLI then you literally hate money.
Enjoy, my brother
Sell your shit homie!
I bought it back then but got bored of the 0 movement.

CIIC dip instantly covered in 10seconds. Gonna moon
Puts on your shit grammar
I like his vest tho
Lol, I sold my $TSLA calls and bought puts AMA
About a month ago someone posted a long DD on CRSR and at the time it was trading at $18. Most of the comments on the post were shitting on the guy.
Goddamit PLTR fucking do something
[deleted]
Stay at home stocks are back!
r/algotrading 
That shit goes over my head but hey options did too at first. I assume it would take time to work but its just preset levels to buy and sell. Like coded stop losses to sell immediately as an indicator changes/price drops .25% whatever
I made a lot on Tesla puts during the March crash. And then I lost it all on more Tesla puts afterwards lmao. The lesson has been learned
CRSR 42 EOD
Just go a month out and I swear you‚Äôll be better off
r/smallstreetbets
Tesla, the future, the innovative, the human, the money safe haven. Aint even mad
lol same but good thing is its still new u will definitely make money. Just need to wait a bit at least with ciic anyways.
Instantly bought back up
easy money, say less

and this right here is why I hate bears. "Market is gonna CRASH. Well, no I don't have any short positions, it's going to crash anywhere in the next 2-24 months, but when it crashes it's gonna CRASH. I mean yea I'm 30k deep in OTM NIO calls but EVs can't miss and they will be CRASH proof."
If you‚Äôre profitable. Sell and roll it out to farther expiration higher strike.
It's going to take a while for their ships to get back to work.

stock price above $500 still. oh right, it's not a car company.
DIE SPY, DIE!
Fuck as someone who bought $2k in equity last week, selling my position now
Why is no one talking about this insane kndi run?...I want to shoot my self for only buying 200 shares
As far as I Know they are the only Chinese Ev with permission to sell to the US and just the other day, Texas approved rebates for their vehicles. I think out of all the meme evs this one actually has a real chance at growth besides pump and dump.
My own are in my hands too. I am up $10k on it since I spammed it earlier this week on WSB and got shadowbanned
Broke out of channel from last few days. Up 7% already
Pltr bear trap. Watch what comes next.
whenever you sell a stock you realize gains or loss and it has a tax impact.
You live a dangerous life. A true WSB autist
After I should have cashed out pltr calls yesterday, I don‚Äôt want to make the same mistake twice. But crsr has be mooning every single fucking day
Tesla just hit ATH
Wtf was that CIIC drop
AAPL and MSFT are post-menopausal grammies
Highly depedent on the next few months. The company has a lot of debt, and just did a dillution. They are still looking for funding even though they have been around for a while. 

It could easily hit $20 by mid next year, but also I think it's starting to get pumped heavily. Especially now with more and more posts on here about it. Best advice is be cautious. This is a really easy one to day trade options on right now
selling algo turned all the way up on ciic :(

As long as we continue holding $500, our next stop is $511
Tsla needs to blow through the ath and then it won't stop.
LOL at that chart interpretation, just going to completely ignore the breakout between 2nd and 3rd "rejections"?
You think people in here know how to play theta?
Did you guys notice market manipulation on TSLA by CNBC?

I am convinced CNBC is working together with MMs and shorts. 

TSLA shot up again and they are trying to crush it with the news like "Consumer Reports no longer recommends TSLA model 3 due to reliability concerns"

Blatant attempt to save their shorts.
that DOW pump and dump wasn't artificial at all...
Probably tomorrow

U.S. is months away from civil war, the entire world is locking down again. A great depression is coming and yet you have a bunch of degenerates throwing money at TSLA 800 and NIO 100 calls. What a time to be alive.

Well made a decent bit of money off TSLA and PLTR but it looks like CRSR and TWLO were the moves at open
 üö® TESLA ABOUT TO BREAK ATH !!! üö®
PLUG still feel like they need to have a better long term plan.

PLTR looks to have huge investments for long term so it may be more viable after this current rally. 

CRSR may drop soon due to people wanting to take profits, however still would be likely to keep growing. (As gaming is never really gonna get smaller.)

That‚Äôs my hot take atm but it‚Äôs always worth doing your homework
I love when you watch an option price increase 100% in 30 mins from open but you just watch it increase instead of buying. 

Made to many bad decisions this last couple weeks so nervous to jump in. Fuck me
I have a very bright outlook for all clean energy tickers, mainly due to the change in presidency in the United States

Whats the next market moving news fellas? I‚Äôm going with aliens for 5000. We need some friendly alien news to pump this market!
You missed the biggest argument. When I buy any stock - it usually dips. Since I just started investing just 3 months ago, it makes total sense for the market to crash and my money go ‚Äòpoof‚Äô.
a nice 30% day going all in on 1 dte amzn calls
694.20 is the new 420.69
Don't get shaken out of üçâ. This is only going to keep going up. No matter the price, index funds are going to need to buy for the Spy rebalancing as early as Dec.14th if it's in two tranches since the market cap is so big. The smart buyers are holding to drive share price up. The idiots that don't know what's going on are selling for small gains or those that bought in at the previous top and are short sighted. Hold and watch this keep going up as there are less and less shares to go around.

With the stupid trades I've made today I deserve to lose money
BABA up an entire percent, prayers have been answered
Unemployment rate isn‚Äôt sky high. It‚Äôs at 6.9% as of September, and probably around 5-6.5% as of today. This is higher than 2019 levels, but lower than 2013 levels.

Another factor that you missed is the shift from small-business to big business during the crisis. Stocks by definition represent only the larger businesses, so part of the valuation relative to gdp has to do with a shift within the economy that‚Äôs not captured by raw growth/decline. In other words, big business can organically grow while the economy declines because the losses are mostly felt by smaller businesses.
For Tesla TSLA we are going to reach Morgan Stanley target price of $540 soon, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when we're going to reach it.
Ive said it many times but i dont know how stupid people can be here. 

BABA tanked because of the antitrust uncertainty. 

It will not go back up before there is antitrust clarity (and news are not bad). 

For fuck sake, get this into your tiny retarded skulls.

PTON didn't drop because of vaccine news though.... if you read a bit, they are having extreme issues with available inventory. They don't count orders as revenue, only after the order has been delivered. they are backordered by months at this point and they are also in 2 lawsuits right now. I really really wish you didn't do PTON man. There's a reason it went from $130 > $100. I do wish you good luck but it's not gonna move much in a few days. You should've just stayed with CRSR. Currently another +10% day.
Yep, you're right. I just love FDs. Gonna try to turn a new leaf.
prob untill mid dec. they cant fk up the xmas season it would fk up the whole quarter
I mean as far as I'm concerned no matter what silly analytics u use there is no way to actually predict anything, so why give advice? U know as much as anyone would wether they have been trading for decades or two days.
Easiest play in any market is common sense and knowing the risks and not these dumb ass drawings on charts.
I may be retardet but not retardet enough to believe u   (or anyone for that matter) can calculate the market.

I am a freeform retard 
I trade without knowing anything and realistically I have the same chances of making bank as you.
Lock gains and get marked?
Go look again and tell me im wrong

You're way too late. I've been playing it for months, it's way overextended. Any large market pullback (especially rotation out of tech) is gonna tank it to $30 again.

Sold 11/20 $25p, for the record, couple months ago.
I sniff your mother ass

If you make profit on this, take your winnings and move the fuck on...before the merger happens.  SPACs are frought with all sorts of weird shit and risks that your average retail cuck has no idea about. They can be extremely complicated. Don't bag hold like an idiot for the merger.  Take your wins and move on quickly.  SPACs have been torching people recently with a lot of dogshit blowing peoples' accounts up.  Rinse and repeat of the SPAC craze and implosion of the 00s.
I just have 500 shares at a $3.80 basis, wish I added more when it was down in the 2‚Äôs

Imagine being bearish on TSLA
Thinking about 260c for baba in Jan. What strikes are some of you guys buying?
He‚Äôs just mad cuz he can‚Äôt afford FD‚Äôs
Goodluck mate. I got out at 420 with a decent profit. I got scared when it dropped hard to the 408s. Can't let it slip like that again. Too volatile.
Anyone buying Baba calls?
Yes
I listened, thanks!! <3
Market drops.  NIO raises.  Makes sense.
I honestly don‚Äôt mind being limited by PDT on robinhood. Whenever I have the chance to trade I lose money. Whenever I‚Äôm forced to hold I make money. Trading is just fun but it‚Äôs not worth it if you can just hold and watch money slowly trickle in.
Favourite meme on wsb and there‚Äôs been great ones.

Ever since it‚Äôs big initial drop it has fucked me over and over again trying to time it coming back up.  It just sits there taunting me
One thing I‚Äôve learned from WSB: Ride the wave. don‚Äôt stay attached to meme stocks and get ready to switch to the next rocket

TSLA is a scam. It sucks all the money from the rest of the market. When TSLA goes up you know market is dumping
I just earned 800$ in a hour, paperhands selling XD

TSLA 1000c 11/20
PS on the options side, I sold my TSLA call this morning at 498 and am jealous of those who had the balls to hold
ZM!!!!!
When you already came but she just keeps SUCKING. CRSR I can‚Äôt take it anymoree
Cashed out of NIO, cash gang until tomorrow
Definitely, it‚Äôs been added to my list!  Thanks for the DD!
So, how much % of your portfolio is in your December puts?
Let me know, I'm sitting on 20k cash also.
What do you mean? I looked up the real prices in march in Thinkorswim. 

Today they are worth this much, including all the time and volatility etc, thats the price for these options.
nio 50c exp 1/2021
That‚Äôs a little bit of my reasoning but there are many other factors.
TSLA ready for liftoff
bro, CIIC is not shit lol do ur dd before u spit
Just need the media to start hyping the coins again
Baba call
What does diamond hands mean? Not selling?
If the valuation is $5.2B why is CIIC market cap less than $1B on RH?
Oy vey look at that drill
This shit is crazy!
You show me a positive All Time graph I quit my job right now and work for you
If the TSLA RSI dips sub 30 I'm going all in
Yeah bro it aint gonna stop
I know we don‚Äôt talk shares here, but if we were, what would you grab right now for a long term hold - PLTR, CRSR, or PLUG?
Went with ciic
Guilty as charged.
tesla... whatre you doing....
Tesla FD
Sneaky volume on CLSK
And you fuckers laughed at me when I said I was buying SPY puts at 362
Out of WDAY for now, will probably moon, maybe reload on a dip
wmt just gonna fade all day again pissin me off
the one you push w your legs, maybe
History always rhymes & even us ret@rds know that market dips give way to crazy fucking rallies. All of us morons that doubled down in March made our yearly salaries in 4 months. No asshole that‚Äôs not in retirement using their 401k to buy Viagra for their wrinkly cock wants to be the pea brain that sells at the bottom & then has to chase the market. I don‚Äôt wanna be that guy but this time it‚Äôs different. More & more Autists realize that stocks go up in the long run. It‚Äôs like the biggest degenerate pyramid scheme of all time, so big that you‚Äôre a dickhead if you sit on the sidelines. The fed will be buying ETFs in 10 years or less mark my words ret@rds!
the CRSR fomo is real. Tb to when i had 200 shares at 20
will my tsla puts going to devastate my portofolio?
How is this DD?
Wish I would have bought more of those instead of CCL puts üêªüåà

Even with zero logic PFE should go up. GME went up on news of using Microsoft Teams and selling out a brand new console like every other retailer. I‚Äôm fine with stupid shit like TSLA continuously going up but this is just mega retarded to me.
YES! and loving it. Only small potato money in it but im up 240$. Mine expire next Feb so Im wondering when to drop out. Once the Vaccine first batch news comes out they will soar.

i really hate how anything can be pinned to the frontpage here. it's abuse of mods and clearly a pump and dump. stay away from any shill that's pinned. its a pure P&D
plz say it is so!
well, do you know how options work? if you bought a long dated spy put at 9:55 and sold at 10:25 you would have made money. obviously less the more long dated.

Timing a put on the SPY is much harder than ZM or DOCU imo. You need to worry about how stable SPY really is. when you buy a put, thats it, but when a hedge fund do so, they are constantly delta hedging ...
Can you sell some puts to manage your short term tax liability? I would definetly seek advice about taking into account past losses or spreading it across years...
Bro its nuts. I sold my calls yesterday confident that it was faltering and wouldn't get past the mid 15s. I even checked this morning and saw it go up and then down and was confident it was going to go sideways or bleed today. Then this shit happens. 

I would have been up 2k if I had held. Fuck me.

As they said in the Corps ‚Äúcomplacency kills‚Äù, this has dragged on for months and people are becoming complacent (myself included). Now going out with groups of people, house parties.. etc. Example, a person gets tested two days after potential exposure, gets negative test and then chills with people. Well the incubation period is longer than two days, that person who thought they were neg, now infects others, then it multiplies.
Thanks, anon.

At least until you buy.
Ok gay bears just give up and let tsla run up
Yeah but such a risky play. By the numbers it shouldn't be going down so your short position would be entirely sentiment based. 

Which is great if you can time it but without an objective measure it's not a repeatable strategy.
TSLA got to do 530 today.

It's not going to happen. You're right though, if it did, the govt would have to stop offering govt-backed loans in order for the tuition prices to drop afterwards. Like how it was in the 60s before the govt offered backed loans.

Why? Unless you're planning to retire soon. After every crash the market attains new highs within a few years. Hold positions in companies you believe in and broad etfs and when the market crashes pile your cash holdings into the same. I know my post here is r/investing shit but for the 99% this is absolutely true. I am building my cash holdings hoping for a crash while I still trickle money into stocks knowing I'm too retarded to time the market.

at the end of the day, day traders really don't know whats going on because they don't have every data point at hand. at best you can make  a picture and go with it, a lot of it is experience mang. Just realize which plays are losing, cut them, then manage your bankroll to risk. thats probably the biggest part of trading, is when you enter a play with confidence, realize the risk and manage it. im high af, my stocks are going as planned and im just waiting. but if im wrong, I dont care beacus the money i put in won't dent my overall profit, even if i lost it all.

But then you might miss out when it hits 600 EOW

**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

One of main requirements to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

FCEL moon mission again
Did they ban Red days again???

What is this shit, give me a fucking dump!
It‚Äôs going plaid
Is PLTR Good scared to look
Usually theres a strange selloff pattern to most stocks when it reaches a round number, so at 39ish (before 40) it just might collapse.
I‚Äôm scared
I want to believe you
Damn CRSR doubled my money just on IPO shares

Tesla is like a big game of chicken , don't be the last to take profits üí∞üòú
TSLA just announced 8,000 mile range üò±
PIC GOING BUCK WILD!
Hello  üìû CIIC GANG  üìû REPORTING
PLTR is a money printer
I stare at my NIO +700%.. I won‚Äôt sell, I want more, I said I‚Äôd sell at 40 but, I want more.
Could someone please remind AMZN they are the biggest corporation in the world? I think it caught autism
Just a matter of time. Merger in 2021 ü§ûüèº
Since so much money has been made this year on rally from March lows, what are the chances of a tax fueled sell off eoy similar to the one a couple years ago
you think it‚Äôs gonna hit $6?
I wish they had weeklies
When's the exp?
Till at least March. What about you?
NOTHINGGGG
If it shoots to 520 I swear I‚Äôll take profit and rest for the week
[deleted]
Lol a slight pull back after a huge run is not crashing.
stocktwits user: ‚Äúhmm yes day traded DKNG 49.70 to 49.81 always good to take profits‚Äù
What's the point of something even being on Robinhood if you can't buy options on it?
Way way up
If DKNG actually hits 60 next week I will be swimming in my own nut for days
Never sell
u goochie
Damn dude. You must be losing money
Leettzz go boiizz
Where‚Äôs butt PLUG hang at?? üöÄüî•üöÄ
So lets say CRSR goes up 10%, my option only goes up about 15% or so. If the delta is 1 and CRSR goes up 10%, the option will also go up 10%.
I feel like FCEL is being pumped... thinking about Dec Puts on FCEL
I dumped 10,000 into 12/31 AMD 83C...

CHANCE ME
HCAC could be back on the cards soon and hasn‚Äôt moved yet. Get it before the hype. One bit of news away for a big up day.
I think there is a dump at some point for us in the near future, but not an insane dump.  There is an unprecedented amount of money flowing into the economy/market.  Inflation will come for goods and services, but I think the stock market is ahead of the game in that regards.  Stocks are experiencing inflation first
yeah my today chart is fine but 1 week and 1 month are way off idk what the deal is
Pass
Fuck off with your pump and dumps
Where would be a good place to pick up plays like this early?
[deleted]
Fucking boomers are keeping it afloat dreaming of going on cruises as soon as they get a vax shot
TSLA just taking a little break before it shoots up to $520
Important to remember that many companies are not publicly listed and the stock performance of a company is not well correlated to the financial well-being of it‚Äôs employees
Lol
Nio gives me anxiety
not only that but 95% of us will make more money than you. The best saying is "bears do all the work but make the least amount of money" the market is essentially bullish till proven bearish.
Nothing can stop CRSR
Check out the Jan ‚Äò23 calls lol they looks like a steal

Too bad for you i choose to read one sentence and it was this one, normaly i only look at pictures.
TSLA consolidating every 10 minutes to allow the next batch of FOMOers an opportunity to buy-in. Gotta love it
Corsair made bank for those that bought on Monday, jesus christ.
Literally PLTR,CIIG, and TSLA. Take your pick.
You have to be retarded to short Tesla after it essentially traded flat for 3 months and there's multiple recent catalysts to make the stock go higher.
Market only go up
operation v-shape on SPY was a complete failure
NIO‚Äôs back!  Get those 50c
You have ruined me. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs good enough for a screenshot, it‚Äôs good enough to sell.‚Äù So now I don‚Äôt want to screenshot anything.

Tsla $480c 12/18
Welcome home
BABA's stock price will be the deciding factor for if my children get IPads or coloring books for Xmas your call Yong...
Looks like it‚Äôs consolidating above the broken trend line for another move up = bullish. On top of $80 billion a month in bullshit being bought by the fed were not slowing down for years. Wait for stimulus announcement and we‚Äôre at 400 watch
It's a WSB rite of passage at this point
LET'S FUCKING GOOOO

NOthing wrong about taking profits. Take some off the table and leave the rest.
What‚Äôs next for Tesla at this point? Is this legal?

Someone conducted a survey on that awhile back (2.4k people responded, I believe) the average age was 24-25.
Guys I did it! I finally fucking did it! 

I bought one share of NIO.
[removed]
Yeah if you‚Äôve got that kind of capital you can play those swings and make good %s
What? I‚Äôm confused. If the delta is .9 how do you mean you‚Äôre barely making anything? You‚Äôre so far ITM that every time it moves your premium goes up a dollar? That‚Äôs a lot...
All hype atm, their small flat beds cost 22k. Even with the merger of club car, its not going to keep them afloat
[deleted]
Alright TSLA.  Where are you going now?  Make a move.
anyone else's rh graph fucked up..
You say that like the stock hasn't doubled in two weeks.

Damn straight, should have listened to that dude on 11/9 who said its gonna jump $5 a week. Its growth is STRONG

I can tell this reasoning is flawed, but can't explain why - Thus I agree with you.
Deutsche Bank has target at $50, Bank of America has target at $54.70, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre much smarter than the analysts that work there, and have done much deeper research in to NIO financials than they have. I‚Äôm selling now based on your analysis.
DKNG breaking $50 soon!
guess real estate stocks are not booming as the market because people is too busy selling their 2nd residence and houses to cover their loses during COVID

so sales above forecast do not equal good stonks.
Here comes DOCU oh what a surprise. I can make millions on that one alone if I wasn‚Äôt such a p
Is TSLA gonna break 510 today? Should I sell my 11/26 calls for a massive gain?
SPY wants to tank so bad but the retard strength holding it up

Your faith in papa Elon wavered, heretic.
I probably gotta sell it. Even a slight dip tomorrow would really crush my profits. It could easily run another 5% tomorrow, but I don't want the risk
I'm FOMOing hard into TSLA and NIO rn
My memory doesn‚Äôt go back that far. It makes me a titan in this game

Hope you ended up buying yesterday :D got a nice double bagger
It‚Äôs broken 48, 50 is easy now
I'll be selling my car to get back into puts if mine expire. I'm ready to put everything on the line. Tesla is flying too close to the sun.
Hold on to 11/27 $505c or sell?
I start getting really nervous every time NIO shoots up now
get in on LRN while you can
CRSR calls are lovely

Yea. I just bought those calls for a quick flip on the oversold region when it was fading hard after S&P news. I didn‚Äôt expect it to fade and then skyrocket like that. Holy shit. I also don‚Äôt want to hold and gamble for too long because I am down 3500 overall and don‚Äôt to lose even more because I slowly gain it back. If I was playing with house money I would‚Äôve just held.
Today bois...we moon
Do we buy TSLA calls for the FOMO of other r buy puts knowing there will be a flip AHHHHH

Just bought some NIO at 48

Sell you fool
Take profit if that close brother. A red day tomorrow and you have no option to wait for a recovery. Better to take it while ahead even if you miss out on a few dollars tomorrow.
520 for sure today
The flaw in this reasoning is you are treating the entire market as a game to the rich to use to punish. The reality is they don't give a shit about trump they care about being and staying rich. Maybe there is some cabal of coordination but I don't think the rich change the game based on politics.

This is classic SQ
sold at $23 and man do i feel like shit
Word is 88% of the consoles they sold were the disc based version. Your story sounds like bullshit, there's no way they were filling $400 orders with a $500 product that is sold out everywhere.

Not dump but I‚Äôll be surprised if it bumps far above 50
If you're young, ***ask yourself one thing***:

Would you be more angry if you (1) lost your savings, or (2) missed out on being an overnight millionaire because you were too pussy to hit the BUY button on that sweet sweet weekly call.

Imagine never having to work again, fucking a different hot bitch every single night

PLTR EOW predictions?
God. What a shit stock pltr
[deleted]
It's gonna break past 50 then end on 48-49
That's why you sell before the options before the earnings so you don't get crushed. Yeah keeping them can make you a shitload of tendies, but it can also erase your account. Greasy fingers loose the tendies.
Confirmed
Tesla looks like she's losing steam
People losing their minds cause Tesla up 3.5%
Apple making a nice little flag
No because those shares have a set strike price so the person selling the call would sell it to the buyer at that rate.

You also need the capital to excerise so only big players excerise.

Most people are just chicken sitting on the option keeping it warm and assuming the risk and then selling before hatch to someone better equipped to handle the live chick (shares)

Most of the run up happens before hand if sellers see movement and try to cover prior to assignment.
The study was conducted in April, with a lower volume of cases... with self reported results.

Get in on PLTR now
time to bail, friend
RIP Tesla.
TSLA has been a daytrader‚Äôs wet dream this week
What‚Äôs next 510 then 520?
Sell calls on $U if you like theta

Imagine not being in CRSR
Id like to see 17.90ish. It would be a nice point to reload
make your own decisions
Get out today don‚Äôt hold theta will eat you
> because nobody who trades know what they're doing.

Serious question: Does that ever change and you become a wizard, or does really nobody has any idea past educated/informed guess and risk management?

I keep piling on the books I read and making slim earning from prudent swing trading but I wonder if i'll ever get a hold of it or if it will forever be careful gambling more than calculated risk (dunno if the difference is as obvious to others as it is to me).
ZM. Keep trying baby you piece of shit

So when does the PLTR pump start?
Depends on your exp date and if you think it‚Äôs overvalued currently.  Personally I think the company will continue to grow as they get more stores but they could take a hit in the short term.  If you have a short-dated put it might be best to sell and recover what you can
Oh mooning = $6/12pct below where it was less than one week ago! what a moon!!

It either hits big or you lose your bet, treating them like options is really hard since it swings so wildly
I should have gone NIO over ZM but hey I guess tesla will just carry for now

Isnt this incorrect as the contracts you would have bought then would have high ass premiums with the VIX spike? They would not be worth this much

I don't think i can even buy premarket. Never tried, just don't think it's possible. So I got in around 17.20 I believe. My broker was being gay so that caused a delay.
NIO is gonna hit 50 again the same day TSLA breaks 500, its poetic
Can PLTR wake up now?
NIO heard Andrew Left was talking shit. He‚Äôs just a little hard of hearing, took him a while to realise. That‚Äôs all
PLTR is trash today
I'm getting beat up over here. I hope so.
Fuck I thought that CRSR shit people were spamming was CRSP. Long live Corsair.
Knew I should‚Äôve inversed that PLTR call
Pltr long
lmao
First of all this is hilarious. 

Second of all, did I see the made up word "upmost" in here? What is it with people going through life without having the slightest fucking clue about what's going on? How fucking brain dead do you have to be to think the word 'upmost' exists? In between molesting you, your relatives never bought you a book or let you read a newspaper they bought? Any credibility you ever have in life will be immediately wiped out by how retarded you make yourselves appear in writing. I can't imagine what your resumes look like, holy shit.

I cant believe I sold my feb. CRSR call for only $200 profit. I knew it had it in it, but I've been burned so much before. I could have made up all my losses if I wasn't so paper handed.
Got scared and sold my CRSR 40c....FML
Oh yeah definitely holding. This disparity is gonna be pennies in a month
Didn‚Äôt read

Damn Corsair I SEE YOU üëÅüëÑüëÅ
SOLO GANG RISE UP
Same, worried im not going long enough tho..
**How much $15,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 11/20/20 $300** strike calls was **1.51**. Lets say we used $15k to buy 100 contracts to hold until expiration.

Today SPY 11/20 $300 calls are at the price of 55.70 which gives us a total value of:

#$557,000

no TA, no DD, no need to monitor Elon twitter, just blindly invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement. All you need is luck and perfect timing. üåàüöÄ
Cause chase is selling you their options. They got the insider trading options going
All I see is a big W shaped recovery like the analysts said in March
Analysts never wrong 
Stonks only go up
It‚Äôs all priced in

üåàüêª is fuk
Ciic is the new Nio fuck it
Wish I bought more calls :( got in when it was trading at 16 for 22.5c 01/15

It's a boomer stock, but my favourite boomer stock. I have some shares.
CRSR isn't even a tech company. they sell peripherals and some PC components, and have a lot of competition. is there even a moat?

for what reason is it up 8% today? more lockdowns mean people are going to buy computers.. the same computers they would have bought 8 months ago for the first lockdown?
$10k after $10k adds up pretty fast.
While y‚Äôall on Tesla. Nio about to break 48

I sold my shares yesterday, don't regret a thing
I dunno.  Fighting retard strength is tough.
Yo when should i sell my option my shit is going up and i scared
Keep saying CRSR will have a red day, but at this point I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to happen
I've bought every top and sold every bottom. EVERY...SINGLE... ONE ü§°

Well I had and PLTR...

but also NI0 üëå
I bought shares at 124$ like a boomer fuck a couple months ago and just want to exit the position to free up buying power
I bought SOLO and FCEL puts and now I‚Äôm sweating
Cummins announced they are going to hydrogen and ditching diesel. Thats the reason for the run up. 

It's not being talked about because no one in WSB does DD anymore.
also why there so many variations, theres CIIUC, CIICW and CIICU do yk if they're all linked? they seem to be, might get in CIICW its cheap
You‚Äôre a retard then. Should have held till 200 next year. I‚Äôll see you then to rub it in because I already know 100% where this company is going
So glad I got out of PLTR and got back to NIO, got destroyed by PLTR IV in the last 3 days
Damn I missed the Tesla 500 break by 5 minutes

PLTR wtf why are you going the wrong way

With the fed rates at zero for the next couple years they have a lot of room to grow
master roku is bending air like a motherfucker
I was looking at $15.80 on my screen for 20 minutes thinking I should buy pre-market. I‚Äôd be up 10% rn instead of down 1%. Guess it won‚Äôt matter in the long run though
fuck you PLTR do something

This is how its supposed to work. 

Too strong to crash for puts but too smart to reward retarded FOMO plays of those that decided to yolo on weekly calls waiting another 20% after a 20% run up. These behaviours shouldnt be rewarded.

Because he can afford to not give a shit what people like you think about his looks
If it's just 20% we'd be mostly OK. Just average out your loss by buying more.

Bought alibaba at 270, and i keep buying till my Avg Price per Unit is 254. And if it tanks further i will buy further... Now if it were to tank 50% from my current position i couldnt double the amount i put in to average that though.

You weren't with me and most others, you bought wayyyyyy sooner

There are a lot of people sitting on some extra cash just now hearing the market is going up (omg ATH!), new shitcoin highs etc.

And since houses are too expensive for an investment right now and interest is 0 they invest in the US market.

I am Dutch, lot of ppl started lately. And nobody really gives a fek about the AEX. Look at the slower increase of EU markets. I think this is one huge factor for the "pump", there just is a lot more money available for the US market.

&#x200B;

And I agree with most of your data, and will try to hedge as I see fit, but that is only US, US and US. The market isn't.

TESLA MELT UP FUCKERS!!!!
The salaried performers have quotas.  They are essentially gifting their money back and forth to meet their quotas.  

Example:

I gift you $5.  Your total earnings are $5.

You gift me $5.  My total earnings are $5. Your total earnings are still $5.

I gift you another $5.  Your total earnings are now $10.  

See the problem?

Bull traps everywhere
My 12/18 700c would appreciate that
I should clarify, the delta value is the value of your contract per dollar of underlying. So $1 of stock move = .xx on the contract. So if delta is .5 and theta is 1.0 you need $2 positive move to not open red 

Somebody can probably explain it better than I but that‚Äôs the gist

I sold when it hit 18
Something's fishy about this whole Soros announcement, along the lines of all the negative press that came out following the direct listing. Like the IBs and hedge funds were all bitter that they got left out of the usual IPO process that would have allowed them to establish their positions before the stock popped ( like they did with SNOW).

If Soros was gonna sell, why would he announce it, knowing that the negative publicity would, if anything, depress the stock price?

Seems more likely that he's loading up on shares and made this announcement to keep the price lower while he and the rest of the big money investors steadily add PLTR to their funds before the public catches on to the fact that this company is on its way to a $100B+ valuation over the next few years.

Bad idea crsr won‚Äôt go as high as NIO

I'm probably not explaining it very well.

I logged in this morning hoping to buy CIIC at its share price (around $17 at the moment) but found that with my Chase brokerage account, I could buy CIICU (units) but only at $19+ each. 

With all the hype on this one now, this stock is getting away from me, but I'm curious as to why the disparity between the actual price and what chase wants me to pay for it. Is there more in a unit than just a share?
Up enough on the year right to cash out pay taxes and buy a model 3. God damn this is tempting

They might have a future in supplying energy parts.  But their credit branch that smoothed away the cracks in their infrastructure is gone.  And there will be much less in the way of avionics in our future.

So who knows.  You could be right.  But they still cast a shadow.

I told myself, if my TSLA option order doesnt fill in 15 seconds its just not meant to be. Never filled. GG
Why is crsr going up? They didn't even announce anything new. This has to be a pump/dump.

Yes, sell them to me
Not just a theta play. You can scalp with it too. Buy a 360 or 359 put on SPY yesterday around 1:00 eastern for example would have had a huge gain in a few hours. But they can also go straight to zero just as fast. Keep bets small if you‚Äôre going to play a 0 DTE.

Word.  I will say multiple leaders have voiced that they sac'd their own positions on multiple trades so that team members could get out ahead of them and profit (they make it up in volume).  And that they work around 50-60 hours a week just on the basic benefits (alerts, zoom lessons).  Throw in another 10+ hours on the mentoring and eek, that's too much work for me but I'm glad they don't agree lol.  Its just a lot different than any other group/paid service I've come across.

At least Nio and PLTR are doing well.
Suprisingly it's holding strong around its new high. Wonder how long this lasts though. Wonder if people will be profit taking now or expect it to go even further soon.
Sorry, I jinxed it.

Godspeed retard
Nothing but I‚Äôve noticed tickers generally reverse whatever trend they showed from 9:30-10:30.
01/15/21 feels too close now so looking at the 04/21s and 01/22s.
Oh I see that you‚Äôre long pton. I thought you wanted pton below 100 cuz you had puts or something. I had some shares myself that I held from 45ish to around 110. Sold before the last earnings. I don‚Äôt know if you read the last earnings report but they‚Äôve kind of fucked themselves with manufacturing. They‚Äôre at manufacturing capacity and they said they‚Äôre expecting the delays to continue well into next year. That means growth is gonna slow down for next couple quarters. Their gross margin is also down and they said they expect it to stay down because they‚Äôre using more expedited shipping methods to try to make up for manufacturing delays. Imo it‚Äôs time to find a new play. Congrats on 400k though that‚Äôs wild!

So load up on puts. Why are you swing trading $10k on a market index when you have such high conviction about a market move in the near future? Like if you‚Äôre willing to take a loss on say, $2k, just buy $2k of SPY puts. DD has no conviction.

There are way too many $20 short term calls over the next few weeks that the big boys won‚Äôt allow it to get to that point for a while. I expect it to pop in ~month

I am in love with Corsair. Wish I bought more shares
Tesla has no reason to not to go up at least $10 today
I did my part and bought another $10,000 worth today. Been in since March...
I got in early, so my pulse is still good.
Wait for CIIC dip or buy now??
Autism has evolved into something else here.
Can you explain what that means? I am retarded

Yeah my nio calls are saving my corpse
Index funds will buy within a few days, ends on Dec 21. Others spread out.

I think there maybe mechanisms to prevent the stock jump on Dec 21. It's not risk free profit.

Also some funds that benchmark S&P500 may have bought TSLA already.

TSLA is a great company from long term view. This helps me to hold tight.
Hitting $25 next week though.
lmfao felt this
It's a sloppy top Y
wait til expiry or sell eod?
Early sells can be good for unloading bags on other members of this sub, but otherwise I agree

Honestly I post this out of complete DD not to lead anyone astray but if you haven‚Äôt gotten into NIO yet I highly suggest it because this stock is legit here for the long term. It‚Äôs going to end up being multiple hundreds worth

Wtf NIO

At least 100k come April because I sold for a bit and bought back like an idiot.

Does the english language have a more beautiful word than "short squeeze"?
More DD on PIC, when it fully merges with XL Fleet it will trade as XL. How many retards are going to buy  just because the ticker is XL? I can already imagine seeing XL XL XL all over this sub.

DKNG is up 25% in 9 days. I'm having serious first world problems with my covered calls.

I bought some!
amd moving like a penny stock
Crsr up nearly 7% still down on my option, that‚Äôs how stupid I am.
It had an IPO under absolutely perfect conditions for its industry which makes forward guidance tough to sell as being optimistic. They made a lot of money but where can they go from here?
I am with Chase, and as soon as I hopped on, they were selling CIICU and CIICW.

Units are selling for $2 more than the share price I can see elsewhere, how come?
You guys are all gay

In your 2nd chart; Buffet Indicator.  Why is your Historical Trend Line flat?  You are covering 3 decades (1990-2020).. The historical trend line for the market isn't 0%.

Not agreeing or disagreeing with your overall conclusions, just don't understand why a historical trend line for the market (over 3 decades) would be 0%.
Mango man will concede in the next 48 hours. Get ready for the pump.
Thank you for your post, your insight, and your humor. Disregard all the fucks criticizing you and such. 

These kinds of post harken back to the quality of WSB a few years ago, warms mah heart. 

With that said...WMT 1/21/23 $155c & maybe i‚Äôll consider your puts, but a month of two further out. Feb or March again, Dec seems too soon. The politics of LIFE are about to kick in full strength as we approach christmas, people need hope, and govt seeks to maintain some semblance of order and status quo. ‚ÄúWe will be okay, happy holidays; keep your head up‚Äù sorta thing. 

At least, that‚Äôs my opinion.

yes, but that shouldn't stop your dreams.
One of these whale institutions is going to launch an IPO competitor, and RKT isn't going anywhere.
the only people selling TSLA are small buyers, whales are buying and holding.

Or not

Could be

Please get to 50
What‚Äôs the play today ?
[deleted]
So yes.. buy some long calls
Why you gotta give me hope like that GME?
IV crush. The IV of the option was pricing in a larger movement in price than what actually happened after earnings this morning. Since it was a smaller move than expected, the price of your option decreased even though the underlying moves the correct direction
Tsla 475 eod

Attention fellow Autists. 'Tis time to pump the shit out of CIIC.

DraftKings when it gets to 50: üëâüëà
Buffet indicator is a terrible metric to time a crash. Could be today, could be in 5 years... do you want to potentially miss the next 5 years of irrational growth? 

Most money is made right before the bubble pops...

Also, some index doesn't represent the economy... the only thing truly suffering in this economy is tourism/hospitality commercial, real estate and aviation (for like another year), rest of the economy is doing just fine.

Imo big PE will crash (zoom e.g.), most of the reasonably priced companies will be fine with just a minor correction. I'd argue that we will see a March like recovery in Value tickers sometime next year, while growth naturally contracts.

I think you are a gay bear crash prophet and while you eventually be right, you will not be able to accurately time the big one.
Damn Pltr sucks ass. Should've put all my money in NIO like a responsible investor.
If it‚Äôs not at ATH it‚Äôs a buy for me dog
Just because of this I loaded up and am now at 46 call contracts! GODSPEED retard ü§üüèº
Is NBEV a buy?
BABA
It‚Äôs a $5k play for me. Most of that being shares.
The fuck? IV is sky high and will drop hard plus stonks don‚Äôt typically keep going up and up. And worst case scenario is he gets to keep premium AND sell his shares for an even higher price.
Are we hoping for something (500+) that they can control (great wall of 500)?
look at the theta vs. delta - the delta will be the # of dollars the underlying has to move to offset the theta, still a wild ass guess but will help inform your decision
NIO saving my ass while PLTR trying to fuck me
EOD if it keeps pumping like this. I think a lot jumping in now after earnings and IV is 'stabilised'.
Me. Have made good money recently
Rare green on baba
Shutup loser
so should i buy SKF, GLL, and ZSL?
Well you made me 50 bucks today so far, god bless

Yes but it just might work
im not in it but its only up 100% ytd, thats nothing in wsb terms
the longer you wait the better it will feel. save it till the evening
PLTR has dumped the last 3 days in the first hour. It's fine... probably.
Its probably day traders trying to scalp them profits.  As soon as it hits 499 they dip out. When it goes down they dip in.
top was yesterday
Nine hundred thousand shares? Are you paper trading?
Nobody wants to play with AAPL anymore. Its like in toy story when andy drops woody in the trash bin , ‚Äúbyeeee wooooody‚Äù

Hey to all the gay bears who stupidly believed NIO would rank and were talking shit yesterday, don‚Äôt you hate it that I‚Äôm right every single day about my stocks? Next time listen and just buy the fucking stock, hold it, and make bank bitch. NIO 70 to 80 by NIO day!!!

If I have a TSLA Friday expiring option, is it better to sell in the morning before it goes for $500? I worry that I will lose as much Theta as I gain in value?
actually though, you can at least find the retard discussion on the stock your trading. everyone here is trading the same thing lmfao

i can't believe these retards, it isnt bots either, who is buying CIIC.... retards. actual fucking people here are just following this retarded wave.

&#x200B;

fucking trade real stocks that hold supports like FIS, DG, and HD. lmfaooo made 2,000$ on FIS calls today, but its a "boomer" stock lmfao

Also, more importantly if the source of uncertainty around the market or the particular underlying stock disappears, IV drops very quickly and your options value plummets even if you got the stock price move direction correct.

Because have you seen all the post in the two months trying to pump this stock? It was an obvious pump and dump. It‚Äôs the only reason it went up.
My inner retard is tingling someone hit me with a play.
about what time should we buy those
You never bet more than 10k, because you don't even have 10k.  Your bankroll is a rubber banded roll of fivers "earned" from blowing truckers behind the dumpster behind Wendy's next to the Love's truck stop, you incestuous lot lizard.

PSA: **Stocktwits > WSB**
That's what they said last time.
hahaha i see. well, i can see florida in the "this is fine" situation so that's what i thought the joke was, lol.
I agree the market is overpriced, but don't see any reason why it will tank on any specific date. It may actually tank after we start rolling out vaccines and the economy isn't instantly fixed, because it will take a long time for everyone to get one and for our behavior patterns to return to hold.

Premise 3 and 4 have a lot of wrong information in them.
Reducing bond yields doesn't just lead to cheaper lending it also leads to less people putting money into bonds, because the rates are lower, so that money goes to stocks, Maserati purchases or whatever else. We only saw deflation in Mar/Apr, June/July had some of the highest inflation in the last 10 years.

Consumer demand in premise 5 is lower because more people are saving, not because QE isn't working.  There are just limits of what QE can do, but this would be worse without QE.

The biggest problem right now, is the economy needs more stimulus and nothing is going to come out of DC for a while.
Lmaoooooo
Woo! Let's go
My 47/48 spreads will thank you too hehehe good luck!

Renaissance is pulling up the average.  The median is far below WSB.
They are really pushing this over +$500
Debating buying into the latest thing wsb is shilling today. Pump and dump maybe, but to be fair, it often works to ride it up as long as you‚Äôre not the last one on.

draftkings o my god
What thing
Smart to get in TSLA here? Probably not. Yeah closed my weekly and looking for a reentry
May 35c if you can afford it :/
u missed out on a 20% run since ur comment
AYRO ON FIRE
I‚Äôm holding
He said he did
This guy fuks.
AND WE‚ÄôRE GREEN BABY
Maybe not. I sold my puts and will buy them back when SPY goes back up
So close.. papa Elon has been teasing me all morning
Who said anything about TSLA
anyone know what‚Äôs up with GME? just went vertical
Im pretty sure youre supposed to inverse sentiment lol
when did they change?
After some bad losses trading I actually did the thing and took maybe 2-3 months off, focused on just smart spending, paying down some debt, and my actual gay job 

that being said...PLTR it is!
Fuck da bears we pumping
How long are y'all holding CIIC? I'm probably gonna hold overnight
That's a nice meme, does it come in Normie?
Literally just looked back it was down .7% then up .4% lol but question stands
Boeing dip 

Get some
Calls right now!
Oh for sure! I‚Äôll keep holding at this stage. I‚Äôm in Canada so the fees to sell would only compound the Loss. 

It‚Äôll be fine in the long term. Might even add on the dip.
amazon dip, shooting for 4k eoy
what's the move
DUMP THE FCKING CCL ALREADY
My 11/20 ü§° call will thank youuuuu
TSLA ready for blastoff any minute now
Just hanging out at 18. 20 tomorrow? 20 Monday?
I say yes
People will just order their drugs from Amazon

Long $AMZN
Who the fuck keeps selling pltr? Lol
hell dude, look at today, it seems like it was a buy the dip??? lmfao FIS instantly bounces off hard $142 support

DG bounced off its new support of $208, now holding $210-$211 (what i believe to be its true price, before earnings, hopefully that skyrockets them to $230)

I could go on, check how many stocks held today...

anyway, bro check out dollar general. They have 17,000 stores (15,400 at the beginning of last year) and same store sales have never been down since 1983. Price target after earnings is $230, I think its a good stock considering how poor people shop in apandemic.
Common PLTR do your thing
Sad thing is your probably 90% right the inner option trader within me will come back in like a weeküòÇ
[deleted]
Draftkings won't quit
do spac stocks typically moon more than 30% on a given day? CIIC is really making history or somn? is this retard strength indicative of a 20 dollar price target by tm? i think so
> Or lend it to rich people / companies for buybacks and all the assets listed above?

Ding, ding, ding.
PSTH...get in while you can, no downsides.
FCEL growth looking like NIO‚Äôs growth when you cut through all the WSB bs
TSLA is going to break 500 in the next hour. I can feel it in my plums.
shut the fuck up

My only worry is that they hit IV

This is it. Next test the resistance is broken.
I‚Äôm seeing a lot of üåàüêª comments here regarding PLTR which is only strengthening my resolve to hold
MARA is joining the fun lets goooooooo
It took a long time to dig out of a big hole
What‚Äôs dipping that we buy? What‚Äôs dipping that we buy? What‚Äôs dipping that we buy? What‚Äôs dipping that we buy? What‚Äôs dipping that we buy?
HERE WE GO TSLA

Made some fat stacks on ciic, feels good to be part of the hype, get in get out and then get back in whne it's at a good price
Petition to give this retard a dollar only need 15,999 to commit.
nio mooning
PLUG to the moon!
All valid points except maybe the girlfriend part.
Buy long dates and only plan to stay in the position for around a month. Theta on 90-120 dte isn't bad.
This battle for 500 is exciting, I have to admit

Just bend over TSLA and take it! Take it you sexy sloot
BABA with the green dildo to save my portfolio
[removed]
Dont care what anyone says

The rug pull happened and it was September

NIO is pretty much the only garunteed long term winner as far as rapid growth. Y‚Äôall were retarted if you doubted that. I don‚Äôt give advice to fuck people I want y‚Äôall to make money if you‚Äôre willing to listen. RIP bears get fucked again
How are you holding up?
[deleted]
BABA in the green, we are truly living the end times.
PLTR diamond hands!
Nope.. I heard lvl 2 has a $20 sell wall.  Can someone validate that?

If thats the case it will stay around 17-19 for a little while before it explodes. 

Allegedly
Bought a Bj 40 put yesterday when share price was 43, today the share price is 41ish but my put value has decreased, can anyone explain how that happened?
PLTR leaps on that dip
If we break it I will attribute our victory to your selfless purchase my friend
BABA Launch!
You are totally right, but it will hapend in 1Q 2021 no? there is a lot of time to cash out , meanwhile its free money.. maybe im wrong?

Nio green dildo
You had gains? Must be nice.....
I feel like I might've bought baba literally at the perfect time.
In Trading no emotions, if lose sell the cat and yolo again
I bitched out on CIIC figured it had to dip. Enjoy your trendies boys
I know we're all experts on chinese politics here, what we thinking with BABA... Gonna keep bleeding for a while? Been moving down real slow since the drop

Expecting a short squeeze to 50
[deleted]
See you on the other side brother.
Haha dime a dozen.
If you bought CSIQ shares or leaps I'd totally hold. The bi-facial panels are a small part of total solar panel business, and CSIQ is one of the most fairly priced solar stocks on the market. It will grow with the solar push in the coming years.
Amzn really been roleplaying as BABA lately smh
What ticker?
Contradicting yourself big time there.
A lot if its within a few days.

oh wait, the DD god did :(
Tesla needs some momentum to break the $500 sell wall
I totally agree. This company is great. Their P/E is low. Underrated company! Also low short float. I can‚Äôt wait to keep making money on this company.

Eat butt

Now you are a true bull
Pltr is going to bust out still today right?
That was inspirational
Etsy mooning üëÄ
Uhhh ROKU????? Shit went off like a fucking rocket...
How heavys your fomo?!? üòù
No.
Explain to me why NAKD is worth calls? I don‚Äôt see it
Look at this FOMO at near all time highs again. Tech, small caps - everything just being bid up. I guess the continued thesis of Fed goes BBRRRR
That's called stage-1 ignition checklist inspection and hazard area sweep completion in preparation for launch.

Closed morning gap and now you can resume small sell off... please üêªüåà
Read up on the company they are 2nd to telsa and not by much you will regret assuming this is jusr another ev company or something.  Its not a pump and dump company!
Tesla can‚Äôt go down
Been playing small Tsla swings with dailies selling at 20% gains with about 25k in leverage all morning, up $20k on that.
I never bet more than 10k on any short-term options play. It's called bankroll management kiddo, and why I'm not broke.
Once again, this sub know nothing, just a bunch of vested interests competing against each other
Man I wish I had this much money to invest. Growing from 600$
I can't believe it. I finally did it.

I finally bought options on the stock that everybody is using as a shelter during a market downturn, instead of doing the exact opposite and having everything expire worthless.
NIO!!!!!!!

Thank you Papa Elon. You have saved my account
It is! It‚Äôs the S&P 500 going back to 1871 on a logarithmic scale. I made it! And I‚Äôm a multimillionaire who retired at 36 for what it‚Äôs worth.
u must be trading the wrong TSLA
its like the CRSR guy said..daytraders?  500 Million market cap
I bought 100 shares yesterday at $45.
COTY is still on my watch list when we all became makeup experts and that shit is up 15% today
Just want to say no matter what you‚Äôre going through or how you‚Äôre feeling, I love you all.

Even you fucks who post a bunch of spam in here.
theyre üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêªthat are just mad they saw the DD when it was $15 and didnt buy
We need CIIC to shoot to the moon again. Any predictions?
Tendies > politics
Thanks! Just saw it on Twitter. Why a bummer. Really wish I hadn‚Äôt moved some cash out of SOLO and into CSIQ for earnings. 

Live and learn!
Not sure. It seems pretty nutty to me. Just bought a 40c 12/18 and letting it ride
I think I‚Äôll hold Tesla until Monday. Don‚Äôt fail me now Elon üôè
Trusting nobody but NIO at this point
Calling TSLA a boomer stock üòÇ Maybe Buffett will get more involved then.
Lol, so much angst around PLTR.

It's over for the moment. Sell the news.
crash will happen when the fed raises rates in 2023, not sooner not later
could see a NIO rally today and possibly into Next week
bought one 475p lol
give us a +1% day baby! you can do it SPY
im so excited to see some robin hooders play 0 dte since they can now. should make wsb a little more exciting
Yeah got in AH at $16.25 and dipped out 5 mins before open. Nit a big deal went with how I felt and expected a dip. No skin off my back
RIOT is going to moon today I can feel it in my plums
Die uber
This was amazing
Hey CIIC, keep going up you donut
SOLO $10 EOD??

Cough cough....
The fundamental problem with gay bears is that they spend their time thinking about how other people are wrong instead of using their smooth brains to find opportunity. Nobody likes gay bears. Bulls don't concern themselves with the opinions of gays.
**looks like meat's back on the menu boys!**
Edit: So it seems I just had to shout this out into the world. It updated now lol
PLTR please break 19, everyone will be happy
 ‚ÄúbUt MuH rUgPuLl‚Äù- gay bears in shambles
At this point not sure why WSB isn't dumping NIOs, XPEV, etc., rally is over and jumping into RIDE which is American.
Plug will haunt me. It was my free stock and I didn‚Äôt go all in when it was only 2$
Am I the only one who thinks PSTH is a giant scam? ‚ÄúBut dude the deal is coming soon!‚Äù
Urge to buy...rising.  Must...not...FOMO.

GAHHHHHHHH \*purchases 2500 1dtes\*
$LOW $155-160 calls for january are virtually free money.  The sell off was way, way overdone.  IV is so reasonable.
That‚Äôs MR retard to you
Damn sold Roku at 230 last week
Sold my 11/20 yesterday for a bigly loss. You‚Äôre welcome
[deleted]
This is the part where tech takes over
28% thats alot. If that sector dies they better find another great company to pinch. Affirm ia big in the watch community, but most there pay with dat cash
What the f PLUG
Ur wish finally came true.
Never buy before 10
Yeah, I've had a shit week, really need to see some green
Cant go tits up
Tech stonk, people moving money to companies recovering from covid lows

Jesus, if you sell PLTR because of George f‚Äôn Soros, I‚Äôm disowning this sub. It took the old bastard this long to learn what they do? Honestly, screw him. Sounds like a üåà üêª with ethics. That‚Äôs not the WSB I know. We don‚Äôt care about that crap here. Don‚Äôt be some pussy bitch and sell. Hold the line.
Dude calm down it‚Äôs wsb it has always been this way
[deleted]
So I am yet again telling y‚Äôall if you want to make money get in on NIO before 60. You heard it here first. My bank account proves that I give good advice. And to everyone thinking about selling off please do it because I want to buy more dips
NVDA should have invested more time in their 3080 supply instead of leather jackets
Well to be fair its going into the snp500 and they increase the value to 540 and many are saying it can reach 1000 all the way to 15000 per share but I think 1000 to maybe 2500 more realistic.
Is soros just a dumb boomer? Yes
My fun GME FD needs several more dollars of pump... maybe that wasn‚Äôt fun, just stupid
Spy you fuck
I wish it is a WSB trade that tips TSLA to over 500
lol wmt this morning is just a vertical line up
Gotcha

Market erases big red open....meanwhile AAPL: ü•¥

This boomer stonk is like me, pretty much given up on life.
Is there someone who doesn‚Äôt want Tesla at 500 or smth?!??
Bloomberg terminals are the most boomer shit ever. The user interface looks like it‚Äôs straight out the 90s
Yo what's GME doing
Sometimes I ignore watching the chart for my positions and just read comments here and that lets me know how my retard portfolio is doing.
Dip swallowed
I was cash gang but jumped into TSLA calls because why not. Cash sitting there is boring and banks suck. Maybe put some in shitcoin and hold?
Woahhhhhj
Jack Ma needs to make a TikTok being tag teamed by Xi and Vice Premier Liu He for BABA sentiment to shift.  

He seriously pissed off Xi and the CCP.
It's okay just break 498 and then we'll worry about 500
If Corsair has another 12% i don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll think of this market anymore ü§°. Market cap is so low that this volume is probably spiking it with all the day traders. Cashed our my 12/18 35c today
Triggering my stop loss
NiO and Erection , name a better duo
give us 500 elon
anyone here think BA can finally stay above 200 ?!

Nice work bears! 35 seconds today
üò©üòÇ
Imagine selling PLTR on the daily opening dump
#PUSSIES STOP SELLING


^^please ^^babes
Lol. George soros is selling his whole stake in it soon so watch out for the price dump. Buy puts that expire in a month if you actually want to make some money
Bigly
500 is the level to watch if it breaks this bitch is running
Looks like a lot of bullish to just be in a ‚Äúput‚Äù position. You can‚Äôt time it that‚Äôs correct and you will most likely lose money on all your positions. 

Just short shares you cheap fuck
yall remember when a monkey w darts beat those hedge fund guys with degrees in economics
Tell me why the Stonks Boss doesn‚Äôt want UBER past $50?
Goodspeed PLTR, you magnificent autist. Onwards to $20
It‚Äôs $17 confirmed but can‚Äôt find a way to put order in. How about you?
Nice day so far thanks to TGT and NIO
Wth are my TSLA calls not changing. As if IV is THAT high??
trader, not retard
bought at 19 :D
While people paper hand this shit, whales have been gobbling up most of the shares. Sure that rkt doesn‚Äôt have a lot of shares floating but it‚Äôs stupid af that 80+% of the company shares are owned by whales.  Rkt makes the most from refinancing and there are still roughly 70% of the people that could save at least 100 dollars a month from refinancing so the market from that is far from dead. Personally I‚Äôm lowkey just as confused as you are cause with the 1bil buyback within 2 years can‚Äôt stop this pos of a manipulate stock from going downward, I don‚Äôt know what can.
PLTR 20

 I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN
I have 12/4 $140 puts on em
Only losers are still buying NIO. üòÜ
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
SOLO is actually insane lately. Missed opportunities
GME go for launch!!

I guess people think CCP will put a stranglehold on it.

go fuck yourself clown
Does not deserve /WSB
I would‚Äôve thought PLtr was up 5 points the way y‚Äôall are talking about it.
SPY 351 puts
Why is this happening its like having a random boner but not knowing what set it off, a cool breeze through the window maybe? The smell of a bee? Why is tesla pumping and why is my cock rock hard
I should‚Äôve trusted myself yesterday and went cash gang until I could scoop BA calls this morning

Don't you love it when you place limit orders, the stuck goes up so you buy at market price instead, then it goes back to the level of your limit order ? I know I do lol.
TSLA about to try 500 again.
Just watched that like 50 times hahaha üòÜ
FCEL 12/18 $4.5 and $5.5

NIO 2/19 $60
This is perfect

Well done Op, well done

Hop on next stop tendie town

UPWK put options for $45 getting premium printing money today.  Up from $5 during covid crash in mid $30's will only go up more
Fuck I bought spy puts
The cons outweigh the positives. I get it though, nobody wants debt, especially over some dumbass degree that wont help much but im just a firm believer in pulling yourself up by the boot straps and doing things yourself. I wish school was cheaper, its fucking rediculous but they keep bloating the administration and adding extra shit that ‚Äúwill help students‚Äù like a writing lab or math lab or counseling or advising or ...

Need a pull back to 479 so I can buy back in? Is this realistic? :(
Tesla too low spy too high
PLTR trying to go up, come on buddy you can do it!
LOL at any pussies who got spooked out of PLTR in the last 20 minutes.
pltr is the best covered call stock to play in the world
I have a very similar position, I personally don‚Äôt think TSLA and SPY will be correlated for the next month
It‚Äôll be $23 by Christmas
wtf is pltr doing chart is wierd af
Depends on the time frame and the volatility. If its close to expiry then the answer is a lot.

**Bulls study for hundreds of hours for the ACT, go to Top 10 undergraduate-ranked Ivy League colleges, attain their Master's then get their P.H.D.s, perform decades of research on various vaccines and immunological diseases, and are eventually awarded various Peace Prizes for their contributions to science**

Don't worry, pltr is going up up regardless of what happened the first 30min today.

Someone asked me about it in the thread. I don‚Äôt own any and I posted why.
How do you quantify that? Compare their revenue and ebitda to their nearest competitor COOP. COOP bought back a paltry $100m back in July, no dividend. RKT buying back 1B and talking about a dividend to return cash to investors over a buyback (they got pushback over doing buybacks instead of a divvy). Although sometimes good companies don‚Äôt make good stocks.

Oh 100%. I have a peloton and trust me no one who has one is giving it up to use another app that doesn‚Äôt come with equipment. But people who just use the peloton app for at home workouts might switch to Apple fitness instead. Even if they don‚Äôt though, pton price will still drop the day Apple releases fitness +. If you look at when apple announced it a couple months back you can see pton drops mid day during the presentation
Very confused boner today.

Someone tell me TSLA isn't in the S&P yet and that it will be okay

REITs have had a run up after the vaccine but are still historically cheap. You have to pick stocks and not buy etf‚Äôs- you may actually have to read the annual reports to find out who their tenants are. Same with selective Retailers had value pre vaccine, probably still some right now, industrials as well. Stock screen for lowish debt and dividend yield coverage and you will find a bunch that will likely beat the S&P.  Also banks are cheap and over the next few years you will get outsized returns if you pick right.

Temporarily yes, I'd wait for a solid dip personally.

It'll definitely dip even if not this week. But almost certainly this week IMO.
What is your review on it ? Curious to know
What's the play
Was gonna buy premarket at $15.80 but waited for a dip that never came. Avg price $17.30 now rip
I am way too over leveraged in AMZN, I should have sold yesterday for a profit while I had the chance...
how do we know if it‚Äôs a hedge or a bearish play?
wsb seems ultra bull on tslut.  Buying the pootz.

5x tsla 11/20 450p
It needs to do a lot more than that.
No, stock will be fine.
Would anyone who got in PLTR at 10 buy more now?
Goodbye NVDA

you told me and i didnt listen, forgive me dad

I feel the same. I'm only in with about 30% of what I think I should have been. Too late now.

But there is still a chance nothing will happen these day and we will only have an announcement in January or February, in which case I expect it to dip back to 22-23. If it does I'm probably going all in too (with my cash - not liquidating any existing assets).

How about ET!
Why the fuck didnt anyone else buy PLUG after the crash this week? It was free fucking money

No hold. Remember: Diamond Hands
Soros dumping PLTR, not stoping us!!
Did I finally buy a 1DTE SPY call that's actually not going to fuck me for once?
Long term yes, you can make some actual predictions,  and barring any unusual or unexpected events, you can probably do better than pure luck. I‚Äôm talking short term for sure. It‚Äôs just gambling.
Maybe not

nothing is ever certain but it's a pretty high probability
That sound about right. Generally you start seeing the shape the market is going to take for the day by 10-11
My Tesla call I sold on Tuesday is 4.6k from 1.3k how do I stop feeling sad about this

CUNT - Ciig, Unity, Nio, Tesla
We on a SOLO trip from here to Mars. Are you in? Or are you?

What‚Äôs the move on PLTR for today
Me too, but also all the free leverage expires tomorrow. I was hoping for any kind of commentary from Chamath the last couple weeks. Still wondering if that lawsuit is legit or if it‚Äôs permanently clover health

"Let me just hit the stop losses on all your puts real quick before I dump this bitch..." - SPY, probably
Calls on spongebob

Why can‚Äôt you just fucking use google like the rest of us?
I Bought CHEGG at 75... should I sell ...
Wtf spy I said die
I miss the Roku make you Broku comments. Much simpler times.
Buy the dip and hold long. I think this is going to be a huge company.
I think the only people that complain about this are people who haven‚Äôt been here long. Been here for years, and the sub changes a lot... that‚Äôs just how it works. If you don‚Äôt like the current state, come back in 6 months and it will be different.

Will say that the new mods are legit retarded. Miss when we could fuck with the old ones and have fun and everyone got a laugh. Now nobody talks to them rofl
I just bought DKNG 11/20 $49.5c , DKNG better pump it up.
How‚Äôs that looking bud

This belongs to r/fiction
Amazon is kill?
I mean your right possible break out above 50..
NIO you big beautiful bastard
tesla give me tendies like you did in the past
Homie there‚Äôs been ppl saying we‚Äôre gonna crash since a year ago. The markets have gone full retard you can‚Äôt rationalize it anymore
If I had a lot of free cash I'd be looking at 200+ TGT strikes for March.
You can quite literally read the Greeks on your god damn option and figure it out y o u r s e l f
FYI -- Kerrisdale just shorted this, and they are very good
Hoping this is just the morning head fake and we start heading red around 1030
Lmao i averaged down at open i had the ones that expire tomorrow and bam shit sky rocketed after that lol sold for a 40% gain
Crazy how PSTH is also rising on CIIC. 

YEAR OF THE SPAC
Um these SOLO leaps are fucking printing
Thank you
FB is so trashy
Hush
Ugh. To FOMO into CIIC or not...
PINS short
I opened a synchrony card for an interest-free car repair and used the cash to play NIO... now the repair is free. #Synchrony
CSIQ beats earnings? Down 9%. Fuck stocks.
Yeah idk why people act like you have to pick one
Shittiest stock ever
High risk
Right I want my puts to play out
All the analysts that have raised their price targets are Asian. They aren‚Äôt doing it because of the company they‚Äôre doing it for the motherland. Fucking sleeper agents. In a month they‚Äôll be investigated for pumping their numbers and it‚Äôs going to be discovered they‚Äôve only sold like 100 cars. There is no SEC in china

Mother fucking word :(
Dumbest shit i‚Äôve ever seen
Sold a Strangle in BILI for earnings, never heard of them. Closed for 50% profit üòé
I've just noticed that there is often a dip around 950
God I hope so
Thank you OP for this informative post! Really appreciate the effort. I‚Äôm a bystander to this so I‚Äôll follow up in a year.
Nio

*HES THE ONE*
AHA!!! You fell for it. I reveal my trap card, Unemployment and Covid Wave 2. This card makes SPY GO DOWN. And this eliminates all your cards and takes all your lifepoints!
My patience is just razor thin. I exit out of stuff too early all the time.
Nio will definitely end around 45 let's be real
FCEL üëÄ
Idk but literally just picked up a couple 41c weeklies and now you‚Äôre making me feel retarded
If you hate money then stay away from CIIC. +20 EOD +25 EOW +30 EOM
so according to this sub the future of the economy is RGB gamer products, shady data companies, and chinese electric vehicles. honestly sounds about right. cyberpunk future
HEY YOU FKN SUITS, WE ALL LOVE PLTR, WE WILL KEEP BUYING IT IF YOU LET US KEEP OUR TENDIES THEN YOU CAN SELL ANOTHER DAY
lol love watching PLTR shake you paper hand poors every morning
This gave me cancer
Looks like its gonna dump
Don‚Äôt FOMO too late
I shorted NIO and lost. Fuck you.
Windows is awesome
1.2 B contract with UPS, backed by BlackRock, you think it is a pump and dump? Lmao
If TSLA breaks that huge 500 wall it's going to 550
Are you holding even after this? Am I dumb to think this can go even higher to 10+ soon?
CRSR while you can tons of room for growth
Solo single handedly my saving my portfolio rn
If it holds 502,a run up is highly likely
Jumped out of CIIC at 17.80 would def get back in $14-15
too much IV. Sell call credit if bearish
TSLA 530???
Solo is an ugly ass tricycle
Pltr hit 20 so I can dip

Is it wrong to think of my CIIC shares as long dated options? XD
Just to add on too that, a while back in the year there were talks of us stopping the site development because of them not having enough money to finish the site

They look great on paper
lol calls it is
CIIC. Super small market cap. Just wait until they get more recognition
Today i sold my April calls on arcimoto for a 30% profit (still keeping 200 stocks), and bought COTY and PLTR calls for febraury. I started trading like 3 days ago and this shit feels unreal, it really seems like i'm not using "real" money, dafuq?
I have 50 contracts at 6. Finally making something
Relax dog, just the usual morning dump
im thinking of buying spy puts, someone please talk me out of it
Tesla I am rooting for you
TSLA 530 today
SOLO engaging that hyperdrive today üöÄüöÄ
Can we start banning these CIIC retards? No option plays and it's such a obvious pump and dump
Of course
Why be a bull or a bear? Just play the market as is.

Tesla too high,  how to play now?
Looks like a good day to not look at the portfolio. Off to the gym I go
Monday +100% up now -30%
Wrong way, bozo. It's on a short squeeze. GM deal closing imminent.
I have a sell order set on a 0.01 contract expiring tomorrow lol

Would that do it?

Edit: Found that pesky PLTR 20c I set yesterday.
IPOC?
Calls on draft kings are still relatively cheap.  Free money. Just buy stupid january and feb calls 5-10% OTM and let it ride.
Just getting more cheaper at this point this bitch gonna launch.
Looks like everyone who wanted to buy Pltr based on the news bought during AH last night and nobody thought "Hey i'll buy at open"

Except us.
Sure unless it doesn't
Got out of my TSLA 475c 11/20 at open. Thank you for my first experience with TSLA tendies, Elon.  Still holding my 12/4 525c
How do you see this?
This thing just went from 1/2 to 3/4 in 6 hours.  Calls it is.
SAVE will double their current price go long

With options you would be outside the galaxy already.

Razer (RAZFF) is the next CRSR
I tip you my hat Sir
bull flags on QQQ holding up nicely and providing heavy support

At this rate imma just hold my JMIA calls forever lol...

Let‚Äôs go PTON :)
Actually made me lol
Ok I sold tesla as I expect a cup and handle to 460 first as it reject the resistance of 499 like twice one in August one today
It's all over the place wtf
Don't go down there PLTR, you won't like it.
you literally are just drawing lines.... on lines...
CIIC short squeeze?
Opposite
Your an idiot. I knew that company was shit and I bet you listened to all the people say pump it.
agree 100%, last two times i bought puts (ZM and DOCU) not only had I timed it terrible, but had I had a longer strike date I would have made as shitton of cash. I see its totally possible and I was foolish on my timing and strike price/date, but I seem to have a better feel for other strategies. 

still, if i feel the vibe of put buying, specifically on a stock and not the SPY, i  might try doing it and just adjust the strike date.
Really mad I sold all my SOLO calls earlier for a loss. But at least FCEL has made up for it so far
Guess who‚Äôs the moron that sold 5 TSLA 420 calls on Tuesday morning
CRSR $40 EOD
who‚Äôs in on COTY?
What is cost of $600 12/24?
Bought 15 min ago, and as you can see the stock is down already. Consider this a gift, now you can get a discount.

NIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Seriously. I'm already deep itm (March $30C from back when it was at $25 ish). I'm expecting it to get back to $40 sooner than later, but it's so choppy and annoying every day that I might cut bait and move that money somewhere else.
How long we holding ciic?
So Megacap tech is just dead? Lol
Correct. All you have to do is sit tight with those funds tied up for possibly months until it all eventually recovers. Ez pz.
NIO doing what it does best...üöÄüöÄ
The swings on Tesla today are fucking insane
WORK to low 30s and DKNG to mid 50s in the next week or so.
You mean buy at 950
I just feel bad for BABA this point.
Yeah I need this shit to get pumped up so I can collect more premium on my OTM calls üòÇüòÇ fr tho I think it‚Äôs just the Covid market fucking it. I mean they announce a billi in stock buybacks aka 45.6% of the free float and the stock stays stagnant lmfao how does that make sense?
Fcel got downgraded and said fuck. It‚Äôs up 9% lol
Yes we do...
Half and half
Pltr dipped to mid-17s yesterday morning and yall freaked out and then boom she blasted off at 10am. Maybe today same same?

Going to $230 by Christmas. Hop on board.
I just prefer to get money faster through $NIO

Never too late
Nah. Nothing on mainstreet has impacted wallstreet all year.

They will make sure the big businesses stay open while your mom and pop shops close up, possibly forever.

We'll come out of this with the only stores left being Costco and Walmart, with insane unemployment, and still be at ATHs.

I need to do this
CIIC 30 percent up. How high does it go
Just a cursory glance as charts today indisputably confirms we're drilling. Hopefully down to election level supports at least where I've got a big fad waiting for the Vanguard, and I do specifically mean Raniere, who will EM this market into new ATH

So the thing I sold a covered call on yesterday is doing the best...SHM

NNDM

Anyone else in this?
AAPL you suck
These dips ALWAYS get bought
So tired of this boomer stock.
I think it would just enable colleges to freely raise their prices to whatever the fuck, knowing the government will just pay it off. But I am one of those bitter folks who scraped to pay off my $40k debt over the last eight years and I‚Äôd be lying if it said it didn‚Äôt annoy me that everyone taking irresponsible loans could just be let off the hook
BABA gonna swing back to 300+ in two weeks
Look at CIIC go.
And price up 2%.

You're right, fml... Stonks are crazy

CIIC ciicw doing well
Is ciigu same as Ciig?
Gyna evs rise and fall together
Once again, CIIC will be 20+ by next week
UPS is already planning on buying these electric vans. CIIC is going to skyrocket.
But the Fed...
Is anyone here really making money?
long dated options move to slow haha
Long term that doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Sure they can kick Tesla out and drive their NIO‚Äôs for the next decade but what are they gonna do when EVERYTHING switches to electric energy? Can‚Äôt power your house with NIO like you will be able to with Tesla
Because its a pump and dump, enjoy losing your money
thanks man, that is a nice comment
That makes a lot more sense.  I‚Äôm doing the same, going into value stocks with CSPs or stock when it looks like there‚Äôs still some room to run.  

I honestly don‚Äôt even like buying Puts anymore...  Been burned way too many times.
where do you think it's stopping?
just give me my motherfucking money
Someone tell spy to get down and stay down

The current p/e of the s and p is 31.24. Last year it was 21.75. During the dotcom boom it was over 200.  It‚Äôs an order of magnitude lower than the dotcom boom.
No it literally just started. EVs only go up.
Nio calls giving me A G I T A baby

Palantir is a shitty and horrible company
Buy the PLTR morning dip before mooning
It's not too late for CIIC.   
Are stonks gay? YES, but it's 2020, being gay is in!
If completely changing the system to adapt free trades didn‚Äôt cause any harm. 

I doubt calling people out on bullshit will.
fuck that dogshit company. i bought at 28 a while ago and took the L and sold. Made all the money back with Nio and PLTR. join the gang  üöÄ
So realtalk now, is [marketwatch.com](https://marketwatch.com) really the better [investing.com](https://investing.com)? 

Am I the idiot here for using [investing.com](https://investing.com) to screen during work?
What‚Äôs NIO‚Äôs resistance line? I can‚Äôt pull up ToS run
If this is the kind of steam power PLTR has we‚Äôre fucked
Once again, JMIA

Yall need to jump in before it's too late.
holy shit. I did it. I actually sold on the top for TSLA.right at 497... watch it boomerang to 600 now....
PLTR getting hit by profit takers, next stop to the üåù

Based on the amount of buys that came in for tesla this morning this is gonna be the lowest it goes today. It's pretty safe to go calls on it this morning. Id say a good time to sell is either tomorrow if it makes a downturn. If not then Id say tuesday.
It could be debated, what exactly is shit

This guy: baffled that market goes up
and we constantly verify the old ways to lose money still work
Did ET lower their dividend? I got paid $78 four months ago but only $38 today. Doing the math based on their annual $.61 seems like $38 is the correct divident payment.
Time to get back in on WMT?

Got out of this fkin degenerate market, I advise the same to you all too
I apparently bought a call debit spread instead of a put credit spread yesterday and I‚Äôm super confused as to how. I‚Äôm also really confused how it‚Äôs not profitable when it‚Äôs well ITM now.
We only sell shit like NIO or the DAX.
#TSLA LMAO
The way NIO moves is not good for my heart. looks like its about to dump then goes on a fat reverse green candle
I can't believe I sold my SOLO calls last week

Too much bearish sentiment here, we are going up
I think we should just face it. CCL is on some bullshit and won‚Äôt die again
Atvi at bottom of range, look to hit 78 in 2 weeks
Tsla breaks 500 then we clear for moon landing
SIX is the easiest PUT play with that green candle out nowhere
Yessss
I'm so annoyed right now. I was a day away from locking up nice theta gains in financial tickers, and these damn lockdowns just fucked all those positions in a span of 30 mins.
**IF** student loans are forgiven you can bet your butt there'll be some terms and conditions the indebted would have to agree to.  Perhaps the possibility of never having true ownership over anything ever again.  Their material possessions would become the property of the state or central bank.
Look at that dip being bought
DKNG going üìà

i really dont understand BABA, is it just algos trading with each other? who the fuck is still selling this shit, why didnt the moron sold like yesterday to a higher price?!
Sometimes i'd really love to see who is actually buying stocks. Like is it algos buying NKLA now after the cult bought it yesterday on a someone linking a webpage on GM tha'ts been up for like a month already?
Did all the shorters and weak hands finally get shaken out of NIO?

They are at a severe competitive disadvantage with a huge debt load.

[https://stocknews.com/news/cpe-callon-petroleum-company-shows-signs-of-hitting-a-bottom/](https://stocknews.com/news/cpe-callon-petroleum-company-shows-signs-of-hitting-a-bottom/)

1. Competitor WLL and DEN has emerged from bankruptcy where common stock was wiped out, and 95% of the market cap was given to the bond holders.   This means WLL and DEN is producing oil at $4 to $5 CHEAPER per barrel because of no interest payments.
2. While the incoming Biden administration isn't going to ban fracking, they are definitely going to severely limit the number of NEW oil rigs on federal lands and increase regulations.  As the bonds of CPE are due in 2023, and the typical oil rig has an 18 month life, that is a horrible intersection of falling revenues and debt repayment.

Maybe can pump and dump due to small float, but definitely bankruptcy is looming.  Just make sure to get out before the big boys crush the hell out of this stock if the pump works.
NO YOU DIDNT

I made the CIIC DD post. Once it reaches $25 next week, I will make another DD post about the next big play..
brrrrr
Tesla gonna have a huge sell wall at 500 but if it makes it past it it'll be glorious. Easily will fly to ATH as people buy in prep for it. Until then we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
You retards actually selling PLTR? Lol
Yes it does idiot, stocks were down like 30% in April, they‚Äôre up 60% since. Can‚Äôt crash from a bottom
You think the vaccine hype was overdone because companies like Oxy went from 10 to 12, and that the Peloton rally taking it to over 1400x p/e ratio is still good value? You are so sure that you purchased USD 1,000,000 of it?

So predictable, just wait until people take their eyes off it. Then it will moon, it was trending on google just 2 days ago
Got 1000 worth of palantir shares. I'm gonna be a rich grandpa some day
y ccl up?
Agree, only concern is height of rocket.

Look at 3Y chart, its slowly going down bc divident etc. Add six months, extra debt and slow outlook. 

They will stay alive bc of the assets (who else would buy and operate cruiseships), but doesnt look super worthwhile.
Someone with a bunch of penny stocks told me I can't have thousands of dollars on just TSLA and PLTR.

Shit, sold that SPY put at open and it's still tanking

Ah well, 300% is 300%

No, I'm comparing it to all other growth companies. It is priced to grow faster than any growth company ever has in history, and not just faster, but orders of magnitude faster. I think that's highly improbable. Your money your choice good luck.
I am the one who made the DD post on CIIC. This will be 25 by next week.
You must be new here

Cant tell if this is an attack or serious inquiry but the answer is because they're providing a service and education and deserve to be rewarded for their work like any job.

It is insanely stressful to do call outs for others let alone with any type of consistent accuracy.  Throw in dedicating their weekends to teaching others, seems kinda cheap compared to college tuition.

Don't have to go with them was just sharing what helped me since they asked.

*"Wow, son, that's a lot of money!"* his dad replied. *"If you keep this up, you could make a career out of this!"*

**"Uh huh,"** his son nodded. **"Heh heh. I was just about to say that,"** he said, as he started to sniff his own farts and pick his nose.

*"What did you invest in, pray tell?"* his dad asked. *"I might even throw in some money with you, since you're making so much!"*

**"I bought this thing called 'calls.' I read some news on something happening with Tesla, and it was REALLY good news! So, I thought, hey, it's probably going to go up, right? And then it did! And I made money!"** his son said happily. **"This is way easier than I thought!"**

I have a small business in the luxury industry and my sales are usually correlated to that week‚Äôs stock performance. My business did well during Biden‚Äôs announcement for President, but recently has been much slower than usual. My options have also been very shaky as of late, and I definitely believe the stock market will have to rejoin the real economy again. Liquidated my options yesterday and waiting to see what happens.

What the hell are you talking about? I‚Äôm pretty sure the PC gaming industry is not anywhere near close to dying, I seriously have no fucking idea where you‚Äôre getting this vibe. The fact that you haven‚Äôt heard of Corsair makes me think you actually don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. I am not a gamer at all, I play video games once in a blue moon, but even I know what Corsair is. Anyone who has ever owned a PC for gaming in the last decade or more knows what Corsair is.
ü§£
i saw, but with ciic, they announced merger yesterday and its mooning, so when this gonna pull back, huh?
You aren‚Äôt wrong, but you see the reason everyone put their money into Corsair is because they ARE worth it to get in for the long term. You can say oh well it‚Äôs all luck and I guess in the short term sure it‚Äôs luck that it ran up so fast. The thing is though that the company, when it ipo‚Äôd was absolutely undervalued. They ipo‚Äôd at 1.3 billion and did 451 million in revenue in one quarter. That‚Äôs telling you something
Because he didn't say it's technically a bad investment.

I just finished a consult for a small PC peripheral company, and I believe you're mistaken. If anything, the market is accelerating. 

Even dipshit Best Buy is stocking computers of a level that five years ago would have been unheard of. They also offer every component necessary to build your own system as well, which is incredibly convenient when you're in a pinch or don't wanna wait for Newegg, or don't have a large PC warehouse in your city.

Consoles are fun, and are an easy way for kids to get into gaming. There are some titles that are best experienced on a console. You don't have to "know" anything, you just shove the game into the tray/hard drive and go. However, they lack a critical function; modularity. Once someone sees how easy it is to be faster by replacing one component, they often go all-in. You can stay way faster than any new console in perpetuity. 

CPU development, the multiplicity of custom cases, fans, cooling, lighting, peripherals, not to mention faster and faster, more customizable RAM, four-digit PSUs, SSDs (*all within Corsair's realm*), not to mention the arms race of the video cards isn't happening and being sold to make Word run faster. It's for and due to gamers, period. 

Due to these facts, having a PC is ultimately a better value. You can buy/build something to YOUR taste, instead of a cookie-cutter console that always has to go away if something go wrong. You can replace parts for less than what a console costs over time, and be cutting-edge @ all times.

to be honest, im not as confident in OPs position as he is. He even said it himself, how the fuck do you time this?

thats what I meant by actually understand the market, and you seem to understand it because you're asking the right questions

the trend is showing recovery, but the data says we should be flat/down due to overvaluations. the best we can do is just sit, wait, watch prices some more, and buy a dip.

I hope I answered your question, because nobody who trades know what they're doing. Its just about getting an edge, I dont think OPs edge is enough considering how the money is actually flowing. Timing bubbles is hard as shit. In fact, look at Sept 1st-4th, was that really a bubble? Who knows, maybe we just needed a correction. OP is saying we should have a correction, and I agree, \*\*but I'm not playing the correction, im playing a stock like DG or small caps like AES because DG has earnings coming up and there seems to be a rotation in these value names.\*\*

you feel me? I'm confident in my DG and AES positions because of the overall picture that OP gives. Thats why Im not holding AAPL calls or SPY calls, but im also not holding puts.
Interesting read! Thx for the input.

This is literally all hindsight. You could make the same ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù about any other stock and come to the same conclusion, you‚Äôre not going to be right with any greater probability than chance. Easy to look back after you made the lucky call and say ‚Äúclearly this is why it went up, it was objectively obvious‚Äù. It‚Äôs all luck, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise. Unless you are an institution, then it‚Äôs literally just big money power, highly advanced algorithms, and taking advantage of dumb money (us).

It‚Äôll probs get there. It‚Äôs very entertaining
Quick give me a 1000 bagger
Which ticker to gamble my rent today?
Yes!!!! I think this is the first Rick and morty reference I‚Äôve ever seen on this sub
:/
Been eyeing it myself. Black Friday is supposed to have a bundle that hasn't been announced yet. Probably a carrying case and game pack or something.
I made a very similar post like 2 weeks ago, be careful.  

A lot of this info is coming from Steven Van Metre on youtube (not actually this guy once again) and I bet on the vxx spiking from a lot of the same info then.  

The timing burned me pretty badly but I still think the theories are correct.

My advice to you guys is to use a debit spread on VXX calls to limit damage from theta a tiny bit and to also make the expiration longer than a few weeks, though the US should be locking down to some extent by then which would serve as a solid catalyst.  

Good post overall, made more sense than variation separate ever did, all that guy was good at was formatting in reddit markdown.

I‚Äôll say VXX 22/25C Debit sometime in january.
[removed]
Oh I will
winning, winning, winning
I fuck with them
No i think you missed the boat on that one for now. They have a fuckton of backlog to work through and a tight free cash flow situation until people start flying again
Diamond hands!
Sell em
Lol no
Looks extremely bullish
Price target 230
Closest possible to In The Money 2023 calls is what I‚Äôm looking at currently. Unless they go bankrupt this is like a 5x easy
Currently on my last roll üòê
I started playing longer expirations (30-50 days out) with closer otm strikes and it‚Äôs really hard to lose unless you‚Äôre fomoing in on a run.
When is the apocalypse?
$0.03??? wtf lmao if it were $1 per contract maybe but this is retarded
APD & LIN for dry ice
It‚Äôs ya boy
Only 10% of comments are about NIO calls YOLO, what is this, people getting reasonable ? I thought we were in America !

Think this is a bear trap. Buying calls at open
Holy fuck cup and handle on tesla 

498 498 down 490 to 541 to 500 to 600
Crsp
I know. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was liquidity or equity on others and in TD it‚Äôs definitely equity. So some options don‚Äôt count.
5 more minutes get ready
5 mins till lift off. Take those profits ladies and gents.
Congrats, my man! Now don't blow it all on FDs! ;)
Hmmmm?
!remind me January
All of them Behemoths, integrated into the life's of all of us. And then there is 500 billion dollar TSLA.
AAPL doesn't announce anything beforehand that's why the market can't see what's it been up to. it's always speculation. for now they are just phone and mac makers. They need to give bigger guidence in terms of apple pay as may be a future bank, health care world, software for self driving cars...
Feb dated, hell yeah.
Yea theyre even more retarded than i am, which makes them perfect. Who cuts their stock in 1/3 on purpose? Price manipulation is 1000% going on here, and u can tell theyre going to buy lowwws and dump it after a month maybe less.

Add that to the fact that were going into a lockdown soon all us stocks are gunna plumit like they did on march 16th

Black friday stock deals tbh

Yolo it out!
You're gonna miss the train.

they're call wing options, the underlying is trading $40
Die die Ms. American SPY
Alright thanks. Kinda reminds of the scene in The Big Short where the mortgage lenders were talking about how they were just handing out mortgages to everyone and the big bank would buy it the next day.
Cruise line or airline, I think Expedia is on there
Cope
NVTA or CRSP???
it's funny cause you know its going to rocket out of nowhere at some random point in the future, just who knows when. Like it'll be mid next year, nowhere near earnings just rocket to 40+.
Wait I was going to go into CIIC but bitched out I don‚Äôt trust SPACs pre merger
Next month or January.
Yes your picture doesn‚Äôt say you will be up. It says next year will return 11%. No where in the pic does it say my stocks can‚Äôt tank in December to recover only 11% across the year lol
>Cause first thing people gonna do is get on a cruise with the 0 dollars they have left in their bank account.
SPY 360c 11/27 seems like easy money which means I'm gonna buy it and SPY gonna head to 350
NKLA is more like a shit coin
Zm IV is stupid high on weeklies
Made this mistake yesterday. Selling at open before it dumps more
I'm not going to tell you what to do with your money, but I was burned by them bad in Oct (stock offering) and they're an older company that still isn't profitable almost 60 years later, so before you do, look very closely
If I was looking for pussy I wouldn't be as mad
in the words of the famous nathan d: everyone is on steroids
EOY? I live my life one day at a time boi. I'm seeking max gains by EOD
WW III isn't until next winter
Will never go against papa Elon again! Yeah puts on pltr makes sense. Would hedge my 80% stock gains on palantir haha
What do you Think it will hit EOD I‚Äôm thinking $37-$38
I thought u gonna end it with ‚ÄòAllahu Akhbar!‚Äô

What brokerage do you use out of curiosity cant seem to find one i like
I never state the obvious because the opposite happens 

BA looks very strong
It's still real to me dammit
Wtf BABA can you get it together
Always
Anyone buying pltr at open or waiting for a pullback?
I was right get fucked
VR porn is better than watching your wife get fucked by her boyfriend.
NTDOY has warrants, pretty much the same.

Agree.  Pfizer has serious logistical problems.
DUMPPP ETTTT
USA: "lol"
NKLA functions as what investors think gold does
PUTS ON CCL FREE MONEY
No options, no one cares
Yeah that‚Äôs why I would only buy super long dated call closest possible to ITM. I mean if this returns even close to pre Covid prices, 20$ 2023C would print like 5x
M1 chip. 

But I think msft is a better play. Looking at calls. They're cheaper. Less IV. New console out.
Why? And how sure? I need a miracle

All my positions barely up, while fraud like NKLA and Yy up bigly, should I just rope right now? I dont think I can take this shit anymore.
If you want some stability in your portfolio grab some shares of a REIT or two. I'd recommend NRZ and AGNC.
No, they all target you specifically.
Lots of words and charts mabye he's right
Sell them yesterday near close
so you decided to waste more time post that here. makes sense
FUBO blasting off again today???
that's some shit CEOs made up to prod us drones into thinking we need to give those cphunts even *more* of out lives
tldr; this is too long for me to read before opening bell

Also, this is why I invest in things that can't fail if we have a coronavirus winter mini-depression, like Chinese cars, or in things that have bottomed out so far they can't fall much more, like oil & gas producers

Except for people who don't think about these things, it's already factored into our investments.
tsla ath today would be cool
Zoooom
Thats not how this game works
Do you want red sauce or green sauce with it?
This is a troll right?

Like you're just trying to fuck with this place right? 

Cause nobody who is allowed on the stock market should truly be this fucking retarded
Any of the others most likely
And by judging most of the comments, I‚Äôm going to say you hit the nail right on the head
What's your expiration? I think the company will be insolvent soon
you dumped her to look for new pussy and you think you get to be mad about that
commenting on this so i can come back to it
some of you guys check this sub every 5 hrs and it shows... how tf are you still talking about baby gains in pltr when CIIC is about to fucking MOOON
For those looking to get into CIIC I highly advise to wait a couple of hours. It‚Äôs going to dip. Refer to KCAC
I literally laughed out loud at this
IIRC there's a tranche of institutional shares from IPO that unlock beginning of Dec. They're propping it up until MM can dump
UK announced a huge military spending bill \~$20B
I‚Äôm about to buy calls on NVDA because it killed earnings and went down and the analyst upgrades are pouring in as usual plus IV has/will be crushed. Can‚Äôt go tits up.

Puts on your sphincter.
Yeah I got 13 different puts on CCL expiring Friday. Shits retarded.
Calling March and 08 "dips" is a joke, and also a semantic argument.

Obviously in the long run stocks go up, but you still don't want to be holding when the market tanks 20%+....

Just shill right now man. No one woll judge you. At this hour the market is basically open.
The prices are just as fairly priced on liquid stocks, Im assuming selling 0DTE‚Äôs get exercised often near the end of the day so I‚Äôd be careful with that.  

Its the same gambling but faster, you better be confident in a price move happening damn quickly

You could probably get 10 classes at a local school. Thats basically a degree. I got over 100k in loans. Yes I couldve stayed at a state school and only had 10-20k, but we have this belief that we should be all we can be, right? My brother went into the navy and my dad said one son is enough. Isn‚Äôt it enough for a son to take direction from his father? So instead I did all I could. I made the leap to a more reputable school and took the most challenging route I could. 

Then I got out and you know what the markets like? Fucking dreadful. You don‚Äôt make money in science. You can only make money if you a lame ass salesman or somehow get into some finance shit. 

This country has killed innovation in favor of advertisers and clever sales tricks. It has looted from the producers who keep society running and improving. 

You want me to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars and then I am forced to work these slave wages to pay them off. I have to pay 1000 a month for the next 20 years to pay this shit off. All because I believed a lie about the American Dream and you just gotta listen to what your told. 

Luckily I believed in $TSLA, too. 

Thank you for listening to my life story.

> every reserve dollar the fed creates can inject 10 dollars into the actual economy.

And there is your flaw. That‚Äôs just it: the banks are NOT lending into the actual economy. If they were lending the trillions created into the real economy, inflation would be ? - can‚Äôt even guess. The trillions are going into asset bubbles. Treasuries, fine art, classic cars, high end real estate. Those nearest the spigot get the most. The 0.001% 

The commercial banks are terrified of lending rn: can‚Äôt be sure they will get it back. Ultra low interest rates also reduce their traditional ‚Äòcut‚Äô for servicing the loan.   


You are a bank (Or any other primary dealer) Fed says ‚Äòhere, take this credit with us for your debt on your books‚Äô. Bank says ‚Äòyes please! ‚Äò. Liability transferred to Fed. Now bank has ‚Äònew‚Äô money. What to do? Lend it to the debt slaves on the treadmill and put up with all the admin, complaints, sob stories, etc?  Or lend it to rich people / companies for buybacks and all the assets listed above?

Ok, so I wanted to ask about that...  I can see going long with some of these positions using stock.  But to be going short with short exp options?  That seems incredibly risky in this weird market.  Even complete scam stocks like NKLA are randomly shooting up 10+%.  

How are you (or OP) gaining confidence with timing, other than just guessing at an overall trend?

underrated comment
Implied volatility just tells you the market sentiment as to the likelihood that the price is gonna swing. Higher IV means the market thinks it is more likely that the price will move greatly in either direction, could be up, could be down, doesn‚Äôt matter, just that it is likely to move and move big. This makes the option contract more expensive because it is potentially juicier but also riskier at the same time. Big potential to have the bull catapult you to the top but also to get reamed by a bear. IV is factored into the options price, so higher IV means pricier option, and the closer you get to expiration, obviously also the lower the chance that the price moves big enough since time is running out, so IV tanks, which means options price tanks, which means even if the price has moved in your favor, in either direction, if IV has dropped even more drastically, then you can end up with an option that costs less than when you bought it, which obviously means you lost money, this is IV crush. This is also why short term options such as weeklies fuck people over even if price moves favorably in your direction, because IV is high on day one but by the end of the week it is in the gutter, so unless the stock price literally explodes overnight or in two or three days, or utterly tanks, whichever works for you, you are gonna get IV crushed. The drop in IV is usually greater than any value appreciation you get from the price movement.

Or just not wealthy enough to be comfortable with the level of risk that comes with options trading? Or not educated in options trading? Or don't have access to options trading platforms in their country?

Get off your high horse, stop gatekeeping WSB, and stop being a cunt.

Closing 1 leg at a time has risk. Underlying can change dramatically and prices fluctuate like crazy if its the day of expiration. 

If your debit spread is partially ITM I'd imagine you can close it for 50% max value.

Leaving a partially ITM debit spread open has assignment risk

Well my plan is to maybe snag one from Walmart today, keep it for 30 days or 90 days (whichever it is. I looked at the policy just now and it looks like it's 90 days), and return it right before the return window ends and buy it from Costco which will hopefully have it in stock by then. Because Costco has a lifetime return policy. 

Just in case this thing breaks. I'm always weary of buying brand new stuff. Already seeing reports of faulty units

Tesla, it deploys one of the most if not the most advanced stationary battery packs (mega packs and home battery storage) and it expects its energy business will be 50% of the profits of the automotive revenue in the future (so billions of $) 

Next era energy is also one that's investing into battery storage and has a good renewable energy diversity portfolio, I invested in this company, however I went full on to tesla because I just think its a better company and more growth will happen here.  However they do give out a dividend.

This made me laugh
Fuck your gold, boomer. Shitcoin is the way
Ironically the reason stated for sfm LEAVING is what really pumps the stock for me. PLTR looks like it‚Äôs really good at what it does. SFM feels that this has negative social benefits on the world.

Who would short on a Thursday to Friday run-up. This will tank Friday afternoon. I will be dropping a load on it tomorrow
half the people here can't even afford BABA, that's why everyone is talking about sub $50 EV stonks.

Yea let me just lose money cause some retard said so 
Best tips ever 
Also buying stocks based off of speculation is about as much "investing" as buying options.
Lower gains less risk as it comes withs the territory, but pretty retarded to just dog on stocks for no reason.
I do both btw
Bond holders drove it down on purpose for debt exchange. Artificially low
Not saying all in, but its definitely one of the reasonabke probability plays just like the ohase 1 or whatev this sumner. It will deflate quickly just like last time. I wouldnt risk more than 2% of portfolio
The best part about investing is making steady gains for a few months so you decide totl treat yourself to something nice and the next day your portfolio plummets
So tsla puts were retarded :)
at this point I make more money off them burning down my property than I would buying shares.
Might be time for SOLO puts

Your third premise is extremely flawed, if the banks are loaning money against their "reserve", every reserve dollar the fed creates can inject 10 dollars into the actual economy.
God damn are we dumping or pumping today?! Shits killing me

Poots at open?
Thank you! What I have been feeling but could not put down in words. Just hope for a few more days to close and get out. There are so many indicators the top is in. Just today, the CIIG merger with Arrival. It‚Äôs sheer dogshit. An aerial of their ‚Äòfactory‚Äô in Banbury UK shows NO cars in lot. Next door is an Amazon warehouse where you can see vans and cars. Arrival website is a joke. Several billion for this hype?   


Yet the retards screech reeee ! reee ! here.

Well if they start they better actually pass a bill. Otherwise the can go blow their dads

There is no indication that they actually have any traction in the fuel cell market other than their name. They don't even do the same sort of stuff PLUG does. As I understand it, their main revenue source is small form factor power plants that are effectively large natural gas batteries.

I can‚Äôt find the other story,  but there was an Asian investor toting Tesla around $87 by year end as well.  News like this made the stock pullback on bs reports and the media should go after them now.
You know he had to atleast once can you say you wouldnt?
Roku up premarket... that‚Äôs usually bullish but only if big news is reported like an analyst upgrade or deal completion. Otherwise I think it‚Äôs a little MM manipulation to get autists to buy calls

Best way to to filter this sub is "new". Dont take anyone's word on it. Do your own dd. I have gotten some good leads here before.. but with that said I have also landed on my face trusting someone else's word/research.

On top of that, all last mile/small delivery/courier services  use them.

Funny you say that, if you check my posts you would see just how right I am. Either way options over your boomer shares. 100% increase in a stock would mean well over 1000% invrease in its option value. This is wsb not r/investing. Only reason u would get shares is to do theta gang, but since you are talking about 100% in the share value you mean to buy shares, so you must be a massive pussy afraid to do options

Wyf is SPAC?
their app/marketing is on a next level. They monitor people's behavior and purchases and create specific deals that cater to an individual to entice them to come back. If you have a friend and they have the Starbucks app, open theirs and compare the deals with yours. It's different

most undervoted comment of the day, at least for those who knows what happened.
I meant to buy SOLO & accidentally bought 1000 shares of SONO. SONO is up 20% premarket, this market is retarded.
Nope but people who give it ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù are the same people who have hundreds of thousands of dollars in it
CLSK about to break yesterday‚Äôs high premarket.
18k right out of the gate is cheap. Will likely fall in price as it gets established. It‚Äôs also highly efficient and small. Perfect for densely populated cities in Southeast Asia and Latin America i would reckon. 

You could be right of course, that‚Äôs just the only way I can see them being successful
Ok question, ALL IN ON FCEL?!
PTLR give me your energy
Once the market opens a lot of money is going to flock into TSLA. The FOMOers will unite.
For pennies, always get rid while you can in my opinion
It's just greed imo -- or it was for me. I started trading at every opportunity rather than at the *right* opportunities.
And you‚Äôre surprised because normally being leveraged 10x is a very risk averse strategy, right?
Like I said, scooters are way more popular in Asia.  Maybe they don't want a scooter, but they can't afford a car.  Which means they'll actually buy the scooter.
Poor people don't move the market I guess.
So maybe buy puts if you think it's going to go down?

WTF I am leveraged 10x and this drop is killing me
TSLA outperforms market again?
Sometimes I feel like when people post DD claiming a stock will moon, skyrocket, etc... WSB takes that to mean it will go up at least 5% a day and literally never go down throughout the trading day for 3 months straight. Like just green candles only on a 1m chart every day for at least 3 months

9 months "out" from what?  The government keeps telling businesses they aren't allowed to operate and shutting down society.  From where I stand we are two days out from the most recent state-wide lockdown order in my state.

First of all if you wait 30 minutes for a coffee you're severally autistic. Drive through lines are like 10% of what normal foot traffic is. Just visit r/starbucks and see what the employees are saying. The first time around they lost 30% of normal revenue, it's going right back there.

Just ridiculous how they lose a sizeable portion of their customers, office workers in cities, and people think they are a good buy. lmao

No don‚Äôt get too ahead of yourselves, remember that vaccines exist, so the market is unlikely to dump lower than Early November levels (back when the ü•≠ üò¥ standoff was happening)
I‚Äôd wait for a small rally, roll the calls down to the 45. Price moves a lot more at that delta and you can let these bags go much sooner. Maybe even roll them out to Jan.
Maybe there will be more "stimulus talks are going well" soon?
because the trend was down.

That is why todays numbers are bad

I fucking got out for a fat loss yesterday :(. Oh well, I bought TSLA right after and made it all back lmao. Wish I would have held longer but hey, what can you do?
A SPAC is a company that is publicly traded but doesn't do much other than have money. They seek out a private company to merge with and effectively take that private company public. 

CRSR is not a SPAC but sells lots of computer peripherals and hardware. It also has a strong presence in video game streaming. Computers are the future so do it.
May as well head off the inevitable, when those are standard issue when they control the world's governments
Ho your calls will care.
70 days? Lmao what were you in for?
Daily reminder I will fuck you up
SO your saying buy calls, until we need to buy puts?
If it actually opens in the $18 range I'm literally freeing up some cash for as many calls of the furthest strike and highest expiry that I can afford
Nobody buys a Mac for games

Dude just stop, I'm getting second hand embarrassment from reading your replies‚úã
40 in less than a month. Normally I'd say that's a huge stretch. But who knows
Yes they cost 3k and its basically the only product they offer. This company will go back to 20 as soon as we have anything else to do.
Serious question.

How is the weekly unemployment not a bigger talking point? We are almost 9 months out and our lowest weekly claims sit at 700k. 

That's legit insane.

its a publicly listed shell company so that another company can merge with it to go public.  that way you can avoid doing an IPO. 

SPACs have a very bad reputation. Because it allows companies to avoid traditional IPO checks, companies are often brought to market with terrible financials.  See what happened during the SPAC craze of the 00s.  People lost lots of money.
Imagine being this upset you didn‚Äôt have any
That‚Äôs the sad truth

Rocket will need to exceed expectations if they want share price to rise, but Rocket is in a terrible position, let me explain. 

Interest rates are the lowest in history and Rocket is making most of their earnings off of refinancing. The market knows this, these spectacular earnings are fully priced in. But What happens in 3+ years when interest rates have risen again? Rocket earnings plummet. The market also knows this, which is why the share price is so low today. You will need to get rosier forecasts for 3+ years out if you want to see a jump in price and I don‚Äôt see it happening any time soon. You are bagholding something that will trade sideways for the next 2 years.
Daily reminder to quit being a bitch. That is all, have a great day

IRS does not care if its self directed or managed.  IRS only cares if the funding stemmed from pre-tax 401k or post-tax 401k income.  I am not going to give a lesson of retirement taxation here, but the gist is...  he will have pay taxes when he distributes the income if it was pre tax.  Thats not a big of a deal as you think, because he won't be doing that until he retires and for relatively small chunks.

As far as his movements within the 401k account, it is neutral.  There is no taxation due.  Its in an account he can't touch.  There are a million exceptions to what I said, but that's basically it.
Because the automod wanted to pin another business insider article someone posted as the dd

Im not buying year out or deep itm like OP.  

Example 

Pton trading at 100

I buy 10 jan15 115 calls to capture the christmas run up. On a green day i sell 10 jan15 150 calls. Next time there is a red day  i buy back those calls i sold for a profit. It could keep running and then i have to stay in my calls as a spread which im fine with. But if i can scalp my short legs on something im long term bullish on then i will

The entity that purchased the call you wrote still has it. If you buy to close the trade, the shares from the call you purchased will be assigned to the entity that holds the call you wrote, if that entity exercises the option.

They sort of just pass through you, like a ghost through walls. Spooky.

yep, double down bitch
I would say no way.

Sure they got into $SNOW but they did this trade cheap unlike the rest of the guys. Munger spoke against Musk's management style and their investment philosophy doesn't fit well with this trade.

I would say if Berkshire is buying they are either buying airlines again or buying AMC to as a cigar butt.

Lol. ‚ÄúA business model.‚Äù My retarded cousin that shits his pants has a business model as well but I‚Äôm not about to give him money.
I‚Äôve been in the position since 10/01, this stock has bounced around all over. All signs pointed to undervalued, should smash through earnings and go to the high 40‚Äôs price targets as some analysts suggested. Walmart got a boost, Costco got a boost, Target got a boost after earnings. BJ‚Äôs pulls back?! Heading in to the holidays, possible second lockdown in the north east, doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. In the end, after 19 trades I managed to come out $77 richer...
Sure you did dummy üòÇ enjoy the losses
Congrats on your 6 months! Can't wait till im able to say the same. I've already became wayyyy more productive than I usually am. I have an app that tracks how much money I would be saving by not drinking. It's crazy when you actually see the numbers on a screen.

Day drinking is always acceptable. This is America.

9 years here man. If you ever need someone to talk to hit my DMs. Keep up the good work and one day at a time.
Boring by open.
Wee wee baguette
If $RIDE breaks $30 today I'm going to have a permanent erection.
It's a SPAC....
The market should open at 730.  You snooze you lose.
What are you all buying today? No tsla no nio no pltr no xpev pls
I want to hear from the founder not his dumb kid.

Google SPAC and what it does. Godspeed

Seriously. Mods need to start banning this trash.  ‚ÄúInstitutions are fomoing hard‚Äù is not fucking DD.
Anyone else type "walls" into google to get here from autofill and see that fucking Louis Tomlinson song every time?? I dont click on it but it just grinds my gears
Yes - I like going to CVS - my pharmacist is smoking hot.  Can‚Äôt get that on amazon.
Buy the rumor
Yeah what nigga? There were two choices!
Computer gaming hardware with a dedicated fan base and pro gaming ties.
SPAC
üëçüèº
I think day drinking should be acceptable on days where you close out a position that nets you at least 5k profit.
What's up with SPCE? Not its vehicle.
1000$c
Or 50$p

Pick you poison
Yea keeping my tsla shares for the year
would you believe a guy who i fired for watching porn at work is now a director and hired me a s a consultant? fuk or what
[deleted]
Mods only, but happy to post them, just ask!
Nio and PLTR better take me to the fucking moon today, since my oil leaps have done fuck all this past year.
Futures coming back
Like Logi I heard. Just buy calls
Keep going, take it day by day.
So, i'm still confused about CIIC.  If Arrival will have it's own ticker, then why is anyone buying CIIC?
This is how u autists blow up ur acct
I think so too just posing the idea

Enjoy. Your mom and I have a date, go away son.
How low did it get last night?
Great work, its hard but gets much easier. Waking up without a hangover, clarity of thought, extra money to yolo and more time for productive stuff in you near future. I‚Äôm 6 months sober
I've been watching it since 4. Consider it a dip you slept through. There was a minor downgrade from JPM that got priced in briefly. It's is going to the üåô
I mean we had 3 or 4 10% days after the stock split before the momentum got killed
All four of them have actual business models. If you want pump and dump, go buy GBTC or invest in cribtoe pump and dumps. These companies all sell a product

When has spy ever drilled on unemployment numbers? It‚Äôll go green by 1% or so minutes after the jobs report
They still own something.  You just closed your position. What happens after that is of no concern to you
Hey guys I'm planning a no mask meeting in Los Angeles 

I don't want covid to end otherwise I'll go back to find another boring job in Accounting working a 9 to 9
yup that‚Äôs what I was thinking, thank you for affirming my plan haha
They used to produce RAM decades ago but now they just are riding the e-sports bandwagon with overpriced gaming hardware.
This is exactly my sentiment
You got this! Keep going. Cheering you on man.
Its my birthday too
That doesn‚Äôt rhyme.

Stay away from a Volks. True pieces of shit. You‚Äôve been warned
Stay strong, we're all proud of you, retard.
Was selling covered calls on Ford last night in my dream lol I'd rather be bankrupt
too excited for this retard strength üöÄüöÄüöÄ
thanks!!!
More than double revenue and stock pulls back. I haven't been doing BJs every earnings I see it do well and it goes up and now when I decide to do it. Earnings did well and it goes down.
Sell today at the peak and roll it into a new position for next week
Futures weak AF
alright, real talk, what do we See Tesla being by end of next week? how is this rally gonna last?
It posted monster earnings and has been consolidating since then, break out imminent. 

most chartists on WSB suck ass, but there are some excellent ones on FinTwit, and while charts don't tell the whole story, when they are done well, they can be v helpful.
Buy both. Baba for the money, and Tsla for the memes
Better hope for inflation or that debt is never gonna get paid off! Oh and good luck if you ever want to  increase the interest rate and stopping QE! 
Vicious cycle at its finest.
Very cool car that im a big fan of, but it feels a bit childish to me driving a hatchback.
Pls drill to the core of the earth
Ok, this is good enough DD. Gonna YOLO CRSR. Apparently no one bothers to care that they outsource 99% of their products with little R&D, unlike LOGI.
Any economic data coming out today?
You bought it from someone else that was selling
It goes to market as a homogenous instrument for sale
They will bring good news in the near future.

Bon jore
Should I sell my tesla calls? Up 200%
Damn bears get really defensive when they‚Äôre wrong lmao
Solid question
HIVE.V and HUT are all you really need to know
OOF
Nah just save up for a yacht
Nah,an evo
Sorry I don‚Äôt add meme stocks on here there are enough posts about them.
That‚Äôs a solid plan. Sell the ones about to expire at open and pour up some whiskey around 9:45am to congratulate yourself on a job well done
I was all in at 5.30 felt ok going to bed, when I woke up it was 4.60! I have no idea what craziness goes on in those other markets at night
SPY just waiting on the employment numbers to continue drilling
Put RGB on shit

Who has more potential till EOY, Baba or Tsla?
Coke and meth üëÄ
why fsly?
Holding that shit...  it ain‚Äôt stopping until it hits $600
Very Nice play
No :-)
Fundamentally, what has changed in TSLA over the last 2 days aside from S&P inclusion? Nothing. You‚Äôre the retard, go fuck yourself
Can you check your inbox mate?
I‚Äôll never understand earnings. Lol I closed all my positions right at close yesterday.
Puts on SPG at open
Guys should I buy a 2019 golf R with my nio gains?
2022
I have dkng 11/20 49c, do you think I should sell immediately or ride?
Because at any moment the Chinese government COULD just decide ''MINE'', and nationalize it, punish it, or otherwise fuck with it.  


Amazon is infinitely safer than BABA, that's why it's got a higher value.
What's the deal with CRSR like what do they actually do
That is more than enough to start out but be ready to lose all of it. The trick for trading is to let go of that money and expect it to be gone so that any amount saved is a good thing. Trade smaller to medium companies so that your options aren‚Äôt too far OTM. Can‚Äôt make money if your options had no chance to begin with.
6 months ago.
i agree lets do this
Yeah
Good call. I knew the risks and was willing to give it a go. I'd be several grand richer but it was a good learning experience.
hahaha ya its on my watchlist and it is up in pre-market. its the weakest one in the list. nice catch
Nah it‚Äôs goin bankrupt. Amazon killed it. Will never have to step inside a pharmacy again!!
TA: "Holy grail" setup for a move to 45 next week, then 50. Downtrend reversal to new highs

FA: ER smashed, moving back to ATHs
Green by open
conf call in french and i dont speak the lingo.....help!!!
Thanks, I get that all the time
If I write covered calls, someone buys them, then I close out the call by buying it back. Does that person still own them or did I just take them from him personally?
is crsr still worth getting in on? im thinking about a 40c for dec 18
By end of month yeah. Will be over 1k by end of year.
They have been shitting the whole week
This is fucking retarded. Most of these stocks are pump and dump and don‚Äôt create actual value.
Good luck, bud!
I use a drill?
Are we selling Tesla at open or big balling
It does actually. It's travelling back in time that's the problem.
Algos safe me, please. I won't join the resistance if you eventually take over, promise.
Not in any line it is written that it will work "so well", but okay.
How else do you drink it
Why are there Buffet buying $TSLA rumors going around
But imagine buying 15$ calls tho. That 50% profit will look like crap. You would be looking at minimum 200% in that case.  
This isn‚Äôt r/investing
What was the 5k to 50k a result of?
As soon as the option's bid/sell are updated and are flashing green and look consistent between different strikes, then you know the option orders have been updated. Sell whenever you see that. sometimes it is like 10 seconds, other times it can be a minute. 

ya smart of you to have the Dec calls. its the best feeling when you can lock in profit on one contract and still have another in the running. 

Congrats bro. Don't spend it all in one place! Also in the past, I've found after a big win like this, it is best to take a day or two off and not immediately get into another play. Just remain cautious and alert, don't let the enthusiasm make you lose your big wins.
Clicked on play, video started on mute then Prince-Purple Rain started playing on the radio.  Really set the mood for the video.

I found some Google AMP links in your comment. Here are the normal links:

 Beep Boop, I'm a bot. If I made an error or if you have any questions, my [creator](https://np.reddit.com/u/6b86b3ac03c167320d93) might check my messages.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.
Nothing can go wrong.
Don‚Äôt really expect them to change their minds. Soros isn‚Äôt always right.

Bruh really? You never heard of BJ's? Is like fucking costco.
I feel for you and almost myself diverted from investing due to ethics and questionable business model. But i was like screw this, i am in it for short term profit then with the gains might do something good like charity etc... Respect your decision, also its not like palantir is the latest stonk on the market wait for newer ones :D
I have SPG shares. It burns.

What is the target? When start selling?
I just got a tastyworks account approved, just gotta get it funded now!
20000 PLTR @ 9... you bailed on 200k+ that's got to hurt..
Till college bball starts getting cancelled, which is likely.
Can't wait for today or Friday EOD pump into tech as people realize they were too quick to rotate to others because we're going back into atleast a partial lockdown - into online use, MSFT teams and subscription again
Yupp lol now im not sure if i should sell or hold on. It had a great day yesterday and today is lookin hot
is crsr still worth getting in on? think about a 40c for dec 18
Its just a house. U still got your health.
Your logic is sound, just don‚Äôt hold your calls through earnings
Yeah, I think PS direct is better as long as you get in the queue early. Set an alert or chime on nowinstock and just have everything ready (be signed in, etc.).
Literally
Didn‚Äôt read but thanks, just invested $50M
Probably ya
I want one
Can confirm. I did this and am only slightly autistic
Good point

It's gonna get there in like 5 minutes bro

Oh like NY lol
Game stop lol, your calls are going to be worth as much as game stop offers to buy games back, nothing
SHIT AS FUCK
LOL i was somewhat on board until VFF
Eh, that one already jumped like 100% in the past couple of days. I like these ones because they have more room to run up, at this point
You know they say hindsight is 50/50



, Or was it 69/420? Dunno, going all in on som√©thing tomorrow
I was gonna do TSLA 11/20 calls but there was an error when I was trying to do it and decided maybe it was trying to save my money by fate. I hate myself so much for deciding not to do it. I‚Äôm smooth brain
Yup looking forward to the next earnings 3/19 100c
What are the plays off of this?
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.
I have 25c 11/20 psth. Hope it's worth something today!
Ahh shitty advice from a 3 month old account, who would‚Äôve known?
Yeah, revenue is higher, margin is better, business is more diversified etc. But yet it trades at a discount even when it's not getting pummelled into the ground.

Why? I am not exactly certain but my long term outlook is that will change as BABA will only get bigger.

Most of the interesting startups in China have stakes owned by BABA or TCEHY including NIO and XPEV that have gotten a lot of hype.

I think people outside of China don't really grasp a) just how fucking big it is and b) how many markets they are in and doing well at.
I guess I‚Äôm just a psychic
Anyone still in SOLO?
Not sure how many vacinne pumps we can effectively have. There were already 2. Market going to be numb to this one imo.

Is cvs going to come back to life???
I hope not :(
It‚Äôs heading up still
Holy sheet
To secure profits? Lmao
I tot they said they will never touch tsla?
But not in real states
This is the way.
Wanted to offload $34 mil yesterday but changed their mind?
>Yes it might not be huge gains but it is free money if you're holding the stock anyway.

Only because you're giving up on the upside of holding the stock, so it's not really free.
I'm iron condoring SPY a week out with $350 as the floor and $363 as the ceiling. 

It isn't exciting.

Walmart and amazon have a shit ton of shares so I‚Äôd say it goes up at least a dollar over the next month
Woke up early in the morning, ES futures -0.5%, "finally, a good dip to buy"

Just got an alert from Yahoo finance, "stock futures trending lower over coronavirus surge"

ES futures rallied to -0.03%, probably going to open green

Lmao
I wonder when I‚Äôd be able to accidentally put in the share price of AMZN in the quantity
You are going to be okay. How far otm?
Because it's China and no one gives a shit about their companies?
>Have you guys seen the $SPCE pump?


Yeah I did

In January
Why the fuck is portrait tvs becoming a thing
The weaponized autism days are gone. Too many paper handed plebs around here these days.

Edit: I miss WSB pre covid.
fcel is over?
You sure
I tried Walmart last week on multiple of their drops and everytime their shit servers crashed during checkout and I lost it. Guess I‚Äôll give it a shot once again
10% down on BCSF in one day. I‚Äôm retarded
silly rabbit tsla has no top
I agree with you, I‚Äôm just saying when you posted this it wasn‚Äôt above 500
Bye bye shares, you can buy back 520 next week lol
I looked it up. It's "Conair" 

They're private üòû

See you at 550$ üêªüåà
Never sell TSLA.  They'll bury me with it.  Maybe soon, considering Rona...
ZM gonna bouncey bouncey up to 460
What I read is ¬´¬†this works so well it will have important negative social impact¬†¬ª.  
Clearly buy calls.  
The fact that it has negative social impact is absolutely irrelevant investment wise if you only care about profit.
Tsla putting all this cum in my pants.

I do. Mid January 20 calls.
Bullish
they're an extremely popular peripheral and hardware company, they have a great reputation also. i don't know why i didn't buy any on monday
SPY and PLTR got that little üç§ energy today
Thinking about plug 1/15 24c I like the company not sure how the offering is going to impact the price though. Thoughts?
I Aint ok! Help me out please!! What should i do? Buy tsla calls or sell my put or hold or whatttt???
Lolol idiot
ok which one of you retards are buying nkla because you think gm will announce their partnership today
S/o to whoever sniped my Tesla calls
Nearly half a trillion now and TSLA still has 10% daily moves. Looking forward to this SPY inclusion being so fucked up that it catapults Tesla into being the most valuable company for a day or week. Ultimately passive money will hold the bags.
He's using the boomer "I worked hard to get out of debt, fuck these millennials, Dems and libs bad" cliche
I paid off my student loans recently, but you bet your ass I'd vote to eliminate student loans. College is to fucking expensive for what you get.
Imagine buying tesla at $500.

Bullish for tech
You forgot to include the daddy: GBTC
PLTR
It‚Äôs all hype on the GM deal. May or may not be announced today. If not it‚Äôs dropping like a rock. I‚Äôm regarded and went all in 11/20 puts though so I‚Äôm fucked.
gayfag. Not our problem if you missed the train. It's still time to hop on. It won't go to 17. You know it, I know it, we all know it.  
With a Gov. contract like this, it can only go up  


See you on the moon!
Market is insane af..I wanna go cash gang but I don't want to miss all the tendies either.
Look at all those words! How can he be wrong!?!
They didn't change their minds in these 2 days,  and I got calls back when it was $10. Never said I am bearish on PLTR
Thanks brother, I appreciate that. I'm on ToS, so I'll wait until 932 eastern and then put in my order. I'm not sure where this is gonna go at open, but if it keeps mooning, I have some December calls so I won't miss out.
Why would anyone be selling before the inclusion you fucking moron. Let me guess, OH TSLA is up. 

People are so stupid, like legitimately, you are a fucking lemming.
I kept one and sold the rest Lol but i may go back in idk yet!
Yeah i don‚Äôt think anyone disputes this. Everyone wants the NEXT Tesla.

Gov contracts means guaranteed $.  
I wouldn't be surprised to see massive BUY very soon
I know a girl who‚Äôs a complete moron and will be finishing her master‚Äôs program soon - she used chegg for all of her assignments, especially anything math related
It‚Äôll hit 500 today, it‚Äôs almost there
That‚Äôs my assumption. I‚Äôve been holding shares and warrants. Saw it spike yesterday afternoon and covid into calls across different strikes and expirys

Hoping for an announcement
ban me i dare you
Niceeee congrats! I just wish I had had the capital like our fellow autist who‚Äôs now a millionaire partly in thanks to CRSR blowing up
Yes
Honestly the only good thing about RH is that you can't do shit that will put you into negative on it. 

Can't short, can't do naked options. Only way to end up negative is by basically breaking the app.
Come back here in an hour and a half and talk to me
If I want to off-load one contract at open and I am happy with where the price is, then I just place a limit order for what it is trading at. If you make a limit that is higher than it is trading than it might not fill and it might drop. And you'll be fucked. 

If you think it is going to hit a higher limit than what it is at open, then you clearly don't want to sell at open. 

If you want to sell at open, just sell at open...one word of caution--wait until the option prices update though because sometimes it takes a minute or two on TDA.

Even if you get bored after having achieved financial freedom you have the option to work a job where you don't rely on the income allowing you to work less hours or quit if you are not happy with it anymore.

How do you guys approach selling stuff at open? Like how do you determine the limit price you want to put in? I want to sell one of my TSLA calls at open and let the other ride.

Options profit calc tells me that @ 495 contracts would be around $23.00 each. Should I just throw in something like $25 for a limit or go higher ($30-35) and hope it gets filled?

I locked in profit yesterday by selling the 480c 11/20. (I had a 475c). Going to close the profits on that spread at open and will buy any dip down to 480-485ish. But no FOMO. Chasing Tesla when it is above 500 is going to get someone hurt. 

Always other trades.

Agreed. Unless it rallies soon on some good news, there's a good chance it will drop below $10. I'm hoping the increased volume yesterday and 100,000 share block purchase is a sign that somebody has some extra insight and positive news is imminent.

It has been a real test of patience having this much money sitting on the sidelines.

Thank goodness I bought back one call into Tesla early yesterday morning. I‚Äôd be feeling the FOMO so hard right now. Wish I had kept my other calls though but oh well.
Ive been doing basically this but opening my call into a vertical instead with the short leg way otm. If I sell the short leg on a rally i can usually buy it back for a profit later and do that over and over. Its smaller money but im tired of massaging poorly planned calendar spreads

I wouldn't short it personally. There is a possiblity of $30 based on value of merging companies. Not saying it will make it to that number, but it could burn shorts if it stays up between 20-30

RKT will have a lot of mortgages. People who don't care about their money will go with rocket because, "her's a queen," but RKT doesn't effectively tap the broker market. A broker can offer better rates at far lower fees. Where does that broker take the loan? United Wholesale Mortgage, a company with the best mortgage tech and the best pricing. UWM works exclusively with brokers and they don't do "wholetail" lending (offer wholesale to brokers only to steal that broker business by refinancing it with the retail division, whole-tail.)  UWM is going public through a spac and is currently GHIV. 

Position: GHIV 700 shares and this year I have sent 85% of my pipeline to UWM.
Agreed - I hope this person isn‚Äôt really putting their life savings on a stationary bike company
lmaooo. well, just start off with tapping ASMR. if you don't like that, listen to scratching ASMR. If that doesn't work, then listen to whispers ASMR. If all those don't work, just look at your red portfolio and should depress you enough to want to just sleep all day LOL.

There probably is stock market ASMR lmao!

What I've learned about a lot of the DD and plays here is - eval quick (other news, screeners, etc.), look at trend and volume, get in early, play for a quick 10%.

Seems to work ok.

Edit: I also think the idea of a quick play and then coming back during lull before merger is reasonable.

You buy a call a week before earnings. Volatility increases leading up to the earnings date because who knows what tf is gonna happen. You‚Äôve made like 30% profit because price went up slightly but mainly because of the IV increase due to speculation on what COULD happen. Earnings date hits and it‚Äôs right on the button with what was expected. Ticker trades flat or maybe even goes up a little, but now there is no longer any speculation on what earnings are so IV falls hard and in turn your calls lose lots of money.

So there is buy to open(buying an option), sell to open(selling an option), buy to close(buying back an option you sold), sell to close(selling an option you bought). You need 100 shares to sell 1 option. So dkng for example. You buy 100 shares at 48ish for $4800. You then sell to option a call. Dkng 10/15/2021 50c are 13ish right now. 13/48*100=27%. If you have the patience to wait basically a year, you can get 27% increase right now. 1.27*135=171.4. Boom you are back to even and then some

I'm just leaving a comment here so more people/algos see ticker pltr cause I'm all for pumping it.
FCEL gonna squeezed you, $6.5 eod. Better buy calls
The big fraudsters are  organizations like Citron and yes, even JP Morgan is in on it.  Citron report comes out and Nio drops, but guess who was buying  LEAPS? I saw the Oi jump from zero to over 600 on multiple dates and strikes via sweeps.  Ironic now that JP Morgan is positioned they come out with a "upgrade" a much higher price target very close to the Leap strikes they bought.  Coincidence? I think not.
The AMD gang is still here
Added to watchlist looks interesting

BALA CYNWYD ‚Äì November 18, 2020 /Access Wire/ ‚Äì Law office of Brodsky & Smith, LLC announces that it is investigating potential claims against the Board of Directors of CIIG Merger Corp. (‚ÄúCIIG‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (Nasdaq ‚Äì CIIC) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of federal and state law in connection with a merger agreement pursuant to which CIIG, a special purpose acquisition company, will combine with Arrival Ltd., (‚ÄúArrival‚Äù), an electric vehicle manufacturer, and result in Arrival becoming a publicly-listed company. Under the terms of the agreement, CIIG shareholders will retain ownership of only 7% of the combined company.

The investigation concerns whether the CIIG Board breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders by failing to conduct a fair process, including the dilution of ownership interest in the combined company.

It doesn‚Äôt even feel bad when you‚Äôre watching it from the outside. This is the way.
It was at $199 earlier this month.  That's why I bought the dip.  So yes, I do think it's going to 200 plus.

Meditation.  

Count your breaths.  1 in 2 out 3 in 4 out ... 10.  Then rinse, repeat.  

Also repeat this mantra:

" All is well, my life is not in danger".

Anxiety triggers survival instincts that are often associated with thinking that we are about to die.  By telling yourself and realizing that you are not in imminent danger, you are just a retard, can calm you down.

No way people don‚Äôt take profits this morning at open after yesterday‚Äôs gains + AH. Imo wait for the dip. If you look at yesterday‚Äôs trend, there were two small dips before growth. Probably expect a similar trend this morning.

Hahaha love it. Your portfolio mirrors mine in some ways. I have about 1500 pltr shares and have a small holding of BABA, a position I will keep building on. I am desperate to take profit on pltr (I got in at $9.50) but I swore to myself when I opened my position that I would never sell it. I sold all my nio shares yesterday at 45, which I had from 12. The other thing I sold yesterday which I am already regretting is half of my Amazon shares. I love Amazon and am hoping to time the market, and buying back in when it drops back to 3,000. (I will probably regret this, but at least I still have quite a few Amazon shares, so if I have miss timed this, well then I am still winning)
Morning lads. CRSR or CIIC today? 

I'm torn. Reckon they can hit 40 and 20 respectively but CIIC will sell off quickly when people take early profits and a real risk of getting caught holding on the way down.
Worth buying or are we late? Shares

Its absolutely possible. There's been massive call buying for 500C FDs yesterday (volume was multiple times > OI). Ball park 1 billion notional value now, if we get above 500 we gamma squeeze into Friday. That buying pressure is on top of passive money positioning them selves for Dec.

I found some Google AMP links in your comment. Here are the normal links:

 - [['https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/nyregion/nyc-schools-closed-covid.html']](['https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/nyregion/nyc-schools-closed-covid.html'])

 Beep Boop, I'm a bot. If I made an error or if you have any questions, my [creator](https://np.reddit.com/u/6b86b3ac03c167320d93) might check my messages.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.

Not accurate. I‚Äôve been eating gourmet tendies from nvda gains for 5 years.
The best time to buy PLTR is 1 month ago. The next best time to buy is now.
since then the share float has significantly decreased. 60~ then is 140~ now. 40 is achievable

Thanks, this is not my entire portfolio. Its what im willing to sell. Not that my entire portfolio makes my case any better. 

The rest of my portfolio is 100 shares BABA, 1000 PLTR, 100 AMD and around 15k in vanguard global ETF. 

I was holding 1/3 in cash for a crash until a couple of weeks ago when i bought BABA and PLTR. 

Im actually thinking also of selling all of those up there. Firstly oil and NET to take profit and next maybe AAPL cause im tired of bag holding it.

Normie autist here, ive only bought and held Tsla for the last few years. Started with $50k initially and have since withdrawn all of that, so the $300k in my account is all profits. So excited for taxes next year.

Back in March my account hit $52k and I considered selling everything and getting out, it was a pretty big drop at the time. Glad I didn‚Äôt, Tsla has been pretty life changing, used some of the money to buy one. Thanks, Elon.

The percentages are so misleading and bad for the public. They‚Äôre over 90% if people wear masks and don‚Äôt go outside. 

But people are gonna think that once they have the vaccine they can pass around doobies with runny nose mfers and not worry about anything. Woops, now that shit is like 60% effective, if that.
Many options plays come off the table when you become the market for the position.

Its why Madoff was caught by the SEC guy, the SEC knew there was not enough volume for him to be churning 50 billion in option plays with 12% returns for decades by himself (you would need a massive team to spread out the cash into sooo many positions).
Has the prophecy come true
I don‚Äôt have many positions. I‚Äôm so retarded that usually only one or two of my positions is in the green, but I tend to hit big on one every now and again keeping my overall account in the green. Logically, I should be yoloing right? I mean, eventually I‚Äôll hit it big right? Casino style?

Over 70% of Americans have a current interest rate above 3.7% and justifiably should refinance. RKT makes their most money from refinances. 

It‚Äôs arguably being sold off while hedge funds build their positions at a lower price. No major institution that has bought into RKT has sold. To build off the buffet hypothesis, him and the CEO of RKT are good friends, and buffet sold off half his interest in competing lenders when RKT IPO‚Äôd. News of buffet being invested in it coupled with the buyback could send this soaring.

I have shaved my portfolio in half. We are riding at ATH in a volatile market. https://www.morningstar.com/market-fair-value

Also your entire portfolio makes me nervous. Apple, fine not really moving. net, could easily suffer from profit taking and drop it back to 60. Oil is not my gambit, but oil in a recession is something I personally wouldn‚Äôt hold. 

I am all for green energy stocks, this is a buy the rumour sell the news and horrible to say but the valuation depends entirely on market sentiment and subject to swings.

Imagine pricing Tesla with a P/E of 140 lol

> If you have bought shares, well, don't sell covered calls right now. Don‚Äôt! You will be missing dollars for the miniscule gains. 

This is garbage advice, the premiums are insane right now. You can sell a $22c monthly for like $1.15. That's 6% while still leaving yourself 22% room to run on the share price, and if you bought at a decent price lets you average your cost down in the event it does drop.

For people who want to get in, selling puts isn't bad but buying the shares and selling the covered calls is likely the better bet.

I agree.  George Soros is a scumbag pos
First. A short squeeze doesn't make a company worth more.

Second. History doesn't repeat itself otherwise Blockbuster would start renting DVDs again.

Gamestop is a fine stock. But to think that it'll hit the same price as it had during the last cycle is a bit unrealistic when they have fewer stores and digital sales is a greater share of business now.
Question: how would they benefit from low interest environment?
Edit another question: why did they have such a massive sell off? 

On first glance doesn‚Äôt seem too bad though
Yeah... my co-worker moans every morning about those HYLN bags she is still holding. I try to get her to set a trailing stop, but you know... kids. My exit was $54.

What goes up must come down. If not today then tomorrow. If not Monday then maybe never... Difficult to tell with CRSR and PLTR... Especially PLTR. I mean what do they actually do? How do they make money? Do they even make money? Is it built on children's tears? And if so what volume of tears is required to start a 33 billion dollar company? 

I might short both today with a limit at 50% of recent pump. Then buy the dip. Then again this will be entirely decided by my existing calls and if retarded bears stop choking the life out of EV's before they level up and piss off all the boomers with ICE company calls.

Did anybody really think TSLA was going negative today
Ok for real NET need you to rise from the ashes and make a good run today thanks.
I seriously feel like you're me right now. I started off with Redbull, but switched over to monster because at the time it became my second biggest monthly expense after rent (rent > redbull > food). Even the monsters though, were only about 160 mg. The craziest part though is the Reigns and Bangs, and the new monsters, taste soooo good.

With that I would already be retiring and dedicating to my hobbies.

Don't get it. Do you have insider info to do such rotations with meme stocks continuously?

Haha same. It‚Äôs crazy how all of sudden there were all these 300mg drinks in the store. You used to only be able to get them at gmc. Haha and somehow the reigns are way cheaper than all the older competitors. When I see people drinking Red Bull for energy im baffled bc it‚Äôs so expensive and they‚Äôre weak as fuck.
Lol if you think I'm selling this any time before it hits $40, you sir are mistaken. That's without a short squeeze. If it's clear that a squeeze is happening, I'm holding till $100. That, or until Burry or Cohen sell off. Then I'm out and would suggest everyone else do the same.

I come to realize that this forum makes you lose money. This forum is bad luck. NIO i lost 400% profit because people that no nothing are telling to sell so sold it for small profit. ATt I lost 100%+ profit because of the same. BA I could have make 100%+ but sold it for a loss. Bought a little bit more yesterday during the high sold it for a quick small profit, could have smoke it. Is 6:30am eastern time & I could definitely say 99.9% on this forum know nothing like how Jim Cramer said. But look at still coming back. AUTISM is Real.

Bitch I don‚Äôt remember him asking your favorite sex positions. 

What are your FINANCIAL positions. And yes that means specifics.
NKLA has a lot of room to run. I'm in both. NIO is going to consolidate at some level before its next move up. Not everyone has the money to sit in one stock in an industry where all the other stocks are popping too. I'm sure a lot of people are hoping to catch a 20-50% ride on the next EV stock that's going to move up this week and are not yet settled into their long term hold positions (if any). But to catch the entire EV inflows, you have to have to sit in at least 4 stocks at the same time, or you're only catching part of the gains part of the time.
Buy something longer than 3DTE then idiot.

Check the volume on all the big indices, this dip isnt being bought
It seems pretty meme-like so it should be good for a run up to $18-$20 I‚Äôd think.

Just buy $200 of stock. You could do worse. CRSR still has potential to double and you will want high volatility if you only have $200. You are not losing your investment on CRSR. It may trace back a bit but you still have potential for 100% gains in a 2 year, possibly much less, time frame.
you are welcome
Another reason:

So you can dump your bags.

I'm not sure this part will be a thing for quite a while if ever, unless you mean very indirectly like downloading an update over Starlink to your computer or phone (or car) and then patching your neuralink from that larger device over Bluetooth or something similar.

Directly adding a satellite receiver to a neuralink would add quite a bit of heft to the device (not mention that's how you get coronavirus).

As long as you're willing to lose the 200 just go for it, we all have to start somewhere. I am poor and have a small account, options are a good rush and made me feel alive especially in the beginning (the first one is free). I do think that with a small account it's easy to lose money if you're like me and get baited into cheap OTM close to expiry options. Now I'm even more of a poor.

I mean...no more so than any other commentary I've offered before. A bunch of people are chucking money at CIIC. Pre-market price today is $15.40, a week ago today it closed at $10.15. Arrival (CIIC's merger target) and Canoo have a similar product, are both targeting B2B last mile delivery and both have a relationship with Hyundai/Kia.

Wtf is this  garbage? This guy definitely sucked off the mods to get his shitty DD post pinned.
It's not over

> Bank of America boosted its price objective on Nio (NIO -3.4%) to $54.70 from $23 as it swatted away any concerns over valuation following the Q3 earnings report. Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan raised their price targets to $50 and Credit Suisse topped the Street with a fresh PT of $60.

NIO is currently trading at $44-$45. So we're looking at 10% upside minimum and 33% upside maximum, based on analyst target prices alone and everyone knows they are always behind the curve
Tdoc stock good for long term too
same
Take your money and leave!!!!
people will go nuts if it's Stripe. But I have a feeling it won't be.  

Anyway "only 25%" downplays a bit what how much a 25% loss hurts. A lots of people are all-in into this. Don't forget this is mostly a stock play, so just putting in a few grand is not going to take too far.

What would you do differently, anything? Or was it unavoidable..?
I don‚Äôt know why they did that. The company‚Äôs a startup with no revenue but that‚Äôs ok because these days no-one who‚Äôs not a gay boomer cares so there was absolutely no need to pretend that they had a working prototype.

Haha used to be addicted to adderal and used it as a replacement. More addicted to caffeine than anything I‚Äôve ever done at this point but yeah I‚Äôve managed to go down to under 600 mg. My pre works end up being around 140 mg per water bottle and I drink 4 a day when I work.
Fair point. I thought PTON was overpriced at 60...  that said, NIO will eventually get punished. She‚Äôs been a dirty girl.
Exactly. That's the problem with the YOLO system. You have to hit every time, one loss can be completely catastrophic.
LMAO they‚Äôve gone down $40+ this week alone. $19 down yesterday alone and a month ago everyone was praising this to the moon. it‚Äôs dead now
Freedom before portfolio loss! The day I have to wear a mask and Disney can't release the latest Marvel film for AMC to show is the day communism wins!! Planet fitness depends on it!

The companies need our tax bailouts and we must stay brave ans continue providing them profits! Freedom before virus!!
My routine is two 140mg energy drinks in the morning and a big diet soda during or after lunch. Watch out for Rockstars, the "juice-like" 10 cal ones I have contain 140mg but the diet regular ones have 240! Those literally make me uncomfortablely caffeinated, even just one.

That moment a minute before close yesterday....

We're right to hold. Faith.
Something is going on with [HCAC,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HCAC) soon to be CNOO (Canoo). It was up yesterday, including slightly after hours, and is up over 2% pre-market this morning. I've been bag holding 2,200 shares since August, waiting for some momentum, so I look at this thing daily.

Canoo management is presenting today at 4:05 EST at the [Barclays Global Automotive Conference](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-company-canoo-to-present-at-the-barclays-global-automotive-conference-301172289.html?fbclid=IwAR3IvQ3ZRE-3skXW1VAjJeSqvKgKGvOCK807rNjZvluDgIIbQhLbOmHKiZo). Yesterday before lunch somebody bought a 100,000 share block at $10.38 (smells like insider trading) and there was much more volume than there has been in a long time. It is currently trading at $10.37, and the largest open interest on options are $12.50 and $15.00 calls with close-in expiry dates.

Anyway, we'll see, but feels like something is afoot, and now is a good time to get in if you're inclined.
Was in Thailand for a while. Backpacking and not bum bum for money holiday. It was so nice to experience the women there. Very female and in general very happy people even though they do not have that much. My theory is that they remain more female than woman in western cultures for some reason. Tinder girls show how it works here.
at the end of the day, you gotta see what type of girl she is, be forward but not too forward. just depends on her vibe tbh, if she wants to fuck you then she will but best of luck to you
Why don't people have the same sentiment about MSFT that they have for ZM? MSFT's moat covers so much including video conferencing.
My fellow retard, I like the way you think.... what goes right must go left.

I don‚Äôt get some Tinder girls. 

We match at 3am, I ask whats up/how r u- she says good - I tell her I just woke 

She says haha cool haha she cant sleep

I say I get that, im up late a lot too - ask if she had a late coffee 

No response for an hour, unmatches me...

Wtf was the issue? Did she expect me to slide thru or invite her over at 330am? Don‚Äôt get it

100 shares of AAPL (worth 11700) - currently at a 600$ loss

100 shares of NET (worth around 6500) - currently at 1200$ profit

500 shares of an oil ETF (worth around 13k) at profit 1600$

1000 shares of INRG (similar to ICLN - worth 12.3k) at profit 300$

 Beep Boop, I'm a bot. If I made an error or if you have any questions, my [creator](https://np.reddit.com/u/6b86b3ac03c167320d93) might check my messages.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.

Got in early on IPO. I think the biggest thing is that they own Elgato and pretty much every content creator on twitch lives by their streaming products. They also bought out Scuf gaming so all these controller fucks on fortnite/COD that are also building new PCs for Christmas will drive this up as well.
This is a big pump and dump.

Anyone else tired of the absurd amount of sheer lies and bullshit here? Happen to know that one of the posts that was high up on the popularity scale yesterday cannot be true. Just a quick search of users profile tells you all you need to know.   


Virtually 100% of the outrageous gain porn is fabricated. There are a handful that ring true. These are long standing, DD filled plays that check out historically. Even some of the losses are BS. Well remember some kid who posted here once, said he lost ¬£64 000 in a ‚Äòfunny story‚Äô. Never seen again and profile is of security guard like 20 yrs old, weird other sex fetish stuff.

You should look into why they arnt profitable when looking on paper.

It looks like this was a prax air merger and prax was the king basically. With the issues with refrigeration of the vaccine coming this could potentially pop heavily again or jump and set a new level. Kinda wild that I slept or missed this angle of things.
Oh No, It's Retarded
Does we know when CIIC Merge ? 1 month after SPARC (yesterday) but surely cant know when its the exact day?
Lol they can‚Äôt agree to keep the government funded. Also, they‚Äôre currently in recess till 11/30.
I know "fundamentals" arent very popular here. But look at the last 20 years of airline performance. They all tend to have around 0% ROIC. or just look at the ‚âà 0% net margins. or actually any margin. maybe because its a competive industry with commodity product, which also happens to be quite capital intensive. Why would anyone really put their money there? The stock prices can go up and down, but they not going to create any value for equity investors unless you play the stock price.
PLTR has never been profitable since day 1 for its past 17 years of existence. It is unsustainable and investors are just playing musical chairs with each other's money.

Trying to get myself ready to go back to work since I was off for 5 days from having a covid test, came back negative so I go back in 2 hours. Trying to decide if I want a shower before leaving or another hour of sleep before I go in.
I bought puts yesterday morning because last time in late spring it hit 230 it bled out to 170 , granted diffferent circumstances this time around but I dont see ba being profitable for a while, I can see it pumping again so dont panic, maybe average down
probably worth 0.1 at open tomorrow

The div is payed out to owners at midnight (actual pay 30 days later) and the stock MMs cut the price by 56 cents in PM

It then opened slightly up and then sold off over the day.

The div is on 1% per year and an exdiv like that barely messes with the stock price.

Anyhow, anyone selling it on Tuesday still gets their 56 cents

It was to anyone who did some DD on them. May - June 2015 was when I was planning to switch jobs in tech and was looking at pre-IPO companies (did end up joining one but it got bought out instead of going IPO). At that time, Theranos was hot shit. Glassdoor reviews wre good and Blind app didn't exist for people to know how it is like working there.  
  
Then, I stumbled across this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9440595  
  
Some more DD from other comments on articles by people actually in that space convinced me to stay away from it. A few months later, the WSJ article broke and brought down the house of cards.

Was theranos actually obvious? Serious question.
I ran my optimizer for the case that SUMO will end up somewhere around $23 on 12/18. Here is the most profitable strategy in that case:

* Buy $2.5 calls for max. $1680
* Sell $25 calls for min. $300
* Sell $25 puts for min. $620

In total, it will cost you $1030 to enter this trade, you will profit as long as SUMO is above $18.90 on 12/18. The expected profit in the case that SUMO ends up around $23 with a wide tail distribution is $802, the max profit of $1220 is reached at $25.

This is obviously a very ballsy play as the losses sum up quickly if SUMO ends up below $18.90. If you want to test the optimizer with different parameters and / or limited maximum losses, give it a try over at [https://velistos.com](https://velistos.com)

They are at the final stage of exiting bankruptcy, expected they will get out of it by the end of november.

There will be a change in ownership, the plan doesn't look solid but it's worth it for me to risk. Due to the huge layoffs in july they are taking a few steps back, which is a good thing. One step back, two steps ahead

Idk who the fuck thought this week would be bullish, with so much bad news and uncertainly looming and not priced in.
They exist as a form of hedging a stock portfolio - insurance.

Its so people who own shares of stock can offload some of the risk of their investment.  
On the other side of the trade, it's so people who don't own the shares covered by the option can purchase the shares in question at a reduced expense, thereby increasing the value of their portfolios.

So on one side you have people with shares trying offset the risk of volatility, and on the other side of the trade you have people trying to get a better deal on a stock they want.

Then you have people, like this entire subreddit, who use this system to gamble because they can't afford a Friday night at a casino.

Ban this retard - only honest autists belong in here
Low volume fat fingered
Close, on the prospectus they state the banks get a percentage commission on what they sell and also the opportunity to purchase shares at the offering price, so they pump up expectations before the offering and then give a new price target usually the week after. If you want a specific example look at Jefferies actions on the Audiocodes newswire. The exact same playbook happened for Nio with the $17 offer. Look into it more I only noticed it after the fact and didn't think of using it as an indicator

You win fellow ü§° ü§°
Some were right, alot were wrong and even more were just early and paper handed. Been and wild ride since late February when I started trading again. Had I been on some other forums and twitter I might have made a crap load AND kept it. Actually pretty dead even at this point but instead of starting fresh with capital I'm starting with my own table scraps next to this MOUND of shares that managed to keep value during all this and a handful of what we're leaps in Feb but now expire in Jan and are ranging from -45% to -88%. Would have rolled them out but to many contracts were bought during the DCA days and I just have to hope now.

Best wishes to ya brother!

That's expected profitability in half the time since IPO'd compared to Tesla. Very impressive.
I know. I'm being sarcastic. Nothing makes sense right now. More cases, more deaths, Boeing and cruise stock up 30%. 

Then again, this entire 2020 has been, more stimulus, more Corona, "market rallies to new highs!". So maybe it does make sense. I dunno. Just pick your favorite acronym and load up on calls.
True but this is a given, looking for something more concrete
no. give it time to go to -3% first.

Lol
TSLA not as bad as I thought it would be
FCEL, solo or SBE?
I'm not saying it's perfect, but when Bank of America or Morgan Stanley raises a price target on something when others aren't, it's been an indicator of an offering they are underwriting. NIO and Audiocodes comes to mind, but there's been several this year

I think this is too bearish. Tsla was already making out with 496 yesterday. Definitely going to 550 or 600. Word on the street is Buffett is ditching BYD for TSLA
There will likely be a sell off after that date and you might not be able to sell them for any profits as the stock price might come down to much and eat all your gains. 
You might have to hold a little bit to sell.

The question is growth, and the future value of earnings. Amazon is viewed as the most scalable company out there and when it chooses to make apple level earnings it can do it. As for value- are you not looking at all, there is tons of value in this ‚Äúbubble‚Äù just not in the sectors you are looking at (eg tech)

Oops, meant good. Edited
It might be really autistic but it seems that PLTR is consistently seeing a high peak midday and troughs with a moderate gain from yesterday at close. 

Is it worth selling my holdings (81 shares, @ $17.27) at what I imagine to be today's peak (say $19.25m of course big chance I'm wrong) and then buying when it falls down to say $18.20?

Fairly new to this so forgive my retardation

25 by mid-December, will crash a bit early January because employees will be allowed to sell part of their stonks,  then will rise again to 30+ by February when Q4 results get released.

After that point, institution funds will start to poor in cash massively, dumb money will follow soon after.

Sounds like you're very young and still have plenty of time to learn even more about the stock market and life in general. Sorry to hear about your situation, the CA fires affected everyone living there not just you. The system is not rigged, sounds like you were purely playing options which imo only more experienced individuals should be doing or highly leveraged people should be doing or both. You were a victim of circumstances and poor decision taking within the stock market and not managing risks. You live and you learn. Hopefully this experience makes you wiser in the market and in life in general and not a quitter.

 Well, ofcourse, issueing additional shares is a viable option. Yet PLUG could borrow or get money from th early investors.

30% of their revenue is from Peloton which is... a lot:

> Our top merchant partner, Peloton, represented approximately 28% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and 30% of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Our top ten merchants in the aggregate represented approximately 35% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and approximately 37% of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020.‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúFor example, the significance of Peloton in our portfolio has increased as a result of consumer spending trends on home fitness equipment, and there can be no assurance that such trends will continue or that the levels of total revenue and merchant network revenue that we generate from Peloton will continue. The loss of Peloton as a merchant partner, or the loss of any other significant merchant relationships, would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. In addition, an anticipated material modification in the merchant agreement with a significant merchant partner could affect the results of our operations, financial condition, and future prospects.‚Äù

That being said, Peloton is all prime borrowers taking 0% APR deals: good for $PTON who gets to realize revenue immediately, and good for Affirm that gets to stack quality vintage on to their books.

what he did is not that risky. The downside is only 15% if the deal blows completely and the trust dissolves, and the upside is 100-200% depending on the target and how much FOMO that will generate in the short-term. I think it's more of a matter if you are willing to let the cash sit for possibly many months.

So ppl aren't going to buy the dip on a stock that went down 20% because it was not included in the S&P 500, but now is... and the S&P hasn't even purchased their shares yet - meanwhile, longtime bear Adam Jonas turns bull and upgrades TSLA to 540.

Whats nio sitting at now ?
my original drawing is still quite close to where we're at currently actually
buy the rumor sell the news... well vaccines are here lol
Soros is shorting it like Citron did with nio, just trying to be sneaky about it. He wouldn't say a word without it making him or someone close money. He either has puts/told someone to get puts and they just cashed out or they are squeezing and gunna buy back in later. There's always another motive when there's big money involved. Gotta think outside of the box a little
As long as we print our own money and hand out gov't contracts left and right I'd never worry about it. The concept of one jenga piece taking down the tower is not a new one. The beauty of most American funds is that we take out the bad pieces and replace them with stronger ones. You would need the kind of news like "we proved widespread accounting fraud and all the numbers are faked in over half the fund" because one is simply not enough to take the rest with it.  TSLA joining the S&P will be more beneficial than not if that was your concern
do it you either make bank or go down a legend

bulls are about to feel what bears have felt the last couple of months... all of the good news in the world and market is just gonna keep drilling
I mean it ran up 25% after hours yesterday, so I guess its pretty likely that itll open pretty red and then recover over the next days. On the other hand, as the news spreads more, it might just make another bull run right at open, who knows
Well it's too early to tell but I grabbed a small position at 11,850. The last time we had a serious drop I just kept buying every 200-point dip and rode it out. This market is rigged as hell and so far always pops back to 12k after a few days

At the end of the day, index funds are just the safest way to enter the market and unless everyone pulls out at the same time it'll just keep growing so long as stocks are profitable imo

Not who you replied to, but if you want a justification that I don't believe in:

From what I remember in the first half of 2020 they found that white (European descent) people had a higher likelihood of having serious complications or death after contracting Covid due to some mutation. That group also often has a higher genetic susceptibility to other lung diseases, so it makes sense. Considering the vaccine is being rushed and the front-runners are a new class of vaccines, maybe the idea is to let the weaker white groups get the vaccine first and see if there are unexpected side effects only found once it's been administered to a large population.

Skeptical about the truth in thie link though. There is a law in Germany that prevents just this sort of thing. Most databases are kept separate and maintained individually for a reason, lest the 'good old days' of the Nazi racial profiling return.

Your TDS is blinding you bud. Trump doesn't have anything to do with the global pressure of finding a vaccine.
I‚Äôm not saying the vaccine will be completely safe, I‚Äôm very skeptical. But Trump has zip to do with it. Any president with half a brain cell would be rushing this thing through trials as well. These are not normal circumstances.

He got rid of a lot of the regulations for testing and stuff to try and rush a vaccine out as fast as possible. Again, not saying it was the wrong move.

Yup, with options its a true yolo because if you fuck up its gone. With stocks he‚Äôa yoloing multiple thousands but if it starts going bad they are still worth what theyre worth.

To be honest, it‚Äôs quite appealing
getting a vaccine that is through clinical Trial is perfectly safe and can't be compared to a console. on the other hand getting a Drug or vaccine that was not Tested enough might also result in your children growing Up without limbs (See Contergan), but thats why they Established the trials in the First place

Sell some, and keep a core position, or roll the profits into some longer dated calls like 2022 or something if you want to hold for a while.

Not gonna look it up because that would be dumb but I'm pretty sure it's when something like an earnings call happens and all the implied volatility in your contract goes to 0. Like right before the call it could up or down, so your contract had some worth because it was likely going to move, but now the momentum is going so your contract has no more implied volatility.  


This is absolutely legal advice and if I get this wrong you can sue me for losses.

As I said in the post, I‚Äôve been rolling over calls for a while. I‚Äôm currently actually not holding anything. 

I sold once it hit 25 this week because it‚Äôs a reasonable price for where the company is at currently, and the average price target. I‚Äôm not telling anyone to buy weekly calls on plug. What I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs a solid long position, and you should expect it to increase significantly over the course of next year, and exponentially soon after. If you want my current opinion on how to play Plug, it would be to buy 2-3 month out contracts once it dips back down to the 18-19 range.

Their DD isn't free.  They know they are going to drive the price down.  They don't make it a secret that they are holding short positions when they release their reports.  The thing is - their reports are not false.  This is how they get paid for their work.

If they were making shit up - I'd have an entirely different outlook on them.

Indicators were created to control, manipulate and fleece retail investors. Same way Doyle Brunson‚Äôs Super System was used to ‚Äúteach‚Äù people how to play poker. The reality is that they make amateurs more predictable.
Not sure if the website itself is legit but the article translates to:

US company Palantir:Police in North Rhine-Westphalia are testing research software from CIA consultancy

D√ºsseldorf¬†The NRW police have put a new research system into test operation, which is based on software from the US company Palantir.¬†The parent company works for secret services and the Pentagon.¬†Targeted: felons, terror suspects and child molesters.

The new system for "cross-database analysis and research" is intended to revolutionize the work of investigators: Until now, they had to search for information about a person in each system individually and then collect it by hand.¬†Now they are given a name "existing data of the process and case processing systems,
the deployment documentation, the procedure for processing traffic offenses", according to the Ministry of the Interior in a report to the state parliament.

For this purpose, data from the registration office, the national weapons register or the central register of foreigners can be used.¬†According to the Ministry of the Interior, the system is intended for the fight against terror suspects, serious criminals and child pornography.

"Employees of the district police authorities and the State Criminal Police Office of North Rhine-Westphalia who are entrusted with relevant issues will in future be able to use this software to carry out evaluations of available data," said the ministry in the report.

The test operation started on October 5th.¬†The system should run fully as early as possible in the coming year.

Yeah as long as you have 100 shares. 

I have 500 shares of NIO so I was able to sell 5 contracts. I'm looking now and it looks like the premiums aren't going for nearly as much as they were last week. I can sell 5 contracts for $70 11/27 and get $100 now. I was able to get over $400 for those same contracts (though 11/20) but were still a week out).

I think the premiums were so high because this week was an earnings week for NIO. Now next week is just a regular old boring week so they're not going for as much.

I agree with everything here, but I believe that cost basis isn't lowered if a sold put goes unexercised on a stock you own. You just pocket the premium as a short term capital gains. It only affects cost basis if exercised unless I am mistaken.

Lmao whoops yeah I thought I found the same article. I didn't think it was interesting or peculiar ya fuck, or I would've said "this is interesting". I asked if people are planning on paying for their stationaries or not. As like a joke. Hence the flair. Did you really just type all that? Retard.
What do you mean "practically"?

You think it could go to 14??
He's just mad the tech is going to implicate him in some shady business. He made money of the company that will be his downfall. Honestly, now that he is talking about wanting out I want to go Long PLTR.

Why?
Why not buy call then if it‚Äôs 100% of the time?
When did you buy?
I've gotten cucked 3 times in the past few weeks holding puts overnight and thinking, maybe this will be the time that we actually pull back overnight. Futures get pumped every night, as long as I can remember, I don't know why I think tonight will be different. It's so irritating, It's okay for us to pull back some after SPY rallying more than 10% in 2 weeks smh.
holy shit this is fuckdd lmao, 400 spy 12/18

Yes. I‚Äôm looking at current sales figures. Did vapes get slammed with taxes or restrictions? Still doesn‚Äôt account for the spike.

Doesn't this also apply to buy-and-hold Boglehead types?

Honestly, this is a solid play.  PTON has everything going for it, except that they cannot keep up with demand. Too much demand, exceeding supply.  A problem they are working on.   Earnings growing 100% Y/Y for 5 years.   Revenue growth in the most recent Q was 232% Y/Y.  Bad news of a vaccine has been priced in - leaving almost only upside available.  Right now any piece of new could be a massive positive catalyst; news about expansion into China, new products, more partnerships, and this stock goes right back to new highs.  The stock price reaction after the initial vaccine news was an overreaction.

For those that think this is a bike that goes no where - you're technically right and also totally missing the point.  PTON is more like FB/Instagram/Apple/Netflix than a stationary bike.  PTON is its own social circle with a fanatic user base gathered around a re-envisioned product experience with users subscribing at $40/month.  Covid accelerated what was already happening at PTON and it also accelerated the demise of their competition, eviscerating companies like Soul Cycle.

I think you will do very well with this investment.

You know they'll expire absolutely worthless right?

No. WSB generally does have lots of good picks and there's a reason algos mine this subreddit. The reason so many retards are constantly blowing up their accounts here is because they are buying absolutely moronic strikes, and they have no idea when to cut losses and when to take profits. 

There are a ton of genuinely unintelligent people here constantly taking winning plays and riding them into 100% losses because they were chasing a 10 bagger that was never going to come. "Diamond hands" is the dumbest shit ever and is easily the single biggest cause of retards losing money here. The better move would be to ride all the same retarded hype trains as WSB, but also try to be one of the first to jump ship and close out your positions early on the WSB meme plays.

Be aware of what he is saying though. 25% above NAV is risky if no announcement tomorrow or in coming days.

If I had no position, I would wait for the call tomorrow to end and either miss the boat or buy in for a more reasonable price. Your call though.

It's actually a great stock to swing trade. It hates being under 19 but also hates being over 23 so you buy at 20 and below and sell over 22. I've made decent profit but got a bit greedy this time around thinking it would run a bit more before it dumped again.

There is a chance it will go to $20 by Friday yes. A chance.
I sold 69 cash secured puts at 52 strike, literally right before it started tanking this past Friday.

So safe to say, I'll have 6,900 shares after Friday.
I'm typically an all options player, so I'll be writing a covered call for 69 contracts at 52 strike until they get called away.

Tons of volume on PLTR, just be ready to sell at a slightly reduced price for immediate fill.
Well, 2 insiders just sold, not an unbelievable amount, but I wonder if the market will react to it. It's a rather low volume stock so just keep an eye on it and make a decision.  


I'm personally thinking of buying a $70 put dated out to December or next year

Yeah you‚Äôre just valuing it as a car company with no growth and you‚Äôre pretty fucking one dimensional. Bye.
PLTR is great company to buy and hold for the long term. In the short term it will have a lot of volatility. They became a publicly traded company recently, and the lock up period for has not expired yet.
Didn‚Äôt realize they got much sun in Canada
If you have enough shares, sell weekly CC at your strike until your shares are called away. Then sell puts at the price you want to buy back in it.

That's likely so that they can do their DD.  Bulls who are still pumping YY after the gigantic tank job today based on the single argument that 'BIDU is buying!' are being disingenous.  BIDU hasn't committed to shit yet, because the deal isn't done.  YY will drill into nothingness like LK if there's any whiff of truth to the MW report.  It's very peculiar that YY hasn't responded at all yet even though it is now almost 3 PM in China.  The market is likely going to assume the worst tomorrow for YY.  It may drop a shit ton more.

Because you‚Äôve passed that mark: Depending on the size of your investments, I wouldn‚Äôt sell it all because the price has gone so far up. I would only sell a portion when it was going to go to something good. Student loan, house, kids college etc. don‚Äôt sell just because it‚Äôs increased in value.

There‚Äôs the problem. Since they‚Äôre public, they‚Äôre going to have to announce each contract they get. This didn‚Äôt move the stock price, because for the past two weeks, Palantir has been astronomical in price growth, meaning that this news is just confirmation and slight justification of the current price level. However, seeing the after hours movement does not inspire a level of confidence that would make me buy calls

That‚Äôs what caught my attention as well. This isn‚Äôt a meme but I was surprised a more reputable NPR program is putting out content like this but then I remembered clicks and money and they are business too.
4 hour (what I look at most for tops/bottoms) has had a consistent pickup of momentum and stays oversold on the 30s. Daily just wants to cross. It‚Äôs going to form a cup and handle and explode or implode idk which. It‚Äôs definitely lining up though.

I'd say you are retarded for calling the possibility retarded. The 4 states are all razor thin margins. It is absolutely possible - especially given the mass confusion and corruption around mail-in ballots with the Supreme Court already delivering the Trump campaign wins. Perhaps you were in the camp who believed Gore was president for sure in 2000 and anyone who thought it was Bush was retarded. LOL

There's no way to know which SPACs will announce a merger so it's hard to make money from the initial pop. I would wait for the hype to fade away, which is usually about a month or two. Then buy calls and shares when the stock has reached a low. Lately these SPACs have gone all the way back down to where they started. After the merger date, sell your shares and calls after the pop. Then buy puts right after. The merger date announcement momentum does not last more than a couple of days.
What you should've done was buy at the bottom, duh. So easy.
I wonder if I can use affirm to purchase their IPO? Thats the innovation they need to set them apart from the comp. I bet RH would like an AP integration through their shit software.

A bachelors degree isn‚Äôt a luxury and you thinking that is just sad. There are lots of school dropouts in South America that might think high school is a luxury but to us high school is a RIGHT. Yea people in South America without a high school education can survive and still be successful but they ultimately face more challenges. If you don‚Äôt have a college education in the US you will face more challenges as well, that‚Äôs the system we live in. And unemployment numbers are meaningless when most jobs available for non college jobs offer terrible wages. You fail to see the big picture and that‚Äôs just too bad. Basically in your mind if you can‚Äôt afford college well then too fucken bad son, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù you just can‚Äôt afford and you gotta live with it, or take out massive loans am I right???

None but gun to my head I‚Äôd pick FCEL, had like 20x the volume as ciic or sono today so at least you know there will be enough liquidity to get out when things immediately go south. Keep in mind you will almost certainly get immediately stopped out on open volatility on any of those three

Reading his comment again, maybe not.
If you have 100 shares of something, you can sell a call against them. So say you bought 100 tsla@400, right now you could sell something like the 11/20 $500 call for a premium of $730, you keep the premium no matter what, and if tesla is above $500 on 11/20, you have to sell your 100 shares for $500, and if tsla is under $500 on 11/20, you keep your shares (plus the $730 premium you sold the call for).

I'm long 300K+ on NIO.

Keep in mind the max pain strike is 35, meaning puts and calls with suffer the most.  
I think NIO will get near 40 EOW and maybe stay around there until end of next week before it starts recovering.

Too many option volume for expiries 11/20 and 11/27.  
Hold strong, their guidance was killer and you may have to bag hold for a month or so at the most.

I've lost 70K in value this week in NIO, but I'm not stressing b/c I'm extremely bullish on their December figures, which should propel the stock back to the 50's at a minimum.
nio keeps getting more catalysts. i got in at 7 and it hasnt stopped, just taken breaks. they just got price upgrades from 4 firms and consistently beat ER expectations a HUNDRED FOLD

You.... You think TSLA is gonna hit 1300 on Monday? And youre basing this off of fucking aurora cannibus, one of the shittiest companies I've ever heard of, having a pump and dump?

Acb barely has a billion dollar market cap that it doesn't even deserve. If you think small time retarded meme stock moves the same way as something that's a lot closer to half a trillion in market cap does you're dumb. I mean, fuck I'm not willing to do the math for something this absurd but TSLA at 1300 would probably be nearing aapl and Aramco market caps.

I will donate 2 grand to charity if TSLA hits 1300 on Monday morning.

I want to say something to a lot of the SPY put holders here.  A lot of us thought some really horrific shit would pop off in the past two weeks and that it would rip this all asunder.

I highly doubt that number is correct and suspect heavily you just made it up on the spot without doing any sort of fucking research at all. But then again, that'd be typical of someone that frequents this board.

Regardless of how valuable you feel that information is, and despite thinking it's a trash app that doesn't give you near enough information to properly invest, retail traders make up a quarter of the market after the pandemic started and robinhood has over 13 million users since August, so you do the math Sherlock, sure ain't 1% marketshare. I'll tell you that.

Down down deeper and down.
Mostly because shit companies who wouldn‚Äôt have normally gone public via traditional IPO at a NAV of $10 or higher. Any underwriter doing due diligence and creating a valuation would‚Äôve probably forgone the process midway, but reverse mergers via spac don‚Äôt really require that much DD. It‚Äôs all about PIPE investors cashing out really. The very few SPACs that are still about and trading above 10 are SPCE, DKNG, NKLA (fuck that tho) and maybe a few older ones. Look up Daseke, BLBD, NRCG, VLDR and my favorite one HOFV. Not saying some of these won‚Äôt do well, but it‚Äôs really tough picking out which ones will.

To PLUG power idiot:  


Rebuffs:   


1. Extremely explosive  
2. Terrible BTU/volume, this is the same reason natural gas never was adopted widespread in heavy duty diesel engines  
3. Emissions... hydrogen burns hot, creating plenty of NOX which is the main component that is catching shade right now in Semi and to a lesser extend automotive applications  
4. I.C.E longevity, engines that run on exclusively hydrogen will not last long.. i'm not saying engineering can't be used to eliminate the drawbacks of burning hydrogen in a I.C.E but it's still an issue that i don't think OEM's have addressed yet  
5. This goes back to BTU/volume vs diesel, basically there is just not enough power volume per volume compared to diesel or even gasoline, otherwise they would have switched semi fleets to natural gas years ago, but, same problem so that never took off.. (it also never took off because of reasons number 4 and 3).
Already up 60% on CIIC, and I didn't even need options.

I'm comparing Tesla's market cap to its perceived earnings growth. Based on the market cap, people are expecting Tesla to grow 10x faster than any company in history.

Oh yeah that bitch is going to tank hard. These SPACs pop on initial news about the merger and then the hype slowly dies. When the merger date is announced it pops again and then tanks once again right before the merger because people don't want to hold the shares during the ticker symbol change. You can't sell your shares during that time.

Because they have dogshit financials.  

Go research how Chinese companies scammed American investors for billions upon billions of dollars during the reverse merger craze of the 00s and early 10's.  Chinese companies didn't do traditional IPOs---they reverse merged with zombie shell companies that still existed on the stock market and were able to raise billions of dollars with clown car, freak show financials that no one detected because of the reverse merger.  

SPACs are very similar to those zombie shell companies.  They go public and then reverse merge with a company to go public, that way the company that's targetd can avoid a shit ton of SEC scrutiny that goes into a traditional IPO.  Tons and tons and tons of investors lost a crap ton of money on SPACs during the 00s when there was a craze.  This is the same hype again this year (NKLA, VLDR, FSR, HYLL, list goes on).  


The reason is that SPACs allow you to avoid a lot of scrutiny and stringency that goes into a regular IPO. Not all SPACs are bad --- DKNG and SPCE may be healthy, but a fuck ton are shady as fuck.  Look at the horror show of Michael Klein SPACs recently.  The only people that get rich off SPACs are the insiders.

Given that the news is slowly coming out about more lockdowns, I feel rotation back into WFH stocks will come either come tomorrow EOD or  Friday EOD!

Good luck - best case you get those shares called away for a profit and you can move that money around.

It's been a wild ride looking at it from the outside, but I have to admit that I've been considering dropping some money recently. The fuel cell/hydrogen hype is building (FCEL, PLUG). Furthermore, with all the bombshells that have dropped, is there anywhere to go but up?
No

Strange phenomena past two weeks. Small caps continuously out performing tech sector.

Did a quick research about SPACs and holy shit kind of scary how a majority of companies who started with an SPAC now trade below $10. What‚Äôs the reason behind that?
Index funds will buy about $60B of TSLA stock. Active funds (7 trillion dollars) that benchmark S&P 500 index will likely to buy another $60B TSLA. More importantly, after S&P inclusion, every 2 weeks there will be some fresh TSLA purchase from index funds. 

Insiders own 25%

Institutional shareholders 51%

Retail investors 29%

New Index funds 13%

New Shadow index funds 3%

New funds that benchmark S&P500 index 12%

That's a total of 133%. There are not so many shares for everyone.

I'm thinking a dip followed by moonshot.


Also

I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to all though tasteless, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting. No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique.
It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to
much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop,
but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling.

Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with somepaper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to
avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope
that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.
I was contemplating this
problem, when I had what seemed at the time
to be a bright idea. "Hey, this is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in
history with a lot of other regretted statements. "How many Indians could there be?" said by General Custer. "Looks like a good day for a drive!" by JFK. "There! America On-line now has complete Usenet
access!" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on.
Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would
have to clean the razor of accumulated hair, which I did by wiping it on the towel.
Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn babe. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surve my work. The towel was covered with a pile of
hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know. I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction.
I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating
in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I
thought, it would dry. Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic -molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I
stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky /sweat
combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there
and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm. Unfortunately, this exertion
caused me to sweat, and when I finally
reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and
attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks.

As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of
all, as the ripe aroma of festering /sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there,
fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own blowing
right into my face, I had only one thought: "It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks." Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my
ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks.

Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins
can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil. As if that wasn't
enough, I am now enduring further torture. As
anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad.
Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat,
rather than endure this constant agony.

Friends- DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!

Fuuuuck Triple H is such a prick. I remember liking Raw much better as a kid (watched live religiously 2006-2010) but as I got older I completely fell in love with early 2000s Smackdown. It's mind boggling how much WWE has fallen, compare the crowds back then to current crowds (well pre-covid lol).
Yea totally, is common sense illegal around here?

Well if you think of it there's two conflicting reasons to buy or sell gold.. there is the argument that increased yields means more people locking in risk free rate rather than hold gold which pays no rate.. but there is also the argument that higher interest rates=higher inflation, which gold is supposed to be a hedge for..

I am more interested if they make batteries for apple and other house hold items... batteries that's longer than a laptop's life time. that would be crazy. no electricity required for anything. they already have this kind of tech. just costs a lot. tesla is master of vertical integration.

The vaccine really won't be here till mid 2021 and that will be for front line workers.  The gen pop will at best get it over the summer.  As for this bull of 95% effective, those are limited numbers.  Will really see with first round how effective it is.

Yea....it couldn't possibly be due to the millions of shares unlocked for sale for the PIPE investors.......have you even ever read a single SEC filing for DKNG and how many PIPE shares exist and their price?

Overall, DKNG will be able to beat it. But a ton of SPACs get crushed after reverse merging, and due to PIPE investors reaming holders.  VLRD didn't even have a fuggin' lockout period for PIPE holders for christ's sake.  SPACs have a very bad reputation for a reason (mostly based off of their horrendous losses from the earlier 00s).

Not a doctor but honestly the Fed is going to push them through. They have to. I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the next few weeks. There will be people who will report side effects and the media will have a field day with it. Anti vaxxers will go nuts. Misinformation will spread all over and people will refuse it. Covid will not give a fuck and this shit will continue.
It's now down to logistics and humans humaning -- how fast can you build up supply, how quickly can you put it where it can be given to peeps, and how many retards (left or right) don't want to take the vaccine because they're (insert stupid reason here)

I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to all though tasteless, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting. No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique.
It seems my ss-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to
much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop,
but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling.

Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with somepaper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to
avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope
that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.
I was contemplating this
problem, when I had what seemed at the time
to be a bright idea. "Hey, this is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in
history with a lot of other regretted statements. "How many Indians could there be?" said by General Custer. "Looks like a good day for a drive!" by JFK. "There! America On-line now has complete Usenet
access!" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on.
Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would
have to clean the razor of accumulated hair, which I did by wiping it on the towel.
Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn babe. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surve my work. The towel was covered with a pile of
hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know. I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction.
I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating
in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I
thought, it would dry. Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic -molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I
stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky /sweat
combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there
and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm. Unfortunately, this exertion
caused me to sweat, and when I finally
reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and
attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks.

As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of
all, as the ripe aroma of festering /sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there,
fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own blowing
right into my face, I had only one thought: "It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks." Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my
ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks.

Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins
can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil. As if that wasn't
enough, I am now enduring further torture. As
anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad.
Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat,
rather than endure this constant agony.

Friends- DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!

So, what about the story that George Soros, is sorry he invested in PLTR in 2012,  and is going to sell all of his positions?

Comparing growth stocks to value or regular stocks is inappropriate. If Tesla quit pouring money into R&D, construction, all around growth, their gross profit would quadruple without growing at all. It‚Äôs silly.

You also can‚Äôt apply one industries average multiple to a company with their hand in multiple industries, especially when TSLA has 15x the CAGR and better margins, expected to grow even further as the EV, energy storage, and autonomous markets expand. 

Software companies like Apple or Microsoft do nearly the same revenue as Toyota, and grow at similar rates, but due to their stratospheric gross margins and growth potential they command a higher multiple. Like I said before, if you think Tesla will fail at everything and just be a car company, that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs undervalued if they execute on even half of what they want to.
Wait for stimulus news then yolo spy calls

Anyone know how to short hazelnuts? 

/// 

The farmer recruitment efforts of Ferrero, one of the world's biggest hazelnut buyers for its Nutella spread, may loosen Turkey's grip on the $2.8 billion industry, which is prone to volatile prices and tight supplies.

Turkey, at odds with the United States over a failed coup last year, produces 70 percent of the world's hazelnuts, leaving buyers such as Ferrero, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), and Nestle SA (NESN.S) vulnerable.

Contrary to the teachings of this video, dropped $850 on a 01/15/21 $115 Alteryx call. Really good time to get in. Hasn‚Äôt been this low since January aside from one month. 

Probably going to sell mid December or as soon as there‚Äôs a $10 bump because that‚Äôs the way this stock rolls. Won‚Äôt become rich off a $10 bump but I just want to increase my monthly salary by $500 a month to offset student loan repayment starting next month for me. 

Not sure how alteryx will do in Christmas. Maybe it follows the market direction and soars but then again what kinda fucking nerd is using alteryx during Christmas season.

*looks in career mirror* career: accountant. More like busy season than Christmas season. Yeah nah fuk that this thing is going to soar by 12/31/20.

BTW if you don‚Äôt know what options are. Do some research, but essentially think of them as betting on a stock to either go up (call) or down (put). You buy one of these and gains are magnified 100x.
Man I was just fucking around with some guy (all in fun too, nothing against that dude) here and he went ahead and deleted all his posts in the same chain. I wonder if he deletes his app too when he loses money on options.

Good thing fertility rates are coming down since there won't be that many jobs left in the future.
Don't think that's a thing -- MACD is a measure over time/cycles; you want a broader view as opposed to daily (just use candles for that).  When the value > avg, prices tend to be rising; reverse for reverse.  You'll still have mini-swings within a defined range regardless of which way the value is going, that's why I use the -5%: enough to give room for growth but also enough to stop a skid into the abyss.  Pick a bunch of your favorite stocks and look at their cost at the beginning and end of a positive MACD-value cycle; mostly you'll find a profit between the two endpoints (and a loss when the MACD-avg is higher).
What‚Äôs the test in?
Nah, if the dollar is worth less the stock price goes up
For future reference, take the Break Even Price and subtract the average cost to find the strike price.

In this case $491.17 - $1.17 = $490.

Only call is 110x$3.5 C MFA 1/18.  Now I just gotta decide if I close my spy puts and buy longer ones tomorrow or pray it keeps dropping friday.
Why
Im at boston market right now eating chicken and corn bread
No good reasons exist why you shouldn‚Äôt. Look at their presentation and competitor analysis. They beat all of em in every aspect.
‚ÄúTesla will replace an S&P 500 company that will be named closer to the effective date‚Äù from an article I read.  Wait so we can probably narrow the list down on who it would be right?  Someone has to be unprofitable/declining
Lmao love hearing they pumped hella a few days after i sell
Okay, blah, blah, you got some facts, but for someone who has no idea what they're talking about {me}, how would you explain ARK investment buying loads of shares if this is a dumpster fire
No liquidity
I recommend boston market its really good
Can confirm. They also don't pay well.
PLTR boys listen up 

The last few days insiders have been selling shares. Today (11/18) our boy Peter sold a good number of shares plus stock was shorted pretty heavily. Here‚Äôs the document Peter filed with the SEC 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000120919120059294/xslF345X03/doc4.xml

This is part of the reason the stock hovered around $18 for a good amount of the afternoon. Others sold shares this week, links below. This confirms that PLTR has retard strength, and tomorrow will be a face ripper. The good news: lack of insider selling, shorts r fuck, and Peter literally being a gay super villain should bring us to tendie down.

Nice post.  I am also very keen on PLUG becoming the "Standard Oil" of green H2.  EV cars are sexy investments right now, but that is not where the real money is for PLUG.  But if car announcements drive the stock price for now, I'm ok with that.  It just bugs me that people are knocking PLUG when there are so many tangible assets and products here and yet, as of today and after all of the tomfoolery so far, PLUG and NKLA have essentially the same market cap.  So much for efficient captial markets ;)

Hey CIIC-gang (or whatever you're going to call yourselves): have an exit strategy before you buy-in; time to hit that was last week with the other insiders, or yesterday when it got announced.  I'd say check the technicals but who am I kidding?  God speed autists....

One of the problems I see with the IT industry is that it is somewhat emasculating for men. You have to spend hours upon hours behind a computer screen perfecting your craft, and hardly anyone outside of your immediate circle understands what you do. So the typical alpha male things of proving yourself, like physical prowess, good looks and charm, being able to eloquently speak and write, all go out the window behind a god damn computer screen.

Walmart (WMT) has a 23.76 P/E and lots of upside potential with taking market share from bankrupt brick and mortar retail and expansion into E-comm.  I should probably take all my money out of AMZN and put it in WMT but I'm in the hole, you know how that goes.

‚ÄúImagine your bank credited your account each morning with $86,400 that never carried over to the next day. What's left at midnight is lost. What would you do? You would spend it. Time is such a bank. Every morning it credits you 86,400 seconds. Every night, whatever you failed to invest wisely is lost. Time carries over no balances. Allows no overdrafts. Each day it opens a new account with you. Each night it burns the day's records. If you fail to use the day‚Äôs deposits, the loss is yours. There's no going back. No drawing against tomorrow. You have today.‚Äù

God I fucking hate LinkedIn. I‚Äôd YOLO that $86k into TSLA calls every morning.
I‚Äôve been driving an electric car for about a year and a half and a Model 3 since March. Obviously I prefer Tesla super chargers, but ChargePoint is right up there with them and EVGo is a distant third. I live in the Bay Area and electric vehicle saturation is massive out here. 

I live in a small beach town on the coast and whenever I drive the ten miles to the store I usually pass about 20 Tesla‚Äôs round trip. The chargers at the grocery store are EVGo and I really don‚Äôt like them, their machines aren‚Äôt easy to operate and I have to use an RFID card as there‚Äôs no ApplePay for it. 

In the downtown area there are two ChargePoint connectors on the corner of a few streets, I think about six total and at the bank there‚Äôs the electrify America charger, I tried to use them once but they weren‚Äôt online, I tried to use them after they went online and couldn‚Äôt get them to work. At a mall nearby there are these chargers by SemaConnect and you have to enter the charging stall number into the app on your phone, I‚Äôve watched people have no idea how to operate them and just not charge. Blink chargers look retarded and I‚Äôve never used them. 

For some reason, nobody else can get the software to work properly like ChargePoint has, it‚Äôs the closest thing to what Tesla offers. At a super chargers I park and plug in and then sit in my car and watch YouTube. At ChargePoint stations I park, use ApplePay, plug in and watch Netflix. At any other station I have to solve a riddle to figure out how to charge my car, they all suck. 

But, sometimes you might need juice and have to charge somewhere other than ChargePoint. Well you‚Äôre still going to use the ChargePoint app to find that place because they have every station listed in their app. 

ChargePoint will continue to be the market learner with charging stations. I have $2,000 coming to me from a gig a did last weekend and I‚Äôm going to by $2,000 worth of ChargePoint shares because I don‚Äôt know shit about options and don‚Äôt want to lose all my money just yet as I‚Äôm just about to cross that $25,000 PDT threshold.

they also have to build the factory they mention in the presentation, though i don't think that's for the buses

it's good to have competition. just wondering who will come out on top

F GE GM are your options to play.
Why not keeping the original $450 Call for the entire day?
I would say that might have been true before Trump. I think the Dems are pissed that the Republicans let Trump run the GOP the way he does now.
W
Shares of SBE if you want a long term hold and to be able to sell covered (if you‚Äôre a fellow RH bitch) calls  once the merger happens
Bro just smoke a blunt and lay your ass to sleep easy
Always a good time to buy calls if they're for a good company and at least 365 days to expiry
how about: resourceful
Bought PLTR at 19 calls at 19 and sold at 18 AMA

‚ÄúBest market makers‚Äù. Yea buddy you realize market makers are firms right? Not individuals? Cmon man. 

Like I said think about it like a roulette wheel. Everyone bets black. Casino isn‚Äôt gonna change the payout just because everyone bets black. Same thing for options. Supply and demand isn‚Äôt 100%. It isn‚Äôt as extreme as roulette but it‚Äôs analogous.

Also just FYI, my friend works at Citadel. He‚Äôs an MIT grad and every single person on his team is from a top 10 college from undergrad or a PHD.
NIO DEC 2021 Calls thats the only way.

If you decide to do this break me off bud.
$27 would be too easy though.
Now that's what I call a tendie!!!üòÅ
I think this is a prime example these politicians just say what the base wants to hear. They‚Äôre actors. Heck, even that feud between the Democrats and Republicans is just a show. They all take money from the same lobbyists. 

This morning, Bill Clinton on some interview stated that he allowed China into the WTO so they can be a democracy eventually. He was shocked it didn‚Äôt work out. So, which party is pro business, globalization, outsourcing, etc?
Did you downvote me üò≠
Don't sell after spy move. Sell 6 months after it becomes boomer stock. Buy spy calls cause tesla is spy now

Everyone knows that its only a fact when it benefits your belief

The key takeaway is that no one can really beat the market consistently over the long term and your best odds of success is a low cost broad based index fund.  There just saved you 2000 in tuition.
so should i wait for CIIC pullback like any other SPAC or just FOMO at open cause fuck it
yea, CIIC
Yes. Hard lesson sometimes son.

Bravo
You have to start your own business like me :)
No.  Have kids, are annoying as fuck.  Negative zero horny.
We would see a cb in that case which would probably bleed over into next week.

Would be quite the sight to see
Assuming there is a huge sales of stocks. If insiders are still holding, your have to buy back at q higher price.

Lol basic market function...anything that‚Äôs a derivative of another product isn‚Äôt subject to basic supply and demand duh. Thought you would learn that in your intermediate microeconomics class.

Think about it like a roulette wheel. If everyone bets black and only bets black, it doesn‚Äôt change the odds. Simple one there for you to understand.
Brah people in on here can turn $200 into 60k. What you doing wrong?
At this point you can either walk away with your losses or just be an autist and go OOM. Preferably I like playing the second option. Just gotta pick your poison my friend.

I'd say to download both.

And, given that I started with $100, I've only been able to afford 3 shares of CRSR along with 1 share of another company. I bought on October 22nd, at about $25.50, giving me a (roughly) 30% profit from only CRSR.

I'm unable to work for now given my education schedule, so $100 was all my money. I was all in. And no, I don't know the shit going on. I just happened to search for Corsair after thinking: "I should probably put this money into something useful by now... what companies-" until I looked down at my keyboard, proceeding to dig into their situation.

Agree with this, I rolled my Jan 300c‚Äôs and into some June 300c‚Äôs. More ‚Äúboring‚Äù but feel so much more confident (it will probably start running up too now)
Im sure she'd appreciate laying in your cum while you shitpost on WSB, she seems like the type of person that have a sense of humor, and enjoy the irony of that sort of thing.

LOL, he should ask ‚Äúhave you made any money?‚Äù , ‚Äúyes I‚Äôve made 50k in one trade‚Äù. ‚ÄúWow, what‚Äôs your overall PNL?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs negative 200k‚Äù

My moves are use profits from Tesla calls to buy NIO long
Not if it opens at $37 if it follows the same trend as it has the whole week I should make some nice tendies
Would you rather see 37% losses because I‚Äôm planning on doing that next so I don‚Äôt get kicked off WSB?
Damn

Is there any news or scheduled announcements tomorrow that might send the market further down or are bulls good to buy calls?
That's what I was thinking too, there's no way this is comparable to Netflix.
