Ah shit, he’s buying calls guys, we might have a red day tomorrow. Be prepared, be safe!!

Weed stocks were creating a new market whereas EVs are expanding on/bettering a current market.  If you can’t tell the difference then you deserve to miss out on the gains.
Yeah dawg
Goodnight fren, remember sleep with your mouth closed so the spiders dont crawl in

Edit: I’m just going to go ahead and also downvote my comment
I'm so proud of myself. 
I figured it out:

While Dow and S&P Futures are red, Nasdaq Futures remain green based on TSLA opening at 530
Kinda annoying tbh

Nothing is speaking to me, I should be all over DLTR since I called it last time but now I'm not so sure...
Well goddammit! Getting in before WSB does is pure magic. 

You gave double-triple backwards talk while remaining some level of professionalism. 

Take my up vote and award.

Any specific reason why you chose the 12/18 expiry. 2021 is probably the year we see a good correction in stocks.

PLTR, KANDI
I live in SF, and can confirm there are lots of pussies here.
This is true.  However, another issue that Momentus has is that their CEO is not a US citizen.   Why does this matter?  Because rockets are considered national security and technologically sensitive.  Their Russian CEO isn't even allowed to see the technology that the company has.  The dumbest part - he invented half of it.  I'm not making this shit up.
BABA, NIO, PLTR all in.

“It’s done really well”. That’s really modest for a 870% gain. I’m happy about 10% growth in about 2 months, although I don’t use options or buy on margin.

Same. How far out are yours
Ok I’m pretty new so can you explain why you’d be getting more money, just for calling what price it’s gonna hit eventually? How is options not just saying “oh sell/buy my stock when it’s at X price”? I’m so confused about the high volatility thing

Because a lot of investment companies are pouring money into Tesla by default for getting into the S&P. Add this with the fact that tesla has been stuck in a 420 range bound bind for months now it makes too much sense . There is going to be fomo but that won't make much difference. The main squeeze is all of these call spreads that are being bought . Tesla 700+ by december 21

I'm getting RKT vibes from this  - old company, long established book of business and business model, nothing fundamentally different from other companies competing in its sector, unlike PLTR which uses AI and big data and other buzzwords to do all kinds of stuff that's never been done before. Also, no CEO with crazy hair, no PayPal Mafia. It'll be a good steady grower because it's a big company with huge corporate and government clients, but it won't see explosive growth. Pass, unless there's some crazy run-up in the stock and I FOMO in a week lol.

When COVID hit they were an easy choice for organizations that prior did not have a conferencing solution, but as it progresses, those same orgs see they need a collaboration suite and they won't pay for a stand-alone product. In comes MSFT and GOOG. PLT and CSCO have the major baller systems. AMZN, RNG, Mitel, VZ, LogMeIn, and others are already established and offer a bigger suite.

The underlying means the underlying stock. The option is never underlying. 

What you need to do is set the graph to say $2 and $40 (reflecting the scenario where PSTH stock price goes up, not down) and then it'll be more accurate.

It’s a spac, but not just any spac. It only has 1 month to complete a merger or it liquidates and delists, which means we are very likely to get a merger announcement in the coming few weeks. You won’t have to bag hold this thing for 6 months hoping for a merger. They are also rumored to be deep in talks with company Microvast, which sells fast charging batteries for electric vehicles. What happens to EV spacs whenever a merger is announced? Moon. What is the downside? Minimal. The stock is trading at $10.30 which means you are only risking 3% with a tremendous upside potential. You might even want to hold long term if they get a great merger like Microvast.

Firstly, if the acquisition falls through, PSTH pays back $20 (the issued price) for every share. This minimizes the loss and almost ensures that it doesn’t go under $20 per share. Also, this SPAC could possibly be the biggest acquisition ever.

Um...because writing an algorithm and following data science models will be alot easier to make money in the market? Let me know when you find a success story.
Well, writing covered calls requires you have 100 shares of the stock against which you write (create) and sell a call option. You're agreeing to sell the 100 shares at the strike price for a number of cents per share. This requires sufficient capital to own 100 shares of something. You can do this every week.

Cash-secured puts are similar, in that you have sufficient cash in the account to purchase 100 shares of the stock. You write a put contract and agree to purchase 100 shares at the strike price (probably lower than today's price). You sell the put contract for a number of cents per share.

Both of these tactics require significantly more capital, but are "safer" than just buying options. For me, the results of selling a call or put option are win/win. Either I keep the premium upon sale when the option expires worthless, or I sell-get called (or buy-get put) the stock at a profit (or discount) that I already know I'm happy with.

Yes, this takes more capital. But can easily generate 0.5-1% return every week. That adds up over time. The element of ruin isn't as severe as buying call/puts. If you are young, your biggest commodity is time. Use it to your advantage. 

I've tried everything else. This is what works for me.

You should read a lot more, watch youtube videos, and maybe trade a simulated account before trying real money. There are people who have killed themselves over their losses. Don't lose your humanity over this.

Check out the r/investing and r/thetagang subs. This sub is informative and entertaining, but you have to sift through tons of shit to find a pearl of wisdom.

Its more like, you've known about PLTR for years because who the fuck hasn't heard of the sketchy shit they're into, so you buy after the direct listing because you know, hey, this is basically a CIA stonk, I'm not betting against this.

Basically, if a WSB post is telling you to buy calls or puts on some shit, and this is the first time you're hearing of the stonk or the DD or whatever, stay away. When you're holding something WSB starts memeing, time to be worried- but there is meme magic potential.

I’ve made a little over $9k ytd on Tesla calls. I don’t go seriously over the money so I guess I don’t belong on wsb but whatever. Tesla likes to have run ups and you have to have the guts to hold on down days and know when to take profits, because then it likes to consolidate for weeks at a time until another breakout.

you have absolutely no capacity to consider long term issues.
Nothing worse than going on a date with a hot chick and her having a dead tooth. It fucks up the whole vibe. You try to ignore it, you tell yourself dude, she’s hot we’re having a good time, it’s not a big deal. Then you get a waft of that stank ass tooth and it completely crushes your mojo. Then you make out and you have to fight the urge to get the fuck out of there finally drowning yourself in booze like the goddamn alcoholic you are.

It was like one of the front teeth. Next to the k9 ones.
The one problem with your argument is the deflationary affect and low interest rates are actually what’s been driving the market up. High growth large companies such as Apple, Facebook, amazon, google, Tesla, Uber, ect, ect. Are only trading at 100s time PE (and forward PE in some cases) because discount rates are so low that it doesn’t matter if you’re discounting earnings back 10 years. It’s only when inflation hits that interest rates will rise and tank the house of cards. I’m sorry to tell you that you’ve jumped the gun. Once inflation comes, the market will topple

I wouldn't take this trade. Sure there's potential for downside, but the holders of this stock are buffet boys who care about the real estate assets and the long term value there. 

MTN owns some of the best real estate in the world. Not to mention it's already a fairly socially distant activity outside lifts/lines. They managed to run Whistler this summer without issues in Canada and that was without allowing US customers due to travel restrictions.

Can I buy calls on your IQ? I don't think it can go any lower.

I like to get stonks in sectors that I know will do well in the future then take profits on a good day.
Typically $500k or a “Premium or Private Client Group customer” which I think means you let them manage part of your portfolio

Pretty fucking lame but it’s probably the only way to get it cheaper than everyone else

I don’t know much about the company tbh. I just like the way the chart is setting up for a big move to the upside. I highly doubt the 100$+ move up on last earnings was logical. I only got to ride puts on the way down. This time I want to get the gains on the way up and down.
You fool you could have turned that -30% to +1000% then -234%
Market will be green or slightly down futures are sideways
Already baked in.  The announcements alone pushed us higher.  Who assumed then that fda would not approve to limit the rise?
The biggest thing they have going for them are their piles of cash. If they can pivot into tech or acquire something, then who knows...
As a bull, I find these scared, desperate posts hilarious.
Yeah -.70 really helping bulls right now.. no I definitely meant bulls not bears. Bears win tomorrow
Back in the early 2000’s he was very bullish on Cracker Barrel. A decade later it was like up 10% or so? So clearly he knows what he’s doing.

Let winners run. Cut losers short. 

Problem we try to time tops and bottoms which 99.99% of us can not do consistently. 

Result? By holding losers and not holding winners. We are always playing catch-up. Either do both or don’t do either one. 

Since we can’t time tops and bottoms, we see our option dip in value and we hold, sometimes it goes back up and we sell immediately to take profits. I mean why not? We were losing and now it’s in the green so sell!

Other times, it just keeps going in the red and we hold. A trade like this will offset many small gains.
You’re wrong from me but that’s also why I’d never be in that position in the first place

I think that Elon wants to build a self sustaining colony on Mars before he dies. That'll be his legacy.

And I just don't see how SpaceX gets that level of funding by launching a few payloads every month. IPO is a very realistic scenario imo

I'm not even fucking around, this is one of the stupidest plays in WSB history.  Reeks of a 22 year-old business major.  Congrats on losing all your money.

Maybe this was doomed from the beginning or it was designed to go the big boys only. 

Maybe the government should’ve sent checks directly to people. Same goes for extending unemployment benefits. Bailing out companies doesn’t work. It just pushes out the inevitable. It also opens up the program to corruption, of course.

Only trying to help, you can always read the SEC filing. The floor is still intact at this point. As much as we all love loss porn I’d way rather see you yolo into something that has actual potential for a ten bagger

Exactly, this is all bullshit. We been having months after months with protests and Covid didn't spike and the Gov didn't give a damn about that, now the problem is staying open after 10pm, give me a fucking break. What does it matter if im at a restaurant or a bar, on my own table with my buddies or family, social distanced from other tables and outdoors, before 10 or after 10pm, what difference does it make. We already not allowed to have bars open indoors or be close to other people that are not in our group.

You can say that again, I better buy some calls.
how about you call it what everyone else calls it.
Anyone have Nikola puts for December’s lockup expiration?

Be honest, all of you wouldn't hesitate to go all in with another weekly even if you turned $1,000 into $750,000.
I quit my job right now and I work for you
when did this news come out? PM or AH?  
i only care about getting out of my massive position of airlines calls expiring next week i bought for thanksgiving play.   
and then cali shut down and munichin made some rtrded comments...   
so praying to god to get out even with 50% of the money...
Eh, their cloud computing isn't *that* advanced tbh
Any one here holding EOS energy?
They make zinc hybrid batteries which are cheaper than lithium ion batteries, fire proof, don’t explode like lithium batteries and have longer discharge period. They are particularly useful for power grids and they have installed their batteries in few grids and even made few agreements with some grids in USA especially California grids.
The positive thing is it’s USA company and made in USA ( Pittsburgh).
It completed SPAC reverse merger few days ago.
Nobody tell him
Fucking genius.

I’d look into SPACs a little more, shares can be cashed out at $22 so that’s a pretty solid price floor. Once your done bleeding your only chance to profit is he announces someone other than Stripe cause the sell off will be legendary. Realistically though if it goes under 20 it’s coming right the back up so don’t be a greedy bear just take the profits

Pretty long time. Safe but long. Problem with an account that size is you have to take losses depending on which tickers you play. If you have enough capital to actually just hold 100 shares of Tesla then you can basically not lose money wheeling it, but for you you'd have to take some risk or play AMD or a smilar ticker for meager gains or something.

Honestly in this stupid market you’re spot on. The key is buying the spy puts dated at least a couple weeks out and not paper handing on the green rallys (even when they last a few days). We have been so up and down because of the volatility of the world right now — any piece of news sends the market haywire. Even if your timing isn’t perfect you can profit on both sides. 

Anyway, i hope it all ends soon and you get to be social again. Best of luck, friend.
Remind me! 1 week
No different than options lol. But if you take an interest to it and do your homework you’ll do well and realize it’s all simple. I remember I would hours scrolling every steroid forum. From chats long dead from like 2002. Taking notes and learning as much as I could. 

Been using for 7 years can’t imagine being natty ever again.

In my opinion the market is desperate for places to invest. It’s buying value at any sign of solvency because tech has such shit inflated prices, and then rotates right back to tech at the first signs we aren’t recovering.

Well compared to Razer, Corsair has gaming peripherals and computer hardware. They also have greater revenues. If Razer can sit pretty at $3B, why can't Corsair?
Where have you seen low mask adherence? I live in the south and have not seen a single person in a single store without a mask in months. Do airports not require masks?

Probably down with the rest of the market. It’s been mooning all week. Time to take some profits, enjoy the weekend and reassess on Monday.
Must buy PUMP
Of those companies ads are really only relevant for Facebook/Google and are offset by increased time on the platform from people who still have their high skill, high paying jobs and are just working from home (most consumers). Q3 earnings for those companies showed even with restrictions, ad spending has bounced back. After all, if people can’t leave the house after 10PM to go to the bar/restaurants they’ll stay home watch Netflix, browse social media and stare at ads, and spend the money they would’ve blew at the bar to buy things from Amazon/Etsy/Shopify based on ads they saw on Instagram/Pintrest using Paypal. Instead of going to the gym they’ll order Pelotons. They might even order a Tesla since they can’t take public transit anymore.

Yes there’ll be an overall decrease in spending due to the loss of jobs by low wage restaurant/bar/local business workers, but that’s actually a net positive for the stock market because the rest of the spending from the people who still have jobs is being redirected from local business that don’t trade on the stock market to a small handful of companies that do. Money will rotate out of “value” and back into tech, but the overall market valuation/index will increase (not the Dow and Russel ofc) and then when a vaccine comes some money will flow back into value and the market might correct if money starts flowing back into small businesses.

The biggest risk to the markets are probably to banks due to loan defaults and low interest rates, which could have a ripple effect to the market, I’ll give you that. If airlines/cruise lines start declaring bankruptcy and the government isn’t willing to bail them out that would also be a problem.
Closed at $27.23 today. I can see it dropping to $26.50. Good luck.

Hedge funds ya dingus. Manipulating futures pricing is literally hedge fund 101. It's a low-volume environment that affects the actual equities market, so it's the best place to manipulate price action. Every single hedge fund on earth with over 10 mil or so in liquidity does this. And you can just watch the order flow and see it happen in real time. Not sure why you are acting like I am a butt-hurt conspiracy theorist when this is open information and not a secret.

If you still have positions you really believe in switch over to longer dated calls, won’t be as much percentage wise profit but you also won’t be swinging 30% in a day which is way better for mental health.

Threw in deep in the March dip. Been holding a lot of Tesla, amazon, nVda, CRSPR for a while. Bought bottom of oil, airlines, etc. 

Building out from that it’s various options for ~5k bets each...
+winners: CRSPR, lyv, a CDO/mortgage company I honestly don’t remember, except thatI bought when may jobs report came in under expectation and sold the next Monday for +100%
Losers: also lyv. Lulu. 

Never the stones to go balls deep anywhere. 

Generally. I’ve felt in the last year that big news has been easier to trade. It’s been A LOT of volatility and big desks probably aren’t able to unwind positions as easily as a retail trader with cash and a willingness to read news for an hour in the morning. Scraping wsb for ideas (not recos)

He can force the change with a larger stake. He can force the change with a buyout. They can change based on the threat of the above. Or he can walk away. Last one seems less likely, but we will have to see.

Meanwhile, the stock is going up regardless so I'll just enjoy that until we get more info.

lol the game gets easier when you can sell millions in covered calls and just chill on a value stock. 

I actually look at fidelities key statistics tab on the main options page to see top orders for the day. It’s definitely a lagging indicator but cool to see what the big guys are doing. 

Thoughts on AMZN calls? I feel like these times of “sleepy amzn” is when IV can come down and you can take a shot a monster gains if/when it takes off.
This logic is faulty. With the interest rates being super low, most people who can afford homes and were on the fence are buying one (mortgage lower than rent) and the ones owning are refinancing (further reducing payments). Reduced inventory cause of demand increases price not because it's a bubble. The checks are longer and more rigid than 2008 so it's not a bubble. Will there be homes on the market next year cause of Covid job losses? Most certainly, but with the fed committed to not increase rates, for every seller there will be a buyer. Even in 2010/2011 when the effects of recession hit and homes were at a  50% discount, they sold out and appreciated considerably in the next few years

word on the street from people not retarded is that some big player is keeping the stock down. they're selling virtually all the options and reaping the premium. when they want it to go up, they will let it. the financials and success of this company over the past year has zero correlation to the stock price.

I can agree it's going up in the long term. But people who think it's rocketing up in the matter of days are delusional.

Oh, but I guess this is WSB.
Here's the thing though. Any stock choice can be explained in a convincing way; knowing why somebody chose the stock they chose doesn't necessarily help you that much. It's the process of sorting the genuine promise from the hype, and then evaluating that promise, that makes bets good. And that's a much, much harder skill to communicate.

So what’s the time travel formula?
sell off was earnings coinciding with general market selloff and death of ipo hype, perfect storm to bring it down. It's being kept so low because tutes get to buy more shares for cheap while selling loads of options to idiots like me and OP who see this is a great company to invest in. Yes, the billion buyback should increase the price substantially, but I think they're sort of holding back for now to see how big the sell-off is when lockup period ends in feb.
It seems quite likely. Cohen wants to change GME a lot

My parents are deaf and my dad can barely form English sentences yet ran away from home at 16, was class president in college, worked for IBM when they were Facebook, quit and started his own company, has been making six figures ever since, invented the fucking red lights at the DC metro, and put $25,000 on Apple in 2003 and guess how much the fuck that is now.

Still, he thinks Trump is a 'moderate' and says the same shit fifty seven times a day, so I have to remind myself that I'm not looking at a retard but a full-bore fucking resplendent autist.

Mom's a tard though.
I literally wet myself. Thank you.
Still waiting for robinhood to grace me with that beautiful 0DTE message.
I can't wait to see the collective orgasm over the DoorDash IPO.
Honestly, if playing options, there are 3 ways to go about it.  


1) You sell them to autists like the group here. Thetagang is an example. Selling puts intelligently has about an 85% likelihood of success, but your profits are limited to the premiums you receive. If you do it on a momentum stock and ride the wave up, while rolling  your contracts up as it increases, you can make a fortune (I made about 300k on SHOP in 2019 doing that). However, you need to pay attention to it as you can be forced to buy a stock that implodes and doesn't recover for a while, so it's REALLY important to follow it.  


2) You YOLO on calls/PUTS, making an all-in bet or two onto a stock or two that you REALLY like and that you're really confident will work out. Your bet doesn't need to be perfect, but it needs to be intelligent. EX: Don't buy 1000$ calls on TSLA expiring next friday, you're guaranteed to lose.  
BUT: if you buy 600$ Calls, if the stock runs up to 550 on Monday, you'd likely make like 30% on your investment. (Just be smart enough to sell the options before closing the position.)  


3) You buy long-dated calls moderately on stocks you like. Ex: You want to buy BABA, but don't want to risk more than 5000$, well buy 5000$ worth of options expiring in May, you could end up with 1 or 2 contracts, but that's like 100-200 shares, which "control" 25k worth of shares each. This'll limit your losses to the 5k you bet on the stock, but you still get to ride the upside.  


for 5k, you could buy 1-2x TSLA  Jan 21 550c, which have plenty of time value and will ride the wave if it keeps running.  


You could also make a bigger bet on PLTR or something else that has solid momentum to ride the wave.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps, good luck with your journey!

This is correct. My mom taught community college for one and a half semesters, as a hobby, and then gave up trying to teach hooting retards for no pay.

Isnt #1 the biggest issue for this thesis right now? I remember reading an article saying SP is gonna do it in 2  parts like its a set thing.
I rode with you on the PRPL train. Tendies were made. 

I've got my entire portfolio in PSTH. 1,500 shares avg. Cost 23.02. 

I'm thinking about selling Dec 25p. I'm not accustom to puts (it feels wrong to bet against growth). What is my exposure if I sell 15 contracts?
Ya Allah, did you mean to visit r/MuslimNoFap? In challah you will be victorious.

You had me at T&A.
In the market for a rare cat breed. Looked up the price on a savannah, mfs costs 20K. But it would be worth it to give my boomer neighbor a heart attack to see a leopard outside.

Fisker designed some amazing cars... Aston Martin DB9, Aston Martin V8 Vantage,Fisker Mustang Rocket, etc....very bullish on this one long term
Lol until you hit 35, then you're the now laid off boomer. But it really shows how people got snake bit. They believed that being middle management Chad's raining hell down on people and forcing the kids into gigs would benefit them forever.

Last year I talked with a boomer at a party who was just an arrogant turd. He loved shitting on kids saying they're lazy blah blah. I told him that dude companies love firing people his age and replacing them and their is no loyalty left anymore. Never did get his name or see if he's one of those laid off this time around but still never count those chicken tendies before you own the wendys. Otherwise you're working there
Without question
Put all 2k into 11/23 spy 345 puts. I dare you.

Who got BABA calls?
Everyone should. They're paid to analyze. It's far from perfect but the average of each of the analysts PT is a good way to gauge how the market feels about it. Example. Costco is basically at the PT so it probably has very little room to run from here, immediately priced in the special dividend. Even possibly a good short. If analysts start raising guidance I'd change course. This is just one factor tho..anyone that trades off 1 piece of info is a moron. If 5 things are telling me the same story, i'll buy it.
Im sorry but if they look like that...your uh... swimmers might be..... sinkers.
I can’t believe he fired the autist that invested in this for him. Dude more than doubled but he’s morally opposed? Lmao, since when does Soros let data mining companies get in the way of his moral compass?

I can already tell tomorrow is gonna be a really weird day

Boomer stocks are gonna open up gapped down obviously (except cruise lines for some fucking reason fuck your puts), Europeans can smell the color red from 10 miles away using their natural-born selling instinct

Pfizer emergency authorization news will probably hit near market open

Schumer today said his and McConnell’s staff will be talking tomorrow about stimulus, we’ll probably have a ‘stimulus talks goin well’ pump in the afternoon

Yesterday NYC announcing school closures crushed things like energy... but it rebounded to finish up again today. Will the market take 1 day to forget about the Cali news too?

I think Boomer stuff opens lows and crawls back up through the day

One of the methods used to axe expenditures is to eviscerate middle-management positions. These roles are primarily held by professionals who are primarily in the 40-years-old and higher range. The positions are either done away with or juniorized, in which mid-to-senior-level workers are replaced with younger employees with considerably less experience.

Cheeto-Jesus is going to continue to lay a minefield for sleepy’s crew. Afghanistan was the first move since B can’t touch it without political consequences. CARES disproportionately helps minorities and the poor and will be a bitch to fix w/o a dem majority. It expires in December so the market will limp along until then when it will dump hard without it. 

Step 3 will be Chyna. Guarantee it. He can easily institute requirements for transparency that Chyna would never be able to follow (including human rights requirements). Sleepy and the dems will have their hands tied. The likelihood of some move against chyna has been partially responsible for Baba’s stonk performance lately, since it will be one of the top targets. Chyna hasn’t engaged in mutual currency devaluation that every other major currency has, including the dollar. A move against Chyna is going to have major economic impacts, Cheeto knows it. Fukr wants revenge he and it’s possible he’s going to get it.

I bought a out at 350% IV. Share continued dropping several percent  IV down to 280% l, put value went down quick.
I'd roll over into The Jan 15th calls instead. The premium isn't ultra high considering the amount of time you get, and it'll let you hold through the re-balance dates of most of the funds/ETFs.

Sir, this is a casino.
I think your understanding of what a daily chart is is incorrect.  A daily chart spans a timespan of weeks to years, depending on how much you zoom in and out.  It sounds like you're think of an intraday chart as a daily chart.  Daily charts have a resolution of one data point per day but a span of many days.

JFrog. They got many products like Artifactory which is an artifact repo. Xray for scanning vulnerabilities (not really familiar). and couple more sht. Their main thing is Artifactory and used in most IT companies. everyone is slowly transitioning from their old docker regiries, maven repos, npm repos to Artifactory.
I bought these EOD SO Maybe a -3% would be nice
Why do you say that?
Tech won't be as severely impacted given the nature of tech. But their customers who they rely on for ad dollars will be. 

Market is current overbought (even tech) if you look at the 10 year trend I'd expect tech to drop if the overall market does but to be safer than something like a cruise stock or retail chain

The two big bets I made recently: PLTR, Sold 90 puts (20x 17.50 12/4 30x 16.00 12/4 and 40x 17.5 12/11) and bought 10x 14c 11/20.  
Bought 100x 14p 12/11 as insurance. Net premium is about 7200k for 23,500 maximum risk. 30% maximum return isn't too shabby all things considered.

BPY: sold 50x 11p march 21, 50x 11p feb 21, 32x 16p Dec 20, 32x 17.5p Dec20 and 32x 19p Dec 20.  
All of the BPY puts are naked.
Except over here, the ICE is strong support that it keeps bouncing off of and your ball floats generally upward (stocks go generally upward)
I like this joke but bragging about money is wack
garbage lol
I’m still bag holding from ER.  (Sold a shit load of puts and took the shares,  real estate is still hot as shit right now even tho down cycle is coming).  Bought a lot of dec 28 calls.
no
Really!!!
PIC. It’s actually profitable
I need to make a couple good plays here so I can move cause the weather is nice so my windows are open and I'm hearing normies having mental breakdowns outside.
Congrats man enjoy reaping what you sowed! Hard work pays off every time.
Yo how is 30% of 300,000 = 30,000. You been getting robbed dumb mother fucker.
Might sell some AAPL and pick up some boomer shares of Roku
Dude, depression and anxiety here too. I think it's the laid back retards that make it nice. Be sure to hit up the Stocks and Options channel on the WSB discord. Stay healthy! And fuck off.

My strategy is literally buy shares that you can afford, slow build on those until you have enough to make safe but profitable options calls. But for the sake of all that's holy learn how options work first if you don't know already. Here's a good video about them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HMm6mBvGKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HMm6mBvGKE)
Just be careful. Some downtowns might legit collapse
My current positions based solely on today’s comments.

PLTR 19.5c 11/20

Well I hope tomorrow is green at least, I’m scared for my 12/18 $165 calls.
Ok
LMAO, had to Google it.
BABA JAN 15 275 strike thank me l8r

Roku fucking popped today and I heard no chatter on WSB
First off, I have only lost money with options, so I'm not good in any way. I can tell you that I stuck with mine for way too long when it was decreasing in value. If you notice that volume is winding down and the price is bleeding, I would get out for now. You have a decent amount of time, so just see where it goes for a few days.

I made the mistake not selling 300$ up. Securing profits will make you happier in the long run. You can always buy again if something substantial happens.
Lmao why is this funny

As scary as all of that is, ask yourself how any of it will affect how much money Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netflix/Google/Microsoft/Tesla make next quarter. That tells you if/how a piece of news will impact the stock market, everything else is noise as far as the market is concerned.

Nov 29 I believe the share lock out ends and when no deal Dec 3 the stock should finally tank under the collective pressure. 
1/15/21 put $2.5 40 buys 4/16/21 $2.5 44 buys. Don’t be a pu$$y!

Didn't know about the 0.13.
HLT and MAR are my preferences if I had to short hotels.  They rely more on business travel and have big international exposure.    Business travel is basically dead and will remain dead due to safety issues and cheapskate corporate budgets. 

That being said HLT seems to have some very high levels of money backing it like Saudi sheikhs who can afford to throw a few hundred million at it.  

But the government (federal) loans all expire on 12/31 and then these hotels will be forced to go draw down their credit lines.

...this isn't a one and done kinda deal... after this we OBVIOUSLY are going to rush back into Robinhood, use tons of social security numbers of dead people to make new accounts, and then pump their numbers to record numbers the next ER.  

Its like this, lets say it IPO's at 50$.  It climbs on Tech B.S.  great first quarter and predictions, goes to 80$ a share, then we fuck em.  Dump everything and leave.  Totally hose them.  Make their ER so bad it plummets into oblivion. Make it like 30$ a share its so bad.  Tell  anyone who doesn't wanna play along to dump ALL their shares during this ER.  

Then, once it hits like 25 a share, everyone buy up as much as humanly possible, swarm into it and let it soar to Tesla valuation levels.  Its perfect.

Well, it just so happens I too have NIO gains, but it didn't hit the funny number today.  I picked up 200 NIO shares when it got to $11.  Now I just write weekly covered calls to NIO tards thinking it's going to moon again.  Either way I win.

Sorry, that's just not true. The total market cap of publicly traded companies has been consistently increasing over time.
Conversion is probably a little wrong, you need to account for the 8:1 multiple vs the ADR then do the currency conversion. Current price i.e
254.2 HKD * 8 * 0.13 (HKD/USD) = 264.368 USD
haha, quality...funny. Basically you repeat 1 of about 10 different one-liners. And if market is up, more bullish comments and the bears are downvoting, if the market is down, more bearish comments and the bulls are downvoting.
Only 3 day trades per week if you have under 25k because it's "too risky"? Holding options overnight is risky af, just let me scalp unlimited times per day and hold cash overnight ffs

I wish pltr would go to 20 so I can get out. IV is dying
Like the previous poster said.. we don't do ethics here. 

As for whether this is good/bad for us as investors... I am long $NIO and this did not make me want to sell. It is just something to consider. So, my assessment in terms of how this affects the picture is that it is a qualified 'good.' I say that, b/c it aligns the interests of NIO with those of the Chinese gov't. Now, the Chinese gov't will protect it's interests when dealing with global EVs such as $TSLA. 

Think of the Chinese gov't like the mafia. NIO is now one of their protected businesses. If names like TSLA want to come in and do business, then China is going to structure things so that their protected businesses will not be harmed, or the harm will be minimal. 

Another way to think about this is that it is in China's interest to form a moat in China around NIO. Having a built-in moat is always good for our investments. However, as with the mafia, if NIO fails to perform for them, there will be consequences, and those consequences will bleed through to investors (pun intended).

The Chinese govt essentially has a lien on NIO's assets, and if they fail to perform, it will be disastrous to us investors. However, I see no reason why NIO would fail to perform.

Actually I figured it out by using the google
High valuations only relative to GDP, maybe GDP is just shit now. Stocks are priced similarly to pre pandemic levels.

I tried told you but you too busy losing money on NIO
What's the diff?
How I used to think:  "The economy is all screwed up, I should buy puts!"

How I think now:  "The economy is all screwed up.  Algos and shady firms are going to try to pump everything up massively before there's a crash."

The latter seems to work much better, as far as financial worldviews go.
Don't worry about it. Just keep making money. Don't chase what ifs
What's the diff?
Asia loves tech. Europe loves cheese.

Agreed! Good to read both sides and adjust based on the actions of those in power.
Did he say what his winners were?
A lot of the vaccine info in this post is fucked up. Expect news of vaccine submission to FDA for authorization as early as tomorrow (Fri Nov 20), and distribution doses are understated here. MRNA vaccine is 2 doses, not 1, etc. 

TL;DR - this guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about re: vaccines
As in selling?
Buy high sell low
I noticed that he was focusing on commercial lending. I think it would have been fair to include retail lending, but that still doesn't make him wrong in this point. Commercial lending is a leading indicator for retail lending.

So BABA is up 3.5% but from what price? According to the chart, it closed at 245 HKD which is around 252.8 USD previous session. It's currently around 262 USD price which is less than 1% of where we closed at. 

I don't know who's following who or whether I'm looking at the pricing incorrectly or not.
BABA is still massively down, can always buy tomorrow or next few days and still make bank.

Primarily low interest rates so borrowing is easy, and my belief that we need to pump money to people to keep small business going. With most (All?) other economies pumping dollars, the US won't want to get a dollar so strong that they cannot sell anything, either.

Either way, I'm just some person on the internet who just doesn't want to hold cash in a savings account.

Deltaone is probably where I saw it too. I was multi-tasking today and that ticker and strike came up. Found time to look at it over lunch. Didn't know about the $120k purchase but it makes sense that there is a whale involved. If there were thousands of people holding a few contracts then it would be because there is a catalyst and it wouldn't be that far OTM. Earnings aren't until January if I'm not mistaken.

Okay, so this is a total noob question, but am I able to "adjust" my option expiration date for a discounted price (ie; not the current market price of that option) because I already own an option for an earlier date?
Hell yeah, buy the JKS dip!!!

I don't know about the other stuff, but MSLP was shit. The vast majority of small businesses don't have an EBITDA because they're not profitable at all yet. If they really wanted to help businesses, they'd have done what the vast majority of lenders do and base what they could fund on revenue. I was surprised they even lent out $25 billion through it. That program showed how out of touch they were at least when it comes to small business.
They tend to feed off each other from what I've been seeing. NYSE seems to have a bigger push though.

If you're making a short term play my #notfinancialadvice recommendations are:

Tesla joins the S&P on Dec 21st. How the market will react, who knows but that's when ETF fund managers must buy in order to track the S&P.

Nikola's IPO lockdown ends Dec 21st. That's when big investors can sell their shares, and given it's widely believed to be a scam it is likely that at least one big investor will hit sell.

Lockdown will end sooner or later in coming months. Oil prices will go back up, and oil companies that are down from Covid will rise again.

Damn. Was hoping it was that weird-lie prick
See, you're thinking too hard. You're thinking about available cash and demand and subprime mortgages. Think first principles; can humans afford to buy homes right now? Something every consumer is expected to buy? No? Then fuckery is afoot. The sign that "shit that used to be affordable for consumers is now unimaginably expensive while the rest of the economy isn't totally collapsing" points to it being a bubble. Something similar is happening with college tuition but on a much slower burn.

Yeah, they would and when you add transaction costs to execute the contracts it just gets even weirder. I don't see the logic behind it. Only thing I can come up with is a fat finger purchase or someone knows something. Even if the option goes up in price because some whale throws out a 45000 x 0.25 sell order (some brokers list the mean of the bid/ask), nobody is buying unless the underlying gets a lot closer to the strike in a very short period of time.

Whats the expectation for TSLA tomorrow? Any actual insight?
Next time lose the money the Wsb way instead of heroin.
I read it, but I think you're off on a few things. First, I don't prescribe to much of what Warren Buffet says because his style of investing worked great for the last industrial revolution but doesn't exactly work for growth investing which has dominated since Web 2.0, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the new interest rate regime, and honestly into the foreseeable future.

Second, the SPY spent Sept-Oct consolidating and put in a double bottom before starting a breakout. If you pull back the chart to weeklies it's very clearly breaking out. Your chart is pretty zoomed, and I think you might be reading too much into the 1% difference between the first and second rejection annotation, especially given the circumstances of the time. I'd say the real takeaway should be the double bottom around \~$320 for SPY.

Quantitative easing being deflationary shouldn't be as big of a deal as it would have been 40 years ago. The largest sectors and market leaders are Tech, and frankly, the rest of the market can go to crap but as long as Tech retains leadership you can still make money from those groups. As a SPY investor, you might not see big gains from the overall market, but that doesn't necessarily mean a major selloff is looming.

Also, I'd point out that cap rates have been extremely low in commercial real estate in the major markets for the past 5 years or so, but I wouldn't say that suddenly the lack of lending to new office or MFH projects is a bearish indicator.

Overall, a lot of this reminded me of the bearish sentiment from old value guys when we emerged from the financial crisis (and they basically struggled for years). The new trend is pretty solidly in place, and while it might be choppy, I wouldn't fight it too hard. Personally, I'm pretty positive that we'll get another grind higher once Nov 20s expiration is behind us followed by the potential for a classic Feb selloff.

Dejavus are actually caused by a glitch in your brain where they attribute something to long term memory instead of short term memory. The moment you are in currently is stored in your short term memory but your brain accidentally draws upon long term memory creating the deja vu feeling.

i'm mostly a PC guy, but PS5 has Demon Souls which is really just a remaster but looks pretty good imo and fun, they did a great job. it also has Spiderman remaster but you have to buy the inferior Miles Morales game.  Xbox has Gamer Pass which has a shit ton of cool games to play so that's awesome.  overall I'd go PC and PS5. but In the end no. I don't think either console has new games worth getting. it's only worth getting a console right now cuz they hard to get. I got the PS5 simply because it was fun trying to get it.

Kind of on the bad side, if you read the article and infer what it's trying to imply.
bought a nice Tissot automatic, wear it everyday, then a year later realized I just should've bought a Rolex since I'll only ever need one watch and I wear it everyday. If you haven't already bought a nice watch, just buy a Rolex and never think about it again.

Im in real estate field.   2008 prices were low due to the financial crisis and mortgage subprime which crashed the markets.   Money Buying right now is pretty clean and no subprime BS.    There is a lot of cash floating around right now and demand is still pretty strong.

I have been invested in Tesla for more than 8 years. I'm surprised it's still below 1T.

If all goes as planned, market cap could reach 20T by 2030 and continue to grow afterwards. Elon gave many hints what's going to happen, many people choose to ignore.

Normally I would heavily discount it. But this is Elon Musk, he tends to deliver. My long term price target is $20k. Those who think $500 is too high will regret down the road.

Yes it works on a daily but then you don't see any trends because it's too zoomed in; I use the 3-month view to get better perspective.  Got out of daily views when I switched to this model.
Even if you miss the first 3% drop, you will catch the next 12% and fuck with that for certain. Turn them gains around and buy a big fat dip.

AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.

Thx papa Powell.
Mortgages will stay low for a long time - maybe not 2.5% low - but even a 4-5% rate isn’t that bad.  Home prices are inflated with the move to suburbs and new construction is overpriced because a 2x4 costs 5 bucks.

Svetlana (Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian Cyrillic: Светлана; Belarusian: Святлана, romanized: Sviatlana; Ukrainian: Світлана, romanized: Svitlana) is a common Orthodox Slavic female name, deriving from the East and South Slavic root svet (Cyrillic: свет), which translates into English as "light", "shining", "luminescent", "pure", "blessed", or "holy", depending upon context similar if not the same as the word Shweta in Sanskrit. The name was coined by Alexander Vostokov and popularized by Vasily Zhukovsky in his eponymous ballad "Svetlana", first published in 1813.

Those that aren't holding PLTR for the super long term, what price are you gonna sell at?
Yes - this is exactly what every investor wants a company to do with their money.  Make mojitos that don't have alcohol in them and spend $1M on a toilet that has more buttons than a TV remote.

Random fact, all money is a form of debt.   So having more debt is literally having more money supply when you are the government.   But having more debt as a person is being broke.  The cards are stacked man.  Might as well YOLO student loan money if you are broke.  If you actually have any money though don't expect a bailout, those are only for bankers and retards.

I think NIO actually looks good now that ER is in the rearview. People won't be talking about it without an event coming up. Shares and Spring ATM calls is my play.

Wait, have you been eating food out the last few months? I have. A lot, I've been tipping bigger, and the people I know who OWN BARS AND RESTAURANTS are doing better than ever. Imagine people with money have more money than ever, and people with money have more time than ever, and people who can skate on unemployment with extra money.

They are all eating out all the time supporting local chow spots... That's not an inflation thing, it's a real thing that happened.

Gonna buy a few March/April SOLO ATM calls at 10:30-11:30 AM, depending on where the stock heads in the morning. Plan to hold for about a week. Maybe less.

Depending on where FCEL opens tomorrow, I'm going to be watching closely. Looks like it was up 5.1% during the day and down 3.17% AH. Hoping it rolls a little further downhill and then  buy some March calls ATM for a quick bounce up next week and sell at +40-60% Gain

Yea I work for mgm resorts in Vegas. Occupancy rates on the weekends are 50-60%, but during the week we're at 17-25%. Its going to be a really rough quarter. This is generally our slow season, but we get through it with a handful of good conventions in October and November, then rodeo in December. The week between Christmas and New Years is generally our biggest week to recover from the slow period, bolstered by tourists coming mainly from Europe and Asia. All those conventions are gone, New Years Eve celebration is cancelled, and I don't see us having that travel into the states from countries that are also locked down. 

We always look forward to January and February, as those are traditionally our biggest months bolstered by some massive conventions, including CES, but those are gone too. March is usually great due to a few conventions+ March madness.

So really, our turnaround might happen in March if March madness isn't completely canceled, and we start to see vaccine distribution in late spring, though I think it will be mid summer at the earliest.

The one thing that MGM does have going for it, it went with an "asset lite" strategy over the last few years, selling the physical land and buildings that the hotels and casinos to a reit, while retaining operations of the casinos. So the MGM has a TON of cash on hand to ride out the storm. Even so, I've been perplexed by the recent upswing in ticker price. 

Just my two cents.
Never heard about gsx

Sounds epic though
I’m trying to figure out why he’s gotta label which mom it is

Or a pump and dump, hey everyone buy my bags!
Is it Chasdaq or Chadsdaq?
The best feeling in the world is selling a put to a random sucker after 3 days of red (or selling a call after a multiple +5% days) and seeing the stock price reverse and decimate the option value.
All I need it to do is graze $50 at some point
This shit is going back to $5 where it belongs
He's caught up in his feelings and can no longer pump. The best you can hope for is that he may lash out at some companies and cause a trump dump.
Why not fuv instead, went up more than solo 69%

Yeah no. In the early days Ant group actually got a lot of preferential treatment from the Chinese central bank.

They like it's payments system very much. They are just concerned with it's CreditTech group (which also happens to be the most profitable part of Ant...) because it's asset backed lending schemes with low % collateral scream of the sort of sub-prime lending shit that blew up in 2008.

After reigning that in Ant valuation will drop some, probably a lot actually but it will IPO just fine and likely moon shortly after.

I normally laugh at dumb bears who get excited with less than 1% drop in FUTURES but I often feel pity for them cuz I cant imagine how desperate one needs to be to get that excited for nothing :(
So I learned all this shit and studied only to realize memes move the market and if you ignore that you will underperform. 

I have performed well this year, but this thought is depressing me and I am thinking of just becoming a cabinet maker.  Hahah these are my true feelings and I can’t tell my wife this...
Not really

1. They were profitable Q3 during the worst travel year ever

2. They’re at 80% of last year bookings right now versus 40% for major hotel chains. So they are more resilient, will have less debt and depressed assets by a huge amount, and they cut their advertising by hundreds of millions on top of it. In other words, they’ve demonstrated a moat against traditional hotels.

3. The new trend is towards booking a larger Airbnb for a week or a month to work from home or vacation away from the city. This has raised the average Airbnb price to over $100 while the average hotel rate is down to around $50

4. Tons of capital on the sidelines looking for new growth stocks to invest in with Apple at ~$2,000 billion valuation there is a lot more upside investing in a housing related company with a multi trillion dollar target market that’s valued at $30-40 billion

5. New Years and the holidays will have tons of bookings so first quarter numbers will be an easy beat
hot take: we already saw it in the spring
We seen this before with the China trade talks. Shit gets bad then it recovers as everyone thinks it’s overblown then 🥭 comes out and takes a big steamy shit on your calls then everyone thinks alright now it’s over and then it gets worse and worse.

My main goal is to blow up 

#and then act like I don’t know nobody
The keg is at 66% of its former value. More over the keg.un is a royalty fund that takes a 4% cut of top line revenues. So it's really just a bet that the keg stays in business and continues to serve customers. 

The fund itself is a bit shit because it has very little growth beyond....a potential 10% dividend going forward..but we won't get into that......

But uhhh yea it's got 30% left to run son....also Canada has rent subsidies and wage subsidies in place until June with kickers on top of ya province is shut down..
Right?!? But if you are like me you will think about how shitty you will feel if you miss the drop that was obviously coming so you go right back to buying puts on six flags like a miserable gay bear

Lol, at least shares of UVXY don't expire worthless. I don't know how you can have enough appetite for risk to buy VXX calls, but not UVXY. In any rate, the trick is all about timing. A strategy that makes timing less of a critical failure is likely to be successful. Which is more sensitive to getting the timing wrong?

If Cohen buys GME, the stock will just be broken for a few days.
Holy shit! That's a hell of a combination of autism and balls. If I had $200k to drop on options I honestly don't know if I could have pulled the trigger on that trade. I mean, even if you move the bid ask from $0.03 to $0.09, where the fuck are going to unload a 1DTE that is $7.00 OTM? AMD needs an 8.1% move to be ITM.

I'm not defending anti-maskers. There is no defense for it. But I'm tired of Midwesterners being labeled idiots by coastal folks who overall fared worse with the disease. Some of that was those states getting hit earlier, but in Ohio DeWine was closing things faster than Cuomo despite having almost no cases. We were told to act responsibily by locking down and most people did. At that time we were sending supplies and workers to New York while they had cases and we really didn't. Now that the reverse happens (although New York now also has thousands of cases daily) some New Yorkers want to shit on the people here as if our ignorance is causing it. It's flaring back up all across the western world.

This pandemic is crushing small business owners financially and kids academically and socially. I think it's fair for people to be tired of the restrictions (not talking mask mandates or restrictions on large gatherings) causing that without being accused of wanting to kill people or being uneducated.
Thanks for sharing. You referring to the Climate Summit on Dec 12?

That's true, but only reason I took away the 0 is because everyone here kept crying that they haven't posted profits in years, and then I instead invested it into PSTH. I had the best entry point too a month ago when it was still below 10. Congrats on the gains man.

\- President refuses to concede election and seems hellbent on burning this mfer down as his term ends

I bought 250 shares this morning at $18.19. Kinda like when I bought NIO at $21, I thought "damn, I wish I would have got in at $4".  But I saw it going into mid-high double digits by the end of the year, if I'm right I double $ or more. If you think PLTR is going to 40 or 50 or whatever, why fret about what you could have done earlier? You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

Man I remember when GTAV first came out and there were rumors that you could affect stock prices by blowing shit up. For example taking out Cluckn' Bell trucks would cause their rival's stocks to increase.

Ad sales can pay well if you’re good. Actual marketing departments are a lot of statistics and building info for dumb workers to understand their own product. Seemed boring , but I was in sales. Now designing ad campaigns could be fun, but I don’t know anything about that.

After today’s news from the treasury I would wait until it falls into the mid $70 range before buying, but It has  a solid balance sheet with $6B liquidity and $1B+ cash on hand. 96% of its properties are occupied and still paying rent. It jumped 27% on the Vaccine news, once the FDA approval of a vaccine is announced it will jump back above $100 and probably trend towards its previous 52 week high in the $150s. Iv is low and leaps are dirt cheap.

He can't force the change he wants as an activist investor either. He's further from that ability actually because now he doesn't get all the strategic info and insider points; he will get what they choose to give him and like all humans he can be manipulated.

Somebody dropped over $200K in one buy when they were $.03 lol. Think it popped up to $.09 after that when I checked

Oof yeah, if you make it past a milly you should really consider moving.
Not sure, but it could still go up of course. Or down. Just an interesting video to watch and if you think it will keep going down then invest in that. I’m just putting the info out there more
I think I saw that a couple days ago.

People on their death bed still saying that it isn't real and that they couldn't be dying from it.

Another electric bus maker, $GPV, has been running up lately. They're delivering about 20 buses per month. Meanwhile, in 2016, Microvast delivered 7500 buses, so average 625 per month. They sell globally, operating in China, the US and Europe. By the way, that 7500 buses is before they even entered the U.S market, which they did in 2017. Think about that for a second. The minute we see some financial disclosures showing thousands of bus sales over the last three years to American cities, this stock will take off. Plus it's chinese which means you know they will be cooking books like a mother fucker. This is actually a good buy. No options available and I don't know wtf warrants are so I'm gonna buy shares. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

ToS dashboard can be customized however you want. Keep your screen as clean as possible so you don't overload yourself with squiggly lines at first.

I'd start with a simple watchlist, chart, order flow, and an option chain window if that's what you're into.
It's all on the profits. If you're really fucking good at options, you can absolutely outperform buy and hold. I do a mix of both, but at the end of the day I sell for profit.

If I have something up 30% and I think it might go up to 35% if I wait 12 months, I sell and re-invest those gains into something else I think will go up 30% and take the short terms gain hit. My 401K can take the tax advantage

My wife is leaving her boyfriend for me and I don’t know how to feel about that CIIC shares
Tanker gang assemble.
Look what happened to wday earnings today with a good report
So glad i legged out on my calls last minute or my cheeks would be clapped tomorrow
I kid. The sector is completely f'd how do you survive without making money for the whole year? But you're not locked in to that area. Manufacturing, transport, and retail are hiring in bulk. It's a situation where beggars can't be choosers sadly.

I propose bulls and bears sign a peace treaty to end our pointless conflict. We must both focus our attentions onto Theta gang. They are the real villians

WHO is a group of clowns.
I mean, obviously circuit breakers not happening anytime soon but can we at least get a -3% day tomorrow? Everyone needs a good dip to buy
Roll it over during a dip. That’s what I did with my 11/20 to 11/27
You're fucking retarded
All the things you mentioned that you may feel are lacking in life give you a benefit of having more time in the day to be productive. Not to suggest being unproductive is inherently bad, but if you are looking to improve in other areas of life, time is your greatest asset. 
Whether it's a hobby, learning a new skill, starting a business (even if it's only for tax benefits), time is something that is traded for friends, girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife, kids, etc.
Me and my nephews are excited.
Options are capital gains as well bud...

Munchkin the bear god.
why do you think itll take that long for vaccine to roll out? just curious.
Yeah seems oddly peaceful. Unemployment benefits start ending in a month so we’ll see then.

It’s a great day when you gain 6% so your only down 83% on the all time
I did it once, I felt gayer than the mods.
It's not bleeding fast enough, I can see this melting up into open
Not until January 15th
Think about it, they're trading at 1/3 - 1/4 of Amazon on nearly all valuation metrics.

They lost around 60b in market cap on the day of the Ant Group snub. Few days later, they generated 73b in sales from Single's day. 

And all Jack needs to do for BABA to regain that 60b market is to suck emperor xi's pp. That's the easiest job in the world for 60b.
I know but I can't help getting older and seeing all my cousins and friends settling down and a voice in the back of my head saying that I want that.
So no stimulus thats why we gonna have circuit breaker
I sold my 12/4's that had been up 300% for 10% profit and bought some weeklies instead, since I wasn't waiting on some catalyst that was coming up anymore and just on a bounce back. Sold half at 100% and got the last ones riding into tomorrow
These two weeks are probably the best for GME. 

Currently holding a bunch of 15c 1/15 and 500 shares. 

Should I use the rest of my buying power + margin and buy few thousand shares?
Why would it move up before the merger?

went a bit heavy on $LUV calls expiring next week. Looking at Munchkin's comment and red af future for dow... should I get out ASAP in the morning?
Hmm thought that was old news and priced in already though. Was there any catalyst? Or just MM’s doing their shit
Probably will happen tonight —-> tomorrow.

Haven’t paid attention to stay at home stocks much. We sure they’ll pop with the drill ?

I know what you mean but like I do have to make it back on the next trade. There’s no other way!
None of those words mean anything to me though. If I sell before the merger, it doesn’t even matter if the company is a complete fraud like Nikola, the share price will simply never go below $10 meaning minimal risk.
How do I prove to you I repay my debt and eat my socks ?

12 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits at the end of the year. No stimmy = no more benefits.
So if you decide not to play options and just buy stock, then sell it after a few months rinse and repeat, you're going to get fucked by capital gains taxes. Is it still a decent way to gain profits?
I truly don't understand why it's such a big deal. I did buy my niece a roblox gift card for Christmas last year. Maybe that's why? Haha. I have no clue what it is but I gave them $100.

PLTR and GIK are on the chopping block. If they print above 15% then I’ll cash them out.

I live in one of the states you listed, in an area that has been largely unaffected by the virus other than small business owners getting fucked.

I don't agree with full on lockdowns. Essential shit needs happen and if manufacturing/retail for non-essentials can be done safely, then I'm all for it.

My gripe comes with the anti-mask morons that still believe this thing is a 100% hoax. They don't consider the economic impact of sick healthcare workers at a time when hospital beds are filling up.

Things aren't going back to normal until we get a hold of the virus. Doesn't matter if 50% of the country could give a shit, it's still gonna affect them in one way or another.

Might as well get it over with instead of protesting the right to fresh air in the Walmart aisle.
Save the money you would spend renting for a down payment on a home or condo.

Take it from a guy who’s won big and lost big.. try to be a little less greedy bruv. 

You can only blow up your portfolio so many times before you throw in the towel. There’s way too much money to make to be thinking that you have to make it all back on the next trade.

Wait, does everyone "sort by new" these threads? Just making sure. It reminds me of a chat room.
Do people actually buy ITM calls? Lame as fuck if you ask me
Well, you’re not wrong.
You can refinish the counter tops for a couple hundred bucks and they come out fairly decent looking.  I needed something to cover that freaking 80's pink formica until I finished up with other projects around the house.  Been around 3 years and it seems to be holding up pretty well.

That would be incredibly stupid, you'd better hope it dips to 474 or lower. If it dipped to 380, you'd walk away with millions, 20 million+ according to optionsprofitcalculator.com.
Hoping this will continues tomorrow. Healthy competition to SBE/ChargePoint.

once it breaks 10 i think itll be picked up by more institutions and we'll see it rally from that news. vaccine news keeps pushing it along, that variable has me concerned though with how sour it could be if we hear that the vaccines are being pushed back or etc. i think a lot of boomers that have GE in their portfolio would have already sold with the past month increase of like 30%.
A lot of raunchy penis memes and gay slurs back in the day, e.g. - "phaget".
About 25%, and hopefully big tomorrow
Thought the stock was dead.

Yeah and even he acknowledged it'd be anywhere from a 2-12 month timeline before the bubble bursts. It's not going to be next month when the vaccine gets approved

It wasnt easy to find and the market isnt over priced in that area. Guy was asking 65k but got him down to 30. I personally wouldnt live there by choice now just based on the area. Saying that, i grew up poor, even lived in a trailer park, so i dont mind being a bit picky when i can. It was a 1300 sq/ft 3bd 1bf SFH built in the 60s. Needed new roof, windows, paint inside and out, carpet, gutters and flashing, some interesting electrical issues and a few other minor things. I think i couldve got 90-95k out of it but it was the beginning of the pandemic and i was unsure of where the market was going to go. I still made a nice profit that id take and day of the week

>I'm not gonna ask her, but if I had to imagine what she'd say, it would be "There's about to be another housing bubble, invest in something that isn't tied to real estate."

Would you mind confirming with her that info and why?  I would truly appreciate it.
Have you learned your lesson?
Us was up like 1% with after market. 

In hk it's 2.7%
Sure. 

It's bad. Low rates are a product of an unhealthy economy. In a strong economy you have higher rates which helps reduce overspending or lending. 

Since the 1970's America lost its collective mind. Everyone thought they were going to be billionaires. So the typical safeguards that were in place (social and economic) went by the wayside as people tasted some of the good life. Of course alot of this was through borrowing (see national debt as a percent of gdp).

Fast forward and you started to see insane behavior. People with $60k jobs buying $500k homes because that kind of economic activity benefited the rich (they took their fees and sold to the poor) while they slowly started decimating the job force (first blue collar jobs and then slowly good paying jobs).

2009 happened when the first wave collapsed. Bottom line was people couldn't pay back what they owed because I ye continual need to lend and spend was imbalance by labor still taking too much of the pie. The 2009 recession destroyed housing partly in places like florida and arizona because the jobs that supported it didn't need to exist anymore and with a better educated population there was too many people for what little labor demand remained. That fueled the gig stuff and generally speaking alot people never came back

Instead of responsible monetary policy the fed kept rates low and policymakers flooded the system with cash, there was less overhead and regs and no rate hikes for a while. People overborrowed again even through the same problems of 2009 were never addressed. Add in a unhealthy and aging population and things were getting worse.

But still loans were handed out like candy even thought no one needs 8393939 dynamic seasoned professionals.

Things were still stable in part because there wasn't a shock to the system and the fed cut rates last year.

Then corona hit and the entire system fell apart. And it fell apart in a week because it relies purely on present credit and labor. Both got taken away quick

Then congress decided to flood the system with cash and the fed decided to reduce rates to zero, backstop MBS etc.

People saw that and took advantage of cheap credit.

See the problem?
An interesting factor in the PM Mining Space is that Gold and Silver discoveries are way down.  The time necessary to permit a new mine is also way up - and getting exponentially more difficult.  These factors bode well for the Supply conundrum.  Additionally, ETF buying is now putting supply balance in to negative territory.  Hopefully, my prediction holds true but I only need Silver at $50 to make a few million.
Vaccine eua in 2 weeks will do it. Flat until then.
This COVID shit sucks. I was somewhat of a social butterfly up until like February, and now I feel kinda similar to you. A lot of people's personalities changed over the last 9 months, like people who had been cheerful and social for the last 10 years now are completely different people.

Collectively, nobody has anything to look forward to so people are deciding to settle down. I usually only keep open-minded people in my social circle, and somehow all the people I've surrounded myself during the last couple years don't even see past the tip of their noses anymore.

I am confused. So let's say the stock price is down by 5% tomorrow, then his options are ITM. So that leaves him with two options. Either sell them or exercise them. I don't think he is rich enough to exercise them. So, that leaves him with selling the options. So, what if his bid price is less than the ask price, then there is a possibility he will manage to sell all of them by making decent profits. What am I missing here ?

I am also working on my feelings. Bought 40 shares of TSLA  at $250 presplit and when I went to reload my financial adviser said an additional 60 would imbalance my portfolio. So I now have 200 instead of 500. Fuck, I hate being a retard with small testes.

Bubbles would never exist if not for convincing narratives. It's sort of a fucking prerequisite, not proof to the contrary you smooth brain mongoloid. You think shitcoin went to 20k originally because it didn't have an equally convincing argument as the one you just laid out (which btw, for it to drive a bubble the argument has to be simple enough for a trout to formulate so thanks for the megabrain insight). Bubbles gonna bubble, the narrative doesn't matter, anyone who debates that this is a bubble is too young to have seen one or delusional.

I still stand by my reasoning that it was the 20% uh oh that changed his mind. It wasn’t until Christmas Eve that they signaled a willingness to halt rate hikes and we reversed that day and then that led to the whole “mid cycle adjustment”. 

Btw, just crept your profile thinking i was arguing with some kid who just downloaded RH after March. Realized you’re the dude with the 1m+ SPY short pre pandemic. You were early, but props. I was wondering what happened to you. Fucking maniac.

In these times, it is not even unthinkable, although it makes one wonder why some people chose to start the game as a tunisian slave in antiquity but maybe the game only works chronologically, they might have time trapped in a server and they can’t control it.

Nah they pretty much wrapped up that story. I think if they do another Red Dead it will be set in the golden age of the wild west (1870s) and may have Dutch and gang as background characters, but the main character will be different.

Wait wut?
Your summer job? Are you even old enough to trade? 3 months at minimum wage is like $3.7k. I promise you losing $3.7k is not the worst decision of your life. That's less than I paid to help my GF out with her car crash that someone else caused.

I'm down $40k YTD, but my options acct low was $250 in august and I'm back to $8k without reloading. If you learn and stick around you might learn some good shit. 

Otherwise take this as a lesson about the value of wage cuckery and study for something that pays big baller dollars since it sounds like you're in school. Yes you can do the hard majors. I was a history major and got a 3.8GPA in my CompSci master's degree.

Today was weird. A lot of conventional stocks were still going up like resorts/casinos,  retail, and cruise lines. At the same time work from home shit has been going up, especially hard today with TWLO, ETSY, and WORK.

I think the guy doing DD on MGM puts is right. The casinos and leisure shit is hitting its peak for now and the workfromhome ETF is almost at its ATH and I think it goes even higher

Bought RIOT leaps yest at 9:31am and stock instantly dropped 20% that was funny
 "**Thanksgiving is cancelled"**

No, Covid is cancelled in like 70% of the country's mind. Thanksgiving flights bookings were way up. 

I am not buying any of these stocks but I'm also not betting against them. Calls on Covid cases and more irrationality among the American people.
I don't think you understand how much money there is going to corporations. They're getting TRILLIONS to boost the stock market and keep companies from going out of business. Which is just ridiculous, companies that cant afford to stay afloat should go out of business. Just like what's happening to middle class Americans. The poor are benefiting, the rich are benefiting and the middle class is getting fucked. 

America could give EVERY American $2000 a month for the next 3 years and we'll spend less than we spent the last 6 months to keep corporations afloat. Let that sink in.

 \- He met many people that believed on him and invested on his ideas.

The fact is, you don't know what kind of power dynamics were happening behind the scenes. You don't know how it affects Powell's decision making when he sees headlines about the president wanting to fire him for not doing his will.

For example, if the president were instead saying "steel the course, don't mind the markets," we may not have seen rate cuts in 2019.

I completely get why you’d like their product. I’d like their product. Doesn’t mean what I want is what a tiny fraction of a majority would want or would afford.
Wish I had the answer to that!  There is a lot of speculation that the earnings will be very good and send the price higher, but who knows how the market will react.  Maybe buy  some tomorrow and again if there is a dip after earnings?  We had a 6% drop yesterday and I bought more before the huge run today, so just be patient and pick your spots. Good luck!
DDD
You’re right. 15k on 45c tomorrow at open.
I hope so. I’m hoping for an ANT revival announcement.
Jesus, 2k square foot absolute shitholes in my area (Minneapolis suburbs) would still cost well north of $150k... And those would literally be unlivable (unless it was a condo I guess?)

Yeah I got shares and January's left. BABA not being able to go up, what was it, 2-3% to satisfy my weeklies was a big shocker. RIP $3000. Keep the target reasonable and at least a month away and calls seem very doable.

I'm not over the moon with either as a long term investment yet, but CIIC has more "energy" right now, like, as a "up and coming" meme stock. No options in CIIC though. I don't like it enough to dump a large sum in for a possible less than impressive return, but, I'm just another stoned autist that doesn't understand the stock market. So 🤷‍♂️. Have a nice night???
Boy that penis sure is embarrassing for you
Just to fuck you over imma pour an extra 100 mill into shares :)

Nah this is fallacious. Other countries are literally giving their populous 2k a month per person. We're actually going to be far ahead because many countries are functionally bankrupt now. Several countries are legit out of money because they exclusively rely on the usa to be not locked down. People forget every other country has the same problem as the usa. In fact since a lot of us don't really give a shit about the pandemic we're unintentionally causing herd immunity allowing us to open faster. Europe, asia, africa and middle east are now going through what we went through a few months ago. Many people predicted this including myself. For example, canada has gained more debt in 1 year than the entire time of it's existence. Their money might as well be monopoly money.

And you can't really fuck with mortgages. Absent a massive stimulus and forbearance forever low rates isn't going to help.

Someone has to pay the principal + insurance + taxes. And guess what? local governments are full of well paid workers. They aren't going to take pay cuts and their union contracts plus local debt needs to be paid. So taxes go up. And no one is spending money which would flow through to them.

So expect property tax defaults which means lenders will step and put the mortgage in default and suddenly there isn't any money flowing back.


Cutting rates to zero was the same as pouring gas on the economic fire.

I'm as bullish as a person typically gets, but the Mnuchin news will definitely spook the markets a bit.

can someone explain this in WSB language?

"S&P is small up on the day and expiration is coming up tomorrow. Note the big gamma around 3600, capping upside potential as long gamma dealers will be very happy to get this moving either way, but lot of supply should we head higher.

On the other hand, dealers are sick of bleeding theta here, so cheap upside exposure coming up."

How far does this go?

Is it like saying retard too much (guilty), or literally bringing up "tendies, FDs, gay bears" multiple times in normal conversation?
Lol this is great and you went balls deep into your position, bravo.

I just wanna add that the market seems like it's simultaneously forward-looking but also overreacts to things in the short term. It kinda fucks with my head, but I agree that things appear to be a tad too bullish about our recovery prospects. This already happened once back in June, when the initial outbreak started to decline. Medical experts already anticipated worsening conditions in the Fall/Winter, but it didn't matter until it did.

I suspect Covid has already mutated into different strains at this point and I wouldn't be surprised if the vaccines end up being about as effective as the flu shot is, which could dump its efficiency down into the 40-60% range.

Yeah, I tried that too. But the penalty for the year was almost 10% which was a huge gut punch after federal and state is included. You’ll be looking at close to 45% of gains depending on how much you make in your normal job. Maybe the math works out, but I find the smaller quarterly checks are easier to write lol.
Expedia had Barry Diller step in and sack management before Covid hit.  Their expenses were out of control and as a company they just weren't focused or executing.  They will come out of this much leaner, more focused, and more importantly, more profitable with leaner overhead.  Weird as it is, it probably is worth more now than it was in February.
Um, hm, I guess that would make too much sense.  I might consider trying to rinse and repeat in the a.m.
Short means sell . For example, short put would mean selling a put. They are different
That's literally what they doing. They're cannot cover the unlimited no interest loans they're printing. So basically in a few years the dollar is going to be a shitty currency compared to other world currencies.

Tesla is ranked 12th, BRK.A ranked 11th. Once it surpasses BRK.A, BABA is next to crack top 10.
word. I have been playing weekly and occasionally  monthly short puts, all cash covered. 

If you're looking for a good company to write puts on at the moment, take a look at TREE. Rated highly by analysts at Merrill / CFRA, who have been very accurate thus far during the pandemic bull run. 

I wrote 12/18 240p this afternoon after they'd fallen another 5%. For no particular reason, I do think TREE will reach 240 around Dec 31.

I generally like the play.  I had LVS shares and calls but got out a bit too early when it crossed $52.  Because it's changing its focus to Singapore and Macau and trying to sell Vegas I don't want to buy puts for the slight dip it will likely take on the inevitable pullback, but MGM remains a stretched company that was just starting to re-org when Covid hit.  Horrible, horrible timing for them.

A couple of things to consider:  There will likely be a stimulus pop.  Maybe more than one.  The Presidential contest becomes less important by the day and members of Congress know that they're all being blamed for inaction.  Believe it or not, they're sensitive to that.  Both parties.

BUT, I think you're missing a bigger downside catalyst:  Conventions.   Vegas makes its money on convention traffic.  The holidays you mention that they're going to lose are gravy.  They're going to be missing the main course for almost another year.

Conventions have long lead times for planning/logistics of all involved.  Most of the big ones have cancelled into next summer.  Even if everyone is vaccinated by April, I doubt you really see conventions come back full force for over a year.  Zoom will replace a lot of this corporate expense.

I'll start watching for an entry point for puts (and for my comfort level, a little longer time horizon).  Good write up.   Best of luck, and thanks.
You’re either delusional or thick. Not even a year ago Trump was trying to “fire” Powell for not cutting the fed funds rate to 0.

Depends on your interests because he hosts a huge range of people. I like all 3 of Alex jones’ episodes, Russell brand, Tom segura/ari shaffir/bert Kreischer, Joey Diaz, Rhonda Patrick, Sam Harris, Bill Burr, Ben Shapiro (sorry not sorry), Jordan Peterson
You are fully showing the extreme.

As with the price rising, funds that own Tesla now will go above their holding %, like ARK did recently and will have to sell some. This will create more of a float that isn't being accounted for. It's not like everyone will hold, but we will most likely have a big spike(s) at points for seconds to minutes I feel like.
Sadly I was too much of a pussy to pull the trigger on Tesla.
Saw it at 435, dropping towards 430, and I thought, ''If it hits 430, I'll go in for a few shares''.

*Spoiler alert, it never reached close to 430.
Not everyone can have a big pp like us
Just the beginning
Optionscalculator.com
Decide your exit before buying, whether that’s 20%, 50% or 300%. Have a plan and don’t be afraid to take a small loss because that money would be best used on another contract. You’d be better off to buy your contracts at least a week out, I could go on and on lmao but I’ll leave it there for now. Best of luck

A watched future doesn't tank.
Look for stocks that are hot but not overbought (GRGW). Look for stocks that historically do well but are currently under performing in current market (think TSLA and BABA last week). Stay away from stock where retards are are buying absolutely gigantic leaps based on current markets (NIO). Look for trend down and try to time jumps (SE). Current market is boomer vs millenial stocks (cruise lines vs zoom)
Ok we get it ...Tesla has " Red Rocket Energy" !
Amazing how credit suisse just upgraded NIO to $55 wow we should all buy it and become rich!

SPCE will never make any money until 2050. They want to charge rich people 250k for 5 minutes of terror in the stratosphere, great business model you have there. It’s a retarded meme stonk with no real value whatsoever. That being said, I’m in.

I'll take 10%.
I've been trading 20+ years and have >$5mil.

Honestly, we probably trade flat tomorrow.  They're not going to let your 0DTE TSLA 500c print and they definitely won't let your puts that you picked up at the top print
Horrible stonk shorting it to the ground

AYRO makes sense. SOLO does not.
So I bought myself an Oculus Quest 2 the other day.  Love the thing.  However, what I really want to do is jerk off to some really decadent VR porn.  This poses a problem as I’m unsure of my ability to get hard bc of the thought of my wife walking into the room while I’m frantically jerking off to interracial midget porn with my vr goggles on and totally oblivious to her presence.  

In sum, MSFT 230 12/18 call.

At Trump’s level? What the fuck are you talking about? What level? The retard level where you owe so much money to so many powerful people. Is that his level? He’s a broke ass puppet who could be making a complete disappearing act after he leaves office.
“There’s no evidence of that happening at all” you said

Then I point to one of the dozens of articles discussing that 75%+ of his remaining short list candidates are women.

You conclude there is “no evidence”

Hey Scotland born and bred. Bring it!!!
You're looking at the situation wrong. Without these crash predictions, retail traders would be way too bullish and that's when "they" will allow the market to crash. As long as a good number of people think it'll crash, it likely won't.

I'll probably get 1.5+ mil when my parents die if they died today. But I actually would rather get rich(er) on my own with them alive. They are 73 (dad) and 72 (mom) and are both in excellent health and could last another 20 years. And I hate that most of my money is because they set me up for it. It's not about being ABLE to retire at a normal age like 65. It's about not spending another GD moment in my retarded job that pays me too much (undeservedly) to be horribly pedantic. So I can spend my time hunting for fossils,  meteorites, gold, sailing, and on my ultimate goal of finding an exoplanet.

Is TSLA mooning or dropping tomorrow?
I don't think that a person's financial situation should be used to judge if they deserve success or not. This applies to both rich and poor. Now, the fact that a certain person who happens to be a billionaire creates solutions that improve people's lives is something that deserves encouragement. However remember that Musk only got there due to all the lucky strikes he had during his life. In reality many people who are as or more smart and have as good or even better ideas than he does never get the chance of seeing them being executed due to their lack of lucky.
I wouldn't be upset if I hold it medium-long. The "quick" in my thinking was that, ideally, what I perceive as a really strong sell-off will recover quickly.

According to investopedia: "The Fed can indeed create money "out of thin air." To be more precise, it does so with keystrokes on a computer. This was illustrated with its QE program, also known as open market operations. That's when the Fed buys an asset from a financial institution and pays for it with money it simply creates.

Steve Meyer, a senior advisor to the Fed's Board of Governors, explains how this is done. “You may wonder how the Fed pays for the bonds and other securities it buys," he says. "The Fed does not pay with paper money. Instead, the Fed pays the seller’s bank using newly created electronic funds and the bank adds those funds to the seller’s account.”"

Harry Reid saved them from the banks that time. A break up of the near monopoly would have been healthy for Las Vegas. It’s stagnated because everybody pegged themselves to the biggest player. 

If you attempt to compete with them they take out massive a loans to buy you out. Mandalay Resorts or whatever it was called is an example.

You can’t tell me that the bear post on the front page is not a blatant lie to get people to buy his shitty puts, look at his past DD. He says we are crashing hard 20 days ago and we all know what happened through the election: HULK COCKS. These big bear bois come and go and get thousands of bloodthirsty followers and more often than not get completely cucked. Look at the fall of the great Variation Separate and all the tards who thought SPY was going to 200 in April.

Probably not, unless volume increases. I've had mine for a month and there have been plenty of catalyst events, but it just drops back. Very unfortunate

It would easily be in the 90s-100s if it wasn't for the merger weighing it down!
I think that is probably a poor strategy. BABA isn't likely to moon quickly. It will be a slow grind back up. A completely legit long term move but for short term plays there are better on offer.

You're very certain. Are you playing this through spreads or pure puts?
Just a thought, what if they aren't actually printing any money? Like what if they're just telling us they are and putting down that they are? How would we know if they control anything? Have they ever printed anything during this pandemic at all? Wouldn't telling us but doing nothing have the same effect?

True. Liiiiite coin exists in a grayscale ETF as 0.1 per share, and is currently trading at about $8 for that 0.1. Yet LTCN is at $275. I was going to short it at $245 and wasn't allowed because it's an OTC security. But the sheer fact that it even went up dumbfounds me yet your point here is proven quite nicely

From 60 minutes interview:
PELLEY: Fair to say you simply flooded the system with money?
POWELL: Yes. We did. That's another way to think about it. We did.
PELLEY: Where does it come from? Do you just print it?
POWELL: We print it digitally. So as a central bank, we have the ability to create money digitally. And we do that by buying Treasury Bills or bonds for other government guaranteed securities. And that actually increases the money supply. We also print actual currency and we distribute that through the Federal Reserve banks.
Buy leap puts then

Your Tesla call expires in 7 days, your NIO call expires in a few weeks.  I think Tesla is going to keep climbing with new valuations and eventually drop a bit to find it’s spot, that said I wouldn’t sell unless it hits 550 or wait until mid day spike the day before expiration.  Nio will keep pushing you have a lot of time, hold it.

Yep, tech lookin all good
Of course I don't but I also don't want to miss the rise in the mean time.  If I go up 20% before the correction i would be effectively flat.

May be time to tone down big call bets and shorter the horizon.

Maybe stoplosses at like 7.5% on stable stocks like Amzn, Aapl etc and actively sell if the whole market goes red.

Damn hard to time puts on tech and dangerous as they could run for a while.

VIX /VXX may work, but it could be a slow bleed and not a rapid crash which wouldn't increase the volatility and make those bets not pay off.
I personally would not be stressed if I had that call. Tesla is on a moon mission from now till s&p induction

If they ever show up on stage. Maybe they're using this time to talk over past issues they want to move on from.
look at the 1 day SPY chart

we are in a downtrend, at the very least a temporary one

you can't predict events that easily but it's not hard to look at RSI on a 1 day chart and see it's overbought and the same thing happened the past 2 months, just different news

question is whether it continues or rebounds, down immediate term is a near certainty
I thought I saw the 13f for renaissance last week. Figured that’s when it would’ve moved.

The math equation is $10 + $999,990 - $999,400. Theres a -$999,400 factor there so it technically happened. But yes, he net gained $590.

I fomoed that shit today dummy
From what I understand (and I’m just another idiot on WSB) tickers that have options that trade on 5¢ increments can execute at odd prices but only as a part of a spread or if the broker allows market price options trades. So that 209 ask volume you see is probably not all asking 0.05, there are likely a lot that are asking 0.01 or 0.02, and those will get filled before yours, because RH doesn’t allow market option trades.
We should probably work on your insults.

There are three main types of investors here, in order of popularity:

Momentum: These are the investors who simply ride trends very, very hard through surprisingly low stakes betting. What happens is they bet far OTM (1SD+) (cheaper) and longer-dated (safer) options calling them YOLO when in fact they are simply setting up trades that actually tend to be profitable.

Contrarian: These are the investors who see value somewhere and put their money there then publicly post about it. Not to be mistaken for actual value investors these individuals usually have the spotlight when they are correct and almost surely fade into obscurity when they are wrong. You don't get many of these this year but perhaps back in 2018 you had a lot more of this type of behavior where someone would give an excellent explanation of why they were doing what they were doing and in some cases it was brilliant and in others it was not.

High-Stakes: These are investors who buy calls and puts that are very short DTE, very directional, and almost always backed by "a gut feeling" or historical performance. 90% of the time it ends horrifically. Despite being the least popular overall this year this is most of the individuals here; lots of people who never have done this before show up, buy weeklies (or two weeks because they are "safe"), and tend to pay almost no attention to things like IV, couldn't tell you any Greeks other than "Delta" and "Theta" and rarely if ever can explain anything about them accurately. They are either mostly asking others what to do or have no idea how to even do basic diligence and understand what a company does.

So despite the place being filled with "retards" a lot of smart people used to hang out here until the High-Stakes crew took over. They will likely hang out for two or more years in cycles because that's how long these weird market aberrations tend to last, and then you'll get back to the top two.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Basically this is a "board" for momentum investors.

I think this flu season will be pretty mild. There will be more people wearing masks (though masks may not make much of a difference in flu transmission) than ever before and all the talk of vaccines might encourage more people to get a flu shot. Plus, there are expected to be more school/office closures. 

We shall see, though. I am certain that COVID is going to be real shitty for the next couple of months at least.

I imagined you putting up two fingers, then realizing what you had done, and lowering one.
I just got an offer with SNAP started working there a few days ago. They included a $700k worth RSUs over 3 years vesting monthly. Scared I got in at ATH because they take a 20 trading day trailing avg to allocate share count. Got ducked because the jump from 28 to 40 happened exactly at that point.
Ah yes, like how AMZN and TSLA have “competitors”

I normally would like the idea of hedging with IWM puts, but IWM has had a weaker recovery than SPY or obviously QQQ so I wonder if puts in another index would be better
Buyer power? Yeah, the institutions that own nearly all of this are out of buying power. They're probably maxed out on their rh/tos margin already smh

I can’t find that anywhere, I’ve been holding them for months. I have 100 shares or so and I’m down $60 but I have a lot of faith in the company. The concept is awesome, check out their website. They offer a membership that’s month to month for their cars, it comes with insurance and maintenance. They haven’t announced the price but it is going to be less than $900 a month.
Fucking right. I have 4 and can’t ever hear them
That's the spirit of wsb.

Not sure about municipalities in particular, but my comment, as well as the one in the article, was regarding increasing the gap between big money and small people
Sure, but he kept doubling down even after the Fed intervention... he was right in the sense that pretty much everyone who knows economics 101 would have predicted how fucked we were. But feds are a real thing, they stepped in back in 08, so to say he was right until fed came in is absolutely fucking brain dead pointless isn’t it

Do they? Let me guess, you just heard "they are backed by the ccp" on Reddit.

NIO does not have the government's support, it is only backed by Hefei, a second tier city.

Nobody drives NIO in China, BYD is much more popular. Even TSLA is more preferred
What do you disagree with them on?
I’m almost completely numb to it now. See my other comment in this thread about losing almost 82k, and that isn’t even the first time my account’s been blown up. If I lost it all again I’d feel almost nothing. I know it ain’t right but it’s how it is.

I’m not gonna pretend like I’m experienced or more advanced or even *successful* in the past but well there’s an aggressive growth strategy right there.
Or at least until there’s a competitor

I come here to have my confirmation bias challenged. 

I filter out 90% of the screaming voices and allow my thoughts/plans to be challenged by differing perspectives. I not only try to avoid my own mistakes, but am reminded daily by the life-crippling mistakes of others.

I see little league batters swinging for the fences at every at-bat instead of getting on base by any means. I'm willing to lean into a pitch to get on base. That's how you manufacture runs.

When I get the itch to try for FU money, I read loss porn here. Then I go back to churning out a few hundred a day writing covered calls and cash secured puts. The last six months have been steady and rewarding.

Shorter-dated options increase in value faster, and there is no way this takes until 2022.

But honestly how can this go tits up? If it’s a shitty merger I just sell potentially at a small loss before the ticker change and I go on my way. Am I missing something? Why isn’t everyone loading the boat on this spac?
PLTR long hold, that’s gonna be a $200 stock
I’m sure they won’t. Same shit was being said in August. Even the news today both sides had to backtrack and essentially say Schumer was talking out his butt. It seems they’re talking about government funding and maybe had a side conversation about it and that’s about it

Lol, I sold 24 352 puts for $500 that were worth $3000 this morning and bought Tesla calls.  I held puts everyday the last week and a half, almost, and finally gave up

Enlighten us
Is PLTR gonna vaporize me if I don't go all in?
Oh shit!
/ES at -0.61%
Then it trades sideways and you both go bankrupt. Two retards with one stone!
I actually agree with you. The market has never seen something squeeze with such a massive short interest. Nobody knows the top. People have these bitch ass price targets at $30-$50. 

With this high short interest? Get the fuck out. Anything under $100 would disappoint me.
PROUD BULLS STAND BACK AND STAND BY

Can you post the one you’ll buy if GME doesn’t pull it off?
Has anyone looked at NAKD. it’s a penny stock I know but over a BILLION shares traded today. WTF. Didn’t even know that could happen
Nah bro he bought a bunch of put calls didn't you read?
HYLN?
I dont know man, Kylie X Grinch sold out within 3 hours
NIO mooning. Their new car looks sick
they bombed their earnings and missed revenues. fuck

BABA has a 10% stake in them, and they're at lows, so i bought
People are going to look back and regret how they knew about PLTR when it was under $100 and didn’t buy
How much are you going to lose tomorrow?
Inverse this strategy everyone.
Why would anyone want a 1 seater though? You can forget about taking a partner out in one of those let alone going on road trips with friends and it's got next to no storage.

It would be one thing if it were in the lower-mid 4 digit range but it's 20k per car. For that price I'd want something that I'm going to keep for 5-10 years. And fundamentally this car makes no sense for the next decade of anyone's life unless they plan on being single, friendless, and not popping out a single child for the next 5-10 years.
You dumbshits realize Joey B’s treasury will just reinstate the Fed “bazooka” less than a month after it expires. This  is a waste of time and thought.

It’s easier to make kids spend than parents.

Sure, parents would most likely limit their kids access to money, but their kids are in the end allowed to spend. There are those who can’t, but who said you need everyone to be your customer to be profitable?

Higher probability of revenue but with a ceiling. The shortcomings of this model is amortized when you have a large audience. 1 dollar from each of 1 million people makes 1 million dollars, for example.

no evidence there will be heard immunity.  Its mutating really fast because of how many people are getting it
I'm somewhat comforted that there isn't some grand conspiracy out to get us, at least that we know of. For a while I was slightly paranoid that the "smart money" actually did flee the market in August and September, and retail was left holding the forever bag.

Well the market bounced, hit ATHs, and now even XLE holders have been given an exit point if they wanted. We're all in this together.
Constituents on both sides are starting to get pretty fed up. Dems know that they lost house seats because of their stonewalling, and Schumer and Mitch have to think about the upcoming Senate races. No stimulus helps no one at this point. I'm sure they'll compromise.
For a retard like you it is

Who else though TSLA was going to 520 at least and didn’t sell calls
Yeah but the other cars don't seem to be available yet. 

If they survive the next few years to begin producing those they could be in good shape. We'll see.
Hmmm, so puts dated after lockup should be free money right? I know NKLA has some sort of retard strength but surely the insiders know enough to dump it asap?
We would need a -10% dump to be on a reasonable level... doubt it will happen

Back in September after NVDA had that RTX event, I was talking a shit at work and without even thinking about it, put my whole account into calls for the day after.

I made like 9k dollars the next day on that alone and after I sold it I didn't even feel anything. I just wanted to put it in something else as it I could just leap frog these piles of money to try to get a higher score.

I put most of it in 1 month apple calls and we all know how that went.

Short answer: yes
There's zero chance a mail courier service is going to buy those in bulk at that price. There's little to no benefit to them doing that, the utility of such a tiny car is minimal to DHL.

How often do you see compact DHL vehicles driving around?

Odds are they're going to buy maybe a few for PR purposes but stick to larger vans and trucks for the bulk of their fleet. Maybe even hop on board some larger EV.

I was part of the contractor crew that turned dollar trees into dollar general. Every single job went about double over budget because their people are retarded and don’t know how to manage IT work. Parts weren’t sent on time half the jobs so we just sat in a hotel out of state on double salary and shit like that. And we had electrician crews straight up smoking weed in the middle of the store not working even after complaining to corporate about the company 

Basically management is dumb and those 17,000 stores weren’t as good for the company as it sounds

I said it’s unique Becuase you said not even Volkswagen went up that much in terms of %. But whatever. we know that GME has a very low float, most of it is locked up by institutions. 140% of shares are sold short, Literally some shorts own fake shares that don’t even exist. If you want, you can compare it to OSTK, which was 70% short and squeezed from 15 to 130, but that was a longer squeeze, I’m expecting a quick one. If Cohen puts out a tender offer for GME and it’s voted yes by shareholders, all the shares lended out by institutions gotta be recalled, shorts will scramble to cover, but most of them won’t even be able to cover day one, since they don’t even have real shares borrow. There would be a fail to deliver shares, and it’d just be madness. They would be forced to buy at insanely high bids and drive up the price. KBIO was a similar situation, Shrekli bought the company and borrowed shares had to be recalled. That caused a 10k% squeeze, and I believe that was also about 70% short. Also, insane amounts of calls will be bought and MM’s will have to buy more shares to hedge. GME is the most short sold stock in history by a long shot, it’ll do wild things, you can’t gauge the situation, that’s why my PT is unreal

Yeah not having read too much about Moderna it seems weird that they're different. 

RNA is notorious for degrading all the fucking time, I remember doing RNA extractions n school and having to spray the shit out of everything with RNAse away.

My question would be if this requirement is different because of actual differences in the drug or if it's just Pfizer being more conservative with their stability data.

This is me just nit picking... Overall agree with everything you laid out, bravo!

Regarding premise 3 I would just say that the Fed has already broken the law by purchasing corporate bonds. They side stepped the law by using a SPV and Black Rock.

It's not inconceivable that the Fed, with the help of Congress because it will be seen as necessary, can pull a Japan and start buying stock ETF's (if I'm not mistaken it's already in the contact with Black Rock that they can do so).

I like this DD for a couple reasons that op missed. First of all why are we posting a DD on a company consistently posting net loss? Because the money they owe is planned to be paid off with this IPO. So how does the future look for them? Telos reported revenue from sole sourced government contracts. This is gravy for them that they can probably keep riding. If the contact isn't bid that means it's recurring so they could have this revenue guaranteed for years to come (could be 10+). Short term this company has some issues hopefully the IPO can help out with but they look similararly solid to PLTR for a long stock. No calls buy shares and hold.
Same - Sold my 42.50 calls last week just under the high at $53 for a nice 205% gain, then watched it tank to 41 and bought the rest of my position with some of those profits, it was glorious!

Yup! Picked it up on the 16th when everyone thought the vaccines meant the end of Zoom. 

12/4 $412.5c
probably too illiquid for him to get out before today without tanking it. 

I fucked with pinksheets in high school, won big like 300% return (as 16 year old, mad weed). .18 to .72, half my shares were filled in 50s as I sold with the other 2 shareholders. Never touched it again. Risky but more importantly slow. Would anyone do scratchoffs if you had to mail in the winner and wait for $3 check? Or a nickel slot machine with a 5min cool down? 

FDs, you know by 3pm if it was a good or bad week
Yeah I’m a bit older (28) than you and one of my biggest regrets was listening to the “it’l look like you change job too fast” comment. Had an opportunity to join a private equity firm but turned it down to stay in the Finance department of a big public company. Lost a huge opportunity and haven’t had as good of one since. But your parents are much more successful than me so who knows.
13k>18k>3k>23k>250>2.5k> All in 11/20 356p.

Lol. Hope so. MGNI could be the clearing house for all digital ad inventory outside of the walled gardens (google, et al), which makes it a $10 billion company easily. TTD-like valuations would make it $350/share.

But life is markets now. Check phone in-between gym sets. Check positions so long while I poop that feet go numb every time. Don’t need alarm clock - wake up automatically an hour before markets open. Schedule meetings always after market close. Had to pause my dentist cleaning appt today to “check an important work email”. 

What we think my silly tards? Worth it?
Its ok, look at charts next time. Im on my second account im not rich and on ny first account I lost all of my 2,000 initial investment which may not seem like a lot but to me it is. Took about 2 month break and im back almost break even its ok to make mistakes !
lay off the crack
Of all the stocks to not buy far OTM puts though...good luck.
Don't you think it already jumped the last two times because of beats and probably everyone already figured it'll have a good holiday season?

That takes no foresight. If anything, i feel like this is going to be a run up to earnings day and then a dump on beat. I'm already itching to downvote the waves of idiots posting about "Why's it down 5% after such a good earnings call!?"

Either way, there's a bet to be placed here.

I know 2 business owners that applied for PPP and got an answer from the bank that they don't have money because they prioritized businesses by number of employees. One more business owner requested $10K and received only $3K. All 3 of them are in Brooklyn, specifically, Midwood, Flatbush, and Bay Ridge. One of the banks was Bank of America, not sure about the other two.

A couple of articles for you to understand why money ran out.

 In case you are wondering why this index is not moving. Because it’s a limt down 7%. It immedietly went down 7% when future opens at 6. Thats why it is stuck at .10% down.

I'm aware - you said everyone wore masks even before covid. I showed the video to prove that wasn't the case. Something else is going on in China and it isn't just masks - lots of countries have extremely strict mask mandates and still can't control the virus like China managed (if you believe what they are telling us)

Because my mom would tell me things like "Why aren't you studying for your courses?" and "You've been at your current job for eight months, just because [Super spooky DoD contractor, one you've heard of] wants to recruit you and move you out of Ohio at a 60% raise doesn't mean you should do it, it'll look like you leave jobs too quickly."

But fuck, I hate Ohio so goddamn much. And my current employer, [Only moderately spooky DoD contractor], isn't giving me as much as I would've hoped to reimburse tuition while I finish up my undergrad part time.

This is not the experience of most people just so you know.
Loss was on GME, and SPY puts. Gain is on NIO rolled into tesla and PLTR. Dumb luck really because I bought a Tesla call hours before the announcement of S&P inclusion , then bought more after

What does the size of the bubble represent?
How many of you guys had GME stock two weeks ago?

it was pretty steady at 18,5 + today so that's decent I think
I think you mean $3.00-$4.00
Fuck you

Jesus that’s actually awesome. Why are you here and not just listening to mom
Agreed dude. The guy who made my pizza had no
Mask on. They didn’t seal out a damn thing lol
Normal people AND austistical people would typically concur with your DD.  But what you haven't factored in is the fact that stationary bike companies are trading at 900 PE and PFE is trading less than 5% above pre announcement levels.  You can't use your type of logic for DD.  We are a bubble nation for as long as bubbles last.  The only way your bet works is if everything crashes in which case there exist a boatload of other stocks that will fall harder than a vegas casino.

Either way, best of luck Comrade.  I hope your positions prove me wrong :D

It was never supposed to be gone by the summer. That’s why everyone was spending billions on vaccine... Mask doesn’t make virus disappear, it slows it down. Also, when this was filmed, we didn’t even have COVID-19.
If EVs have a successful market penetration in Europe, these 3 wheels, small car types could be successful. I lived in Spain for a year and mopeds/smart tiny cars were everywhere and allows you to park on popular streets with ease.
don't know why people made fun of Jack Dorsey for looking like a hobo billionaire.  He's at least looks like a regular person.

Almost all the other famous/public facing billionaires look autistic as fuck, like they were born ass first out of their mom's vagina and got strangled by their own umbilical cord.  I mean, just look at Elon musk, Mark Cuckerberg, or fucking Jack Ma.

For the love of god can I get one solid red day to offload these puts I somehow managed my way into
Mnuchin prolly at home playin pogs with his wife's boyfriend.

Under 21 tomorrow and I get 100 used RKT shares.  Probably roll that shit out so no one sees me with em.
Sorry for all these questions but for example how can one know that GME is a squeeze in this case?

Thoughts on Nio tmrw with their release of new car ?
still holding 2 47c 11/27.  Hoping for a two bagger.  Up slightly right now.
The sticker negates this obviously, probably infused with regeneron
Too bad that wasn’t funny.
Who’s the bear that keeps downvoting lol
I HAD stocks of pic related. And I paper-handed them for tiny profit.
Nio sir (idk how true this is tbh) just heard about it from the "earnings call" but idk yet.
Thanks for posting 28 hrs after they broke the news. Will definitely follow up on this hot tip
It’ll prob keep going bc of the s and p inclusion and the free float having to be bought up

Like all good jokes it’s a blend of truth and fiction. The first part is true and sets up the joke. 

Then a blend of truth and fiction to solidify the joke. The number was actually 25% returns and he said he *rarely* gets those. 

Then the punch line. Which in this case is more fiction, because, let’s be honest, I’ll never have my dads approval.
why do ppl keep posting gains/losses in the hundreds?! no one gives a fuck and no one is impressed.

Yeah, I feel like an offering could come sometime in December or in conjunction with the factory news. They actually started running test drives with the media in LA last month and I would assume they would be doing the same at their six retail locations once they've opened.

Isn't BLNK being investigated for grossly overstating how many charging stations they own?
TRUMP PUMP is over, BUYDEN stimulus hopes ON
Do we think Tesla hitting 510? Or down down down?
Is it Nio or Xpeng that will reveal new car tomorrow? If it's Nio then it'll be better for me as my calls outweigh my tiny puts! 😀

They lost money on every bolt they sold, so a more limited marketing budget. I believe they still sold quite a few. They just recalled a bunch for catching fire though.

Usually no, since they are pre-merger SPAC. But there is literally no downside risk (shares can be redeemed for $10 cash if merger fails, this won't fail since Bloomberg confirmed), free 50% gain just from shares.

You are literally investing on an IPO of one of the best EV battery makers.

This post is so irresponsible. I agree that the market is showing weakness and is due for a price correction, but this reeks of scare tactics. How many here have lost money listening to doomsayers. The problem with bearish conditions is that they strike hard and fast. The average WSBer can't recognize the bottom or act upon it quick enough. The smart recommendation would be to start reducing long positions and hedge for a correction. Instead of profiting off down market, they should be focused on surviving it so they have the capital to buy the dip when it's safe.

My first instinct is no: you should not be selling puts on spy.

Hear me out, because obviously in the long run the put seller makes more than the call seller. Both should be done at all times, but directionally speaking there’s much better returns. 

Apple is 6 or 7% of spy. My belief is that apple bricking their old phones, hard, is going to absolutely fuck them up. When you look at an iPhone compared to a google pixel, there’s no clear winner... but ones half the price. It’s going to fuck them up a lot more than a 115 million settlement ordered by the government, good ethics are good business. That’s just my opinion, but if I’m to treat investing/time decay as my income source then I’m going to be pretty suspicious of any company over 1 trillion, but apple just has too much to figure out right now. Rest of spy follows, more or less

As far as raw value I can’t see anything better than weed stocks and particularly aphria as a long term investment... but it helps to keep expectations low because a lot of older, maybe richer people are going to wait a lot longer for that kind of thing before putting their money in even if that’s what they would want to add to their portfolio. And some are more impatient than others, so there should be both short and long term upside.

Since January.  I was able to make quite a few bucks 12k or so.  Took  most of  it out, now getting back into it
So does that mean it will keep going up or stay flat
They're good if you want something to work out in other than compression shorts.
My girlfriend gave it to me for my birthday. Maybe she won't leave me for someone that actually knows what they're doing!
Bought BA weeklies and SPY weeklies. Tomorrow is looking like a bloodbath. I don’t know what to do
If it goes down i'll buy more. You know those SOB Index funds have to buy it next month. You know they are fked.
I have 100% of my portfolio in NIO so there’s no way this goes tits up.
.....3.50
At Tyson Foods meat plants
Thats yuck. I remember talking to a guy who said he had a few thousand way back then but they were basically worthless and he never figured itd go up much. Needless to say hindsight is a bitch. He was down to just a couple. Big ooof
Tomorrow
If he have money tell him to execute the order. But if not yea he totally 100% get fucked
The mooch would like to have words with ya! Edit: wonder how many of his homies bought poots at noon ....
LOL Only if up votes were money. There are plenty of retards getting 25,000 up votes for talking about how small their dick is instead of going to a therapist. You just equated yourself with them.
I turned 10k into 50k big boy
Munchkin still traded silly bandz even after they banned them from schools
Watch ZM moon after I sold my calls for a measly double
Shares are a long term play anyway. I got 100 of em but I'm thinking of snagging a nice leap tomorrow on it. 25c aren't even that pricey for a year out. Maybe this time I won't cover but selling a call like I did NIO and ass blasting all my gains.
I just really am curious as to what made it go up today, other than shorts covering - renaissance buying in? Earnings play maybe.
Ol Carpet Mnuncher cucked me didn't he?
Algo. It probably just took the stopping emergy lending programs at face value and overreacted AH

thanks for that reply, appreciate it. are u particularly knowledgeable in this field and would you care to explain some shit to a retard? i d pm u, thx
If you've seen the big short i think most people here see themselves as Charlie and Jamie
Again as I replied to someone else, if banks cared they’d tighten their margins more on their financing costs comparable to non financials. The banks buy the majority of these mortgages from the non financials to service them anyways. These mortgages rocket and non financials offer are all government backed loans so they’re all sold on the secondary market. Banks still offer a lot of in house/portfolio mortgages that aren’t government backed as well which always pick up a market share that doesn’t qualify for conventional/gov’t mortgages.
Who gives a fck about a lockdown??????

Market is overreacting ugh

I wish I was. I can’t stop thinking about my losses.
anyone got underarmor boxerjocks? shit or nah?
is that when china opens or something?
It’s gone up a lot but looking at the market cap, revenue, and earnings I think no. Compare it to something like Logitech. Definitely some more room to grow. 
FSR seems sketchy, as they don’t have any sales until 2022 but then again EVs have been memed so you never know 
CIIC also seems sketchy/P&D (imo)

Because unga bunga brain literally only has that money because I'm single and literally all I do after work is go home and play games. I don't eat out much, I don't eat expensive foods/live like a struggling college kid, and don't really buy anything. It's just been slowly accumulating in my bank account with 0 investment for the last 10 years. I could've had so much more if I actually tried investing sooner, but covid was the spark I needed to get motivated and try making some profit.

&#x200B;

Also let's be honest probably half my gains were from TSLA
Not a real YOLO unless you’re buying a day before expiry
I think it at some point fundamentals need to matter. Like I said above, I am in complete agreement that the thing is unattractive, but I also look at numbers, and their order numbers and zero debt stand out. There's also a huge usage case here for Europe, where the streets are insanely narrow, and both fleet and delivery services. They've also got a couple much better looking car models on the horizon. With the exception of NIO, I'm actually not one for the EV space at all, but I do like the fundamentals and practicality here.
Papa ma?
I think it would be healthy at this point. If we inflate all these bubbles too much it gets dangerous, I don’t want to see another recession

I don’t get why the munchkin news is a big deal when he’s leaving office in January and new stimulus package coming, so they’re returning unused loan funds that were already set to expire in the original stimmy and then new package will just replenish them? People panic sold after hours and big boys frothing at the mouth to pick up this dip before this inevitable economic recovery sends the markets beyond the Oort Cloud
From when? A week ago?
How long have you been here? Very few bears last. I was a bear from July to October, I turned 7k into $600. I became a bull and turned $600 back into 7k in the past month.
We haven’t seen the worst of corona yet so it’s all just massive speculation.
Dongfeng (DNFGF) - with a name like that it can't go tits up. Downside - it's too cheap for options.

I lost most of my savings this week. Around 80% and I have a little over 5k left. What can I yolo it into? I really need to get that money back by next week cuz I got bills to pay and shit. Plus I’m unemployed so every cent matters. Help me someone!!

Flashbacks to when my puts got destroyed by some random remdesivir news  that drove SPY 3% in 1 day, this market is just built on hopes and dreams
Unless there is concrete evidence, nothing will happen. Luckin coffee only got caught because they investigated themselves. But gsx is still going strong
Has this sub already pumped WTRH? Its like uber eats and grubhub but with a ton of debt. Seems like it should have a retarded spike coming eventually
You overrate the vaccine pump. It briefly brought up lagging sectors but temporarily killed tech, which is the backbone of the current market. NQ would’ve likely made new highs if it wasn’t for that.  

I do expect more volatility and further corrections though, which is why I’m mostly in shares and only day trades calls.
Doubt really. Of anything it will be a national mask mandate and let states decide on lockdown.

Wait on the dip tomorrow for SBE (acquiring charge point in a few weeks). May $35 calls all in if you want a YOLO that could be huge.

The Treasury is effectively ending fed lending facilities for state and muni lending as well as small and mid size corporate lending.
this belongs in r/investing. 


7% on the week only belongs if you were up 60% Monday and down 30% Tuesday, and managed to level it out today. 

Only reason I'm still up 27% is because I guess last Wednesday was real bad. I lost a since yesterday. TGIF's short squeeze cant come sooner.
They threat their customers huh...
No way we go into another national lockdown right?
RemindMe! 24 hours
Because they are industry first. Entrenched...

That means something...

The EVs are already priced as if they are selling millIons of cars. And lets not forget...the car business has razor thin profit margins. Elon has even said they may actually lose money on every car they sell. Cars are a commodity.
EZ fellow tards, he might be on to something all our EV batts need to suck their juice for the tendies from somewhere - I mean there's no like, electricity, in the sun or the moon or the wind

I totally understand up until the repair parts, apple is an absolute cunt when it comes to repairs, infact usually local stores wont repair an iphone past a screen or battery replacement bc of how annoying they do things. Their goal is to get you to go to their stores for repairs so they can overcharge you, which is a pretty good strategy imo

I read this post and was super interested in this company and then someone told me to look up what the cars look like and I almost threw up, fuck this guy and fuck this company, anyone who designs a car like that deserves to go belly up
why? cash per share is just how much cash + easy liquid assets the company has. Book per share includes liabilities and all assets.
I agree with this and wished the young crowd wouldn't read this as trash talk but see that you are actually trying to warn them.  Please study 1988, 2000 and 2007/8.  People remained euphoric and bought the dip way, way too long.  Don't think you will see it coming and adjust.  It will be too late.
I'm going to remember and cherish this comment for the rest of my life.

Mnuchin doesn't just speak on his own. That came from higher up. Probably the President not wanting the market to do well on Biden news. Because the market "needs him".
It’s harder for me to close puts than calls because deep down I just want to watch the world burn
Oh I have spy puts, just thought I’d spice it up
300-400........ not even the volkswagen squeeze did that much % wise relative to GMES price.
Tesla will tank tomorrow. Mark my words.
I genuinely can't believe people are trying to justify these POS EV companies with fundamentals and catalysts. Just take it for what it is, it's hype and smoke & mirrors, these companies are garbage and theres a reason they all traded for $2 a share before they got idiots like us throwing money at the stock.

I don't mean to sound like a bear because frankly I'm not, if theres room to make money by hopping on the bandwagon then by all means make money until you don't know where to put it. Just don't try to justify these gambles with fundamentals and "iNvEsTiNg". 

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.
I understand it's old news to most, but it was new news to me so I wanted to share here to see what the sentiment was like around this company. I understand the profitability piece, but with their cars coming to market in Q1 and zero debt on their books I'd say they're set up for success.

Unlike most new EV dog poop, Microvast already has 100M annual revenue, other competitors are at <4M.

Munchkin took away loans no one wanted. DIX was mega bullish. I think tomorrow is green.
Rocket mortgage/quicken loans has some of the highest margins in the industry. Where do you get that they have low costs?
Maybe up a little here and there but general trend is still down.  I don't think it's time yet for gold calls.  After the stimulus, perhaps, then I'm going heavy on long calls.  I bet GDXJ sees $40 by February.

Yeah it seems like the more worthless the option is the more leverage it has to fuck you with. That's why I aim to enter the short end of the spread after or during a run up, locking in some of the profit from the long end. Should I be trading puts too? I have a bad feeling about this spy quadruple top.

This is sad. You are basically saying, I think some guy with some track record can call a correction within 1-2 months. Just because you took on some serious tone doesn’t mean this should be taken seriously. 

You guys were a dime a dozen in March. Everyone just says what it looks like. If you’re actually smart, you actually won’t change a fucking thing, and keep stuffing it in the market and get paid even more when it dips. If you don’t, you lose. I understand it’s gay retardation central to say that here but it’s literally the only truth.

Cool story, earlier this year i bought a house for 30k. I put 20k into with repairs in 29 days with less than 15 hours of my personal time spent there. Sold it for 80k almost instantly. After fees and taxes, made a quick 14k. It was easy with little to no risk. Yet here i am, blowing thru money in the market like the retard i am. Cheers
dude thx, i've been trying to get this puke green color offa my phone for months. i've been doing it upside down
$520
yep people here have it so easy with 0 comissions just a few years before Robinhood it was from $5 to $20 per trade. 

Now think how many people would buy way out of the money options worth $50 when they gotta pay $20 in commissions and how much it has to grow to break even.
Inverse yourself if you make the wrong trade most times.
GM and Ford are having to replace their ICE vehicles with EVs in terms of production. Explain to me why their value should increase? They'll probably be selling the same number of vehicles once they fully transition over to EVs. Tesla actually has room for growth in its auto business and will grow outside of the auto business with energy and batteries as well as full self driving.

I like how your first lower high is immediately followed by a new all-time high. Meanwhile the lows have been going higher as well. Trade the market in front of you rather then what you think it should be. There’s high volatility because of the Fed, the pandemic, and a divorce from fundamentals, but volatility doesn’t necessarily equal bearish. Tons of experienced traders on fintwit have either blown themselves up or missed the entire rally because they thought a crash was imminent. They splooge themselves with every big 10% correction, and then they immediately lose all their gains when the market rallies hard.
Haha I know right. I will probably try to make one next year when I have more time. I just don't like the feeling of someone potentially losing money because they didn't understand what was I was trying to say about a stock.
ahh ok - don't know what thats like
This is reserved for douchebags. What Mnuchin did today and how he spoke to our beloved Jerome made Trevor Milton look like a saint

I hear you.  

I placed a 100k SPY 260P 1/15/21 bet in June.  You see how that worked out.  This could very easily turn out wrong due to the markets something something irrational something solvent something.
Logic yes - but in this clown market you are better off inverse so calls on Expedia.
Bought BA at the top, and spy at the top. They’re expire tomorrow 😭
What do people realistically think TSLA can hit end of year? 600 is obviously a long shot. Does anyone believe 550 is a realistic scenario?

DIX was up bigly but Mnuchin had to ruin one of the greatest start to a bull run in modern history
As a representative of the 4th reason you listed, I'm going to say 'Jokes on you!' because after losing over $100k on TSLA puts since March, I'm making it back again on NIO because I've learned I need to buy calls on retards.
Did you spam the daily with shitty price predictions? You know you did. The sub has gone soft.

*NIO will be this. PLTR will be that. SPY will go down. SPY will go up.*

"3-Wives Mnuchin". The latest being 20 years his junior. Family man, true-American-values J Pow is probably repulsed.
So, what are we looking at now that it looks like Biden is going to implement student loan forgiveness. So far I've seen numbers between $10,000 to 100% forgiven but, no matter what the amount ends up being it looks like it will happen. Which companies will benefit from this phantom "cash in pocket" that lots of people are suddenly going to find themselves with?

Best decision of your life from what I can tell. 
But seriously take some time to learn what’s going on here. I started on this sub about a year ago and it changed my life. I might be the exception to the rule but I really did buy a big ass boat and a Porsche and a truck off this shit in the Gay bear gang.

As a fellow Canadian the best feeling is profiting off the American economy taking a hit
It's criminal that they got this shit approved but not the Regeneron cocktail.

yeah i hope i'm wrong too, as it would fuck most people here. although I frequent WSB, i'm actually not the YOLO/FD type, so the dilution possibility still makes me uneasy to keep going with TSLA.

Yeah no one went bankrupt taking profit, I already moved on to some other meme stock/SPAC lol.

Clearly you don’t buy much considering how shitty your plays are.
Think of it like poker. Don’t go all in on a high card. Shares are cool, but do you ever plan on holding any share for more than 3 years if you’re a trader?  You’d buy something with the idea that it moves within a year right? Smaller options proportional to your belief that it’ll come true gives you more plays and leverage with less cash
Tesla in 10 years? X10
Tesla in 2 years? Easily over 1000
Tesla in 2 months? Could be 450, could be 1000

For 2 years or 2 months if you believe hard enough why not take a potential x2 to 1000 and turn it into a x2.5

$20K is pennies to large companies like DHL (1:52 in this clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDTfpI8JFLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDTfpI8JFLg)). Also cuts down on space and makes a company look forward-thinking and eco-friendly which is always a wise PR move.

The PT might be wrong, the timing might be wrong, but the direction is completely right. TSLA is a cult stock not worth a quarter of what it trades at. Shady accounting, lying CEO, shoddy quality (see Consumer Reports), weak revenue growth, selling self-driving capabilities that are not as advertised, and on and on. 

Everyone in a cult always believes. Be it MAGA, Scientology, Jonestown, or Christianity. You may be in a cult. Here's some reading if you want out of this cult: https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/tsla.pdf

Bro these are not gonna be itm tomorrow lmfao. I'm bearish as fuck right now and even I can see that a nearly 4% drop is not gonna happen.

Wut? You will be a god if it does but are you counting on hell breaking loose and the 4 horsemen raiding the countryside? Lol.
If you’re breaking even on a -3% day/stretch you are in good shape.

I’m in GLW as well by the way.
If I see a multi percent gain I want to sell. I have no long term conviction.  I may be retarded.

Are you saying overpriced in historical sense or since pre covid? Because unless you jumped in recently, regardless if the down leg I doubt it will be lower than March.


Also, one of your stimulus "trigger" isn't exactly truthful. Schumer announced today his office and Mitch's are talking about that very topic.
It peaked at morning, the way people were talking about it you'd think it was going to at least $20 today. Did not bode well that it had a side ways day after initial open

First time I’ve ever hedged my portfolio of heavy calls with a weekly SPY puts. Got 25 contracts SPY 11/20 360p for $2.10 on Tuesday. Deep red tomorrow would atleast break me even and maybe even slight profit. If we are green then my call profits will outweigh the loss of the puts. Is this the way?

Positions: 
WMT $150c 1/21 for $4
COTY $3c ‘22 for $1.1
PFE $40c March 21 for $1.15
GLW $40c March 21 for $.95
DKNG shares at $40 (1000)
PYPL $200c for $13
RKT $27c Jan 2022 for $5 🤢
OXY $15c Jan 2022 for $2.6

So what are you looking for? 10x in 1 year? More % in less time moves risk up immensely and you’d have to be moving the money around a lot more. Which means you’ll be paying taxes too.

NIO has support of Chinese government. They can literally only make people buy their EV's if they want.
I honestly was really thinking this guy had a great piece until he stated his positions that expire in 2020 LMAO. Seriously, not even a month out? Macro corrections from euphoria take time to develop and can go on much longer than you would ever expect.
That’s because the euphoria peak of 54 actually was retarded prior to earnings and price target upgrades. Ignore that shit. It’s erroneous data caused by all of retail fomoing into one stock. 

NIOs high for the day broke past the previous high since the Citron report (after the crash from 54). We’ve also had higher lows each day since the drop. 

This is the cup and handle.

It’s purely a revenge move from trump to make Biden’s life more difficult
Futures are where it's at.  SPY is child's play.
Futes go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Because dey frozen
Anyone else out tn Shilling TSLA? No? Just me?
I see it as niche. Too expensive for mass market.
Your mom was just absent when you was needing milk because she was trading stocks. Nothing to be ashamed over. You can’t cry autism in here when your moms a professional all you have to do when in doubt is just ask mom.

Mom? I’ve got 50 calls on tsla right now expiring next week for 600 strike price. If you ask her right before it falls she will save you from a terrible mistake while the rest of us dumbass will end up taking losses. Lol

I learned the autism comes from declaring your self a retard after you realize how dumb your last 50 trades were and the final one that rips your account and savings. 

Mom let’s you do that?
Pfizer is expected to apply for EUA tomorrow morning.  Would bet on approval by the first of the December.
Nice bro
it ain't updated
Vaccine overload: PFE, MRNA, KDK.

In a generation, all the world's population will become autistic.
It’s frozen retard. It’s currently -.85% hahah
I grabbed $1k of this today. I think it has room to run. Pet ownership in China is still way below western countries, which comes on top of massive premiumization trends in pet food and products. This is also a market where the retailer has tremendous power.

[https://imgur.com/a/hfOyNg4](https://imgur.com/a/hfOyNg4)
Where did you go??
Up to 150 shares now. Nothing crazy, but enough where I make a few bucks off significant movement. Strikes me as a potential momentum AND value play.
i mean they did buy some shopify and a very tiny amount of nintendo, but they sold a lot more.
Did stumble in to the dark side of the internet again?

This is what Ark does. Tsla is still far and away their largest holding across most of their portfolios. It’s just good management practices and balancing
I’m sure, I wasn’t saying anything about losses. All I was saying was you have to have a much larger chunk of money because of the cost of owning shares at large quantity.
Anybody buy GME puts today?

Enlgish!
Have you considered eating my ass? I wiped like 5 times and even did a couple of "run the TP bundle under the sink water" a few times to make sure it's like 98.5% clean down there.

Just a thought.
Why tf futes recovering?
Beginning balance: $711,424.99
Total gain of day: $10,354.01
Ending balance: $721,424.99

% of Total day gain = total gain of day/beginning balance 

$10,354.01/$711,424.99 = 0.01455

0.01455 = 1.455% ~ 1.46%

I asked my wife’s boyfriend to help me out. :)
Yah... I know haha.  
There's no way I could've even imagined it would go up like this after an indefinite delay.

Oh well, not the first time I've lost out on killer gains; certainly won't be the last.

If I can do it, you can too! Here's some advice from a fellow autist who came out of the hole.  
Don't go too hard on weeklies, give your options some time.   
Don't fight the momentum.  
Don't double down on loosing positions!
Yeah I don’t understand why this company would take off other than it is an electric vehicle

Huh why
Are you out of your mind? The only way you can trade for 20 years profitably is with discipline. Never risking more than 5-10% of account value, taking profits soon and losses sooner. You think those people who drop 500k on low-odds options last very long? There’s more than enough evidence in this sub of people blowing up their life savings and then some on FDs. Longevity in the market means being smart and being right more than you’re wrong. If you’re trading for lambos I give you a year max before you bust out.

First, just be sure you're considering the fact that even gold and silver were crashing to the floor back in March.  Including it in your TA isn't exactly perfectly logical since everyone was selling everything, every single asset class became correlated at an unprecedented level.

&#x200B;

Also, for those who don't know what MTN is: " **Vail Resorts, Inc.** (MTN) is an American mountain resort company. The company is divided into three divisions. The mountain segment owns and operates 37 mountain resorts in three countries, Vail Resorts Hospitality owns or manages hotels, lodging, condominiums and golf courses, and the Vail Resorts Development Company oversees property development and real estate holdings. The company trades on the New York Stock Exchange, symbol MTN. The company is headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado."

I had no idea what it was until seeing this post and I'm assuming the same for others.

&#x200B;

One last thing, his theory is pretty good IMO, but his execution on the play is seemingly terrible.  The markets are very forward looking, one missed season isn't going to kill 40% of the company's value, and even if it might, why would you want your breakeven scenario to be -45% returns?  Just buy a 260p or 250p and if it hits big, you'll still make a ton of money.  MTN is currently at 276, rebalance to a higher strike OP.

Why are we down HUGE AH?
I'm mostly bearish the past month and agree with you.  Especially any future that is +/- 1 % doesn't seem that significant to me.  QQQ isn't dropping much in AH, SPY is down a bit more, but I find the AH market is the best time to buy shares due to overreactions.
I think about this a lot. As soon as I can make the 20% cash down payment from 50% of my portfolio then its crib time.
Hey everyone, don't listen to this guy. The fed can and does "print money", there is TRILLIONS in liquidity that has no where else to go, it was why the market "recovered".  It's all fake, reasons don't matter, the FED WINS ALWAYS!

Agreed. And the election’s over. Wish people would move on. 

My point though, is that very few people, whatever they say on camera, whatever their politics, are actually being all that conservative. Most people are eating restaurant food again, going out for non emergencies, having a few friends over, etc. They were either willing to go to Trump rallies, or willing to go to protests and then street parties when Biden was declared the winner. Heck, I doubt most people even wash their hands and sterilize their Amazon packages and groceries like they did back in April. 

And when most people, deep down, aren’t willing to suffer minor inconveniences for the virus, we’re not going to have the will to take the damage of another shutdown. Which quite possibly will have tragic consequences, but until it does, the market probably goes up.
I too follow the Cathy. They barely bought shit. Cash gang is the way.

Not gonna lie. Likely the most insightful post in the history of this sub.

While I do think we’re at or near the top, I don’t believe the market will crater or a collapse in bullion in the next 3-6 months. I think we’re going to see a pronounced dip next year, perhaps long lasting too, but there’s so much appetite for alpha out there that will take a March-like event to sell off in any dramatic way.

What it does. Give it time.
It’s generally a horrible use of capital and the market is all about opportunity cost. For the pittance that you are getting, you’re having to take on a lot of risk. Plus the farther out you go the more external risks you expose yourself to (Wirecard, Enron, Lehman Brothers). 

If you’re a giant investing house and can move in and out and scrape millions of pennies daily, then it’s worth it, otherwise not much in it for a retail investor

How does call a vote and trigger a squeeze work?
After reading through that the market is obviously going up🚀🚀🚀🚀
🖕🌈🐻
Wow I’m so retarded I don’t even know how to check futures on Bloomberg or MW now that Investing.com is down.
I’ve timed every SPY call and put wrong this week after two weeks of perfection. Finally just broke down and bought a 4/16/21 $357 call with half of my little account at about 2:45. I think SPY has dropped $3 after hours since. I feel like there’s gonna be a big correction at some point before the vaccine is widespread but hopefully at some point before like January while my call still has some theta value SPY will get back up over $360 so I can make a little cash. Those short term calls were gonna give me an untimely stroke if I kept goin with those
There’s going to be a big bump when a vaccine gets emergency fda approval next month
The stock will get destroyed if enough people see this video and sell the shit out of it. Or it could get investigated.
Everyone wears masks there - since you are like 2 years old - even before the pandemic. It’s part of their social norm - like wearing a scarf.

That Robinhood  traders are smarter than boomers
The main problem is that these resorts make their money from upper class global travelers. Less people flying in and staying at hotels means less revenue for the company. 

The high end ski resorts in Colorado make tons of revenue from 1) people from the northeast who don’t like to ski on ice 2) Midwesterners (still good during COVID), and 3) Mexico City tourists (none this year).  1 and 2 will be reduced, and 3 will be non-existent. That said, I wouldn’t short them. But I also wouldn’t try to go long either. Better plays out there.

In her mid twenties, my mom wore black leather jackets, smoked, and had a bleached-blonde buzzcut. So yes, my mom was cooler than I will ever be in my entire life.

Now she's just a suburbanite retiree with a handful of minor hobbies and some gal pals to gab with. But, she's still brilliant, and she's got a lot of strong opinions.

Yeah, Nancy was adamant about a 2.2 trillion stimulus and refused to compromise at 1.88 trillion. Even her fellow advisors thought she should have accepted the 1.88 trillion and see if it will pass through the Senate.

Now whether or not it would have passed, especially through McConnel is uncertain. 

The fact of the matter is Nancy cucked a 1.88 trillion dollar stimulus package from going to the Senate. Do you get this or are my facts wrong?

Because they have a moral duty to protect their subordinates. If a parent bet on how many times their child would be raped, and then personally did so to hit their number, no morally or mentally normal person would be high fiving them for their 200 IQ strategy.

&#x200B;

There's a huge difference between fighting over "tendies" with fellow degenerates and some single mom suffocating to death because she wanted to make rent and her employer is indifferent to employee deaths.

&#x200B;

There's also a self-interest aspect to this. Anyone willing to plow dead employees into the dirt is willing to do the same to customers. If you're a vegan or only eat locally farmed elite chicken, that's one thing, but I eat chicken products, so I'd prefer a "zero body count" philosophy to rule decision making.

So 12/18 SPY $400 calls is it. Got it.
Unemployment, QE deflationary, markets overvalued, ppl have been saying this for years even before the covid crash, then ppl doubled down during the crash and after the crash despite NASDAQ blowing through ATHs. A lot of stocks are still very cheap, most of the rally was/is fueled by tech, who are making record gains, have zero cash flow problems, in fact they have even more cash now because they cut a lot of cost... market pricing in a world where tech has completely taken over, which it kind of has. Are there overvalued companies? For sure, but that’s always been true. Interest rate at zero means these big tech companies can take out cheap loans to invest in even more growth, wallstreet has been sleeping on tech for years now, most of them only look at balance sheets, which doesn’t mean much for companies that are literally taking over/disrupting entire industries. Do you know anyone working in tech? You should talk to them instead of listening to a bunch of suits with useless MBAs

More oil and gas calls.  They are all still really cheap and that oil price staying stable over 40.  The rest of the market is super expensive, but oil and gas is cheap.  All those boomers that went from 50 to 10 this year.  Buy at 10 and pick up the recovery.
You should sell it and invest in an etf, so to recover the Money in few years. Don't be retarded

Logitech is very fairly priced right now. It declined with stay at home stock with vaccine announcement last Monday which wasn't warranted, has been recovering ever since. I think it goes up another 10% in the next 2 weeks.

I dunno man. Are you considering MGM's ownership abroad, like in China where Covid19 is so 2019?  It's basically business as usual over there.  Also, MGM is into online sports betting a al Draftkings with BetMGM.  Online betting is expanding and legalized in additional states as of a few weeks ago.  That will lead to additional revenues beyond their B&M casinos.

Mortgages are loans secured by the house/land. 


The closest/shadiest thing you can do now is to take out a personal/student loan and deposit it in  a brokerage account. Then, you would apply for a margin account, which essentially uses the personal/student loan as collateral. 

This is probably fraud, but brokerages most likely aren’t very stringent in fighting this kind of thing since if it goes belly-up, it’s the original lender getting screwed and not Robinhood/TD ect. . 

To anyone reading,do not do this kind of thing unless you’ve consulted with an attorney to make sure it isn’t considered fraud. It’s also just a generally bad idea overall.
TSLA down 1% ah
Theta about to skull fuck you brother
Keep in mind post covid cut back in business travel and Airbnb imo will squeeze a lot of hotels only ones that will survive will be the ones tied to water parks and theme parks.
Good luck fellow retard. I’m glad this motivated you.
SPM puts seem like the better dagger out of all of them. Record lows for Black Friday will be sure to bring it down, plus the lottery pick of a state lockdown.

They red states, they don't believe in masks and science, so therefore they can't believe in something they can't see and will only do what's beneficial for their short term monetary situations aka carry on as normal and hope the coastal states will bail them out before they all die.

I don't see an easy way to find the exact leaders, although at least one source I looked at said Texas, California, and Florida were in the top 5 with Illinois close behind. 

I think your comment about being locked down when it wasn't bad in the Midwest has a lot of validity. My wife's business was closed for two months before we had almost any spread in Ohio. At the time, it was sold as a brief lockdown to give government time to prepare. While things aren't locked down anymore, I don't think people were given the impression their kids' educations would still be largely on hold eight months later.

Even the non serious "simply retirement" investors I know have shifted to bonds with just a small amount in the rest of the market to play the run-up to the crash
You’re averaging down on puts as the stock runs up? You’re fucking dumb. Don’t say rape unless you’re talking about something serious, you turd.
Actual quotes from Cramer's interview with the Robinhood co-CEO:

RH CEO:  "Robinhood investors acted as a stabilizing force during the volatility and the crash."

RH CEO:  "I think a large part of it is the time horizon.  People who are investing for the first time in their 20s or 30s have a very different outlook than people who are maybe a handful of years from retirement.  When you're younger you know there's decades of compound returns and decades of riding out the ups and downs of the market."

CRAMER:  "These people are smarter than we were and are.  Vlad, I'm not kidding, your people are incredibly well-versed in the companies they buy."

Not enough emojis. It's not your gf texting you back.
Real talk, covid hospitalization/deaths spiking and treasury ending emergency fed programs *might* just be enough to spark a correction.

Odds are still low though. I give it a 20% chance.
Saying “green by open” must be some sort of coping mechanism I guess.
Nice
My guess is MRO or APA
I am good with a spy dump as long as EVs dump right along. I have a small SPY call position I bought today I will gladly sacrifice to the Meme gods to see NIO and Nkla go to Satans B&B.
Watcha mean?
Not great
Black Friday came a week earlier this year. Loading up cheap calls tomorrow 😋


sometimes i feel like i should quit working and just trade all day, but i would probably tinker more and make less.

i know how to read and how to right now. here on to be on reddit is not common for my background. i am the first man in my family.

After corona start, I promise myself and all my family that I will be first boy done with hs and in 4 years, and for boys that is very important. spelling is hard and now when I see other spelling like you right "incoherent" we say it like " i can here (or hear  it" it sounds like apart and more right here bc i know on reddit its only for genius  on this sub very special genius. i hope to make more friends on zoom calls to trade information and inside information even. everyone on reddit knows outsid einformation with % bc they talk about it outside. in library (hard word to spell and to say to. i have to practice there because it is more easy to read, write and think. i love thinking and reddit name still make me think after 6 years on here.

i was scared to be right with this inside information on here bc i know you all are the very smartest from the us and world but mostly us bc they dont have wall street in other countries and lands.

and now with liberal/leftist after russia bats were starting to be everywhere and you can not tell bc they talk with outside voice and use outside informarion, then they change to inside voice and information. and when you read it (right and read like last time were problem to right on here. even tho, i know how to read but was not 100% to do it here and bc they invited here and then i was confirmed (after i took the classes on the interwebz b4 Corona, 2020 crazy times) and ready to right on reddit,a nd all because i read it. you guys are weird on wall street bets. or is it bats :) good night biys and girls and parents very lucky to make money with important genius. i will be learning for long time but it will be good for my kids who are 5 and 7.

I unloaded my airlines positions as soon as the Pfizer vaccine news dropped. I knew people would overreact. Now I invested that money on palantir.
IWM has to be fucked right
Bearish factors:

-tendie printer gone 

-market is artificially held up right now 

-Cramer called us intelligent 

Bullish factors:

-Stocks go up 

-record active covid cases 

-talks of possible stimulus talks in 2 months 

-bears think they’re right this time



Overall: Bullish
Yes. Bought before the March dip, got fucked by listening to boomer then adjusted my strategy. Currently 20%+.

Moral of the story: DO NOT listen to boomers! They age differently.
I regret every move I make

Same. It’s been my biggest gainer. Like 10%+ on m/w/f days. Usually in and out in the am on the swings and maybe some eod but most profit from the first half hour/hour. May the tendies print in our favor.

How can those print when my spy 355p are printing?

Satellites normally have to pay more to add propulsion systems of their own which cost, money, time, and take up space. SpaceX rideshare program will have drop off locations in orbit for small satellites but those usually are not the final position some satellites want to be in. That is a reason why Momentus is valuable since the have a space tug named Vigoride to do the final delivery. There is only 1 or 2 other companies that could be real competition. I go into more detail in the video.

But I’ve been putting money in SRAC, I think it’s got a pretty good chance.

I held on and I'm going to keep holding on. I made back some of that money so let's just hope for either a rally, even a gradual one, or a crash. If it either goes consistently up or crashes hard, then I'll make back more of the money I would have lost by pulling out on open.

I understand that the stimulus isnt entirely tied to the market but the size of the package will definitely be influenced by where the stock market stands.

Held these losing SPY puts so long that they've become a part of me.  They've become my only friends. Everyday we joke about how MM hates us and how chad bulls could never treat calls like we would treat them. But sadly, I might have to let these puts go into another retards hands tomorrow but i'll never forget how you made me feel. All the times we've cried together, been margin called together, asked friends to gofundme for my sick dogs vet bills (more SPY puts) good times.. good times.

Same. Hope I won’t regret
dunno how long u have been at this shit, or how much time u invest.

, def gonna need some experience, a lot of these dudes here got beginners luck.

i had a straight year of losses until i actually found a strategy(s) that worked for me. given that all of retail is basically retarded now, and this volatile market, i’ve been getting very lucky. 

none of us know shit, but if u see MCD fall after earnings, yet analysts give $220 price target upgrades, its probably wise to buy that dip. and look it worked

figure out what works for ya. gl. it helps if ur poor so $100 is a lot to u, then when lose u learn more
good work

Afterhours is the worst,, why couldnt we have just dumped during the day huh??
I have bought strikes from $150 up to $190. My thought is that Vail is in a much worst position this year compared to last year. They had to raise debt after the March lockdown so their balance sheet isn’t as healthy. If their stock dropped to $135 after only missing the tail end of their most profitable quarter last year. I wouldn’t be surprised if it went lower with a shutdown at the beginning of their most profitable quarter
That makes this so much better. Can you imagine all the LinkedIn messages the real SVM is getting from idiots in this sub? Lol.

Which news are you referring to?
Here's the dirty secret about TA:    
      
Everyone adjusts their charts to be right.      
   
Besides psychological supports and resistances, stocks mostly move based on speculation, events and breaking news. When you try to back test a function or analysis based on the numbers, you have to start making so many adjustments or exclude data to make it make sense.
Who's doing this service currently, that Momentus would be replacing?  For example, if I pay SpaceX to take my satellite up, does my satellite have to position itself?  Or does SpaceX do that? Or does it just stay wherever SpaceX dumped it in space?  


I know satellites control their orientation, but never thought about them having to get moved around the earth.

*He accused Mnuchin of keeping facilities more important to wall street open, while shuttering those oriented at municipalities.*

You may be wrong about the dilution, as other said : it has already been diluted. This is not like other inclusions however as for the market cap of this company. Will it ever be as big as google or amazon? Probably not. They may keep an advantage but being one of the first in a market doesn't necessarily mean staying the best. That's competition, and that's okay, they won't disappear any time soon.  

You are fucking right however about cashing in though. Isn't it the goal, to make money? Fuck the retards who'll call you paper hands, you made a profit, congrats.

And fuck off to /r/investing for not yoloing on calls, I should know, I'm a retard /s

Thats exactly what im saying. There needs to be more pain in order for a large stimulus to pass. 

But I disagree with your comment that the Republicans messed up the stimulus. If you will recall that towards the end of October Mnuchin offered a 1.88 trillion dollar package which Nancy declined! Had she agreed, it would have gone through the Senate and had a shot at passing.

While I somewhat agree with what you’re saying, the covid stimulus package is not only focused on the stockmarket , it also has the paychecks to households etc. So I don’t think it would need to get so bad for them to sign and agree on a deal. Further, America wants to stay on top and China’s massive economical bounceback makes US more likely to pass a bill sooner rather than later. Only limiting factor is who gets the credit (and Biden said he no longer cares about that). It might be sooner than you think

I’m not rich or anything like some of these other guys but honestly the best thing that I did to start making money was taking it slow. I’ve had so many times when I wanted to go all in something because I felt like I had to make a play and I ended up burning myself  but at the end of the day it’s better to wait a week or two and make a really good play than force a play when it’s not there. I’m a big time noob but I’ve been burned enough to not make the same mistake twice.

Imagine thinking we will actually go down tomorrow lmao
This is the way.
Booze is a good way to pass the time. We are all friends here.
Oh yeah, what do I expect it's WSB
We’re going to melt up before we crash. It’s kind of essential. The market has to be extra bullish for things to collapse. Right now people are too bearish because we’re dancing around ATH, so any dip people sell and buy puts. Only an over-leveraged market will allow the crash that is desperately needed
Fruit roll ups in my ass

Not a 🐻. But you know something is wrong with the market rallying with COVID hospitalizations going up, no stimulus in sight, and half the states ordering stay-at-home orders

I'm already positioned for long term Covid recovery and a short term rebound on SAH stocks.
I guess I'm bicurious?

donny already called the top, you can't just say "market go down" after he tweets, that's cheating my boy.
Surely it can't keep going. But I said that at 7 when I was looking at it....

Heres my theory:

In order for a 2- 3 trillion stimulus package to pass the senate, there needs to be some major volatility in the stock markets. How can you say with a straight face that a stimulus package of that size is needed right now with stock markets at ATH.

Back in March a 2.2 Trillion stimulus package was passed within weeks only because the stock market was limiting down like every day.

My take is they tank the SPY below 300, start turning up the covid-19 news coverage and states start issuing stay at home orders. Only then will there "motivation" for another large package to pass.
What is this in response to?
As long as CRSR and PLTR don’t dump, I’ll probably be fine

I do so with both my mom and dad who are mostly supportive. though my father at one point called it "gambling" and my mother did get a bit concerned at another point though I have returns to speak for (up 45% last 6m). I only have about $12k currently however so maybe that will change.

Get rid of it man. Looked at RKT when trying to refi my mortgage and they were WAY above anyone else in terms of cost. People are willing to spend a little more time getting different estimates on something like that and aren’t gonna just go with whoever is easy online. Wouldn’t touch RKT with a 10’ pole.
If it’s purely virus fear, money in stocks will move from value plays to stay at home plays. If it’s recession fears money will move from stocks to something more stable. So the question is why are we selling off?
I'm only joking. Feel like we can be called something more sinister as we're holding PLTR...PLTRS the sith

Maybe y’all can afford some iPhones now
FED can basically no longer guarantee loans.  Banks won't eat those losses now, so what are they gonna do?  Not lend.  Ever see what happens to a country when there is a credit liquidity freeze? Economic collapse. Trump admin is basically neutering the FED who kept the Great Depression 2 from happening.

Welcome home retard
All are logical explanations. People have been working on mRNA for decades. This is not new. Yes, the storage reqs. are an issue, but imagine if you could create a viable vaccine with mRNA? The possibilities are endless. 

Somehow this still smells like market manipulation. I have no doubt that the scientists behind are doing their best and that we will get the vaccine one way or another, but I would be really cautious betting for or against these stocks.

If you really want the thrill of options trading, then the closest thing to that would be trading CFDs. However the spreads can fuck you over since you are essentially taking the opposite position of your CFD broker.

15k -> 18k 

I wonder tomorrow
This is neither bullish or bearish for any stock. It is simply planning on ending programs that were barely used.
But like when’s the breakthrough, when does the tech become actually used
Immediately what I thought as well
My father taught me that a trader does not even need to know what the company does, in order to trade it. You trade in and out on technicals. This is true here because many WSB members have been making a killing on these EV trades, yet they don’t even know what the vehicles look like, or even how many are sold.

Now an investor should know the fundamentals. Although he calls investments “trades that went wrong.”

Yeah, I love that game. If you're not playing ranked, switch over. Casual play is so terrible, ranked people actually play as a team.

$BABA not doing this cuz shoppers can’t shop in outer space?
$208 is what i’ve been getting in on my short dated weekly scalps.

$212.5-$215 definitely means it’s breaking out, but as u can see if u bought there in this past week (with options especially) u wud be down right now.

to answer ur question, id say $210-212.5. 

The earnings is still a wee bit away, and considering how CVS, a stock with a huge catalyst, was at a 52 week low before earnings, wouldn’t surprised me if this stock gets beat up until earnings. Dunno bro.

Think about it. Mnuchin taking money from the Fed. This is ALL Trump's hand. He's saying "fuck you if I'm going to lose then you guys can't play anymore"
Damn who said?
if you're asking about NNDM in a roundabout way it's a good long term play. Short term it's been great but off of no news or catalysts. Buy leaps or boomer shares.

Oh you know this place is desperate when it starts spamming about DIX and GEX. That shit embarrasses the other indicators on the playground. It’s like a crayon drawn TA got pregnant, and the baby daddy—a  National Enquirer horoscope—refuses to support the child, so the crayon drawing gets a back alley abortion, but the fetus somehow lives to be stared at by autists visiting a carnival freak show.
So like 95% of this sub

Goddamnit , Gump. This is the smartest shit I’ve read all week. 

Why such a weak position though? I hardly consider a 1.5% movement “tanking”. Donny pumps get us that without even trying.

Okay, so MMs don’t have any positions in the market, but they are essentially who you are buying/selling from every time you trade. When you buy some stock, they sell it to you. But since they don’t own stock, they’re technically ‘short selling’ those stocks. That’s why short volume in the market is typically 50% of market volume. This also applies to Dark pools. Dark pools are where big league traders exchange millions and billions of dollars of stock without affecting market price, because they aren’t done through public exchanges. But Dark pools still have MMs, and so whenever stocks are bought in a dark pool, some MM is short selling them. You can track these short sales and use it to determine trading preference in the dark pools. Anything above 45% is bullish, anything below is bearish.
I gotchu but if you put in 30k with a 50/50 to make 200% gains. That’s just retarded. And way too safe. I put in 600 with 1% chance of making profit and .00001% chance of making a 100 bagger.
It's the dad's account dumb dumb

Do you know how to do calls on Robinhood? I can’t figure it out... but will do
ay mang, i won’t argue with that. But cmon, WMT, MCD a lot of other consumer discretionary are moving up with DG is down from ATH.

Regardless of what WMT MCD do, DG, I think, is not worth $208. don’t be surprised if it moves to $220 before earnings and u got on a nice scalp.

i posted this DD cuz i felt there were several ways to play this, the most probably and best might just be $210 12/18 calls lol

Things really do feel disconnected from reality here. Every baboon with access to internet can make profit just as easily as yoloing all in NIO.

No idea if or how hard is gonna be the dip/crash but I’m sitting at 45% cash. Wondering where to put it but all this things just make me wait more and more.

Still sucks to miss gains tho

I think my retarded ass found the perfect hedging strategy. Put credit spreads on VXX. Stonks go down and I’ll make my max profit with VXX rising. Stonks go up and my stonks make a lot of money, and with a 10-15% OTM spread I can still hit max profit on VXX if stonks don’t go up an insane amount. And if they do, that’s fine, I’ll eat a small loss on the spread or roll out

What are the top states for covid deaths in the last month? All those states you mentioned got hit pretty hard early. Midwest states didn't get hit but were told to lockdown, which is probably why more of them thought it was a hoax. Now they're getting fucked. Not arguing just my 2 cents
Am I retarded or are these premiums retarded?

Annnnnnnd Treasury takes the punch bowl away from the Fed and like clockwork the market throws a tantrum. Now watch what happens if Congress continues to drag their feet on stimulus. 1987 crash type scenario which will immediately provide stimulus and more money printing. Wall Steet wins.
I bought on Tuesday right before the final dip, which kinda pissed me off.  Lost some value on day zero so even with a +72% day on the 11/27's today, I'm only up 10% from where I bought.  I expect more green days than red over the next week tho.  I wouldn't be surprised if it hits $220 again next week while it starts running up to earnings.
This shit looks retarded... i’m in!
At some point they have to start raising it by .25%. When that happens load up on as many puts as you can easy 10 baggers
I’m just pissed. I had 40, 11/20 352p that I sold for a 60% loss. Probably would’ve been better off holding but it was better than losing 100% in my opinion. I just shouldn’t have bought calls..

Fairly certain that news broke before the bell. Price in. You're probably fine.

You want to buy otm and itm options that are cheap.  How do you know of they are cheap?? Well you need to watch options prices and when they drop.

The next step is Tesla and Apple will be up.

So I'd go with Tesla calls. Expensive, but it will touch 540 soon.
SOY? 

SOIL? 

SOLD?

SELL!! 

SELL!!!
Careful with spacs, they can go down faster then they came up. Also you need to read the rules carefully, % of ownership. I dont really like the ideas guys that have no product, no revenue maybe something in 2025. These guys have to go the Spac route because they wouldnt be able to IPO otherwise.

Havent looked at CIIC that much yet, 7% ownership of the merger company is on the thin side. If you wanna buy it you will probably get a better price soon when the FOMO crowd loses patience.

Out of the EV spacs I like SBE, but it already had a large run and recently the warrants I have went up quite a bit. Should have bought more.

TSLA is a lotto because of a potential gamma squeeze. r/options had an intersting call fly (butterfly spread) trade idea to catch the momentum: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jx16id/tsla_momentum_tradebought_1000_nov_call_flys_that/

Then out of chinese ones XPEV and LI are less overvalued than NIO, if you can stomach the "luckin coffee" risk you can sell puts to the WSB crowd. WSB is trying to time the top driving put premiums up. Alternatively buy long dated ITM calls.

Oh okay, investing.com just hasn’t updated yet. No worries though.

not sure if u've noticed but retail stores "beating" earnings is no longer a surprise these days. In fact, retail is beating earnings by less than their previous quarters. Even with IV out of the equation, I don't believe there is an earnings play

This market is straight up retarded and I love it. I've made so much money just inversing myself.
Things not looking good right now.
Was just at best buy last night and their PC aisle was STOCKED with all kinds of corsair stuff: keyboards, mouses, mouse pads, gaming pads, memory, cpu AIO coolers, power supplies, etc. They are the real deal should honestly be THE name in PC components. 

On a side note I fucking love that Best Buy is starting to carry more PC components. I honestly think if Gamestop would go all out on stocking tons of PC components specifically for PC gamers, they could get a lot of business from that. I'd much rather go buy a delicate high end PC component from a local store than buy it offline if I had the option.
No SPY on RH is -.7 now AH
This can be true my puts saved ?!

When is its IPO? This week? It sounds like money and I'm in.

Nope. Still retarded. You're hoping for a substantial drop. It doesn't seem likely.

But Biden said no lockdown.
TA does not apply in this market. I don't know why people still state various patterns. Yes. We are either going up or down. I agree.
If markets are selling off because of lockdown, it usually moves like vix, but if it’s just risk off because of recession, it’ll move down

As the price of PMs possibly rise like you predict, the supply will flood in. I don't think there will be an explosion of prices, but a gradual increase over a period of many years until supply can catch up. Mines will also be nationalized if the price goes high enough. Mining is still a tough business in which to be profitable.

FED is kneecapped from backstopping the economy because the UST is demanding their money back (for all of the programs that kept the economy working).  We fooked.
 Cramer calling out "up" stocks: SQ, PYPL, TSLA, ROKU, AMZN, NOW, OKTA, RING, TWLO and TGT. Good picks but what about ZM?

Even is this stock would be a 100-bagger, I would't touch it, lmao. Just look at it.
Saw on [investing.com](https://investing.com)'s chatCouple of reasons to be bearish

1) California curfew   
2) Fed programs ending   
3) Biden saying vaccine logistics will be slow and difficult  
4) Biden announcing Treasury pick will be welcomed by progressives   
5) More Corona measures expected   
6) Trump ramping up his election stuff

Any link? I checked his twitter and looked around is moochie involved in this?
Investing.com forgot to pay their bills
Futures r down like  0.10 and u retarded ass bears r celebrating lmfao this is what yall live for? 🤔
First check to make sure 1 isn't delayed. Second, if they are in sync, you have to match it up to the close times. SPY AH is always matched to the 4 PM close. Futures might be marked to 415 or 430. Technically you as a trader should only care about it vs 4 since that's your last pnl update.
This simple question is a 5sec Google. If you really wanna learn about options use OIC. The option industry council. They have a YouTube channel and educational video starting for people with 0 knowledge. Just take your time and watch it
these programs + QE are why SPY is above 200 right now

the fed is the market, remove them from the market and investors are gonna peace out
I mean it doesn't have a bottom til merger....so there's that.

4) put in cinnamon

5) wait til tender, pour milk in bowl and eat the candies cinnamon pumpkin while dipping in bowl.

We need the GOP to win the Georgia senate races so that Biden doesn’t fuck up the economy by raising capital gains taxes and repealing the Trump tax cuts. 

Biden is cool for EVs and renewables but he’s a total cuck when it comes to the stock market. 

Tom Nash on YouTube has a good video on this topic.
Highly likely over the next 3 weeks. 3 month chart is a perfect head/shoulders formation.

If it’s not going to go down, it’s going to breakout and we are prolly gonna hit 370+

Are you planning to hold calls through earnings?  And if so which ones are you thinking? With the IV so low now this could be a winner I think.  Especially if there's a market sell off tomorrow which brings DG lower.  Thanks for the DD.

Like some have already said, consider the cost/benefit of getting a mortgage instead of buying a house outright. Even at a high interest rate you can easily beat it in returns on a simple SP500 investment.
I think tomorrow is a good day to just look around the office very bewildered, wondering how we got this point. Then sweat for like 10 minutes, then just  buy the dip...sigh.
Position?
WTf now Roblox is filing to go public!?
What he do?
Eh, I like to be deep ITM in the account I bought this on. My RH I’ll make plays like that.
Not necessarily, the S&P 500 will have to buy shares of Tesla, last I saw about 50 billion dollars worth, and it will drive Tesla's price up for people who are invested in Tesla. After they get their position, they rebalance every so often, and they will either sell or buy based on the market cap of S&P 500 companies.

Basically, they only get gains after they buy, like we do, so if it continues to go up after they buy, yes. If it corrects after the large demand from the index subsides, then no.
Cool thanks

How is futures opening 10 points in the red getting you bears so hard. Us March bears had standards at least
Wow! Glorious! 😭of joy.
So buy ZM fds, got it!
Damn sold my puts too early again dad
PULL! PULL! PULL! PULL!
Hahahahaha. Hahhha
Still turned 10 into 600....Not a bad day in my book.
Why is futures so flat?
Lol held 354s till 2 min before the bell
Well Mnuchin just turned this into a bear market.
SE gang, rise up!
Yeah here's the problem: this sub was bullish until close. It went bearish after everyone was locked into their positions.

Holding puts is the profitable inverse in action.
Hey retards buy FCEL I’m not trying to manipulate the market in favor of my $6 calls at all
hmm you may be right, and if it thought this way years ago, I'd be up on AMZN. But I doubt that price entry point is a rounding error...I think it influences volume of buy and sells per day likely. Not that it really matters long term.
DAILY REMINDER THE RUG PULL IS TOMORROW
I heard Biden is going to spread it or something.
Nice !!! I had two weeklies not big gains  and one  more l left to ride that expires on the 4 th
Stop buying that shit and buy spy puts
The market would probably crash under Biden anyways, raising taxes and closing down the country again will have the same effects as it had in march

That was one gruesome bull trap at eod if this red doesnt fade overnight

My uncle stumbled upon a deal investing in housing in some South American country. Can't remember which. But anyways he was always the less successful in a successful family. So he goes all in, mortgages his house to do so, and convinced my dad to toss in 100k. Time goes by and the contact always has bs updates. Eventually it comes out the whole thing is a fraud. Everyone lost everything. At least when I lose my money playing FDs, I had a chance.

Gonna enter those 12/18s u have

I copped 20 1/15/2021 $260 calls for $40 each for the lols. gonna lose on this last one prolly, but i’ll cop the 12/18s and make it back and more

thanks for your input homie, appreciate it, read every word and should have had ur knowledge in my DD

also those shorter-dates 11/27s are ficking hot bro, omg if u copped when underlying was $208 in fucking hard dudep. nice job spotting obvious support.  hoping to see $215 before earnings, if lucky $220, then after i exit at $230/$240. 

wud be cool if by jan my $260s go ITM

Holy shit
Impulse decisions are usually wrong.. for instance, when you see a stock move down that you own your gut reaction will be sell and run to safety (realizing loss in the process). Ignore that feeling unless something has dramatically changed with the company/world.

Yeah, NIO would probably be best for partnerships. LI is cheap enough for acquisition right now. XPEV, who knows.

Also, developing in-house means wasted time. You wanna be early to the market, not 3 years from now.
They haven’t disclosed but I imagine it was higher than 2019. Even if it wasn’t, I still imagine it was 10x BLNKs. This is a no brainer. I fucking hope.

Or ban
Didn’t the market just crash in March? Isn’t that why were all here, trying to ride the wave until the next crash, when the smart dumb thing will once again be to buy the dip, then ride another wave? With the exception of idiots gambling their life savings on risky AF YOLOs who will be wiped out, many of us are waiting for another big buying opportunity. Which may be why it won’t happen. But then again, I have no idea what I’m talking about. 

All that said, hedging isn’t a terrible idea. Torn between SPY puts or buying into an inverse ETF. Suggestions anyone?
lmao SPY going straight step-function mode
Yes but if u can play it smart and grow ur account to 25+ then u can start real day trading

This is your post? A picture of the name of the company and you contributing nothing towards the tagged discussion? Is this the effort you put into your DD and sex life?

Hard pass on this entire post.
I made post yesterday about FUV asking why is nobody speaking about it and they made fun of it and the post was taken down.
Interesting that AH actually underpredicted the futures open move in terms of magnitude (as in in gapped down bigger than what AH implied).

Absolutely BOGGED
in my honest opinion, im a bull on both of these companies. Logitech has the broader market, being a gamer people buy logitech mice, headset and webcams. The last one was the big reason why i kept dumping into logitech, i saw that their orders for the c920 were back ordered because of the high demand. People only really know corsair for their keyboards. I know some people with corsair mice, but they dont compair anything to logitech. 

&#x200B;

for people who dont want to read that paragraph. this sums it up.

mice= logitech

headset= logitech

webcam= logitech

keyboard= corsair
TLDR; bought NIO calls
ay man all i can say is it depends on what option u buy. I got FISV 11/20 $110 calls for their earnings, ended up going -$1500 like you

but i held and it printed 12k

I think DG is gonna. have some CVS like earnings effect, different reasons like with CVS it was vaccine distribution, but DG has similar crazy $250/$260 price targets going into this earnings and i got a feeling something crazy will happen
Thats why i love wsb
Up 16.5% on KMI and it keeps going up on top pays 8% divvy
I have a feeling NIO, XPEV, and LI will be primary targets for partnerships and/or acquisitions by the big motors who are late to the game. It’s the big motors only play to compete with TSLA.
SPG leaps
46.8%. Haven't been at this level since August it seems
Had 30k worth 12.5c 3/21 sold it post earnings for a loss.

My fav of all of them is CIIC as the other fellow autist mentioned. What’s with FCEL? I don’t want to do any of the Chyna companies except BABA since I know they’re legitimately a beast of a company.

This is NOT a meme stock. Roblox is a cash cow. 

In the time of young children growing up during a quarantine, they go online to the most accessible game available. They join for free, but quickly discover that the coveted cosmetics cost a few bucks. Mom and dad think 2-3 dollars here and there can’t hurt. 

And when quarantine ends? Those kids are still loyal to the brand. Heck, teenagers and 20 somethings still play for the nostalgia. 

Im glad I can finally say “Long Roblox”
ewwww

what is it at right now?
He we all needed this stimulus really bad but when it didn't come in time, markets shrugged it off. Often nicer to look up when shit around you is ugly.
Just mash some orange play-doh into a pile and take a photo, basically the same thing
Yeah. But Lordstown will be producing vehicles sooner than NKLA, at lower cost, and with an eye towards fleets rather than individual consumers.
Quite frankly I haven’t done enough research. I wanted to get on the train but I think I have missed the train. 

Corsair is comparable to Logitech with better product line, aesthetically. Logitech has a PE of 20...so I’m not sure how much further Corsair can go.

That 1 mil volume candle today was definitely Ryan Cohen swinging his big ole dick in front of the GME execs. You can’t convince me otherwise
It's a lagging indicator. It explains why we rallied at close.

It does nothing to help bulls with the AH news and fuckery.
ahahah lmao yes. i will make sure to that next time
let it be red then and I'm balls deep in calls
If you just listen to his predictions from a few months ago they were horribly wrong. He said tesla growth story peaked , in q3 they reported record revenue. He said eu demand is gone, they recently had a record eu month. He said ev credits are going to 0, they have just made a deal with Honda for even more credits, he said they cant be profitable without credits- they were gaap profitable ex credits in q3. He said their fsd is vaporware- released beta version to public , he said battery tech isn’t proprietary- battery day. I genuinely think he has been wrong with every single thing he has predicted
lmao I remember doing this, it was a dark dark time.
Ooooh thats tasty
FOMO calls all day

Yea I’ve been with PLTR since IPO and being a (new grad) data scientist myself I’d be shooting myself in the foot if I didn’t believe in a literal data science company!

And yea I’m in WSB for the memes (and the occasional healthy discussion) to be quite honest. I’m finding my feet in the investing world and I’m yet to find a broker in the UK that doesn’t rinse me for trading options so I’m stock only for now. I’m having a lot of fun though!

You're definitely used to the retards in here because you're arguing something I'm not even saying. He pays 213K. The person he theoretically paid receives the money. I'm not disputing that... 213K exchanged hands. But now it drops to, let's say, 200K. That 13K is now essentially gone. I understand that the seller receives the full 213K. I was remarking on that fact that to the buyer, 13K is gone, but the seller doesn't get an extra 13K, they had already received that in the transaction. So now there is 13K that's just disappeared, even though, as you're saying, the seller received 213K. It was a minor point for making an analogy, but maybe you're just so triggered by the retards in here that you I assumed I was one of them.
You're right this summer in Breck we saw record demand. People want to travel and people don't want to listen to the government. Seeing this build up just feels like last March. If the county decided lodging is prohibited the resort is going to suffer.  


Thanks for the reply
Long term i.e. I'll buy shares in a year if it doesn't completely tank

What's happening:

Lockdowns are coming.  What kept the economy from going to shit?  The FED being able to backstop everything and loans being handed out.  Trump admin is removing all of that protection now.  And lockdowns 2 look like they're coming.  We all fooked.
Bruh, they did what they were suppose to do. Our economy is built on demand and debt. Literally printing money and taking out debt to buy stupid ass shit is the only thing keeping is growing (at slower rates for years btw).

Ok, I read this and I'm an idiot, but it all makes sense- and it is certainly true that the market is completely decoupled from any true economic measures or manifestations.   


So we're looking for a catalyst. I propose and would love to hear other thoughts on this theory: christmas ain't gonna be a christmas like we've ever seen. No travel. No family gatherings means less retail spending. Less restaurant sales, less travels. No stimulus until Biden takes office.   


I think 12/18 is a bit early for that reality to hit. I think first or second week of January.
You think you are? You are and One of us.
I said this about just short of three hours earlier before the bell...

“ I second the mango man dumping the market.

If not, then I see retail following the green ship into the close and then MM crushing every option in existence tomorrow for OpEx.

Perfect Setup. Didn’t shake me out of my VXX hedge. If neither happen, will go with trend an average down insurance hedge. GL. “

I didn’t consider that it’d be a statement from MNUCHIN that would conveniently be released just in time for OpEx. 

Mango man sitting back and watching the market tank though; that’s his way of saying FU to Biden.

Either up or down. Or maybe sideways.
I see it mentioned 10 days ago, lame

Nice you got the time on your plays
I just want to quibble with one point. OP argued that QE is deflationary, but didn't actually argue that. The argument is that QE doesn't do anything if the banks don't take advantage of it and lend more, which is true. While OP gave some anecdotal examples of places in which banks are tightening, this misses the big picture. 

[The velocity of money](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V) remains positive, if diminished from pre-crisis levels. This is a measure of the degree to which high-powered money created by the Fed circulates through the economy. Now, admittedly the velocity of money is getting very low, but the point is that you can safely ignore all warning signs and load up on calls for TSLA. You literally can't lose money. Ever. Come on, man - solar powered robot cars (or whatever)!
Weird way of saying 520
You’re fine. It has plenty of room to run and has been growing steadily. Stabilizing at each stop on the way up as well. It’s definitely still a buy under 20.

Yes I know I am poor, but why is the PDT rule a thing? Just let me keep my gainz🙃
come here retards. here is a strategy.

we already reaped the benefit of selling the put today. With $300 collateral, we reaped $25-to-$45, which is pretty good for 24 hours. 

ITC notice says, the decision is delayed and it will be on for Dec18. Once this initial optimism fades out and reaches to a plateau, we'll buy puts on it this time. I'm guessing Dec 18 $3c is a good entry point. Today it's $.78 per put contract, but it'll be way cheaper tomorrow. We'll buy these and ride it to mid December and then dump it.

Were you here in March?
I think skiiing is the safest mass activity there is because you are outside and spaced and probably wear a mask anyway. Unfortunately, the individual counties make the restrictions. Vail will do anything they can to stay open but Summit county, Eagle county, etc. make the call. The ski resort will probably stay open but if the county shuts down short-term rental which they are close to doing, no one will be there to ski. Also, Vail gets a significant portion of their revenue from lodging, food and beverage. That will be close to 0 all season. If Breckenridge ski resort stays open but short term rental and all bars and restaurant are closed, that might be the worst case scenario for Vail Resorts. Their daily operating costs would remain 100%, and their revenue would go down significantly.
Any chance we up tomorrow?

I have believed it the whole time. Worst timing to take my mom on vacation.  Still have 18 shares at 31.90
Oh I sold mine but just checking lol so puts tomorrow?
If you have cash waiting to invest and don't want to commit with shares, sell cash secured puts at the money, and close them early if the stock jumps a bit. Use that profit to buy additional shares. If you get assigned for some reason, well you wanted to buy more anyways right?
people ask the same question last year on Tesla
mango makes us money so no complaints. unless there's a way to buy calls on drone strikes, I'm not that excited about white obama
Fuck yeah

Mnuchin wants to end main street lending program, stop new purchases of corporate debt and requesting 455 billion returned markets down .4%. 

Chuck Schumer hopes that stimulus talks may resume, market up .5%. Somethings off XD

I can’t hear you over this rainbow of GO FUCK YOURSELF
Well said, haha. :(
So did Mnuchin pretty much just say fuck your stimulus?
futures aren't open yet that's probably why
As of now vail itself is fine. So you could be good! Tomorrow (in Breck) they’re rolling out 1 household per rental limits. So if you’re going with friends it would be going against the order. I have zero idea how they plan to enforce that but something to keep in mind if eagle county gets worse

Because I was holding a pile of shorts on it and/or someone knows something we don’t. If there’s no real causation behind this movement aside greed and sympathy to EV hype - it’s going to be an amazing short opportunity if you can time it right.

I think so too, but it doesn’t seem to have gotten much worse (lol) this year, and it’s easier to interview remotely.
I live in one of the biggest cities in the country. We have rush hour again. It’s hard to find parking spaces. The average citizen is, maybe, wearing a mask, but that’s it. And wearing a mask has no real impact on the economy. And there’s not one politician pushing shutdowns that’s following their own rules, except maybe Biden, and he’s a figurehead. 

Invest based on facts, not hype. And the fact is people don’t really believe the covid scare enough to skip the holidays or lose their jobs.  Again, I’m Not endorsing, I’m just observing. And profiting.

California lock down on this Saturday! All in calls!
If it’s any consolidation I lost over $10k on BABA calls this month.  And I was watching all day for a chance to  buy back and make some of my money back. It looks like it could go either way. Volume was down a bit which is not necessarily a bad sign, we will have to keep an eye out in the morning to see if this is going to hold... still a long way from breaking any real pivot points but if the momentum carries through tomorrow i see it going 280-290 before the end of the month.

I know I am right, but I don't know when I will be proven right. So I buy conservative short-dated puts and hope I'm right this time. If not I can buy Feb and March later. No need to pay more than necessary if we crashing next week.

JMIA 17 puts for next month? I have never shorted before, but it seems so easy at this price. Am I retarded?
I have a lot of confidence in CRSR. My average is $18 on the 700 shares. If the shares get called away at $45 I'd be okay with it.
DIX spiking to 46.8% would be more meaningful and very bullish if Mnuchin didn’t cancel the Fed brrrr after hours

Probably just that Mnuchin is asking the Fed to return the unspent Cares program funds. Less money for the Fed to buy bonds with.

Tsla just getting started at 500
Fuck whatd he do
I'll try it out. You think it's enough to drop it?
Whatd he do
The fucking person he bought it from got the money. All $311k of it. If you can’t understand that I can’t help you.
Sure is. If you have options, hold until the last day or so to maximize. If you got shares like me, take a fucking vacation for the next year and come out a millionaire.
My throat is sore

When Alan Greenspan says he has never seen anything like this I get worried
Why would you buy Puts on TSLA? 🤔
I almost didn’t see it, a whole $30 gain at one point, damn bruh should’ve cashed out
🤷‍♂️  

I don't think they qualify for any of the lending facilities, otherwise the wouldn't have been raising money by share dilution
✨the lil yachty prophecy is coming for the bulls✨
What did you do with the money?
* Fair value of common stock:  $4.61 - $7.92 

Are they serious? I mean, the company **earn** over $250 million in **2020**, up from the $110 million they earned last year.. a 127% increase year-on-year.

What would be a good value for the stock?
 Not as long as your insight might make me money
Ban
Cover the transfer cost? They better pay you to do it
Lol buy puts then retard
At 9:59pm PST its SAFE though.

It’s not euphoric until front page of this sub is painted w gain porn for 3 days straight. The 3rd day is when everyones yolo’d into weekly calls coz it worked the first 2 times and thats when u hit the exit door

There might actually be some retards in here and that’s why the general pervasive feeling about Wall Street and the stock market is that they are crooks stealing from retail investors, when this dude obviously just YOLOd his life savings into FDs for a company and expects 100% gains every day, lest it be a scam
DIX says tomorrow is green. But everybody who just went long I guarantee wasn’t expecting Mnuchin to drop that letter today. We’ll find out if it carries any weight soon.
Rip.

This reminds me of the posts of the dude whos wifes boyfriend recommended this sub and he was long aapl and his post hystory was full of posts of how to make his dick bigger with all the workouts and stuff

Funny thing: Did you know to "naturally" make your dick longer you need to do these "exercises" (jackoff) for 45 minutes straight everyday these motherfuckas  was doing handstands and jackin it ___ wow


Anyways good stuff!
This is why you gotta be in covid proof stocks like my boy NET.
What does that mean for the market?
Rotation back to tech
Pfuck that up*
You'll lose a less than $400 by not having a gf
Nah, 🥭's a cunt and we all know it.
i just saw that... i mean shit.... fuck it.
What did they say? Because i did watch it and I  didnt hear anything about "forced vaccinations"
At this point you either accept that NIO is going to $200+ and you’re on board long term or you’re a nonbeliever and you’re gonna miss out. No sense in trying to convince others at this point
I got in this morning premarket
Taking off from work tomorrow. Feeling like it's Friday. Man, this is a good day.

The pain is real
does bad mouthing mango still get you banned here? 

i dont want to go back to the gulags
Yeah pretty much
Im a big bear, but even i don’t see it. In reality from a technical perspective were in a bull market of a strength seen once a quarter century or so
You should sell if you can't take the loss.
Fucking brain dead retard 

U belong here you did this to yourself
NET has strong foundation with okay valuation compared to the other cloud companies with insane PE. While PLTR and DKNG still have decent run, I’m not so sure if CRSR can have a sustained run with its current product line.
At least he got 24.24% in boomer stock.
Honestly no, but it’s a free 3 grand for right now 🤠
It’s money that was expiring December 31 either way. The funds weren’t used. Government accounting is strange with appropriations and I don’t think the request by treasury to have the funds returns is an indication of some grand negative event. Everyone knew that there were excess funds remaining from the CARES programs which weren’t tapped that’s why they kept opening the restrictions on who could borrow wider in hopes more business would pull funds.

Go to Theotrade and watch all their free tutorials. 

Then don't do any options trading. At least you'll understand why you shouldn't.
Absolutely, just my opinion. If it was 11/27 I think it would for sure make money. You got 1 day to correct 10%. The momentum EV/green energy has had this week has been a train. I wouldn't be the one to step in front of it. Best of luck to you though! I doubled a NIO 1DTE put last thurs/fri, you might be able to do the same.
Hold up, I've seen these cars before

For the life of me I DO NOT UNDERSTAND how people think a company 17 years of age and billions of dollars invested in R & D founded by Peter fucking Thiel and who caught Osama Bin Laden is a scam stock.
Don't forget that after-tax 401k contribution if your employer offers it as well. I'm throwing in an additional $27K per year that way. 🤑
who got SPY calls?
I don’t know if there is a live stream
Kinda thinking this too, I am thinking second lockdown and what we saw on the german dax.  Huge fall but a quick correct.

Clown car company solo going the most ham of them all, I looked at that thing at 6,5 and  was like surely this mooning will stop soon, now it's past 9.
Jump in we are heading to the moon!
ohhhh faxxxxx?

Watch it go back to 33 next month. thank god I bought more two days ago and cleared the risk level today. Still holding a good amount.

Unsure about this in the short term. Long term it should do well.
those reporters lost their shit lmfao
F
lmaoooo
Why is it that you recommend trading in the first 30min only ? Also what about the end of the day that usual also has higher volumes no? Should one not buy the day before instead on the first 30 minutes?
lost 400$ and my gf broke up with me, shit just ain’t going well for me. hope you guys made some money.

Lots of room for growth. I set a trailing stop-loss as it increases to lock in profits. There is still a long way to go imo look at the market cap revenue and earnings.
I missed the start of the presser did trump talk at all in the beginning?
Prediction:  
  
Trevor Milton will sell off all his shares of **Tesla** competitor **Nikola** and use that money to move to China and create a new EV startup called **Neo**
LMAO. Deal. Only thing I worry about is Chinese New Year, haven’t played BABA enough to know if it’s even affected.
This is América not China, won’t happen imo. Trump is dump
ye i know but im just getting into trading and i would still appreciate if you could explain the terminology. I know spy is an etf and 360 is most likely price.
Big tech like MSFT, AMZN, FB, etc. It usually doesn't mean much unless it happens for weeks though. Also it won't mean much if like the entire market sells off. But this doesn't hurt though.
Can he sell this much? Or now he has to exercise?
NIO/XPEV/LI green in the sea of red AH. I have a feeling they gonna make big announcements during tonight’s auto show.
This seemed faster. However I was incorrect, but should have expected so. So that’s on me
After it goes up some, sell some of your calls to give yourself a buffer and invest in something else or hold.

You still have over a month on them.
I knew this plan was too good to be an original thought.
so much momentum
i swear to God if Sasha finally makes it on JRE im going to shit myself 🤦🏻‍♂️ yes thats a promise

this a beyond amazing post so im sure this comment will get buried but if you see this just know the biggest takeaway is that 99.26% of their third quarter net loss was from employee stock compensation. that is all.
Jesus Christ dude. If you’re balls deep in it then literally take 2 minutes of your life to google the company and basic business finances and see that it’s massively undervalued. It’s also less than 2 dollars from your strike with a month left.
What’s a realistic point where it would be smart to start taking profits on CRSR?

Rural retards . . . like New York, California, New Jersey, Illinois, and Massachusetts, five of the top seven states for COVID deaths. Or we could do it per capita (even though we were told not to do that when comparing the US to Europe) and you'd have NJ, NY, Mass, and Conn. as the top four. 

Maybe people value other things (mental health, child's education, etc.) more than preventing a disease that is very unlikely to kill them (or even their older relatives). Something can be tragic and not necessitate idiotic responses like "we have to try to save as many lives as possible." We don't say that for anything else.

Absolutely! It’s going to be a very interesting decade, happy to be making some money on the back of it! EV stocks are the Tech stocks our parents told us about

Yea but if you just buy the Jan 270 calls, it's a somewhat similar trade with actually a higher % payout if it does go to 280. If you buy ITM, it's actually almost the same type of trade except you just have theta decay. I'm probably more bullish on BABA than any stock I trade at this point. It's completely deviated from JD and other Chinese stocks.

Oh yea 100%, they’ve just got to make their way to the UK, which is why I’m long on NIO and Chinese EVs in general. NIO have already got a base in the UK. Just a matter of time before we shake up the old guards in the auto industry with fresher EV alternatives. The UK are making the right moves but our infrastructure is severely lacking, especially with a lot of households not having realistic access to a wall charger, NIOs battery swapping tech could be a real benefit here

We can't say 100% for sure, but all the indicators so far point to vaccination induced immunity being similarly good or better than catching covid itself. Definitely keep a close eye on continuing trials to see if this holds up, but the immune response looks better than most had hoped for.

These chains can easily borrow to stay afloat. And in the long run, they have inadvertently captured market share and can exploit newfound lack of competition because all the small-fry non-national restaurants got dicked hard and have shut down.

It’s like betting on your local Walmart during a local economic crisis. Sure no one is buying shit but it will be the only thing open when all the smaller local stores eventually close due to lack of customers and some customers will return when economy is better.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday sought the return of unused funds from the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending facilities but the central bank pushed back and said the programs served a vital role.

Mnuchin, in a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, sought a 90-day extension for four of the central bank’s emergency lending programs, but requested other programs expire on schedule on Dec. 31 and the Fed return $455 billion to the Treasury so Congress can spend the money elsewhere.


“The Federal Reserve would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy,” the Fed said in a short statement.

Mnuchin is going to redirect those funds into his pockets.

Warrants don’t have fees for purchasing, the person who replied to you was mentioning “units”, which are basically a combo-pack of a share and a fractional warrant. You can ask your broker to split the units into their separate parts, or you can just trade the unit for a similar value. 

If you want to just buy warrants though (which are the product of someone already splitting their units, and then selling the warrant), you can purchase them just like a share.
Due to your flair I see that I should safely swerve your advice
Same question. Is it to late?

**Model Y reliability woes put Tesla near bottom of Consumer Reports rating**

Consumer Reports gave the Tesla Model Y SUV a "not recommended" rating because of significant reliability problems, dragging the brand to near the bottom of the [magazine's industry-wide reliability ranking](https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2020/11/consumer-reports-identifies-mix-of-new-suvs-cars-trucks-that-are-dependable/).

The Model Y, the carmaker's newest model which [began production](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/04/business/tesla-model-y/index.html) at the start of this year, is expected to become [Tesla's best-selling vehicle](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/business/tesla-model-y-elon-musk/index.html). It got good ratings overall from Consumer Reports' staff during test drives earlier this year. But the reliability rankings are based on a survey of actual owners -- who reported significant problems. "A car might be great to drive and have all the features you want," said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, "but all that won't matter to you much if you have to keep going back to the dealer for repairs. "The problems with the Model Y ranged from misaligned body panels to mismatched paint. One owner reported dust, debris, and even human hair stuck in the paint. 

 Fisher said new vehicles often have reliability problems but Tesla's issues are unusually bad.

"It's some basic stuff they're not getting right, which is disappointing," he said. "It's disappointing that body panels are not aligned so they can't even shut the back hatch. It's disappointing the paint has so many problems. You'd think this is stuff they would be able to get right from the start."  
Tesla ([TSLA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&source=story_quote_link)) did not respond to a request for comment on the Consumer Reports rating.  
The Tesla Model S luxury sedan also dropped to "below average" reliability and is no longer recommended by Consumer Reports. The Model X kept its previous "not recommended" rating due to continued reliability issues**.**  
Only Tesla's Model 3 sedan, currently the company's best selling model, received a recommended rating from Consumer Reports.  
The problems with the Model Y dragged down Tesla's overall ranking two spots, to second from the bottom among all 26 ranked auto brands. Now it is ahead of only Ford's luxury Lincoln brand, and just behind Volkswagen, which finished last in 2019.  
"If the Model Y had similar reliability to the Model 3, Tesla would be mid-pack, it wouldn't be among the worst," Fisher said.  
Tesla also has received poor reliability ratings from [JD Power](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/cars/tesla-jdpower-rankings/index.html).  
Consumer Reports staff has often praised Teslas in their reviews separate from the reliability issues. The Model S achieved the [best score ever](https://money.cnn.com/2013/05/09/autos/tesla-model-s-consumer-reports/index.html) for a vehicle reviewed by the staff.  
The disconnect between the strong review of the Tesla vehicles by staff and the poor reliability ratings from its survey of owners has been a continuing challenge for the company.  
"This isn't our judgment, it's \[the\] judgment of Tesla owners," said Fisher. "If the reliability improved, I would be very happy to recommend Teslas. They're satisfying and really fun to drive. They're good for the environment. We hope our feedback helps them improve these problems."  
Tesla customers remain incredibly loyal to the brand, despite the issues raised in the survey. "The exact same people who tell us they love their Tesla are telling us about the problems with their cars," Fisher said.

Tesla wasn't the only carmaker with reliability concerns. Lincoln was hurt by issues with its new Aviator and Corsair SUVs.

And the new version of the [Ford Explorer](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/12/business/ford-explorer-recall/index.html) SUV also suffered from serious reliability problems that made it one of the lowest scoring models from any manufacturer—domestic or foreign—this year.

Owners of the Explorer reported numerous transmission replacements, along with problems affecting the SUV's drive system, in-car electronics, power equipment and engine and body hardware problems.

The least reliable vehicles according to the ranking were the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and its GMC version, the Sierra. The Toyota Prius was the most reliable.

Toyota lost its ranking as the most reliable brand as Mazda captured the top spot for the first time.

Every day is different, if there was a specific and consistent pattern, the people would adjust their behavior and the pattern would no longer exist. 

The only pattern that is relatively consistent, is inflated prices AH or PM on “hot” SPACs and warrants. Prices then fall when volume picks up surfing trading hours. This doesn’t always happen though, since sometimes the stocks rise based on normal market buying and you don’t get a dip.

Good luck!

The thing is, Norway is a rich country and they have a ton of government subsidies and perks for driving electric cars. It’s easy to sell to Norway. The UK on the other hand are atrocious and considering most people here either drive a city super mini or a crossover/fake SUV, there are none currently that can realistically fit the bill for the majority of the population in terms of price to performance. I’d say 80% of people buy their cars used from anywhere between 5000-30k with the Model 3 coming in close to 40k starting

What's your puts option and exp?
Hope u tards hedged, it's already saved me once this week
It’s a stock, it doesn’t have an expiration date.
I got burned yesterday for being a pussy and missed out on some real nice gains.  Today I decided to not be a pussy and diamond handed my options and got burned.  Pretty much blew up the last of my account.  However, I sold my SPX puts that expire in the a.m. during AH because the puts would not print unless the S&P opened below 3,510.  It also ensures I have some cash for tomorrow since my cash deposit won’t be available until next week.  That kind of drop overnight just seemed really unlikely, but then the S&P continued to drop AH.  I’m going to lose my fucking shit if it opens at or below 3,500.
Even with some assumed dips, BABA 1/15 calls should print, no? I can finally afford some nice options, so highly considering it some ITM calls.

>  Even the media and politicians beating the panic drums the hardest take of their masks in private, or for riots, or to celebrate Biden, or for fundraisers... NO ONE actually believes the hype. Which is maybe dumb, but it means we’re not shutting down.

Trade only during the first 30mins after market open. Take your profits (if any), set a stop loss to prevent this.
Always read your chart, rsi, bullish/bearish div and volume before taking a position. That way you’ll prevent this in the future. Also don’t buy same week, buy at least 2-3 weeks away to avoid theta burn give and chance to recover (if u don’t know what you’re doing)and it dips.

Now that it's clear that's where the future is going, there's going to be a huge market incentive for every corporation to get there first and claim market share. Whether it's for vehicles or for charging stations. Companies see the writing on the wall and they don't want to be left behind.

Can you imagine trying to be respectful of mango +pence without wanting to burst into laughter or roll your eyes so hard your contacts pop out of your eyes.
Hey man I'm currently a bear as well. I have spy 290 marchs. Let's get this bread.
Unless Tesla is paying a ton to use those I don't think China would go for it. There isn't any competition between Tesla and the Chinese EV currently, but once that starts they don't want Tesla using their distribution channels.
Yes it helps me understand names that move together/move independently from each other. Obviously, all names have some correlation to SPY too, but if we get rid of the SPY beta, it's nice to know say PTON/ZM/CRWD/CHGG/DOCU/ZS/TDOC (and like 30 other names with Amazon being like on the edge of these 30 since it's not as strongly correlated with it also being big tech) all belong in the "stay at home" basket. 

It helps say you know ZM has earnings coming up. You might be able to get a much cheaper IV call on say CRWD knowing if ZM moons, CRWD will too. This helped last time but MM probably will catch on this time so I'm expecting really high IVs across the board this time around. But like overall it's more useful for hedging and making sure my pnl is fairly balanced and doesn't have wild swings because I'm so overleverged one sector which all move together.
Honestly think you’re fucked lol, good luck though

You forgot not buying a ticker convinced its too overbought, on the way down, the fools. And it spends the entire day aiming for the moon.

Source: me not buying tesla 460c wednesday? When it was toying with 452. >_<
Doesnt shorting it imply that you want the underlying asset at a lower price? 

Does anyone even want SOLO? I have 500 shares just to ride the pump, and I plan on getting out immediately.

The “correcting” won’t happen; since the merger price is at $56 there’s little chance it’ll dip more than 1 or 2 dollars below that unless the deal is off. But alas, as regards these law firms, no one seems to have a clue as to their intentions or likelihoods of success

Smart woman.  I would like to have sexual relations with your mother
The problem is, if that's the most compelling reason you have to buy a stock.. you can't think much of it in the first place?

You can surely find better reasons to buy a stock? The number of investors who wouldn't buy because the price is too high would be a rounding error, insignificant.
Same someone explain
Probably not, but I have a policy of not fomoing back into former plays if I escaped with a good profit. It would be hard to stomach giving it all back.

So Google pays Apple, and as a response, Apple is going to expend more of its capital and cut out Google so a double whammy. 

Not saying it's inconceivable if they feel they can corner more of the market on security (that being said it's damn near impossible to avoid Amazon, Google, Msft, and FB on the back end) but there is some intense calculations to dedicate to that. The data they could extract does have some value, but would be self defeating if they're selling it instead of Google. 

You probably would see DuckDuckGo as an acquisition target prior to dumping google. 

Again, I don't understand the machinations that would propt this decision unless Google is about to get raided on a couple fronts and Apple wants to isolate themselves.
Like far down though

Went to Colorado last March for my annual snowboarding trip.  Got there, dropped hundreds on food, unpacked said food, cracked open a beer and turned on the news.  Within an hour I was planning my trip home.  Vail mountain was the first to shut down and all others followed suit within a day or too. This was during the winter...during the beginning of Covid.  Why would they not shut the mountains back down EXACTLY like they did last year?

I live downtown in a small city. The area around me is designated for Low Mileage Vehicles now. I can't get to a grocery store yet, but when I can, I'm getting rid of a car and picking up a golf cart. May get the golf cart soon anyways if SOLO keeps going.


My point being, I see a TON of golf carts already in my neighborhood.  I think people that live in suburban and rural areas are discounting how much urban folk would love something just to scoot around in.

Your position size is wayyyy to big if you get upset about losing. Losing is part of this game. You'll never be  a good trader if you can't stomach losses.

But if you are at this point that you describe you need to seriously deleverage yourself and stop yoloing. Play it safe again until you build up some confidence. It sounds like your death rolling to see if something sticks. That's bad  you'll blow out your account

Is the point of your main graph that we closed above second rejection prior to Pfizer news, or that it's all to easy to ignore higher lows while talking about lower highs? Convergence pattern based on stim/wh uncertainty, followed by answers and positive vaccine news equals a breakout. Not rocket science.

Its the pump fest before December. Insiders can sell their shares soon. No news about the nikola GM deal yet...hmmm thats strange. I'm sure they won't release it with perfect timing so they can dump their shares into strong retail buying. That'd be such a coincidence.

Wait for the news release this shit will pop, then short the shit out of it.

That is the definition of a crash. A crash doesn't mean the end of capitalism or the world, you millennial moron. A dip is just a correction.
How stupid and a novice can you be calling 08 a dip? Indicies falling by 50% or more, and prices of individual stocks crashing by 90% or companies going BK, like two historic IBs such as Lehman and Bears, both which survived the Great Depression, is not a little dip.

What’s happening ?
This is how earnings go anymore.

Great earnings come out -> Stock is bought up.

Call happens that give the gory details -> Stock sold.

Investors mull on the complete report and implications -> ????

The week following earnings seems to be more telling about how investors feel about it. I've seen plenty of companies beat well on earnings, sell of the next day or two, and then build up over the follow week.

If you're goin to play earnings, especially a Thursday PM one, I'd buy options with expiries 1-2 weeks later.

People are misunderstanding the use case. It’s a second car for tech yuppies, a short distance delivery vehicle and a ride for single person day trips so you can park in fucked, dense urban environments like SFO or NYC. 

Europeans will also be all over this thing. 

It’s a very specific niche and use case - it’s moat is that Tesla and others won’t even bother trying to crush them because it’s not worth the trouble. 

I’m still not sure I’d buy it over 10 bucks - but I regret selling my 2.40 shares for 4.40 right now. I was anticipating a dip and that never materialized.
Dead wrong. Have you seen the Fed balance sheet? CARE’s act renewal is priced in. The mango admin has given J POW every $ request. This is a Mango tantrum to burn the place down. It’s not catastrophic news, but a few MM’s pulling back in this fragile Enviornmental and sht could get bad fast.
I hope not...the volume was still there today

You have to read my post again to understand what I said. I mentioned BA wasn't in IWM. It's all about the correlations, not what's actually in which index. I only brought BA because it's one of the few non-tech names that could have liquid AH volume.

Plus it's way too early. Futures haven't even opened. You could see some jumps around 6 in AH SPY either direction.

Bro if you have 100 shares of anything why aren’t you selling CCs? Sell far OTM if you don’t wanna be assigned. You might only make a few bucks, but isn’t that better than not making a few bucks?
They all lost their savings already
I’ve been lucky the past two years not afraid of tomorrow lol
This. There is a volume of 40M shares traded today. No fucking way this is retail. It's jumping up in AH/PM not as much during the day. This is MM playing with this for some reason, probably a glitch in the algo.
You can get a whole new set of bags to hold!!!!
Did you write this like a retard to illustrate the point?
You should sell while you're ahead. Their market cap is only 700M and the stock is at $10. That's giga inflated. NIO is almost 1:1 for stock price and market cap ($ to bil). I can't see it rallying for much longer before a big crash
Of course :))

Mnuchin putting a lid on corporate credit facilities,  municipal, term asset-backed and main street facilities -- keeps the funding market backstops -- watch credit ETFs for any "facility taper tantrum"

I refuse to make a choice that looks to be giving 🥭 any credit for this. He's done and no longer has the effect he once had.
I remember that interview. He was talking about how wearing a mask could be worse because you're always messing with it
SOLO pumpers are the same clowns that were adamant that Smart Cars are cool.  Yeah, $18,500 for a tripod freak clown car where you'd get turn into roadkill in an accident.  What is this, Mario Kart in real life?
It’s good if all you want it for is gaming. And even then, it’s ray tracing is atrocious compared to the 3070 and then for productivity, CUDA is king for deep learning tasks and we’re yet to see AMD come up with a healthy alternative that’s actually well supported (by PyTorch specifically). If all you’re using it for is gaming then yea, fantastic card, but I’d probably pay the extra $70 for the XT

fuck yeah. load me up. I took like 4 vaccines once in a day because i was traveling to a country that needed stuff like yellow fever and boosters and then i went out drinking (5 whiskeys and I was so sick.

He said NO LOCKDOWN!

prolly has calls.
are we drilling because of munchkin?
Greed is against his will


So yeah prob
Yes I mentioned correlation to IWM. Like airlines/BA correlate more to IWM than MSFT (which I know you have a lot of 😂). I know no IWM name is actually in SPY but many names correlate to IWM more than to QQQ within SPY. 

I actually have a matrix for this so I can understand rotations better for trading. It's been somewhat helpful for trading although we both need MSFT to go back up.
AMD drops below $85 tomorrow to expire all those 85c options.

Holy fuck the gay bear dd was right
The Fed’s cor­po­rate credit, mu­nic­i­pal lend­ing and Main Street Lend­ing pro­grams won’t be re­newed, Mr. Mnuchin said Thurs­day.

Fed­eral Re­serve Chair­man Jerome Pow­ell had in­di­cated in re­marks Tues­day that he didn’t think it would be ap­pro­pri­ate to al­low the pro­grams to ex­pire.

“The Fed will be strongly com­mit­ted to us­ing all of our tools to sup­port the econ­omy for as long as it takes un­til the job is well and truly done,” Mr. Pow­ell said. “When the right time comes, and I don’t think that time is yet or very soon, we will put those tools away,” he said.
This is the way
I like you
Dec calls it is!

Not necessarily you will have ups and downs and have to manage your positions still. When stock prices go up you could lose out. Buy and hold could do better but who knows. Sometimes you just have to get lucky

Jerking off with my Cambodia girlfriend
I think Ackman has too much on his shoulders to not make this go off. After this recent March crash thing with the RIDICULOUS hedge bet, all eyes are on this dude to consider him a future hotshot. 

He has too much on this to let it be subpar/fail. Of course, I have a lot riding on this too, but super excited to see where it goes.
Ho Lee Fuk. These guys are really gonna burn the house down on the way out

I don’t think I’ve personally heard anyone say that coronavirus isn’t real...  I’ve heard plenty of people say it’s blown out of proportion, though...  Cases increasing is manipulated data, number of true deaths is manipulated data, etc.

Yea.
You put in all that work writing this just to hold positions in weeklies. No serious trader of 20 years would ever have weeklies. 

Only college kids gambling with their student loans would.
Why would it pop though? Oil & Gas is fucked cause of lockdowns, EVs got a fuckton of tailwind. Year over year growth is exponential, they are essentially a tech play

I hope PFE gets fucked they burned me with the pump and dump

I lost out timing the market in march. Sold my port on March 18th (I think March 20th was the literal bottom) and it will bother me way too much forever. What helps is I made a bunch on puts on the way down but never made that turn. I’m more or less a perma bull for life and will never sell my whole port again lol

The lessons you learn losing out on gains
What'd he say?
lmao.

I bought a December 18 Solo 9 strike put when it was at $8.30 for 2.4.

I sold the 9 put when it was at $9.70 for 2.2

The put didn't buy the fact that Solo was rising.
Lol all the limit down and rug pull talk makes my SPY calls so happy to see around here

Fauci about to pump this shit
First of all, that's 100% false and sounds like some Facebook spam bullshit. Reagan started a war, Bush 1 started a war, and Bush 2 started a war.

John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did not.



Second of all, it's weird af to claim people are hypocrites simply because Trump didn't start a war, as if they had argued that he did. Doesn't even make any sense.
What does this mean
They probably have moved the same % as SPY AH (see like a BA, JPM, etc.). Most of the other hard hit COVID stocks don't have meaningful AH volume since spreads are so wide no one will really trade.
Saw it on WSJ
11/20 I SEE U MMS 

WELL PLAYED
would anyone here actually take a vaccine
Holding 1/21/22 3C , see you in a year
Because Feb/March is me going off of his '2 months tops' comment. If it's at the tail end of that 2 months, he's already blown through his shitty SPY350 calls. See my point? His positions don't line up with his words. 

If I think the market dies within 2 months, why the fuck am I going to buy puts 1 month out, when MY OWN DD says it could float on another month?
everyone keeps saying Mnuchin fucked everything but I wouldn't know since all of my cash is in PLTR and nothing stops the fuckin PLTR train, not even Mnuchin.

I made some off it when it was $10 but got back in a lot more when it was $17 and controlling 3k worth of shares.

If I went in shares at $18 I would net 344% if it hits $80 a share but if I went with Jan 2023 $10 calls I would hit roughly 483% so I went with the leaps instead.

I got 11/20 350s 🤞
Yes it is. The "correlated" small cap names that are in SPY but not IWM. Like a BA probably has moved down more than AAPL/MSFT AH and I don't need to look. Yes BA is not a small cap name but it correlates to IWM/DIA more than QQQ.
PFE AND MRNA are the ones to be in right now. Mango will absolutely push to get these 2 approved before his term is up.

There might be a reason for that, and it's still not even that cheap.  $180 or so, for TSLA to move 60% in 3 weeks.  You could have just bought 180 lottery tickets and have better odds.
PFE, MRNA, JNJ, RGEN, AZN.... BUY CALLS TOMORROW. Going to be a rotation of vaccine/therapeutics pumps over the next 4-8 weeks.

How much money did you make today bud?
Can't go tits up
Alright I finally
Blew up my account. It was fun boys. I’ll see you in a few months Godspeed retards
Anything it takes to achieve mod status 😪
How so?
I think it's a little bit more of a long play than some might think.  Q3 earnings come out in December and they might disappoint there.  The Q4 earnings which will include the new consoles and the bulk of Christmas spending won't be out until next year.
I think it’s a solid play. FCEL pumps about once a month, dips to shake, trades flat, then pumps out of nowhere again. It inexplicably dies around ER like clockwork, but you’ll be a month early for that. Still, first red dildo you see with volume make sure you cut those or at the very least sell puts above your cost for credit spread.
No one cares what either of those guys have to say
PLTR is just getting started. 🤑📈
Mnuchin fucked all the bulls
I'm not gonna ask her, but if I had to imagine what she'd say, it would be "There's about to be another housing bubble, invest in something that isn't tied to real estate."
It's march 2020
Somebody should tell him that doesn't help
Guy Adams pulls this shit too often.
Futures drilled just now as an indication MM’s are preparing to fuck 11/20 expiry.

How do you sleep at night?
Fauci about to light this fucking shit on fire.
Lighting really is everything to being successful on Instagram
This EV bubble pop is going to be insane.
How do you know?

Mnuchin is trying to tank the market
SPY near all time highs, yet still lots of unemployment and threat of more and more COVID lockdowns.  'WHY SPY GOIN DOWN?'
As much as i know that will happen im so fucking deep in tech. There is something wrong with me.  Buying calls outside of tech just doesnt feel right
Think the JP downgrade will keep it pinned?
If ROST holds overnight; would be a good one to short in the morning. Stores are garbage and they don't carry Ralph Lauren.
honestly.. you’re probably right
He should probably stop talking like he has a crystal ball then

Holy fuck SPY limit down bears might actually have their positions print
If you haven’t lost all of your money, no.
How about his hot sister Grape?
he sure does stand straight.
dont lose brother
To add on to this, I can see why Americans are turned off so much by the look of the SOLOs lineup, but in very dense metros around the world, they may be able to offer an effective product.
I'm fairly confident that SPY isn't moving because of small caps.
thank you. So, the calls are a fine idea then?
Great, MM's can't tank the market with all the "young dumb investors" buying every dip so they have to do it after hours
So my calls can print
Hard hit COVID stocks barely moved
I thought the liberals didn't believe in TFSAs?
ALL that work for a $350 SPY Put?  Where's your 12/18 SPY $200 yolo dad?
I like how they only have 3 employees. Fuk it all in.
Well. They releasing new model tonight, so I’m sure it’ll explode tomorrow if that model is next generation.
all the weak hands sad and dont want to talk about it.
You could respond to my comment too, edit included, and my logic for your dumb ass positions in the following comments. 

You're either:

- Not fully invested in your own DD
- Bullshitting your positions
- Actually retarded
- All of the above
thats bullish retard

stimmy
I'll take the 900% I made. In since 1 dolla. But yeah, time to drop it.
I thought this box was the twitter. Somebody get me my twitter box.
So glad my dumbass 💎 🖐 my VXX calls
My post came right before the 20% dip lol
Sell your house and buy more calls into it :)

That’s insane that this dropped ah and thanks for sending it my way

Is that why they had a pop? Shouldn’t this cause a drop? So this means the lockup period will end aka institutional investors can sell if they want to
> She's pretty ugly

Wait, she has a face?
We've been dumping since November 5th
!remindme 2 months
2400. But I lost 3k on Monday, 3k on Tuesday, 2.9k yesterday. So it is what it is. Ill take it. Also, Robinhood owes me 3k so there's that.
I bought a December 18 Solo  9 strike put when it was at $8.30 for 2.4.

I sold the 9 put when it was at $9.70 for 2.2

The put didn't buy the fact that Solo was rising.
No
Anything below $20 is a bargain
Is pic a play?
downvote me
What’s the prediction tomorrow
You also cant sell calls against puts dude
BRUH chop ur hands rn
?

Because I'm retarded?
Pre split. I figured I’d buy back in because Tesla always goes up and down. Except that time. That time it only went up.

Edit: remember these were the days papa Elon smoked weed on tv and threw down with pedo divers on Twitter.
Federal lending programs not being renewed
I’ve been holding 11/23 350 I’m praying
Oh I know it will but people want profits and this thing will probably see a pretty decent sized sell off overnight.

I’m going to make a bet that TSLA and shitcoin are going to reach new ATH’s sometime next week. Possibly on Monday and then have a huge correction right after.
ACB

What does that mean? The Fed does not enter into positions
I am a simple man.
Fidelity. App sucks but research and trade assist is huge. Plus customer service is top notch
I’m in Maryland.
VTRS. it’s a 4 star company. 100% mooning tomorrow as it did today. If you don’t buy at open, you’ll miss out.
Trump said fuck yo couch. Mnuchin of course being the messenger. he's about to crash the markets so as to not give Biden what he thought was his ticket to re-election

Mnuchin wants to take JPOW's money back.
So my SPY 345p 11/27 would’ve printed after all

Mnuchin sent a letter to the Fed ending CARES act program funding.
Made a rookie mistake buying pltr at today’s high. Now left bag holding and the pump isn’t even making the price go up enough
Where do you get these news?
less than .5% lol hold on to your putz
dude share the love wtf
I guess boeing was not the way
Look up Julie Cash with Alison Rey bruh
Bullish, he wants to redeploy the funds since they're not being used (we think)
Trump is great for both bulls and bears. You can't tell me he didn't direct order Mnuchin to end those programs. Feeling pretty good about my puts now.
You should have written puts.

My aliexpress orders taking forever, the sellers dispatch immediately as they always do but the shipments are stuck at warehouses for a week or two then the airlines can't figure out when to actually fly them out after accepting. A month ago it was taking 10 days, I'm estimating 30 now. Bullish?
This sub is actually surprisingly informative. It might have mitigated the severity of the crash.
The liquid tech stocks which are the only stocks that really have meaningful AH volume barely have moved (why QQQ isn't falling off a cliff). The entire SPY AH move is from small caps/correlated names + the hard hit COVID stocks (see the way IWM is falling vs QQQ).
Oh shit you’re the same guy, was only gona use that comment this one last time, I mean uh....... Beep Boop Bop

Sell on monday or tuesday. Lock it in.
I take it all back because you at least have the sense not to have voted for Biden.
HAHAHAHAHA to your puts
Why buy feb march puts if hes confident its gonna crash in two months? He gets more bang for the buck and hes within his risk tolerance  
Not saying its gonna crash i just dont see why u hating on his bearish positions, hes gonna make fucking bank if hes right anyway
Do you even read the articles? Its for a stimulus
I feel you
Crap
trust the process
No more lending from the treasury
Don't think you need fancy palantir neural networks for that. 

Each state knows the demographics of every zipcode in their state. Get counts for all age groups and distribute available doeses to local health departments accordingly. 

That's just like a sql query
But thats bullish though
Bro it's NNN gtfo
I'm right there with you. I LOVE the tos desktop app but it is intimidating as fuck. The RH website is terrible for me. 


I opened a small position on tos for right now to become more comfortable with it, but I prefer RH charts and how visible Buying Power is throughout the UI.
Cuz you’re right

So this is what it’s like to be rich

Very bullish
Just looked it up, rh does not support warrants
Should have bought one Tesla call closer to the money 🤦🏾‍♂️
Why are we dumping ?
I hope, CIIC barely moved after open
APPL OR AAPL?
The fuck are you holding them then?
Sarah Jay
Side bet a massive chunk of those 80 million are fake?

I will bet my account, if Biden is in on Jan 21 I will delete my account, if not you delete yours? 

Deal?
yup lol. I'm so glad I put some $ in tsla tho.
What does the 'm' next to the numbers mean?

Holy fuck why is SPY crashing AH
smart man. i just went shares instead at the beginning. definitely regret not getting in w/ options but i can't be mad at 4300 shares at a 13.74 average.
Only do that if you’re willing to live stream your reaction (and post that later) here, especially if you lose, that takes real ovaries, or are you’re a woman only Monday-Thursday and a man?
if you’re a real woman you’d make your kids dinner when the market closes while live streaming. Make us feel better mom, we like to see you suffer
Was looking at them. They just bought a big beer company
it will if it splits enough times
It's literally the implied annualized move based on options prices lol

So it's +/-
50% in stocks, sometimes 100% and will buy options  if the markets down.  But I live below my means, have no debt,  and make a lot of money.  I only live off about 15% of my income.
Strike and exp?
Bears are fucked by Chinese papa
Nio is going up because Biden will now down to China. How is that a good thing?

Tesla is going up because everything benefits from an economy that isn’t shut down retard. No one is gonna buy cars if they don’t have jobs.
Are you kidding I inverse myself
Same reason ACB blew up for a bit
Wtf, why do we have military people this short in leadership positions?
would you rather be short and fat; or short, fat and retarded?
thank you brother
This stock pisses me off. Looked at pulling the trigger at 18 20 22 and 24. Everytime I thought, nah it'll pull back.

FML.

Thankfully I have been holding a huge position during palantir during the same time period.
I was thinking about a 50-60% YOLO because I don’t want to lose everything, but that’s not a bad idea. Too bad it takes 30 days to transfer

Then why is he talking like his DD is Gods gift to us in the post?
What exactly is going on here.
So do we have any idea why SPY is nosediving? Don’t get me wrong, I’m on some GB poots but I would have taken that Confrence as a positive
Shouldn't the first clue been that they already had an agreement in place?

When are these retards going to leave the market?

How can anyone invest when so many dumb @$$es are pp of the price of stocks for no good reason?
I'm glad it's the + version, I don't think my eyes could handle the regular version
I’m here for the memes

Get into cash or buy puts if you can, Black Friday tomorrow
Just open spreads when you hit your profit threshold, either debit spreads on calls or credit spreads on puts.

Goddam, SPY is crashing. Protect your gains with PLTR.
Idk how yall watch that political speech shit

I lock in gains first 15 minutes of every opening day and dive back in with fewer contracts and diversify. Calls are mixed between 11/20 and 11/27
I’ve held a position to a 100% return. Normally I would’ve bought and panic sold and rebought 69 times within that.
Spy dumping because Mnuchin is not extending CARES ACT Lending programs, which Powell said needs to be extended
No CARE’s $. Mango just took our safety net. Fed is not happy.

I bought shares of CCL right after the big covid crash. So what do u think? Hold or sell? It does have a big upside .. 3-4x if fully recovered. But i cant really hell if its a risky investment or not
Why is SPY dumping?
I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING.


For real though, fucking relieved. Accounting Theta, I expect that at minimum I'll be breaking even. In which case, I'll have to gamble something else before the New Year.

If you're so confident it's gonna blow up, just skip the second round and buy Feb/March puts now for tech/SPY and sell 2/3 months dated calls.

If you're that confident you're right, you and your kids retire in April.

What stocks did she make most of her gainzzz in? 

Impressed...
So far looking good!!
The stock market is going to be there as long as you are alive. Don’t sweat one bad trade. Learn from it. For instance, I learned early to buy all calls in multiple of 2. That way if I feel a dump or anything I can always take out half my money for profit but leave the other and set a stop loss. This way I can always walk with profit.
40% to retirement, 5% to my investment portfolio and 5% toward general saving
Gay bear alert
Anyone notice that TSLA and shitcoin charts are weirdly similar? Hmm something is going on here.
They spinoff two companies last week. Forgot the exact adjustment to share price but that $42 (pre spinoff) is much lower now

I have 300$ to invest. You know 3 cheap stocks that will give me profit? Would appreciate it.

Should we be buying long dated puts in spy and other etfs? I imagine big tech like aapl and amzn would have the best chance to crash the hardest.

Good report though. 

Could run tomorrow
New rule for me. See 100% gain. Take 100% gain. 

Will probably get back there on these TSLA 12/4 525c, but would rather have that money in my account.
considered it, but the premiums are (or were) insane and I know nothing about the company

Uh yeah, they did. That pump turned this whole sub bullish.
How much of your take home pay do you guys put in your savings and retirement? I’ve been doing 10 to 15% in savings and about 25% in retirement and it feels like I’m just treading water

I will bet you 50% of my portfolio we don't go anywhere near there

This is the way.
He does make good money, but if i'm so confident that the market dies within 2 months, I'm selling calls, and loading up on Feb/March puts for every tech company on the planet, SPY, and companies with shitty financials. 

I'm not buying SPY 350 puts at 1 month expiry. That tells me he's leaving a lot of room for error that he either knows about, or worse, doesn't know about and knows he's retarded.
Yeah that’s fair, i was looking at 0dte weeklies for this post mostly haha
If you have a large cash position, start selling TLT puts against it. It’s literally free money.

This is literally the best time to buy CIIC, merger with Arrival expected to close Q1 of 2021, and production of orders starts Q4 of 2021.
Plus they already have 1.2 billion in orders lined up including from UPS
pointless yea...I just don't see AMZN getting to like $5000 since I've never seen that happen before...yet they are that capable of a company...feels like people would buy in more at a lower price.
I mean there is unprecedented money printing in the US. Very little inflation. Same with BOJ in the past. I think printing money into the real economy would be much more inflationary that's not really what the fed is doing.

Is the market gonna be red tmmr because of the task force briefing?
Im banned til Feb 23
Your lines are TERRIBLE and dont even follow the peaks
Look at the SPY chart.  I mean just look at it.  You think it's going to blow past all time highs based on stimulus hopes that now as ever have no chance of passing until mid January at least?  Worst Covid levels yet and lock downs resuming.  

At the very least you'd say we're going sideways, but definitely not up.
Yes. Big red
Yeah market will still be there without you dude.  Just sell all the things and take a week or two off to help clear your head and remember what life is.  You’ll perform better when you come back too.
I like the ideas. But I think we squeeze a bit more. Timeline is a bit too short imo. Also macro outlook depends on inflation expectations or not.
Why does RKT always let me down?

Worst part I was up like 20% on these calls like 3 separate times and now I’m nearly 50% down 🤦‍♂️
Where is NIO going to?

Not talking about FNMA.  I'm talking about the investment banks that actually buy in these loan originations.

This has been all over the news.  Not sure how you could possibly miss it.

JPM has raised from 620 FICO and 5% down to 700 FICO and 20% down.  If you want to refinance a jumbo, Wells wants you to have a $1m balance, up from $250k, and they cut LTV on loans by 5%.

These are just two examples.

Think buying calls hoping for Pfizer vaccine emergency approval in the next two weeks is a bad play? They're submitting a request tomorrow. Last time they had vaccine news they mooned to $42. 11/27 40c are like $0.08 and 12/4 are like $0.80. I'm trying to find out how long the turn around for approval is.
You forgot where it jumps up for the first hr tho before the sell off.

Shares? Where do you think you are, boy?
because they realized buying options with 350 IV is a stupid idea, but only after the fact.  now they gotta pump the shit out of solo so that it makes 80% swings, just so that they can make a small profit off of insanely priced options.

I’m looking at DIS calls for 2021. In addition to the obvious arguments (huge IP library, online and offline rev streams, don’t bet against the mouse), I think centralized spaces like arenas, malls and theme parks will reopen quickly and with the fewest hiccups, since they will be able to set consistent protocols. Im already in SPG and MGM and they printing. 

I’m thinking like 160c for March idk 

What you guys think

Of course. But that's a tall order. I meant more washing hands etc will reduce seasonal cold, flu and gastro illnesses which reduces primary care/hospital visits which then reduces health expenditures. Of course insurance companies will pocket that difference. Even the aca 90/10 rule can be avoided by "spending".

60-80 would be bold in 3-4 months but not impossible. I'm hoping for 100 dollars per share by the end of 2021.
Appreciate the input, my calls went up a nice chunk today so maybe I'll roll them out further. Still confident on those June calls though, especially with their incoming increase in mining production H1 '21. Listening to CNBC talk about coin is cringe, they think it has to operate like a stock and fill in gaps but ignore the underlying drivers that will continue to force the price higher. Mining costs are high, and many miners are in China and are forced to constantly sell in order to cover their costs, so there's a hard floor on how low it can go and no real upper limit as public adoption continues to increase.
I love how people think drawing a line between two points is a trend.

Can you give me link to understand PLTR business?
She’s a cringinator
It's because bulls talked endless shit when there was a little fake stimmy pump, so now they feel embarrassed that it sold off like 30 seconds after close, right after they loaded up on calls.
Oh fuck my bad. Carry on.
I sold my 11/20 7.5c this morning once it broke even. Shit fucking flew after that wish I stayed in. Still got some 12/18 10c and shares that made me a good bit today though.

I have 11/20 spreads open and I’m keeping them open all of tomorrow and probably buying calls at EOD for December. That boy is hitting 500.
Sold 7 CRSR 45c Dec 2021 covered calls for 1100 each. Seemed pretty good to me.

Not worried at all over tiny AH volume. Really gonna do my best this time around to sit on my shares long term. I'm 26 and looking back it will be so obvious that I should be buying EV stocks right now.

Also in on BIK before their merger is officially announced. Search BIK on twitter for some news on that.
Yeah, I'm thinking that there will be more and more hype around PSTH as it closes the year, as everyone gets anxious for Bill's announcement. 

Do you know if Robinhood supports warrants? I went with options also because I didn't even know if RH would give me warrants.

Again, sold when it dropped after earnings, as it was ONLY an earnings play. Any idiot could check the charts and see they were going to tank during early trading. 

I still think the company is trash. If you made profit going long, good for you. I made profit shorting. Who gives a fuck.
Ah. Cool for those who got in on the ground floor.

XPEV market cap is already on par with Ford though.

With that in mind, I definitely already don't have enough confidence in the company to put my money on it.
‘Preciate that, bro. It was quite a saga full of heartache and pain but I prevailed in the end. My retarded ass bought back in (way smaller and actually lower than I sold her) later in the day. I love the pain.

I'm so confused at why you don't cash out. At best you're going to start experiencing theta decay soon, at worst this drops. You have $1.5m right now - why is that a bad time to take profits?

I've made wayy too much money off of AAL when travel climbs with the market. The premiums are cheap and its always the most oversold before major travel moves in the market.

Ppl mostly post or talk about AAL gains on this sub compared to other airliners in spite of how much hate it gets in the fundamentals.

When I sell these leaps for a loss I’m sure it’ll become relevant again lmao
Liquidity is pretty bad on SPXS options, and being leveraged sends up the IV, which minimizes gains.

I've had both in my portfolio at the same time, and SPY puts always print more bigly.

That said, if you're doing it specifically because the underlying is cheaper and that's part of your strategy, then fair enough.
Enjoy your new car/house/boat if that happens. It's possible given the new excitement in the ticker
Man, I am so jealous of you guys. I Had a huge load of February 20c when it was trading at $18 and I sold after earnings at $27. Was only going to sell half but went for it all. Made good gains, but still salty. Was not expecting this type run. Congrats.
Same buy sold a call 12/18 20c ...hoping for a dive to sell puts although IV should go up next week with the meeting

If price moves up you can close out your original at a loss and roll up while making largely passive income that reduces your overall cost basis.  If you plan to be holding the stock anyway it's just a little side-hustle

From my understanding (and I’m retarded) historically any company that gets put into S&P shoots up in price but when it’s officially in it usually just goes back to its original price. So I’d watch out for the spike, which looks like it’s getting there now, and sell at the top obviously.

Jesus. Why are people pumping SOLO? It’s about one step below NKLA. 

Pumping and dumping an EV stock has the potential to fuck us with NIO and TSLA options.
And then take out a third mortgage you degenerate

“We slowed the spread”
I'm getting in on CIIC and BIK before the mergers. Both are commercial EVs that already have contracts with big companies like UPS and Amazon respectively. I could imagine a scenario where they become the go-to commercial EV producers. Everyday EVs will be huge but the market is going to be flooded with new makers and current auto companies pivoting.
Only time ever buying puts was on SOLO this week, congrats you fucks

I disagree, but I want to know why you think that. I keep SPXS calls as hedges because the underlying is cheap enough to where if the dump seems to be continuing I can exercise all of them  and continue to ride the fall without buying back into a new position. That strat worked out pretty well for me in Octobear, VXX puts then became my hedge. Why do you think spy puts are better than spxs calls?

This is the guy I will tell my grand children about.
I’m buying EV stocks that won’t surprise me with -50% losses one morning. Ones that actually make cars that people want to buy (like NIO and TSLA)
It just seems clunky to me. And probly on purpose cause i can see there is waay more info available. Im just rtarded tho, bitching into the ether. I will lose money wherever, i just wamt to learn the ins and outs of the platform. Ur right tho rh is so simplistic compared to td

I wonder if they have stock help line

I went shares and the warrants were a definite upside.  


However I'm looking at options profit calc now and those June 30 calls print better if we see psth above 30 by mid March.  So it really is a toss up.


I am definitely going to have both in the future.  Right now my current average cost of stocks is right around 23.
Nice play I think it happens tomorrow
I believe there is real potential with Momentus and Virgin Galactic. I’ve been trying to research into as much as I can and the company is pursing a space tug service that has little competition. SpaceX is lowering the cost of space travel and more demand is being created in space. This will create an opportunity for Momentus. There are lot of factors that can explain this rapid development in space technology.

The SPAC will provide them with more than 300 million and contracts with satellite companies keep coming in.

I try to cover this more at r/SpaceStockExchange and in this video: https://youtu.be/TraXbhS-GOs
Only for the smooth brains
I doubt EVs will drop any time soon. It wont be until people realize theyre not special, which will take many years.

It had good PR and decent earnings. Had low market cap before it tripled this week and has a bunch of pre-orders (though the pre-orders are relatively low commitment). 

Basically, it’s a gamble and people are hoping it’ll actually be worth a billy once it starts shipping and are piling on.
If you were up 25% in a day (which is a lot) it probably means you're taking far too much risk. You could just as easily be down 25%

Try to come up with a good risk management plan, and learn to take profits
Short seller research will come in and annihilate SOLO mark these words.
So the highest amount you could lose right now is 600?

Just remember opportunities will always come and go. Take profit frequently and even if it runs up more after you cash out just don’t worry about it. Also be patient if you have far out expiration dates, a lot can change in just one week.

sorry i got a little carried away with the exercise talk, i only saw the $10 ones, the other strikes i guess anything could happen.

the question stands, what is he going to do with the proceeds one way or another
i haven't noticed anything different. did you accidentally set a custom view as your primary?
16k watching Biden on PBS youtube

244k were watching Jiuliani talk about the cases they are about to file on RSBN on youtube

But we are to believe Biden had 80 million votes.

Markets are going to skyrocket once these cases get heard in court. Hell if Nancy loses the Congress we will get stimulus and it will be targeted to people instead of kickbacks to states.

Get ready for another $1200 per person checks.

At these current prices, what EV stocks do y’all like long term. ???
Read discussions on reddit regarding EV stocks, and some people were wondering how tesla rise will affect smaller EV stocks like this one.
I looked up their products, FUV scooters seem promising and cheap to buy in, so I did.
I sold all my Tesla at $500 cause fucking fundamentals. Average purchase price was $269.
You heard it from Biden just now, the concern with vaccines is the logistics and getting them to the most vulnerable. This is where PLTR is going to strike and become a mainstream tech titan for the foreseeable future. Get in now, you will never see a sub 20 dollar Palantir stock ever again past this week.

False. Homes in my area still have all cash offers by midnight of Day 1 on the market.
I made sure to add that part haha
So wait... I think you're saying trading options is less risky than "holding" NASDAQ?  Is that what you're saying?
Calling yourself a bull or bear is retarded. You can make money being bearable. ;)
I think they are okay. Especially if they dont do splits or do extra stock offerings so their values are actually legit.

Also people still go out man. Mcdonalds always has a line whenbi go by it. The place i work at has like 300 to 400 covers on Saturday and friday. During the week its between 100 and 250

Here is what people don’t understand. Yes, the market is overvalued but the amount of traders has seen a surge because people quarantining have literally nothing to do. So instead of buying shit with their money they’re throwing it into stocks. As long as quarantine persists, so will that influx of traders and cash. I am a bear so timing this is difficult but i believe we will not see a large crash until AFTER quarantine when these new traders decide to either forget about stocks and go back to work or cash out.
EVs are definitely making a bubble right now. I still think there is a lot more up to go before any crashing happens though.

NIO is definitely going up past what it’s at but it might go down at any given moment...like if one country bombs another...you never know. If you need the money, which you clearly do since you only bought 1 contract, then just take your wins and walk away from the table. The longer you stay the more likely you are to lose it.

The fact that the market hasn't dropped yet but in fact has made all-time highs has me thinking this is bigger than a market crash.  This could be the end of our financial system as we know it, there's no way back to sanity from here.   But it will most likely be a drawn out process.  Markets are useless right now, and the money made will probably be useless too.

Fact check on this post. 

List of the oldest publicly traded companies in the US:

https://www.pws.io/the-seven-oldest-companies-on-the-new-york-stock-exchange

Only two were publicly listed prior to 1871. 

Investments in 1871 are more than likely worthless today unless they were in $ED or $BK. Keep in mind the first index fund didn’t exist until 1967, so again, worthless.

Done!  I keep track of all the options I play and the return I get,  his last two that I bought and sold netted +172% and +154%.

Bro S&P Global fucked up bigtime with their Tesla announcement. Normally they announce an S&P500 inclusion and it’s the next week. So in a week 1 stock out 1 stock in. They gave Tesla 5 weeks and haven’t announced who’s getting dumped.

So instead of tomorrow being the last day of the pump and Monday being back to normal, we have until December 21st to pump the shit out of it.

Indexers will need to buy shares but they can’t buy until very close to the 21st or they risk not tracking the index. TLDR buy now sell before the 21st & stop bitching about being wrong. Take it to r/investing.
He is a pumper so not sure
I held my calls up 100% into tomorrow so I can’t have this shit going down

Hey op start her a Twitter and get her to live tweet every stock move
Exactly this. It’s crazy how many people deny it though
Same. Maybe a slight sell off before the weekend per usual, but we should be back on track next week.

Reserves are money. Yes, they can’t be lent directly, but they free cash to be lent. Cash is fungible. 

And the massive reduction we’ve seen in consumer debt, especially short term, may look deflationary to a Keynesian, but it means the average American is far more financially secure, and is looking to invest rather than paying 15-30% monthly on their credit cards. 

Your best point is about unemployment, but from an economic standpoint most of the lost jobs in retail and services don’t have much impact on the overall economy. They were mostly folks who got paid pennies to produce minor luxuries nobody needed. I feel for them, but that’s not even Main Street, let alone Wall Street. A lot of small business died, but that’s fairly common, and more have adapted and are coming back strong. 

Another shutdown might change things, but without one we’re headed for one heck of a Santa Clause rally. 

And we’re not shutting down again. No one really believes COVID is that dangerous except to sick old people, who don’t produce economically anyway. Even the media and politicians beating the panic drums the hardest take of their masks in private, or for riots, or to celebrate Biden, or for fundraisers... NO ONE actually believes the hype. Which is maybe dumb, but it means we’re not shutting down. The left is just hoping to keep people scared enough to justify a massive pork barrel “covid stimulus” in late January to bail out their favorite special interests.
I read somewhere a lot of patients don’t acknowledge it until their last day on earth. Sad

He said no national shutdown as in not every state shutting down at once. He also said we will probably need to strategically shutdown in places where it’s bad

FFS NKLA.

Yesterday traders were circulating a months old GM page about their deal in anticipation of GM talk today. Both GM and NKLA respond there is no news.

GM talk today. Literally no mention of NKLA. Dumps to open.

AH today Loop Capital starts rating of NKLA as a BUY with a target of fucking $35 a share.

Pump pump pump.

I don't understand how any analyst can rate this a buy. But my puts are in a shambles.

Honestly wouldn’t mind if we permanently shut down all of the flyover states
No way he makes it 4 years
Is the no shutdown most likely what caused spy to drill, or the Munchkin comments?
My ass probably since I bought 0dte puts
I got both baby
But stimulus hopes are dead 🤔🤔
They aren’t a start up or based out of SV lmaoooooooooo 0/2
Wow Biden can barely answer these questions
In a month? I have dec 18 calls
Spy doesn’t approve of no lockdown?
He stalls because he has no idea either
I tried some NKLA puts awhile ago and gave up.  That shit will crash some day, but I have no idea when.
Of course. Everyone realized the stock is worth over 60 right now and will be worth over 150 next year. Anyone not buying is a fucking retard
Fuck zynga. It prob go back up to 8 or 9 where it fucked me over tho
For real, why is SPY taking a sweaty shit right now?
According to RH spy will never again go under 356.42 , look to load at 356.43
What everyone should have expected
Got in at 19

TSLA 515c & 520c 11/27

Bought them at the low this morning, and, uhhhhhhh, didn't sell ;|
Do they have a ROKU app yet?

How a company makes a streaming platform and isn't compatible with 70% of streaming devices I'll never know....

I'm not going to buy an inferior streaming device or play it on my laptop and stream to my TV like some kind of nerd.
I’d agree, target the lockdowns at specific cities and areas
I say flat
They might even be correct about the market being overvalued. They probably are correct but it just doesn’t matter if you go bankrupt before it corrects.
It’s RUINED. Bro I have spxs call but chill
i had 3k in  after market yesterday and sold this morn at 17.5, thought getting back in with an avg of 16.9 wasnt bad, but damn was i wrong and my 500 shares hurting lol, could be worse...thinknig about getting more, just such a good company, just nervous because its all so new, and they dont even have products yet... but i just can shake the feeling that this shit will perform like nio and them
Apple to 135 by end of month please
Not sure.

CRSR is rocketing in the after market!
lol true
Need to get a bit lucky on WDAY. Short calls at 250 with 1 day left. Even with it being up AH, if it ends like here tomorrow, I'll still be good.
No national shutdown he’s just going to establish criteria for states to follow and let them shut themselves down as needed

Anyone thinking massive lockdowns aren’t coming is just not paying attention to the case and death numbers
Of course BABA moons the day before payday smh. Under $260 is an ideal entry point
Whats the next NNDM? Best play ever
Anyone who doubts NIO is a fucking retard. 10 whole minutes of research could tell you why they are going to hit 200 next year or more
Will the next big pump be when trump concedes?
Media was making it sound like one *might* be coming.
Probably blew up his account and gone
No National shutdown? Thanks joe. Gonna do wonders for my stay at home ‘folio

100%. Funny to see every core company be flat or mildly selling today. Also all these EV’s have monthly options. Wonder what will happen when brokers don’t need to hold the shares past tomorrow to protect against the option lol.
What’s Tesla doing tomorrow?
I think I stole the PSXP 6/18 $35 calls today at .90. Bought some previously at 1.1.  The spread was wide so took a shot and got filled. 

Going to be great for long haul I think
Hmm logic would say the absolute mountain of puts I have been buying would print,  but we all know how this market works with logic
FUV. Up 69% today with room to run
Up
That was me
What if MM artificially kept the market high today to buy back as many puts as they could in anticipation of a massive drop tomorrow?
Some thoughts 

1. Credit will have trouble expanding if debt is being refinanced. The act of refinancing destroys credit.

2. A large part of the upward movement in stocks is due to the death of the corporate debt market. The market turned March 23rd after the fed had stepped in to backstop corporate debt.
Anyone save the positions he took? I'm interested to know how it turned out.

When it starts dumping, I think it will be safe to buy puts across the board.
yeah, maybe tech calls and stay at home are the play

i'll think about my spy puts again tomorrow morning... i did well today

daily chart looks very bearish for SPY and things are worse now than they were the past 2 months -- we were up and down a few times now

the restart of stimulus talks makes me wonder
You're right its not just about the EV, with TSLA and NIO you're also investing in their AI and GPS systems. GM and Ford are only alive thanks to bailouts, I don't see them developing their own AI...one that works anyway.
I feel as if I may have had a stroke watching this?

No it’s pretty accurate bears eat out of the dumpster for a reason. I’d say a normal bear trader has about a 10% win rate and a pro is about 30 maybe 35% so yea 2 out of 10 is pretty fair

I don't like EV SPACs, but I like money
that's honestly fucked up
I’m deep in 290 calls for 2.19 but might’ve gone too strong into 11/20 calls. Need a short squeeze
Don’t know what any of this means but stocks only go up 🌈🐻

What happened to CptTonyStark
From his business website
Just bc of u spy 370 eod
It’s like $600 of lotto tickets. This is what happened Tuesday. Though we’d get a squeeze, it consolidated. Squeezed yesterday...consolidated today...we squeeze tomorrow I’m makin fuckin bank 😂 if not. I’m out $600. Whatever I made 3k on fcel the last 2 days.
SOLO long puts?
you could try a a bank that offers investment services, look up the ones in your country and see what they offer.
Thx bby!
I’m always worried on jumping in too late. It only started pumping today but I’m always a bit worried with these ones...
So SPY takes a massive dump right when he says no shutdown?

All of the stock market is priced in. It’s a regular thing to take profits after earnings.

Wtf going on with NAKD?
Good point maybe I'll start buying calls sooner or at least more shares

I’m not scared! Are you?
Gotta celebrate days like to day. Appreciate that dude that was posting constant Ayro memes to pump it. 

Seems like a shady person, but they weren’t wrong yet.
NIO hype
So some time tonight we should get a decision?
no it isnt, its also the lowest fakest volume ive ever seen. glad i was looking at order charts before close to see all the institutional orders at 17... thousands of shares traded for in last minute, the volume weve had after hrs equates to 1/5 of the volume there was in the last minute with orders at 17... call me retarded, cuz i am, but i think this shit opens green!
Stock market isn’t the economy. 

But the stock market is reacting to his policy agenda.

In hindsight...it was all a dream.
long term calls.. PLTR 20, or Tesla 550 (might be bumpy but it'll get there)..
Looks like they/it interpreted the F-10 amendment wrong and got fucked because those shares sold were immediately bought up and now it's up 1.5 percent AH.

Misread the question. Sounds like a gift. That's not taxable but any gift over $30k has to get reported. Those shares would get stepped up basis but only with an inheritance.

Bottom line you would still have to pay taxes on p/l based on shares unless they're an inheritance.

Bought on the dip up 67% and will continue to climb tomorrow. I believe a dip will happen in near future but not before we retest highs first. Similar to last Thursday when we dipped hard and all the bears celebrated only to be back over $360 to days later.

Are you the youtube steve van metre? Love your shows but sometimes I think you are plain wrong. 

But on this analysis you are right. The banks are in a tight position, damned if you do and damned if you don't. If they make money next year selling those bonds, the public gonna hate them, if they lose money and get bailed out, the public gonna hate them. So they said hey if you gonna be hated either way best to make money out of it.

Why do I believe your analysis - banks assets have been increasing every month, credit is tightening, mortgages lending is down, forbearances, defaults, and a whole host of other stuff, and their assets go up?

Listen to CNBC - buy banks stocks in the long run

Stock go up and the company just fucks shareholders printing shares like the treasury. Revenue growth is not promising at all and they have considerable debt. Oh and looks like they had to report massive goodwill impairment in 2019. And they are just slashing all marketing and development investments this year to try to convince poor investors that the company is improving but it is actually really scary close to going under. Yes if they get bought you will probably make a lot of money but you should know that a buyout is the only way this company will ever turn around and I don’t see any chance of Lyft touching a company that is reporting goodwill impairment like that. Good luck!

TLDR: I’m trying to save u from making the same mistake as me. Finances do not look promising and a buyout is the ONLY way they are going to rebound. It’s a pure gamble.
Hope you’re taking profits often.

VLDR you could argue is promising.  The problem may not be the company itself, but the complicated structure of the SPAC.  Look at what happened with GRAF and VLDR.  VLDR tanked for weeks right after going public, because PIPE investors absolutely unloaded on the market right after the merger.  There wasn't a lockout period for shareholders to unload.  GRAF got $150M in PIPE.  

A quick google shows CIIC has a whopping $400M in PIPE investors from big names.  It's difficult to tell how many shares that translates into and when PIPE investors will be allowed to unload, but don't be surprised at all if PIPE investors eventually unload.  A price drop could happen dramatically, or the SP of the company after merging could go down and get pinned for weeks/months as PIPE investors unload slowly.  Holders will get frustrated.  Don't bag hold here. If you make profits, get out before the merger happens the company goes public.  You can always pick shares back up once it looks like insiders are done unloading.  Even Draft Kings got bit recently after the lockout period ended.
And selling into the weekend begins now

Actually, you went full retard. I was right the first time. The Union Pacific stock in 1871 is not the same as the one today. 

Union Pacific went bankrupt in 1893. Those shares from 1871 no longer exist! 

Companies can still exist after bankruptcy, but under new ownership which leaves prior shareholders nothing.

Past two weeks have been so rough on me, that when I see after hours action that goes in my favor I automatically think "When's the switcheroo that screws me going to happen?"
Good to know. I’ll watch closer once we start approaching 20!
Lost $214
Sounds like B2B announcement in December
Oh
Rip! Lol. Doesnt look good
Tomorrow
yeah only made 50% from my NIO spreads, but very happy to close them. Couldn't really ask for a much better result honestly, from -60% last night to +50% today. Would be awesome if NIO keeps going for my leap
What is there to drive demand?  I will be buying one but there isn’t anything that is out that would cause me to pay over sticker price for it.  No have to have it software makes it much less compelling to early adopt.

If you don’t understand why they’re going up

Then you shouldn’t trade options

Not trying to talk down on you or others 

But if your still calling things a “bubble” like we’re in the 2000’s then you don’t fully understand the market change & need to take a step back and study up a bit
Ah yes, the plot thickens. OP's mom photoshopped gains to flex on his son.
Fast food is dead I’d like to say but dumbnuts sheeple still haven’t learned to cook for themselves in good ol ‘Mercia, so I see lines of cars blocking my commute waiting to get their cv disease on a platter.  Oh and the trend is away from meat now, even UNilever wants in in the action.

My average cost started at 1.11. I spent the day dropping it.  I might have caused the run where it almost passed Nio.
I'm seeing SOLO get pumped everywhere. Might be not terrible to ride this pump for another day or two (bought a weekly call just because)

Any reason?

I didn‘t go through all the details yet if there are any, but afaik there‘s only a annual fee of 1.5%(/0.99% if over 10k) of your portfolio but a huge 15% on all your earnings. But other brokers like plus500 for example don‘t have every stock. Wanted to buy csrs but there‘s none on the platform. And i could also go with swissquote but they ask 9$ for any investment under 500 and 15$ on US stocks. But no other percentages so that‘s a plus. But the swissquote demo didn‘t work for me and i honestly want to try it first before i do real stuff. (Although i already made 200$ in a few hours today off of 1000$ in a demo. The demo also had 10$ fees on every us trade. so i won‘t be too fucked in the real world if i don‘t go stupid right at the beginning)

As long as i get some pltr and nio in the next few weeks at a considerable broker I‘m happy. Wan‘t to start trading with 1000$ and work my way up.
I'm not even a lotr fan but I need some lotr Palantir memes.
Lmao
Aight I’m not WSB god but that’s pretty solid. Go back to r/tinder cause you can’t get hoes even tho you think 1k is trash
Not a joke:

> Nikola stock rose 15 percent on Wednesday after confused investors apparently mistook a month-old GM website for a brand-new announcement about the companies' pending agreement. The stock is up another 7 percent as I write this on Thursday morning.

I agree with you here 100% I own shares of SBE and was confused why OP is calling them out. SBE / ChargePoint is a gold mine right now.

so fellas in CIIC, was this truly a pump and dump? i refuse to believe that! we arent even below after hrs yesterday... and the volume was only 31 million? avg volume 300k? is it because its such a new listing? i see heller volume on all other ev, whats good with this one? spac investing limited?
There’s been some pretty good dips right at open the past 2 days before liftoff. I would buy if it happens again tomorrow.
Jokes on you. My dyslexic ass has been buying this since the CEO tweeted about the price being too high

Would you recommend a Leap on GM? I have a feeling relations with china might go sour and more investors will flock to american companies. Also does Japan have a full on EV company?
SO GLAD I BOUGHT THE AMD DIP YST. TESLA NEEDS TO GET TO $550 UMMM TMRW. THANKS ELON
Wall Street has been pushing EV for over a decade. Buffett bought BYD in 2008. Tesla was started in 2003. It took 10+ years for general public to pick up on that turned. Wall Street started to push 5G 4 years ago, so I guess in next 4-6 years, 5G will be huge.

RIDE is solid, they bought an old plant from GM and everything, even got some of those yellow robot arm thingys that all the large market cap boys have. Even SBE is solid. Now NKLA is probably trash until GM gets serious about them

I'll stick to shares. Cfd / options feel like betting on sports. You win or lose the bet
You seem like you’re young and new. That’s a great day. You obviously have some weird expectations of the market. 6% day is huge anyway you slice it.
It’s neither - it’s a small cap play with upside. I bought in probably same time as you and can’t say there is safe money on this. 

Even with this huge jump it has a tiny market cap and tiny float. People like us seem to be buying on spec. Probably a bunch of money to made short term as long as you aren’t stuck holding when the music stops. 

I’m spending my night reading up on the potential of dilution coming up so I wouldn’t play calls on this short term unless you independently verify that there isn’t some massive offering coming in the next week.

Also - fuck me for being rude. Congrats on the gains pal!! Hope you were as pumped as me watching it soar today. I’m just stressing on what to do next.

Regretting that move to PTON yet?
Gamestop better open at 16.37 if half the rumors ive heard are true. I mean 2 of them are hand in hand. There's a buyout that ceo George is considering, and rc is doing a hostile takeover. But what if rc is buying out George's positions so he can take over as the new ceo?
They rolled a truck down a hill.

 What an absolute joke

Yeah this market is wild, but this company gives Theranos vibes so who knows

What expiration date
on those two stocks, yes. They both absolutely TANKED (PTON by 20%) when the Pfizer vaccine news broke, now imagine people realize we are still dealing with this thing into next summer - they'll definitely creep back up

They’re pharmaceutical producers and offers clinical services. They also use digital tools on their patients. It’s a very good. Buy even right now when they’re at a high. They’re gonna moon tomorrow. I held my calls that have already been filled
Thanks. EV has been doing well so hopefully palantire can do to
Man if I wasn't such a paper hands bitch about risk tolerance I could be up way more than 36% this week...
calls
Nice melt up towards end of day.
What event does NIO have tonight?
Darn
Nice. lovely way to end my day. positive vibes
Im sorry bro 😂
im holding SPY calls so im part of it.  but which news do you focus on to support this?
Ayro has 50% jump. You trust that shit?
How are you fucked all you had to do was buy shares and hold, could still do it now and be a huge winner in a few months
That sucks
Stimulus discussions soon! Haven’t heard that one before.
Pltr 50$ EOY then after employee sell off 30$ then goes to 50$ again
So you are the one I’ve been supporting
That’s because it’s stuck below it’s ipo price when none of this shit was happening and has failed to capitalize on the perfect environment for its product
Just ease into it. Buy some here and there. DCA
Yeah and I've used the premium to buy more shares. It's easy to get fucked with how fast this goes up though, I sold a 19.5 11/20 that I'm hoping theta can take another bite out of tomorrow morning
same here.  prob gonna roll to next week 20's if they go ITM
If your objective is to get down to $0, then yeah that loooks about right
Cry to your wife's boyfriend I'm sure he'll cheer you up.
I wouldn’t.
Sup scumbags!
I think it bleeds up to 19 open and then rockets to 22/23
No, you’re right it’s not dumping...I’m just always impressed things react so much to info we already have like it’s new.

Got to have some fun.

thanks nvda very cool!
Now this is one retard I could call king
no sell puts, only goes up
They opened a physical location in Portland awhile back. I thought it would be like, a lot or a storefront or something. No, they leased a KIOSK outside of a Nordstrom in a mall.
Niu.
You roll it up and out. You buy the 3 contracts at a loss and sell 3 contracts further up (say $25) and out (say 3 weeks from now). The idea is that eventually it will go down for you to profit from the covered call without losing your shares.
go up
I diddddddn't. I went all in with xpeng today. When dip comes, I'll get some SBE
No
Nope
It opened at 18.50 and closed 18.90 or whatever.  .40 cents!! Wow!
No wtf
I thought about it then opened their website and saw their ridiculous car. I just can’t get myself to jump in...

Just bought 100 shares of palantier. What does it do?
When I first started investing I was up a shit load on aphria (pre legalization) I was up about 30k. Decided to set a "stop loss" close to my buy in. 930 am hits and my phone bleeps. Order confirmed sell apha 4k shares at 8.50. I made 8k but left like 30 on the table because some algo was set to scoop up ridiculous fuck ups like mine

Edit: Instead of stop loss I just set a sell order way under the current. Price
Crash of 2008 probs made him very paranoid some crazy clips if you YOUTUBE them

I think most people are aware that NIO will hit 60$, it's just a matter of when. I'm sure a lot of tards, including myself, got fucked today cause we bet that it would moon after earnings. Give it a couple months or years or whatever and it'll hit 60$. Stocks only go up friend

I have been long and posting DD's about palantir since day one.

I think long term stock positions or leaps are still a great idea.

Short term calls at this point are a bad idea.
any Palantir shareholders selling covered calls?
🙋🏼‍♂️
Tesla is up 2.6%

That's a lot. Maybe don't be retarded and buy 520C exp 11/20 at the literal top
You know whoever is downvoting is gonna lose a lot tomorrow
This is a moon for sure. A 10x from here sir still incredibly early
Yea I was thinking the exact same lmfao. I got a shit ton of 1/2021. I think I’ll probably sell in December and then wait for the inevitable dip that will happen in February when Soros and other can sell the rest of their shares.
Sorry man.
You’re obviously right - but, counter point: I’m a greedy hog who wants to be turned into bacon bits.

Tesla 550 tomorrow?
It's going to hit 20 AH.
You smell like shit.
Ski resorts make their money in hotels, restaurants, property sales, a little bit in lessons. Lift tickets only generate enough to keep the lights on. 

If the resorts stay open BUT the restaurants have to do only takeout or shut down entirely then you will see a drop. However, vail has huge income streams though real estate which is fucking booming because of covid. No shutdown is gonna stop rich people from fleeing to the hills and buying those million dollar properties.

Also, the epic pass is just a way for the resort to generate pre season cash. They need to visitors to buy the $16 hamburgers and put little Johnny in a $800 ski lesson.

POS: straddle this stock
69.420
Who went in on CIIC? raise your hands

It would be autistic not to buy in.

Come on Joey, say shut down!
no. up 6% today. they are moving consistently up.

Apparently it goes down on Fridays, but who knows, since I bought puts, it'll most likely go up!!!😂
Dude I know obese boomers crying about their January cruises getting cancelled.  People are absolutely going to go nuts next year and live (ie, spend) like they won the Call of Duty Mountain Dew sweepstakes.

Here’s another one GIK that’s will go parabolic like C**C.
CIIC getting pumped and dumped
make sure you read all the fine print, there can be hidden fees that apply.
Downvote goblin is back, I guess somebody made a retarded play
Its what I heard about Nio but for Xpeng its on their linked in profile.
Fooking know it
I had always wondered who buys those at NAV puts on SPACs that people sell for free money. I guess they do have a market after all :)
Lol love that “manipulation” is always to blame 😂😂
Man you better believe I’m loading up 12/18 puts on all these EV tickers with monthly options. Monthly OPEX tomorrow can’t wait for that Monday dump (I’m prepared for downvotes)
Me too, started on Monday.  PLTR gang rise up
More cases means for shut downs means bigger stimulus. 

SPY 500
It’s not gonn happen I’m probs wiped out tomorrow 
But if it does my account is saved not getting my hood up tho
Both hence why I'm here with you fellow wsb member😊
If it makes you feel better, I sold 1000 this morning around open and also had sold covered call on a lot more last week at 7.50c.
[deleted]
**😎**👍
These metrics don’t work. You are using value metrics on index’s that are overweight growth. Of course you are going to find correlations but that doesn’t mean causation. At any point these companies could drop all R&D and you’d have the lowest PE’s ever you’d say that it’s bullish but if growth isn’t being found it means we are big fucked.
😭 best day since Aug, +17%. FUV gonna hit $16 & FSR only gonna go up

Down about $700k from the peak and still holding. What are you going to do with the Jan 15 proceeds (~$700K) since you don't seem to have the cash to exercise?
Zoom out.


This has been a great bear week, and my wallet is full of CASH bro, not denial.
What’s your exit point? Thinking about placing GTC limit sells at $110 but not sure if it’s too greedy or not greedy enough.
if spy could just hit like, idk, 350? i'd nut
I don’t know how many retards have tried to predict a crash. But I’m confident they were wrong more than 95% of the time. So for that reason I bought more Tesla stock
You got this
Well guys after 3 months of building back my funds I just blew it all up again on Tesla . Never investing in Tesla ever again , most manipulated stock I’ve ever traded
Ayee I feel that switchback, gave my small account a decent boost this morning with their chargepoint merger coming up
No
If only pltr wouldn’t go back to 18.50 by morning
I sold at 18.98
Just buy SPY puts and MEME STOCK Calls - literally can’t go tits up because bubbles are symmetric.
Economy is completely fubar while the stock market has a massive erection high as the Burj Khalifa. It’s like a blown up ATM at this point grab as much cash before the cops (🌈🐻) come.

Breakeven is $3.4 and WTRH is currently trading at 3.45 (has boomed this week - I purchased last week)
I think it still falls if you can hold. It was getting a run up with all the EVs but it comes back down as it has no business model or product.
YOLO on SOLO
what the duck happened to CIIC
Yep, the dd was solid but the play was sell at open today.  


Don't see 20 by eom

Ok, real question, I bought 500 shares of BLNK a few days ago at 10 bucks a share. I sold 3 calls against it @ 15. They’re now ITM and will probably be exercised.

Do I: buy back the 3 contracts at a loss and ride 500 shares into the sunset? Or sell 300 shares for ~50% profit in a week and ride 200 shares instead?

My 5.5 12/18 calls are feeling real nice right now
Where do you see Tesla tomorrow?
I’m holding XPEV stock and I hope I never have to let it go
Covid only affects poor people. Poor people don’t ski. There are lots of rich people who have more money than ever because they canceled their summer vacations itching to get out. Even if we lockdown for December and maybe January, there’s probably a vaccine around the corner and people are going to go skiing for the second half of the season and next year, and the year after that, etc. it’s a temporary issue that won’t sink these businesses.

I bought poots, may the best autist win!
DH?
I would sell because it’s 500% and omg I’ll take that any day but common sense tells me to hold becuase EV gravy train shows no signs of slowing down.
Thank God I'm only at 4 figures!

No shut up, it’s going to 540 tomorrow

Today was just a breather

We got support at 493 and 487, if it dips in the morning grab some for next week or do a odte
Dropped 6%...
Damn some stocks have run up way too high, I see a lot of corrections coming
All memes aside, CRSR is legit undervalued. 5-8bn mcap should be reachable.
The spreads/volume were pretty sus so I mainly bought a bunch of shares, but that should be some tasty gains for ya.
Better yet buy back into your old position at a higher price
Allahualbarh mashallah inshallah Thursday

I know! That was my biggest fear, the run up pre-earnings to $17 and the expected tank back down to $14. Not this time!
How much steam does TSLA have left?
Realistically speaking, even though I'm long in PLTR, I have been expecting red days for the past 2 of 5 days... Tomorrow may unfortunately be red tbh
I'm halfway tempted to sell some of my calls early to get the capital to buy 10k worth of either $35c 1/2022 or 1/2023. I used up my instant deposit on RH and can't get more until next week

Just learned about RIOT yesterday even though I've been pro coin since 2012. Checked out their website, looks like they are DRASTICALLY increasing their mining fleet in January, to be fully implemented by April. More efficient mining + rising price per coin = holy fucking shit the tendies next year are going to be unbelievable. People can hate on the coin cause they don't understand it, but there's a finite supply and always gaining more mainstream adoption. If it ever gets to a point of being actual currency it's going to need an absurdly higher value than where it is right now.

Is CIIC gonna hit 20 tomorrow?
ROST just hit me with that stimulus check, let's get COVID solved overnight and have a full green day tomorrow 🤘
Lot of resistance on TSLA today. My guess is it dips tomorrow, and if it doesn’t, only goes up like another 2-3%
Wtf happened to NKLA? Why are people buying this?
Up 66.11% Today, bringing my All-time down to -68.58% Right now. It's not much, but its honest work thanks to CRSR and PLTR.

How did you not see that was where it was stopping, it was so clear

Salt bear starts at 4pm, here come the downvotes
Hard for to make a judgement call without the context of your whole portfolio and how aggressively you prefer to trade.

The easiest rule I’ve learned to follow is, if your gains are satisfying enough to screenshot, sell.

My mistake would have been selling too early, though. I probably would’ve sold at like 200% profit
The one gives stupid advice might actually be one who sells them to OP
CRSR will never stop going up. CRSR/PTON 401k guy fucked up.

This is literally the best time to buy CIIC, merger with Arrival expected to close Q1 of 2021, and production of orders starts Q4 of 2021.
Plus they already have 1.2 billion in orders lined up including from UPS

It gets you greater exposure to the stock at a fraction of the cost. Hopefully he bought it with a nice and high delta so his exposure stays relevant. The Theta decay on those long term holds starts real slow.

Well, think about how everyone was into tech not that long ago. Now you barely see aapl and co posts because everyone got a new toy to play with. Tech is boring, EV is in season. Will it eventually play out and cool down? Sure. But for that to happen we need new sector and there isn’t one.

What I meant happened today
I was promised tendies from CIIC. I demand an explanation.
Their data analysis is so advanced that they already had billions of data points on your behavior. They don't need to scan your comments. They can predict what you're going to say before you say it.
and so the AM pump begins
Depression
not true, if they are 20's ur chilling hard lol just get the shares called, max it goes to is 22 if they truly decide to wild the fuck out
Agreed.  I don’t the last time I transferred money out

Holy fuck
Market crash confirmed
Bought some calls and shares
Since you didn’t end your last sentence with a period I’ll assume the story you’re feeling isn’t over and you have more fantasy to tell us. By all means continue.

Opinions are changing on how we can best respond to covid though. Activists/Politicians are beginning to accept that being outside is extremely safe relative to being shut inside. I think there may be more restrictions on bars/retail/restaurants, but less on outdoor activities going forward.

Would not be surprised to see it at 25 by the end of next week. The merger news was announced yesterday so it still has pump potential.
oh, I agree that no one cares, esp the south,  when I was down there almost no one was wearing a mask

and that's exactly the problem, people don't care, calls on the infection rate would be the best play right now

Also, sorry tsla, but had to buy puts EOD. Think we are gonna go back down to 480 range tomorrow
We were heading right towards a deep red day until they threw a fake stimmy pump into the mix.

I'd bet the stimmy euphoria will be forgotten tomorrow.
#🤢🤮
He might have been cursing his own mother.
Knew it was coming.

He’s.Still.Fucking.In
F
gme hitting 14$ tmrw.
my post is still up but unfortunately i had to adjust it to a bear flag. Tomorrow we will see a dump. SPY 350p 12/18
SPY 350p expiring tomorrow. Nice little lotto ticket.
Why is this downvoted
? It barely moved today
Never speak that cursed name again
Might be wishful thinking, but AMD looks like it wants to breakout to 90. Semis look good overall.
I'd say that's a fair assessment. A little birdie who does this stuff for a living told me that's the main stock he's buying up on the dips, that's what got me into it. It's paid off so far
25 EoY easily, not gonna lie
Too many autists got crazy on Nio. Inverse WSB will bring tendies🍗
i bow to you sensei.
[deleted]
Ehh a lot of ppl don’t really care anymore tbh. Vaccines otw for the vulnerable.  They’ve been saying from the beginning that this fall would be the worst so I think the markets have been somewhat anticipating the COVID cases.
Yikes what’s your exp ?
Dude why did you post this on wsb, should’ve posted on a more serious sub
Fuck EV Cars, it’s gonna take a while till they get a significant amount of the market share, it’s just pure fucking speculation at this point, now shut the fuck UP and ride the EV Bubble up and down.
Fuck you let me believe in it
Why did XEL tank so much these past days?
First ones free
1% isn’t so un likely
We are down .045 atm
Pretty good day overall, most stonks went up by 2% approx, even Big tech is up slightly
LMAO MAKING MONEY OVER HERE
Will do. I looked up IV and rhe standard deviations bit im a little confused on. I know it shows a standard deviation of where the price can go in between, im having trouble understanding what that means for me and my buying decision
I switch around from bullish and bearish about 100 times from 3:58-4pm every day
Most likely in the morning, then just like today it’ll rise in the afternoon. PLTR likes to stroke real slow
Who fucking cares
This right here is the quad witching in reverse. Fuck you. Buy AMD CALLS bitch!
ur mom dips 7%

🚀🚀🚀
oh no. look at the 4 hour chart what happened last time it mooned this hard
The retards who bought NKLA at 60 and sold at 20 are the reason Elon is issuing caution. Chargepoint actually has product in the world and shouldn’t be roped into this same conversation. After the merger, Chargepoint will break $50.
Like i said, you think the bubble is about to pop, buy puts. Otherwise, shut the fuck up.
I don’t know why I only bought 2 shares @5.98. Feels bad man
Fuel cell crashing tmrw
Tesla running again tomorrow buy the dip easy as fuck
Yea I gambled on that last time and did pretty well. Ended up going with FL this time around.
Great, which country?
I only got 10k in, this guy can buy a lambo and I'll buy a Porsche.
Or like marijuana stocks.
I don't hate bears. Without them, i'd have no loss porn to jack off to.
Hope you got in before 4
Not above $18 apparently
I just started officially trading 3 days ago after lurking for years and PLTR is making me feel invincible already let's goooooooooooooooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So this is the WSB etf?
Fuv was easy money all day
wake up to +10%
[deleted]
I know NIO is gonna be part of the Guangzhou Auto Show tonight, but anyone know if XPEV or LI will also be part of it?
Could be pump vtrs tomorrow thanks
Please tell me you didn’t just UwU in this fucking thread
Yup, I’m not understanding where people get the idea that tech is somehow not going to be needed when COVID is gone
Need a cigarette just for reading this
Ok. Rumor why gme is up is because rc has gone over 10% and is doing a hostile takeover and he's going to be acting ceo tomorrow.  Some big shorts unwound causing the pops today. Either a 8 and 13k drop today and proves the rumors or its a fuckin garbage heap myth.
No idea, I got 362 calls, so one of us is making money.
NO REASON?!?!!??? God damn some of you guys here are clueless
[deleted]
I like that, I just started screwing around with some covered calls on FCEL and made a couple bucks on some SPY calls. How far out do you guys sell calls for? The nearest date?
I shouldn’t have sold so many covered calls for PLTR tomorrow. I’m going to miss all the upside :(
11/20 Blink 182c
Diamond handed Tesla $520c for tomorrow.
Can confirm the wait lists for getting on the Vail resort mtns are ridiculous, many people got free pass carryover from last year, capacity is garbage and Denver is already close to shutting down again
SOLO is the new NIO boys!
I went a little further out TSLA 12/4 510c 

Probably why it started its drilling to be honest
[deleted]
Let’s go $ROST pump your stupid little ass off
PLTR, it's like EV for data or something.
🤡🤡🤡
it went up

and if it crashed again I would go long... maybe

with mango gone it might not be a v-shape next time
HCAC.

Also, hold BABA.
Palantir 🤳🕺🏼
Think Gm would bet its life on EV if they couldnt sail it thru covid bull shit m8?
change that mentality lol
LETS MAKE THE EV BUBBLE EVEN BIGGER BOYS
[deleted]
Yeah it's uh...pretty obvious. This is not a place about long term investing however.
PLTR.. how high will you go
MCK. They have a monopolistic contract with government to distribute any COVID vaccine. Do your own DD of course.
EV bubble > dot com bubble
Are my kandi 12p 11/20 gonna print 😂
Boring ass day
You might be in luck, I smell a crash incoming
Beg to differ. My feb $5 call was up 130% today
Hold, don't paper hands, I've paper hands twice and nearly regretted for life because it either did not return back and I have to buy in higher, and was insanely lucky it return back to my initial selling price.
Just bought one way otm SPY put just to stay in shape.
Thanks for the read on qqq this AM. How do I not miss it in the future?
Tsla dips 7 % tomorrow

Well, I am the last guy that wrote a [discussion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/j3fhvs/the_dangers_of_counterfeit_vape_cartridges/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on how all EV stocks are overvalued. I don't when it'll burst, but I do know that come Dec 21st Nikola's IPO lockup ends (giving big investors the ability to get their money out of the scam), and also Tesla joins the S&P and index funds will buy it.
10 bagger
UBER is at all time highs.

Wait
PLTR
Or lost
Anyone know whats up with XEL?
[removed]
Are you joking? We are probably finishing above $360 tomorrow
I'm not a bear LMAO. I'm just explaining why a 13-F is not relevant for a systematic hedge fund like Rentech. Look up how the strategy works before you start sputtering nonsense.
It the one company that is guaranteed to make more money as soon as vaccines print, and they will print... until that day its a slow burn up to the moon. The days after the vaccine news really hits is the day it lands next to elon on mars.
If the Fed is hammering Congress to pass new stimulus, wouldn't the market simply maintain/rebound once stimulus talks resume? What's preventing renewed stimulus negotiations from completely fucking your position?
Yea it was over the last few days now its taking a rest. Yesterday was sell the news.
Aye
Kenny just tryna fuck. Respect
+55% on the day!!
EV is shaping up to be the dot com bubble of our generation. I’m just running with this and cashing out at the first sign of an blow off.
Announced they're running a pilot program in Orlando and everyone lost their shit
Prepare for dump AH 😔
That bubble will pop but maybe after you’ve been taken to the cleaners by Xi
Only if your portfolio has a majority of leap nio calls
went from -24% to a -2% day thanks spy
Fucking hell man.
thanks. I own TTD and many ppl are saying MGNI is a good bet as well but at a much lower price.
Its not burnt until you sell it 🤪
even if this doesnt blow up i still saved post because this is a really cool idea. i also like that you did % not $ because some people will be like "up 5k" but be down 100K all time
[deleted]
My only regret was not selling SBE when it broke $25 today. 

😥
Fuck off
Loaded up on puts right at close. Wish me luck 🤞🏻

Yikes.
Luckily dated mine for 12/31, hoping to weather this fake ass pump
CIIC BABY
I posted on here yesterday saying they were gonna rocket. I bought my calls. Now look they’ve rocketed and I’m up 500% and still holding because tomorrow will be the same way
Bought back my covered call at 3:58pm so I’m feeling good
Sold JD puts and bought PLTR FDs with that premium. 20c 1DTE let's go🚀
Get in on FUV it’s insane too
Anyone else wish they never discovered options? I’m up 10% today and I feel like a failure.
CSRS have my babies plz
YUGE
ayro please don't tank
Season passes have been refunded due to covid impacts for other places. If they get shut down, it's expected there would be some kind of refund.
Pretty much, yea! Lol
THE NEXT BIG THING! HOP ON!

I’m 14 had a really small account worth $800 and put $200 in a $TSLA 780 Strike 12/11 exp. and it double woke up with 1k sold oh yeah I also had a $PLTR call like 20% profit on so it’s not much but it’s honest gains

Wtf is going on with FUV?
[deleted]
I've made money of nio this week, but damn this shit looks unhealthy dont u think?
I heard about it yesterday when it was at $9 and was scared to get in at 11 today. I done fucked up. Now it’d be dumb to get in
Is mango talking?
Aight we in it together
I think the option flow data is saying it will die down soon but I don’t think it will be a hard crash.
wow WMT with the 2% day... naughty
This is retarded. And not in the good kind of way.
spare any change for a gay bear?
lol don't do it

This is the bubbliest bubble in a hot minute

I shorted nio yesterday and I am bleeding
Covid spiking worse than ever, flu season, cold weather, what could go wrong?
That just pump and dump. The money made there will come back to the legit EV stocks
of course HYLN doesnt pump... why do I even hold that POS rofl
Cocks out of your mouths boys, it was a good day
 **+19.35%**  day - Time for a nap!
2 guys and 1 cup
PLTR is like taking candy from a baby
TSLA 11/20 510 C. Let's see if this coin flip pans out.
So y’all loaded calls too right
Ouch son
So by averaging down you mean burning more money?
200x JETS 23c 6/18/21
Bro, there is only ONE Tesla. Nio is the closest next thing
See ya next week
I agree. It's like 2000 where anything even tech related jumped
Damn you made that much money bruh?
PLTR ending at 18.98 what a cock tease you little twink slut!

Not gonna look at ah action, but edge myself on that finish.
Oof
I made about $15 on my shares ✌

25 shares LMAO. Although being completely flat around the $550 price level is a huge fucking win for NVDA stock
the things that move the market are 'surprises'.  covid getting worse isn't a surprise.  the reactions will likely be minor; not like the 20-30% bed-shitting session we had in late Feb / March
Hopefully
Oh god

I just out 20k into boeing 230c expiring next friday
LMFAO.  Is she legit retarded? Pay them to stay home and develop depression and substance abuse problems!

Our governments best thinking and our tax dollars hard at work

53K for the calls at today's prices Hope you bought them a long time ago.
Put your money where your mouth is or shut the fuck up.

Let's hope
Im hoping the bubble last another few months at least. The canada cannabis bubble lasted a solid year.

It also seems line the dot com bubble but im too young to know much about that.
Up 42 overall heh
SOLO up 40%..  calls only up 150% haha
But it was worth the ride
For anyone who watched FSR tick by tick today. 💤
so we gonna see baba 300 eom or?
XPEV for the win !
Imagine buying Puts lmaooooo
Mitch be like "lol those retards really bought it"
I'm not even sure if I won or lost today,don't remember my starting balance and E-Trade gets funky when playing with options. 



I feel like a winner, thats all that matters
What happened to the market after March/April?
Don't you love seeing that?
o fuck, i joined ber gang EOD.
Most boring power hour ever

Airlines and banks
My option screen showed a load of activity on mylan. I have no idea what they do but bought 10 22.5c for $Like $15 each. Up 245%
DD on SBE: it fucks
Spy? I bet your good
SEC doesn't give a fuck about fincrimes unless its a minority or poor person committing them.

Go look up who went to jail over 2008 lol, accidentally the entire backing sector and it was some rando brown guy
did you see the sell wall at 19.00? it’s fucking massive
BABA 300
The morning V shaped recovery wasn't enough? There is plenty of money on the sideline to buy these dips.
Nio and xpeng are unveiling their gen 2 cars tomorrow. Could be why.
Should have stayed out after a decent morning, gave back some gains

Holding the $260 puts I sold yesterday that are up 65% 

Praying to fucking Jack Ma and Chinese Winnie the Pooh that this shit closes above $260 tomorrow.

Although it does feel greedy risking assignment for an extra $600
Praise be to Elon
It’s up 12%
Really hope you idiots that had massive gains in KNDI and FUV sold... there’s no fucking way those increases are justifiable
Tomorrow i will sell every stock i have if we‘re green
holding 354p expiring tomorrow how fuk am i
Pltr with the veiny green dildo to close. $25 EONW
11/27 545c was a trip today.
LMFAOO why pltr ended 18.99 wow
Up to $9.70 AH and back to $8.20 at open
That's how TSLA started. Literally by reverse-engineering golf carts. Look up history of TSLA. Elon did not start TSLA, btw.
It’s going to pump first, then may level off
Thought about picking up goodrx at close yesterday. Thought nah it should sink more.
I think they’re primed to get bought out by a company like Lyft
We go again tomorrow palantards
You and Icahn
What you holding?
Worst and best place to ask
Lmao EV bubble pop is gonna be fucking insane.
Just a penny short
18.98 MARKET MANIPULATION BRO

&#x200B;

still 6% tho
My bro and his fam are arriving to ski breck on the 21st
PLTR 20 tmmrw
I've never dug into TTD much just because the share price is so expensive, I want something with more potential upside. But from a quick read, they're similar. MGNI focuses on streaming entrainment which is obviously the route most consumers are going vs traditional cable. It's also getting added to more and more hedge fund portfolios which should tell you something
EBs bro, get on board
u/StevenVanMetre  Great post, seems pretty spot on.  I suspect after the election is when things will really start to head down.  


Do you understand that the banking system works on whats called "fractional reserve system"?  


When the FED injects those extra reserve assets, it allows the banks to create an 10x extra that amount of money they hold on their balance sheets. So if the FED injects 1million into a commercial banks reserve assets, it essentially allows the commercial bank to loan out, or use up to 10million in assets. That's how the FED indirectly prints money.
BLNK and FCEL calls holding overnight there's no stopping these ones yet!!
Whoever said to get call  options in FUV, I love you
PLTR stopping at 18.98 is the biggest edge I’ve ever had
Dildos down boys
DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING
seems like there's a strong correlation
Soon you won't have money. I hate TSLA but I have calls.
What language is the bot written in
They did.. I also am seeing the controversy now with the botox. I sold 3p and bought 2ps to cover my ass if it drops a ton for any reason
Imagine any fake headline pumping 1% but shit shutting down is only -0.01%. Bears are clowns.
cock tease
[deleted]
There are so many EV stocks now hard to keep up...
Pumps like these are a warning sign for bears to pull out and also why we will never win
6% up today... ill take it
Load up boys
1/21/22 and 1/20/23 mostly
GG
Please sq please 194 tomorrow.

Lmao PLTR, what a tease!

PLTR is such a troll, it would go to 19 at close.
Cfds are different wouldnt go near them tbh and some sites have a limited amount of options available but has nothing on us brokers

I'm 20% NIO, 20% PLTR, 50% AMD and 10% BA but honestly these memes are so good might just turn all the BA and AMD into PLTR by tomorrow EOD.
Yeah no one actually wants to drive around homosexual mini fridges like SOLO tho
I'm big on APHA, everyone seems to agree they're the best overall weed company. 200 shares and a few $6c 1/15/21. 

I also like sweetwater beer, especially the yellow can.
I shorted nio lmaoo
#GG
you need insider tips👀it cost 9k💲🤣🤣
Aye
I work as a beer salesman that serves grocery stores. I sell in white claw and truly. The hard seltzer market is very crowded right now. If you want to buy stock with hard seltzers, buy SAM. They own Truly. The Truly brand has been the only seltzer to take a bite out of white claws market share....dont believe me? Look at SAM stock this last year. I bought in just before it popped in early summer.
That’s hot, except Tim make it that girl with the huge knockers sitting in the background of Trumps townhall a few months ago
god speed in AH everyone.
You could have bought them yesterday for $1 and sold them today for $16. This app is free try it TitanFlow.io 
If you see the flow from yesterday there was a 30k trade at a $1 premium. It’s wild man
Wow, what a day
Almost there....
I 4x my portfolio this month. Everything just went up. Time to book profits and not push my luck.
PENCILS DOWN
I can't believe you guys let tsla close below $500

You haven’t learned yet that earnings always fall do to IV crush? NIO could’ve tripled earnings and posted a billion profit on the Same day Trump announces a new trade agreement with China and it still would’ve fucking fallen

GME seems to be cupping back to $15. Any thoughts?
My break even point is below (or currently almost at) the current trading price. That’s what I mean

Sold solo for a big loss on Monday. That’s all you need to know
Anyone know what to do with FUV? Stay clear or try and play it
this shit is g\*\*. but if you want some advice. play day trades tomorrow. we'll probably retest 358 another 3 or 4 times -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-
A lot of shit can happen in 3 years. A lot of good too... so yes it will either go up or down.
Probably for the best tbh
LMAO RETARD BULL

Edit: nvm I've seen your response lol. I'll look through those
some fuckwit brigade downvoting every single post
About QE:

After the bank puts their X dollars in the reserves they loan out 10X in liquid money using the X dollars as fractional reserves.

The FED says they are creating liquidity because that’s exactly what they are doing.

This is why borrowing money has become dirt cheap, because the fed is flooding the market with dollars, whether directly or not.
saw some dude post about it a million times before it blew up, but you know honestly no offense cause im proud and all but this just one of those stocks you were holding at the right time and just got incredible blessed on

The reason is because calls go up when a stocks price goes down.

Yo the market is scaring me. Everything is just going up. And we’re about to get into a nasty winter. I closed my positions for safety and took my profits.
Got me some of that
Just trust the flow man. If you can follow what institutional investors are doing it can help you be more confident about trades

VTRS is going big tomorrow. You’ve got 2 mins to get in
APHA is probably a buy here. It's weak today compared to peers and the market just freaked out about an updated/amended F-10 filing. It was just to update the share sell for the sweet water deal.
SPY 360 tomorrow, and TSLA 515+
tsla lurkers are kinda quiet no? maybe a chance to unload those 500+ c tomorrow...or will iv n theta have wiped them......?

the gall of them MM to do this tip toe dance at 498/499 just to drive home how they have total control and will fck over everyone with glee 

y all need to get your chance at running the show and tear this whole rigged boomer system apart and burn it, twice.
AMAT shares been cancelling out a portion of my losses for years now, Just broke 400% total return today.

Portfolio still red tho.
Or we could all just give you money.
Yeah

That’s the smallest casting couch I have ever seen.

Gonna go buy a tent rn
That’s not how this will play out. Greater than 50% of Americans will get the vaccine in the first half of 2021. As they do, case numbers will plummet and everything will open back up. Even those who choose not to get the vaccine will be protected due to herd immunity at that point. It’ll be business as usual by July. 

In your example, an obese boomer who gets the vaccine will see his risk of dying from covid drop from 3-4 percent down to far less than 1 percent thanks to the efficacy of the vaccine and herd immunity. The cruise lines and Vegas buffets will be packed.
How far back did you buy them? Because IV seems to rape me anymore
I am long 🤓

SOLO pumping, do I hold until tomorrow or sell now?
SOLO shit is so hot right now. Ride the wave brother.
Breakout? We talking about the company that went up 11% in the past few months? Just bought some calls but what’s your expected timeframe for more pop?
“Chinese electric car maker GAC NIO will unveil a new model at the Guangzhou Auto Show, which opens on November 20, with specific information unknown at this time.”

Get in the next 5 minutes! 🚀🚀
No time for DD at this point. But buy some GIK before close
That PLTR daily chart is so nice. Slow burn up
Best to be safe with weeklies, especially 1dte ones. Unless you're buying them 1dte or 0dte to leverage yourself cheaply with high risk
So we just ignoring jobless claims rising, got it
LTHM
They've thrown everything at the market this week: vaccine pumps, stimmy pumps.


Both pumps were pretty weak.

If you did a FD on FUV EOD yesterday, it'll yield 100X or 100 bagger atm on the 15 strike

I NEED A BUY BEFORE CLOSE HELP QUICK

LTHM?
Right!  It’s still pumping. I grabbed $9 options for tnrw. Idk if I should hold through the night or not
You’d be surprised how many accounts get wiped out on this sub with a 1 dollar gain
Me too babe. Me too ♥️
WDAY meme pump into close please
0dte tsla puts if you gots the balls
Dead ass ... long term though
This. The axis descriptions also looked a bit off-center. Not sure he's legit
Last minute Yolo FD?
Definitely not 80% US money
Hold
ayy what did i say my boy
Even the direct listing was shareholder friendly. I heard a lot of moaning about how many shares are outstanding etc. This management team is just making it easy down the road to do splits.

Long term investors will do considerably well
Maybe one stock is red today and I have 1k on it fucking dumb
I like kicking down the door and then improvising as it all goes to shit

Anyone else have any dd they want to post now before the market closes or do we have to wait until after hours again to make tendies on ev spac mergers?
Crash?! No. 20% pullback?! Yes! When idk, they have 1 more vaccine from AZ this year and potentially 2 FDA for moderna and pfz, till end of year! Then they have  2 more vaccines in jan/feb and stimi talks! Be careful with puts, open small hedge like uvxy/spxu calls for next year and do your thang! GL
I believe the P/E ratio is more than justified when you look at the plans tesla has to set itself up the be the big dog of the EV'S I.E giga factory's, software ect.. P/e is barely even applicable to tesla

I will be very surprised if it doesn't start going up leading up to the launch.

I mean, I wouldn't call SPY a meme, no matter how much it's shilled here
Expanded lithium miner positions today, picked up some SQM and LAC, added more LTHM yesterday.  ALB still a bit pricey on the option side.

Even though they have ran a bit in order for any of these EV companies to hit the valuation they are getting it’s going to take a ton of batteries which means a lot of lithium.
Reminder: MOON ETF exists

Edit: I can't even SPELL Einstein
Jesus. FUV up 100% in 5 days?
AMD is feeling spicy. BA is ready for a jump. MPC is ready for take off.
Likely because it’s currently a meme stock and no one knows about it yet (hasn’t become mainstream) and has some nice run up over the next month or so before it gets treated like a real stock rather than a hype day trade.

I’m long long-term on PLTR by the way. It’s got the-next-Microsoft feel about it.
Make it a spread to lock in some gains
Link?
KNDI MOONNGGG
I'm pretty deep in shares as well.  Not quite 20% but it is my biggest holding at the moment
yes
Seriously tho, RIOT might be the NIO from a month ago that PLTR was supposed to be now

Ok, you got the job. Now just give us a ticker and position and we can proceed to pump it to oblivion.
How about this, yes
Do you realize that its only the memes rising while everything else is getting slightly sold?

Any guess on when the GNOG close happens this month?

Nahh
Cringe.
all I want for Christmas is a big red dildo
all jokes aside, we're heading into potentially another lockdown, at the time where MTN makes most of their money. I hate to be a gay bear (i've legit only taken out 3 puts in my life, and one of those was really a call on a bearish fund because I was still stuck in the closet) but this is gonna be a move when their earnings end up being trash because no one can ski when it's corona.
$GM: *I think we understand EV, just throw out some lofty af goals and watch the stock pump*

For real, unsung hero.

Valuations do not matter. As long as companies post what the market considers "good" earnings, stocks will keep going up. Clearly the market is looking past COVID into 2021, as long as any company can keep showing that they are recovering and can survive until COVID ends and then continue growing afterward, their stock will go up. Many retailers, airlines, cruise lines etc fall into this category, which is why they are performing so well despite eating shit in the near term.
Just bailed out of spy puts at a loss so it's gonna dump overnight just FYI
I feel like since a lot of options are expiring tomorrow MMs are gonna make it red so people don’t profit. Lock in EV profits today?
PUMP IT!!! USA USA USA

I was thinking the same thing. An outdoor activity where you already are likely wearing something around your face and you can't be close to other people to do it anyhow. Why the fuck would this industry vanish when distancing doesn't really matter. People are still going to rent rooms have have their food ordered.

Aside from that, just the fact he put a big dumb arrow is enough to say pass on this one.
More like 6 days

Stop with the fucking “going to the moon” posts, you fucks keep jinxing it.

I’ve seen 3 “Dow to 30k” posts in the last week, and look at what’s happened.
He didn't sell it because he thought it was a bad investment. He sold because he morally didn't like the company. And besides, it's priced in anyway.
jesus christ EV's just pumping lol!! solo to 30s
Not this time calls will print bigly
I see
time for puts
sheer gamble, he made big money with nio, pltr and xpeng and i think his risk tolerance is too high
How are they so high now? Doesn't seem like covid is impacting them.
Quick yeet 10k on what?
Should I bet my life savings on AMD 90c for tomorrow?
Generally the autist on here after blowing up their accounts yoloing into weeklies or 0DTE, tend to work behind a Wendy's (usually near the dumpster due to privacy) over the weekend sucking cock or giving out handjobs. In order to load up their accounts to play next week. 

 Personally I take a corner restroom at the bus station due to my arthritis needing some heat, but I digress. 

OP was alluding that he would like to meet up behind a Wendy's with old girl up there to suck his cock. 

I was alluding to not seeing a cock bulge in the bikini bottoms, so OP wouldn't have a cock to suck to make his money to play the market next week.

But I don't judge, we all need a way to pay for our addictions. 

Savvy?
Done. Big stock purchase, cash out in a few years, retire on a yacht.
If I get rich I will buy stocktwats.com and redirect it to this sub
Tesla being manic
lmao
The main difference between the real guy and OP is the time frame. OP has options for a month out whereas the really guys thesis is over time. This could mean mistiming or even that the move is slow enough to kill the options.

Theta and iv
> As you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations. 


Lol no. You can’t just fucking say it keeps rejecting new highs when we just made one, and then say “ok but that was a one off”. It could very well test and break it again. What if it breaks 3660 on some other stimulus vaccine need? “Ok but its just another one off that was rejected, won’t happen again.” It’s overvalued but very likely your timing is way off.

the person "he bought the shares" from is only getting whatever he paid for the shares, no more no less. If he buys and then the value later drops, the money it dropped by afterwards is literally and not figuratively gone. That's lost in valuation because these are all just valuations. Someone sells for 10, and now it's worth 8, the seller isn't getting back the 2 dollars he lost.

&#x200B;

I don't know if you're just used to dealing with the retards on here or what and you just made an assumption based on what i was saying, but this shit literally becomes your socks somehow disappearing in the dryer. There is money dissipating that no one gets to see, simply based off of how this value is constructed.
Plus all the ppl that still bought season passes - so the resort has that cash and will see cost to run decrease because they are shut down

PLTR $20 eow
Is it okay to let vertical spreads expire on ToS? I know that’s a no-no on RH.
Considering he can make a lot of money from all those plays, let the man play
I don't understand what your problem is. I literally said i laughed first and processed it later. You compared two extremely different situations to say i shouldn't have been disgusted by it. Yoloing and losing money is funny because party involved is literally aware of the risk they put in. Workers are told that precautions are being taken to prevent the spread and workplace is made safe. And then managers go and put bets like this, it is distasteful. Headline makes it funny, sure. But that laughter is always going to be short lived. Lot of comedians do tragedy jokes with this same intention, to make us laugh and then think, Ricky gervais for example. 

And yeah i was wrong about calling managers millionaires. I read "execs" in my mind.

Everyone should buy 700 puts. I have a long position.

Just wait until Pfizer comes out saying their RNA vaccine could be stored as same as Moderna’s RNA vaccine. For fucks sake, they use same technology. RNAs are prone to degredation. Whether it’s Pfizer’s or Moderna’s it’s safest to store in extreme cold temperature.
KNDI wow

I hate PLTR haters
Only trade parts of the 9k for short-term gains. Put the rest in high interest savings ETF.

Hope you held on! I sold the call for 100% profit when it could have been 1300%... But no big deal. Have the shares for the long term.
Do you really expect it to grow 5-10% daily?
Here’s some honest advice. If you’re in NIO and you don’t have diamond hands just do yourself a favor and get the fuck out. That’s the only way you’re gunna make bank off it don’t try to day trade it. Just buy it and hold until you’re happy with 2X 3X 4X or however high you wanna go. Patience is the key, if you don’t have it go play a different game
Woth the almighty CCP legit fundamentals it will at least build 100000 cars in one month! This month!

Adding shares of PLTR is the consensus.

bruh I bought NIO Dec 60 calls when NIO dipped to $41 last week. NIO is now $48 but my calls are worth less than when i bought them

what the fuck is going on
RIP
HIBB or FL
Naw it will dip back under $19 at some point.  It’s making higher lows but it’s not parabolic.  Instead of dipped down to 18 it will dip to like $18.30 instead.  

I wouldn’t buy weeklies on it but I am pretty comfortable with my Dec and Jan calls
PLTR bout to run up AH
TSLA ZM NVDA DKNG lets get it
He’s worried
Crazy that you can literally build a 3 wheeled golf cart and that justifies a half billion market cap... Puts on FUV... at some point

Did news come out or something?
Hold, 21 tomorrow

Make PLTR 19 again!
You're right but I hate the bleeding, still considering throwing another 10k at it tho
This is investing, not something you should turn to to get your next fix. go do some drugs or something if your that bored, retard
How could you ever time that? The jump could be in 2 months but you only buy a 1 month contract. If you buy leaps or shares at least you are hedging your bet on when the sudden jump is gonna happen
Are we hoping on fuv boys?

It is pretty garbage software. Takes me like 3 fucking hours to request and adjust my PTO.
No, those are just her current holdings. And I believe she's been holding onto Delta since sometime in May.
What platform /broker is this?
A single high yield bond ETF to support the junk bond market. They weren't buying SPY.

Mortgages are backed by the US government. RKT sells the mortgages it originates... even the MSRs in most instances.  I don’t understand this argument you are trying to make.

Lol why do you give it 2 months? That seems like a really small timeframe. On top of that your options are giving only one month. 

I follow the actually Steven Van Metre yt/twitter and he even preaches a longer timeframe. I'd you're gonna take his name, take his thesis.

The goal here is the sudden jump that may occur starting today. You pick up an option at the very bottom then sell off as soon as the market opens after the rise. Easy 100-300 %
Bill Gates says you are
Sold my SBE  $25C 12/18 for $3.20 when I bought for $110 yesterday. Why did I only grab one... idk but I might jump back in before EOD. CRSR poppin off too, up 71% on $40C 12/18.
What’s the opposite of catching a falling knife? Shoving a knife up your ass? I’m going to call buying puts on a rocket ship being gaddafi’d
This is why I don't buy short term options. If I bought the 1 DTE tomorrow, TSLA only has 1 chance to go to 800, but with my 8 days call, we have 6 more chances.
hit with the ladies this one
11/27 395c seem a little optimistic lol but just might work all we need is one good sentence of positive news on stimulus and those just might print. I have 65, 67 and 70c
I did just buy a ps5 bundle from GME so they have a definite sale of $1000 so that could mean the stock goes up right?
GME is alive again!?

"The most straightforward answer to this question is that it actually disappeared into thin air, along with the decrease in demand for the stock, or, more specifically, the decrease in investors' favorable perception of it."

" \[...\] you're holding a stock and the price drops, leading you to sell it for a loss. The person buying it at that lower price–the price you sold it for–doesn't necessarily profit from your loss and must wait for the stock to rise before making a profit."

The company that issued the stock doesn't get the money from your dealing stock price either. The brokerage firm is also left empty-handed since you only paid it to make the transaction on your behalf."

Hey, GJ on the DD. There is a couple problems however. 

&#x200B;

The main one is your historical projection. Since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century the stock market has become increasingly separate from the "real economy." This has caused a fake economy to develop according to economists, a trend that has only increased under the tech boom of the last 20 years. Basically this is a trend that people have been projecting for the past 5 decades. Every month somebody else has a prophesized "pop" date, a date when the market plummets. 

&#x200B;

Ill tell you whats going to happen. The market explodes and everyone cries for a bit and shifts more of their portfolio into the tech sector. The reason behind this is because of the insane P/E and EBIT. The Market wont crash because of one primary reason as listed below. 

&#x200B;

THE PRIMARY REASON: 

If the western world's market starts to fall as your projecting then the U.S will go to war with another nation to exploit the resource drain. This happened in the Cold War, WWII, and WWI. If the big industries start to decline then the United States will bail them out, the 2008 crisis showed that. If the tech sector decides to sell coal instead of Iphones then people will just transition their investments.

In other words nothing is going to change and your options will expire worthless.

Wait, so you’re also bearish on this? What’s your reasoning?
TSLA under $500 is gonna seem like a distant dream in a couple weeks. buy every dip
Leverage tesla and amd, and some palantir. Wish me luck Æ
The next fake-selloff should provide opportunity pretty much anywhere.

I agree 100% but good luck timing it. Market can remain in lala land for longer than you think.
What did you buy at? Just look at its intrinsic value for the easiest ballpark answer, at 18.82 if it stays right there they'll be worth 32 bucks each (obviously a tad more at open).

what? I'm not talking about it going up or down.  I'm just wondering why at any point it was 250k for a share.  Did the company start and initially only have 1 share and more got sold diluting that 1 share?
This stock is fueled by WSB.

My cost basis is so fucking low that even with a massive sell-off, I'll be so far ahead. Let the talkers talk, I'll be making dough regardless. This thing hits $100, I'll have enough for a 20% down payment on a house in the Bay Area, and I still wouldn't buy it, because then that means I have enough for 40% down literally everywhere else.

Your analysis of the credit markets shouldn't focus exclusively on commercial loans. The consumer loan side is hot as hell. The housing market is red hot both new homes and re-sale. Car sales (no, not just TSLA you autists) are way up. Businesses are not taking out loans. Individuals are for big purchases. In other words, the money printer is going brrr.

where do you see tesla in a month ?
Ok you don’t understand why tech when up cause of covid...

Tech went up because adoption was accelerated.  So pretty much in everyone model old people were never gonna pay with an app or shop with an app. So every year tech grows as old people die and young people adopt the new technology.

So COVID said hey old people you need to learn how to use an app or you will have a chance of dying.  So old people were like shit better learn how to use e-commerce so I don’t die.  So now all tech models showing adoption had to change.

Once there is a vaccine that is distributed you have to ask will it change how people use technology.  Probably not old people will be like “I’m old and tired why would I fight traffic go to the store and shop when someone can bring them to me.” 

So the adoption accelerated the user base, but it’s not going to revert back.  For example Disney hit 2025 Disney+ subscriber numbers this year at 70 million .... so you think after the vaccine that number is going to drop down to 20 million because that’s where it was projected before COVID... the answer is no

And if you think it’s yes then you are a Patrick
thats a man

Tyson managers make $50-$60k a year on average, not millionaires, i worked there for 4 years.

Oh, you want the goods goods?

Alrighty meng tin foil hat time and I better not get any shit for it. 

Lockdown phase 2 = stoinks go up, 
stimmy check v2 = stoinks go up,
Crsr massively undervalued = stoinks go up
Logi sells for 80$ so I can buy 2 shares of crsr for same price 
= Stoinks go up
Crsr had blow out earnings just like Logi = Stoinks go up

Honestly I turned off my brain today, sold my last 6 30$ 12/18 and reloaded into 40$ 12/18 bought 20 and If I hold long enough I can sell each of these bad boys for 1k each or more depending On how Diamond my hands will be since 20k is still 20k.

I also have 20$c 5/21 -- 30$c 5/21 -- 35$c 5/21 holding a couple of each so my belief is q1 next year will be just duumb dumb good and we could go to 70-80ish like Logi. 

Okay take off tin foil hat my head hurts.

Good luck man

Me too
Guess you're holding for a while
GME SUB 12 HERE WE GOOOOO
I was gonna say, its benefited me. It's not perfect, but it gives me access to markets I did not previously have.
but they fix that shit right? i don't mind as long as they fix it
Typical wsb retard
My mother's also been handing the market its own ass for literally decades. This is just what happens when she decides to take a riskier position than she's ordinarily comfortable with.
This is the way.
Last 30 min sour hour, last chance to buy the dip before this shit moons tmmrw for no fucking reason
I love how some people actually sell their NIO shares when it’s 12 dollars under the stocks current value I love it. Then they buy back in at a high price and lose even more money. 💎 🙌 baby that’s why my bank account is nice
Wtf TSLA??
What's with these fake ass quick pumps and dumps
Gross
nah i sold credit spread, i need them to expire otm by tomorrow
riced in. vaccine? riced in
Bet market goes bear after morons realize they don't even understand what it is they sell.
Cmon PLTR push you're about to give birth to a brand new baby 19
I don't see you talking about the two to four trillion dollar stimulus which is going to get passed a couple days after the orange loser leaves office.
They aren’t talking stimulus
IV about to fuck everyone up
Lockdown is good for the market. Have you not been following?
ev stocks 📈
I bought once at 14 and once at 21...now I'm down to my last 100 shares and LEAP. 48 still just seems too high for me to actually enter again....
Stim talks were false. Its not about covid relief
Just dumped absolutely everything and went cash.
I cashed out at 20% or so

SPY and TSLA going in opposite directions
Sounds like a clout chasin poser to me! He just wants you to watch his YouTube videos, see his comment below. Ban
Buy all that you can
NIO shares bring all the boys to the yard
So you’re telling me that palantir is such an insidious company, with its software and business practices, that George Soros wont fucks with them?

And I’m not supposed to buy more at their present ATH?

Why I keep selling jPM calls in a green market?
Pug pull inevitable
yup, this is the truth.  My port has been fucked sideways 'cause I thought I knew better...  Just going with it now, TSLA 11/20 $600c  TQQQ 11/20 $155c   

fuck it...
Nope
I kinda just loaded up on 336 puts for the 27th 😂 wml
Is it just me, or did the "talks going well" update suck all the money out of speculative tech plays and rotate it into boomer reopening stocks?
I’m waiting till NIO pulls back then buying 1/15 calls
Around 500 shares at 18.50
they somehow taste worse than regular beer in a can too
"stim talks going well" always seem to come in at the perfect times when SPY needs it

i swear these gov officials are staring at their portfolios all day, its ridiculous
[removed]
You're gonna try to tell me TSLA won't rip to 550 tomorrow? ALL. IN.

Nah, jk. I'm gonna avg down a bit on my 500s if they let me, but not going over 5% of my portfolio on this one.
Gaxy moon mission confirmed 😍🚀🚀🚀
>It will actually pay out post 2021, most likely 2022.
11/20 18.5c has a theta of -.2110. Delta is only .3559. If it opens at the same level tomorrow as it is now you $58 a call could drop to $37 or lower. 

Just estimates though.
FUCK TESLA WALMART IS THE MOVE
CRSR GME
“I am inevitable”- SPY $360

How come no one talking about FUV
I’m dying laughing
no way zm is not going up. schools are closing...covid ramping up. everyone i know is getting it and stuck at home...
prob going to hit new all-time highs soon as we hear "talks going well"
If I could snag a GLE I’d definitely do it, only reason I lean GLB is we don’t have kids yet so don’t need the extra space and GLB has that sexy brand new screen that goes across the entire dash also which is what I want haha. Can get a loaded GLB for the price of a mid range GLE is my main influence atm
Couldn’t sell my gains once again due to PDT, worst fucking rule ever.
Good chance you're right. 12/8 earnings is my mental safety net lol.  Still hoping it'll pop on news of a deal with a sony or something else before then.
Who here is in MGNI?
Yes keep it up soldier
Holy shit.
How can FUV puts not be the move?

They're fuckin golf carts

this makes me think a hard strike in inflation is about to happen. the dollar is literally becoming so undervalued with this pandemic. literally everyone and their mother is cashing in.
Duhhhh
Wait a bit after opening so it can drop then go in
Becky did a HIIT class that was too hard.
You actually made me buy shares just now. In for 500 shares of PFE
Since I fuck wit u bro lemme give u some good DD on DG 

\*\*DG\*\* 

Has not had a single year where store openings has gone down. In fact, just opened their 17,000th store, last year they had 15,400 stores or some shit.

Has not had a single year, quarter, where same store sales have been down. in fact coronavirus has made shoppers more cost-caring and going to these dicount store (DG is NOT a dollar store, like DLTR, they're more like a cheaper WMT)

I'm betting they hit $230 after earnings, also IV is very low on some of these options as if earnings isn't happening. very interesting, i expect a bigger move into earnings. 

\*\*AES\*\*

nothing much here. its a very diverse company that supplies energy in places like Argentina, Brazil, and also the US and Europe. They struggled from currency devaluations but recently set up contracts to make all payments in dollar-denominated amounts 

only other piece of info is they'd probably do well under biden administration, they are shifting away from coal and gas and moving to solar and wind. and especially being able to store this energy in batteries for when its dry or dark out.

Lastly, and probably the most important thing for AES, is just like FISV, someone has been buying calls and executing them and rolling them out. Ex. Last sept/oct they bought a shitton of 19calls, those went ITM. now they have 22calls (22,000 OI/volume)
I have this problem where I bought stocks low and now they're high.
even better 😖
Can tech just moon already? Holy fuck what a gay ass day
That's fair, riskier but the hyper growth stage is coming for them right now. I guess I'd rather stick to the safest option.
The very top, where the fuck else 😅
[deleted]
Yeah, tried to message you to thank you as well. Even with the way you talked to us I'll accept it if the tips are good. I got a Dec call on this thing and it's already up a nice amount. How long would you suggest I hold it for, all the way through? Should I buy more to expire in summer 21?
AMD is like Queen. "I want to break free!!"

NIO is going to no less than triple by next year maybe even 4X or 5
You missed the part where the vaccine wont change anything for at least a year. It is 90% effective. If you were an obese boomer with diabetes would you take a 10% chance of getting covid? They won't. At least 1/3 of all boomers won't go back to normal without the virus completely gone first. Probably 1/10 of paranoid gen x and y will do the same. Half of the entire US won't get the vaccine because they don't trust Trump or were they were anti vaccine before covid. The virus won't be widely available for at least 6 months even if everyone would get it.

Nah to have a next tesla you need a next elon. Thiel is no elon.
>yes but that's when they pump it another 5-10% and then dump
If it could start manipulated above $24 tomorrow that'd be nice
The comments don’t matter if he’s just shitting on EV competition but this is a good question.
I bought shares on the dip, 11/10..... up 85% already.
please dont start fuckin woofing at me.... i already had a haunch that you were a furry too
jpow pulled out the emergency back-up ink
I saw ORCL and WMT alerts on unusual whales this morning, might be a good gamble.
KNDI mooning
Palantir says bend over
same here. I am at 50% which is my largest cash position this year.  I was thinking we would get a pullback and have a strong rally into the end of the year.  Looks like we might just go sideways and the go up. 

It is hard to put money to work right here.
Hold til Q1 2021
CRSR
Yes
so this is a good entry point right?

they are back to pumping stimulus which means we are gonna be seeing a lot more "stim talks going well" these next few days
I keep telling yall JPM!
You lying bitch. Let's see the proof!
CORN
So this guy deletes his account must of been a wallstreet wale showing off his account
im holding it until 2021 so it can rollover to next year's taxes </3
I'm holding until tomorrow
Dec 31, 2021, I think it can. That'd be a P/E of like 8. Def depends on what the overall market does next year though.
We keep getting rejected at 19 we are consolidating for a move up or a sharp move down 5 percent on this stock is way different Than other stocks genius
Tomorrow
Those bottle-shaped cans of beer are absolute dogshit. They advertise it like "oooh you get so much more beer" but in reality half of your beer fucking foams over so you probably get EVEN LESS beer. This is bullshit.

Only good aspect of them is that when you re-cap them and throw the empty cans into a fire they explode.
The DD would literally get downvoted on this sub yet somehow tanked the stock. Unbelievable. NIO is the best of the Chinese EVs and the one with the most likely growth outside of China so I can see Tesla levels in the future for this. Let’s make that money my guy 🤜
Why on earth would anyone buy stocks at the top when theres lockdowns coming
Spy is either due for a big breakout, or a 10% pullback correction over the next 2-3 weeks

That chart was almost a perfect head and shoulders but today threw it off
I’ve seen one they are ducking amazing and better than Tesla’s
POSITIONS OR BAN
I'm in
Hmm, this post is really long and detailed. 
I think the market will be going up just to spite your hard work, thanks for the easy gains thou
all depends on when and price for sure, hope you do ok. 100s of 1000s were bought yesterday afternoon when price was up between 600-1000% by end of day, those calls are all toast i imagine...and down we go again, what a payday for the MM

You didn't sell at open?  When did you buy?
should i buy more baba calls? up on my calls and bout to break even on my shares
Velocity of money is also good indicator of current situation since it proved that money doesn't go to circulation but instead it stays in bank accounts
You didn't, it was just a general statement
Damn their bosses, can't these slaugher-house workers do that shit remotely?
I'm happy to hold my 1000 shares AND see bullish posts all day about it
Growth and spec stocks  have  run up like wild lately these stocks are buck wild out here lol 🌙🌙🌙🚀 🚀🐎🐎

go back to your parents basement
You call dropping 4 dollars a dump after it went up 100 dollars in less than a week?
Gonna buy a metric fuck ton
I love it long term, but I don't think I'd let that ride overnight
I’m a big TSLA fanboy, but I’m pretty sure there was a string of bumpers literally falling off Tesla’s for awhile
When life gives you a lemon, you squeeze it to make short sellers suffer
Gonna sell my calls before 10:30 tmr
I'm sitll in nio bro. all good
What just happened?
I bet they'll give guidance next EC. And they'll give insights to what to expect.
Where did I knock Robinhoood?
They don’t fear it as much today lol
Anyone else have the feeling we’re going to crash soon
They arent gonna let PLTR past 20 this week because they know you all bought calls expiring tomorrow

So if the dnkn buyout falls through, the $5 2023 leaps will go back to being worth normal, right?
Ah I understand that.  GLB over the GLE? The GLE is so beautiful. Can't go wrong with either though
Am I a bull if I buy TZA calls?
Ima stop Henriks lights out if he don’t pump this shit
Wtf do I do with CIIC

I need someone to help me out and tell me if I missing any of the gangs (newest to oldest), it’s for a gif 

PLTR 
NIO 
SLV
PRPL
RKT

What else?
u right, but what about the 2000% left on the table??
Maybe if it can stabilize at 19 at close. It's honestly a resistance point whether I pump more money into it, or I start thinking about closing positions near mid Dec.
They are ditching the EV market & sold a shit ton of shares for $3.50, no reason to stay
Okay I FOMO'd when do the tendies arrive?
Pltr 11/20 19c
SOLO calls or puts for tomorrow? Watcha got?
SRAC. Get it before it pops off this upcoming month. Calls are cheap.
What's the gameplan for the ABNB IPO? All in?
Someone dumped 1m+ shares at market price it looks like.
Yo Hold me back on dropping 1k on SOLO! my guts telling me is a FOMO move but fuck!
hilarious!
Me too man. NIO 35c and AMD 100c, to the moon 🚀
oof power hour time here comes the sell off for some of the stonks
Yer
I need a virtual friend to talk about my options gambling addiction.
It broke for like 3 minutes and then got completely rejected down to 18 flat again.
Possible 550m offering
Unreal that SPY ends green
im holding $360 11/20
Coz I’m holding calls
All in on CRSR and SOLO like a true degenerate
And there’s the bull flag
Vegas shutdown coming? Puts on mgm?
>Globee

Which one exactly? Btw aren't they only coming out with numbers in January? Though I also think that Christmas sales could be big for them
I’m holding. It will feel too bad to eat a loss now after all the TSLA gains this week
We left at $10
Hold off till tomorrow or maybe Monday. Always pumps a day or two longer than you would expect
"No lose trade"?

Sounds like it literally cannot go tits up!

I forgot how many scooters with lead batteries there are in China but it’s millions.

For real?
Too expensive. Wait...
It’s not actually news that Teslas are unreliable...they’ve had poor ratings (not personal satisfaction, the actual cars) for a while. It’s actually dumping because people are just now reading an article?

Aren’t they releasing the details of the new model after market today?
Exactly moment when it was gaining momentum. So bullshit
any TSLA profit taking gonna happen?
Ticker will be SMP

You obviously never traded Tesla so you wouldn’t know...
I would say more meme exposure but I’ve been busy with work this week so my perception may be diff than yours
If by success you mean “make a little money over decades” then yeah sure. Nobody’s gotten rich from index funds.
As a guy who's balls deep in calls, why? Because this is the first green day in a while?
This guy uses autopilot
Looks like Tesla not ready to break out

We're not gonna hit 40 bro LMAO as much as I would love that
They literally just said model Y will hurt its profits. They offered no DD, just pure speculation bullshit. We just got 5 something price upgrades in the past few days. Plus they’re building 2 new sedans and Nio day is around the corner. 

Way too many good variables here

Okay i can't believe I've to actually break it down. On one hand, we've degenerates yoloing hoping to get rich quick on crazy ass bets. 9/10 go belly up. Of course it is painful, but funny because almost everyone of them saw this happening yet continued.

On the other side, you've these millionaire assholes who are forcing people to work for minimum wage in a pandemic so they can continue to make money, a place where workers literally died because of covid. And they're betting on how many of these workers will get covid!? Of course one might find it hilarious as I initially did, but it is disgusting as i later realized.
I mean they're gunna beat earnings and pump due to Christmas/holiday sales and new console new games hype, idk I'm just a retard that wants money

Love the ambition, I am thinking 75 EOY. As this is listed in the US as an ADR whenever the stimulus lands, I think we will see 100+.

TSLA puts? Seems to fall quick after spikes looking at the 3month chart
I hate TA as much as the rest of you but look at the SPY 6 months chart, and trace the line from 9/2.... I wonder what happens next
That’s a hell of a pump with what time is left
That would’ve been great lol
In Kentucky it’s $15/hr?
Too strong dude it’s not going to come down. Every dip is bought up
Real talk, your fine. Fridays are historically bad for Nio lol

This should be on a shirt

We’re a bunch of bears in this bitch
All in at all time highs I got it

Dude peloton and zoom why the fuck are you doing this
If literally everything is priced in there would be no moves at all.

TSLA go up or down tomorrow!??  😬
Eat shit SPACS are free money
almost 1,000,000 tsla 500c bought yesterday and today, wonder how many just lost out on that move - and will not recover, unless it really pumps now

NIO releasing details of the new model today, right??
No-one can answer this except for your own balls. Are your nuts made out of steel or paper, are they tingling because you feel a massive run is in the books tomorrow or are they trying to shrivel back inside your body because they know you are about to get fked. Only you (your balls) will know. Risk tolerance and how large your positions (% of portfolio) are will dictate your answer. You could lose 17% today or lose 75% tomorrow, or you could be up 200%.

If the squeeze were to happen I think it begins with earnings tbh even though the new consoles is prob already priced in. I'm in on 12/31 calls so we need Cohen to fuckin force some hands here and get this puppy rolling.
Thank you for your service.

If we make it to January, there will likely be another huge covid19 stimulus which will give markets another shot in the arm and keep things pumping for another 3-6 months.

What you wrote makes rational sense, but the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

shut the fuck up loser
as an eurocuck living in the US, i can't help but get the feeling I'm constantly being fucked over financially here. from insurance to housing or to even having a bank account. i was shocked to find out there's a monthly fee for not having money in your account at most banks

fuck, being poor here in the US must fucking suck. thank fuck I'm loaded to the tits with NIO calls
You. Will. Be. Rewarded. Patience.

Yes. It's going to be 600+ by the end of the year probably. If not that, hold on to it because it's going to be the next big big eventually, joining the likes of the largest market cap companies publicly traded.

Pitchfork, chicken feet. Whatever W is.  People just selling gains to buy FDs.
Stop the count.
The one that actually gets billions in revenue and profits is being outpaced by companies that are eating losses.

It’s mind boggling. I’m holding the shares for now...
I’ve sold 1/4th of my NIO and reinvested elsewhere. I feel good about them but then again I got in much cheaper

There's no reason for the stock to go up before earnings.

Hey man it's not a competition, things go up and down naturally. If you can make gains doing puts at the right time power to ya

I feel you, thankfully mine were only $28k and I had a lot of overseas/overtime work that helped me pay off huge chunks at a time, or I'd still be paying them for another 6 years. I think any loan forgiveness should be coupled with more price controls on colleges that accept federal student loans, the amount spent on administrative personnel, sports, and campus amenities is out of control.

Wow $32 million worth of volume at 1pm got me on Zillow
PLTR need it to be over 20 today. Fingers crossed.
Yep if you don’t need the cash now. I update the stop-loss daily so profits are secured but I doubt a big dip anyway if there is a dip it’ll be the same as today

This also does not meet yolo requirements.

BABA is 290-335 calls and CCL and NCLH is 1 ITM I think 18.5 and 20.5
sell some shit, not too late

Daily TSLA crash

First ones always free
All publicity is good publicity
Goodbye today’s gains
For real!
It's hydroponics and vertical farming too - checked the pics online. Really like those but wonder how these would be as investments
I def think it’ll go over 20 but how long and far out is the question. It’s pretty damn risky now. I got in at 13 and bought a 16c 11/27 on Monday so I’m somewhat safe. But we’re all retards so fuck it, buy now ath today. Stonks go up
If you EVER make another long post like this again, I'm going to do more coke.
Took NIO with it :(
that's why you tie up millions for 100,000's profit
PLTR will never break 19 I’m convinced
Cruise lines are in the tard strength category now

Oh yea I’m holding this long long term, but damn imagine what could’ve been if Citron hadn’t turned up
Okay 50$ nio holder
I bought NIO puts 10 min ago wish me luck
Yes it really does. Tiny market cap. I'm up 84% but I guess I'll hold fuck it
Got a cardboard box tip: $IP and $WRK
The price for cardboard across the top 5 companies is going to increase tomorrow by $50/ton. It’ll be announced in Pulp and Paper. I believe with the holiday season coming and everyone ordering more and more packages online. The need for cardboard is there and these companies will see a spike. They could also see a spike if the price for all those boxes is going to go up. I’m in calls but I think there’s a play to be made here.
Nio bear trap
TSLA is garbage car to own

Nio leaps are cheaper and Nio is still in a rapid growth stage that could see its price explode in a 2 year period. Not saying Tesla won’t but Tesla was pretty stagnant until the S&P inclusion.
My all time chart looks like it needs a dip. Worrisome
Yes, lots of room to the upside as people continue to rebalance away from the stay at home stuff.

Explain SOLO to me like I am a child. What gives since earnings? 100+% share appreciation!
Explanation for RIDE tanking?
Someone much richer than all of WSB combined is holding NIO hostage and they need to go

Best we can do is 500 today sir
Shares? WTF!
We're poor
Volume is falling on TSLA, doubt that 500 will hold, should be back by premarket tomorrow though.

my wife keeps giving me the silent treatment, but the jokes on her -- i already got plenty of that from my parents which is why i'm like this.
Wish I had more money to throw in🙏
I'm always very interested in agro-tech so thanks for posting this. But wondering how this scales up because we are talking an industry with razor thin margins.
Did y’all miss out on FUV today? Sold calls for 100% profit this morning, if I held til now could’ve sold at 20,900%
[removed]
FUV is only at 49.77% now.
why does the solo car look like a human born with no arms and legs.

You’ll spend more money paying that advisor than the gains you made 🤣
Spy 360 tomorrow ?
i had the strategy to wait for the post earnings dip to buy NVDA. Instead I went all in yesterday and am down bigly now.
God you somehow made yourself sound even dumber than your original post. Bravo. I will enjoy watching your puts go to -99%

I entered previous positions before: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the_bears_arent_done_folks_these_diamond_hands/

I exited those positions for a large profit when it became clear to me that market wasn't ready to tank yet. Here I am at another top in the same positions.

I can ride this shit all year if I have to.

Down 50% today and the delta went from .8 to .4 lol. This one might expire worthless
I called the ACB pop a few weeks ago. Rode that wave for 4000-6000%. 

Rolled that into 12/4 ZM $412c and TSLA 11/20 $465c =profit

Really happy I grabbed an extra thousand shares of PLTR yesterday. 

Now if only I was smart enough to buy a month ago.
"200/5" lmaooooo
TSLA puts lol

Got you fam <3
This feels like a price probe into the $357.50 trading range by the bulls. I feel like they are testing the waters until we sell off in the next 20 minutes or so.
>Unless the dollar gets completely destroyed

Spoiler: it will.  Hedge with metals, shitcoins or real estate.  Alternatively just short the dollar if you don't wanna be left holding the bag.
As in literally?

I want to jump in but scared of bag holding .. will it dip before pushing again
Hell yea brother enjoy my free $80

Why do some of your - have a line going above and below, dirt?
Listen to this guy. We're day traders, not in for the long run.
His portfolio is the same size as mine basically. I started with $150k Jan 1st and I'm sitting at $670k today. Most of my portfolio is tsla.

Pltr !
Where is she now?
That one seem sketchy, its on my watch list, 6 employees and a fuck ton of volume ...wish I pivoted into that today, but NIO is alright
Should have up 60% already!
Majority of that gain was from 400 shares of NIO at $1.96
suwoooop (the sound of our portfolios rising)
I dunno, if you hopped on this morning you made out like a bandit.
Of course women like that aren’t on tinder. They have legions of thirsty guys in their reach in real life

SOURCE: IM A BBW TINDER FUCKER
Yes
Genuine question, why get NIO leaps instead of TSLA?
PLTR up 3% from where I bought my 12/18 calls but just now breaking even 🤬
Can I get a pltr gang check in
18, yeah I might hold if it doesn't spike today
LOL honest af.  I'm in GME too and i'd love that. 

I think the squeeze is expected to be a several week thing predicated on news or something to start off and then snowballing based on algo reactions to price rises. It'd be great to see it start rolling this week though. My Jan calls are starting to make me nervous.
Lol a 10% move in GME barely a 2 bagger on weeklies.

This is why you don't buy 100+% IV options unless you're scalping
I had to adjust my chart. It’s a bear flag
Maybe not today, possibly tomorrow, but at a minimum we’re looking at Covid skyrocketing the country over and some dipshits doubling down on stupid policy (Texas governor is about as dumb as can be). 

We’ve already got people traveling for thanksgiving and rates are at an all time high. It’ll cascade in a couple of weeks and hospitals are already full. Hospitalization lags 4 weeks too, so I think the second week of December may see a countrywide lockdown. Imagine the market reacting to that.
ahhh shit you're right
Real question:  what does Sarah Eisen smell like?

My guess is lavender and matzah

Look at you being all diversified.
Pltr 20 11/20 are cheap for lotto tickets.
The best part about investing is making steady gains for a few months so you decide totl treat yourself to something nice and the next day your portfolio plummets

Been telling people not to FOMO and buy weeklies on Thursday. 

FOMOed and bought a weekly on Thursday.
38 minutes until CIIC pumps again.
rihgt now tsla could end at 496 or 504
Maybe my crayons are wrong and TSLA is just going to get pinned to $500 tomorrow
If only we knew what INVST stood for
Too late.

Palantir is perfectly stable right? I feel like I should see little risk dropping $25,000 in stock along with my options

Anyone else feel that tomorrow will be bigly green?
I fell for this once. Not again. I'm just gonna do the opposite because the market is illogical and always goes up.
Hold PLTR to tmrw?
Hahahaha same that was the joke
u good!
Any thoughts on NAKD??
[removed]
my start up
Feels bad to have been a week early on NIO and XPEV. Theta has fucked me. Get your gains and bounce bois
I'm with you on the bearish bet, I think your timing is 1-3 months early. 

Re banks adding tier1 capital (treasuries): they are padding their capital reserves ahead of REALIZING losses. Between the stimulus and what regulators are telling banks, noone is marking down their loan portfolios yet. If given the option, bankers will put their fingers in their ears and ignore accounts past due as long as they can. I think that stress through policy has been pushed to Q1 2021.

I'm long QQQ puts for March and TSLA stock until just before XMas. Then I'll load up short in the first weeks of January.
really hope so, pretty sure GME calls are the only thing carrying my portfolio right now
I own 55% BABA 1/15/21 calls, 15% CCL NCLH puts 11/27, 10% KCAC and CIIC stock and 20% cash. Rate my portfolio.
Dude timing puts is the most retarded play you can make. Tesla, PRPLE, NIO, RKT, any meme stock, is way less retarded than trying to time puts. You're never going to time it right fuck!
Grab me one of them pretzels please.
Because that holds up some of my portfolio for another year +. And 90% of people here are looking for gambles that hit like crack
Literally makes no sense it’s mind boggling. This really must be what a bubble feels like

Daddy teach me
calls or puts right here on spy?
If you look at console release dates the past 3 gems and GME stock you’ll see a jump in share price by like 3x. Makes sense regardless if they don’t buy games for much it’ll still be a major part of their business buying low and selling high used games. 
The only downside is now most video games can be purchased digitally or streaming a subscription service Xbox game pass or the PS Now.

Passed the heroes stimulus with national ballot harvesting and illegal immigrant payments in it so it had zero chance of passing? Is that how she helped the little guy?
OK. thanks.
I’m not too sure if PLTR has much more to give ?
BABA leaps
Hold tesla 500 call 11/20/20 till tomorrow or sell before close
I’m saying what goes up rocket high always comes down. Law of average you degenerate retard
STIMULUS TALK AGAIN?? THATS WHAT MOVED THE MARKETS? 🤣
GME 😂😂
Yes indeed
I hope so
How lol
Are they growing vegetables vertically? I’m not in on any ag that isn’t vertical.
Good post. Not happening tho. We are heading up, stop the nonsense bear talk and deal with it. Between vaccines, new president, and companies continuing to beat earnings idk how you could say otherwise. Is there scared bears out there? yes, can they move the market a bit? Sure, but we are heading up. We could have a slight 10% drop, then hang on for all time highs.
Down goes TSLA
it was way overdue after ER
Unless the dollar gets completely destroyed, igniting an inflationary megabubble where people are forced to chase stonks just to preserve their capital, this might not be the best time to deploy capital into the market for a 6-12 month time horizon.

Finally something to make me feel better. I’ve been pumping cash into my home instead of this market.

VTRS ON A SMALL DROP. BUY THAT SHIT!!! THIS STOCK IS A GOLD MINE
According to unusual whales it is
This day has been flatter than my sisters tits
tsla is trash
Up 3% what in the god damn autism are you try to fucking say
All that shit for a 350p?   


you could have just said markets are ATH and due for a pullback lol
That is why EVs are so hot right now, lol
I’ve always wondered what they would do if you got restricted again.
PLTR GOGOGO
not when scalpers going bonkers
I was expecting a slight pull back and was hoping for 10% profit
This
Bad move...they CRUSHED earnings
I hope it pulls a NIO, lasts until EOY
I know WSB is autistic but 700 naked puts at $10 for a stock like PLTR?
Yeah I recommend it. It got beaten down hard and is massively oversold IMO. I bought in EOD yesterday and it's going well so far.
shut up about how they look just follow the trend
AYRO
For what, 2023?
I’ve been feeling pretty gay all week too but have just been missing out as the market keeps pumping past me
Tomorrow
I'm retarded

56 million right at opening
Fuck this pandemic - I am going to Disney world
The one mil share wall was on the ask on PLTR at around $20. At least it was yesterday when I last looked at L2. I assumed that’s what you were referring to.

EDIt: shit, realized I responded to the wrong comment earlier. My bad
Buy puts when it hits 60. Just give me my 50c and we’ll be fine retard. Godspeed
PLTR $20 tomorrow.
Load up on SPY $365C 11/25. 

Don't ask why, just do it.
Well, IDK about money you pulled out of your account but anyone can chart TSLA and see that it's about where it was at the end of August.
I got back in at $43, I'm loving today

Damn Canadians. Go back ehh.
NIO $49 EOD?
At the top no less 😎
you also just described a Prius when they first came out, and those damn things are everywhere.

I don't think theres anyone really worth following on Stocktwits, all the good ones (if there are any) are on Twitter. The people with big followings on ST are all penny pumpers, SPAC coomers, or they just shill wsb meme stocks.

I use it for the watchlist and boards tho

Why not 75% PLTR 25% XPEV? I have a similar play with a different EV but XPEV is good
Cant stop wont stop

I burst laughing! This movie needs to be made!
Waterfall?
I’m stealing this
$19 be eod
You are right in that every mortgage company and their mother is doing very well with the low rates. Difference in RKT is their brand, technology and disruption in the mortgage market space. They have more opportunity to take a larger share of the pie than their competition and have lower costs. This creates opportunity IMO.

And yes I hold RKT shares.
Just gonna say it, I think SOLO is gonna be a big flop. Those cars are rolling deathtraps, imagine hitting a deer in one of those tiny things? Or getting T boned? You are 100% fucked, and they are also just ugly as fucking hell.
Is PLTR a daily meme or weekly?
All in C**C

Censored for the unaware
I know. So just wait until SPY is bigly green and this shit will be humongous green
u back bro?
CRSR $40 eow
Guys, just remember...in end whatever decision you make...it’s the wrong one.

Duh you think anything other than natural resources coming out of africa is worth anything?

This isn't an bad future for everyone. This would stop autists from buying the dip on day 1 only for it to tank 20% on the second day

I think it’s NIO puts now.
420 by 2021?
Because no one in here knows shit
I hope you’ll be the official tik tok fleshlight once they Invade

and kiddos will return for freeish university haha
Geely? GELYF
PLTR chart doesnt look like its having a seizure for once
...? 200—-> 2500 and back to 2500 post split what is your point. You’d have had maybe two weeks to nail a put and would’ve had sell almost immediately to not get absolutely railed.

it's whatevre I only have a small holding because no margin on that ticker
Oooo. See, it is interesting when you comment about calls! Cuz I've never heard of VRM before. Ty for the new ticker.

Ah, I have done shit like that so many times. When I first started trading like 5 years ago I had a vertical put spread on IBM for earnings cause everybody hates IBM, and I put it on backwards, needless to say.... I did not make any money lol.

Tsla will not move

Don’t you dare ruin a good thing for me....
thats a long time lol, but i bet its gradual and rewarding...i have a massive loss this year as well, i need to make it back lmao i think im converting to theta gang
SPY and EV have no correlation what so ever
I only think this because it'd be good for my positions, BUT most of us who are bullish on GME think a major squeeze is coming any day
BLNK seriously gonna close above 19.
Nice.
Dollar general needs to get into the sububurbs.
AAPL $200
PLTR gunna make me coom
Got some March calls
[deleted]
This is my dilemma
So do we hold or dump here?
For real though, gotta be NIO puts if it pushes $60 right?
It’s an undervalued company you retard. People and institutions are buying them up omg how much retarded can you be.
tell me when to buy puts
$AAPL, move over $120 already. I’m licking my lips right now on some fat covered call premium.

$TNA, move your sorry ass over $51 so I can get assigned. I want these shares off my books.
pltr is the next pltr retard
Fuckn SOLO I had some too until I did the responsible thing and actually looked at their product. Oof
Can nio keep growing holy shit
fucking solo
I bought this shit back in Feb. before you even knew what a corona virus was. I made tons more in March but I played the crash from the beginning.

of course I was a doomer. Though all the retards stocked up on TP for some reason.
Today’s been a doozy for me
What the fuck? How ? Why?
PLTR CRSR 40 EOM AND BABA 300 EOM
USSA.
AYRO 05/21 7.50C
Chill. We need small growth not another meme run.
The fact the market has pretty much returned to normal is completely bonkers. Nothing makes sense anymore, but it won’t be all sunshine and rainbows forever.
Inversed yolo tech calls
No real reason, this is the first day i have seen a generally bullish order flow here when that didn't necessarily need to be the case today and especially over the past few days where BABA should have run up... For what its worth i have had an very lucky streak this week with my plays...
Can't you still sell?  you just cant buy I thought
shark tank unfiltered be like
Im like the guy with the yellow jacket rubbing his hands, licking his lips hiding behind a tree watching other tickers not mentioned here mooning
This was the reason I was skeptical of them. That along with the fact I own a shit ton of their hardware. Absolutely love their product but the app has gone to absolute shit. If I were a new customer I would return that shit asap and buy something else. Made me hold off pulling the trigger on their stock. I thought they would stay flat. I guess that's why I'm a fucking stonk retard and not an autistic!
Throw in free maple syrup and healthcare and I'm in!
>Thats good advice. From now on listen to your mom lol.
What you don't seem to get is that the Fed \*is indirectly\* printing money. By lowering the interest rates, they increase the bonds value and therefore collateral. Funds have to rebalance their portfolios and buy stonks.
I’m sucking myself off to pltr

Seems like it, I bought into earnings on $BJ as well, but the call expires in December so it has time.
We're probably in for a last hurrah during Christmas if somehow people are still not broke enough to not buy presents

I suspect bears are coming out of the woodwork for TSLA now or soon will be.
Biggest call position right now is VRM

what was the news on them? is because they ended up not getting delisted?
🙏Appreciate it!
Never thought nio would have this amount of growth
Yes
Solo, Nio and Xpev. Fucking ehhhhh
Made the decision imma let my puts expire worthless.

Closing the APP and fapping for the next 43 mins.

See you boys in the what are ur moves tomorrow thread

PLTR MAKE ME PROUD! $20 EOD!

10% roi for a 25 hour trade is solid
What calls you crazies doing with SOLO? I want IN!!
The Tendies were out of stock.
Is there a way to check current day trading status on RH
It can't go up forever can it?
Stimulus is paid for by the Treasury. The Treasury doesn't have that kind of money sitting around so it issues debt as bonds. A lot of the bonds are bought by the Fed printing money. They currently own trillions of dollars worth.
In Thiel we trust. Please fund my MBA with PLTR gains.
Currently in PLTR and NIO true memes. What else should I be in?
my AYRO call is at +4700% today, but i only bought one so it's $35. Welcome to the CLUB
NIO $50 close today, $60 tomorrow, $69 open on Monday
No dollars is weak by each year,  that's why with also money printing we saw this huge rally in many stocks
Pumping all EVs is the next new thing apparently.
Fuck whoever told me to buy RIDE calls yesterday. I sold my SOLO FD's because of it. I hope you feel bad

It’s going to pay of.... maybe
Don't hate the player
Some people don't think it be like that but it do
I hold weeklies for at least a full trading day,

Monthlies. 7-10 days.

Leaps- sell and roll out and up 5-10% if it hits over 50% return. 

This is after months of paper handing.

Even if you lose- teaching yourself patience will pay off immensely in long run
For pfizer, the answer is always yes.
because the moon isn’t real
Blinky!
Is JMIA just a pump and dump?
PLTR 19 EOD. Come on!
Looks at SPY. Here comes theta waving its  massive cock around destroying all your calls and puts.
Imagine not selling your TSLA calls at the top.
Only one worse the MS is gayman sackless

gambling ≠ investing
I have a 2020 ecoboost mustang right now. Super fun to drive but I actually just moved from the suburbs to the city kind of unexpectedly due to my job so it’s now me and gfs only car and kind of impractical in the city. Also I can’t take it for joy rides as easily. 

Considering just taking the 4-5k L on it and just leasing a Mercedes GLB or something. Lease so I can scratch my car itch without having to worry about commitment haha
Had a 400% month. God I love options sometimes.
$15min wage homie
XPEV just had a huge day
Bought 10 contracts for 5/21/21 at the $7.5 strike!
Why is it fucking 75 degrees in my house in the fall???
I might regret selling those NIO 11/20 covered 51c
Ahhh this movie was named after a play on words of my portfolio balance!
Alright I’m holding a bunch of 350 spy puts expiring tomorrow should I sell end of day for a massive loss or go for broke and hope Donny fucks shit up tonight?
GME gonna rip again FUARK
Hold or sell TSLA calls down a little now since I bought at top
Look at Tesla lol

All this shit green and SPY barely green. 1% SPY day tomorrow and everything up 500% in theEV world tomorrow
Damn nio at 48.40ish for the longest and I sold my calls, and then it fucking decides to go up fuck me 😒

His money went to the seller. All of it. That’s how it works.

From your own link: “Fortunately, money that is gained or lost on a stock doesn't just disappear.”

Funny that people bitch about stimulus when the market is at ATH.  Shows how far this market is going to crash eventually.  Stimulus is in fact needed and it is the market that is retarded.
Positions or ban
Only 10 at the minute. I get paid next week so might dump a few more in there then. And you?
Short squeeze. Most of the float is short

Positions?
Guys I’m getting really scared for a rug pull soon someone please hold me I’m gay 🌈 🐻
Wonder if GME short squeeze is back in play
Guys, it's fake. Let's start with the obvious - the S&P 500 Index is up around 9.7% YTD, not 2.77%. Am I the only retard here who spotted this?
same fucking thing here, i typed in my address and was at payment info, but then walmart told me out of stock.
Can’t stop, won’t stop, GameStop, Moonshot
$KISS - lick it up
I'm not gonna do that, on the basis that it would reveal to her that I have paid absolutely no attention to her every other time that she's recommended books to me.

What I do know is that she says to read the front page of the paper, never just the business section. Because you're never gonna get one up on the market by doing the things that the market says to do. You have to learn what you can about the world, and then square your investments with your understanding. You can read the financial works to get lots of ideas, but filter them through the prism of your own knowledge and experience.
Euh guys there this hot new stock in town called "PLTR" its a funny LotR meme  


ima need u to purchase it so it hits $19
[deleted]
Why would you bet against the CIA
Some salty fuckers round here
Bought SPY calls strictly because it makes the least amount of sense tbh
Even SOLO...
No, idc about everyone else buying calls. But the day I read about you buying calls, it will actually be interesting.
[deleted]
damn man, its coming back tho
so fuckin dumb we've had a stimulus teased for like 6 months now and the market keeps thinking it'll finally play out THIS time? rip my damn puts
Damn you had me in the first half

PLTR prepare for liftoff 🚀🚀
Seems like you should've just hopped on the train at the station instead of jumping on after it left already.
Luck or are they being restocked already?
Good input. As long as the equity grows im happy. If one expires worthless it'll kill a good chunk of the gains.

cause he probably is pushing these positions at their behest
Yea imma just hold out however long that takes. Could be years. Lucky I bought shares and not options.
yep some random dude telling you that the market will eventually pull back at some point. No shit.
we're going back to 360 aren't we. the only plays to make in this environment are day trades....and i'm all out

fuck
>yuhyuhariana

same except I bought when It was like 60% higher lol
Now buy CloudMD and do it all over again
You said it, a niche, and a very small one that probably doesn’t justify its market cap lol

$CRSR I should take some profits...
Dude that's not the most ideal $400 bet, assuming you bought at $8 a contract. You could have venmo'd me half of that instead, the loss is significantly less and it's also an even more retarded thing to do with your money.
I have no gauge on what it may hit. Nobody rly knows, maybe 300-400
Whoever did the DD post for RVP and got deleted... thanks big dawg. Up 20% already and you told everyone to get in by next Wednesday. What do you know that we don’t... 🧐

Canadian banks are steadily gaining 0.1-0.9% per day and heading back to their pre-pandemic highs without resistance. Either buy shares to capture growth and dividends (~5%) or buy OTM calls X days out at ($Price + $X/2).

Boring but safe.
no but really, how can you find stocks like this? do you use finviz? or do you just enter random letters and hope for the best?
No.

Fuck is going on with Sorrento
PLTR gonna break through $19 by EOD
Anyone playing SDC?
ever worry this is the top for 10 years?
I think their is a very simple solution but it’s going to cause a lot of short term pain. Problem is wealth inequality yes, but it’s mainly driven by poor/inefficient capital allocation - money invested isn’t trickling to benefit consumers and employees. IMO there’s 2 solutions: 1. Raise federal minimum wages to stimulate long term economic growth. 2. Start taxing the shit out of FD’s  to siphon money directly into taxpayer hands. 

Neither of these have a benefit in the short run because of how companies are structured but long term it will help fix things quite a bit.
Well put, man. I’m not sure why you are in mid-range puts when laying out such macro conditions which could well extend beyond the holiday to materialize, but otherwise this is my position entirely. I have $SPXU building now for the long haul dump; $SPY topping puts to follow out through Q1

Damn, this shit was literally 100% of my portfolio a few weeks ago at $16, thought it was overvalued and sold.
I wasn't interested until I saw the car. It's niche for people that live in cities, don't want kids and need an excuse not to give autists rides.
I’m sure Rome said the same things...

Dude I fucking hope so. I bought calls on them yesterday
If I could daytrade options it would be game over.. For my portfolio
Haven’t been in the stock market in 6 months. Just bought calls. Thank me for the crash tomorrow.
They won't listen
Gordon's an assclown when it comes to TSLA. He's a great gay bear on pretty much everything so I got curious about what he does recommend and one of his buy recommendations is CSIQ - Canadian Solar. Wouldn't have found this baby if not for Gordon so thanks..I guess?
But $CIIC
no way.. swing trading tesla puts has kept me floating today.
If America turns into Ameripoor with stimulus talks pushing into 2021 then stocks like DG (Dollar General) will probably do well since people are just scraping by until Uncle Sam's dollars arrive
most likely
In functionality android beats apple no problem, same goes for their stores in my opinion. Plus android is trying to improve their brand and their looks, while apple is regressing with their removal of the headphone Jack and their constantly changing power cord. But apple does beat android in market because it has a considerably better User interface and a better User experience
Lol that background/environment is one of the free Unreal Engine assets from a few months back.
NIO!
Everything is blood green, stupid as fuck. All because some cunt made some bullshit up about stimulus talks being back on the table. Dude NYC is on lockdown and restaurants won’t have indoor dining. I’m so, so mad right now I swer
Why would I post when I buy calls?

Stocks going up is the norm, and the fact that everyone spams about having calls, like it's interesting, is one of the many reasons this sub sucks ass
Nobody is laughing at NIO now huhh suck my dick NIO bears I literally begged this chat to buy the dip at $42 not once, but Fucking 3 times
Pullback max to 13 or 14? Imagine the room growth now,
Can't PLTR just stop for a fuckin' minute? I want it but it keeps on going up!

SBE GOING TO MARS! This SPAC is doing a reverse merger with Charge Point, an EV charging station which owns 60% of the charging station market in North America. While everyone keeps dick sucking NIO and TSLA, SBE is flying under the radar and starting to get noticed. SBE has been up almost 40% this week. The merger is expected to close before the end of Q4. I currently have 93 share @ average cost of $18.29 and $30c Exp. 2/19/21.

I hear what you're saying. But the world cannot handle an economy crash, it's just impossible in this day and age. Maybe we could use some old notions to track the future, it's just economy is being defined as we're living now. We've already survived the slope and we were expecting  a crash at 240, 260, 280, 300, 330, 340, 350... I think it's a distant memory that crash will occur and we're probably about to see 400 soon because COVID might have gave everyone a lesson that the world could literally  stop functioning in a day so YOLO. Anyways no one knows, yet to be seen..

US has no EV market except California
Great, thanks. Few more questions: why was there such a massive sell-off? Almost 70% of float held by institutions so how comes its being kept so low? And lastly the $1 billion share buyback should increase share price, no?

Bill Ackman is bullish on stocks for 2021, but has a hedge position for a ‘tragic’ end to 2020

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who made big money betting against the markets earlier this year, said he’s optimistic about a recovery in 2021, but investors will need to get through a “tragic” year-end first.
I bought 100 at 9.92. So I already did...

Do think cutting your flowers to water your weeds applies to options? 

I have Z, FB and BABA calls and when one is up big I sell it and buy more of the one that's down. EX) sold 1 Z110 to buy 3 FB300. Trading back and forth I've added like 20% more contracts by doing this. I believe all of them will be in the money by expiration so I feel confident in it. Anyone else do this too?

How can you just write off the vaccine news as fumes.  We have two vaccines that are 95% effective and will be out in the spring to at least the high risk people.  We may have 4 or 5 effective vaccines by spring too.  It's basically one more quarter of shit earnings away and then we're opening back up with so much $$$liquidity on the sidelines.

So is DKNG dead - or still a meme?
When I was a wee retard about 25 years ago my parents didn't know shit about investing or managing their money. Someone at my mom's job got them all talking about investing in real estate, and brought up this big empty amount of land in the state. They were talking about all throwing their money in and how someone who knew someone said it was going to blow up and get quickly developed.

So my parents drop around $60k into a plot of land, without ever having laid eyes on it.

Two years after their investment, we drive out to it. It's what you'd expect--a small road through overgrown woods. On the way back we cross over a small bridge that crosses over a canal, and I look out the window.

There's a fucking nuclear power plant not 5 miles away.

To this day, the best offer they got was around $15k from the power company who wanted to build pylons on the plot. They're holding it still. They're in their 70s now.

Retard investing is multigenerational I guess

Cute all lil bitch ain’t it?
The open interest in 11/20 92.50C is hilarious

After looking at some of the charts with those random jumps, I wonder if they were all bull traps either for tomorrow (Opex) or next week.
Gonna buy 3000 shares just to fuck with you

I'm still standing. TSLA is ''only'' at PE 1000 since today. I'm sure bulls can pump it up to PE 10 000 and I'll still dump money shorting it. Even more money :)

Your funds will be SETTLED in T(trade date) + 2 days....or THURSDAY. Now, you can daytrade on Tuesday or Wednesday if you want...UNTIL you have done it 3x with unsettled funds in 12 months which if you do you will then proceed to get a good faith violation which you will have for 90 days.

I guess it makes sense, the securitization of mortgages into MBS got firmly pinned on Wall Street banks in '08 - now it's just RKT and every other non-financial originating
No one is gonna have a chance with the bots until they start selling them in stores and having a 1 per customer limit enforced in person

I mean, (38)% is more than a crash. Sure it recovered for the indexes thanks to a handful of companies, but most in that value bucket still having recovered.

Get back to me when Nvidia cards can run it properly in Minecraft and I'll buy into ray tracing. Until then I've seen too many of Nvidia's gimmicks get laid to the side by game devs to care.

My parents are about fifty years older than me too. My mom is from the war-torn country of Philadephia, and my father is from the Soviet Bloc country called New York City. They both stopped attending school after finishing their post-graduate degrees.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that they are both brilliant people, and were I an actually dutiful son, I would go after everything they know with a goddamn spoon. I am incredibly fortunate to be their kid, and it makes me sad to know that other people won't have the same opportunities that that affords. But, once I start making ultra-phat PhD-in-Machine-Learning bucks, I'm gonna be donating plenty.

I love Fridays like this
1.) the timing has been building to this point for a long time.  Seriously, these ducks want to make money, they could probably get a better deal with trump than Biden.  They would want to pimp it for cash it ASAP (which I assume that motivation surpasses all moral or political motivations) 


2.) In most of the announcements, I saw PFE state it was greater than 90% effective.  90% is a hell of a good number for vaccine.  They probably thought that was a really impressive number (it is).  Also, they probably figured that if they said it was “97% effective” but then the real/final numbers came in at 95% effective, the media would crucify them.  All the media & conspiracy theorists & anti-Vaxers would never shut up about how they “over stated effectiveness” and “lied about protection” blah blah blah.  So it’s reasonable to assume they understated their original numbers by a tad (they weren’t final yet). 



3.) It’s easy to manipulate small changes in numbers.  I’m an expert in pharmaceutical & medical trial protocols.  You can’t change your core measures, or end outcomes, or initial exclusion/inclusion criteria without huge blowback from the community. But you can tweak or alter subtle standards to make the final results more (or less) confident. 



4.) It’s not crazy that mRNA is all happening at the same time- it’s obviously not a preferred method (have you seen the storage requirements?!).  But it’s easier to mass produce faster.  This vaccine is both very urgent in terms of health, and in terms of the money tied to it (if 50% of people have had covid by the time it’s released, they could lose 50% of their market).  So they would rather lose doses and/or effectiveness based on the logistic issues than be second to market or too late to the pandemic


5.) Do I think PFE & Moderna told their nerds to find new ways to interpret the data to beat each other? Hell yes.  
Does (90 vs 95 vs 94.5%) make a clinical difference? Probably not when you account for real world scenarios.
BA fucking die
hmm tsla veggies...

Why do you think this? Thursdays have been weekly highs.

pretty much all of that was before open. another thing this sub has ruined me in is making me feel like if my stock isn’t jumping 10%+ a day i’m missing out on one that is
That looks pretty interesting and you're right, I wouldn't expect anything more than borrowed results from stochastic calculus. In my course we also didn't have to do any proofs, we mostly did Monte Carlo simulation for options pricing.

yea. the economy is good for the economy, policy will effect it obviously but we're gonna keep chugging.

I have a problem with the progressive left's solution to many of our current economic problems impacting markets, such as wealth inequality.

I dont know what the solution is, but I hoenstly think people like AOC are idiots when explaining the solutions to these issues (and it shows, not a single bill she had got passed) . Its such a nuanced thing. but what do i know... i like she points out the problem though. but you can really tell she doesnt know what shes talking about when it comes to solutions.

power hour lets go
Do you think with the Georgia runoff happening soon Pelosi might agree to Mitch’s terms on this stimulus deal? Like idk maybe the thought process is that if the dems wait for the runoff and still lose, all of the time in between will have been wasted.

Same on 15P 12/31, keep on holding on buddy
what does that mean? first stage?
I agree with this analysis. My first trip to China was about 7 years ago. Local branded cars were very basic and with terrible designs. Recently they have some really competitive cars. Rafik Ferrag the lead designer is French and has worked at PSA and Honda. Xpeng are not scared to admit that automotive talent doesn’t always have to come from within China. 

With a huge market on their doorstep, these companies don’t have to worry too much about exports to succeed. One thing is quite certain, once the government realise there are enough home grown EV manufacturers within China, they will ramp up the restrictions on ICE vehicles sharply in order to kill the competition.

If you believe this stock is going to jump to $45 EOY, youre nuts. While rocket is a good company, they haven't proven themselves in the investing world. This stock is cyclical and dependant on multiple factors, all of which could go to shit whenever the FED makes a move or a bubble bursts. Rocket is making the correct moves into auto loans, but yet again, that's even a bigger competitor market and not sure how they'll compete.

Great company, not so great stock. It will grow, but at a slow rate. The real company to buy into if we're speaking of mortgage loans is United Shore, whenever they make the IPO happen.

PEIX actually seems solid after its crash.  They switched some manufacturing around to be more competitive now that ethanol has tanked and they’ve announced that they’ve basically run out of space to sign new contracts in 2021 because of demand.

@op this analysis seems pretty spot on, however, i believe it’s dependent on Biden not being able to pass a multi trillion stimulus bill, and the moderna and Pfizer vaccines not being implemented in the next few months.  If one or both of these things happen, the market should avoid a crash.

Low volume pump means sour hour is upon you.
All 4 will print. Wait and see.
The current recession was able to be determined by many factors including the inverted yield rates becoming displaced on Treasury Bonds short term interest rates more preferable than long term rates, one of thousands of complex indications of the financial markets entering a recession. At this point in time FFRs for banks are going to be reduced in the long term even turning negative as some economist warn uncertainty is only going to grow, not nearly as bad as feb-march collapse, i believe you entered this position too early, as Q4 is not only the last stand for nearly all market sectors to move i expect new record highs before hitting record lows you have placed a lot of DD on legitimately reasonable data, but failed to understand a reason or rhyme with this market in general is not there you will open up that positions door to find yourself with a margin call i doubt you have the will commitment or diamond hands to hold that position for two weeks.

The offering that everyone with puts was cheering about was to close out debt and is priced at 17.59.  

So basically they are saying if you give up 6% guaranteed interest bonds you can have shares at 17.59.  

If bond holders accept it, there is dilution yes, but the trade off is less debt and more importantly less interest on the debt.  

Dilution for cash is really bad, dilution to pay off debt isn’t the same.

no way you thought he meant rn that’s so fucking autistic lmao
wait for the mandatory vacs and fines/jail if you do not comply

Nothing wrong with buy and hold if that is your strategy. I've learned too much about markets and options to settle for <10% a year, and the market is not that hard to time.

It’s usually more beneficial to not throw your emotions on the table when unprompted. That’s the joke. 

Also, as your two assumptions about me seem to clash against each other - that I’m both doing well from Biden winning, and simultaneously in a position where I need the govt to sponsor me, I’ll clarify that I’m doing, frankly, great financially. Since before corona.

Just because I didn’t vote for “flood the markets with QE” Trump, doesn’t mean I’m a total degenerate :) it also doesn’t mean I voted for Biden

NIO won’t stay down holy cow
So check this out. As some of you know, I got distracted and made the dumb mistake of purchasing Dunkn' Donuts instead of DraftKings (DNKN vs DKNG) this morning. So I started looking into what was going on with Dunkn' Donuts ever since the proposed takeover/buyout at $106 by Inspire Brands. Turns out lawsuits have been filed questioning whether the consideration and the process that led to the deal are adequate, or whether the consideration undervalues the Company. 

In short, there is a chance this deal may fall through. And guess what? $110 calls even 1 or 2 years out are dirt cheap...like a nickel or a dime. 

From the looks of it, this deal closing out is already delayed and even a small issue could send this to the toilet meaning DNKN can continue its already meteoric rise well above its current $106 plateau in the coming months.

I dunno, but those cheap call options seem like a nice bet right now. Let me know if you think I'm crazy.

Happy trading.
NIO $69 BY JANUARY

That makes sense, if this gets moved I'll probably start taking my autism there or to ThetaGang.  Thought it couldn't hurt to post this here.  Figured RKT is a "meme" stock.  Will consider in future though, and thanks for not being an ass hole, it is appreciated (although probably warranted).

I'm not doing much the next few days, off through Thanksgiving.  Will look into horizontal comparisons of RKT to other lenders to include banks and non banks.  Not included in the DD is the dramatic shift from banks as originators and holders of mortgages to non financial institutions.

TSLA 480C 1/15/21 up 30% so far, ride it to valhalla or roll it into a 520c?

Double top on GME, get ready to pull back
They will print don’t worry
Already in
I like XPEV long term over the others because they are actually making their own cars in their own factories which they have built in record time, spend about 40% of budget Into R&D, and as you can see are making nicer level cars (P7) as well as introducing a mass market car. Compared to just (literally) stealing tesla's tech, they look like they are trying to copy the formula for what makes tesla so strong In the largest EV market in the world. With gov backing no less
nothing except for the fact I'm 1k poorer
AAPL is a savings account now. Don't buy in hopes that it will move anymore fast.
Not unless you're a holder of the company that is being acquired. But since ChargePoint is not listed for public trading, until the merging, so there's nothing to worry about.
You sweatin
Good shit, look at my post history, I did the same too. It's always good to gamble your money on advice from strangers
WTF is invest? I only Gamble
70% down on Jan 300c...don't think I'm gonna break even on it
SPY going to open tomorrow at 360, ramp to 363 and close 360. This is the way to kill VIX to sub 20 finally.
I actually think its more likely people will buy TSLA stock with their stimmy which is even more bullish lol
AYRO is up 50% today. No news. No headway. It’s completely fucked and I know I’m going to kick myself later for not selling.
Ya but we went downsie for many reasons
Sorry I forgot what sub I'm in
Thinking about getting real shares in SRAC
Let this be a lesson to the gay bears and the doubters. Good things come to those who buy NIO and fucking hold

Your biological mom or your "Mom (the other one)" mom?
Damn get well soon!
Sure, but you’re forgetting record unemployment and no stimulus — you have significantly less consumers along with less shopping in cities with lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.  

Spy is pumping so people don’t freak out, but it’s nowhere near reality.
thats too bad. Git gud? idk im up 3k. It feels super predictable honestly.
Just bought FD spy calls 11/20 359 hold me
Do you apply the 60 day rule to all your 6mo+ out calls?

I’m so pissed I didn’t load up on SE and SQ yesterday. Thought today would be red too. That’s what I get for being a bear I guess.
float is still huge. also we're just breaking resistance of 500 after 3 months so expect for more shorts to get burned and new ath before dec 18
I guess it's AMD's turn
:( was this morning lol...
Not my thing either.  But it's pretty much the opposite of buying shares low and selling high, but most people don't necessarily dump shares at a loss if they plan on holding long anyway.
I'm in 🚀🚀🚀 TO THE MOON
lockdowns are bullish, means another stimmy and more robinhood liquidity
Vaccine hopes are all used up.

Rotation back to stimulus hopes.
Its okay. NIO was shit back then. Hindsight 20/20. But you fucked up.
Lol
This post explains why I am right and then ends by saying "you are wrong." It's bizarre.

\> Suppose we buy £1 million of government bonds from a pension fund. In place of the bonds, the pension fund now has £1 million in money.

This is incorrect, the fund now has reserves.

\> Money has entered the real economy in the shape of unemployment protection payments and direct stimulus checks. 

That is fiscal policy, not fed policy, and has nothing to do with QE.
1/15/21 C $310
crystal ball says $23.74
CIIC is gonna fly again tomorrow. Come on over to Arrival
this market 😂 yesterday we opened green and ended red, today the opposite, when literally nothing changed 🤡
Is PLNT a soy based software program?
market manipulation is so gd obvious. Any hint of the market going down we get VACCINE 90% EFFECTIVE. Then VACCINE 95% EFFECTIVE! then OH OUR VACCINE IS NOW 95% EFFECTIVE TOO!. Then, "were running out of vaccine news" OH STIMULUS TALKS BACK ON THE TABLE!!
All depends on next weeks unemployment numbers. See if this week's increase was a precursor or if it was just a random jump
In my opinion, OPs scenario will kick in, if vaccine trials are unsuccessful or rejected by FDA. Market will then turn to shit. If successful/approved: 🚀 
So he is correct, that we will now in 4-6 weeks...
Might as well speak spanish
pump LI now thank you
Hod? Sorry I'm a retard
So when my homie kamala gonna talk about weed stocks on BET?

stim talks resuming
You’re very close. But I’m only down 40%...
It isn’t called s&p 500 for no reason.
Retard buyers
Stimulus is very bullish for TSLA, people will buy Teslas with their stimulus checks.
I unironically was looking at BABA. May follow through on it.
Baba 🚀
Not looking good we’ll see during power hour. That said I have 3 500c 1/15 which will be fine. Good luck!

I think I'll get some 12/18 Spy puts here and close my eyes until after Thanksgiving
I second the mango man dumping the market. If not, then I see retail following the green ship into the close and then MM crushing every option in existence tomorrow for OpEx.

Perfect Setup. Didn’t shake me out of my VXX hedge. If neither happen, will go with trend an average down insurance hedge. GL.

Nvm.
Yeah I was told that I was virtually immune for at least 12 weeks.  Had it like 8 weeks ago.  Few symptoms then.

I'm hearing that if you are asymptomatic the first time, then you may not have built up much immunity.  This time there are more symptoms for sure.
Stocks only go up

Why we going up, again?

Since May I went from up 20k to up 60k and now down to up 30k  -- options are addictive once I started them. Am taking a breather for the next few days and plan to spend some of these gains over the weekend to actually enjoy before I take any more risk....lots of lessons learned. Always take profit.
further lock downs.... only dropped us 1.5%... too much money don't go short long term
With shares boi
Did yours sell right away? I wonder who’s buying this tbh
i did the same thing.  bought back in tho

Ahhhhh.  I remember when back to back 3%+ movement called for celebration.  


Now we’re used to 5-10% days and constant rocket ships.
It looks like the floor on this is higher than I'd expected, so holding for now. Will sell if it pumps hard again and rebuy on the inevitable dip. I don't see this mooning until they start to roll out their EV tech next year, unless there's some major news.

gme 1/15/21 c - yolo

ebay $60 1/15/21 c - 3 month all time low, easy holiday seasons money

niu 12/18 c - ev scooters, more popular in eastern countries & metropolitan areas. hasn't super boomed yet like nio. also close to niu. earnings report soon, going to crush. we can see their daily active riders which ties heavily to sales and its looking good for the earnings report

pfe 12/18 c - people sold off from moderna news, so i bought some calls because they're gonna be buying vaccines from every company to meet demand for 8 billion people. both are 95%+ effective, though moderna can store in normal fridge temps
290c is nowhere near degenerate enough to be called an FD foh
Weeellll, thank you for bringing this stonk to my attention 😁
Stim might be back on the table because the F***ING economy is supposed to be in shambles. Turns out the only thing in shambles are my puts.

It happens every several years. Think mobile computing (Apple/Google) back in late 2000s, semiconductors/payments in mid 2010s. Ecommerce wins of today (Amazon/SHOP/etc...) are a culmination of a decade of work and investment by those companies + suddenly favorable environment where their competitors got destroyed. What's next?
Well, I’m out for today.  I had some SQQQ calls, but this market makes no damn sense.  Mass lockdowns, pandemic, record unemployment, and spy pumps.
it's not EOD yet
Wasnt there something like quadruple witching back in Sept? We went downsie?

Not being  a dick - before you loose bunch of money, just do a 10 min research on SPAC.
It's bound to hit pre-citron highs sooner or later, may reject it but I know shareholders are curious enough to hold to at least $50. Should be natural resistance there.
“accidentally”
You cracked the SPY run you win!
Most bears are probably dead at this point. Whoever is still short is just insane lol. Were at ath doubt many shorts are still holding out here.
Positions?
Yeah holding until then, then I’ll sell some to for taxes.
Going to talk about talking about stimulus again. Feels like a done deal to me gonna go ahead and spend that $1200.

If I had $13c I’d think about diamond hands but I need a 20% day just to break even and a 15% to expire ITM with my $15c
Big balls
PLTR lookin strong as shit this week
I hold both, to the moon!
So you know how you sell puts at a loss?  They shorted actually shares. So they borrowed shares to sell and were expecting to buy back cheaper to profit.  But if it doesn’t go lower they need to buy back at a higher price at a loss creating more buying driving the price up.  Can’t sit by and watch the price keep going up without buying them back or else it’s just a larger loss. So a squeeze sometimes happens quick when a fuckload of shorts have to be covered.
I've been so uncertain on any plays
Cry yourself to sleep knowing it was only 2 contracts bro
Brick and mortar hard copy game stores are the future
We are going to get good vaccine news AMC. EUA for PFE or some shit.
Quick give me a play. Gonna close my cash secured NIO puts I wrote so I’ll have 4.5k in capital freed up to yolo
Lmao yeah I just woke up missed almost all the trading day don’t mind me
Same boat here. Except I went all in. Nothing left to purchase puts
Wow
Dontchu know pump it upppp

Wtf happening to spy?
Love the company, 80-90 eoy ATLEAST
How is +5% flat you fucking idiot? Sure it's not mooning as much as XPeng...but still.
What news did this? Reopening mooning
I know the market is supposed to be forward looking but holy fuck how far are we looking
Did we just bomb Corona? America #1
Bought BLNK 12/18 yesterday and 1/15 today, sold some calls today for guaranteed profit. Cant decide if I want to sell more now or risk holding until tomorrow/next week
dont stop QQQ, lol bought some 290FDs rofl.. printing 100%
You made me do the same with the 5k I’m not YOLOing on NIO
**BABA IS BACK HAHAHA DUCK YOU WINNIE THE POOH**
Volume on NIO and TSLA is insane 🚀🚀
Cause someone posted a bear DD post and it hit the front page.
Why bynd
It's your choice. ITM = Less free money vs. OTM = More free money.
I too want these things
Buy any option that is OP (i.e 10 call on a 10.65 stock for .64)

Sell far far otm calls

Sell puts on spy

Don’t ever buy a weekly option

Don’t go short over a long term
Because it pumped this early it’s gonna be a blood bath near market close with profit taking
Huge TSLA squeeze tomorrow?
imagine selling for a lost because u listened to the gay bear andrew.
Like shit sometimes. 10% is my max, but the positions need to speak to me. So I'm usually on LSD.
I hate that I’m an adult gambling on GME, HYLN, RUN and more. What happened to my life?!?
Buy right before it crashes, sell at the first hint of an upturn, right before it moons.

^seriously.
I'm only going to say this one more time, CVS is going to make a bigly announcement before the end of the month. This is your last chance to get in
The printer always goes brrrr. don't know what the fuck you going on about
ZM really fucking me.
Chadsdaq bout to bust through 12 again
Do you think Palantir knows if you own shares so in their spy database they flag you as cool? Or is it gamefied like this dude owns one way OTM call so he's alright, this dude owns puts so he's a terrorist, this dude YOLO'd his life savings so he's super cool...
This shit spiking cause Schumer said COVID talks back on the table. 

Spoiler: they aren't but any BS will pump
BULLISH

I had 120 bitcoins in 2012.

I found a facebook status of mine, laughing at the time I sold 20 bitcoins to someone in a starbucks through localbitcoins.com for a total of $250.
It’s got better numbers in China. Not as scaleable as NIO, but solid Chinese EV with proven sales
7000% shorted
FUCK TESLA OMG
Buy low and sell low. Double negative equals a positive.
We’re due for an orange man tweet that ruins everything soon
I literally sold SOLO to get RIDE calls yesterday 🤡🤡🤡
Pump me baby 💦💦💦
thanks for saying this. i was getting worried.
Everyone: There's no way the market can keep going up with the world on fire

Stonks: WITNESSSSS MEEEEEE
money controls the mind so easily its scary
LMAO but actually tho
Earlier this week picked up PLTR Feb 19 $24 calls and a Jan 2022 $30 call on a dip. LETS GO Tendies are on the menu
Bears r so fuk
Stock markets in turmoil!!!
So when the fuck is the 20% tank happening? Oh wait, you have no fucking idea. Have fun selling all your shit right now, especially when half the market is still in the dumps. 

You are basically outing yourself as a retard who only pays attention to meme stocks and tech by saying “market is overvalued”
I'll make it simple for your little retard brain. 
1. Stonks only go up
2. Printer go brrrr
3. Only buy options on stocks already up 20%
I love these pumps, they just blew my asshole out
XEL is free money at this level
I don't understand it. I'm dumb sure, but it's really fucking weird.
2:30pm pump is the new 2:30am pump
80 mins, no?
Rug pull incoming
My SNAP calls are up 134%, but I can't sell then because of PDT restrictions... Wonder if I should by puts to hedge them.

Monday its coming

Mom boyfriend told me
good plan, thanks
Ok boomer..

Might be good play with new consoles coming out.
Spy is the most complicated thing ever
why is that?
No, I suppose it doesn't.
What changed? What made the market go from hover to massive green dildo? I am searching all the news stations and can't find diddly shit.
I have a few 13c 11/20 that I paid .41 for. Diamond handing this bitch for sure.
Yo
Investors lookin into it since they’re going EV now
I'm going to laugh all the way to the bank if my SPY 11/20 $360 calls don't expire worthless tomorrow.
Ive been rolling a few SPY puts a month out

Every monday i sell it at a loss and update it to a different price, and put the expiration date a week further out. 

Today i sold at the bottom and bought 1DTE calls with the profits

Gonna ride it to 360, sell them, and reopen a month out put

Easy money with good timing, and the advantage of holding a monthly put is when the inevitable crash finally happens im going to tendie town
Could help but notice the Kodak hat. Probably still sore from the beating he took on that one
LOL HAHHA FUCK so much volume and not even EOD hahhah fuck RIP Bears
TSLA 515 EOD
I sold SOLO to get RIDE calls yesterday 🤡🤡🤡
oh theres no uncertainty. we bout to be in lockdown boi.
instead of selling calls for SOLO i could have bought instead and would have been 100% profit , now loss 100%

Damn huuge qqq order for feb😳
lmfao
WHAT HAVE I BEEN SAYING!!!! Rocket into close 🚀🚀🚀
I think once the stimulus comes out people freak out over money printing and load up on metals. Also used in solar roofs so bullish for the upcoming years. Idk if that info is useful for the weekly call people lol.
[removed]
IMAGINE IF BUFFET ACTUALLY WASN'T INVESTING INTO TESLA BUT RATHER PLTR... THE TENDIES
Aye. Either case is bullish. Too much uncertainty is gone now. We slow grind up nows.
that's why he has to sell his house to buy puts he has no cash left
Bull traps 100%
not too familiar with etsy pre and post being added but tsla up 22% in 3 days.
I warn u one more time get some FISV calls dingbats.  

FISV 105c 1/21
Hey I got a tip that the 5 major companies that control 90% of the cardboard market is announcing a $50/ton increase on liner and medium (main components in boxes). Supposedly official in Pulp and Paper tomorrow afternoon. 

Not sure how this will effect $ip but just a hot tip
Bank reserves aren’t only used to lend against. Reserves for example, are also used to settle transactions between fed member banks.

Also, when the fed credits a bank’s reserves, they aren’t stuck there, as maybe it’s unintentionally implied by OP. Banks in the US are generally subject to a reserve ratio requirement. That requirement is currently zero, like most of the world. 

Banks will still keep reserves for multiple purposes, as reserves aren’t subject to strict capital requirements like other assets, but it’s wrong to assume that when the fed credits a bank’s reserve account that money is stuck there. 

Also, give that Bank of England article a read. That is how money is created, as opposed to the Econ 101 version of the money multiplier with reserves.
I think I will inverse you, NotGucci
Thanks for clarifying. What I meant
CCL 16.5P 11/27
Sold my SPY 360c like an idiot this morning. Bought a 354p expiring tomorrow

Serious question, how do you guys gamble more than like 5% of your portfolio on FDs? How do you sleep at night?
Is there a reason SPY is just going vertical

Pump me daddy!
As of 10/31/2020. Does that not even include the massive gains from this week?
How the fuck could there be any bears left. They broke snd can’t even be bear anymore
Hey man you got anything to say today?? Oh wait me and my tendies are too busy fucking your mom, give me a minute. Don’t worry daddy has your allowance right next to my fucking Tesla #Nerd
Power hour gonna be up bigly over this fail Guilliani coup
I made $20K in March which is a lot of money for me. I withdrew $15,000 and haven’t touched it since.

Last year I made $10,000 on AMD and lost every dollar of it overnight....not to mention TLRY was one of my first trades ever like three years ago and i lost thousands to them lol. So i learned my lesson

I’ve already missed out on $2500 today with Tesla but whatever. I keep turning like $250 into $2500 dollars every month
If someone has a short, and the short doesn’t work out by the date that it expires the person who owns a short has to buy shares of the stock to cover for the short, so when there’s a ton of shorts and the stock doesn’t fall, you get a short squeeze when a large quantity of shares has to be bought, and that’ll drive a stocks price up.


At least that’s my understanding of it, could be completely wrong cause I’m retarded who knows
His real middle name is unreadable to humans. All hail our God-Emperor.
Smells like a rug pull incoming
It’s very unlikely that “Buffett” is buying TSLA but as he and Munger have more or less handed off the reins, it’s possible that BRK is buying
I open robinhood so much that I recognize each stock not by the ticker but by the shape of its mini price chart
Wow that is a pump
great question
good bot
Patience. Not the time to buy yet
No one cares what George Soros has to say, ur lament about buying doesn’t mean shit to me
really, ugh
It’s when shorts cover !!
I'm buying another 20k in Dec 18 spy puts. On sale rn
Might’ve just bottomed. Might go to $21. It’s a bitch to trade.
Yes daddy SPY, I love it when you rip my face off!
I don’t even understand
man gains really start picking up the pace when your portfolio crosses 100k. 

Every 1% gain is a grand. 

200k is going to come a shit ton faster than I thought.
Spy is at .4% u donut
I don't think TSLA is going run-up to close.
TTCF is a great company and is competitively valued compared to BYND and others in the industry.  Good call!
SHOP time, WFH comeback, at least thru Jan.
If Cohen buys, GameStop will thrive long term. He wants to switch them to more tech based. He will do the same thing he did with Chewy. GameStop has a lot of potential, just current management isn’t taking advantage of it
CVS go vertical baby
Contemplating whether I should sell my 11/20 47c before close today
Lmao wtf is going on, is some hedge fund manager stroking out n clicking buttons.
[deleted]
Oh so they're selling short shares, as opposed to Puts
How about looking at the stocks PE ratio compared to other financing institutions that are publically traded? Looking at PE and it’a EPS... shows it’s severely undervalued at this current price.
Never too late. It's actually a good company. There's a lot of pump and dumps recently but PLTR isn't one of them.
I'm in VXX long term, but not sure if it's worth the theta burn. It's pretty much insurance
I like your style. Sounds fun let’s do it
How much less fun is tsla going to be once it’s in the sp500?
More then we should, lol
Just waiting for Nio to hit $55 so I can cash these calls out pls
Oops wrong thread
not enough to make a regular stock move. maybe a penny stock lol

Not enough to move the market unless it’s small cap
You ever try and explain this sub to someone IRL? They could never understand....

Now I have to call my therapist again. Thanks asshole
No I like making money
PLTR CRSR 50 EOD BABA 300 EOM PLEASE
Why is GME running up?
They have a huge online catalog.
Thats when monthly options expire. Sometimes we go big uppies sometimes big downies sometime very flatsies
LOL. I am a weak man. Sold it at 105.5 this morning. It was an easy trading day for 10 minutes of fluctuations. Now bought back in at 104.44 again.
LOL SPY vertical rofl... 360 EOD
No one knows its confidential in the filing so its all speculation
how would I have money if I was always bearish
[deleted]
cuz market is autistic
We are the stock market 😎
so like how much volume does WSB actually influence, is there actual data on this
Is there going to be a rug pull like yesterday?
Sometimes I feel like a true degenerate being on this sub so much. But then I remember that there’s a sub called r/girlfartstories and there’s currently 60 dudes on there jacking off to stories of girls farting in their face. I feel better about myself
Whatcha selling?
Gewd my calls need it. About -85% on leaps, going to need Apple at like 140 by December lol
My dream is to make it big like you and retire to barbados
This is the way
And yet half the retards on Reddit were busy selling all their stocks on March 20th because “we have a long way down”
Jan 21 2022 2.5C, bought for 1.75
full meme market
So. why we pumping?
357p anyone?
R8 ?
They are literally at the end of the post. Are you people blind?
Like you got enough money to push the stock upwards?
I love Albertsons (ACI).  Nice and steady gains, no stress.
Buffet buying into tesla?  Heard about this? Anyone know?
Fuck your asshole... I may lose 90% of my portfolio but you better believe at least one of these puts will print. You also better believe it will be $NIO
I was kind of in a different world in March. I was up 120k then just literally gambled it down to 45k. It just set in how much I could fucking use that 75k right now lol
lol, glad I didn't make that mistake. SOLO was the move yesterday.
Aren’t you always bearish?
Nasdaq going up because we're staying at home. IWM and SPY going up because we have a vaccine. Bears think they're still hunting velociraptor bulls, but the truth is they've been surrounded with nowhere to run.
Xpev market cap lower than nio
He cant sell till March 2021
PLTR i'm gonna coooom
She doesnt have a basement cuz she lives in an apartment building. Why are you lying?
Until the dip happens
ITS MEME TIME! GME GME!  PLTR!  XPEV!
I bought 50 in 2011 for $6 each.  I sold 30 at 18k the last time it popped and started to decline. Can't decide whether to dump and be done with the scam or hold them forever lol
As a Tesla call holder, I’m genuinely baffled at how Tesla can keep going up
FOMO for retards that didnt load up on the 2.5 days of red
Not RIDE because I bought in
My puts are down but the ridiculous OTM call hedges more than paid for it lmao fucking Macy's
I was gonna jump in but I couldn't find the calls button...
I’ve looked at NIO every day since it was $26 and said “it’s too expensive” and every day I wake up and regret not buying the day prior.
ur about 2 months late
There will be a short term down trend as people begin to realize vaxx won't force people to fly

Yea, they can be used as collateral for loans. But they are not lending right now, hence it’s essentially dead money
How much higher you think it’ll go? 800MM market cap with almost 7 bil revenue (but negative EPS)
people complaining about losing money on PLTR when it’s $0.50 away from ATH yesterday = 🤡
I just bought a few GME puts. I’m stupid
Thoughts on SLV?
PLTR going to 20 by end of Friday
Alright fuck it. Yolo pltr
That shit has been flat for weeks. It’s gonna take a miracle
Just go up please
I'm literally starting to think this is the way
🤔hmmm🤔 different pattern today for PLTR bullish I guess 🤔
2 days old
Ah that moment when an autist gets asked a question they can’t answer.
Ok I'll try to sell one of my kidneys. I should have two of them, right?
went in for a few hundred GME shares, gotta contribute to the squeeze
At least I put in the work to fix his mistake.
If you borrow shares you have to "return" them by buying them back eventually
Free money bby!
Just curious man, how the fuck did you know about NIO back then
The last 6 months have been the greatest market for mortgages in the history of our country.  RKT has had two different earnings calls with great results yet the stock hasn't moved.  

This will never moon or shoot up.  Sorry but the market has spoken pretty strongly about this one.
Buy when there's 2-page bear DD on the front of WSB

Sell when said bear goes bankrupt

Oh I’m good. Bought BABA and NIO because Biden won. Watch the money printer sizzle and explode if his finger gets anywhere near it. Congrats on your candidate winning. I hope he fixes all of your problems for free!!
Anyone think Naked Brand (NAKD) will go back up now that they've settled the whole minimum stock fiasco?

Very well could be. And unless you think 70% in a week isnt the end of the pump, you know what comes next
Buy back in

Can someone explain to a retard what OPEX is and why we will moon because of it?
Short squeeze to 16-18
qqq calls back on the menu?
TSLA LETS FUCKING GO
Like 95% of people shit talking the stock are number 3. Just jelly they can't have the kind of gains wsb gets.
Don’t miss buying into AIRLINES folks!  Pricing in COVID vax now!  Don’t miss the boat this time!
trading my calls for shares at 30, would exit shares at 60
I mean, any tsla bull play is good, I'm just afraid he'll do like most the retards here and hold until exp. But yea, at some point between now and then that play should be in the green.
Not just any boats. They're making gaming boats with GME, CORSAIR, NVIDIA. All the techs. So QQQ and hardware.
Already up 41% 😌 holding till my portfolio is back to where it was
Half this sub says get your outs ready for EOD, and the other half says get your calls in. Wtf 😂
the only thing is I don't see GME being a gradual squeeze like OSTK so I feel like the squeeze will be more like VW because people still have no faith that GME will survive in the long run and will sell of within a week so to me that caps the potential of the squeeze, but the short float being as high as it is may give it a better chance at the insane numbers so truly no one knows what the potential is.
MSFT breaking out 🚀
Alright I never have played SPACs, after the merger will the ticker symbol SBE still remain the same ? And SBE will then operate ChargePoint?
95% is very optimistic lmao

It really is
Don't have the time to read it all right now, but in essence I agree. I think we have another few good week before the lockdowns and increased covid cases wreck us. No one seems to be taking it seriously

I plan on liquidating a lot of my assets next week and going more conservative stocks and VXX calls
Bought some amd 90$ expiring tomorrow let’s pray
What an original thesis, brb selling all my stocks because some dude on the internet predicted a market crash.
*Another* EV startup? Geez. Seems like we see a new symbol pop up every day.
I feel like December/January is going to be a bloodbath as we hit new infection, hospitalization, and death highs (everyone breaking quarantine because yolo it's all going to be over soon anyway). Plus students coming home from college tracking disease everywhere. Add on to that this Christmas season being a trainwreck due to minimal in-person shopping and impulse overbuying, nobody having money, and massive eviction/default rates on the horizon. Oh yeah, we also have a possible government shutdown looming in early December, and who knows if the current administration will even care about keeping the doors open.
But how will I know what to buy puts on? 😥

They never learn. Spy calls are free money right now we will be trading above $360 next week
That price is ridiculous
AAL is in that range. 1000 won't be much in the world of CSPs though
My 590c 12/11 is printing
The banks can absolutely use reserves above the minimum reserve for lending purposes. They are called excess reserves. So if the FED adds to a bank’s reserves that will increase the excess reserves (unless the bank hasn’t met the minimum requirement which is unlikely). Right now they are just choosing not to lend because who would want to be exposed to commercial real estate right now lol.

The argument that the FED doesn’t print money because it pays in reserves is misleading.
does power hr pump more rofl?
Ball crushing pump inbound
guys luckily I figured it out, the market is stupid, I bought calls in the morning LOOOOOL JUST DO WHAT SHOULDNT WORK AND YOULL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION SPY 370 0DTE

Why are you saying it's free money?
Just need one price upgrade for PLTR. 🎲
CNBC: Minimum wage hike coming?

Market will overreact to any hike. It's $7.25 in my state, yet all fast food in my area offers $11.50+ starting pay
Instead of buying puts, you should be buying shit that would benefit from rotation (TLT and GLD).

There really isn't enough data to say that for certainty regarding the vaccines though is there?  Still really new and haven't had any full general population studies done.

24% gains aren't bad

I've looked up short squeeze a hundred times i dont get how covering by liquidating works
I feel like TSLA is a pretty good coin flip, sitting at the bottom of a rising channel
And CIIC and VFF and PSTH please
Just from the sound that wall makes, I can tell its not diamond hands hitting a concrete support wall.
heh
I still can’t believe how badly Sears fucked up
To the autists who told me not to buy MSFT calls today thank you... I went with BABA instead... Jack Ma make printer go BRRRRRR

LOL long GME :) free money
I'd grab ZM, the worst of the vaccine news has hit (only JNJ left) and it appears sentiment is leaning towards lockdowns

For winners try setting stop limit and letting it ride. Either way no risk on the profit downside
The fed doesn't set inflation. That is determined by credit lending AKA the banks.

tesla 2000$ by end of next year.  It's not just a car company, they also sell sexy short short. 

those that doubts Elon deserve to lose money.
Hope you didn’t sell and are still holding that shit
GME always rips on a thursday. I should just start buying calls every wednesday.
I'm thinking $46
No. There’s a 50% chance it will go down
Low volume, only people left buying this shit are you guys
Are we talking 2 or 3 days for the long term hold?

Are you for real? Do you realize what's going on with EV stocks right now?

This isn't gain porn, it's sad. Because it's nothing compared to what other EV stocks are doing. 

Here's some gain porn for today: https://imgur.com/z0K1GKh

I think TSLA is up, what, 3%? The surge in EV stocks has been going on for days/weeks while TSLA has only had that S&P 500 bump going for it and only in the past couple of days.
It almost upon us 🙏
Thank you GME gods

I started a position after earnings at 13 and sold at 17. I don’t see how this is trading higher than before earnings when their earnings were horrendous. 100% I think it’s a smart move, but this thing seems to have retard strength so idk.
GAMESTOP IT’S HAPPENING LOOK AT THAT VOLUME
You’re a real dumbass 🤦‍♂️
Thoughts on BLNK ceiling?
With cultured meat about to get into our super markets and plant-based meat alternatives on the rise, shorting Tyson Food is free tendies.
well the good news is that you have even more time to make tendies, highly likely that it's $600+ by April.
Thanks, yeah that’s what I’m hoping will happen to them.
Undervalued how? Comparing then to Logitech, which is running at $80 ish with nearly 3 times the EPS and much higher market cap, I expect CRSR to stop at $40 ish. I mean I hope it goes to space, I have calls in CRSR. I just dont expect it to.
EV craze is hitting everything related. Huge gains across battery, EV and related stocks. Good time to get some profit! Just gotta keep a close eye on things if need to bail. Seems to be all related to Tesla surge. Thanks papa Elon!
Now people are saying that the likes of Apple can crush Sonos as they sell their own related products 🤷‍♂️

It’s just the cycle I’ve seen from watching it the past month or so. I think it’s a great stock to hold but I don’t see calls paying off if they are weeklies or monthlies. More likely to catch the pop with long dates calls or shares

These browning slopes really had me hyped for a minute
yup. high bearish sentiment is the maybe the only sure fire way of knowing we are going higher.
GME saving my broke ass lmfao
All my calls are 30c and 35c in March, so not too worried about short term. Although I may hop in with a few earnings 40c lottos. Should have done it yesterday. Great long term potential into 2021 here.
Probably announcing another tiktok competition.
Hold until $300k son. Then hopefully we have an equities pullback and you can dump it into promising new companies and retire in 15 years.

From an OpEx perspective RKT can do everything their competitors can do, only cheaper.

RIP my portfolio
Double down on ZM or scoop some TSLA and GME 🤔
You should watch this documentary (forgot what it was called). But essentially the whole idea of “invisible hand” will not accelerate the EV market in the US (it actually hinders it). There has to be government intervention, which “socialist” and “communist” counties/continents like Europe and Asia provides. Look at Norway and it’s adoption rate of EV. There is no way US will catch up purely through “consumer demand”.
Idt it’ll hit 230 tbh

Thanks for the heads up got in at 13.46 after hours for 250 shares. Up almost 1k today appreciate your dd.
Truth. The bag isn't just heavy, it's getting dusty too. The very idea that companies need to be very profitable disgusts me.
??
So retail investors saw the rise of Tesla coming but not the smart money? the index funds and people who are going to buy Tesla shares due to S&P 500 inclusion had no clue about this and hence held no positions or calls??? Sounds strange that S&P 500 inclusion would prompt smart money to spend exorbitant sums to buy Tesla shares. Also, wouldn’t there be laws or regulations governing what happens when a company is included or dropped off the index...S&P 500 is revised every quarter to drop and include companies and that doesn’t seem to affect the share prices much due to finds buying into it due to inclusion or exclusion
flat as hell
I sleet long dated calls print as the company starts to generate huge income off their distribution.
yes

GME😍
Imagine if you bought calls.
it's camber angle
Nah it can. We’ve seen what KBIO did, 10,000% off a similar situation squeeze. OSTK was 70% short and went from about 15 to 130, that was 70% short and was much more stable of a squeeze. If Cohen buys out GME and loaned out shares must be sent back, shorts will scramble to cover. They won’t even be able to cover on day 1 becuase a lot of the shares shorted are fake, synthetic shares. So their will be a fail to deliver and shorts will just be fucked. They’ll have to wait and buy at high bids and just limit pain. I know it sounds insane, but you can’t gauge this situation, it’s never happened before, the only thing a little similar is KBIO, which went form 40 cents to 43 dollars. Ppl will be rapidly buying calls and mms will have to hedge as well buying shares, but they literally won’t be able to at some point, it will jus be a cluster fuck
NIO EOW?
Great. I will buy a few hundred hope not late to the party.

As a Tesla call holder, I’m genuinely baffled at how nio can keep going up
I think I bought some tsla puts a bit early, but I still feel my vibe about it going back below 500 in the next hour
I have some 31 DEC calls, that’s the literal definition of long term
save it for tomorrow
no, I said book value per share. Very rarely is a company valued at 1 X book value. That would be an extremely easy value play - those hardly exist.
Same
Honestly man, best way to beat them is to not buckle in and pay the aftermarket price. Let them bag hold the 15 they bought. Stock will come into retail sooner or later. Hope you get one soon.

We're all tards here, buy away
You know that might not be half retarded, but I'd go with stocks instead of calls on it. NIU, NIO, XPEV and LI have been pretty much tied together, when one is doing good they all do good, and vice versa

The majority of stock owners do not know what covered calls are or how to use them, shit it might be 85% or more even.

It is THAT bad. Sooo much profit just sitting there wasting away.
yall talking about CIIC, PLTR, XPEV, NIO, BABA, but ROKU put up 1k% today on weeklies.
Q4 will be GMEs last profitable quarter.  After the short squeeze they go on the slow train to bankruptcy.  Drop > Buyback > Drop > Close some stores > Drop > Buyback > Drop > Drop >Bankruptcy.

&#x200B;

But all that is irrelevant.  After the short squeeze doesn't matter.

Got some 11/27 17c that are gonna print 100% returns by Wednesday. Calling it now.
I seriously feel bad for eBay. I remember back in 2000s when kids figured out how to sell their Diablo 2 items and eBay was like NOPE gotta be a physical item so throw in some card with that if you really want to sell your Amazon warrior princess'es used leather underwear. Just shows that no competitive advantage lasts forever, there is always some moron who fucks it up. Now I just gotta keep questioning myself - am I that moron?
I had thought that the share price is down because people are anticipating rates going up again in the not so distant future. Competition of course makes sense though
not yet
Remember everyone was saying amazon 4000 eoy? It's been flat for half a year
It’s easy. It’s like coupons for stocks controlled by Greeks, then you can shape it into animals like condor or butterflies. Sometimes it goes down but most of the time it goes up.

Maybe some insiders know something about CCL we don’t...
Lmao
EWLL. Looks like it’s been reduced to a mere 2 billion now (OS is only about 10 billion I think, so perhaps it was a glitch). The trips plays are fun to watch sometimes. Lots of shenanigans on the OTC.
PTON you piece of garbage how are you just going to give up all the gains
Invest in SDNY, SEC, and NY county investigations.

Dude people want to avoid the grocery store. Chili's near me had long line for curbside pickup
Well done DD ... completely agree. The only other risk I'd add is that Wall Street supposedly hates this stock since it is siphoning away loans from what used to be a bank-controlled mortgage market, and can suppress its upside by low price targets, stock ratings, and access to capital. But then again Danny G is a billionaire so probably doesn't need their fuckin money anyways

God damn.
welcome to IV and theta, friend
why wtf? you essentially just bought your retirement yacht
Yes
Lol yeah I sure would be happy with losing that much money.   Is that why you're about to sell your car to buy more puts?

I won't have a car payment until I get my CT, but that's just because I can earn more with the 70k over 3 years then I'd save by paying off a loan at 1.99% APR.

I'm sure these are unfamiliar concepts to you, like "fiscally solvent", "good credit" and "making money" but keep at it slugger.  One day you'll move to the register from the fry station.
On the plus side, we have hospital capacity.

Theta feasting on pltr
Covid cases are up astronomically from the first crash, unemployment is still just as bad, lots of states headed for lockdown for the next several months at best. Obviously we are headed for a crash, no one should need to look at a chart to see that. However, we've learned in this market that logic, charts, basically any type of research doesn't matter at all. So you're probably wrong
hate to burst your bubble but GME is not going to 300-400

if there is a massive squeeze it has a chance to go into the high 80's-low 100's
Have been wondering the same thing...
Hoooooly shit lol
honestly this might be the detriment of XPEV?

Nah keep buying

PLTR 10:1 stock split coming in 2024 when it hits 3k
They are currently going public via a SPAC with CIIC. So I just invested in CIIC and once the merger is complete, the ticker will be Arrival's. This way they just skip the IPO's.
Yeah I can mail them to you if you want!
BABA please end above 262
Plus they would all only need one kidney so you’ve got multiple revenue streams here
Let's review the top meme stocks on this sub:

what about SBE
SHEDDING PALANTEARS ..........of joy
That’s a fucking dude u gay bear
Because I’m sour that I held my calls while they were at ATH lol just not looking to get crushed when they close under 505
lol yeah that’s a little much. I mean I pointed it out but didn’t mean it as a comparison to worth
while detailed DD (thank you), RSI itself isnt anything useful, oversold is possible because of dimming prospect on the business outlook. From TA perspective we need to include additional analysis (trend following, trend reversal, and momentum are the big three i know) for swing trading, for long term hold, as a mortgage company, economy doesnt look better off since covid first hit, in fact i feel like it’s going to be worse for a while, stock market has been decoupled with the economy is my take, so i would argue they are better off right now then they would be if the rates start going back up and mortgage applications start falling due to prolonged covid shutdown/ slow economy
Am I missing something with Zoom?  Why in the world would a glorified Skype application be worth as much as it is?
Lol I knew they were poised to have a good earnings. I put them in my list ready to buy, but then I got distracted by other positions.

Oh well, hindsight is 20/20 😂

[deleted]
That shit is going beyond the Oort cloud.
The problem I have with this "impending stock market crash" scenario is the following:

The Buffet model looks at total market cap/GDP. GDP has been adversely effected by COVID -related shutdowns. Once a vaccine is distributed and cases go down, GDP will rise quickly (quicker than a housing bubble crash for instance). People will get rehired at a faster rate once businesses start opening again and demand rises. Inn the meantime, stocks will continue to go up on good vaccine/Covid news. Cases are at records highs so there isn't really much more bad news COVID can give us. 

Yes, the market may be overvalued right now but (aside from vacation stocks) businesses will come back quickly once places reopen. As a result, GDP will come back quickly. Absolutely there will be dips, but we are not going to see a sell-off like the sell-off that occurred in March.

This is your first DD you say? Goodluck with RKT, people were just as hype a couple weeks back. It’s still trending down.
If pltr is going back up to the highest why are my calls not doing the same thing. It's back to where it was earlier when my calls made me over 100 but it says my calls are only making me 50? Are my calls somehow losing value?

Last chance to buy CIIC before it moons after market another 25%
I'll load up on 100 contracts of GME $13s...but I don't see it going there. It'll probably drop to $12 again and bounce between $12-12.50 for the next month.
NIO is poorly managed, can say that - not sure about xpeng...

too much show not enough go in nio, you know? should be far ahead of where they are but again poorly run

Made $100 on a TSLA call and $64 on a SPY call and ran for the hills.
They have good prices and solid selection of pet items. I've uused it a few times but still prefer to take the doggo to the store with me to get his food.
it already has, get shares and play theta gang for gods sake
Quick, shitpost the NIO/ Neo matrix meme!

We need uppies before close!
F
Ban
They are clear. “Adult Only” 

Mature isn’t Adult only. 

They are 2 completely different ratings.
Lmao. You can't catch a break
NIO actually has double the float of Xpeng, share price doesn't mean anything here.
Buy this tesla dip weak hands
600. Or at least that’s the strike price I bought today.
thanks for the input! I wasn't aware!
That’s the smart play. I have 550C 12/11
You guys killed CRSR :(
Shit had BBY open this morning and didn't buy
no, no reason tbh
🙏🙏🙏🍎🚀
So like when the vaccine comes out are charts gonna start looking like handicap ramps instead of ski slopes
Thats a nice exponential graph you got there. Are you gonna keep it going?
Thank Force it's Thursday

One more day to yolo left
My 11/27 GME 14C I've had since early this week made my penis shoot cream. Does anyone know what this stuff is? Is it safe to eat?
Sung to the tune of "Everyone's a little bit racist".
It’s hilarious how little respect this stock has despite how extraordinarily close they are to legitimate Wall Street lore. It’s incredible that their market cap is barely 5 billion.
Yet.
Referring to companies like NKLA or FUV
HAVE YOU GUYS WROTE TO SANTA YET?!?!
🌈 🐻
OP has too many charts and things underlined in red to be wrong. I just sold all my NIO calls, bought gold bars and buried them in my neighbors yard.
Title says CIIC, meme says CIIG.


Which one will get me tendies?

Sorry I don’t have time to read all 17 thousand comments in the daily thread. I thought my sample of 100 would be representative of the rest
doesnt matter when in 20yrs everyone is riding teslas
Hey NVDA would really appreciate it if you got off your ass
Should I throw in the towel for these 11/20 550c (tsla) ? I'm giving up hope of a rebound today.
I hope I’m just retarded and not seeing the sarcasm here. Otherwise you’re bigly retarded
Depends on how long you live.
plug probs
F off retard
I love this movie. The acting is phenomenal.
Well I put in 70k just enough to run a few wheels
Watch your expiration tho don’t be a complete autist
Idk man faang looks out of steam
Scooping ABNB shares as soon as they IPO
Lmao you think people who use Robinhood actually understand what earnings reports mean?
I think 50k plus, also depends on how quick you lose it
Don’t do it to yourself. AAPL is boomer stock

Ok so I bought PLTR like you all said and now you retards are saying it's not going to do shit?
Only have one unfortunately, probably sell here soon just to lock it in, what are you riding on?

Guess which EV company BABA is investing in
PINS need to stop fucking around and run to at least 90 so I can dump my calls.

All them beckies and stacies are up in this bitch - buy this shit
same, in both but my XPEV position isn't very big sadly
I joined the tesla hype so pretty sure this is it.
they have different # of shares... idiot
Lol, that's true. Just ate inside a sushi restaurant last night in california, everything is supposed to be to go only
so in NYC we're not supposed to have more than 6 people over for Thanksgiving. Are they gonna send the gestapo to go door to door and check or something? wtf

I played over 450% IV onn FCEL earlier
some bullshit -- need nio to go up like another 3 dollars lol
lmaoooo baba strikes again!
For a company barely breaking even, 500bil evaluation is a steal
 u ain't gonna do shit
Premise 3 is trash 

he even says so in his own explaination of his stance

> the Feds power is..... effective. 

then goes on to just arbitrarily say that won't be true for long. it's objectively effective though, and he seemingly understands why.  

don't bet against America.
I think we rip in to close and possibly even tomorrow a bit. I'm thinking the Trump presser this afternoon is for the EUA for PFE's vaccine. We will run because the market has ripped on every peice of vaccine news so far. However, I think tomorrow we will end the day red and next week will be deep red.
this post is so good
[deleted]
4 million volume today though
Any chance for FCEL to gap up for this last hour and a half or no?
NANI
been dipping for two weeks mate
BABA you were doing so well..
Yes. Solos market cap will be triple what it is today by the time these expire.
Bull flag on TSLA...I hope
Is CIIC gonna pop again tomorrow?
Maybe this GM dude can say synergy again
Well, you haven't blown your account all the way to the truck stop bathroom, so you're doing better than 97% of wsb...
If those are for January, 3015, then yeah
Just never had the same hype since that massive dump it took from $15. My January calls have never recovered.
congrats
i sold all my XPENG on the last boom and now it’s up even higher. it’ll be red one day, and then buy it again.

chinese ev stocks ftw
This is the way. I sold my xpeng today at $44 for crsr, missing 12% gains.
NOI #1  


TSLA #10
Bullish on both
holding fcel an pltr cuz someone said 🚀 and my dumbass believed
There has been massive inflation since 2012, just look at housing values. I feel like I am arguing with an antivaxer here, which obviously can’t be true, since you are clearly the most autistic person in this sub.
Regulatory planning isnt enough to justify a company’s long term roadmap? lmao
Gaayyyy

I swear if these calls don't print I'm going to falcon punch my neighbor's child.
I did.  I watch this one and it’s a rollercoaster
XPEV puts before close = guaranteed money
Ofc I wouldn't touch 11/20
i hope it does lol, wanted to put more money into GME but not at this price
Any reason?
whats ur next move
Man I wish I’m in Texas or Florida. This stupid lockdown in Illinois is messing up our Friendsgiving plans.
CCL is an EV company now apparently
If it keeps rejecting it means it won't stop going up.
oh god gme. here we go again
XPEV just passed up NIO, this is SOME BULL
only 0DAY
I think he didn't get the degree actually... just the debt.
If youre a literal child maybe
Anyone else think FB and AAPL are going to blast off soon? They’ve been pretty flat for over a week. Might pick up some Dec calls at close.
Buy CAnt cuck the zuck
🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
So are you going to share your gains with us or not?
How many posters here rlare Chinese bots lol
This was from about an hour ago at the Barclays event . GM CEO didn’t even whisper NKLAs name but talked a bunch about building their own EV vehicles.
Man this EV pump is crazy, what’s next tech?
Yessir
This is such a fun week. All my holdings taking turns making big moves moonward.
Holy fuck my GME calls went from -60% to -48% 😱😱💯👍💯🆙🆙🥰❇️❇️🥰🌈
And no....u can't just "wait a day after selling." It is T+2 days.

You are just full of useless information arent you...
XPEV passed NIO
This is painful
realistically like 14 bucks prolly
I'm holding 1dte $355p

I'm not expecting a crash, but the downtrend is pretty obvious
My IWM 160p’s 2/18 disagree
Truth over facts!
I went in big on PLTR @ 9.97 and SBE @ 15.60, AMA
Yeah I'm an idiot... Hey they're up like $15,000 already
i got dec 18 calls with strike price of 40$   
will def sell before then but nice to make some quick tendies
Bought in early October for the Ant group ipo but doubled down at 256. Good luck
[deleted]
Ok so the short squeeze won’t happen just off this move lmao. Earnings are in a few weeks. There is a good chance Ryan Cohen buys out GME after those earnings, IF he does do this, literally moonshot, I can’t even gauge what price we’d hit from this, 300-400 is my estimate, maybe more. After shareholders vote, short sold shares must get recalled. So shorts are fucked if that happens and it’s just limiting pain at that point
Just letting you know I have strong respect for your argument for more skin in the game.
It's ok PLTR baby take your time, I can wait, just keep going up
Hang out with retards, behave like a retard
NIO wake yo punk ass up!!!!
EV run started like a few weeks ago. Hardly at the point of bursting.
Fuck. No day trade left and I have been banned from my RH. This might cost me $2k for diamonds hands
Oooohhhhh, you were too nice to be a magic man, they are pure evil, always saying that growing +10000000% is not posible for the invisible resistence or something like that
Glad you are the person I’m trading against. A lot of stupid comments. According to your premise 1 you would’ve missed out of the run up of stocks in the last decade. Also, ever consider that the long-term low interest rate environment (with signaling that it will continue to be like this) fundamentally causes valuation multiples to re-rate? That’s the problem with historical analysis, the world is fundamentally different now. So why are multiples expanding? Because interest rates are low and investors need to reach for riskier and risked investments to maintain rates of return. Essentially chasing yield. Investors go for treasury to IG to HY to blue chip and beyond. By your logic, you would’ve gotten out of the market in 2015 waiting for the dip, which didn’t come until the pandemic five years later and you still would’ve been worse off lol. I’ve seen so many people try to time markets and it’s hilarious to watch. Take another page out of Buffett/Graham’s handbook and think about mr market. Do you need to sell now? Think about it as owning a business instead of a stock and you make much better decisions. FYI, you think Buffett is out of the market now? Haha

While the ‘market’ has become over valued, look at why. The breadth of the recent run up from covid has been extremely narrow. Almost all of the run up has been in only a handful of stocks- FAANGM. Take a look at the market valuation excluding these stocks and you will see a great opportunity. As vaccine optimism works its way into the rest of the market, you will see a rotation to value and cyclical stocks and likely out of tech. What does that do to overall valuation of the market? Who is to say.It will probably keep it flattish, but bigger names will have less influence on the overall market as the capital will be dispersed to the rest of the market. 

Running on vaccine fumes is a joke, where do you think the market will be in March when the vaccine is in the process of rolling out?

When people say the fed is printing money it’s because it’s effectively true. They are increasing the money supply by purchasing newly issued treasuries from banks. It credits the banks, which is treated like cash even though it doesn’t print cash. The cash is considered bank reserves, but banks only are required to hold a specific amount of reserves so all extra is used to maximize profit through lending/purchasing of long duration assets. You highlighted increasing amounts in high quality securities. Go down to line 9 oh they are increasing loans and leases as well. Oh and that number is 2x the size of treasury and agency securities lmao. Premise 5: feds funds are entering the market that is why you are seeing the markets stabilize (that downward tick). Banks don’t just hold the reserves in hand. They lose out on yield. Even if they are buying bonds, lending, etc. that money enters the economy. Sure they may be holding more reserves than before, but that is natural in a pandemic! Premise 7: the market is forward looking and most of the unemployment is viewed as temporary. As the pandemic drags on, more and more losses will become permanent, but they will be nowhere near as high as ‘08. Probably shake out somewhere around 6%. 

Again, glad you are the person on the other side of the table. FYI, I work professionally in the markets.

Which do you think will hit $100 first? Considering dropping 26k into one of them. Shares. HYLN, SPCE, or PLUG?
I reckon it'll pump again tomorrow
Xpeng passing NIO?
so what’s the move
Yes I am actually thinking about playing this meme 😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️
A million share wall? That’s weak. Will be gobbled up in minutes with this volume if it’s running hot. Side note, Just checked my OTC list and saw one with a 10 billion share wall lol. Now that’s impressive
Let me guess you did not read the entire post to the bottom where it said to buy the ITM LEAPS?

If you did the then theta will not be much of a factor for IV and theta becomes less of a factor as well (I bought a big chunk of Jan 2023 $10s)

Now I can sit back and not give a fuck for 6 months, although I think this thing could rocket to 60-80 in 3-4 months and I would sell have to lock in gains.

Must of the tards here will only buy FDs a week to maybe a month out and sell during a down spike or wait it out until they become worthless.

Discloser I did buy some of the $25s and $30s just for the fuck of it knowing full well they are retarded as fuck.
Sold the SOLO, glhf
11/20 356p
First all of what you said is speculation. GM CEO spoke today and said nothing about NKLA and they are not going to do anything until NKLA lawsuits are done which could be a long time. GM is the safer play but knowing this site NKLA will be pumped and bag holders will be newly minted.
Buy best buy.
roll the dice and see if they're bluffing
That strategy hasn’t worked for them at all this year, to say the very very very least. Bloomberg did an in-depth reporting on quant strategies in 2020

Here is your proof:    
1. PFE announces conveniently right after the election (no I'm not a Trumptard).     
2. MRNA (with fucking shady management) anounces within days and with better efficacy.     
3. PFE corrects its numbers right after.     
4. There has never been a vaccine based on mRNA ever, and all of this happens at about the same time.

It’s not really a momentum stock. It’s a long term hold. Wouldn’t recommend fd’s on this one
Got it. All in SPY calls
So what your saying is there’s more Gains to be made
So buy Coty calls or what. We need the information man
Is CNBC saying anything about GM and NKLA? I'm on a call and only see that they're making a big EV investment (which was already known)
Sell 20C

Yeah I bought it yesterday hahaha
China’s EV market went I think doubled this year if I’m not mistaken. And we all know about NIO, who knows they could rake it in if they secure some deals with these big EV players. It’s risky for sure but I feel it could be good.

I watched a video a while back about them and it’s seriously impressive, especially for the UK market which is where they are based. “Fully charged” is a YouTube channel based around EVs which is where I saw Arrival initially and I’d seriously recommend checking them out. They had Xpeng and NIO covered for a while. Wish I’d jumped on both much earlier
Also, the reason behind the question I posted is because the people that hold the same opinion as you tend to think only 1 dimensionally - "free college is good" while ignoring the vast number of issues involving the implementation and social/economic implications of such an idea.
Bull trap
sounds like you didn't hold your options in Nio? I'm pissed i sold. I would have made money.
Soros has a nice surprise for any PLTR holders at 20$
At the end of a day it’s a penny stock that can jump or drop 40% at anytime. Basically the same as playing roulette and going black or red.

Scary how a marker wide red day would be with this one
Dip BABA Dip, i want back in.  Need some more Chyna tendies.
How in the world do you manage to sell PLTR at a loss? It’s like 30 cents from all time highs.
If I was a foreign investor and watch that Rudy G shit show and realized that is the lawyer of the current POTUS probably would be dumping them to.

Thinking a big gap up eod till Monday
I've noticed this sub is just filled with wanna be wallstreet people who laugh at your investments because "Lol chinese" or whatever while throwing all their mad money acronyms around. 

Meanwhile I've gone up 30% just today. 

The morpheus gif posted about NIO 2 days ago was accurate af. 

You wan't 10% yearly? Go ahead, Im going balls deep on that red pill.
Am watching that too :)
robinhood is actually better than TOS lmao
👍
What do you think it will go up to? Agreed tho, its not being spoken about much.
CRM to 300 in coming weeks for earnings run up
Did you just wake up from a coma
I have 125 spy calls that expire tomorrow strike 165. Why?. Cause fuvk it.
He said could.  He's not wrong.  It technically "could" go to zero.  You're the dumb dick reading stupid click bait. Ain't none of them fucks know dick.
Buying but $2.5 calls available for me
🍻 to those that downvoted SOLO doing a 30% day this AM.
Place your bets. Who's going to 50 first. Nio / DKNG?
baba don’t tease
COTY on his alt.
Cap.
What was the DD? For GME?
They have... read the Q3 ER. But I know too many words.
Summary - stonks go up.
TSLA has been fighting 500 all day.

Just let it happen.
Just woke up to BABA's first potential green day after 8 straight Red days... Congrats call/share holders. Although im out of BABA since 290
PINS week chart looks fucking insane.
It’s prob too late with this run but I jumped on the train anyway. There goes my last 1000!
I appreciated the insight but shorted SPY yesterday
Shit my man you aren't kidding. Let's just get it back up there and get rich!
lmao up bigly on it and its only gonna go up more. why u buying shitty weeklies
$RIDE is kil just do some TA
CRSR 11/27 40c printing baby
Got a whiteboard up on the wall. Still down 22% yoy until I break even. Should hit that within the next week or so. Up close to 300% in the last 30days.
SPY puts too obvious. Which means I inverse. But then I have to inverse myself because I'm retarded. Now I'm back at SPY puts. What do
Naw, I think I actually saw her post here a couple times, p sure it's the same one.
Yeah Spy is so undervalued it should be at at least 550 and the S&P should drop all stocks and only invest into EV companies.
FUV is just a meme right guys?  I mean their car looks like a tricycle.  No one's gonna want that.
Get your shit together Tesla
You must have scrolled through like what 20 comments? People have been talking about blink for hours
send my condolence
NIU looking like a solid run up before earnings next week. Still a sleeper at this point. Hoping to break that $40 mark and run from there.
I catch that and was like are they talking about ‘nkla’?! Seems like they want to avoid a loaded question/topic
[deleted]
Bad time for me to have a $13 call sell on the table. It was $0.05 today and now $0.25 ffs
SPY 360 EOD tomorrow, please and thank you in advance
Enjoy 😉
Can someone explain to me what the big deal about corsair is
Do they have customers to supply batteries to?
It’s gonna come back down to 11 tho
12/18, 5.5 strike. Only 3 contracts though. Easy 1-2k profits.
No hoes on Tumblr.

Nice. Smart
Up 7% today and 33% for the week. Yup its dead alright 🙄
I pray for you 🙏
12/14 300c cause they were what I could afford
My only regret is not going all in on nano dimension =_=
Boy I know you seen the Hummer EV doing the crabwalk 🦀
Ive had FUV  $10c 4/16/21.  Up Over 125% today. What do I do with them now?
I'm short tern, but when it comes to determining how long I'll hold, I take it day by day
WHAT DID HE POST
rug pull imminent
Yeah I was surprised at how low it was as well--also considering it's a Japanese country and the dollar is probably going to fall so that'll get it up even higher.

No. EV is the last bubble. There will be no more bubbles after that.
Why not? I’m just confused why you wouldn’t give it one more shot tomorrow. It will at least spike in the morning again

Since Feb 17 2020
Who just bought 52c NIO weeklies from me?

Thank you
Because it is Thursday. Check the charts. For the last 6 weeks or so GME has mooned on Thursday and crashed on Friday when everyone either exercises their options or they expire worthless.
$23.5 next week.
at this point I’m all in on BABA, HYLN, FB and puts on some shit called EFA
you're the moron that bought the options based on random posts
My calls would be worth about $5.5k ($4.4k profit) + IV. I'd be cool with that.
Yea that was dumb, I got in at 13 originally then bought more at 15
Is SOLO actually with investing in long term. Those things look pretty stupid to me. Who the fuck would ride one?? Will the develop real cars in the future?
I mean they’re expiring tomorrow sometimes you gotta cut losses
thoughts on JD? dropped hard after earnings, could be a good dip to buy
The stock is up 19% since Monday. Maybe you should start looking at the mirror.
Why is this bullshit pinned gay mods
Honestly these “analysts” are no more accurate than your typical WSB shit poster.

thinking a big dump eod?
Or a man who isn't a degenerate gambler.  Again its the Macy's of video games.  At least shit like Tesla and NIO have a chance to change the world.
It turns out that if you change the weekly part of all these options into long then you can actually make a lot of money off of these idiots

Im starting a rumor about BABA’s new EV
Got a couple calls today for 40c 12/18. Let see how tomorrow plays out. But won’t lie don’t know much about the company just see that it keeps ripping.
Tis bullshit
Is mango speaking at 4 or just pence? If it’s just pence there won’t be a ridiculous vaccine pump.
Puts on ebay. Thanks !!!
She'll need the money soon. Bitch is shorting TSLA.
Still hanging out at the bottom of that channel. I would sell half if possible just to protect some profit and avoid holding too many expiring options overnight
Xpeng is the new Nio.
Oh damn, I'm in danger of not getting assigned shares on my GME $13 sold puts tomorrow.

What's wrong with a bright future?
SOLO is amazing today
So, let me get this straight. /u/namsilat posts the greatest DD of all time and mods ban him for it. So dude makes his own sub, and mods now ban anyone who mentions him? I'm not saying, but I'm just saying.

 I'll probably get banned for this comment but the dude did it again two weeks ago, and again yesterday.  This place really shot itself in the foot.
WSB as a life style
Where do you work where you can fall asleep lol
It is Thursday. Thursday has been when GME has mooned for a month or more now. Then on Friday everyone sells their options and it drops again.

Yeah that's what I'm most worried about, I'm glad I saw your comment cause I almost sold at 95-97 range it was stuck at and then it popped to 504 so thanks for that. When they announced the stock split I sold for 500 profit and the next day it would've been 5500 so I think I have some ptsd from that

Odd. I didn't see a bulge, so I'm not sure you'll make any money.

And I’m riding the wave as well. If you like TTD but for under$15, MGNI is the answer
Even a dead hooker is more useful and pleasurable than falling Baba shares
GrowGeneration (GRWG) $40c Jan 15 2021 & 35c, same date.

MP Materials (MP) $17.5c Jan 15 2021 & $22.5c March 19 2021.

Cinemark (CNK) $22.5c June 18 2021

I will be buying shares of MP and GRWG too, not just options. Options only for Cinemark tho, I'm not interested in putting capital towards them for longer than the date of the call, I can use the money elsewhere in places that will move faster. Cinemark will go back up tho in the next few months once the vaccine is released.
Robinhood is so much more user friendly than tos. I know i am learning a new app on tos, but everything just seems to flow much easier on rh and easier to navigate, streamlined to be easy for rtards. Maybe there is customizeable settings i am missing on tos but, still

Where did her jawline go
AYRO up 37%
The difference is in extrinsic value. The 2 options are priced differently because the greeks are not the same, particularly delta and vega.

buy more.. we're going up and fast.. soon
What tends to happen on expiration weeks like today? A lot of options gonna expire tommorow
Id cum and then retire. I think it may go in for some sort of retest so get your diamond hands ready if so.
My man :( 

&#x200B;

I said Calls on CRSR bro not PLTR :(
Right, kick ass. Well, don't want to sound like a dick or nothin', but, ah... it says on your chart that you're fucked up.  You talk like a f@g, and your shit's all retarded. 

Don't worry, scrote. There are plenty of tards out there living really kick-ass lives. My first wife was tarded. She's a pilot now. 

My advice is to leave wsb immediately.

Just bought $2000 worth of qqqj calls. Not sure how this will go
Even for Sept. and Oct. it went down a total of $20 versus February where it dropped to 200.00. If you draw a line between the charts you will see that there is also a point after that where it rebounded almost too much in September and actually evenly distributes to it's current price.
check FIS, both FIS and FISV are closely related.

&#x200B;

mainly FISV is benefitting from google pay parternship with exxon. plus the fact it has a $110-120 pT forever and only broke through until after baccine news/post-earnings overselling.
Hmm. This sub has only handed me losses when I listen to people but at the same time it provides  tons of tickers with potential

NKLA was the implied "final question" from the moderator about "one specific" partnership commercial opportunities for their Ultium battery and fuel cells.

And Mary Barra said she had no update or comment. And went on to say how they were focusing on their own lines.

I would bet money that GM had agreed upon rules that the moderator could not mention NKLA by name.
It’ll dump. Right, RIGHT??

I'm so freaking irritated by this market.. how the fuck is it valued where it is? It's obviously undervalued and SPY should be at $380 by now.. when the hell are people going to figure this out?

You guys wait.. the elevator is going up soon. Be sure to have calls
ye i work in finance and would instadelete this account if i got doxxed lmfao

If you have to ask....
GME!?
Except FSR
11/2021 LEAPs 12c, 1/15 20c, 20 shares. Not a huge portfolio, but roughy 75% allocation
sell them n00b
Counter Argument: Black Friday and Christmas are approaching, therefore, stonks only go up.
rip the guy who said YY puts for today was easy money
They are going to be the Zune of vaccines at this point.  A crappy knock off delivered way too late.
When you ask about 'holding for while' , of course,  I've held positions for 2 and even sometimes 3 days.  This is the way...
There is a dump coming EOD just wait
See what I shoulda done was buy GME like 5 minutes ago
Nothing just GM putting down more cash for EV stuff.
They've already scanned this comment and you are now on their database for future mind-manipulation. A benefit of owning their stock is they don't target you with their algorithms.
If only we didn't have to pay taxes
yeah this is pathetic
What is happening with GME??? I was at an exam
This is out of the blue but does tesla being added to the s&p mean that s&p etfs will go up aswell?

What’s your usual plays?
Well if you take November's daily OHLC and a linear extrapolation from that:

Open: 18.78

High: 19.86

Low: 17.88

Close: 18.9

That's pretty much like reading tea leaves so I wouldn't trust it much. I don't think it will cross 19 until a gap up over the weekend.

Im getting the impression some institutional investor sold a bunch of Hyln calls and cant let it get too far over $25 for this week or until they exit.
Just wait until the people who sell cars in volume decide it’s time to start making money on EV’s and all these low volume plays get eaten up.

I also have ebay calls(3) but I'm holding them for the same idea as this guy. The black friday/holiday season rally giving them a jump back up to ~55 and will sell as soon as that happens. Short term its fine but I'm definitely not even holding one contract now to try and milk profits from. Good post brother 🙏 I LOVE VALUABLE INFORMATION FROM FELLOW AUTIST 😀

Wow looks like even gold and REITs are trying to go green now.
crsr compared to its competitor logi is undervalued. logi has 2x revenue but 4x mcap, so crsr should be valued at 7bn which is ~75usd per share

What is mgni and why did my coworker just go all in lol
Youre a fucking moron ya moron. You don't know shit. You will be able to buy and sell in a cash account only 3 times in a 12 month period before you are flagged. I have been doing this a lot longer than you dipshit so read this and you just might learn something.

Good faith violation

What is it? A good faith violation occurs when you buy a security and sell it before paying for the initial purchase in full with settled funds. Only cash or the sales proceeds of fully paid for securities qualify as "settled funds."

Liquidating a position before it was ever paid for with settled funds is considered a "good faith violation" because no good faith effort was made to deposit additional cash into the account prior to settlement date. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur good faith violations:

Good faith violation example, Marty:

Cash available to trade = $0.00

On Monday morning, Marty sells XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds

On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000

If Marty sells ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.

Good faith violation example, Trudy:

Cash available to trade = $10,000, all of which is settled

On Monday morning, Trudy buys $10,000 of XYZ stock

On Monday mid-day, she sells XYZ stock for $10,500

At this point, Trudy has not incurred a good faith violation because she had sufficient settled funds to pay for the purchase of XYZ stock at the time of the purchase. However:

Near market close on Monday, Trudy buys $10,500 of ABC stock

On Tuesday afternoon, she sells ABC stock and incurs a good faith violation

This trade is a violation because Trudy sold ABC before Monday's sale of XYZ stock settled and those proceeds became available to pay for the purchase of ABC stock

Consequences: If you incur 3 good faith violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.
GME spicy!

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1789760/000119312520297313/d40716dex991.htm
If they go with the multi tranche approach, then the first date is Dec.14th, and the memo sent out says they are discussing whether it would be 25% then 75% on the 18th or 50/50. So as early as the 14th is when they could start buying shares. However, the analysis I came across said the other funds tracking the spy can start buying right away. All this buying pressure is the reason it will keep going up and people/funds are trying to get in early as they know they'll have to pay a higher price the longer they stay on the sidelines. I think 600 is a good target price by inclusion date.

I sold 30% of my shares, I’m a believer this upswing isn’t a bull trap but who know. Used that money to diversify a bit. I’m going to hold this for the Biden presidency because I see a lot of movement toward outright banning IC vehicles and these guys make lithium batteries. If I see it dip to maybe $4 I’ll put more in.

To the guy who was sharing ultra bearish charts at 3 AM this morning, I hope you sold at open, you fucking weapon.

Rated M games aren’t adult only. They are rated M for mature.

TSLA puts seem a little disrespectful
I mean you answered your own question..
They are ITM now.
I've been re-analysing my position like crazy the last few days. Thought I'd really caught the falling knife on this one.

It looked undervalued with holidays basically here and potentially good news over the next 2-3 months for the Ant IPO. 

Plus, China forecasted to be half the demand for luxury goods by 2025, and the trend increasing for most of that purchasing happening online.... seems like this can only go up.

Where else are people gonna put their money, bonds or savings at like 0.25%? lol
Bidu looks like it tends to fill gaps within the very next day or three days. That means it might play in the 139-142 range tomorrow.
GM taking off
PLTR green dildos
1-2 months til expiration. 10-15% out of the money. Buy when the stock dips and ideally have the strike below the main resistance levels so you don't get cucked and expire OTM. And try to sell to close with 2-3 weeks left, leave some meat on the bone. Trend is your friend. Use MACD on the 1 month chart to see how momentum looks. Good luck.

Dude, I closed my shit out at close yesterday. I didn’t have the balls to hold through. Something told me I’d regret it when it mooned into the high 40’s but somehow I made the right call. Took what little profit I made and I’m happy with it. I think if the election shenanigans didn’t fuck with it leading up to earnings we would’ve been smiling big right now.

I agree with most points you said. One question regarding banks: they do create money though via fractional reserves added by the central bank or not? That they don’t lend it out is another (valid) point. In general I also see the economy is a dangerous position.

actually I like the buy earlier today crossing above 258.50... but imo the short term buy is in in... see how much follow thru it gets

I'm fairly sure that's a bot written article. Over 50% and may be as high as 80% of articles on platforms like this are. Even Marketwatch uses AI to write most of its articles. and there are versions that (like the one above) that just generate clickbait.

Lost money on TSLA today. AMA
there's technology that you can't even imagine that will exist in the next decade, don't even worry about it now, just like we have tech now that was unimaginable 10-15 years ago
Maybe you missed Sept and October.
Thanks - I am not too clue up on the US politics (from the EU) but is that something he actively said he will push for during his campaign, or is it speculations?

Diamond handing these SPY 1DTE's   Order book is skewed to the sell side and but on the flip side the dollar is dropping.
its either TSLA calls or cash, never puts
Wow such amazing earnings
TSLA struggling to break 504.
If Tesla doesn’t show me 550 by tomorrow I’m gonna buy puts
lol for real. Who's looking at that and thinking "Wow what a great buying opportunity"
When you say trade with the market do you mean if its a green day buy calls? Also are you day trading, I saw your loss porn.

GAWD I hate to buy Tesla. I don't know why. It's one of those stocks you buy just because it's going up.    Guess I'm in.
> Here is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.

QE does not remove liquidity. The banks hold loans, reserves, and treasury bills from in their assets. the banks sell their loans to the Fed, the Fed gives them reserves in exchange. the bank t-sheet nets out the same. The reserves from the Fed are equivalent assets to the loans that the bank made. 

On the fed's t-sheet, there is an increase on both sides. they increase the reserves(assets) and they also increase their t-bills(deposits)- this is where the printer comes in, JPow just adds more with his spreadsheet.

Banks don't lend out reserves, they don't lend out deposits. Loans -create- deposits. Coming at the t-chart from the Fed side, the Fed creates treasury bills(assets) and reserves(liabilities), uses those reserves to buy the bank's loans. So every time JPow goes to the printer, he's expanding the monetary base.

But I mostly agree with your gay bear logic on the rest of the parts. There's no liquidity if banks don't lend money, or if consumers don't want to borrow/can't borrow.
Means I am in the right place here
Couldn’t have said it better.

How come i buy fsr calls ecpiring 1/15 and fsr calls expiring 12/12 and the 1/15 lose value but the 12/12 gained value
but with bong rips

Here’s the thing: how likely are these firms to find something, and would it be before the deal goes through?

SE Calls.
Get out while you're ahead
I’d look to see if they had a pump on those days over the past couple years I’m not sure EBay actually makes any announcement on numbers. 

Short term the calls might be fine It’ll take at least a quarter after this takes effect to see the impact to earnings. 

Also possible eBay gets it head out it’s Ass and figures out a solution or delays the payment system.

>Is this also true if you have loans, such as student loans, that are income-based on repayment through the federal government? Meaning if I'm only paying $600 on 250k per month, I should save that cash and not try to pay them off if they will be forgiven with 20 years of payment.

I am not a financial actuary.  Probably pay your loans however it is scheduled, I don't have a clue about what a lot of what you're asking about.

I do know every 30 years, at current inflation, money is worth 50% less, make that work for you however you can.
at the gym it's cool, it's just gimmicky. a regular workout bike with an ipad. i like the motivation aspect and that's it.

TSLA is a company
In bullish on GME and bagholding it but afaik rentech only trades using mathematical models and algorithms. They literally don't hire you if you have a background in economics/finance because they know those people don't actually make money (compared to indexes) on average and almost all if not all their traders/quants/swe have PhDs in unrelated STEMs
You said you believe that Tesla's [fair market value](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=tsla#:~:text=Tesla%20Inc%20(NASDAQ%3ATSLA) is $20 a share, giving a them a 16 billion dollar market cap.  There's no other word to describe that other than retarded.

Most obvious bull flag in history for GME. Two in one day.
You can miss big gains, particularly if you are writing calls on a growth stock. For example, I very stupidly wrote some calls on xpev and li earlier this month. I’m getting assigned for a profit relative to initial purchase price, but way behind where I’d be if I had just held the shares.
You aren’t amazed that someone just dropped $100 on a comment that took you 60 seconds to type out.

I for one am bullish on “EV company” so I’ve added it to my tracker.
I feel like the next red day will wipe out 60% of this sub

why?
Can it just shoot up more so I can get out.
[deleted]
depending what all yall time frames are. tsla good for volatility . you can short but gotta be in and out quick. been looking at AYX, PLTR competitor. it's chart looks good for a month/2 out. i know everyone here pumping BABA but it's chart looks good too, back to 270s next week.

I hold mostly all of mine long term. However, I don’t stonk on Nio so I’m not sure how they look.
isn't rentech purely algos that do quick (closed within days, usually shorter) trades? not sure this means much
People said this like 40 months ago though.
ROCKET INTO CLOSE 🚀🚀🚀🚀
So bored with watching PLTR dance around $18.5
🙏🏼🙏🏼
Yes. But it’s less risky than holding just the stock/option. Because the stock can go down a bit before you start to take a loss since you received a premium for selling the option when you enter the position. The upside risk is that your potential gain is given a hard cap, whereas your potential loss is reduced by the premium received. Use when you think the stock will stay the same or go up slightly, it’s still a bullish strategy.
How fucked are my aapl 1/15 125 calls?
I can only speak from history. But RKT is a solid company. It just doesn’t budge...but it will. I was making 100 day on the Apple swings. I honestly just see what is hot here....and then exit when it’s on blast here.  But one thing I do agree with. RKT 5000 today.  Could be 15k in a year if you can just park it and don’t touch it. Easier said than done. I got lucky on the climb. But also got wrecked. I think CRSR is worthy too.
CHWY come on baby where ya going?

NVDA calls look bretty juicy right now
It seems kinda new and volatile, it’s done some weird shit lately. Holding is risky, maybe cash out and wait for the next dip?
Calls on your mom
Yes, actually, I did my homework. That's the brand that has all the Kendall & Kylie stuff, and Clairol (old lady products). In-store products. Still well below the pre-covid peak of 11 and change. Figured that'd blow up before holidays. Then all these states started announcing shutdowns so I bailed.

Only had 100 contracts ($800) and didn't lose money, but if I'd held for a few days it'd be worth $6500. Sorry son, no PS5 this year.

Tell me GME is gonna actually plummet after ER so I feel better about my 2021 puts.

If the stock goes down enough, sure.

So glad I rolled my TSLA 11/20 to 11/27 on that dip 😏
Don’t underestimate retard strength.

jesus christ. my january 55calls. this is definitely dooming them, should I gtfo or wait a bit for the black friday/cyber monday pump then leave?
This is the fakest SPY green I've ever seen
For sure, I’m usually bullish but I can’t help but feel like the market is running on fumes right now. I’m keeping my pf majority cash.
Only if the underlying asset goes down but that happens whether you sell the covered calls or not, you always collect the premium
Honestly it can't.  It was made for us
Just Hit $24,750 please god just close above 25k so I can be unrestricted. Not a chance tho I already know it

You posted the same thing twice. Different flairs. And only a ticker. No positions. Not call or puts. No dd. Gtfo.
Went up bigly this morning (CRSR calls,  txs Sir-Jacks-a-lot), cashed out everything at the top, and did not immediately FOMO my way back in.  I've been cash gang for nearly two hours now.  WSB, this Autist is growing up! 🎉💖
Are you looking at Asian markets?
I mean you are just throwing random shade out there and I want to change my behavior if I am being annoying

If you don't own SBE get off this sub now!!!
Thanks. I will check them out. 
One Chinese market sector I have got my eye on is chipmaking. Due to international pressure from the US, the Chinese chip industry does not have access to the EUV lithography machines, nor high tech chip makers to take on TSMC. The government is putting a lot of money into developing home grown tech, even buying Chinese chips for their government PCs etc. Could be quite a few interesting opportunities if these firms make it to the US in the form of ADRs.
thats a lot of buy volume, might make the push to 520

Too late for DKNG calls?
Way oversold. And I mean like way oversold.
Pretty much.  There are so many variables at play.  But, then I realize my portfolio is small enough to hedge the entire thing with a single sxps 6/18 $3c So I did that, not really understanding how this etf works leveraged...

Edit : call not put, shit I’m autistic
there has been a tendency in recent years for investment banks bringing company's to market to underprice due to a fear of missing the mark
Chadbay and Docuchad saving me today

Honestly boys, don’t paper hand. Almost all of the trades I’ve paper handed have costed me money. Either i could have come out with less of a loss if i waited even just a couple hours, left a bunch of profit on the table, or worst of all — trades ended up being winners if i had not doubted myself. Trust your gut and give things time. Best of luck. Take smart money’s money right out of their pockets.

There is massive inflation in investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, pokemon cards, cr1pto) 

The only reason inflation is slower on their bullshit CPI indexes is because most of this new money doesn't actually go into the circulating economy (decreasing velocity of money versus total money supply). 

Capital injections will only EVER have a temporary affect on CPI indexes because as that money flows through the consumer -> business -> owner -> tax/wage -> consumer cycle any excess money will be siphoned off into assets. Only way to increase inflation in CPI goods long term is to increase wages or decrease taxes on the middle/lower classes
Bought FCEL calls for April, don’t even know what this company does but these are my longest dated options yet lol

Is this liftoff for real? Or are we about to get cucked by theta gang?
Tesla is offering covered replacements for any effected units, thereby negating any need for a recall.  You could even bring in your car prior to the MCU failing and they would replace the affected ECC chip.  Not withstanding that most people who *could* be effected by this have or will upgrade to MCU2 which does not have this issue (only cars from 2012-late 2017).

Although I can see how this would effect you as a non investor and non owner....
Today flat asf but it’s gonna end with a dump
Well bud. Theta is about to kick in for me. I’m taking my $40 that’s left and buying beer. Been fun.
I wouldn’t say how dumb these people are but more like, how the duck can people this lazy have this much money in the first place. 

It takes 5 minutes of googling/youtubing.

yea, they are part of the banks "assets". However they, the banks, can only use the bank reserves as collateral for loans. And the banks are the most tight they have been since 2008, and barely lending at all, hence they are essentially completely illiquid assets

SPY 360 eow

I bought 3/19 800c's on the 3rd (Nov) for $7.34 because (cue laugh track)  the Schwab trade assessor said they represented the biggest move on a 20% move in TSLA. Sold today for $22.80 because it had grown to too big a % of my portfolio, and there was more return now in rolling up to 900's or 1000. It's a little weird buying at strike prices that I know are impossible, but I  did the same with GM 3/19 55C that I'm still holding, and they're up by a larger % than any of the strike prices below. Seems like the outsized premiums for a lot of these call options makes the real outliers on strike price move more aggressively
I fucking hate this market
Bought my first options this morning pltr 21.5c 11/27 am I fucked?
Same. Me and some friends played it from $12 but I'm out.

No. It adds them to its ‘balance sheet’. Which is why the graph looks like this:

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst\_recenttrends.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm)

See the spike after GFC? Then slow increase to circa 4T. Then the sharp spike this year, now sitting just over 7T.  


 ‘which cannot be used for anything else other than collateral‘ 

Collateral by whom: the Fed or the sellers of the bonds?

520 would be better. I would take 510 though

I’m never going to make up my money with PING. 😢
the iv on TSLA is gross i dont get how you guys are comfortable with playing that.
Where were you when I was putting it in my ex-fiancée.
imagine not buying the 14$ tsla dip.
They are covering up real numbers to have a public reason to open everything again in December so Christmas economy can breathe some cash in the bank.
Reality is Europeans cannot travel within their countries freely and even less think of going abroad. EU is rekt, sad Christmas
Any particular reason why?
P/E is absolutely nuts lmaoooooooooo

Good rec, adding to my buy list
Fucking zoom man bleeding now
these look like long term stocks. need a weekly yolo
All the yes!  QE is not really inflationary or deflationary.  The fact that the banks are not lending is deflationary.  What that means is the fed is pushing on a string.
It seems like the only way to fix the problem is with multiple large economic support packages to create demand.   Without the economic support packages, we’re headed for another depression.  
Great writing I completely concur.  The fact that the market is going up should be a matter of serious investigation.   Whatever is going on there seems exceedingly dubious to me.

Thanks good luck to you on your tendies

Thank you COTY... do we double down?
Yeah honestly looking at their revenues and topline growth they seem vastly undervalued here

Also ew fundamentals
NEW will hit $8.5 after hours, buy class!
Buys are almost always lower vol than panic selling, look back at history tard
I've seen this same thing said for so many SPACs after hyln. I'd say there's high chance you'll be waiting months for this to do anything, it'll probably hover around $11 forever while everything else takes off
THIS seems THE WAY

MSFT and AAPL are less fluctuating than currency
In the first five seconds of seeing this post, I instantly knew you were fucking retarded.

Stocks aren’t overvalued because boomer value investors had tendies of like 20-30% profit margin and that’s like good as fuck to boomer retards.

But this is a new generation where apple has like 70% profit margins etc.,

You can’t value that shit retard. This is a market based around potential, not actual value cause boomers are dying.

DD harder slut.

Seems optimistic considering that DC just had a 100,000 person super spreader event on Saturday. Likely to see another big spike in another week when all the MAGA folks who infected eachother become symptomatic. Another big wave after that when the people they infect at thanksgiving become symptomatic.
All the Chinese EVs have room to grow as the hype spreads to the normcore. They are all close to profitability too (more or less, NIU is actually already turning a profit).

I would buy at a nice strong dip for as long as possible.

You’ll do better when you’re not so emotional about your stock picks.
200 dollars away from running my account from 2500 to 25K with huge loss for me (14k) on the climb (7500 gain on NKLA puts being biggest win)- in about 4 months. Also currently PDT restricted til hopefully tomorrow.

current method that is around 75% successful (and the one I'll stick to) is... yes--buying stocks(on margin) - then using those gains to play options/ memes and yolos. It is very hard to process the FOMO and sit tight while watching breakouts.  Recent Yolo obviously being NIO (which I don't believe will hit 50 til next week) ($4200 gain- 3K greed penalty.)- have exited all positions- too stressful.

Point of post? My own documentation and I Just wanted to throw it out to the miasma of people who get it and just understand sometimes you just need to air it out. It helps to be heard. I'm to scared at moment to make a bigger account because when numbers turn into cars and mortgages I get weird- and I have been wiped clean before (30k loss in a month) 

Anyway.

You might be right in the short term. Markets have run up pretty quick for dumb reasons. But otherwise you're probably mostly wrong. Correlation does not mean causation. Also I find it hard to read your post when it's littered with bias. I appreciate the effort but a shorter more concise post with just more facts and less opinion would be nice. 

The markets recovered quicker than the economy because the major indexes are cap weighted. It's caused a skew. If you look at the russell 2000, you'll see it took a lot longer than the s&p or nasdaq

Yes, but I think you might be forgetting to add that most likely the US government is going to force Tesla to recall over 150k Tesla's affected. The fact that Tesla knew that the infotainment would fail leaving the customer without critical safety features is bad enough. The fact that customers are complaining about it taking over 12 seconds for their backup cameras to appear on the screen and that Tesla service centers are determining that those MCUs are okay and not covered is absurd and scummy!

This is why:

https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/tempted-to-sell-missing-just-a-handful-of-the-best-stock-market-days-can-tank-your-returns/

You have to remember that over a long period of time, things go up. Period. This is because of the nature of life. People LIVE, they work, they earn money, they spend money, they consume, etc. All of this equates to a net increase in *everything*. While there will always be periods of down, the net is always up and if you miss out on those crazy ass makes no sense up days because you’re scared, you’re gonna lose out big. 

In my opinion the best thing is to pick good strong companies with a bright future and go for it. Don’t ever have money in the market that you’ll need to touch in the next 5 years. Feel free to hedge your bets as you see fit by using puts or by taking profits but in general, always have your money in the market so you don’t miss out on the big gain days.

Thanks a whole fucking bunch explaining this simply. I have always felt like I was cheating a system in some way by not being able to afford the actual stock but paying the premium to reserve the right to buy at that price then selling it to some person who can afford it. Then I felt like it's strange to allow people to purchase stock cheaper than it is because the people who can afford to purchase the stock reserved at a lower price could just afford the true price. Making it more stable to a degree. Because there is no speculative price or whatever. But I get it now like this. Still seems like a cheat code if played right. Since people can go from 1,000-1,000,000 without ever actually buying stock

Been working from home since February and we were just told that it will last at least until June 2021.

Are people mostly back to offices or working from home?
I think with it going to arrival it will be another tesla but in the delivery field it has had a order that is more tangible aswell than paving a guys driveway.
But isn't the stock still undervalued long-term?  People buying during the dip of all dips makes sense for long plays.
You do realize he isnt the real steven right?
I like loss porn
im reversing WSB and buying 1 day SPY calls.  Showing short term support actually.
🤡🤡🤡
Now THAT is a wasted investment if I ever saw one, and I burned up a call for SPCE yesterday that turned green today.
So whats the next play, rode this baby to 100% gains on stocks today, sold half my position. Still have the same spreads you recommended a month ago except I extended them out to 20-30s

Tell us your position
That is correct.  Of course anything could happen at any time with GME, I'm deep in calls/shares because I don't want to miss the train if it starts early.  The dec earnings could definitely start the major run, but its possible we may not kick off until the Q4 ER in march.

Cohen sent a letter to the board monday.  The articles are a little confusing and more bearish, but the letter itself reads as "fix these things or else," and includes the phrase "I won't be happy with a single board seat (which they have offered him)."  He amended his 13D with it as well, which indicates he may be using it as a cover to avoid a lawsuit if he forces a board vote that kicks off a short squeeze.

He also requested a full public review of the strategic plan, which would likely happen by Dec ER.  They are in the quiet period, so they may not do anything before that...but a strat plan would include talking about what they are doing now, and they would be trying to make it look good so he doesn't take actions against them - so we'd hear about all the good things happening with the console release.

TLDR, good things happening during the ER in dec probably.  Strong chance Cohen pushes for a major stake and control of the board, or makes a buyout offer.  He referred to current management as dinosaurs, so it isn't a stretch to think he would want the CEO spot - especially when you look at what he has said in past interviews.  Oh and he hired one of the best law firms in the country for activist investors/M&A/tender offers

Jan 21 2020 $20 calls 10/10.70

if you're happy with your gains you should sell
One thing you fail to realize is that FED intervention in the Agency MBS market is more important than their Treasury activities. When they buy MBS the cash doesn't go into reserves; it is injected directly into the investment sphere.

How do I convert my Reddit karma in Robinhood money?
Here is the way to think about subprime in relation to 2008 -

Soo much appreciation was happening in a short period of time that you would buy your house with 0% down and the appreciation would cover your mortgage and you refi out and the appreciation was your down payment. It’s all good and dandy. 

But this is making a long term investment require short term appreciation. And when that stopped you had to either liquidate or have cash.  Well people didn’t have cash soo tons of homes were repoed and liquidated. 

The value of real estate is kind of based on a lack of liquidity. As Homes go on the market homes are worth less and people freaked out and then everyone was fucked unless you had cash. 

In theory if you have the cash to own, you should buy as much real estate as possible with debt. Not full cash purchases too obtain this increase across multiple properties with the ability to bail yourself out with cash.

There's still the [TINA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tina-there-no-alternative.asp) problem which you haven't really addressed. Everyone is still sitting on boatloads of cash, looking for somewhere to get a return. With interest rates at 0, there's nothing else to do but put it in the market. You can't just sit on cash because you lose it to inflation. Stocks aren't actually very overvalued once you look at their valuations relative to bond returns.

This is why every dip gets bought up within days, sometimes within hours, and why there won't be another crash unless we start to see runaway inflation and the Fed is forced to raise rates.

For most people their homes are their main equity. That was the difference. This economic situation is a reallocation (the money from fixed income, commodities, etc. had to find somewhere to rest) but this is not equivalent to an actual collapse (that is, an asset class falling apart from the bottom up like real estate did) and so for instance if the largest banks go to zero on all the mortgages in the United States and abroad that is a huge problem.

SQ lifting off!
This stock is volatile, so there will be plenty of opportunities to invest one one of the dips. I might even add more if it dips, currently holding 200 shares.

Come on lads, let's bump SBE back to $25!!!

>No person with any financial sense would actually do that, you're far better off not doing that and investing and paying your mortgage like normal and keeping the leverage because of how inflation works. You want to have debts to pay off with future, fundamentally less worth, money.

Is this also true if you have loans, such as student loans, that are income-based on repayment through the federal government? Meaning if I'm only paying $600 on 250k per month, I should save that cash and not try to pay them off if they will be forgiven with 20 years of payment.

Sold some puts after it's earnings shit show. Wish I bought shares

Why don’t you just do what I do and take your gains, pay off bills. Set aside what you initially invested to invest more.  Can’t lose that way.

1. For a battery to have the range of a gas tank it would have to be bigger than the car. Ergo, all current EVs are shorter range and the batteries are bulky and expensive.

2. For a given amount of horse power an electric engine is much heavier and more expensive.

3. Much of this cost is due to the exotic and volatile metals used.

4. A lot of homes don't have covered garages. This rules out many potential buyers. Also, exploding batteries is a thing.

5. All this is not as green as you think. First because many coal and gas power plants built almost a century ago still work. Also, mining exotic metals is fundamentally dirty even ignoring greenhouse gas stuff, and a lot of the countries mining don't care about going green just for getting greenbacks.

6. Gas engines have gotten more efficient over time. For instance, they're using thinner oils now to reduce internal friction.

The bottom line is EV will not overtake gas until some fundamentally new way of storing/using energy is found. Maybe later this decade something in quantum physics will open up, but the gap between theoretical science and industrial application is about 20 years.
All the dips are being bought
They unironically were through Blackrock
The capitalization of a company means shit in the short term if the government forcibly shuts down their business. Many Chilli and Shake Shake restaurants are located within shopping malls, if the malls are forcibly closed by the state governments so will the restaurants inside them. I fully expect the entire restaurant industry to tank over the next 3 to 4 months, until vaccine availability allows states to rescind draconian measures.  At that time, you will see a massive rebound on companies which have the characteristics you describe. Going long on restaurant stocks right now, when they are at all time highs but on the verge of disaster is absolutely retarded.
No, niu is a chinese ev scooter company that actually has a lot of room to grow. Many people in china are choosing ev scooters over ev cars.

Congrats but dude this is something that can drop 20 points in a day.
Our school hosted him and Michelle Bachman back in 2005ish. He was on some book tour and she was the local conservative bitch. I wanted to boo them so badly, but the principal basically said anybody who acted up would be expelled.

We also had to sign petitions to allow an LGBTQ+ club to have a room after school. We got the signatures and the school board didn’t allow it, but they allowed a bible study group in a public school. Fuck that school.
Please I just need baba $300+ eoy
We can only hope.

sell
such boring days
GM didn’t even mention NKLA
Post a pic of your lifetime P/L
BABA is back!
Why is the “historical trend line” flat? This is impossible as there is always a net production. People work, people earn money, a flat trend line cannot exist unless production ceases.
That’s i nice one, op! 
The timing etc was perfect. 

I really got to see that movie again.
There was a lot of speculation. Now there’s legitimacy to the pump. Pullback is a bit further out, so it will happen, but not sure about 34%.

I appreciate you giving your view. Looking forward to reading about your next trade. I'm about 5% down on my  275 March 2021 calls as of this moment.
I think it'll hit 200 again by Jan at the latest. Seems to have lost some steam today though. Maybe we'll see 193 by EOD but no telling

That's not what his reply suggests at all. The point is the fact that some lawyers are investigating in itself doesn't mean anything either way
With more covid restrictions kicking in combined with Christmas PTON seems like it’s due for a run
As a heads up from a guy who has been trading for over 20 years and timed the feb crash correcty.

The stock market always has 5 very likely things ready to crash it. Always. Seriously every single year of the last 20 years their have been at least 5 very plausible things ready to cause a 10-20% drop.  And it has happened a few times. Generally most of the things don't cause the big impact they predict.

That said at 50 years old, and the high volatility; my retirement is mostly out of the market, just not an older mans game right now. We got nothing else to invest in with safe returns; so a little stability from Biden and good news can get a bunch of $$$ back in the market. Sell now you miss that.
LFG baba 🚀🚀
Nope. Got puts thinking it would tank soon with record cases, it just keeps rising. I don't see it stopping any time soon.
You mean Antifa riots? Or are you really that dumb?
Spy *has gone* down.

This does not mean spy is *going* down.

Are my BABA 270c's bought on the lunchtime dip going to be ITM EOD?
are we though
Thats fair, let’s hope it doesnt happen right away, otherwise people will get fucked in the ass
I guarantee you many TSLA traders are kicking themselves watching the other EV stocks kill it while their stock only stopped sinking because it was being added to the S&P 500. Just wait and see how many now will be taking profits & rolling them into other EV companies that have room to run instead of a company that will have to grow into its current valuation for the next 10 years
Don't count on a sustained dip in this company.

Palantir is only being called a "meme stock", because retards are making memes about it. That makes the memers idiots, not Palantir.

They are actually an extremely solid company, with a very very good leadership team.

Literally their only risk is Joe Biden and the Dems, and in my view, I think Biden will continue doing business with them.

Maybe I will sell my position in Intel and buy another 200 share but I don't have more money.

Are you from USA?

Bag hold until it pops? It doesn’t seem to be getting the no news jumps of Ayro or solo .

My theory is that people are Leary of Fisker after the last failure. I would take leaps on it if you were playing options (I can’t yet). I’m personally bought up on its stock for the long term expecting more jumps early / mid next year as them and Magna hit delivery milestones.

I was looking for something like this 😂
4.5 billion - 5 billion market cap is not impossible for CRSR.  That would give it a price target of 46-54 dollars.  I don't know if it'll be by the end of the year, but its not impossible.
ive been faked out by baba and amazon so much that ive got trust issues now

Of course, the timing though, idk. Buy stocks or leaps.
MNKKQ It's a company about to go under.  I'm just super  curious what if anything would happen if they threw 100k at it.

Hey BABA is alive. Still -90% though
I’m holding calls overnight
1:27 pm 11/19/2021- I'm adding a few positions as I type this, a couple already closed. They are:

GrowGeneration (GRWG) $40c Jan 15 2021 & 35c, same date.

MP Materials (MP) $17.5c Jan 15 2021 & $22.5c March 19 2021.

Cinemark (CNK) $22.5c June 18 2021

I will be buying shares of MP and GRWG too, not just options. Options only for Cinemark tho, I'm not interested in putting capital towards them for longer than the date of the call, I can use the money elsewhere in places that will move faster. Cinemark will go back up tho in the next few months once the vaccine is released.
Yes market please rise on all the great news about lockdowns and Covid. Thanks. Appreciate it!!
What was that lmfao
I didn’t hear what the GM CEO said, I assume it’s good news for NKLA put holders?
Is SPCE done? lol
Fsr due for another pump... aaaannny day now
sw till due date
They mitigate risk for the seller.

Let's say I have a side hustle making umbrellas.  They bodega owner who buys them thinks the season is going to be rainy, so he wants to order 200 umbrellas.  He's scared that the season may be dry though, so I offer to sell him an option contract.

I say he can reserve 200 umbrellas for a 10% fee.  If the season is dry, he only loses that 10% instead of the huge amount he would have lost being unable to sell the umbrellas.

I, as the umbrella maker, still get 10% instead of nothing in the event of a dry season.

Furthermore, if the season were rainy my umbrellas would be in high demand, driving up the price. By paying 10% to reserve the umbrellas at a locked-in price, he simultaneously reduced the risks of a dry season and a rainy season through the option contract while increasing the profit margin in the event of a rainy season.
Thanks chief stay up

I obviously know there are tools are out there, just giving a PSA that retail interest was a legit indicator written about pretty extensively in academic research & that the source that almost all professional investors used to gauge retail interest was recently shut down.
So on the typical NINJA loans that we hear about in the financial crisis, it was the house which was held as collateral?
Consumer spending is shifting toward in-home purchases. That means a lot of movie watching, theatre system upgrades etc. guaranteed we are not out of the woods yet with the pandemic.
How dare PLTR behave like a regular stock and rise within reason.
Does anyone how CRSR performs on Friday?
Rudy is such a Critter

Nah, it’s doing what I thought it would. Flounder around 18.5...
C 52c 11/20 GM 44c 11/27 DKNG 50c 12/4. Also add WWR to your watchlist , could really boom off some news. They have all the US EV battery-grade graphite.

IIVI aswell it's juicier
diamond handing CCL 16 puts has not panned out so great hahahhaah, still fucking pissed at the boomers holding this shit stock tho
I thought that at first too. But covid didn't affect the healthcare sector, public workers, etcetc.  Mostly the service/hospitality industry, small business and low minimum wage earners. All of the people i know who shop at Costco are still working and arguably doing better. No commute, spending less etcetc
They are just making it seem so bad with the economy shutting back down while everyone in the market is bullish
It’s going to get buried but I appreciate this information. I’ll save this post and read it over again it’s that great.
Damn, carry on then
its ok PLTR , u can go when ur ready :)   


atleast ur staying in the 18s bby
What did COTY do to Rudy's head?
Why are we so obsessed with soros all of a sudden? I thought bill gates was the chip injecting pyramid eye thingy guy?

BABA you magnificent bastard. Should have never doubted you
If you have calls next week you should be solid. Relax
Yeah, not a great play from a guy bag holding intel. It’s the most bland, flat stock out here

All of those things, but it's hard to remember back that far.

Did the exact same thing, feelsbadman
I agree. It’s almost like he’s making it up as he goes along. He even threw in Antifa lol
people are surprised  PLTR isn't mooning? that's impossible because it's being spammed so much here on wsb that means it should moon!
If you weren't so scared you could have had 500k.

Nio earnings hurdle officially cleared.  Next stop Nio Day and tendie town 🍻🚀🌕
Actually what I'm doing too, I wasnt very specific about it in my last comment. I pay for professional stock analysis and buy leap calls on undervalued companies when I see volume spikes. Once I'm tempted to sell, I sell a near expiry otm call instead, with my leap as collateral. Once my leap is near 60 dte or when the stock hits its fair value I look for an exit. I just started doing this strategy this week so I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. I wouldnt want all of wsb at this IQ level, what would be the fun in that?!
How many of you are losing money on $19 pltr calls tomorrow?
I’d agree w u that a dilution is imminent but they literally just diluted and musk has the upper hand here. He let’s this run way up before diluting

>	To be sure, the best available evidence from countries that have reopened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risks to school-aged children – at least in areas with low community transmission. That said, the body of evidence is growing that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-7) and, contrary to early reports (11, 12), might play a role in transmission (7, 13, 14).

Even the cdc changed its guidelines.  The same cdc that said kids can go back to school.  But you’re prob an antimasker who just wants stonks to go up so what do you care

There are significant trades today in this particular strike. The worst you're looking at is probably $3.20 -> $1.60 if you sell at 10 AM tomorrow. The upside could be 5x. Not a bad trade if you're a degenerate.

How are you tards buying the premiums on these calls? It's outrageous. You'll need it to moon to make any tendies with huge risk

wtf this is gonna give me nightmares seriously
You fucking called it bro!!! I LOVE YOU
I mean sure. Basically, you can sell your stocks now and wait for the dip or ride out the dip. No one on this sub, myself included, has enough patience for that. 

CRSR is probably going to get shorted at some point. I want to try and time a sell before it does and load up again. I probably won't be able to do that, so the next strategy is change my password to Etrade and forget it for a few months.

I’m old enough to remember Ackman freaking the hell out of CNBC back in March. Now he’s bullish? Dude either has no stones or is just acting as a shill
Mary Barra's Fargo accent is kinda hard to listen to.
My point is that they spew bullshit and then when its time to pony up in court theyre caught with their pants around their ankles. Pretty clear.
If I keep adding money to my account my losses go down! What a neat trick!!
This shit just makes me want to move deep into the woods and buy guns lol
I mean me personally

Did Rudy just say Maduro in Venezuela, George Soros teamed up to count our votes?

It is better to have debt and assets, than no debt and 1 asset.
There's this awkward tension driven by political correctness--  
\-The economy will melt up into next year with or without covid, yet everyone must acknowledge the gravity of the pandemic--being overly bullish makes one sound like a jack ass.

Sounds all well and good but have you ever tried sitting cash and not playing anything and continuously living in a cycle of regret for the plays you didn't make?
This won’t be the case by 2024, and it’s still cost effective for industrial business that can’t stop to charge. 
Seems like a lot of people are confused about this. Batteries are great when you are going to one destination, then going home. But what if you need equipment to run 24 hours a day? 

This means: 

For equipment (This is why amazon and Walmart use hydrogen for their green warehouses):

(Cost of electricity/HR x Uptime) + (Net loss of down time/HR x charge time) > (Cost of green hydrogen/HR) 

This equation is how a business determines whether hydrogen is better for their commercial activities. This will be the case for ALL hydraulic equipment where the cost of downtime costs and electricity costs more the green hydrogen. This is why PLUGs entire plan revolves around producing more green H2.
They only go down, so that they can come up

Fingers crossed for 50 tomorrow
I don’t get it... 🥺
Think im just gonna put my money into a house lol
You can't go broke taking out your initial investment + 50% and then keeping on with your gains.  I did that with my initial investment and now I have well over 100% more in my accounts.
Scalping some 1DTE spy puts right here.  Close at 353-352.

What’s your point?

How is baba looking?!
The fed buys bonds off our government who can issue however many bonds they want, and that's how we get "BRRR".  That's what funded our trillions in stimulus.  Since you don't think the fed is printing any money (btw hello steven van metre), how do you explain the M2 money supply dramatically increasing this year?

Everything you said here is right.  But the market doesn't give a fuck.  It was just flooded with money and valuations, fundamentals, and the state of poor people are irrelevant now.  The world goes to shit next year and the market keeps pumping imo.
Huge bid volume on those 11/20 55c @ 1.10, we mooning soon?

How do you guys feel about Tesla puts tomorrow?
Oh fuck it’s you 😒
well if you have shares and you're up a lot you probably want to wait till it's not gonna be taxed as short term
I never ever want to hear again that markets don't like uncertainty or the efficient market hypothesis.

Holy shit Rudy.  

This is getting nuts
A lot of oil/gas exploration are trading below where they were in March, so I have a feeling that quite a few have losses priced in. Still think it could be an interesting play however.

Cus we have 11/20 calls 💀
Serious question for SBE. I want to long term hold but thinking of setting a stop limit for 50% gains and rebuying if it dips hard. Is that logical here? Or do we think it will maintain the rally
This fucking site is going to be the death of me
Oh good, I can be even less nice.
I started recently with a similar amount but haven't found as much luck.

What tactics or instruments have you found most profitable because those gains are impressive!
Anyone else holding onto EAR? Not sure if I wanna hold through earnings since the prospectus says they’ve been having trouble meeting demand but they have had 80%YoY growth. Could go either way

Ok free advice for all those new money PLTR retards. This is the part where the FOMO is cooling off and the big boys are slowly selling off the last few Fomoers. Don’t be left holding the bags. I’ve been around and seen this shit happen dozens of times
I wish I sold my shares off during any of the run ups.  Watching it drop from 4.20 to 1.50 during the beginning of the pandemic was hard
Whooosaaaaa
Couple months, I’m retarded but will they be exercised or just expire worthless and I’ll be down what I am now?
So what ur telling me is buy 5 500c 11/20's?

It seems like he believes the market is acting irrationally, so predicting when the market will rationalize and "crash" is probably really difficult.

Give me some puts. What are your positions?
Why?
Today or tomorrow?
Reality is there’s going to be euphoria over vaccines, new president, stimulus, but I expect that euphoria to last longer than what OPs timeline is. December? We’ll still be in COVID era idealizing the earnings in a post Covid world. 

If the bubble bursts — if — it will be once we finally start seeing signs of normal life with the vaccine and then the market decides that it’s all been priced in when post Covid era earnings can’t meet the expectations priced during Covid.
if i double my account within this year, Ill put 50k down on a gallardo and finance the rest.

Premise 4 is deeply flawed. QE does not remove liquid assets from the market. If those assets were actually liquid then the Fed wouldn’t have to buy them. They’re buying them because no one else wants to, thus making illiquid assets into liquid assets.

It's sell time. It's incrementing up while most other EV stocks are soaring in double digit gains for multiple days. And the only reason it's inching up right now is that it was added to the S&P. People are going to start selling very quickly if NKLA holders start posting gain porn.

The date on an option contract is when it expires. Any time before that date, you can either 

exercise the contract (call: buy the stock, put: sell the stock) 

or sell the contract.

What are your metrics for "performance"? A Tesla Model 3 performance edition does 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds for $55k (and that's before the economic savings of "filling up" off your home's electricity rather than at a gas station). That's pretty high performing for the pricepoint.

Well, you see, the SP is now already under what you bought it for. Not saying it won't go back up soon, but I'd really be careful if I were you. This thing might go up a bit more in the next few days but it will eventually go back down like all other SPACs until the merger is confirmed and is going to happen soon (few weeks max.). GL

Except your analogy doesn’t make sense and your opinion doesn’t make sense. There are reasons outside of “conviction” or lack of to choose a higher strike price. That’s all you’re hung up on. The reality is OP makes good money at 350p or 325p if the market drops huge.

PLTR IV still really high. When’s a good time for calls?  Next dip?
>Just these two funds will need more than $12B of TSLA shares to get their AUM to reflect the new S&P accurately.

You need to adjust for the fact that if the buying pressure pushes the price up, then the shares already being held increase in value, somewhat reducing the need for shares they would otherwise have to achieve proper weighting.
If you made money, don't feel bad.

5 minutes after I sold 14 TSLA 520c 12/04/20 they were worth 5k more. Im still fuckin happy

I was heavily contemplating buying options this past Monday...I really regret not doing and selling my KNDI calls for a measly $88 profit which would have been $3k+ today.
Made 2k in 9 minutes today buying 5x 500C and selling once it hit 560.50.  Just a quick momentum trade cause I had some capital just sitting there.  It's holding around $500 very strong, once it breaks 510 it's gonna gap up and find a new support level above 500.
People like you were saying the FED would be buying ETFs in June.
People talking shit about NIO and their December $80 calls are up bigly
This chick ain’t it. Bring back the thick one.
Hope you right brotha I’m clinching my asshole
💎 🖐
Calls on COVID
Puts on which ones?
Baba up $5
OP wrote CIIG in the picture but CIIC in the title.
I'm not sure which to buy ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

Fuck it, imma YOLO both
lock in earnings before Bidens tax plan implementation
Good time for PLTR calls or wait for dip?
I bought 2 July 300C this morning
The Earth is flat! The Moon landing was fake! Lizard people!!!!

Jesus someone give her a beta-blocker she's fucked up
This tesla train is scary fast, worried about a crash, also worried about getting off before my stop at Bugatti boulevard
Buzzfeed News is legitimate though. You have to separate them from entertainment. 

It’s like the Fox journalists and the Fox pundits.
Thanks someone gets me
11/20 18c and 12/4 17c where the rocket at?
That was the dip to buy. It was postponed for reasons out of their control.
Nope, no idea how the stock price will move in the near term. Long term the stock is bound for the moon tho. Their outstanding  revenue growth, profit margins, and opportunities to be a major player in AI hardware makes them my number 1 long-term position.
Who else bought high and sold low today?
Good time for PLTR calls or wait for dip?
Rest in pieces
I’m in 1000 shares

I DUNNO ALL MY SAVINGS ARE THERE
Every other comment is about TSLA but I’d take a million more over the god awful NIO spam we ensured this weekend
neither
what date are you targeting? June?
You didn't plot the rEjEcTioNs at the dips either.
I agree it's ambitious. Up 25% from when I posted though, so that's something.

what would Boardroom Jimmy do?
Wait until you hear this 99% GME vaccine been producin'. You dont ever go outside.
Thanks for doubling down on your ignorance and lack of reading comprehension.  I didn't type "electric vehicle" - I specifically typed "EV".  Using nouns like "cars" as modifers to acronyms like "EV" is something taught in places called schools.  Schools are places available to the kids that don't get expelled for incessantly licking the windows, so I can understand your confusion.

I'm surprised tsla isn't doing more, once it's past 5 it's gone
Lol @ the guy on FOX news pointing out that Trump is wrong
Why is taking profit so hard?
Yeah I'd fuck her, the woman speaking not the blonde
Oh, okay sorry, I honestly thought they were somehow involved with that. But main point remains, they do more than just EV
I did a monumental fuck up yesterday. Closed a GoodRx credit spread and tried to roll down but there were no open interest on lower strikes so I’m like I’ll just roll with Walgreens since Amazon news is moving them in sync and Walgreens is bigger, more liquid...... 

WBA still going down and GoodRx up 11% today. I am a clown 🤡🤡🤡
You're absolutely right, maybe i'm looking at it in short term and you are looking at it in long term. I absolutely hope that, under Biden, the US will commit to full green energy but i'm not convinced atm... its a slow process and in short term the dilution is detremental for shareholders.. but you do have a point, their options are somewhat limited atm.

Fucking FOX is cutting this bitch out. So should everyone else. What a fucking joke.
Puts on your kid
This is not a good week to expect banter on stocks that aren't NIO, PLTR, DKNG, or TSLA.
make it stop
Absolutely no manipulation occurring on ES/SPY - its completely normal to bounce back and forth 5 points up then down multiple times - this is because people can't decide whether to go long or short so they keep buying and selling... Yep - makes sense. Clown market - all in on TSLA
It’s the bears that are gay Alex. How many times we need to go over this?
*He sold?*
OP ain’t really Steven lol. That’s a lot of words you used to be dead wrong there bud
u should make 10% now its 503?

Wish i bought JMIA at 15 last week
rudy sweating like he guilty
I honestly thought it was just for style before, but after looking it up it’s no assets
"NINJA" loans weren't open and uncollateralized. At no point in recent banking (50+ years) could you just walk into a bank and tell them to give you money. You had to have some kind of collateral. The strength of that collateral is what was misunderstood (much like stonks always go up, land always apprezziates) but not the idea itself.
CIIC cliff diving
we're just going to keep going in circles here

My opinion is that if you're expecting something this big in the market and still playing it safe, you're not confident in your own analysis
$ENR a value trap at this price ?
LOL... He had hair dye sweat running down the side of his face. I will never take anything about this country seriously again.

TSLA time for you to go back up to $690 again. I need it. My kid needs it. 

If it doesn’t happen, I’m going to have to sell my kid to buy more FD’s.

So please just go back up to $690. Preferably in the next 15 minutes because I’m impatient. EOD is fine too.

To summarize some crayon eater's TA: if it goes up, it is likely to go up more. If it goes down, it's possible that it goes down more as well.

I think the anti trust could benefit alibaba since exclusivity deals benefit their competitors more. Think about twitch and how mixer and fb gaming tried to gain market share by signing exclusive deals with streamers.

2 the moon
Bought 400 shares with an avg $22.80. Sold  OTM CC for a month or or so. finally sold OTM CC at $21 before earnings and it crept up over $21 and I let it expire. Broke even overall.  Bought some other stocks that have actually moved up, couldn't be happier finally free of the sideways walk. I think everyone was disappointed that RKT did not offer a dividend. You can't keep piling up cash and not give it out to the investors.
i believe tsla ATH is around 530

It's all speculation obviously but because of the SEC and DOJ subpoenas people think whatever is uncovered could be enough to make GM sever ties. I'm not a fan of the company either but personally I'm bullish only because it's been months since the fiasco and GM hasn't already cut ties and the December 3rd deadline for the deal is fast approaching. That being said I wouldn't be surprised if it all fell apart either

Like yes there’s been rejection and overvalue but my premise is the bond bucket looks shitty as rates stay near nil for awhile so that bond bucket will continue to jump into equity I see one more rally with stimulus as catalyst then top

Why is PSTH always pinned to a price? Was $23.20 for a week, then $23.90 for days and days, then $24.90, now pinned to $23.90 again.
Its retracement dude. Very rarely will a high volume stock rise sharply and keep rising. It's how people momentum trade and then short at the high. Buying back in at the retracement levels. If I had bigger balls I could have made an extra 16k today doing this... 

But my balls are empty from all the shagging I've been doing...

Stay humble kings. Little bit gains, little bit profit. If you don't know what you would do with a hundred bagger tomorrow, then you have time to spare.
Conclusion: Virtually the same excuses provided just a different year. had this post title been  "...we are headed up folks."  it would have got a few thumbs up.  That's right son.

This is exactly why the market keeps going up.  IF everyone was long like in 2000.... we'd be in a bubble.  Amazon was a bubble stock at $200... and if everything is a bubble.. is it really a bubble or that fact that all boats are rising.

The economy is not the stock market.  The FED may not be able to openly PRINT money... but money supply - yes the amount of money in circulation HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER....  never!! and its a coordinated effort around the globe.

Money has neve been cheaper.  Mortgage rates at an all time low.  Central Banks hell bent on keeping their feet on the gas pedal.  The government ready to dole out more money to everyone.  You could surely craft a bearish perspective.  No doubt.

However we got the worst economic disaster of our lifetimes.  And the stock market rallied to to new record highs.

Exclamation point.  end of sentence.
Still limping
We all know they'll just be another vaccine announcement on Sunday night and this thing will open at 364 Monday morning
Need TSLA to stay above 495 by tomorrow EOD
TSLA worth more than Berkshire. Get rekt Buffett. Imagine spending 900 years to build your fortune on value plays only to be surpassed by a Battery Man.
Feds printing money go BRRRR
Nice gains, you shit fuck.
I’m a scared little boy who’s lost too much money already, I’m gonna hold though
So in summary, you are saying we need to buy SPY calls. Thanks
One of the dumbest things I see on WSBs is bearish posts telling us how dumb retail investors are the only ones being bullish/buying stocks. If you think the totality of retail investors are exclusively or are the majority reason driving stock growth you're a fucking moron. Hedge funds and banks are constantly shifting around tens of billions worth of instruments every day. When (eg) Tesla booms like it did this week it's because hedges are buying collosal fuck tons of stock and calls, probably to cover short positions. Big money makes huge plays all the time and that's what drives markets.
Would I be crazy to buy $CRSR calls today or wait for a dip?
Not til next week boy
I doubt that
But I can sleep so well, so its worth it 🥰
Why poopoo? It is

I guess if we're comparing, we'd have to add a percentage of the solar, roofing and fuel industry also? Since they have the largest charging network and manufacture solar panels, batteries and ruffs.

Hey dad, are you making money?
You mean the 12k MCU units, out if 1 million, that Tesla has covered regardless of warranty status?

Yup completely agree, people think they have a lot of cash, but it’s expensive to keep growing, especially as musk have a lot of vision and plan to keep going, hence the priced in growth expectations. Also lot more competitions are popping up now, which might force him to grow even faster to take the market cap over quickly. I think i’m done with TSLA For now, there’s a lot of other companies that have potential jumps lining up other than TSLA. Or if they raise more capital i might buy back in after that, it’s a solid long term hold i still believe, just quite risky for short term.

No math needed. It is basic SPAC process. Shares convert 1 to 1 ratio so 1 if they evaluated the company based on $10 price, it will double at $20.

Fuck Burry he has actual autism. Cohen is going to hostile takeover GME. The letter was a formality, he’s actively ignoring them evidenced by his refusal to take a board seat. His letter is a vote of no confidence and he’ll continue taking majority shares after the disclosure made it look like he’s going to hang on to 9-10% 

Bashing the company during a pivotal sales period is a short trap. He specifically called out the shorts as a signal that he’s going to squeeze them.

So, as someone who is too lazy to do their own DD, can you tell me why this stock is a buy?  I saw their EPA was -$.94 when it was projected to be $.02, which was slightly concerning.  What do they do?  Who is who are their customers?  Why does everyone on WSB have such a hard-on for PLTR?
it is

AGRX is a women's pharma company that just completed their FDA trials on a contraceptive patch. No more daily pills, no more IUDs, just slap a bitch on and no babies.  I caught a falling knife hard with their shares when there was a rumor they weren't going to be approved, still pissed that the last 500 shares @ $0.35 didn't go through before trading was halted.  

They've been dicking around between $2 and $4 for the past year and are finally getting Twirla out on the shelves this quarter.  Oppenheimer has the highest price target of $12, the rest average around $7.50 (currently sitting at $2.80)
Get the best of both, 12/4 600c. They´re cheap.

why do you think when it finally merges that it will dip? i feel the exact opposite. after todays and maybe tm's run up, i think we dip until merger then explode, but im retarded so...
Until it boom shots and lose out on the sweet tendies in the future
AAPL leaps lookin like a snac 😘
ev so bullish
Also premiums on VXX are relatively flat across strikes, for instance you can buy something like a 40 and sell a 54 for roughly 70c debit. So 1400 max gains potentially for $70 in risk.
You've been saying that for a 6 months

Don’t ruin my INCEL comment!!! Lol
wolf of wall street type afternoon now
They’ve done other things outside of dilution. Green bonds will become more prevalent as they continue to reach and exceed their price targets. 

We also have to note that the US is fully committed to moving to fully green energy, and Biden especially majorly supports the hydrogen infrastructure being developed. 

If we want commercial industry to be fully green, hydrogen has to be an option. Charging the batteries on machines required for large scale supply chain operation is just strait up not an option. Aerospace also has to move into green energy too, and green hydrogen once again is the only available strategy that can instantly fuel jets like they do today. 
You can’t leave a revenue generating 25 million dollar asset on the ground for five hours to charge up, it’s not financially viable at all.  

I would expect large government subsidies, and additional financing options gaining traction as they continue to execute, which they are.
[removed]
Holy fuck the Mango administration is so desperate and pathetic. Fuck these guys, I am not even American but I hope they get fucked with their conspiracies and the trash they talk about.
Would going all in on Tesla calls be a dumb play right now. Or do y’all think we will have a big red day for discounts soon?
FOMO into TSLA like a goon but thankfully I had a day trade and could push out to next week.

See this is where we just differ on our opinions, because if your entire post preaches that the sky is falling and the market is more inflated than it's ever been, your positions, IN MY OPINION, would be a little more aggressive than puts one month out at a -$5 strike point. 

If you think you're right in OPs case, you don't have to bet your mortgage the market blows up, but it's like saying a tsunami is about to hit and your preparation is to go get your floaties.

I'm not arguing against his logic, I'm saying his positions don't indicate his sentiment. 

OP literally says "market crash" and when pushed to talk about timing, he says "2 months tops" but his positions don't line up with that logic. 

His DD looks really good, I'm not arguing against that. I'm saying that his positions don't make sense. He's saying a tsunami is about to hit while getting his floaties out.
Well maybe it is not that crazy after all...can you imagine the outcome, if it ends up being true.

>I am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go

That was a very long winded way of coming out of the closet and I'm sure your dad still hates you and thinks you're a disappointment because you wore a dress to prom "for kicks".  No one is surprised that you're gay, however we*are* a little surprised that you aren't still sucking dick behind Wendy's.  That was a solid job, and you had to throw it away, it had the damn fringe benefit of providing you with filling meals 16 times a day as well.  Your mom and I doubt we'll ever see you reach those same heights again.

Now here you are trying to convince everyone that you're into stocks, but we all remember the kid that gave other kids a Klondike bar each to stick a piece of rebar up your ass.  At least the human society took your dog away finally, I couldn't stand the thought of what you were doing to that poor thing.

We don't want you home, but we also don't want to have to read nonsense like this again, your mother and I feel it's probably for the best if you just go live at a farm upstate.  You'll have plenty of room to run and you'll probably meet other degenerates like yourself there.
Sure, my money for your reddit username.

As a principle, it's a sound principle. Obviously now is risky to enter. Harvest your gains and leave some on the sidelines. OP did a great job with his analysis. These posts are rare on here and it has some good indicators on where we could be heading. As for crashing big time, that remains to be seen. If jobs get better over the next few months we could avoid a major crash and see more of a market correction. The problem with these sort of analyses, however logical they are, the market has been all but logical over the past year or more.

Me:  Hey mrDoctor, I need to use emergency anti-retriviral because I wanna engage in unprotected sex and don’t want to use a condom. 

Doctor: No 

Me: but please I might get HIV! 

Doctor : how about you just use a condom? 

Me: but it’s been approved!! 

Doctor: it’s for healthcare workers who are accidentally exposed to HIV/hep , or rape victims. 

Me: but but but... [Anonymous unprotected sex] is a right! 


Now replace anonymous unprotected sexual with a travel business of your choice.



And you know what. I bet if there were enough regards who knew that HIV anti retrivirals are a thing if administered soon after, there’d be quite a bit of abuse.

No, I would buy puts just like OP said. Maybe read the fucking post more closely. $350 SPY puts give you cushion to see how the market reacts AFTER the dump. Maybe it’ll dump further, maybe it’ll bounce back rapidly. Either way, you’re ITM.

Sounds like a lot of gay bear talk, stocks only go up.
More like he's arguing for a market crash but understands he doesn't know everything, no one knows what will actually happen.

There are many reasons to not buy puts 3 months out right now, no matter his predictions.  

You're arguing against someone providing good information because you think they didn't "bet hard enough".  Calm down dude

The REAL problem is that there is a lack of credit worthy demand.  Fed can drive interest rates as low as it wants but that isn't going to give joe six pack a better credit score

So after all this DD which you've got such conviction over, you're still timing "hoping to get lucky" and have a pathetic SPY 350 position. That's hardly putting your money where your mouth is.

There is no saving them now. You had all morning to get out.
It would be glorious to time a drop but can be just as good with correctly timed calls
Who is this tall bitch?
agshwjwjwkq you guys fucking amaze me sometimes with your logic

If you think the market is going to implode and do so within 2 months, and you have confidence in your own fucking DD, would YOUR play to buy $350 SPY calls?

If so you're either fucking retarded or don't fully believe your own DD. OP didn't say it was going to be small. He said it was going to crash and soon, so saying 'if it's a big or small drop' doesn't apply, because OP specifically stated 29 million times in that post that he expected a big drop.
i can't believe HD. they beat earnings, revenue

so what if they have a billion in employee costs. look at AMZN with around 5X the number of employees
Why SPY such a cuck
That's what I came to this thread to figure out lol
this gave me the confirmation bias i needed

More like he's being smart and not going all in on moves predicated on our market crashing, some people hedge and know they can't predict everything.
We haven't even gotten to DOMINION yet.  SPY gonna tank.  Rudy livestream now, THE KRACKEN IS RELEASED

It's just about if it can hold above 500. If so, then potential blastoff. If not, consolidate back to 400-440 range that it's been stuck in. If it ends in 440-500 range also bullish as it would be rejected by 500 but finishes above the previous consolidation block. 

I personally sold at 500 today, will be looking to re-enter once it consolidates again.

Yep.  The first recorded major manipulation of the options market was conducted by a Greek astronomer named Thales around 600 BC. 

He YOLO'd on Olive Press options and exercised his options when the demand went up, creating a monopoly on institutional olive presses and becoming filthy rich.

Basically his YOLO was so big he created a squeeze.

People are doing take out orders WAY more than they have previously done before the pandemic. These big chain restaurants have adjusted themselves to the pandemic and have brought forth online ordering taking themselves into "ghost kitchen" territory. Food ordering apps have facilitated this phenomenon and this will continue until things get "back to normal" and more people go out to eat at restaurants.

Because it's a win-win for everyone involved (except probably retail, given the comically strong moral hazard).

It's here to stay and I suspect it'll become the norm rather than the exception.  IPOs will feel quaint, like when grandma mails you a Christmas card with an ounce of pet rocks inside.

I have one counter to all of this:

**There is pent up money in the middle and upper class doing absolutely nothing.**

> 33% said they would mostly save, and 52% said they would pay down debt [[1](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/inequality/stimulus-checks-spend-save-liquidity/)]

A giant majority of people paid down their debt, or saved the stimulus. Not only are we on track to get another stim but lots of people have started working from home, making food themselves to avoid going out, and cut frivolous spending all together. Where do you think all that saved money is going?

>22% of Americans saved up cash during the pandemic. [[2](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/select/americans-saved-money-during-coronavirus-pandemic/)]

Consumer spending accounts for almost 70% of the US economy [[3](https://time.com/nextadvisor/banking/savings/us-saving-rate-soaring/)] and most Americans are ready to go back out to dinner, the mall, and movie theaters as soon as it’s safe. You’re going to see an EXPLOSION of spending in 6 months time - staggered as the vaccine is. Betting on a short term down market because of job loss is ignoring every other metric our there. Companies that survived the pandemic will be positioned stronger, more people will have bigger checking accounts do to working from home and the growth of the entertainment and vacation industry basically overnight will carry the rest. 

TL;DR - Bears are never right long term so bet long term, hold some cash to buy dips, and chill.
Have they even sold any cars this year!?

Assuming a non depreciating , non income generating with equalized appreciation property class. 

prime -.25  > prime +0.15. 

You’ll rarely find underwriters whole have that spread unless 
1) small / private lender v big bank
2) credit / income of the two borrowers deviate that much
3) the lender / bank hates money and either the prime-.25 is too low or the prime+.15 is too high.

Going into IPO's on the cusp of a potential market correction is a dumbass idea. Sure, you might get super lucky, but probably not.
Roll up and out.
throw some in my tuition?
Although they are...you figure it's offsetting fixed costs.   Some of the raw materials they buy may also be purchased for other things..... bigger orders...bulk discounts....  maybe some new equipment that will be used post covid vax thats getting some accelerated depreciation.....    all that good pr from saying non profit.   

I feel like even though they're zeroing their profits against vax sale....its of financial fuckery and is beneficial.  How significant.  Not sure.
Why tf would you buy that far OTM? It's never even hit $320 and that was before all of the Ant IPO shit.

Stop buying up SPY every time it drops you idiots. You will never financially recover from this
can you not post the ticker?
One more comment on this - it introduces problems if you are planning a long term hold on a stock. If the stock goes up substantially you either let your shares get called away or you buy back the options at a loss. Now if the stock faces a downturn you've lost money on the calls you sold plus the shares you're holding, it's a double whammy.

So you should really only do it if you're ok selling your shares off at a target price.

Hey, I actually did sell for a loss which I’m fine with - the relatively large buy order was a mistake in the first place. 

In total, it was a [$33K realized loss](https://i.imgur.com/oYjaezP.jpg) which I can use as tax loss harvesting to reduce capital gains taxes on other investments. 

It has also allowed me to diversify & keep much more in cash to DCA overtime. With the recent market rally, I’ve ‘made back’ almost $20K. 

I’m still long on TSLA, but have a much smaller position, about $50K worth. It’s great to know it’ll be added to the S&P. I don’t concern myself over the what-ifs, just glad to be making profit.
*We're looking forward*

Okay - let's do that. How long until banks reach their 52 week high when interest rates will be set at shit for the next 3 years and there's a risk of increased regulation from DC?

There will be another buying point. Historically it’s always bled for a 1-2 month period after reaching new highs. 

This post isn’t a recommendation to buy calls today and make a shit load of money. Definitely look at how the stock usually moves and find a good buying point.

Seems like they have some pricing in done for the earnings. Shares anyways so no IV crush and I’m not saying it won’t run off of that. But TSLA spent years not mooning off of earnings, idk hearing aids can be expensive as fuck, literally almost as much as a Tesla, definitely bullish

Lol what? You need to stop edging and bust that nut. It’s making you crazy
PLTR is just sitting at 18.5 soaking up every single sell order. This honestly feels really bullish. Its fueling for the next leg up.

18p and 20p for either a month or two out. I plan on closing them if they hit 30-50% of value and then rinse repeat.

so close. was almost up 420.69 on one of my accounts
Depends on the stock

Take TSLA for example. A few weeks ago, selling 420-450 covered calls was easy money

Now take the current rally. Sure, you would have made a few grand on your covered call + whatever appreciation you had from holding the stock.

But let's say you sold the 420 call. You make a few grand, the shares get pulled away from you when TSLA rallies to 500. You missed out on 80$ per share, so $8000 gain.
I was hoping for a return to the top by Feb. but if it clears 300 by end of year I’ll close out and capture all that premium

I'd be green if I didn't paper fingers baba 260s
Baba is a stonk and therefore goes up
Sure, just depends on how bullish you are. The contracts are 20p dated a month out, and 18p 3 months out. I can also close the contracts anytime once I'm up, which they are already up today. 

I am probably more intimately familiar with government work and the military than most. Hence why I am so bullish. 

It's a gamble I'm willing to take with contracts already being executed and awarded.

What’s the next target price
Guess lots of retards in here sold their BABA calls that’s why it’s going up now
Do you really believe tesla deserves 1000x P/E in our current economy
Like everything on WSB, just think of it as another location on the spectrum. From least leverage to the most leverage:

**Selling puts -> Covered calls -> shares -> bull credit spread -> bull debit spread -> calls**
All AMD needs to do is supply more cards than Nvidia.  Consumers are buying every bit of next gen hardware they can get and both companies are supply constrained.

Panasonic is expanding like a wild fire in California. Tesla is their biggest client, but now they are looking to provide their batteries to everyone making EVs, which is everyone. They expanding into Europe.
This thread, lmao. This is exactly what people were whining isn't posted on WSB anymore due to the ocean of low-effort NIO memes and $500 gain porn, and here we have a sea of retards who get their investment knowledge from TikTok trying to shout down a CFI giving legit DD with data and sources

Nobody posts real shit anymore? Mystery solved.
Any thoughts on what could push it back towards 600?
Idk honestly, just seems to be the time momentum either dies or increases.
VIX so low lately is definitely lulling everyone into a false sense of security. I'm scared shitless 💩

if you double down on the position, you can break even, just saying

the fed buying cooperate bonds is actually straight up illegal and against the federal reserve act. The fed can only buy etf's, and they skirted this rule by making their own "etfs" with the bonds they wanted to buy which essentially is like seeing a do not enter sign, stepping two meters to the right and walking through. 

  
Fucking bullshit that none of this will ever get enforced because politicians love the FED for doing it, but it also means that the FED will most likely end up buying straight equities during the next crash. In for a penny, in for a pound right?
Lmao im watching it right now
Downside risk of underlying going down bigly for a net loss.

Basically caps your delta gain depend on sold delta but protects your downside risk as well. I sell em on big green days, a few % OTM

just saw that gay bear post lol, gonna go all in on vix puts
Does it not go to the teddies supply?
Sorry to get all investing on you guys, but does anyone sell covered calls? I'm not seeing what the downside risk is. Missing out on potential gains when your shares are called away? But then you have cash and can just do it again... What am I missing?
AMD please
how we feeling about metals fam
Get in some cock push-ups.

What if Jack Ma lied about his sexuality this whole time? Would that be a potential catalyst for BABA?
Probably won’t break out until early next year. I think it’s consolidating right now.
School being closed means now kids will have more time to trade meme stocks on RH. Trade accordingly

You know what that means right? Time to quit your job.
I agree with you there. I was in cruise but dumped after the vaccine news at a gain. I think they will go up once the vaccine is out but not to 2019 levels.
🌽🌽🌽
no:(
Triple top?
Honestly it looks like it's gonna explode upwards IMO. I've been watching it all day too.
Selling, or holding?

You misunderstand. I thought the inference was we let EV companies get away with stuff with things others wouldn't. He clarified afterwards
Lol the thing is it’s a great time to buy pltr. People are just panicking because of 11/20 calls
Update us you autist
Hahah!!!!!! You moron
I’d like to exit my puts. Can we fuggin dump one more time

China with 1.4 B population alone. Where they dont need lifted trucks and cars that go 140MPH. The solo cars make sense for their country. I hold no positions in it though.
the Fed does not buy bonds using "cash" because it cannot print cash. It buys them using bank reserves, which cannot be used for anything else other than collateral.
That’s the problem.. but this is fake

Yupp. 10% drop incoming. This coming from someone who rode it up from $14. Ride up ride down.
I agree tesla long term has amazing long term potential. 

Although you're ignoring what's happening today, and the temperature of the market for the next two months. Biden's tax plan coming, people locking in earnings. S&P Index fund won't be buying shares until Dec 21st, and if the price stays high, Telsa will issue more shares diluting the value. Model 3 was just discontinued for production profit loss.
The market inversed me today
u/shittytranslatorbot
Next to nothing. Lots of talk, very little action. The truth is, every so many months, someone claiming not to be a bear comes on WSB looking for validation of their theories.

Yes, the market is propped up. The economy and stock market havent been this far divorced since I've been alive. That said, this has been true for YEARS. Trying to time the market is fucking stupid and one of the most guaranteed ways to hand your money over to the pros. 

Unless you're retiring in the next few years, which I'm guessing it's a nearly zero percent of this sub, who the fuck cares. Invest yesterday and keep investing.
Sounds like a time paradox to me.

I'm *that guy* now. No idea what to trade. Not gonna FOMO into PLTR and TSLA. Doesn't look like the indices are going anywhere but theta. I guess I'll sell some puts.

Idk. Those granola bars are lit.

I left pltr and snap for all in on gme. Missing out on huge gains. Hope this fills in the missing.
I agree and am also long in recovery stocks. I disagree with cruise stocks reaching 2019 levels though. They dumped too much stock to reach those levels again without serious demand or buybacks. Idk but I doubt they will be doing buybacks anytime soon with the massive debt they have taken out. Some recovery, but not back 100%.
100%
UK public sector revenues looking rosy too; big defense budget injection and NHS likely to extend contract.

why, bc the tsla dip?
why tho
It has its days. I'm getting better. Went from -98% ytd to -48% ytd just this month. Ive figured some things out, education isnt free. First year trading options, started buying calls in febuary, should've bought puts instead, I'd be rich. Then I tried to catch the falling knife in early March. Then bought shares and sat on the sidelines all summer. Now I'm just following the money, trading mostly leap debit spreads, occasional fd scratch offs, leaving 50% cash value as much as possible, it's working out well so far which means this probably the top lol. Now a days if I'm making money on something and then I start to see it all over wsb everyday that's my que to exit.

Of the people that have been around for more than a couple months it’s way higher than that.  Most of theta gang is probably at that point or higher.  My house and 401k puts me over that threshold alone.

Now if you are talking about folks that are making degenerate plays with 100k that is a different story.

Damn Tesla what a ride today. Wonder if it’ll hold
Instead of money being pulled out this time it's just going to be moved to tech so SPX and NDX are going to be fine or go up while the Dow plummets. The market has nothing to do with the economy so acting like the economy being in shambles matters is dumb. Enjoy losing your money.

Show me your puts. You don’t have the balls to actually take a position.
i like pton the most because of the quality and the build. i am just noting that competition is catching up to pton in terms of the subscription based model and the design of the product, simple, less buttons, huge screen, etc.

pton has 2.5 million monthly subs and it is for that reason the king. Their workout trainers are literally celebs at this point. i'm just saying, that competition is paying attention and mimicking their business model. thats all. i actually tried their cheap 2021 Tread at the store. we're all for pton as our bike/treadmill.

It always comes back to Mr. Wonderful, but I have to agree with my dildo partner.

Watching BABA lift off is like watching a god damned turkey try to fly.
The catalyst is every analyst scouring the markets for undervalued EV plays right now.  If the reverse merger happens next month as planned this one will moon, if not sooner on the rumor.  Canoo vehicles are cool as shit I’ve already seen them in LA and their disruptive first-of-it’s-kind subscription business model could make them extremely valuable.

Welcome my brother. Tsla bang gang jumping into pltr
100% of my portfolio is in Chinese stocks.... is that unamerican?
As in up?
So you're saying if he 'changes his mind' again and holds or buys up more, then it IS manipulation?

I look at what makes sense in terms of financial motives, and the only one that makes sense to me is to keep the price down while he buys more.

This wasn't some offhand remark, it was a deliberately issued announcement, so WTF would he do that knowing that it would have a negative impact on the price of a stock in which he holds a very large position. Just out of spite?

I mean, he still has an obligation to the investors in his fund to maximize their returns.

Just doesn't make any sense.
Shiny and chrome!
For real. As soon as I break even I'm fucking out
Just bought feb CRSR 50c's cuz why not
Can we not post about it so it doesn’t get ruined
I think SPY is rigged

I’m holding 5 11/27 $17p on CCL and going to pick up 11/20 $26p on NKLA but just waiting for retards to stop buying

Imagine thinking your shit don't stink for buying PTON at $99 - slow down on those gains cuz
Works until you have to buy the shares for a 30% premium when it crashes
but why 1-2 est?
I believe many big traders are buying calls/shares now because they anticipate the same thing we do. The volume since the announcement has been insane and can't just be retail traders.

Yeah I’ve read these posts for years now.

The end of the day there’s still a rabid market of buyers that’s growing from lower costs to buy in and cash is basically worthless, interest rates are trash. 

If it crashes to March levels I will just buy up like crazy

If you want a call though. CRSR 15 JAN 21 45C about 380 a contract.
give up tesla bears, you're wrong about this company. How much of elon's cock do you have to take to admit this?
Honestly you’d be surprised how financially dumb some people with high incomes are. 

Fact is people incredibly skilled and specialized in one field just has a short understanding in many others. It’s normal since it’s tough to be jack of all trades or immerse yourself with multiple facets of knowledge when you’ve spent 12-16h a day for 8years buried in anatomy and physiology books. 

I’m a real estate investor and had to explain to several physicians why it was important to get maximum leverage in real estate when the value is heavily weighted on appreciation. 

And also why sub prime interest for 25 years is a fucking fantastic deal with respect to long term growth. 

But nope. Cash buy plz no debt🤪
If stripe merged with psth, would we see levels close to SQ?
Yeah I have. Made a 5 bagger overnight on TSLA calls. But expecting to run up more without any pullback is pushing ur luck.

B) The new CEO comes in on Feb 1, which unfortunately is after my call expires, but hopefully it will provide a bump after the new year.
Lol, he bought shares, "the top is in" on a stock that's existed for 6 weeks?  Please.

Yeah, you're right. I didn't do enough research.

If Jerome Powell (retard) says the market is going to do well, it will do well. If we all value the market, the value will remain high. This isn't rocket science.

We're all too poor to own actual Teslas because we lose all our money on Tesla YOLOs one way or the other.

BABA YES
Selling OTM SPY covered calls and buying back at ~80% profit. What do returns on this look like?
Sir this is WSB. Nothing here is obvious
the only way im making my money back is if SPY hits 5, thats right $5 per share
even if we push to 500, these 11/20 wont be worth shit

You bought shares... Unless you need that money to pay rent hold on, no way it's not higher eventually.
Apple needs to go up to $121, so I can get rid of that pile of crap
Thats PLTR's model too
On premise 3:

It's technically correct that money from the fed printer does not go directly into the market (yet). But think clearly for a second.

 If you're a bank administrator in a market crash and the fed gives you a bunch of free money to sell as loans, what are you going to do with the extra room in your budget? 

The QE reserves give banks breathing room to use their other capital to play in the market.
Solid.  I'm just scared of the next big pump if the FDA rushes the EA on the vaccines and it comes in next couple weeks

Hey man,

This is just how we talk. It's our culture. I appreciate your post. It was excellent and well-thought out. But all we do here is call each other names. Honestly I wouldn't be saying your post is excellent and well thought out but you seem genuinely offended. I'd just be calling you a lame-ass otherwise.
TSLA bulls, definitely don’t sell. Hold on because that’s the smart thing to do. You will not regret it and that’s a WSB guarantee
I threw 10% of my portfolio into BABA calls this past week
It’s very undervalued and one of the hottest stocks in the past month, with lots of positive catalysts coming up. But ok
Is TSM worth buying today?????
I don’t know shit but when I see breakout to ath on every company across the board including those that have negative growth and is losing money hand over fist. I get the fuck out and look for shorting opportunity.

By the way, CRSR 40/45c 12/18 spreads are the way to go. They're a 4x gain if it ends above 45 by expiry.
Enjoy the daily bumps....and the daily price increases too
What news
TSLA calls 

***Tesla (TSLA) Model S is no longer recommended by consumer reports given reliability concerns, CNBC***

Then feels I have 19.5c 11/20 as well so even worse :)
Jesus that chart
I’ve been buying and selling SPY all morning.  Probably up about $1k. 🤷🏻‍♂️
How do you become a CEO of Rim Jobs?
They are lulling call holders to sleep.  You can see the sell order pop down.  Smaller blocks/ not too big, just enough to fill down to the last low before they let retail buy back in and rinse and repeat.
you tell me lol
GME next leg up starting in 3....2....1....
Move along guys, nothing to see here.
Just another bubble boy.
Pltr calls close to the money a month or more out
K, obviously...?
>t keep in mind he is the CEO of SpaceX as well - from what I recall, there are some big institutions invested in it. And plus he's likely planning on taking Starlink public at some point, so it's in his interest to make sure WallSt isn't getting fucked due to TSLA getting included in the S&P.

I mean I don't think he gives a fuck. They shit on him and tesla for 10+ years why would he look to do them a favor now? He even was taking cheep shots at them and the SEC awhile back.
FOMO FYL
I’m pretty sure my meth crystal also knows that so I don’t think there’s much of a competitive advantage there.
On the weekends I go downtown and beat up the homeless for the money they made pan handling. If you need some more money to invest thats something you could do. Beats sucking dick behind the Wendy's.

Just get some really long dated options. You don’t have to get just the weeklies. Maybe monthlies out to do it? 


In all seriousness you should throw some Tesla and pltr in there. Rn they are overpriced but they have the highest amount of growth in them. AAPL and amazon are running out of ways to expand their customer base is more or less everyone at this point.

You're not getting the point. 

OP LITERALLY contradicts himself. "2 months tops" is an exact quote by him, so if you're confident enough to say that, there's 0 reason for him not to buy puts 3 months out. 

His positions don't indicate his sentiment, not even close. If you can't see that, then go ahead and follow suit with him and buy your pussy ass SPY puts and volatility calls with him and wait for a dip. 

OP is using rationality in an irrational market, and even then he's not even following his own teachings verbatim.

I don't know the term AM, what do you mean, I'm curious and can't think of something that fits
Tesla DOES have massive growth potential, but at its current price, all growth for the next 3 years is absolutely priced in, 5 years probably, 10 years still probably priced in, hell it's probably just way overpriced in general...

Book value per share is something like $20 ? Share price is almost $500.

And... TSLA is only 40% institutional holders. Most are retail investors who don't even know what DD stands for.   


The current TSLA price doesn't make sense, but you can't predict if or when it will drop, so... I wouldn't buy puts on it. I'd just stay away.

TLSA 500 marks the end of the EV bubble. There will be some residual buying into year end (especially next week, and the week post thanksgiving) but it's over. Time to consolidate.  


Also, TSLA $500 probably won't mark the top for TSLA. TSLA $500,000,000,000 market capitalization will.
Fyi, stonks only go up.

SBE, buy now before this shit rockets

This
PLTR I actually did DD, I'm genuinely long on them but I sold for my investment back and am letting 1/2022's ride for a few months. 

AMD seemed under-valued compared to it's Sept high and the general hype around it's products. Did some minor-DD and see their chips and chip-manufacturer are doing great. 

SPY lucky as fuck, threw a lotto out and got lucky on gut feelings. 

CHWY no DD, but it's my Covid play and I feel like they're just going to continue to expand anyway. They have shittons of warehouses, pay $15/hour already, and everyone has already discovered them during Covid. $80 by Jan easy.
Can y’all go into mara and riot so I can make $$. Ty in advance
Dude's 90 years old, PLTR might be his last big play. And isn't it stock manipulation eother way? I mean, he's under no legal obligation to follow through with his claim, and I see absolutely no reason to disclose that you're going to sell off while you're still holding.

When was the last time you heard a large scale investor outright tell the world when they were going to buy into or sell out of a large position?

Never, that's when.
I mean better save than sorry
This doesn’t look sideways to me 😏
TLDR SPY $380 by 12.31.20
Why would it pull back? Its going up because MM’s are loading up for long term
Sell everything but a small part of your position and take a nice walk winner.
My fucking ATH keeps fading away. Wake me up when it's September again.
The irony is that OP is almost certainly not the Steven Van Metre you looked up!   


There is a hint in the post above - actually several. And more in history as OP only joined Reddit in Sept 2020.   


OP is probably separation variation reincarnated. SV

Is there going to be a pot of gold at the end of it?
>500 will easily print
I mean yeah, its pretty smart to slowly get into bearish options as it goes on.  No reason to go full in if you're smart, even if you think a crash will happen doesn't mean you have to go full retard (like you) and buy expensive puts that may get fucked.

Only true retards actually think they know exactly what will happen (like you think everyone should act).  OP is being smart and accepting that he can be wrong, this way he won't lose much or at all hopefully.
I like your info, your logical reaoning, and understanding.

Market have never crashed with interest rates soo low.
Another stimulus package or two will greatly help the markets in short run, but not necessarily the rest of the economy.
How much of a pull back are we talking here? 10-20%?
And
A pullback would encourage another immediate and big stimulus.
There goes ZM straight back to $500 you go

Honestly not too sure. I bought in first thing this morning as I was excited about their new cards and got some options. made $200 profit so far.
I have a feeling NVDA is about to go on a faceripper to like 620 over the next couple weeks. After earnings market seems like MMs trying to cuck retail out of a dip buying opportunity

Tesla will be closer to 600 than 400 eom that’s for sure lol
Bought on the low of the day it was announced Tesla would be added to the s&p, so around 440 - 450. Tesla swings so fast lol
TSLA open 530
That will largely have the same effect, since MMs or whomever wrote the contracts will need to produce and sell shares when the funds exercise. This means that they will be the ones forced to perform the buying, but the buying will still take place. Softbank just did this on a massive scale speculatively with many tech stocks.

I agree with his due diligence but it has been obvious since Sept that recovery stocks not tech are now the play. Tech valuations hit their real peak around labor day. I exited all my tech stocks and moved them into recovery then. I am long these recovery stocks so worse case is I wait longer, I don't think any are in danger of BK. If you look at airlines, hotels, cruise lines (most risky) etc they all have room to run back to 2019 levels.
Could be the lack of stimulus money
Hope you're right. I grabbed some 550$ 11/27 calls that were not cheap!

A price that balances the premium you’d like to make on the put at a strike that you feel comfortable buying shares at. I would go slight OTM (18 or 17.5). Chances are high that they would be exercised at the next dip down. The goal is to get paid to buy the shares by the premium (rather than just buying straight out). Once the put is exercised and you have the shares, you sell your covered call.

I ran my optimizer for the case that TTCF is around $17.50 on 4/16/21, here's what it's telling me:

* Buy $2.5 calls for $1390 max.
* Sell $17.5 calls for $310 min.
* Sell $17.5 puts for $490 min.

Overall, you'll have to spend $590 to enter this play and will make a nice profit of $866 if TTCF ends up around $17.50, but anything above $13 is profitable for you. On the other hand, the downside risk up to $2340 is TTCF reaches rock bottom. If you're now willing to take this risk or have a different idea on where TTCF is going, check out my optimizer at [https://velistos.com](https://velistos.com) to calculate the most profitable option strategies.

So why didnt S&P announce Tesla's inclusion after they already bought the stock? Instead of announcing a future inclusion, causing a pump and them having to pay more. Would that be an SEC violation or something?

citron got fucked again too, they probably short that shit when they publish it
Depends on how momentum is between 1-2 est. if it’s still going, we could see a 10 to 15% up day. If it dies down, we will drop. Regardless I would expect it to be below 250 tomorrow. The profit taking from the massive 250 call volume almost guarantees that. Would not be surprised to see below 240 tomorrow either. Around 3-4 est tomorrow is when you wanna get into calls for 11/27. 

My personal feeling is that it’s making a move to over 300 as the guys on CNBC said. It’s valuation has traded in lockstep with Pinterest over the last 7 months. Similar revenue, similar kind of investor that buys the stock. Which implies at least 30% upside from current levels.  Roku has a higher revenue growth rate though, and is now actually profitable. On a GAAP basis, not that non GAAP bullshit. So I think it should have a higher valuation than Pinterest. Then again, PINS is certainly overvalued. But how much do you pay for platforms with 50 million users in the case of Roku and >300 million in the case of pins. Monetization means potential exponential revenue growth, therefore profit. Same story as FB, GOOGl. Twtr failed, snap has maybe failed at doing this sort of thing. Time will tell how Roku and pins fair. 

Regardless, when Roku breaks out it usually goes higher than just 10%. So 300 in the very near term is going to happen, imo. Unless market tanks. Look for down day tomorrow, and then big day on Monday. Might be able to get in at open on Monday, but then again move may already be pretty big.
It happened yesterday as well before the sell off started the last 2-3 hours

Some DD for you autists because it is only just over a month to Christmas after all.

The head of the Oxford Vaccine Group said today that efficacy data on the AZN/Oxford vaccine will “definitely” be released “before Christmas.”

When determining what is meant by “before Christmas” you should bear in mind that the the last day of term at Oxford University before Christmas is 4 December. Therefore I would expect the timeline he had in mind was not any time before 25 December. It is probably earlier than that. 

The Oxford/AZN vaccine is 3-4 USD according to the sources I have seen. The PFE and MRNA vaccines are much more expensive (I have seen estimates they are ten times the cost of the AZN vaccine). The AZN vaccine requires no special cold chain to transport or store it. Due to those cost and temperature factors it will almost certainly be the vaccine of choice in India and across most of Asia and therefore for most of the world’s population. 

Make of those pieces of information what you will. I’m in on AZN calls.

I mean... everything he said is objectively true. The problem is that the market doesn’t give a shit about what is happening right now because we all know the pandemic will be over this time next year and the fed will be pumping liquidity into the market from now until then. My guess is that the indexes won’t move much at all because the overvalued ‘stay at home’ stocks will drop while the undervalued epicenter stocks will rise and basically cancel each other out.
No way ...tho I am  short

Tesla's Valuation Is Greater Than Nearly the Entire Auto Industry ..

TESLA : 480 Billion Dollars

REST OF THE INDUSTRY : 422 Billion Dollars
This is high quality content. I read through the entire post. DD is top notch and would agree that the markets are highly overvalued. 

I’ll keep holding on to my investments regardless of what occurs. Im just bit buying for now.

I may do some put options for the first time since March in a month or so.

i rode the meme wave and took 1/21/23 20c a couple of weeks ago
Your last paragraph makes no sense. Your DD is based off of long-term fundamentals, with some charts stretching years. But you’re also telling me you’re going to exit your bearish positions when things “stabilize”, ie over a short time frame like 1 month. Fun fact, stocks go up before they go down. So unless you have a clear definition of what stabilization means, this isn’t a strategy. You just have Google.

Wow, I'm so sorry I thought he'd have more confidence in his own DD than $350 SPY puts and volatility index calls. 

You're right bro, dude is just balls deep in thinking the market is going to explode. 5 whole ass dollar SPY calls. What would we ever do if SPY dipped that much.
P/E ratio is great and all but analysts need to invent a metric that measures FOMO

None of this fundamental crap matter anymore.  In your 20 years of experience did you ever think “man, this company is executing so well, they’ll be a trillion market cap in less that a year, then double. Actually several companies will hit a $trillion mc and then some in a colossal of a fucking pandemic” ?

So if they get in and gets pumped up, can it get dumped out?
1% everyday for a week takes us above $270!
YES TSLA! I wanna be a SLUT FIR YOUR BIG GREEN COCK 🌲
So more detail. First is with schwab that I just got two months ago after a layoff with Vanguard. Job feels like a bit of a bait and switch (way more operational than advertised) also I can kind of see my own glass ceiling because it is a niche department in stock plan admin. But it does pay well, and I will feel like a piece of shit for quitting on them after I pretty much just got up to speed. At the same time  the management style is a lot tougher than what I'm used too. The people otherwise are great to work with.

2nd job, again is really just a guys own firm. Already has 80+ clients average over 1mil under management and wants to double that in the next 5-7 years. I would be primarily in charge of investment analysis but will "wear many hats" from admin like opening accounts to marketing which we will partner doing. The guy is also pretty genuine from our meetings. Also seems like if those longer term goals are hit I would become a partner with equity in the firm. I also think I would like this more than my button pushing, high volume, stress/responsibility operations job.

Tough decision. Tbh

You might want to cover your IB username so your employer doesn't fire you.
I don’t know. No argument, this company is dog shit. However, if I was Trevor Milton, I wouldn’t sell when the lock up expires. Everyone is expecting him and others to dump shares when the lock up period ends....but why? EV is rocking lately running in to an EV friendly president. Gm deal I believe is still on the table. If I’m Trevor Milton, I’m not dumping everything. I’m selling a few to be comfortable and then letting it ride. I might be wrong. Everyone is convinced this is going to fall off a cliff. As it should. I don’t know if that will actually be the case though. We will see.

It's definitely a long position because like how India has been booming on social media apps because of their rising internet user base I definitely see the youth and the continent as a whole embracing technology.

You ever tried to cut a tiny sausage with one hand?
Quicker and less regulatory hoops to jump though. So many Tech companies can take advantage of all this craziness in the market and get rid of their equity before the inevitable drop occurs.
Every time you read something here pumping it up or trashing it, do your due diligence (dd).

If you want to actually make money, you have to think of this as like you're an investigator. You need to understand all angles and gather all the info to make educated assessments and informed decisions. Even then you'll still get some wrong.

If you still have accounts with them, I’d specially call the active trader number and request to initiate a trade dispute based on that specific trade. Have all the details ready like trade date, time, and if you can what the fill should’ve been. They take their service and their trade disputes super seriously. Tell them that you called about this before and tell them you feel it didn’t get handled properly.

I’m going to go ahead and say this post is mostly true just because 98% of WSB is calling it retarded. When a gay bear post is agreed upon by WSB, you know the market is gonna sky rocket. When a bear post is met with pure bullish sentiment, it’s Pokimane calling the top again. I haven’t been selling all my positions but my bill positions have been smaller and smaller with a bit more cash holding going on.
Good to show the day's support levels. Also I mostly watch the 1 minutes on the daily
Nobody meming PLTR anymore?
And let's be clear here. I'm not talking about practical numbers or facts, I'm talking about the same hype that drove the stock to 90 in the first place. That made no fucking sense either.

But if you're worried about a 3000 refresh suddenly smashing AMD off the board and killing that hype, don't be. Look at how the repsective cards are clocking. The 3000 series is pretty much tapped out out of the box, not a lot of overhead for overclockers to reach for and the silicon is already clean, so there won't be significant improvements in die quality or yield.

AMD is the exact opposite. Golden cards are popping up everywhere and OC'ers are taking their little red rockets to the moon. The die quality and yield will improve significantly over time, costs will come down and AMD will remain competitive on all levels. That kind of hype takes market share from the competitor.

Ask me how many times I've watched this happen, for both sides.
Fuck off
Anyone have a link to this mango conference?
ya i hope youre right
Me too. I mean I’ll take it but wonder what happened.
I bought yesterday and today it has been moving sideways. Sure it went up and down a few 10 cents but it never reached 20. I guess it must be because the rocket ship is still being fueled.

Tesla hits bottom in Consumer Reports survey
Tesla Inc. fell by two spots in Consumer Reports Magazine’s annual reliability study after its Model Y crossover was reported to have body-hardware and paint issues.

Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports stated these are not typical problems for new models and added it is "really disappointing when you spend this much money for a car and hopefully they’ll be able to rectify a lot of these as time goes by."

Tesla is now at the 25th spot out of 26 brands rated in the US market. The last one is Ford Motor Co’s Lincoln luxury brand.

Bet safely on Tesla!

You see that little crash on COTY 15 minutes ago?  I caused that when I dumped my $6c lol first time manipulating a stock
Up 215%
Can someone pleeeease explain whats going on with BLNK? I mean I’m not complaining, I’m just confused lmao
I agree with you, but I also agree with OP. However, "time in the market > timing the market".
No
I thnk the move here is actually 01/15/2021 Nio calls, which I will hammer next time it drops. The reason is Nio day is 01/09/2021 and they usually unveil another car and have huge turn out, this is the move.
He has a mil at his disposal, you think he gives a fuck about making 12K?
Which piece of shit
Is mentioning $RKT just an unsubtle attempt at trolling now. We haven't seen price action in days its just trading sideways.

How fast do you want a return or loss? If you

Buy NIO stock and wait a couple years, shorter buy calls for January, can fuck with apple calls, Boeing $250 calls are prob a good bet, find a company that tickles your balls and see what people are saying about it here. Usually the general consensus is on point, unless you’re a gay bear then die

this comment right here will help you avoid losing money. Also do your research, a 5 minute google search into the company will give you a better indicator if they’re a good investment.
Cause I’m retarded duh do you forget where you are
Used his TSLA tendies to make sure the price stays up
Is pltr ever gonna hit 19?
I bought it, actually did some research, then immediately sold because it's just a pump and dump. Managed to gtfo near the top of the pump though so no complaints.

dude, you're embarrassing yourself.

FED has been promising inflation due to their QE policies since 2012.Never happened.  Come on.

CIIC dumping
Doesn't there need to be a catalyst for a crash anyways? What, if anything, could that catalyst be? A lockdown won't happen and if it did, Joey B would fund everything.

amd finally starting to adjust its price to match recent news. 100 by january
today is the MM giving a win to some WSB favorites, AMD, NIO, BABA, TSLA all having nice days
Why is PSTH drilling?
Its survivorship bias which is why it is always good that people post losses on here as well. But you see the one guy who took 10K to 100K on a YOLO and you think "oh I can do that" and poof you have $100 left. I wish I could find this post where this guy took sub 100K to 1MM but he talked about how weeklies and SPY yolos really were just throwing money away.
> If you develop an instinct for these things, you can almost feel it in your gut. 
  
I think youre confusing your dads shlong with useful fundamental indicators
If a little intra-day drop in TSLA worries you, play some other ticker.
CIIC dip buying opportunity?
Y'all better buy this AMD dip, boutta skyrocket.
The OI is dropping by 30% each day.  Calls are being dumped.

PLTR with the loch ness shaped recovery
Imagine not buying that tsla dip
Well, that’s enough DD for me. Sign me the fuck up.
I can explain

First, it dipped to give my puts hope

Then when they reached breakeven, I didn't set a stop loss even though I knew spy would pump.

It did.

Then I diamond handed until they broke even again on the second dip. I didn't sell even though I swore to the bear God that I would.

SPY pumps again

Next, I bought oneore put at the third peak, and then when it dipped back down to almost breakeven, I bought a call as a hedge for the next inevitable pump.

Now SPY will be eternally stuck at 355.60
I’m a woman :)
Spy keeps making lower highs
Bruh I sold plug at $4. 300 shares
Thank you for buying the Tesla dip, come again
Oh lol, thought you had shares
Hahahahhahahahahhaha this is probably the funniest shit I’ve read in all of 2020 on here. I wish I wasn’t poor I’d give you a real 🥇
Happy international men’s day folks

Yes if you want to learn about options the guy to talk to there is VisceralAce.  There's a free social room you can tag him in, cant say he will answer if not on trial or membership though.  I just stick with day and swinging shares but he has like a 90% win rate on options so.  There's also a lot of documentation on it in the university section about day trading them.

Yo wtf BABA is green.
If you haven't had a death pool at your office, you need to find another job
My guess would be 248 if it was just a pump. 255 if it keeps up. I’m betting it’s going to end at 253.5
Whatever you do, POSITIONS OR BAN, thank you
Imagine not buying that Tesla dip
Gave me a sec to buy back into tesla with that dip after selling this morning at 505.
Agreed
Not even close

Still feels oversold. Every bit of vaccine news on the horizon will boost it because it means we're closer to the getting the foot traffic (still a ways off from gen pop of course), but the pattern seems to be rotation out of growth to value which seems to be CVS realm.

I also think investors will remember that CVS crushed earnings and  have a very well integrated company in healthcare. Amazon Pharmacy is a pretty big disruption but I don't see why CVS can't find a new home north of 70 or beyond.

PSTH diving after PSCM call. LOL I guess people were expecting the target announcement today?

While you are correct that drive through restaurants benefit, the ones i mentioned are not drive throughs. EAT is the parent company of Chilli's, they are not a fastfood restaurant.  Shake shak, does not operate drive thru', [and the rough time they experienced this spring is forcing them to study adopting them.](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/shake-shack-first-drive-thru) Both plummeted in March and April to a mere fraction of what they are now.
Buy back today when every other post is bout how the tsla dip blew up their account and sell at open tmr
chances PLTR rebounds to 19 eow?
My order on fidelity just got executed. In the game now.

Yea its pretty thin. But investors are fickle and will be leaning on that meeting for news. Just may be the catalyst that dumps it. I am willing to try it.
I remember back on February 13th they did, and it went up for the next week. I sold some on that and shouldn't have.
Tesla FD calls obviously
Just sell puts on it.

If your positions ends OTM, then walk away with the premium and have the most delicious Wendy's meal you've ever had.

If your positions ends ITM, then congratulations you may have just gotten some shares with reduced cost basis.

Shit's been fucked since before the pandemic, and throughout the pandemic. Market still up.   


Show me where else money can go, and I'll be bearish. Right now, there is no other option, so markets will stay where they are.  Fucking quote me on that.
Were you a bear? I stopped losing money when I stopped being a bear.
Fuel cell just went red lol
Holy shit wtffff
after it splits again
TSLA is free money rn
A bull case for chain restaurants is that the pandemic and shutdowns have hurt them but have hurt small or independent restaurants even more. I am super long $MCD because their franchisees are well capitalized and can better survive right now due to drive thru, delivery, and access to capital compared to mom and pop shops. When things get more normal, lots of restaurants would have died but the chains will likely still be open and take all those additional sales.

The business atmosphere in the Northeast is simply why I would stay. Tremendous income growth ? Also why I would stay.  But I think it’s most important to enjoy what you do, if you enjoy what you do you’re gonna put a lot more effort into it and over the years that has tremendous income growth in just about any market.

Why get out
[removed]
About to short amd there has to be a sell off
Time to wait and see what tesla decides to do. Looks like its about ready to be bought and launch to 510.
That AMD dildo was nothing short of heroic
Did you not read OP? So I argue his case on the side of buying TLT (a 30 yr bond ETF), and I think it's important to know that the market is not a reflection of the economy. He makes a much better case for it than I can, but: QE turns liquid assets into illiquid assets "owned" by the banks. This is, by nature, deflationary. 

From the side of SPY: QE artificially raises stock prices. The ECONOMY is in the tank right now, but the MARKET is sky-high. Basically, Steven is arguing (from what I understand) that the bubble is going to pop and we will see a major market correction because of this. 

Again, he may be wrong. Many people disagree with him, but I'm yoloing on the guy with ausbergers who isn't as blinded by perma-bulls as other stock advisors. iirc, the first guy to foresee the '08 crash was also on the spectrum, no?
Surprised you never mentioned Covid. Europe has shut down and crashed some of their markets (see Germany). NYC schools just don't their kids home...only a matter of time before city & state shut downs start here.
That’s true for any investing at anytime. You have a 75% of it going up if you give yourself about 13 months
Consolidation on SPY. This shit is about to dump.

I'm not sure it has to do with luck as much as it does with buying calls on something that's run up 25% in 3 days.
YO WHAT AMD NEWS DROPPED??? I have one shitty call and it is looking nice
Bought a call right when it was $507...
these dusty calls i bought awhile back may not be so dead after all :,)
[removed]
Is nio dead
Feel like ackman is the type of guy that wants you to doubt him and then WHAM come out with some groundbreaking news to give a fat W to the ones that never doubted him... One can hope anyways lol
I ran my optimizer for the case that Tesla is around $600 by Christmas, here's what it's telling me:

* Buy $20 calls for $48810 max.
* Sell $600 calls for $2175 min.
* Sell $600 puts for $11495 min.

Overall, it costs you $35140 to enter this play, which make you a solid $22860 if Tesla reached 600 dollars. Plus you'll be able to post some nice gain porn as lang as Telsa is above $486. However, should Tesla do the old HRTZ move for whatever reason, you'd be producing some hard 91k loss porn.

So this play obviously isn't for everybody since the buy-in price is so high and the balls required to pull it off must be quite big. If you want to know a most profitable strategy with a limited max loss or if you aren't as bullish on Papa Elon's money printer as u/ThatKarmaWhore , check out my option strategy optimizer over at [https://velistos.com](https://velistos.com)
ZM seems to have resistance at 425, should have a nice run if it breaks through
At 500 it is.. but sp500 has to buy in so... That's a lot of buying
In it already
My pf down 80% time to bag hold😳😬
giant green dildos just blew through my AMD 85 sell wall

DO I HOLD AMD UNTIL EXP OR SEL 12/4
Everything is life on the prairie right now
AMD you beautiful fuck.
I can attest to this
I doubt TSLA will be a 700b car company, but I am willing to be wrong.
He said they were still on target for Q1 target no?
Making me dump my shares so you can get them cheap no way!

I really wanted to believe your dd but nowhere you speak about fed 2% inflation goals for the next few years.
Wtf happened it's rocketing
Calls
I'll do it for 7 %. Will either go up 70% or down 100% no in-between. We don't take bitches at ticker SLUT
TSLA on sale
stock? or calls, cuz i got fucked one two of my shop calls lol, never went back
I held VXX calls from July until the end of October and it pissed me off beyond belief. Since VXX tracks Vix futures contracts (average 1 month maturity) and not the actual Vix it can either work or completely diverge from the actual Vix. I don't like the daily exposure reset either. I was able to make back some of my loss on September 2-3 on the correction but other than that it didn't go up for shit, even when the Vix was spiking pre-election. I'm shorting using calls on the -3x leveraged ProShares funds so I can actually win when my predictions are correct.
Building department told me to stop my renovations. I told them to stop being 🏳️‍🌈🐻 and showed them my in laws kitchen layout not including an oven and now I have the green light to proceed, bitches!
Oh dude, gotta say you were dead on. A bit of a pull back today but holding $30 calls into next week
NIO, I don’t know what they’ve been telling you but it’s not true
no, you just lack nuance. I understand they have an app, and I understand their streaming charts aren't HTML.

My point is that they aren't hosting like 4k streaming video like netflix, or massive gaming servers like blizzard. People are fucking going and looking at a chart and probably transferring like 500kb of data. It shouldn't be hard to host servers that can handle it without crashing every 10 minutes.
ZM put for a month when we are definitely going to be locking down the country again.


Sounds good go with this OP
Guhhh
Told y'all to inverse me on my TSLA calls I bought. I have the worse luck.
AMD's back fuckers
[removed]
The warrant should be at a set strike by a specific date. My guess is they are telling you they can't predict the target co and whether or not those warrants will be itm ever.
sell AMD at 86 for the RSI correction and then re enter at 85-84
Well, hello GME...making a slow climb up...almost forgot about you.
AMD wtf?
PRTS is having a nice run-up : \^ )
BABA IS AWAKE
LAST CALL FOR TSLA TRAIN TO MARS, NO MOON STOPS
And thats why I stick with aapl
Bought high sold low Tesla twice, fuck
nah just asking about today whether you think it'll retest 250 again today haha. and I agree with you that it'll go up tomorrow
AMD????
[deleted]
I hope people bought the TSLA dip.
I agree for the most part that there’s an impending crash/ correction but relative to other economies, the US is doing fairly well rn. Yes the cases are high, yes the unemployment is high and yes the vaccine distribution is going to take longer than what the public believes, but the stock market is speculative and the speculation here is that the US will come out alright. 

I don’t think we will see any REAL swing in either direction until Biden comes into office and we finalize the house votes. That’s going to set most of the tone moving forward. For now, people’s assets are safe but should look to move to cash gang in a few months lol
25x PLTR $26 12/18 do it u won’t
Are you out of your mind? I am a long holder in this stock but there is 0% chance that 1 army contract brings this stock 5x. Govt contracts aren't even a big source of profits. They would need to bring in multiple big contracts this year to make the stock double. You may want to tame your expectations.
Imagine diamond handing your one Tesla call and later having it rug pulled 🤡🤡🤡
The fact that we don’t have a program to dispense weekly cash to businesses based off of their income statements for the preceding 12 months before covid is sad. It’s been 8 months. This country is a joke

 January 15/21 PLTR 20c calls
What message tho
people betting on the new ev companies to get a large part of the future auto market. some will obviously fail and some succeed. noone knows which ones
Now this is pod racing! $TSLA
The volatility is high, what positions are you holding?
Corrections start with $TSLA...
That pop on lack of news for PSTH just convinced me to buy more as soon as it drops back below 22
tsla puts 🤔

do I dare go against lord musk?
WHERE IS THE RETARD WITH SOLO CALLS ?
Holy shit AMD!
Did you buy puts?

F. I had 11 JMIA 16c that I sold Tuesday. Rolled some out and sold yesterday. JMIA just keeps rocketing.
Ha Ha real funny TSLA... now go back up
You'll know which one by 4:00 today

But without $10 kale shots for the buy side I just don't see how we can possibly go any higher

The only guarantee is that no matter what happens today you'll end up 💦💦💦 tonight

guys what is going on with AMD i'm scared
Make aapl great again. this is bullshit
[deleted]
False
bro you do what your risk tolerance can handle and what you know and understand. There is a reason people are posting 99% losses on here.
Can we get a sector rotation into BABA now? Thanks.
down goes TSLA...lol

Any news on AMD? Da fuck is going on
[deleted]
That stock is dead man. I realized my 98.6% loss. I'm not touching anything Chinese unless it's food or women and even that I'm skeptical
EOSE is primed to continue its 7% day. New battery tech seems to be hot right now.
I don’t think it will drop big tomorrow. It might be either flat or up
TSLA better come back or in writing Elon a very mean tweet
Tesla GUH
I thought dips happened in the afternoon
Make trading great again!
nice and healthy coil on spy rn
It’s a fucking need at this point
TA is what all new/naive traders use. Everyone thinks TA is useful when they first start trading. Then, as you get older and gain more trading experience, you realize it is utter bullshit. I thought TA was useful for probably a good 8 years before I completely accepted that it’s bogus.

spy about to dump

Milliseconds hahaha
1st option

2nd option sounds like a lot of ifs and things have to break your way.
Lotta people gonna panic sell TSLA. 

Rip lol
how many calls what expiry, howd u time it
They did this before covid
#Last time you see TSLA under $500. You’d be crazy not to take advantage of this dip
Was expected to go down a big with all the weeklies taking profit
What the fuck is AMD doing? Lmao stairs up

This is why I never touch tesla...

zoom 375 put
FU Putin . I am buying tesla more
I've been sitting on a 6/18/21 20c from your first post. The worst part is the $600 I was going to put into PLTR, I put in this instead, and only put $150 into PLTR since everyone here was crying about them not making profit for years.


I don't mind, this is a long term play, just wish I had freed up more capital so I didn't have to make that choice.
Next time friend!

Okay bounce now tsla
i am just sitting on 50K for airbnb alone rn
Buy more! Whales just making room for their buddies
Lol, let me know when Tesla can make an infotainment system that doesn't brick itself.

There seems to be a large disconnect between Tesla owners and Tesla investors and if Tesla cannot improve their quality, reliability, and services to their owners, they may just end up with a customer loyalty problem.
Will Chaynuh let BABA keep dumping? They're either gonna gobble up the dip or sell hard and rotate to other companies. What do you think?
So I just spoke to charles schwab about purchasing SRACW for the upcoming momentus merger. They kept warning me that you can't know what the warrants are for until a later date. Are they just saying this in case the deal falls through before completion or is there something else I'm missing? They said the warrants could end up being for something completely else and we don't know what yet. That seems odd.
AMD mooning 🚀🚀🚀
[deleted]
People are investing in too many consumer EV's and they don't realize that there is an amazing market for commercial EV's because there are really only two companies in it (Arrival and Rivian). Just bought a few hundred shares a few days ago.
AMD and INTC pumping. Tech rotation in full swing
Yeah,, hitting $85 is fucking epic
Remember that alot of people sold too late
AMD is killing me 😩
Do your thing! I’ll take the opposite

Don't listen to any advice here unless you like losing money.  But mostly be careful, there's a lot of bullshit and idiots here, it takes time to learn who has good info and who is a bag holder looking to unload.

Definitely gonna buy a stock that’s already up 30% in the past week.
This is the exact feeling you get before you lost it all the next time. Profit is profit
Key words "Hoping to get lucky" . For that reason I'm out.
There's a very large order that goes live when the stock reaches $85.00.  You can even see it on the chart.

It's holding it up.

Negative interest rates on PSTH, fuck!
longer term charts look bearish a bit but I could se a 1% upside in SPY over the next 2 days.
I think you are bang on except the timing. The market will keep heading higher into bubble territory before finally dropping. If you can see this so can everyone else and that means the obvious play is to go short. Once all the shorts get squeezed out and all that liquidity is trapped then the next leg down will start imo
give me a bulk discount

Oh yeah that's why I said three houses and not more. If he wanted to go full leverage he could probably safely buy like a fuck ton of 300,000 homes with a 60,000 downpayment each costing him roughly 1600 a month and if they have four bedrooms that he rents out for 600 a month he could pull in like 2,400 for each. What I said was pretty conservatives tbh
that’s flattering

Yes, unless you want to wait for funds to settle...been trading in it for about a month and I'm at $10 something in fees. Most of which is from options contracts.

PSTH WTF
is CHGG a thing?  some people love it.  buy shares for a year if you believe.
For twice the price.

I know.

I've been in the PC gaming market for a long time. Nvidia won't cannibalize their 3090 sales with the 3080 Ti. They've gone through a lot of trouble in the past to avoid that and won't start now.
I solid covered calls on PTON, FSLY, and ZS for a couple dollars above my cost average as a hedge against an economic downturn and then they rocketed like 200-300% beyond the previous ATHs

I fucked myself so bad trying to hedge
Just fucking go spend 26K on shit you don't need, help boost the economy!
Such a sluggish stock. If this keeps up I won't have to roll my 12/18 87.50c forward 😅
This is some serious AMD pumping...volume over the past 30 mins is nuts
Nah I’m holding onto this one
The rest of the market should follow AMD....just for fun.

I’ve heard that on an npr report on jumia and that when things are delivered people want the driver to stay there with them to make sure the product works before paying for them

But do you see more younger people embrace it?

I know half the population has low end cell phones but more and more upgrading to ones that can support the apps are you seeing it as well?

I know right now this is an insane short squeeze but I still think this might be the next SE 3-5 years down the road so I’ll be taking profits and reloading on long dated calls with the profits

Who just shit on walmart wtffffff
corsair, tesla, pltr. But like ASAP. The longer you wait the higher they'll go and the more you'll hate yourself. Don't trust meme stonks like chinese EVs. Whether they're right or wrong, they're too risky for a babby who just started and has 3k to work with.
$GIK is the next one. Halted today. Going public rumor is out

Good statement from him.  "Look at the 13Fs and decide if you think it's a good sign or not. Also remember not everyone invested has filed 13Fs"
explain gme i retard
not rly. i got +20% on solo today
It was almost me man
Final summary. Spoke for around 2 minutes. Basically said they can’t mention the IPO. The investors list speaks for itself. And they originally set a 6 month timeframe when talking IPO and that puts them at releasing name in Q1 2021 and they are on pace to meet that timeframe.
It was announced Money after hours and still ran up on Wednesday during cash session... no real excuse to be salty. I missed the run up too oh well.
Okay so buy calls, got it
Nobody wants to listen because they're bearphobic but thank you for speaking the truth
The Challenger rose at a very controlled rate until it suddenly didn't
The good DD and interesting reads may be gone, but at least WSB still gets the wildlife.
This meme never gets old no matter how many variations appear.
Well you see, someone found some old news about NKLA and GM and thought it was new news, so people bought more NKLA so the number of bag holders has increased.  Your puts are far enough out you'll be fine
What’s up with all these people talking about NAKD? Y’all think this shit is gonna rocket soon?

Well commercial loans are different. And you need to consider your DTI if that’s actually possible.

But yeah, real estate investing is definitely the move for building wealth
What are your positions?  Seem like a guy I would follow blindly.
People see that shit is fucked and have defaulted to the retarded "tech is safe!" mindset. Because for some reason, people absolutely refuse to short or simply sit on the sidelines. They feel like they have to buy, every single day.

It's the death throes of a huge downturn incoming.
[deleted]
That's a high margin product.
The AMD chart is bananas!
This is the biggest dip we're going to see on tesla. Now is the time to go in on it. The fact that such a steep drop didnt trigger a selloff should prove its strength. On top of that technicals signaled a strong buy as soon as it happened. People are buying. You should too.
Positions or ban
I'll be so fucking happy when the EV bubble eventually pops and this board isn't clogged with the same Elon cum guzzling commentary every day.
What a life to be able to accidentally spend 200k
The fucking title about it being a quick options trade wasn't a give away?
In this thread: OP ignores the possibility of further fiscal stimulus in the US and, well, everything about other countries. I mean, it’s not like he said US stimulus wasn’t likely with the current screwed up US political situation, which is an understandable (although probably incorrect) position to take, he just flat out ignored it. Also, there are economies out there other than the US. Some of them are even doing pretty well at dealing with the whole COVID thing. Major flaws in the thesis.
Today's fucking choppy, I'm just not gonna look at the market and hope for z best.
I do not think they will. And speculating when they do not some action on the price.
Ban this commie bastard
Someone from here probably loaded up on puts and a real player wiping them out

Why would you use your real name on Reddit? And especially on this sub?? You are a strange person.

Also, the market has been overvalued for like 100 years. What makes you think that will change?

Any dip buy????? Or it’s all bull run!!!
Got in at the top still holding though
Well I bought calls, and so far anytime I buy calls I lose money. So maybe switch to puts.
Ok hold up
Yeah I mean I’m fine with it. I’ve put 75 total in my account to fuck around wit and now I’m at 800. Might be gambling but it’s making me money so

Huge post and doesn't show any proof. Still has a day job so you clearly don't do well lol. Fucking retard.

TSLA 520 EOD
But you forgot that he has an Eagle Scout Award, from Boy Scouts of America. This changes everything. A super gay bear is telling us to sell, so obviously we inverse that. It could not be more clear.
Depends on the company and climate. Deep OTM calls on weed before election hype? Cool. Buying OTM calls on a stock that’s already run up 10% on no new? Not cool.
AMD has yuuuge problems with stock, even bigger than nvidia. Their raytracing and pr suck. Nvidia isn’t as tone deaf as intel and they will be selling Ti or super versions of their current 3000 series that will be even better in performance than amds 6000 series. Just so you know
18.50, I have no interest in this company but the hype will keep it pumping. I only care about the massively inflated premium.

I need FCEL to pump back up

Nah I'm not playing with TSLA anymore. SBE and CIIG are the new games.
Anyone else remember when this stock was $7000/share? Or are y'all on Robinhood and can only see 5 years in the past?

Now this is Retardation
I do it for growth-oriented companies I believe in. MSFT is what I’m in rn, have $275c for 01/2022
Remember to buy calls on friday to hold over the weekend to take advantage of the next vaccine coming out on monday.
Ever since I started taking profits where I could get them my account has been consistently green. Odd.

Fugg you Boeing
Saw some people questioning whether it’s more worth to exercise the calls at a certain point. I think I’ll take the profit around what I was talking about and maybe reinvest in CRSR, stand strong

Yeah this guy should buy like 3 houses and rent them out.
i guess calls on TSLA never goes wrong, does it
The thing that sucks about autistic fucks like this one losing money is that it doesn't really contribute positively to the economy. Like outside of this person's sheer comedic stupidity, him losing this kind of money doesn't positively flow into the economy.

At least when you blow your money on material items, no matter how fucking stupid a purchase you made, you're contributing to the economy. Here this autistic fuck is simply making money vanish (in the form of valuation dropping).

Losing stock money is like being a shitty magician i guess

Man i think im about to let yall have it with these options. To us common folk these are just lotto tickets. Some get lucky but most crash and burn. Thankfully ive gotten lucky more than ive lost money. But just knowing that more than a handful of people had knowledge about tesla being included in the s&p500 and being able to take advantage of it. Im not talking about how we were back in September before the crash and everyone was speculating but etsy got included instead. Im talking about people who knew for sure ahead of time.


Tldr: im quiting options until i find a forum on the deepweb or something with insider trading knowledge because im salty that people with real insider trading knowledge keep winning.

If not announced I am betting on a pullback. Then again if announced it will spike.
That’s not really a green day BABA. Please go to 260.

My frustration is people that buy weeklies expecting 100%+ gains where on the chart do you ever see that in a weekly basis? The only time you see 100% is when you’re weeklies FDs expired -100%. I know I don’t expect a lot from you guys cause come in here to lose money but learn how to read a chart and learn how to trade. Okay that is all.

Oh and for people holding share that goes for you as well don’t expect to become over night millionaires people that made money with hold stock shares make over YEARS with some exceptions of course.

My guy, this is your fourth bear DD in 2 months. Stop trying to make red happen.
Mortgage rates are basically 0 right now. It honestly makes way more sense to borrow as much as possible. You can get residential loans at like 2.5%. You can easily make more than that with the rest of the money.
Good now borrow your friends and family money and go all in on otm pltr calls to buy a lambo for your birthday. Or go tits up. I don’t know anything about investment or gambling or life in general so don’t blame me

When do you guys actually considering buying deep OTM calls as a viable strategy? I'm drawn to OTM calls cos they're cheaper and my broke ass can't afford 3 month ATM calls.
I have no idea what any of that means, just tell me what to throw my money at.
oooops, thx for tanking it
Elon you fucking bitch
But if you think about it, in just the right way. Isn't that the same as a month?
They expire tomorrow!  Bro the MM's got 11/20 pinned for max pain... RIP to your puts.
i could use a 23 to break even
I'm thinking about it, but don't want to challenge EVs anytime soon. I'm thinking about buying NKLA puts because it's a joke.
and down goes FCEL
1st day back after 4 months down 50% ahhh it feels good to be home
Could you expand on that? What price puts would I sell?
HAHAHAHAH. Seriously though, wait for 1h until ending to buy puts for only that hour, sell before close. And then calls again for monday
The most retarded thing I can think of right now is to buy YOLO calls so that’s probably the play. 74.1% of retail investors lose money so looks like I might be one of the 25.9%
Agreed. This is WSB. We can’t comprehend numbers without them being color coded

Looks like the bears are indeed headed down
Bigly
Guys, what you think about FUBO TV? Looks early and gets too little attention for being a small cap. But I tried the product and it works. It has a target market with sports fans, Latina fans, etc. And sports wagering will be part of the deal.
Cup and handle right below the vwap on Corsair. Feels like the pre afternoon bump boys
BABA is finally up!! ... .5 % lmao
When you sell AMD calls for a loss seconds before it moons 🤡🤡🤡🤡
An actual African here from Borno state Nigeria. In the most developed countries only a fraction of the population buy things online let alone know how to use or even where to buy a cellphone. Literally no one except for the financially elite (not even 25% of the population) make online purchases. Sadly, even some of those have trust issues with online purchasing.
But nio is great in reality
Yes exactly, and they are getting investigated for some type of securities fuckery if I remember correctly
ASIC miners, but even those aren't very profitable these days unless one has a huge factories filled with them in like the middle of Siberia.
You guys use margin on TOS? Is the interest rate really 9% or so?

Bro that's a lot of words. Nice pictures though, very colorful
PLTR $30c 1/22/2021
Fair point
States are already locking down and Trump promised no federal shutdown under his administration. Biden may be forced to shut down as soon as he enters office.
If JMIA hits $23 today I’ll shit
Every twink thinks their bear is the best, till a little to much K&M get mixed in. It always comes back to how much dick your ass is willing to take

Fukin hope so, I’m always choosing wrong
FOMO'd a TSLA call at the top
Wtf how, what strike did you sell at
It’s days like today that make you feel like a fucking pro at this shit. You just hope you make more on these days than you lose on the shit ones.

It looks like SPY is losing its steam. It's looking like it might be a red day very shortly
But how much of that is held by foreign nations and how much of that is bonds bought from the Fed (and thus USA owing USA)?
LMFAO
Telos just IPO'd - anyone looking into it? Cybersecurity firm working with US Government and Amazon.

Corsair and Under Armour
this dude honestly kinda has me convinced... ironically though I think there's a good chunk of us aware that we're in this bubble and just riding it out hoping to not get burned.

Like obviously my fucking NIO calls are supremely overvalued. but there's power in knowing the retards in here will keep buying.
[deleted]
I mean, EV's are hot, but that doesn't erase FSR's track record of being a completely and utterly inept company.
I've invested elsewhere and I have made money; I bought NIO relatively early. I still think Tesla is an epic bubble, but I don't try to predict when the bubble will pop. Elon is cool, and I love SpaceX, but he doesn't seem stable enough for me to bet my savings on. Also Tesla is worth more than Toyota, my instinct is to short Tesla but I've decided to not even touch it.
why? it's so strong
Do I close out my 11/20 AMZN $3100/3095 put spreads now while they’re at 50%, or hold for a little more tomorrow?
Could SOLO puts print? It’s up fucking 50% in a week
It’s literally been on the market since September, you fucking retard.

It isn't
I don't like the signs. I am selling my shares for a couple weeks and buying some puts. This is gonna get grizzly.
You are correct. But you said it yourself, " The market has become divorced from the overall economy."

The market does it what it does. The party will go on, with ups and downs. 

Does it deserve to be lower, yes. Will it? Maybe.
Just one more run up TSLA
Can you do an ACAT to a different broker?
opex is tomorrow and it looks like theta gang is going to slowly kill all of us on spy
Everything shot its load at open today, slow bleed out till close?
oh man..  I hope my retard hands get me out of this mess. spy and tsla puts were NOT the way so far.
I just don’t really see the bull case, 

1) lockdowns ahead probably throughout the winter. 

2)Whenever things actually do improve Biden puts into place his tax plan (already written out and is the largest tax increase in American history) that’s both individual taxes up and corporate taxes
Definitely the one where Anthrax did the music for the episode. Shit was fucking dope.
What price did you buy at?
Any news or just buying?
TSLA trying so hard for 507-508. You can do it you beautiful bastard
Yeah man, I dunno. I got run around in circles for about half a day. I had to get back to work so I just accepted it as a glitch in the system. Maybe I'll try to initiate a dispute in the near future, but at this point, that money is long forgotten. It hurt, but I could afford to lose it. Ever since then, though, I have loathed Fidelity.
FCEL dip looking like a snacc

I dislike the UI of WeBull, it's trying too hard to look hip and vApOrWaVe
Surely too early to call considering it's up a lot today and it's had several bigger pullbacks than this on the road to this current price.
Why is WSB so quiet about TSLA and the insane run up since S&P inclusion?
Same. I sold it all at 36.00 yesterday thinking I might have a good dip to re enter after that. Seems like this train has too much momentum!
I had 5 420 11/20s. Sold them for 17k. Today its floating around 50k. Never felt so shitty about 17k in my life.

Is PLTR ever gonna pump? I’ve been waiting forever
> Remember last Christmas Tesla was rocking ~425 then our boy Ellie released the cybertruck. Tesla flew to 600 by eow.

You're off by a bit. When the Cybertruck was unveiled on 11/21, TSLA was around $350, but it never broke $450 before the end of the year, let alone $600 by the end of that week.

****
Edit: Just checked the exact date TSLA broke $600, because I was curious - Jan 30th.

If anyone bought PLTR 11/20 calls that was a stupid move in the first place. The only thing I am certain of is that its future outlook until at least February is really fucking good.

How we feeling about $BBY?  Room for a big move post earnings ala TGT?  People are buying up electronics like crazy.
hey just FYI, i had this problem. RH is about to lock your account and ask for stupid amounts of information.


My recommendation, and what i did, was to get a real broker. and do an ACAT transer (automated customer asset transfer). RH can't say shit to you becuse the other broker handles it all.
Is this red? Looks flat as fuck to me
I feel like buying puts right now

With all due respect to OP and his DD, I’ll be honest and say most of us Degenerates here don’t know what we’re talking about 99% of the time.

I’ll be happy if I understands a line of what OP is saying. Heck, I don’t even know how options work. 

Alright, end of my story, $PLTR to the moon 🚀
No idea. I legit was about to buy $500 worth yesterday at like .14, but then I dug into it and it’s pretty much on the verge of going out of business. I haven’t seen anything to justify this growth
I agree with this. I have both. And both account is red. But I do like webull a little bit more. I feel like their transaction to buy or sell is faster than robinhood. I also like their charts and account detail to show how much I lost. Robinhood is simple and UI is user friendly.
Haha, I feel that I debated selling at 1.13 earlier, oh well! I think it will pop up to 40, just a question of if my options expire beforehand 😂

Bad play. Should've gotten the spreads when it was in the 440s
I have owned shares of PLAY since late March. My portfolio is primarily long. However, I believe by watching it in the past the 11/20 23.50 Put is a good gamble right now at .38. I have 8 with an entry of .19. In the past it seems to fall on option expiration Friday.
Unless..?
agree, Webul's layout sucks and my smooth brain can't understand it. RH is easy for smooth brains like me.

Jesus, can we at least get SOME chatter about stimulus. SPY really needs something, anything, to move.
Yes.
Actually there’s some companies that do let you self-direct your 401k instead of allocating your money in their etf. What you guys are thinking is a pension which is different from a 401k that one can not be self-directed.
You should post all your gains porn then.

Basic research tells anyone objective this entire thing is just bunk meant to rile up his base
Yep. Ran up from 400-500 in three trading days. Definitely dead.
It was a great stock to get into a week ago because it traded sideways for so long there were nice stop loss levels. I bought a little at $2.63 and just happened to time it but figured it could trade sideways a long time. Sold 1/4 at $4.97 yesterday. It reminds me of PLUGs rise. Bought that at $5 and sold at $10 because i was up 100% so quickly. Could be the same thing here but I've set more stops to take profit. Can't watch a 100% gain turn to a loss. 

I lucked into finding the stock basically. 

There are still problems with hydrogen. Why bother making hydrogen with clean energy when regular battery development seems like the way to go. It feels like more desperation to catch up to TSLA, but admittedly the play for hydrogen is more likely things like heavy equipment. Imagine setting up a hydrogen plant in Canada's tar sands and running the mining and oil extraction equipment off that instead of diesel. 

Go to Yahoo finance and look at the 4 year financials chart. Disaster. I'll ride the wave while it lasts and then probably not look back.

Same, selling some calls today and buying shares. Keeping some on sidelines in case this falls again. Same with palantir I believe in them long term but short term could go either way
fcel fell off a cliff damn
Even the BABA is green. Very interesting day.
I’m entering into both of them
If you bought the exact same amount of $SPY at open and sold at close every day since it began in 1993, you’d be down 10% all-time. It is up around 800% from its humble beginnings around $43. 

Let this serve as a reminder to you morons in the back; trade $SPY after hours and pre-market. Sell your options at open and buy back at close. This shit is simple.
Wish I’d done it before whatever the fuck is happening now
Now what's the tldr of the opposite side of your argument?

All the big money investors already know this. The facts are indisputable. The ability to have the can kicked further down the road is what I’m putting my money on, and why I’m still making bullish investments. This bubble is a little more transparent than prior bubbles and I think an exit strategy will easier if you’re keeping an eye on all of these indicators.
Then short it... positions or ban.
Started with $5k put it all into Sony calls in Late August. Ended up pulling out with $2k because Sony is a garbage company but with my PLTR calls I’m up to $6.3k

So, will be having two presidents be bullish? What was $TSLA doing circa 1860s Civil War time?
You & Brent are both wrong. You are literally a gay bear in the middle of a bull market. 

QE in and of itself isnt deflationary, its a monetary response to lower borrowing rates in the RESPONSE to a deflationary shock, like COVID, like the GFC.

You can argue that the response doesnt match the shock, so maybe you get NET deflation, however, if the FED did this same thing during “good times” it would def create big inflation.

Heres the thing, even if you’re right, and QE creates deflation in and of itself (which is ass backwards), perception is reality in markets.

Thats how reflexive relationships work. A La Soros.
If everyone believe stocks go up, then they do.

They might need to purchase 122m, or the equivalent, by that date, but there is no telling how many shares they either already own or are being purchased via dark pools. Because we don't know this number I don't think it is safe to assume they need to acquire all 122. I think it is likely they need far less. I don't want to give a truly astronomical prediction, because the very volatile behavior I predict will occur right before inclusion kinda keeps anyone from giving a solid educated guess this far out.

Everything he said is 100% accurate and will happen. 

The key is timing it. Unless you time it absolutely correct you will get fucked. Most people will not.
You say “I’m not a bear, I follow the market” yet all your posts are gay. What gives?
All of your premises seem good but your conclusion is not. The market is more irrational than ever, so it’s a bad idea to use logic and reasoning and complex shit like that to come to your conclusion.

The drop won’t just happen on its own. My sense is this is the beginning of a euphoric bull run, not the end. The only thing that’s stopping this bull run is an unexpected disruptive catalyst. At this point, election uncertainty, record coronavirus cases, lockdowns, all of these are expected and accounted for. So what kind of catalyst am I talking about? 

Well, who knows? It’s hard to predict the unexpected. My biggest concern is Chinese aggression or invasion against Taiwan during the American transition of power. 

Throw some uncertainty into the mix with these almost universal irrational valuations and we can see an explosive drop

If you have long calls the make a profit would it better to exercise the options instead of selling them?
There is no downside to taking his advice (outside of the options, in which case there is risk). The way I see it, there are a 2 variables: take his advice or not, he is right or wrong, buy options or not (as a subcategory of whether or not you take his advice). Broken down:

1.) he is right, you take his advice and buy options: make money. OR, if you don't buy options and simply pull from the market, stocks are cheap after the dip and you have tons of liquidity. 

2.) He is right, you don't take his advice: you lose 20% of your gains and it puts you in the red for a couple of months. 

3.) he is wrong, you take his advice and buy options: your options expire worthless and you are out proportional to your option contracts. OR, if you don't buy options, you miss a week to a month of market trading. 

4.) he is wrong, you don't take his advice: yeet, you got to stay in the market for a couple weeks with no downside. 

However, I have to say that his DD looks good. I know this is a meme-ish subreddit that fully encapsulates the modern fusion of entertainment and information, but his shit should be taken seriously, and there just isn't a proven method yet to go full bear while remaining memable until it is too late. I am 100% on his side here. I've been following Steven for the past couple months and he really does know his shit. He might be wrong, anyone may be, but I have good reason to believe that he is more correct in market trading than others. 

For me, I bought TLT (because I am stupid and risk-averse and don't want to get into options trading) at its low a couple weeks ago @155$ and I have only seen it go up ever since.

If you want my unironic trading strategy: I trust Russians when they talk about chess, gay men when they talk about art, and autistics when they talk about the market (related side-note: look up his youtube channel. For me, the fact that he doesn't shill it speaks to his integrity.) Steven is right, and if you want to avoid the coming dip listen to him. 

All in all though, you can't go wrong. Stocks will EVENTUALLY return back to where they are now, but many stocks still haven't gotten back to pre-lockdown levels. With all the market indicators AND the news AND this DD, I think it is worth it to pull back for a couple weeks until at least after Thanksgiving/Christmas. TBH, I am hoping for airlines and TSLA to take a nosedive so I can score some cheapies with (nearly) guaranteed long-term returns. 

Final point: Steven is worth listening to BECAUSE he doesn't day-trade. Day traders get too caught up in the ebbs and flows of the weekly shit; he does macro. I don't listen to him to know which specific stocks are going up or down, I listen to him to know general market trends (his Sunday night market charts are fuckin' choice, my dudes). 

To Steven: This place is a meme-zone. I can guarantee that the people who are taking your advice aren't posting, and the rest are still giving you shit because that's the meme (perma-bull). To draw from a religious source (gasp): there is a reason it was so common to say, "whoever has ears, let them hear"; it's just that some people just don't have the ears for this. Wisdom is wasted on them who don't listen.
Try NIO $55 or $60 expiring tomorrow.

I didn't say that very well.  Just the general concept of buying on margin.  Put $1 cash into the account, invest it in $2 of stocks using margin.  They go up 10%.  Sell, and now you have $1.20 in cash, doubling your gains.  

So, my stock picks went up by 25%, but my account value went up by 50%.
Yes. Even without the fixed, some pilots managed to disable the MCAS and avoid crashes. I’m sure practically every 737 max pilot knows how to disable it by now if needed.

Yeah I’m hoping for an EOY run up so I can collect fat OTM premiums. Tbh I was disappointed that they are doing a buyback instead of a dividend and i read an article where even I think it was JPM said “that’s not what we want, pay a dividend”. I think they know that they need to do something with all that cash and like you said, I’m hoping that will be the catalyst
You have spoken the word of God. Rkt is cursed for originating in Motown which still carries a gloomy hangover of 2008 crash and having hq in city that went bankrupt doesn't help it's cause.

There is no hype/publicity here to attract fancy hedge funds or big money players. There are loose rumors of grandpa Buffet sinking his dentures into rkt, but hey odds are he will kick the bucket before it happens.   It is valued at garbage and it will remain so for quite some time.

Ps: I yolo'd 28k into 12/18 24c for earnings play, had to cut losses and bail out with half of initial investment.

We are facing a runoff election in Georgia that will determine the fate of the Senate. The party will deploy it's massive grassroots campaign machine in the state over the next month. There will be new polls and a second runup, pricing a potential blue wave as we near the election, which will be decided on Jan. 5. 

To me, the most obvious play has to be cannabis, right?

TLRY is oversold at the bottom of its bollinger band.  If nothing else, IV will start trickling up shortly. Even if I'm wrong, this play seems low risk. If I'm right, it's extremely high reward. buying OTM momentum calls.  This is my official triple clown 🤡🤡🤡 buy alert

BILI up 20 fucking percent. Should‘ve held through earnings.
600 12/18
this was my initial read as well, but it did better than expected in earnings by a solid amount (still a decent loss). It tanked early, and then went on an absolute rip for a net gain of 8% from the daily low. since its 1dte i dont want to let it get out of hand in case it sits around yesterdays highs. I keep relying on it being macy's and therefore a company not really prepared for a covid world.
Only thing really worth watching is squawk on the street. Take Cramer with a pinch of salt but it’s as entertaining as ever

I cant. I did that 3 years ago with Personal Loans, Took me selling almost everything I owned to get my debt wiped out. I wont do it again... I will settle for averaging up every couple weeks with paychecks.
Old news
So maybe you’ve heard the bank of japan was buying OTM calls in the millions. This was raising gamma which means market makers like citadel had to hedge, they bought underlying stocks. Right? That’s how we got the huge run up of august now SoftBank is unwinding their balance sheet. Meaning they are dumping their calls and going cash which will force market makers to start dumping their shares.
Well, what you learned this week might not work next week. Anyway GG
I’m still loading up on 12/31s for one final play. I believe that there will be a catalyst that cannot be held down. I’ve heard a few people on here talking about them getting into auto loans or making an acquisition with all that cash they have lying around. 

The CEO was also pretty confused about the stocks price action. Im thinking that he’s scrambling to find anything he can to propel the stock.

Of course this is all speculation 🤷‍♂️
It’s consolidating now, I personally don’t see it reversing after consolidation so now’s probably your best chance to get in. But it’s WSB why would you listen to anyone here. So yeah roll a dice and toss a coin.

We’re going into the strongest 10 years the world has ever seen, the ones who didn’t get fired (which in the developed world is +90%) are fuckinf loaded on cash because they haven’t spend any cash on holidays or a new car in these uncertain times. When the vaccine hits, their wallets will be burning and they will try to catch up, causing tremendous economic growth. What then happens after the 10 years? Real estate bobble will burst, and it will be a bloodbath for everyone. Until then, gains should be made.

Can you support your last statement? FNMA has tightened restrictions on how long certain documents are good for (Asset and Income documentation now expires after 60 days instead of 120) but I wouldn’t say that makes it any harder to get a mortgage. Hell, in my experience, I think the volume of loans is the only roadblock. The banks in my area aren’t hiring for any positions aside from mortgage, and you have a shopping list of positions available with fat bonuses for those with experience.

Every stock I thought about buying pumping like a mother fucker while every stock I did buy is trading sideways for 4 months.

Every dip is going to get bought up on TSLA I am thinking

It is going to just keep slowly grinding up to like $550 then will dump after the S&P inclusion actually occurs

Because the higher it goes the more likely consolidation. 

And it’s been awhile since consolidation?

Spent 7 months of it staring at lines and numbers. Good shit.
I’ll only sell covered calls when I believe the shares are trading higher than they ought to and really wouldn’t care about losing my shares at that price.  I’ve got burned a couple times with CC’s when the underlying goes up 25% in a week and my CC was 5% OTM.  If I sell 25% OTM, I’m collecting pennies.  In the off chance that RKT goes up 25%, it’s probably equally as likely to go up 40%.  Potentially missing that extra 15% isn’t worth collecting $12. 

If RKT gets to $27 or so, I’ll start selling CCs at $30 strike.

Absolutely none.  I'm just going with my method of not fighting the energy trends.
Yea, fuck it.
The inflation is almost all in properties and equities.
I'm sorry to inform you PLTR already hit it's high of the day today at 11am est, as is customary most days. 

The correct play is to always YOLO weeklies 5 minutes before close, and if the stock gaps up overnight, then sell around 11am.  This strat would have had you finally eating 20 pack chicken strips

Use profits from first fd to continue daily yoloing with the trend until the music stops
Dude you are making bank man, glad I followed you into this trade ✌️

Why take such short expiry dates? if you really think its going to crash in the next two months why not go for march or april and just eat the theta?
The investment banks are shorting RKT.  Why?  Because they do all the loan originations.  And they know they're going to keep not lending.

It's getting harder and harder to get a mortgage.
Welp I’m out, up 30 percent on the week. Not great, not bad. I always take Fridays off. Hopefully I’ll have at least a 50 percent week next week

Let me throw a theoretical situation:  


Government decides on a $10 trillion infrastructure bill to boost the economy. The banks buy up the debt, hand the Federal government cash, the Fed buys up the debt using bank reserves, the banks can use reserves to make loans, i.e. they are in the same positions as before.

The only difference between this situation and the situation before is that the government will spend $10 trillion of money. Explain to me how this is not printing money?

The amount of people on here that just throw their money into options without knowing what they’re doing is insane. I get it you see that gain porn and you’re like why not me? Well heres why not you, probably bought way OTM and expirations around the corner because it was cheap. Better than pissing away small amounts of dollars at a time why not take the time and effort to put up a little more money and give yourself an actual chance and understanding of making money. Or at least be able to understand why you lost and make a change for your next play. I’m sure I’ll get shit on for trying to help maybe one person but whatever, this video is simple, short, and to the point Good luck get tendies
When they're ridiculously wide, yeah.
Exactly. It's getting irritating watching it trade sideways.
the stock probably until my march 5c expires, and then my dec 5c i dont have much of a choice, I dont want to roll it, theres cheaper buys at the point plus tax

IMO these analyst predictions are just pie in the sky pump and dump nonsense. Yeah sure Tesla might hit those numbers just as long as they have no problems at all and no competition at all. They've had tons of problems and they have tons of competition (which people seem to ignore). There are countless companies working on self driving, and countless battery companies too. People are pricing Tesla like it'ss going to have 100% market share in those fields, which is nonsense.

Cummins transitioning to hydrogen is a massive step forward, and I think a lot of other companies will step forward as well. Considering Cummins generators are in a large market share of work trucks, back-up building generators, and god knows what other shit the demand for hydrogen cells will sky rocket. If I'm given the option to swap my backup generator to hydrogen when my service is due, I would gladly pay for the service. I have positive long term outlook, but I think I'm probably going to fully exit this week and rebuy when the pump is over.

You bought at the wrong time - when TSLA wasn’t doing shit - and then got bored and bailed because you didn’t have a reason to be in the trade. Next question.
Yea the video is a little dumbed down, but I feel like they do it on purpose. Good luck!
Its a joke UNTIL it isnt... :)

I bought some for the fuck of it (I have wasted money on stuff before for fun)
I like having both because of the day trading rules. In Webull if you only trade with settled cash then there's no violation. But you have to work with the T+1 and T+2 settlement delay. If my settled cash is low I can run a play in RH and not have to worry about hitting the RH 3 day trade limit since it's not my primary.
I like the look of that, got any DD?

The government being involved in higher education accessibility is precisely what made education unaffordable in the first place.

This is a comment for the daily discussion thread
Gotcha. I looked at the April ones, liked the higher risk/reward pay off for the January one.

This is honestly one of those option plays you just sit on. They are hard to do if you are use to buying weeklies but I think this is a no brainer.
Investing in one shady Chinese company is enough and we all know which one that is.
Do other brokerages also just auto set your option buy/sell price halfway between the bid and ask? Because you can pretty much always get a better price than the mark if the bid ask is wide at all. Seems like a RH scam.
CRSR looks like its finished its bull run. What retard powered stock is next? JMIA has technology in its name and tech only goes up so that looks decent. Any other suggestions?

Their vaccine sounds great but data doesn’t come out until end of December. $60+ by January.
It's a solid meme generator because involving money into anything makes people go fucking crazy, and it's a pump'n'dump.

Literally anything besides tsla mentioned is like a ticking time bomb. If you're just now hearing about it on wsb, then you're likely the mark.
Id be really happy today if NIO came out and announced that they also have a vaccine that is 95% affective
He only regrets that people can read. Otherwise no one would know.
Also this SPAC is on the rise. #FIII  


It's risky though as it's all rumours atm.

Yeah it works when you actually have capital.
Please someone halp you ppl talk hieroglyphics and I just wanna know how much i'd make if I buy 1 contract PLTR 25 12/31c  and the stock on 12/31 is $25
Fuck u
Tbf college tuition shouldn't be THIS inflated to begin with....
somewhere in this thread there are retards who bought CRSR at the absolute top today
KNDI, SOLO, and FUV. Any call on these guys on monday would have made you lots of money.
before end of day. we have a strong support line at 17.20
Yeah I feel you there. I don’t try to make huge 100% plays, I like the smaller 1-2% returns that you flip quickly and having your capital tied up while a stock goes sideways fucking hurts
bout to lose her fuckin grip
Cough 2000 cough.

Excuse me
Finally...an article worth my time. this restore my faith on WSB...its been too much of gambler lately.

Thanks again OP with a yeeyee ass haircut for the DD!
The SPAC posts have been gems
Just took off

That number is reduced by 90%. In the trial, over the trial period, it was 0.44%, but that's not a property of the vaccine, it's just the rate the happened to see in their study participants over their study period.

The rate in the population at large isn't really relevant, and would depend on what time period you're looking at. The number you'd use to talk about how infectious a disease is in a population is R0, which for COVID is about 2. This means each infected person, on average, will infect 2 other people.

Since the study is done to answer questions about the vaccine, the important result is that the vaccine reduced the chance of infection by 90%.it is expected that this 90% reduction would apply, regardless of the pre-vaccine infection rate in the population.
Gyna ev is the play today
tsla just sittting at the supercharger getting ready to go 510

Only one letter away from NIO, sounds good to me
I understand what you mean

Right now is your once in a lifetime chance to YOLO SPY 355p 11/20.  The market bull trapped all the cucks this morning and this baby going to drill.  Sell at close for minimum 💯% gain

You'll never get another chance to YOLO these specific puts

How do I know you may ask?  

I just finished Toobin and was informed the Ann Taylor on 3rd and both Joe & the juices around Park have closed!
Waiting for it to dip further, maybe?
I sold those on the Tuesday dip for $1.40 ....FML
Funny, I've done well with WSB's picks and the sad part is if I'd be up an additional 50-75k if I hadn't sold early (AMD, FSLY, LULU, NET, PTON, ZS).  I missed out on some *massive* gains selling covered calls on FSLY, PTON, and ZS but that's entirely on me.  The v-shaped recovery really fucked my risk tolerance.

I'm really only bagholding EURN (I actually like this one), STNG, and XLNX (finally back to break even).

I think a lot of people would do better if they didn't fuck around with options.

Put hyg 18 december
ZM calls lets go kids
Saw the GIK news, saw an EV company, jumped in at the high. Oof these bags are heavy.
What are your thoughts about the fact that with interest rates at all time lows and the fed promising to keep them as such til at least 2023, assets provide the best return on capital? Yes the market is overvalued but where else are institutional and retail investors supposed to park that money?
Comparing the charts AYRO gonna probably top out at $10 after taking out the highs
That's the goal.

Puts on haircuts.
A good example as to how overvalued things are is the restaurant industry. Various chain restaurant stocks like EAT and SHAK are actually HIGHER now than they were PRE-COVID! The stocks have skyrocketed in the past month despite the state imposed restrictions that continue to severely curtail their profits, and are forcing some to teeter on insolvency. These restrictions while loosened over the past 2 months, are now starting to once again become stricter as infection rates rise throughout various states.  The result is a massive opportunity to short the restaurant industry.
Oof. Sorry fam :/ 

Hope you hit

Yeah but don’t just blindly buy and yolo lol use your brain when you read these
The big short
Current production ebbs and flows with demand

Short/mid term solution is to supplement current generation with storage, and keep generation on high during low demand times to feed storage.

And you're 100% right - increased capacity is a long term need... hell, California is having brown-outs during summer, and sending text message alerts telling people to cut usage.

Poppa Elon needs to get into nuclear if he ever wants to fulfill his world domination mission
Timing is like the most important thing. Sold my COTY calls weeks ago, same for my bank calls, airline calls, cruise calls, etc. Dang-o
So uh, is PLTR the same as that animal that gave everyone covid? Asking for a friend.

Man I really wish I could read
$22 and too much time.  Time is what really hurts, missed out on NIO and PLTR
If you bought this in 2007 you’d be down 99.9%.  I know from experience
Hahahahaha 🤣 you are so out of the loop
Stonks too high IMO
Psth on dip?
C’mon HYLN I know you can do it
These Chinese stonks are sketchy maybe Jack and Xi are going to BFFs tomorrow?
BUY NOW (Im huge palantir bull btw)
Peace be with you brother. 

Why not sell $30 CCs against the 2100 shares? That way it’s not sitting there doing nothing but going sideways?
the message is that we should keep selling TSLA puts
Lol for real

DD: when sectors boom it’s just the same money rotating, tsla -> nio -> solo -> ayro 

Better than CIIG with no options at the moment for maximum degeneracy
It just got upgraded you fucking absolute retard. It did not top. This subreddit is full of fucking morons.

Any a y'all played Among Us in VR? It's fucking hilarious
Got in at 19 bebe
Yes
I sold carvana at $32 when I bought it at $8 thinking no way it could keep going up. Obviously not the same but it went up to like $90 within a few months
Wow I actually read the whole thing and even googled the things I didn't understand (Literally have never done this before). 

TLDR retard version is: the fed doesn't actually print money they just take actions to make banks feel more confident and comfortable lending out more and to encourage borrowing. Banks, however, are not lending out more and in fact appear to be preparing for an economic down turn. On top of that, there are special indicators designed to determine how over valued a market is and as of right now the market is as overvalued as it was during the internet bubble. On top of that, things like unemployment that are a better reflection of the actual economy are still soaring.

 What I mean to say is, TSLA to 600$ by end of year yachts and bitches on my dick, have fun missing out on the gains gay bear.
Because you’re a pussy

Get out of here with your DD. TSLA to the moon!
Also, since we have your attention and there are other retards watching, could you explain the intuition behind the SPAC boom?
It's got a 2T market cap. A 10% move would be 200b. It's a basically where you stick money you want to save
Just depends where they wanna close it out for OPEX. Looking at volume today I’m guessing chop around to around $357 at close tomorrow. Moon mission resumes Monday.

Ackman said he has a breif update on PSTH but at the end of the call
thanks for the reasonable advise! makes absolutely sence.

Bc it’s up 120% in the last few weeks. Clean energy stocks are a no brainer with an administration (Biden) with a clean energy agenda, zero real interest rates, & speculative retail trading at an all time high. They’re pulling pent up investor demand all at once
Holy fucking quad top....gay and fake
I reallly need NVDA to stay above 530 fuckkk
Imagine buying baba stocks after the dip 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Its 30% up, how much more u want it to move.

Ain't falling for it
I thought about it when it was $25, but I definitely wouldn't get in at its current price
Why not? Market is as frothy as ever. Only reasoning would be a little bit of pinning for contracts. Way more call than put volume it looks like

That would be Theta. The 11/20s are losing like $2.50/day so $.30ish/hour.
im about to go all in on SOLO too late now?
17 year old who started on Robinhood at the end of October when the market had a mini drop. Went from 10k to 5.3k up to 10.7k last Friday and back down to 10k today. Not holding anything rn, just studying patterns and waiting to buy on red days. I’d classify myself as an options swing trader. But my dumbass got a 3 month day trade ban.
One more advice for u, avoid call for YY and BEKE, especially the second one, house rental is not worthy to invest anymore in China, before Chinese New year people will go back to hometown, capital chain may break.
Also YY is not promising like huya or douyu

I think they said they will determine if the buys will be spread over several tranches.
Time decay
Good luck to all you FCEL bulls! I hope you know when to sell truly
There’s not any one metric it’s kind of subjective... I just kind of go off my gut based on what I see. Sometimes I see it once and I know it will blow up, sometimes I need to see people talk about it enough before I really believe in it. And sometimes no matter how many people talk about it I still won’t believe in it. It’s not a black and white system, no such thing exists. You shouldn’t try to derive some formula from this, just look around more that’s all.
PSTH nose dive. Speculative traders profit taking or did something fall through
If you sell CRSR you a fool
Wife asked me what I want for Christmas. Can’t think of anything besides stocks.
He’s saying big words so in my book he’s right
Eh, ZM seems to have taken on the role of the tech stock most likely to be obliterated by vaccine news, of which there is plenty more coming the next few months.

There are a few stocks often talked about I have no interest in touching, and ZM is one of them. Plenty of tendies to be made with it I'm sure, but I'd feel safer if I liquidated my entire life and put it all on Red at roulette.

Plus, I feel like a lot of what's pushed ZM up to these levels has already priced in a longer term national school-at-home scenarios which isn't the case right now.
Looks like a 20% move..... neat.... you ever try weekly options?

Time to let her ride.
The only reason it isn't over $20 is because Soros is unloading shares cuz he's a snowflake.
you won't be fucked if you take small profits along the way.
They just IPOed and earnings were fenomenal showing that its undervalued
Lol. Expect it not to dip until after dec 21

I remember when I had below 25k in the upper left hand corner under account info it would say how many day trades I had.
DRILL NIO
337 unfortunately. I think that one is gonna expire worthless.
Everyone's talking about PLTR...you know what that means.📉📉📉
interesting, I thought they just build software that integrates an organizations various data streams and that Palantir doesn't personally have the data.
AZN trying to break out
they have one its called communism
no storage is not the problem. the creation of energy and energy transfer across huge areas is. I just read article how if UK has to go zero oil cars in 9 years, they need to double their energy creation output by then. even if they planned 30% of by then existing cars be electric its not possible. 

now who is building new powerplants and energy transfer networks? not Germany and France who are planning to shut down their power plants instead ... noone is thinking about the infrastructure because there is no money in it
I'm your Venus I'm your fire your desire

That's the thing dude. How many times over the last fuckin year has there been "a market crash". All the fuckin cucks are waiting for it. Yah there are strong indicators, which I believe most of us know. Even the autist and retards. But the thing is, there is always a reason to go higher. 

Even now after vaccine news dissipates, there will most likely be a dip like you suggest that will bring everything to real term but that will most likely be only 10-15% at most. 

If vaccine news is positive and people can return to work retail and energy stocks will continue to rise. 

The whole reason we crashed in March was because we didn't know how the pandemic was going to effect the market. That uncertainty is what fcked us sideways. But now, going forward we know what to expect. 

Is the growth going to be slower? Yes. But because companies will still grow will result in more pump into the market. 

Just my fundamental opinion. Im not a major smartass. And yah I'm watching SpongeBob now, and jerking off to my gains
Shit man idk. People fuckin love SBUX.

The stocks that have been tanking on earnings "beats" consistently are way over extended on their forward multiples tho.

Went to check SBUX tho and nvm their multiples are kinda dumb LOL. P/S way under apples tho
HAHA WTF I didnt get a prompt :(

Baidu planned to buy them out before this news. The fact that a company might buy out the company still for the share price of last week is keeping it up. If they announce that they’re postponing or all out cancelling the buyout then it drops to the floor hard. If they don’t then it instantly recovers to the. Buyout price

I believe since your adding to your current amount of contracts, no matter how many you sell, because you bought atleast one contract, it will count as a day trade
i think it already reversed when tsla was included in the S&P no?
That little bite of ice cream after he reveals his positions killed me

I kind of love it when there’s a legit company that actually makes money, kills on earnings reports, and their stock doesn’t go up.  It’s the clearest buy signal you can ever have. It will go up, at some point.  Holding about $12k in shares I got around $22 and short puts.
yes
Go to history and count.

Geez it’s just money
ya DFS is a solid company, but you only have one bank stock (JPM) and SYF is more a pure savings and loan play than JPM while still giving you finacial services.  I use DFS and SYF interchangably so if you already have a position in DFS keep it and keep building.
Yes
MM to-do list:

1) Make SPY look like kang gang day

2) Pull rug
i must be the only person losing money on every tsla option i buy

Sold TSLA at 505 made 60% on my 520 1DTE call purchased around 492.

It probably will go higher but god damnit I needed that fucking money to keep me in the game.

People that reference a live stream and don't link to it are, in spirit, Nikola bulls that bought at $90.
Cash 💰 Gang up 1100 on the week. What does everyone think about airlines? UAL is down thinking of grabbing 2000 shares with new president coming stimulus and fda approval on vaccine I feel like it’s a win win even if covid numbers get worse. Holiday travel?
I got some 250 calls expiring tomorrow. Currently up a big 5%. But Fuck it. Holding through earnings.
Ayyy atta boy!!
Another day of Market Makers trying to holdback the tsunami of gamma thats unwinding right now. Trying to dump their shares off slowly. Been doing it for weeks running out of time now that SoftBank is liquidating.
After looking at GPRO, I can't find any reasonable reason its down 10%, going to continue to inverse this market. GPRO 7.5 calls lets print!

Yes gonna be great for my leaps
every single TSLA dip getting bought instantly
I think it's called sector rotation. We need some musk tweets to reverse the flow.
PTON monthlies the play? We goin on lockdown again for suuuuuure
How much more can this piece of shit market pump? We have been pushing for new ath every single day for a week without a single pullback. Where the fuck is all this new money coming from?
WTF FCEL is a 2 billion dollar company and at one point was a multi-billion dollar company. I have a feeling we are about to get a nice pump like it did in the dot com bubble. $4,000 stock ---> $5 I sense some value atleast to $6.50 thats 30% returns. Some option level goonery without having to pay the price of expiry

Just sold my calls for 189% gain and bought a put. This morning. 🤦‍♂️
Reportededed for insider trading
What we are seeing right now is tesla being priced in for the inclusion. Those fat fucks can't buy all their shares at once so they need to spread it through the entire month or else they won't be able to unload and buy puts after the inclusion.  
You are fucking right about those calls. Don't get greedy and sell before the inclusion, the IV crush will be fucking unreal on this one. +50% is better than than -50% unless you're a freeloading autists who don't care about making a livelihood.
Nice

What is the root cause of the student debt problem?

  
I see that pricing argument a lot and it's so short sighted. It assumes that the government will have no control over negotiating prices with schools. It also ignores a more healthy incentive for cheaper diplomas as those schools will be pushed/advertised by the government, while expensive ivy league colleges will have to justify their pricing accordingly.  
It's also literally just a first step to address the greater problem. The goal should be that anyone can get a higher education without finacial burdens.
When is TLS IPO?
Tesla is allergic to 508 lmao
They locked us down?

Good for you. I got out of JOY when they were down 27% yesterday since they would definitely rebound after a 30% drop. Didn't think they would rebound halfway but thats why you dont hold for too long after huge movements. Also about 100% gain

>I cant fucking believe you typed all that just to be wrong. There will be a dip. Never a crash. Will not happen. People freak out and say March was a crash and 08 was a crash. No. Just dips. Unless the world is ending or there are zombies, stocks always go up, the U.S. is a powerhouse for making money. Always has been. Always will be.

Less consumer spending=less liquidity is deflationary. FED actions are inflationary, it's just that deflation is strong right now. When we see more liquidity from consumer side, we will - together with quantitative easing - see real inflation in the coming years. Just like after 2009.
Looked at it yesterday and if it’s a pump and dump it’s going to be brutal.  If it was 6.5s that would have been better.  Seems like pennies in front of a steam roller

Up 100% on my gay boomers commons with CRSR... Sell half and turn in to calls time
Alot of buying and selling going on like huge amounts of trading. It might be running flat the whole day until it gets closer to end of day.
Hey man why don’t you get a bit more confidence and get locked in for a LEAP SPY 220p instead, if a crash was a crash it would fall harder than it did in March
[I am going too hard.](https://i.imgur.com/fFND7VJ.jpg) Fortunately this will force my FOMO to rest a bit.
ZM did it, now its your turn PTON

Not gonna say NIO will end up like the Luckin Coffee fiasco, but there will always be that SMALL chance for manipulation of information to mask things over to make something look better than it really is.

Never in a million years would be buy Tesla at this price
half the shit you used as "evidence" isn't even true, plus the obvious issue with the yeeyee ass haircut. Im buying more calls now
I am in 450 11/27
facts, dont understand how they went public at only 1.8bn mcap when they have over 1.5bn in revenue, +60% revenue growth yoy and positive net income... only negative thing about crsr is that they have a bit more debt but thats it
Options cheaper than stock tho
For the love of god you idiots. Stop having paper hands and selling your PLTR. Just ride the shit to the moon. Trust me.

When people realise arrival isn’t going to be producing anything for years there will be a slow bleed of investors bored at the lack of a price action. You have a year to get in before we see anything meaningful - wait for a pullback
My bear brothers and sister's out there, I hope you're doing ok. We can't all make money -- you'll get em next time!  


I'm willing to sell you some more puts at a discount! what would you like? Maybe short SPY even though it only goes up? or are you interested in taking more of elon's cock next month?
make your own decisions
PLTR is doing pretty damn well considering the market downtrend today

Preferably down
Looking at your previous post is funny. Its like Noah trying to convince people to get on his boat, but people don't listen to him
There is literally inflation everywhere... do you think a new car cost 30k 30 years ago? Or housing prices are the same? The market is literally way up right now BECAUSE OF INFLATION!

RKT is NOT a pump and dump. Is it a bad stock? Unfortunately, yes. But Rocket is a solid company and Im still scratching my head as to why it doesn’t move.

The first earnings report dump can be justified, but I don’t think the second one can. Im not just saying this because I got heavy bags to carry. :/

I just own stocks, too poor for options. Pls take your financial advice from a cripple on welfare - rumors have it IPO coming in around 6 months. I'd probably do $280 08/21C as a conservative play but I could easily see $280 and higher in a few months. 

All it is gonna take is any articles TALKING about an ANT IPO relaunch and it is gonna MOON because historically people can see it went up like mad leading up to the last IPO launch.
we don't speak of that name around these parts

Hope you bois have a good weekend
$100
i cashed out @ $505 for shares and 100% for my 12/18 $500 call just couple minutes ago, i know it'll continue to run, but i'm paper handing due to potential share dilution (SP500 inclusion has known to cause companies to raise capital and dilute shares, i think google and some other big company did it) and a pull back, if it actually dips somewhat i'll buy again, it's been running for two days now, i feel like it won't be a linear run up to 600 or whatever by Dec 21. will watch with cash for now, thanks!

Why did you buy a put on FIT ? They are in the process of merging with Google. This was announced last year ([https://www.axios.com/google-fitbit-deal-pre-post-pandemic-merger-eca12d38-0b77-4ffe-8a1e-579eda9f92e5.html](https://www.axios.com/google-fitbit-deal-pre-post-pandemic-merger-eca12d38-0b77-4ffe-8a1e-579eda9f92e5.html)). Their stock prices won't fall below $6 unless the acquisition is cancelled.   

Are you betting on the acquisition getting cancelled, or are you a retard ?
Youre safe here in the tesla train good sir. Dont worry.

even if it drops, incoming SP500 introduction will make for new highs. Sure it's overvalued, as the entire fucking market is. It's not gonna drop more than 20% now, 500 has been broken when 450 was gambling a couple of days ago.

The retarded FOMO portfolio
all this focus on TSLA when NKLA is actually up more week to date
If the stock stays up for the rest of today don't the put options fall more? If it's a fraud why is it up 18%, where's that coming from? Would you get in today? Why or why not?
I have 200 shares and usually sell calls when it's over 215 and sell puts when it gets close to 200 (though it seems to floor a bit higher since last earnings, maybe 210-220 is the new range now)
Deere doesn't make money on lawnmowers dude, it's mostly manufacturing and farming which is all down the last 3 months. Plus the Midwest being hit the worse right now from Covid has also affected the market.

Wtf are you asking
Its boomer numbers
That's fair. It's still not a good idea to ask 'round here, I've seen dudes downvoted to hell for less. I know we have a circlejerk against that here, but perharps asking on r/investing or r/stocks related subs would be better? I advise against going to single brand themed subs, though. The tesla sub in particular is pretty delusional. (Personally, I can't help much. I started learning under the guidance of a person I know, then moved on to online classes said person suggested. But I'm still learning! Haven't made any risky plays yet because I know I'm too stupid to even do that and would only lose money.)

Dude. CIIC just sounds like a pump n dump. That being said, I’m totally in.
Selling credit put spreads at 450 just in case we see a 10% drop in the next two weeks so I can still trade it and not be too scared lol
got me in the first half ngl
Short tech long gold is my play
Early or late for CIIG?
bruh that is literally how the market works. Big money makes their money off of little money. And trump is be the one to say "fuck it, let it crash" because he lost. Under Daddy, the markets did something no other president can do. Because of this they will support him in 2024. Take profits and come back later for cheapies
should i sell this 230 WDAY call up 30% before earnings
guys if you don't buy fds and buy shares/leaps instead you actually make money. It's true I've been trying it out
NIO bears in fucking shambles. NIO price target 60 now lol imagine NOT getting in early

It amazes me that people go through a Reddit account post history to try and find dirt in a fucking internet argument.

Sold 4 $40 11/20 calls yesterday when they went down $60 like a BITCH. Mf contracts are up 375% today
Hey I'm wishing you the best. I just was done with the ride haha
ded? fslr +4% today
Interesting. Yeah, I guess that is something which I had not considered.
Wtf are those numbers I can lose way more than that in a week!!
RIP...now that it’s getting SP500 inclusion...there’s no looking back.
Fuck it, more calls !!
Reverse splits
Got in on ZM at 420.69, extremely bullish
I got in at $1 for $2500. I am looking for at least the previous high of $4 by Jan/Feb. Then I will sell and move on to the next undervalued play that has room to grow
Can any retards in here explain to me the price movement on RIDE from 10:15am until now? Is the price wall at $29 driven by algo trading unloading shares based on a pre-determined price?
$40 or 50.
Retail has always been retarded. But so has smart money this cycle, which has missed the rally by being bearish.

The reason you don't see any bears around here anymore is they all went broke playing fundamentals like OP, whose points aren't bad, but have been completely wrong since March.
I bought at IPO, and sold some covered 45cs otm for december thinking, "there's no way these get assigned"  


I'm probably getting assigned >\_>.  But I'll be up like 200% so whatever lol
Time to stagnate for an hour

Time to hit it again
Agree. WSB needs to pump it
This is looking like the old TSLA wherein Thursday to Friday were absolute face rippers. Can be hard to hold when she dips but that IV FOMO drives up hard. 

Personally? 550+ tomorrow EOD.

We’re gonna be rich brother
answer a question for me [http://www.strawpoll.me/35148301](http://www.strawpoll.me/35148301)
OK. OK. Fair point.
600 eow?
Give her time. Lets hope for another squeeze
Tesla should split 1:5 ngl
Using Toyota is fine, but the method of comparison is the issue. Yahoo finance says Toyota current market cap is $195bn with P/E ratio of 8.59, so that backs out to earnings of $22.7bn.

Tesla current market cap is $476bn with P/E ratio of 960, so earnings of $0.5bn.

The argument you’ve presented is that to grow to an equivalent market cap by 2025 they have to go from $0.5bn to ~$20bn which is where you get 40x from. However if Tesla actually grew at that pace there is no way they would be valued on a P/E of 8.59 in 2025 because the future growth from 2025-2035 will be higher than Toyotas growth from 2020-2030. I’m not sure Tesla will ever be valued on a multiple of 8.59 at any point in the next 30+ years to be honest, given the sector they operate in and the anticipated exponential growth opportunities of EV’s/battery storage/driverless vehicles. This is why I say it makes sense to focus more on just absolute earnings than the P/E ratio equivalence.

Even if we stick with the 40x multiple, Tesla could still achieve this level of earnings increase without needing to increase revenue by the same 40x amount if they instead can increase gross margins. It might be that they only need closer 35x or 30x to reach the same earnings equivalent. They’ve outlined the intention to expand into software as a service with has significantly higher gross margins than traditional automotive.

Undoubtedly Tesla is already heavily priced in but there are Tesla bulls that predict $21 EPS in 2025 which would correspond to the 40x increase you desire.

Here’s a price target of $21 EPS in 2025 just from the autonomous business, it does not allow for driverless cars and/or energy storage:

Aside from the current market psychology of "lets run up every cheap stock that has some kind of brand name behind it?" yes and no. intel has a 10% stake in it, which was already enough for me.

published 20 hours ago, this thing has just started
Thinking about getting some longer calls
Price target for CRSR? Might have to exercise these options
The 2 most recent times Tesla issued more shares, their stock actually went up for the few days following the announcement since this strengthened Tesla's chances of having enough cash to survive for longer and gives them more money to spend on Terafactories.
Definitely needs some viagra. Unfortunately, we have a lot of limp dicks in this sub rotating in/out right now.
Why you have a hard on if we get on NIO or not? You want us to buy your decaying calls?

Sold part of my position at 40 for some cash for other investments. The rest I’m holding because for some reason NIO isn’t dying and I love it
Managed to fish out a position out of a black hole to only a small loss, so incase market collapses atleast a second black hole wont appear.

Imagine being excited over a small loss lol.
That’s what these pussy experts are saying. Not reality.
I keep buying puts.. how high can this thing go lol

The more shares of TSLA you have, the less shares is available for indexers/large institutions to purchase when inclusion happens 1-2 weeks prior to Dec 21st leading to higher demands = to the moon. You only have to hold the shares to Dec 21st.

I just own a ton of shares. Not that I’m in for a long term hold, but over the next 6 months I think there will be enough news re betting and increased subscriptions that this thing can easily double or triple. Such a small market cap today, lots of room to run.

I just wish I had bought in at 395 like I did with the other half if my money
TSLA gonna close 520 easy
$1MM 401K guy lost $13K on PTON

Missed $100K on CRSR

Ouch
Do it
I have only one question before (while) I buy   500 PLTR 11/27 30$.    

What movies is this?
Prob good for a short squeeze but it’s becoming super overvalued. I’ll regret not buying in a few days.
You know why if you’re honest with yourself.
Tell him to show us his puts🤡🤡
Thank you
How much money did you make on that?
Tf you talking about
[deleted]
I got off at 17.53 hope I didn't get out too early
Already have 500 shares at $13! Thanks!
Ah fuck. I never look at wsb DD, I guess I should
I literally said two days ago that TTD 800 calls were the move and then just didn’t buy any for some reason. Peak retardation

I sold FCEL at $5.95, I did not want to fly any closer to the sun
You have to buy the Northern Wastes DLC

The only options that regularly make money.
It’s making me doubt my position as well but I’m still holding.
is that for the reason, your gonna try and profit off a company with negative income going to positive income?

When will the inevitable “stock price too high” from papa Elon himself come?
any CRSR calls??
Supposedly they make batteries for EVs.
Lmao I had some 11/20 TSLA calls that were bleeding me dry then the magic happened and I sold for profit, totally lucked out. My December AAPL calls, praying they turn out the same way
Nah. 1/21 7c has 20% chance of profit. Bought some yesterday already up 100%
If there's a gold rush then sell pick axes....

Just opened a position in IIPR. REIT that provides space for marijuana growers.
Fd puts or calls tomorrow?
Stay at home is up, tech is up, spy up.. what exactly is holding us down?
I love Tastyworks, everytime I see SPY is "Hard to borrow" status I know we're about to run. How can these permabear dumbfuck retards possibly have any money left?
Pltr does this every time. Morning sell off for paper hands. Diamonds through lunch then sell off for profit. And repeat
Yup did so. Cus i saw his post history then saw this post
What a time to add more BABA puts !
People are taking profits
i don't know man, economy is not on a good track right now, and that directly affects mortgages, rates low or not, plus i don't see this as being sustainable in the long run, i would actually argue right now they are better than they would be, because currently low rates are fueling higher mortgage application rates, can this be kept up for them to keep growing? I will watch but won't enter at the moment, i just dont see something sustainable long-term to drive the growth.
What positions?

CRWD looking good. Meanwhile, I wish I theta-ganged AMD.
we eatin' today, boys!
Why is nobody talking about CRSR here? About 10% up every day this week :)
The only constant in options is the stinging regret no matter what move I make
What's up with solar
HCAC the next meme stock?
No lie
More than likely it'll be the day after Christmas.

That's the day benefits run out. Than rents and mortgages start coming due. Than January is when colleges payment are going to start up again.

All that combined with what will probably be a very lackluster retail market for Christmas sales?

The country is going to shit the bed. Especially if McConnell holds on as leader of the Senate and continues to stop any stimulus from happening post Trump.
Me but moved into NIU
Pics hoe
I bought a handful of PLTR 19c 11/20 when it was 18.2
Longer term options. Typically a year or more.
Need to open up that third eye mate, humans are irrational
NIO is about to not feel so good.
Pretty sure the only one coming up short is you :)
I mean if that’s a covered call that you have a $150 cost basis against that will net $3k even if exercised. Not a bad play. Plus the few hundred in premiums
Aapl has been shit the last cpl months there's better plays
Im going to go balls deep $15c Exp 12/18 god speed retard to tendie town
They make mice n keyboards they should be 10 bucks

#PLTR waking the fuck up
Idk chief you’re trying to apply logic to a market that’s been booming despite everything going against it. We’re just in a bubble ride it till it pops
EVs are the future, buy stonk seems rational enough for me
I had not seen that, just looked it up.  Chuckled a bit
I wish I got in earlier...
Plenty of time. Stay the course!

JD dip
Next stop after 506 is 509
i bought at 90 and sold at 120. i sensed it was too high when it was 130 and decided to sell take that profit. good luck to you.
NIO about to lose all it’s momentum... F
You will love stocktwits then
Im 1 for 6 on PUT prints, am in one now. I never learn
After people profit take pltr nio will go again. I swear people are cycling them.
Because 789
Congrats and fuck you
NVDA just announced really super strong results. Of course it’s red, duh.
yes very good argument. This is why i'm overall bearish AMZN. But hopium is rampant.
Not a loss just a missed opportunity
So PLTR contract was already in? Im not seeing much huge consistent activity
It’s being manipulated up to 18 which is the price of the new stock offering.  I don’t think it’s going anywhere
Don't tell your wife
Bought more Tesla calls
Lol idk why but this comment made me crack up
💎 hand plug 11/27 calls?
Let’s say it’s enough to buy hot dog, booze and hookers from a nearby corner.
Thanks, that makes sense. You could have also answered by just saying I'm retarded.

# WHO PANIC SOLD PLTR LMFAO
Literally every ev is green. What a time to be alive.
I see EV, I am all in.
you could have had LOGI when they were in the $30-40's for over a year, coulda also had gotten into U when they IPO'd
Nothing much, what's new with you?
DKNG gonna absolutely crush me
I think it’s time to take a long BABA position
pos?
Called it. Pltr just needed time. Can’t believe yall were nervous lol
We really goin to 7 iyo?
Whoever's new to the tesla train we got strippers in the back and champagne in the front. Enjoy your stay.

I generally agree, but the window for this is small. First, the fed has never truly tapered, just slightly, the fed balance sheet stayed up through like 2012, and they really can’t unload anything without crashing the market. Second, the moment dollar velocity picks up, the market will moon, in real terms? No, just that $4T of money supply will hit it hard and a beer will cost $10 even in poorer parts of America. So your dates look prime, maybe even go 12/31 or first week of January for a bit more time. After that we get stimulus, then shutdown, or vice versa. And you may as well be throwing darts IMO. Also I like your $350 strike for the downside. This sounds retarded, because it is but SPY 12/31 $350p, SPY 6/30 or later $450c. The only thing that’ll keep inflation down is if foreign countries buy USD like crazy and given we have been a shitshow that may not happen as it has in the past.
I made 10k in about two hours with Tesla calls. It's your sorry ass' fault for sucking Xi Jingping's weenie the poo.
11/27 105 got faked out, shoulda got 12/18 105
downvoted

Damn bro! You called FCEL when it was only up 120% for the week. Fucking genius
Mans you posted all this just so these ducks can skim over it, call you gay, and then complain that there is no quality on wsb anymore don’t give em your effort. Not worth it bro
This cuck didn't even buy at IPO, he bought in after it almost already doubled. I bought at $15, Yolo'd a whole $45 dollars. Amateur hour gains over here. Eat my 150% gains, and ability to now pay my electric bill.
Ah, good job pltr

gotcha. well I can only think to buy calls on small caps. but yea if you have a lot of stock, especially SPX, then buying puts as a hedge would be perfect. dunno exactly when and what price to buy them for. 

Also, check out DG and AES. They're the two stocks I have positions running on. I expect AES to be at $22 by 12/18 and DG to be at $224+ after earnings.

There's plenty of ways to exercise inside besides doing something that was designed to be done outside. Like riding a bike in place for hundreds of dollars.
Yes sold early, but also reentered after the run-up on the fake dip
So pretty much every EV is green expect Fisker?
I mean it’s the new level of autism to look for Wall Street subway exit on meme post that has a satire flair lol

I wouldn’t bet against Deere after everyone spent more time at home. People I know have been more focused on their yard lately.

Lowe’s and BABA are both discounted and both good companies. As someone who owns rental property and has a home and spends money at Lowe’s I always like betting on Lowe’s.

11/20 CRSR 40C  will be printing at the next dip today.  All aboard
PLTR has awoken from her morning slumber
Didn’t follow. Just calling them out
Got some 450s 11/20 on Monday. Flipped them for 11/27 450s yesterday. Which was weird because they had almost the same premium.
Imagine playing anything besides EV stocks this week 🚀
If it was an experiment we failed

Up 200 percent over the week, gonna take a break from the market before I throw all my gains away.
Yeah at 354

What do you guys think about M, makes money, and with christmas comming, thinking long 10c
Odd. I have Interactive Brokers. It’s on the Toronto stock exchange if that makes a difference for you.
I'm holding long.
Man I'm such a pussy lol.  I'm a pretty big PC gamer, and I knew ALL about CRSR when it was set to IPO.  Knew how big and popular they were in that realm.  Yet, I never bought in like a true retard, and it has over doubled in barely 2 months since their IPO.  Was such an obvious and safe bet if you knew anything about them.  Why do I continue to just sit on the sidelines with a lot of this shit...
bot 5x 565c for 11/27..
Trying to buy puts on GRWG
Sold my ITM and bought some more 90day $20Cs
Now I just need a 2% run up
Ban
It’s alright bears, get em next time
Really unsure what to do with TSLA positions if it starts reaching towards 540 price targets if you got in before the massive pump from the S&P500 announcement. Good time to sell and re-enter from inevitable market pullback maybe?
You diving in? Currently holding one 11/27 430c but the IV is nuts
not a horrible idea
I'm looking for something to hedge against a correction that could happen any time in the next 6-8 months. Not necessarily a short term trade.

That’s right TSLA, you know how to hike!!! 90 degree inclines are shit, all about them switchbacks! keep goin bb
OP is right, there will be a squeeze and price will continue higher since SP Funds will need to rebalance and buy Tesla.  The question is who are the ones selling all these calls?  It can't be all retail.  It baffles my mind because over a billion dollars in calls were bought yesterday.
Then grief
Thank god, I think it hit its head this morning.
You guys are like retarded stormtroopers left over after the death star blew up. Go. Awayyyyy

Crazy how easy it is to double your account when you’re down to last 340 bucks. Why couldn’t that have happened when I was at 15k. Fake and gay

If you bought TSLA 11/20 OTM calls on Monday and held all the way to today, you are a supreme giga chad. Jesus this run is crazy. TSLA's got its groove back.

I swear to God I'm never playing baba again. Fuck that stock in particular.

You’re 100% correct on it’s not about money part. Not sure your message will reach TSLA bulls though, they only hear their calls printing money. BRRrRrRRRrrR

Cough chinese stock cough.
You can probably buy a big mac meal at EOD
Me and my homies hate downard movement 😤
Uhhh SPY?  I think you are going the wrong way...the country is about to lock down again and small businesses will be destroyed
Donnie is getting ridiculous at this point.. just like MSFT and AAPL
DKNG, CRSR are my best friends.

I am down on my NVDA shares for earnings.  Going to buy an AMD graphics card now.
I sold my 545 FD for only 150 a few days ago when the stock price was 408. Cost me 5 bucks but still would be worth 360 rn
Lmao still going through post history to find dirt only to come up short?

4 encounters btw from fucking babes. Believe it or not, hot chicks like meeting randoms to fuck around with on the internet. 

You’re still sucking dick?

This is not DD. You can't just like someone else's post and include a sentence.
Alright, I’m hopping back in.
I've been talking DKNG for a week - all DKNG bulls are gone :(
Don’t look now but kndi is creeping up and up 👀

It would make a lot sense for these SP Index and ETF's to load up on a bunch of calls and then execute them to hold the shares, to minimize the risk of the stock running to $600+ prior to 12/21.
Yes please
Where you think it’s heading today?
I see nothing that looks appealing rn so ill just watch my money go up on corsair alone I guess

Anyone in nflx
While buy the dip of boomer stocks has had good returns. I am gonna start listening more and more to WSB autists for all-in YOLOS. Could have double my money by now.

Haven't seen a wrong prediction here, even when the stonk shown weakness still moon'd like a shooting start within 1-2 weeks. Insulting stonks also appears to work charms to correct trends.

What’s up with CBAT this past month? They’ve been stagnant for so long until now.
so do I buy in or what
Why does it have the words "The Challenger" written on it tho?
So I found this 5 minute video about DNK on their website. I can see why someone would want to acquire it after Americans didn't want to buy this stock because it was a Chinese Company. DNK sits at $2.50, Id say at least buy a $100 its 52 week high was $13.  [http://ir.danke.com/](http://ir.danke.com/)
SPY day trades saving me from my dumbass earnings plays, a tale as old as time

Good move!
Institutional investors are coming out the woodwork angey and salty they no longer have a hegemony on the market.

I’m to the point where I’m literally gonna inverse my thoughts
Riot
Dkng $41 monday and now $50 and no one talking about it
Got scared, sold everything and put it in tesla shares


I'm just here for confirmation bias now
Or, this news is all just true.
I’m going to be honest with you. I have no idea what you’re talking about. I use the active trader pro platform. The active trader desk, which is a team in the fidelity call center that specifically works with clients on that platform, doesn’t open until maybe 8:30 AM. So before then you will get a normal stock trader that isn’t specifically an active trader. Both of those teams literally sit right next to each other. So a normal trader still knows very, very well what ATP is and how it works. The managers and help desk associates are all former ATP reps. And they all use ATP too. ATP is a platform that is owned and operated entirely by Fidelity. So there’s about a 0% chance a rep AND a manager told you they didn’t support or know how ATP worked. 

And either way. A trade dispute is a trade dispute. Even if you got a normal trader and didn’t get to the ATP desk, you still can initiate one.
CRSRs volume way above average today - anyone got any insight into what that generally means when it's not based on any news?
With the amount of hype that surrounds it no one will care about the bad news until either next week or a few days before it actually joins the S&P
I didn’t short TSLA but man is that stock doomed in the next year. If it didn’t split that shit would currently be +2,500per share. The psychology of the split is truly incredible.
How can CRSR be legally green every single day
A lot of investors that missed the IPO myself included don’t want to get in before the lockout expires so we can see what the stock price looks like after employees sell out
It’s not TSLA
508
msft bounces between 200 and 220 since like forever... every few weeks the limits might move up a bit but its pretty predictable
TSLA really gonna hit 600 by end of Nov huh
Buy calls for mid 2021.. more time to expiry kind of slows things down
Once NIO pushes past 48 its going up to embrace 50 like an old friend

How it worked for me was I got about 600 bucks a term in extra loan money. You're SUPPOSED to spend it on paying off your loan, as the loan company sent the college too much, but if you're retarded you can yolo on massively OTM FD's
I do and will do more. But there’s no reason I can’t enjoy trading ... it’s fun for mex
True.
Tesla pump til $1T market cap
That means everyone wants cheap shares to accumulate.
But as an exit position if you waited 2 min it would’ve gone up again for a brief window
As long as I can hit 10k and not fumble along the way I am happy. Dont get me wrong, Im happy rn, my chart looks more like a miracle than anything else lol. But I set a goal of 2k to 10k so I wanna hit my bar I set for myself.

Yea but that was a long time ago. He was unbanned after the mod revolution.

what im looking for is a lesson or a source of info for more short term oriented trading.

I've been doing the common investing with shares etc for 4-5 years and I think I got a hang of it long term, but I've only tinkered with options 2 times (with succes - probably luck) and i'd like to create a system that can actually sustain itself, but I find it hard to get info on stuff like this on the internet.

does this group provide that?

Whats the play here? At what price do we get in and when do you expect it to go up?
I'm too poor for flair. I tied up almost all the money I could into various Canadian gold and silver mining companies. I felt real smart back in August...but now I'm just another bearish cuck.
I bought this morning. I’d still get in right now. If you don’t have the cash or risk tolerance for naked calls buy a big fat debit spread imo.
I’d make more money licking stamps than trading options

The economy is going to roar next year as people get vaccinated and case counts drop dramatically. Practically everything will be open again by summer 2021 and there is tremendous deferred demand for travel and leisure activities. Unemployment will evaporate. Interest rates will remain historically low at least thru 2021. 

There is literally nowhere else to invest if you want more than negative real returns on your money. Yet the market is going to tank in 2-3 months max? 

GTFO. SPY more likely to be at 420 by Q2 2021 than at 350.

soul cycle just came out with their own bike for home workouts bro. competition doesn't let the king sit for too long. nordic track and ifit platform has taken off too.
They identify as female. That's how they prevent being gay.
Just sold PLTR calls and went all in on CRSR 40c 11/20
Cant read for shit when do u think it’ll crash?
Yep rolled my 17.5 calls for Friday into 12/11 20C there’s gonna be a big run up pretty soon
That’s what I got. I feel like SOLO is just being pumped too.. but now I feel like I’m just sitting here watching it continue to take off and I’m on the wrong side of the trade. Idk. We’ll see
21st century capitalist western civilization is a complete dystopic existence, change my mind
Buy the rumor
Still holding my long calls and shares.
Great DD
NEXT LEG UP on TSLA coming up
Soon
Someone instruct me how to douglas
Clarity isn't required on the antitrust regulation. The draft is actually fairly concise and mostly revolves around merchant exclusivity agreements and predatory pricing.

Predatory pricing is a non-issue for BABA now but they did partake in the past when pushing AMZN out of the Chinese market.

Merchant exclusivity is the main one that would affect how things are currently done. Both JD and BABA have extensive lists of exclusive merchant partners but it remains to be seen eliminating this would have a material effect on the business - it seems unlikely.

IMO the real issue is the FUD around the party targeting Ant/Ma/BABA in particular.

Some of that is true but has also been true the last 10+ years, CCP and BABA have had a love hate relationship for a long time and small disagreements like this aren't new.

Ant IPO suspension was called for. There a number of reasons for this, namely passing of new draft legislation that would significantly reign in asset backed lending. If the IPO had proceeded then the legislation landed then public investors would take the hit and it would delegitimize the new capital markets CCP is trying to establish.
Also unregulated fintech of the size of Ant group is a dangerous thing, they are right to put the screws into it even if it adversely affects BABA shareholders (I'm long BABA).

So basically it just boils down to sentiment and fear selling. Price will probably return to normal in a few months, legislation will land to little or no fanfare next year and we won't even remember that is what caused the massive sell-off.
Stop chasing YOLOs, FDs, and MEME stocks.  

Aim for 1-3% a day and do your own DD and only make one or two plays at a time.

Most of the posts here are college kids playing with their birthday money anyway. 

Suggest buying 100 shares of a company you like and sell CC for a bit until you build up confidence again and are ready to jump in.
What's aapl
Yes sir! Grew up in SLC. Went away for college/the navy, but still go back for most holidays. Looking to ski there this winter. SLC guy?
They destroyed earnings and are undervalued
Congratulations 🎉
Great info. May the chips fall where they may. I went mostly cash tuesday. Rona caught me to many times. Holding spy puts and vxx calls. Let's rock n roll.
I love how most of y’all are so thirsty for DD but y’all shit on every post no matter how good or bad it is lmao. No wonder everyone who used to post is gone y’all are too fucking retarded to appreciate anything
Imagine not owning any- this is the most sure way to make money and some are still skeptical
I have no idea, I’m not even approved for options because I don’t want the temptation lol. I haven’t sold a call or put against my shares, but that could be a smart thing to do for this year since it’s pushing me into such a high tax bracket.
Literally arrived to the same conclusion. PDT is abysmal. Sticking to WeBull for fun plays. Might even open an IRS with them too.
TGT taking another shot at that 173 life?
Just hold it an you'll be just fine <3

Rn it’s showing that pton is a good long term option. Perfect time to buy actually.
Vale vale vale
What do they do?
The markets have recovered and faang is near all-time highs. There isn't going to be any big movements anymore on SPY. Look at what happened to NVDA, still massively up since March, beat again yesterday, but down only 1.34%. We need to find new companies to make money off of
Rumor is Berkshire Hathaway is building positions in TSLA rn..
Just keeps going up. Was waiting for something lower too.

Fuck you MSFT the minute i close out my spread for a loss you decide to reverse, cool. fuck this game.

Buy calls
Buying calls on one of the businesses deemed essential in a pandemic, proved they can still make a profit it 2020 and its one of the places older older people 30+ spend their time and money.

I know it’s not an EV stock (I own those too) but I can tell you they are a solid business. It may not moon but it’s going to go up. That’s my opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own.
Never
FCEL $6 Call 11/20

PLTR I have medium short term faith in. I am in for $500 shares at $17.8 after hours yesterday

Saved half to average down if I get the chance
Bought calls on NIU. one of the few EV stocks that hasn't been pumped to the moon yet. They're a chinese company that makes electric scooters and according to my friend who lives in china everyone is switching to them. Not to mention how everyone rides scooters in china instead of buying cars. IV is super low at .1, it just got reported on in CNN today for the first time ever. This is gonna be a winner I can tell

EV is so hot rn, the option premiums are through the roof due to IV. It is a bit of a risky play though, shit could drop at a moment's notice. I'm selling covered calls, rn have 11/20 $7.50 (which they blew by today, but eh profit is profit) and and 12/18 $10.

I believe shorts will get involved, so "flat" is unlikely, expect volatility per usual
History actually does repeat itself. Look at mrna over the last year. Each major spike is due to positive news.

TSLA coiling up for volatility squeeze. Which direction it breaks out in and when idk. My guessing would be to make an attempt at next retracement level 524
At this point it's going back down to $9

Wouldnt it be more accurate to say the delta/gamma are how fast the options depreciate. IV crush is more like the event causing the uncertainty happened, so either money is exiting the position or just the underlying has moved. So there is no longer implied volitity, it has already moved.
Fomoed into coty jesus christ im retarded
NIO, we going to 50?
Credit Spreads: Do I want it all? Or is 50% good enough. The dilemma I face daily.
CRSR
How was I wrong? He posted how he got from 750K to $1M. He never stated in his post that he started at 40K. I assume you check the post history for everyone that posts?
5 contracts. The rest is in shares.

Thank you for the actual answer. Well said.
Buying calls at 44 and puts at 51 is the easiest way to make money right now.

Why is everything dipping

It’s risky but this happens with every spac, DPHC (RIDE now) went up to over 30 before merging. Arrival has strong prospects and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it broke 30 within a month or two based on hype alone. It could have a sell off soon but that’s a tiny blip in the long run. I think if you make 100% sell half and hold on to the rest for the long run
Wanna see it happen again

SPACs are great short term plays very risky holding after merger
DKNG up again today do I see..?! No shit... why am I not fricken surprised. Not sure if you know how to read a graph (I’m sure with your IQ that’s intimidating to you but give it a try little man) up 20% in the last 5 days. I would say that’s not bad. I wonder what happens to options held when a stock goes up 20% in 5 days and its still going.. hmm. Make sure when your finished cutting all the neighborhood lawns this spring to sweep the driveways as well. Stick to what you do best ted and anything involving numbers clearly is not your sport. Best wishes! XOXOXO

LMAO Do not short TSLA

This is just day 2, still plenty of time to go before S&P inclusion. I would be surprised if we didn't hit $550 before then.

Fucking $3000 pre-split price. Insane and this is NOT the first test of that price level...
Bought 4 TSLA 495/500. Already sold 2 up 100%. Hang on to the others overnight? Is TSLA staying above 500?

I swear to god I've read this post 15 times this year already. Muh PE or GDP, muh debt, muh unemployment, muh retail...

Word. Not good today.
“Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed. All great countries are destroyed. Why not yours?”
Forget the pump and just dump this shit. You fuckers have been trying to pump this shit stock for so long
Unsure if joking or not, but this really has looked like a thing this year.

EV stocks, now PLTR, DKNG -- whatever's the hot topic seems to get a lot of buying power.

I mean they each have merits to buy up in the long run but the people putting money in has to be thinking 'ope, the idiots from WSB are piling into here best get in too while it's the flavor of the week'.
I’m just gonna hold, next week expiration. At this point
You can make money off wsb, just interpret the posts correctly.
It was on the Fidelity Active Trader Pro software which surprisingly, Fidelity does not support or something like that. Everyone I talked to (including some support managers) didn't know what it was/how it worked.
So MSFT is a recovery stock now? Guh, can’t win

and this right here is why I hate bears. "Market is gonna CRASH. Well, no I don't have any short positions, it's going to crash anywhere in the next 2-24 months, but when it crashes it's gonna CRASH. I mean yea I'm 30k deep in OTM NIO calls but EVs can't miss and they will be CRASH proof."
If you’re profitable. Sell and roll it out to farther expiration higher strike.

As far as I Know they are the only Chinese Ev with permission to sell to the US and just the other day, Texas approved rebates for their vehicles. I think out of all the meme evs this one actually has a real chance at growth besides pump and dump.
My own are in my hands too. I am up $10k on it since I spammed it earlier this week on WSB and got shadowbanned
Broke out of channel from last few days. Up 7% already
Pltr bear trap. Watch what comes next.
whenever you sell a stock you realize gains or loss and it has a tax impact.
You live a dangerous life. A true WSB autist
After I should have cashed out pltr calls yesterday, I don’t want to make the same mistake twice. But crsr has be mooning every single fucking day
Tesla just hit ATH
Wtf was that CIIC drop
AAPL and MSFT are post-menopausal grammies
Highly depedent on the next few months. The company has a lot of debt, and just did a dillution. They are still looking for funding even though they have been around for a while. 

It could easily hit $20 by mid next year, but also I think it's starting to get pumped heavily. Especially now with more and more posts on here about it. Best advice is be cautious. This is a really easy one to day trade options on right now
selling algo turned all the way up on ciic :(
Yolo TSLA 510 EOD calls
30c 11/27 jesus that's retarded

🌎💧=😢

What were the results?
See? Your retarded ass jinxed corsair
Yo for real do I hold this TSLA 520 call expiring tomorrow or sell it. This is my last Yolo
Rotation out of safe haven stocks to meme stocks
True to form.

Happy gambling.

25k account balance.
Goddamn I just want more PLTR under 18
When someone tells you they bought TSLA puts, you know they’re either new here or retarded, but probably both.
Lol did you buy puts?
Sorry, only shitty for ~gamers~ then.
Huge gainer of.76%
Alright who bought CRSR 4min ago, show yourself, you owe me 2k in unrealized profit
I guess that guy that betted thanksgiving dinner on TSLA is alright now🥴🚀
dat drywall work behind Malone doe
3:30-> let’s go jump in Tesla..oh wait it’s fading. Get Boeing instead. 

4:30 pm-> shot -30% on Boeing 0dte. Sell...oh my god Tesla wtf...jump in at any cost...-10%
600 eod
Had CIIC order for 16.50 for 500. Shit was at 17.50 then dropped and filled. back to 17 in 5 seconds.
That's a 5 bil minimum market cap  by 2022. Leaps all the way, baby.
Do I cash today or ride the wave tomorrow
Oh. whoops
Made back what I lost yesterday so good I guess.

SPY 345 EOW.
If it's a covered call they already have the shares or their clients do. I'd it's naked then yes they have to buy shares.
Also what’s taking palantir so long tryna get my $20s to print
Bought 150 shares all on margin.
Shocked nobody's been talking about spce slowly mooning the past few days
imagine being the person who got TSLA 500c's earlier this month when TSLA was sub-400  

💀  💀  💀
buy crsr dip
#TSLA 

As long as we continue holding $500, our next stop is $511
Tsla needs to blow through the ath and then it won't stop.
LOL at that chart interpretation, just going to completely ignore the breakout between 2nd and 3rd "rejections"?
You think people in here know how to play theta?
Did you guys notice market manipulation on TSLA by CNBC?

I am convinced CNBC is working together with MMs and shorts. 

TSLA shot up again and they are trying to crush it with the news like "Consumer Reports no longer recommends TSLA model 3 due to reliability concerns"

Blatant attempt to save their shorts.
that DOW pump and dump wasn't artificial at all...
Probably tomorrow
Plug is another great clean energy ticker to look into
Babies*, not baby’s
DPHC -> RIDE has worked out very well for me 🤷‍♂️
520 EOD I quit NNN.
deer in headlights gang
Nah, they make some really decent RAM gear at decent prices besides the glowing keyboards and gaming stuff.
Crsr go back up or I sell like a loser
And realized gain will be taxed (so if you sell for a gain no matter how much it is you’ll be taxed)
You’re telling me. I owned a 25c 11/20 but sold last Thursday
My weiner.
Maybe if I had listened to you yesterday, now I gotta wait.
How’s everyone doing?
From -60% to -37% on my Baba calls. Proud of these hands 🤡
Tl;dr
Ban. No flair. No positions. No... anything really.
I bought the dip at $45 after seeing through all that citron bullshit. Now tasting my delicious tendies

I saw corsair when it was at $23 and knowing it's brand I fucking knew that shit was gonna keep going up. It kills me the most knowing I didn't have any money to put into it and still don't have any to throw at it lol

That’s literally like everyday
What’s up with solo?
Fuck it we about to buy 250 DNK & about to ride this dip up. It’s a Chinese Airbnb & wework company (just acquired this company yesterday). Only others Chinese company with two verified SEC earning filings. One of the few China stocks that’s not complete dog shit.
Every minute of holding TSLA feeels like 2 hour have gone by.

You were saying...  jk. Bought them in March and I sold them for 10 cents yesterday. They have been worthless for months.
I think I’ll watch that with you, I posted about it but missed the run bc of no funds at the time. So I wonder if I should just go ahead and jump in now with at least a June 2021 C
500 is now the new TSLA support lel
One can hope.
694.20 is the next stop
Allows consolidation
Too long. Downvoted
you are smart!

You fools who doubted ZM

Tech sector is up bcoz of TSLA. Small cap is up for some reason.
Yeah that makes sense
Did he just call his employees "Palantirians"?
TSLA obv. Just broke through it’s 52 week high
Sell BA puts or are we goin down more? That squeeze at open about broke my balls
Dalantir my favorite stoock
If you got your losses back, capitalize on that man... give yourself more time to make money by rolling out lol

Everyone is yelling CIIC but i have a bad feeling about it

Damn, I hope so.  Holding 6/7c out to Q2.
When Tesla fell below $400 I was wondering if it would be a good buy. “Nah I said, we’ll buy in at $250. Like the old times”
350 methinks
No chance
BABA finallyyyyyy 🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀
U.S. is months away from civil war, the entire world is locking down again. A great depression is coming and yet you have a bunch of degenerates throwing money at TSLA 800 and NIO 100 calls. What a time to be alive.
CRSR making me sick
this is exactly it
China’s game is expanding their global presence in every aspect of society.

It’s far more advantageous for them to vehemently support NIO, rather than fleece Americans.

I sold btw
Who broke PLTR?
I'm happy to see this sub finally embrace body type diversity.
You could say it's almost... Zooming

😮🕶️

YEAHHHHHHH
spy either gonna be 350 eow or 360, no in between
Solid post.
TSLA broke its 52 week high entering a buy zone. 620 is the new 420
exactly my argument for when i bought it at 20
Got in and out of AMZN nice and easy, free gains right there
Diamond hands r fun until u look in the mirror several years down the road and realize it wasn’t just ur hands that became stone cold..
will tsla ever see the 400's again?
[deleted]
Define "facetious"
Here comes BABA!
just buy it. it's gonna keep going up dude. fair value is $25 a share
Thank you, are you the one they call "MM"? 🙌💯
SPY 348 EOD or what
Why is no one talking about FUTU? Chinese Robinhood’s runnup is crazy
Would u rather have BABA leaps or NIO leaps
Well made a decent bit of money off TSLA and PLTR but it looks like CRSR and TWLO were the moves at open
 🚨 TESLA ABOUT TO BREAK ATH !!! 🚨
PLUG still feel like they need to have a better long term plan.

PLTR looks to have huge investments for long term so it may be more viable after this current rally. 

CRSR may drop soon due to people wanting to take profits, however still would be likely to keep growing. (As gaming is never really gonna get smaller.)

That’s my hot take atm but it’s always worth doing your homework
I love when you watch an option price increase 100% in 30 mins from open but you just watch it increase instead of buying. 

Made to many bad decisions this last couple weeks so nervous to jump in. Fuck me
I have a very bright outlook for all clean energy tickers, mainly due to the change in presidency in the United States
Ohhh my baby JD 😍
What's actually hilarious is that corsair products are kinda garbage.
[deleted]
God speed
Why you say that?
Buy PLCE. During covid lots of people are having sex (not you gays).  Sex = baby's.  What do baby's wear? Clothes! PLCE gonna moon
Got 50 6.5  for next week
Sold half my Baba this morning, you’re welcome
[deleted]
Lmao the dip is literally the stock NOT mooning 10% in a day and only going up 2%.
Ok everybody now you can FOMO into CRSR
"I'm not a bear..." yea okay.
Sounds like ur the cuck that's mad at their big dick energy.
Same fuck it.
[deleted]
Whats the next market moving news fellas? I’m going with aliens for 5000. We need some friendly alien news to pump this market!
You missed the biggest argument. When I buy any stock - it usually dips. Since I just started investing just 3 months ago, it makes total sense for the market to crash and my money go ‘poof’.
a nice 30% day going all in on 1 dte amzn calls
694.20 is the new 420.69
Don't get shaken out of 🍉. This is only going to keep going up. No matter the price, index funds are going to need to buy for the Spy rebalancing as early as Dec.14th if it's in two tranches since the market cap is so big. The smart buyers are holding to drive share price up. The idiots that don't know what's going on are selling for small gains or those that bought in at the previous top and are short sighted. Hold and watch this keep going up as there are less and less shares to go around.
✈🚁🚀🛫🛬🛩🪐🧭
Now for DLTR to moon
I am definitely not a TSLA permabull but this is such a good time to get in
[deleted]
At an average purchase price of $0.01
this isnt March 2020 lmfao
imagine selling TSLA
If we never sold we wouldn’t have to worry about taking profit
thank you for the free tendies my goodman🍻
CIIC is moving at a 15.89° upward trend line just like from yesterdays open
What is the fucking play fuck
who is that old fart anyways. why do ppl take advice from ppl who are about to die any second now

You guessed it right, I'm PALANTIR
But we can still get tendies to go for behind the Wendy's? Right?
nah
the hype lasted literally 1 day
Alright what are we throwing money at today?
This is the type of rage i like to see on here
With the stupid trades I've made today I deserve to lose money
BABA up an entire percent, prayers have been answered
Unemployment rate isn’t sky high. It’s at 6.9% as of September, and probably around 5-6.5% as of today. This is higher than 2019 levels, but lower than 2013 levels.

Another factor that you missed is the shift from small-business to big business during the crisis. Stocks by definition represent only the larger businesses, so part of the valuation relative to gdp has to do with a shift within the economy that’s not captured by raw growth/decline. In other words, big business can organically grow while the economy declines because the losses are mostly felt by smaller businesses.
For Tesla TSLA we are going to reach Morgan Stanley target price of $540 soon, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when we're going to reach it.
Ive said it many times but i dont know how stupid people can be here. 

BABA tanked because of the antitrust uncertainty. 

It will not go back up before there is antitrust clarity (and news are not bad). 

For fuck sake, get this into your tiny retarded skulls.
BABA im at work chill these are new pants...
Sounds about right haha. I got mine for $5.50 before earnings. When's your exit?
BABA 🚀🚀🚀🚀 FINALLY
cant yall take your sympathy play to fucking pfizer.. just let moderna fall.. ffs
Why do people always downvote my comments? Are a few upvotes too much to ask for?
I'm having a shitty day and this thread has made it 100x better.
I legit learned about the company yesterday lol
yo somebody needs to tell tech stocks its a red day lmao
It obviously runs on an RTX 3080
Is there really this much demand for TSLA at these prices or is it just algos tossing the shares back and forth to each other to create a bid/"stable" price at these levels?
shit is destroying my account
SBE LETS GO
I have 5 options and 30 shares. Should be a fun ride.
I did last week, 50% but stilll holding

If S&P is up and NASDAQ is up, then MSFT is up but underperforms market
Nope. When one closes, you switch market.
Aapl push me to the edge
Thought this same thing
I called the top yesterday and got 5 messages saying I’m wrong
This might be a bizzaro play but NERD gaming etf goes up like 2 dollars every month since pandemic, with winter, holiday and uptick cases/shutdowns approaching, might take a little 2k jan 15th 27c, currently sitting at 26.52, it'll surely go above 27 at this rate right? can someone tell me if this makes sense/why NERD doesn't show after hours trading on google - i posted this last night, and was waiting to buy on a small dip and still havent bought - the one time i do dd :( already trading at 27.30
Buying 10 shares every time this dips to 17
BABA waking up or faking us out?

Corsair only goes up!
Lmfao bruh 99% of what’s posted here is a constant pump and dump. Unlike meme stonks like TSLA,HTZ,GME, this company has solid financials. I’m not trying to be rude here, but do you have anything concrete to suggest it’s a garbage stock/company? I have my own biases but I’m open to being convinced otherwise
And prime day....
How many contracts did you buy?
Trust your gut. I also think its due for pop soon with Black Friday & cyber week around the corner. I'm holding my Jan calls for now
ETSY gonna be at 140 by next week

My BA puts are printingggggg
Pton will moon
[deleted]
LEAPS when possible, especially as IV reduces around 255
PTON didn't drop because of vaccine news though.... if you read a bit, they are having extreme issues with available inventory. They don't count orders as revenue, only after the order has been delivered. they are backordered by months at this point and they are also in 2 lawsuits right now. I really really wish you didn't do PTON man. There's a reason it went from $130 > $100. I do wish you good luck but it's not gonna move much in a few days. You should've just stayed with CRSR. Currently another +10% day.
Yep, you're right. I just love FDs. Gonna try to turn a new leaf.
prob untill mid dec. they cant fk up the xmas season it would fk up the whole quarter
I mean as far as I'm concerned no matter what silly analytics u use there is no way to actually predict anything, so why give advice? U know as much as anyone would wether they have been trading for decades or two days.
Easiest play in any market is common sense and knowing the risks and not these dumb ass drawings on charts.
I may be retardet but not retardet enough to believe u   (or anyone for that matter) can calculate the market.

I am a freeform retard 
I trade without knowing anything and realistically I have the same chances of making bank as you.
Lock gains and get marked?
Go look again and tell me im wrong
So the only mainstream news on PLTR is that George Soros thinks it's evil, and not that they secured a DOD contract?
Bold of you to assume I can afford a tv
VIX really fucking with us rn
This is probably a good time to go all cash isn’t it

You're way too late. I've been playing it for months, it's way overextended. Any large market pullback (especially rotation out of tech) is gonna tank it to $30 again.

If you make profit on this, take your winnings and move the fuck on...before the merger happens.  SPACs are frought with all sorts of weird shit and risks that your average retail cuck has no idea about. They can be extremely complicated. Don't bag hold like an idiot for the merger.  Take your wins and move on quickly.  SPACs have been torching people recently with a lot of dogshit blowing peoples' accounts up.  Rinse and repeat of the SPAC craze and implosion of the 00s.

He’s just mad cuz he can’t afford FD’s
Goodluck mate. I got out at 420 with a decent profit. I got scared when it dropped hard to the 408s. Can't let it slip like that again. Too volatile.
Anyone buying Baba calls?
Yes
I listened, thanks!! <3
Market drops.  NIO raises.  Makes sense.
I honestly don’t mind being limited by PDT on robinhood. Whenever I have the chance to trade I lose money. Whenever I’m forced to hold I make money. Trading is just fun but it’s not worth it if you can just hold and watch money slowly trickle in.
Favourite meme on wsb and there’s been great ones.

Yes

BABA bear time finally over?
Just bought 20 shares of TSLA. Let’s see how this plays out.
i had spy 355/356 put credit spreads and I wanna roll out but spy is gon kill itself till 350 ik it
TSLA is a scam. It sucks all the money from the rest of the market. When TSLA goes up you know market is dumping
I just earned 800$ in a hour, paperhands selling XD
Sureee
Dude im so scared fuck had to choose between rent for the next 2 months or PLTR
Some of y’all will get eaten alive when Palantir drops to $16 EOW.

Buy APHA dip!
Sorry I don’t invest in mergers lmao
TSLA 1000c 11/20
PS on the options side, I sold my TSLA call this morning at 498 and am jealous of those who had the balls to hold
ZM!!!!!
When you already came but she just keeps SUCKING. CRSR I can’t take it anymoree
Cashed out of NIO, cash gang until tomorrow
Definitely, it’s been added to my list!  Thanks for the DD!
So, how much % of your portfolio is in your December puts?
Let me know, I'm sitting on 20k cash also.
What do you mean? I looked up the real prices in march in Thinkorswim. 

Today they are worth this much, including all the time and volatility etc, thats the price for these options.
nio 50c exp 1/2021
That’s a little bit of my reasoning but there are many other factors.
TSLA ready for liftoff
bro, CIIC is not shit lol do ur dd before u spit
Just need the media to start hyping the coins again
Baba call
What does diamond hands mean? Not selling?
If the valuation is $5.2B why is CIIC market cap less than $1B on RH?
Oy vey look at that drill
This shit is crazy!
You show me a positive All Time graph I quit my job right now and work for you
If the TSLA RSI dips sub 30 I'm going all in
Yeah bro it aint gonna stop
I know we don’t talk shares here, but if we were, what would you grab right now for a long term hold - PLTR, CRSR, or PLUG?
Went with ciic
Guilty as charged.
tesla... whatre you doing....
Tesla FD
Sneaky volume on CLSK
And you fuckers laughed at me when I said I was buying SPY puts at 362
Out of WDAY for now, will probably moon, maybe reload on a dip
wmt just gonna fade all day again pissin me off
the one you push w your legs, maybe
History always rhymes & even us ret@rds know that market dips give way to crazy fucking rallies. All of us morons that doubled down in March made our yearly salaries in 4 months. No asshole that’s not in retirement using their 401k to buy Viagra for their wrinkly cock wants to be the pea brain that sells at the bottom & then has to chase the market. I don’t wanna be that guy but this time it’s different. More & more Autists realize that stocks go up in the long run. It’s like the biggest degenerate pyramid scheme of all time, so big that you’re a dickhead if you sit on the sidelines. The fed will be buying ETFs in 10 years or less mark my words ret@rds!
the CRSR fomo is real. Tb to when i had 200 shares at 20
will my tsla puts going to devastate my portofolio?
How is this DD?
Wish I would have bought more of those instead of CCL puts 🐻🌈
yea wtf is good with that

Even with zero logic PFE should go up. GME went up on news of using Microsoft Teams and selling out a brand new console like every other retailer. I’m fine with stupid shit like TSLA continuously going up but this is just mega retarded to me.
YES! and loving it. Only small potato money in it but im up 240$. Mine expire next Feb so Im wondering when to drop out. Once the Vaccine first batch news comes out they will soar.
Ackman would be jelly
why is the lil yachty indicator so damn accurate

Nice!  Right..
VIX creeping up. About to slaughter us shortly?
i really hate how anything can be pinned to the frontpage here. it's abuse of mods and clearly a pump and dump. stay away from any shill that's pinned. its a pure P&D
plz say it is so!
well, do you know how options work? if you bought a long dated spy put at 9:55 and sold at 10:25 you would have made money. obviously less the more long dated.

Timing a put on the SPY is much harder than ZM or DOCU imo. You need to worry about how stable SPY really is. when you buy a put, thats it, but when a hedge fund do so, they are constantly delta hedging ...
Can you sell some puts to manage your short term tax liability? I would definetly seek advice about taking into account past losses or spreading it across years...
Bro its nuts. I sold my calls yesterday confident that it was faltering and wouldn't get past the mid 15s. I even checked this morning and saw it go up and then down and was confident it was going to go sideways or bleed today. Then this shit happens. 

I would have been up 2k if I had held. Fuck me.
NIO
Nok is next on the list

Scalpings never been so fun
I love pltr long term but tbh when he does offload his shares people are def gonna panic here.
Of fucking course, back when I worked in the largest bank of my country investment managers were just guys smoking weed, doing coke and gaming dudes. No reason this has changed.
Gains are gains

Congrats and fuck off. Now take out 75% of those gains and re-invest the rest. Or yolo it all, I'm not your dad.

CIIC for sure
Where's the "PLTR is at bargain prices, buy in!" posts?  oh wait i just said it.  Buy in!  Buy in!
I’m long on alibaba. This dip is a good opportunity
That’s why I chose this username. The possibilities are endless

As they said in the Corps “complacency kills”, this has dragged on for months and people are becoming complacent (myself included). Now going out with groups of people, house parties.. etc. Example, a person gets tested two days after potential exposure, gets negative test and then chills with people. Well the incubation period is longer than two days, that person who thought they were neg, now infects others, then it multiplies.
Thanks, anon.
Sold my SPY puts so SPY could tank.  You're welcome.
You had a feeling deep down in your plumbs
$800 to invest. What can I buy that’ll make me a few hundred?
dude that was the nastiest bulltrap on the indexes

they must've gotten tens of millions of dummies to buy in
We might be the same person

I bought 1000 shares of PLTR on IPO day, bag held for like 2 weeks and sold at exactly $10.5

I think I made $50 🤦‍♂️

Got some 420s when it was 410!!!
This pleases my confirmation bias
No, it’s like 40%. That’s no where close to double.
It was a little disappointing but I was still happy.

Yall sleeping on DKNG. Called it yesterday. Next moon mission inbound
At least until you buy.
Ok gay bears just give up and let tsla run up
Yeah but such a risky play. By the numbers it shouldn't be going down so your short position would be entirely sentiment based. 

Which is great if you can time it but without an objective measure it's not a repeatable strategy.
TSLA got to do 530 today.
Someone bless me with a solid play please I am a struggling single father

you could’ve just said you were a gay bear
Will ciic crack 18 today.. idk how greedy to be
No shit, but that's the reason it's coming back up
Maybe selling puts is the way
What im trying to say is. If I’ve had unversed my self at open I would be up 35% instead -40%

Tesla is probably the safest bet
I think TSLA is going to pull back to 700 eoy. Yeah.
Why you do this NVDA? You increased your sales by 57%.. yet your still down
Why did Tesla taketh?
It's so weird what the hell you autists choose to pick for FOMOing.  A shit SPAC CIIC is now hot even though there's been a wave of SPACs getting blown up in recent months.

I used to be a logical person like you but then I realized if you do the opposite of logic you can make money
CRSR you dirty girl. Too bad I sold after open
So i found out from an insider that most hedge funds have this subreddit set as their homepage.
Wow so I see I can't even type out that fucking F word anymore?
Here comes a dip for TSLA take profits
Imagine selling pltr and missing out on telling soros to go fuck himself when it goes mooning
What should I get in on to hold over the weekend

Nah nah I’m saying it’s gonna break 17 and go up, misphrased it Mybad

It's not going to happen. You're right though, if it did, the govt would have to stop offering govt-backed loans in order for the tuition prices to drop afterwards. Like how it was in the 60s before the govt offered backed loans.

Why? Unless you're planning to retire soon. After every crash the market attains new highs within a few years. Hold positions in companies you believe in and broad etfs and when the market crashes pile your cash holdings into the same. I know my post here is r/investing shit but for the 99% this is absolutely true. I am building my cash holdings hoping for a crash while I still trickle money into stocks knowing I'm too retarded to time the market.

at the end of the day, day traders really don't know whats going on because they don't have every data point at hand. at best you can make  a picture and go with it, a lot of it is experience mang. Just realize which plays are losing, cut them, then manage your bankroll to risk. thats probably the biggest part of trading, is when you enter a play with confidence, realize the risk and manage it. im high af, my stocks are going as planned and im just waiting. but if im wrong, I dont care beacus the money i put in won't dent my overall profit, even if i lost it all.
PLTR about to go to the moon. BUY BUY BUY

I love how the market is going to pump the shit out of TSLA before inclusion so everyone holding SPY and VOO has to bag hold a bit of TSLA forever. Fucking pyramid scheme
Will CRSR hit 40? OMG
25k is margin only reason I’m in shares I’m full committed lol
I got on NIO early at 25 and profited, thought 25 was too much for CRSR and I'm regretting it heavily
But then you might miss out when it hits 600 EOW
WHO FUCKING SAID SUB 500? FUCK YOU!
who the fuck is selling on tsla lol
this is a great post. #2 should worry everyone however, im sure Elon will have no problem sticking it to the S&P for not including it the first time around
69420 shares baught. this will make you rich
I bought them yesterday around closing.  11/20 40C .  Honestly have no idea what’s going to happen from here on out.  I thought it would hit 38 on Friday not today
The amount of money needed to breakthrough 500 is the same need to go to 520. Today is gonna be lit for TSLA

**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

One of main requirements to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 20 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy it can't go down by design.

Lol a slight pull back after a huge run is not crashing.

What's the point of something even being on Robinhood if you can't buy options on it?
Way way up
If DKNG actually hits 60 next week I will be swimming in my own nut for days
Never sell
u goochie
Damn dude. You must be losing money
Leettzz go boiizz
Where’s butt PLUG hang at?? 🚀🔥🚀
So lets say CRSR goes up 10%, my option only goes up about 15% or so. If the delta is 1 and CRSR goes up 10%, the option will also go up 10%.
I feel like FCEL is being pumped... thinking about Dec Puts on FCEL
I dumped 10,000 into 12/31 AMD 83C...

CHANCE ME
HCAC could be back on the cards soon and hasn’t moved yet. Get it before the hype. One bit of news away for a big up day.
I think there is a dump at some point for us in the near future, but not an insane dump.  There is an unprecedented amount of money flowing into the economy/market.  Inflation will come for goods and services, but I think the stock market is ahead of the game in that regards.  Stocks are experiencing inflation first
yeah my today chart is fine but 1 week and 1 month are way off idk what the deal is
Pass
Fuck off with your pump and dumps
Where would be a good place to pick up plays like this early?

Fucking boomers are keeping it afloat dreaming of going on cruises as soon as they get a vax shot

Lol

not only that but 95% of us will make more money than you. The best saying is "bears do all the work but make the least amount of money" the market is essentially bullish till proven bearish.

NOthing wrong about taking profits. Take some off the table and leave the rest.

NIO IS CRASHING NOOOO
[removed]
Someone conducted a survey on that awhile back (2.4k people responded, I believe) the average age was 24-25.
Guys I did it! I finally fucking did it! 

I bought one share of NIO.
[removed]
Yeah if you’ve got that kind of capital you can play those swings and make good %s
What? I’m confused. If the delta is .9 how do you mean you’re barely making anything? You’re so far ITM that every time it moves your premium goes up a dollar? That’s a lot...
All hype atm, their small flat beds cost 22k. Even with the merger of club car, its not going to keep them afloat

Alright TSLA.  Where are you going now?  Make a move.
anyone else's rh graph fucked up..
You say that like the stock hasn't doubled in two weeks.

I can tell this reasoning is flawed, but can't explain why - Thus I agree with you.
Deutsche Bank has target at $50, Bank of America has target at $54.70, but I’m sure you’re much smarter than the analysts that work there, and have done much deeper research in to NIO financials than they have. I’m selling now based on your analysis.
DKNG breaking $50 soon!
guess real estate stocks are not booming as the market because people is too busy selling their 2nd residence and houses to cover their loses during COVID

so sales above forecast do not equal good stonks.
Here comes DOCU oh what a surprise. I can make millions on that one alone if I wasn’t such a p
Is TSLA gonna break 510 today? Should I sell my 11/26 calls for a massive gain?

Your faith in papa Elon wavered, heretic.
I probably gotta sell it. Even a slight dip tomorrow would really crush my profits. It could easily run another 5% tomorrow, but I don't want the risk
I'm FOMOing hard into TSLA and NIO rn

I'll be selling my car to get back into puts if mine expire. I'm ready to put everything on the line. Tesla is flying too close to the sun.
Hold on to 11/27 $505c or sell?
I start getting really nervous every time NIO shoots up now
get in on LRN while you can
CRSR calls are lovely

Yea. I just bought those calls for a quick flip on the oversold region when it was fading hard after S&P news. I didn’t expect it to fade and then skyrocket like that. Holy shit. I also don’t want to hold and gamble for too long because I am down 3500 overall and don’t to lose even more because I slowly gain it back. If I was playing with house money I would’ve just held.
Today bois...we moon
Do we buy TSLA calls for the FOMO of other r buy puts knowing there will be a flip AHHHHH

1% is a lot though when it comes to long term holding. I know it gets lost in the volatility, but a few 1% mistakes adds up to a big deal.

PLTR is so pretty on the chart. Pump then chill to the right, then pump again. We are chilling to the right rn btw
Sell you fool
Take profit if that close brother. A red day tomorrow and you have no option to wait for a recovery. Better to take it while ahead even if you miss out on a few dollars tomorrow.
520 for sure today
The flaw in this reasoning is you are treating the entire market as a game to the rich to use to punish. The reality is they don't give a shit about trump they care about being and staying rich. Maybe there is some cabal of coordination but I don't think the rich change the game based on politics.

sold at $23 and man do i feel like shit
Word is 88% of the consoles they sold were the disc based version. Your story sounds like bullshit, there's no way they were filling $400 orders with a $500 product that is sold out everywhere.
China EV bull flag was pretty easy to call.
Nio to 50 confirmed
Not dump but I’ll be surprised if it bumps far above 50
If you're young, ***ask yourself one thing***:

Would you be more angry if you (1) lost your savings, or (2) missed out on being an overnight millionaire because you were too pussy to hit the BUY button on that sweet sweet weekly call.

[deleted]
It's gonna break past 50 then end on 48-49
That's why you sell before the options before the earnings so you don't get crushed. Yeah keeping them can make you a shitload of tendies, but it can also erase your account. Greasy fingers loose the tendies.
Confirmed
Tesla looks like she's losing steam
People losing their minds cause Tesla up 3.5%
Apple making a nice little flag
No because those shares have a set strike price so the person selling the call would sell it to the buyer at that rate.

You also need the capital to excerise so only big players excerise.

Most people are just chicken sitting on the option keeping it warm and assuming the risk and then selling before hatch to someone better equipped to handle the live chick (shares)

Most of the run up happens before hand if sellers see movement and try to cover prior to assignment.
The study was conducted in April, with a lower volume of cases... with self reported results.

RIP Tesla.
TSLA has been a daytrader’s wet dream this week
What’s next 510 then 520?

Id like to see 17.90ish. It would be a nice point to reload
make your own decisions
Get out today don’t hold theta will eat you
> because nobody who trades know what they're doing.

Serious question: Does that ever change and you become a wizard, or does really nobody has any idea past educated/informed guess and risk management?

I keep piling on the books I read and making slim earning from prudent swing trading but I wonder if i'll ever get a hold of it or if it will forever be careful gambling more than calculated risk (dunno if the difference is as obvious to others as it is to me).
ZM. Keep trying baby you piece of shit

So when does the PLTR pump start?
Depends on your exp date and if you think it’s overvalued currently.  Personally I think the company will continue to grow as they get more stores but they could take a hit in the short term.  If you have a short-dated put it might be best to sell and recover what you can
Oh mooning = $6/12pct below where it was less than one week ago! what a moon!!

With TSLA the only way is to treat it as a bet and diamond hand it to expiry basically.  


It either hits big or you lose your bet, treating them like options is really hard since it swings so wildly
I should have gone NIO over ZM but hey I guess tesla will just carry for now

Do I sell my calls if NIO makes me break even for my all time, or do I hold for gainz?
So if Ackman takes Stripe public does that mean PSTH moon?

Threw $80 at an FD this morning. I'll be fine, just wanted something to wake me up.
Isnt this incorrect as the contracts you would have bought then would have high ass premiums with the VIX spike? They would not be worth this much
I’m waiting for 40$ then I will start sweating
the best thing is that CRSR isnt even overvalued, sitting at 3.8bn mcap with over 1.5bn revenue and actual net income

I sold my 02/21 20c yesterday for ~400%. The delta on it was 0.9 so was barely making anything. Currently holding 12/2021 35c up ~100% which I should be rolling over soon cuz the delta on that is 0.7.
Tesla Model S no longer 'recommended' by Consumer Reports due to reliability concerns- CNBC
not really when you have a million dollars. It's 1% ...

First of all this is hilarious. 

Second of all, did I see the made up word "upmost" in here? What is it with people going through life without having the slightest fucking clue about what's going on? How fucking brain dead do you have to be to think the word 'upmost' exists? In between molesting you, your relatives never bought you a book or let you read a newspaper they bought? Any credibility you ever have in life will be immediately wiped out by how retarded you make yourselves appear in writing. I can't imagine what your resumes look like, holy shit.

**How much $15,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 11/20/20 $300** strike calls was **1.51**. Lets say we used $15k to buy 100 contracts to hold until expiration.

Today SPY 11/20 $300 calls are at the price of 55.70 which gives us a total value of:

#$557,000

no TA, no DD, no need to monitor Elon twitter, just blindly invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement. All you need is luck and perfect timing. 🌈🚀
Cause chase is selling you their options. They got the insider trading options going
All I see is a big W shaped recovery like the analysts said in March
Analysts never wrong

Want to get more shares. 

NIO or PLTR?
Wasn't there a guy who bought like 50K worth of TSLA puts
F150?
Is there a reason CRSR IV is so high?
Nio you fucking monster!

It's a boomer stock, but my favourite boomer stock. I have some shares.
CRSR isn't even a tech company. they sell peripherals and some PC components, and have a lot of competition. is there even a moat?

for what reason is it up 8% today? more lockdowns mean people are going to buy computers.. the same computers they would have bought 8 months ago for the first lockdown?
$10k after $10k adds up pretty fast.
While y’all on Tesla. Nio about to break 48

I sold my shares yesterday, don't regret a thing
I dunno.  Fighting retard strength is tough.
Yo when should i sell my option my shit is going up and i scared
Keep saying CRSR will have a red day, but at this point I don’t think it’s going to happen
I've bought every top and sold every bottom. EVERY...SINGLE... ONE 🤡
i’m waiting for a dip but all i see are big green dildos
she goes when she wants to go
da fuq?! No respek for TSLA 🐻. No fucking way. They did it to themselves bc they want to be ass-gaped. Fuck Mark Spiegel and his ilk.
[removed]
A win is a win
Teslas are literally everywhere where I live
Idk man seems kinda gay
Im riding SOLO
Paper hands activated
How can you when it's up another 25% today?!
PLTR green dildos soon.
Up 5k in two days thanks to ekons cock rocket
Well I had and PLTR...

but also NI0 👌
I bought shares at 124$ like a boomer fuck a couple months ago and just want to exit the position to free up buying power
I bought SOLO and FCEL puts and now I’m sweating
Cummins announced they are going to hydrogen and ditching diesel. Thats the reason for the run up. 

It's not being talked about because no one in WSB does DD anymore.
also why there so many variations, theres CIIUC, CIICW and CIICU do yk if they're all linked? they seem to be, might get in CIICW its cheap
You’re a retard then. Should have held till 200 next year. I’ll see you then to rub it in because I already know 100% where this company is going
So glad I got out of PLTR and got back to NIO, got destroyed by PLTR IV in the last 3 days
Damn I missed the Tesla 500 break by 5 minutes
" This thing is a juggernaut going back to its ipo level of $50 "

This is the retard confidence I love to read!
Bought 100 Ciic shares at the top, currently up bigly, +3$ 😎😎😎

So yeah guys, if you need some investing advice, talk to me and we can make bank together 🥳
Huge F in the chat

Oh NET you gave me such hope with that nice run this morning :(
Lol so 525 today?
Corsair go brrrrrr
sounds good man
Lol what?
“Where were you when TSLA hit 500?”
I can’t stop buying the tech dip
Wish I would’ve just been shorting baba this whole time...would’ve made a killing
Still man. I’m selling at $21 and it’s gonna get there easy. Don’t go full retard
how am i supposed to not paper hands this tesla call jfc
PLTR wtf why are you going the wrong way
SOLO up 25% and still going
With the fed rates at zero for the next couple years they have a lot of room to grow
master roku is bending air like a motherfucker
I was looking at $15.80 on my screen for 20 minutes thinking I should buy pre-market. I’d be up 10% rn instead of down 1%. Guess it won’t matter in the long run though
fuck you PLTR do something
when does the SPY mega drill team kick in
Positions? Calls, leaps? Stocks ?
what are you talking about. FV is market price
thanks for your prayers, ill be back after I sell my car
Good job man I did the same
If one day I become a tech bear, is it better to buy SQQQ calls or QQQ puts?
I might watch that movie tonight while planning my DRKN FD
CRSR just casually up 23% in 2 days
Caught an 8 bagger with SONO. Only threw like 700 in there because it was an earnings play though. Fml

How the fuck does GRWG keep soaring like this
[deleted]
If you didn’t buy TSLA leaps on 9/8 or 10/30, you’re literally retarded
This is how its supposed to work. 

Too strong to crash for puts but too smart to reward retarded FOMO plays of those that decided to yolo on weekly calls waiting another 20% after a 20% run up. These behaviours shouldnt be rewarded.
Name your $. As an AZ guy, this shit always is the biggest 50/50 gamble ever
200 shares of TSLA. Papa Elon I'll ride with you till we land on Mars 😩
Do something zoom you coward!

Good morning solo

he got shares, he's only down 10k lol
[deleted]
I see it hitting 30 by the end of Dec
I just fomoed in. Probably at the top. No regerts
I’m trying so hard not to fomo and lose money again
Because he can afford to not give a shit what people like you think about his looks
If it's just 20% we'd be mostly OK. Just average out your loss by buying more.

Bought alibaba at 270, and i keep buying till my Avg Price per Unit is 254. And if it tanks further i will buy further... Now if it were to tank 50% from my current position i couldnt double the amount i put in to average that though.
I feel personally attacked on this haha
It will be dumping EOD

Low volume today, but rises 10%? Damn
Solo though O.o
Is this going to make me rich?
What with that boeing straight dick up earlier lol
When you make hundreds of 2 575 Tesla FDs you know it’s gonna be a good day...
In @ 27.95
PLTR might be flat for the indefinite future. Maybe time to cash out... hmm
Fucking same...

Bought shares at $14.5 and when options came out I said I would wait for a pullback. I am up like 150% on fucking shares....

Never pulled back.... now it is absolutely fucking RIPPING.
2 weeks is probably too early unless you're an ultra 🌈🐻
was trying to find a spot to get into CRSR. just ended up hoppin in cuz yea.
Now I can use some of Tesla profit on nio again 😈
😂😂 he’s back again the kid that bought puts. Sorry little moron this thing will keep rocketing 

My 10c doing fantastic
Ah. Head and shoulder.
S&P500 inclusion baybee

NIO is 10% of my portfolio and 80% of my gains right now. This Chinese EV shit better keep going up because I suck at this.
Huge opportunity for maxr calls

You weren't with me and most others, you bought wayyyyyy sooner

There are a lot of people sitting on some extra cash just now hearing the market is going up (omg ATH!), new shitcoin highs etc.

And since houses are too expensive for an investment right now and interest is 0 they invest in the US market.

I am Dutch, lot of ppl started lately. And nobody really gives a fek about the AEX. Look at the slower increase of EU markets. I think this is one huge factor for the "pump", there just is a lot more money available for the US market.

&#x200B;

And I agree with most of your data, and will try to hedge as I see fit, but that is only US, US and US. The market isn't.

Too much text. Give me some positions bro

TESLA MELT UP FUCKERS!!!!
The salaried performers have quotas.  They are essentially gifting their money back and forth to meet their quotas.  

Example:

I gift you $5.  Your total earnings are $5.

You gift me $5.  My total earnings are $5. Your total earnings are still $5.

I gift you another $5.  Your total earnings are now $10.  

See the problem?
I can’t believe people still buy NKLA... like wtf
Snow I’m cumming
Nio fucking racing up to keep pace with tesla gains

REITS are usually leased properties. These are purchases so home builders, hardware box stores, I don’t know much about major realtor co like caldwell banker and if they are listed?

Wtf do you know about bull traps. Your moms a trap
Likey will get another dip on crsr to push us up another 4% and we fade back down to this level again. 40 by tomorrow
wow username checks out
The same reason it went absolute nuts yesterday: literally no reason.
I need to CRSR dip to get in. FCK!!
I think ptlr gonna be stagnant around the $18 mark for a few months.
Today is one of those days MMs specifically designed to punish dip buyers
Fuck what s happening with PLTR. I thought with the contract news it should be over 20 by now😡
stocks go up

No options, the only way to buy puts is sell your shares
Uh Tesla baby
No no one here likes FCEL
I feel this one deep in my soul, I had 1k shares at like 14 and was feeling pretty good about selling at 26
Probably 520 today

Bull traps everywhere
My 12/18 700c would appreciate that
I should clarify, the delta value is the value of your contract per dollar of underlying. So $1 of stock move = .xx on the contract. So if delta is .5 and theta is 1.0 you need $2 positive move to not open red 

Somebody can probably explain it better than I but that’s the gist

Dude LMAO, within minutes of me selling these stock rocketed up, crashed down, trading was frozen, then news dropped and they went +$4 after hours. Bid on these option is 0 this morning. Thanks for the free tendies, wish i had more to yolo, but 10% return in 1 day is dope.
This is the way
Love when TSLA becomes the meme stock again, feels like home.
Facts in two weeks mf are going to be like “i wish i held my 12/4 $20 calls pltr is at $25 now fml”

I’ll be buying every dip. Wonder when the next will be. Probably once people catch on to this company, inflate it, and it drops a bit from sell offs.

Sweet gains enjoy that !

Got them full game at first half and contemplating the over but I think the weather will be dog shit.
I sold when it hit 18
Something's fishy about this whole Soros announcement, along the lines of all the negative press that came out following the direct listing. Like the IBs and hedge funds were all bitter that they got left out of the usual IPO process that would have allowed them to establish their positions before the stock popped ( like they did with SNOW).

If Soros was gonna sell, why would he announce it, knowing that the negative publicity would, if anything, depress the stock price?

Seems more likely that he's loading up on shares and made this announcement to keep the price lower while he and the rest of the big money investors steadily add PLTR to their funds before the public catches on to the fact that this company is on its way to a $100B+ valuation over the next few years.

My 2 TSLA 480c 11/20 that I bought for 2.00 and sold for 2.11 are now worth 27.00 each. I fucking hate myself. This is the second time.

when will tsla split again?

Buy calls at open any of past 3 days.  Or buy calls literally any time yesterday or day before and you are up big.  Wtf are you even doing?
Come on, PLTR. Need you at least to hit $19 today, bb

Upvote for the typo
CRSR just free money
Bought long dated close to the money so as long as it’s green I am content.

Way more people here trying to help you than give you poor advice
Bad idea crsr won’t go as high as NIO
TSLA gonna carry the whole market
The people posting gains in here are not the same people posting DD lol. Except that PRPL mattress guy, he is the exception.
You need the 25k+ at the previous day's close, and margin doesn't count towards

I'm probably not explaining it very well.

I logged in this morning hoping to buy CIIC at its share price (around $17 at the moment) but found that with my Chase brokerage account, I could buy CIICU (units) but only at $19+ each. 

With all the hype on this one now, this stock is getting away from me, but I'm curious as to why the disparity between the actual price and what chase wants me to pay for it. Is there more in a unit than just a share?
Up enough on the year right to cash out pay taxes and buy a model 3. God damn this is tempting
SPY is not green
Interesting. Thanks

Holy shit TSLA

I was holding GE paper for four years watching it sinking under 15, under 10, under 8 ... and I sold and boom new slick CEO and pumped by every shitdollarwhale to see it rise to 9 something.

They might have a future in supplying energy parts.  But their credit branch that smoothed away the cracks in their infrastructure is gone.  And there will be much less in the way of avionics in our future.

So who knows.  You could be right.  But they still cast a shadow.

I didn’t hold a significant portion of my gains for over a year, so I’ll pay short term capital gains tax instead of long term. 33% vs 15% in taxes.

Thanks for replying and re-explaining.  I just looked at the pretty pictures because I can't read.  Nice effort on the DD by the way.
I told myself, if my TSLA option order doesnt fill in 15 seconds its just not meant to be. Never filled. GG
Why is crsr going up? They didn't even announce anything new. This has to be a pump/dump.
Ahh good point
Small dip just happened
If you didn’t load up on spy puts on this pump..you hate money
**TSLA 50000000000000000000**
yassss!!!!
next stop 600
It’s not going. Down
LETS GOOOOO
Woooo! I had faith
na family ciic is merging  so that price bout to hit 20 coz mergers always good sign. Everyone bullish on mergers. Also they have back orders for I think usps for a new fleet. I got shares so I might even send my local council a link for them to buy some since we a liberal city. U know since im part owner might as well help the company 😅😅😅
palantir is doing the market drop

So glad I bought PLTR and CIiC. 🙄

#500
TSLA needs to get over $500 to 🚀!!
Paypal WTF
They don't even their own factory 

some other retard shops all over the place make them cars

lmfao
Thats why the rule is "Positions or ban".  If you're going to talk shit on a stock, at least back it up with something.

This is just some asshole losing other people's money.
Protect ya neck!
Look up KCAC to see what will happen to CIIC tmrw.
I would guess most people sell them.

Thank you for this insightful and informative post mate
Not pictured: the dozens of people that flipped a coin and didn’t get heads five times in a row.
I tried and got burned. I just need to figure out where the bounce is.

Glad I bought when it dipped below 17
CIIC pump n dump or legit??
Yeah I’m in Jan 1/15 C
Everything is green except my account fml
TSLA wants to do its thing rn. Can’t seem to find the juice to get it going
TSLA less than half of the average daily volume so far, and up over 2%

with Buffet building a position, s&p news, and EV dominating the market....

we taking off today boys
fuck I got in at yesterday's top, waiting for the great wall of 500 to fall (hope) to make some $$$. Good job on your success! I wish you much more!
anyone here have an AWS certification? I kinda wanna complete one for personal development

Wish my ACH transfer had settled been missing out big these past two trading days
The classified work for the US govt has to be CIA surveillance
I hope they're not dishonest. Because I'm naked long investing in the renewable energy stocks! 

I feel that all renewable energy stocks, even ETFs like TAN, are more than 20% bumped up in value by hope and high expectations, so there's a lot of bias and ideals built into these stocks values, IMO.

I'm 5'9 and 152lbs I dont think I can afford to get skinnier lol.
Still got some room for more air.
Gonna still NIO so hard into the ground now for punishment for scaring me
bruh where do I get one
We all know there will be a green day of reckoning for BABA after 2 weeks of red / flat... Its going to be huge and those who catch it will make good money... but the question is... WHEN
Yes, sell them to me
Not just a theta play. You can scalp with it too. Buy a 360 or 359 put on SPY yesterday around 1:00 eastern for example would have had a huge gain in a few hours. But they can also go straight to zero just as fast. Keep bets small if you’re going to play a 0 DTE.
See you on the yacht in the bahamas fam!

BABA 2022 leaps?
Buying CIIC dip
Word.  I will say multiple leaders have voiced that they sac'd their own positions on multiple trades so that team members could get out ahead of them and profit (they make it up in volume).  And that they work around 50-60 hours a week just on the basic benefits (alerts, zoom lessons).  Throw in another 10+ hours on the mentoring and eek, that's too much work for me but I'm glad they don't agree lol.  Its just a lot different than any other group/paid service I've come across.
Yes
Rooney!? Eeewwwwwwwwwwwwww

Thats what people said about NIO too /shrug
Great now I just need it to go to 300

Should I sell?
NIO price target is 60 boys might want to learn to read and do your DD if you wanna make money. NIO to the moon, congratz to all the non retards who got in on this gold mine early let’s ride to 200 next year
That was a valiant effort baba. I know that was difficult for you.
CBAT, Corsair, PLTR, GME?, and then for the pennies - NAKd
DKNG hovering 50 needs to crush so I can coom
Because I made a grip on it.
Because they think it is TSLA, but Chinese and less expensive.
That's what I thought last quarter too
the fuck just happened to ciic
????? I just bought a nio call and rh took the money but no pending order?????
Looking like $200 to my uneducated autist brain. Don't trust chinese stocks anymore, just not worth it.

You seem like you won't yell at me for the noob question: how does selling and buying it back affect taxes, if the ultimate profit you made was the same at the time of taxes?
Fucking useless shitty oil leaps.  
Fuck fuck shitty fuck cunt.  


At least Nio and PLTR are doing well.
Suprisingly it's holding strong around its new high. Wonder how long this lasts though. Wonder if people will be profit taking now or expect it to go even further soon.
Sorry, I jinxed it.
Low key had hearth attack when bought CIIC and saw CIIG. Like holy shot fat fingered the ticker.
Are we selling nio calls now or holding ?
lol bottom is not in yet
NIO yes
wish i had gone deeper into COTY, bought some $7 1/15c this morning didn’t think it’d be past 6 for another day or so
LI to $41 NIO to $52 GME to $14 please and thanks.
I don’t think these guys understand how streaming works. Just because half the donations are from streamers to themselves doesn’t mean the service doesn’t still take a cut. If a retard wants to pump his numbers and waste his money like that it’s only good for the company lol
If every retard on this sub give this retard a dollar he’d have more than enough to buy himself 100 dream cars

I didn't even know what the company was or did and bought just cause black rock was involved


I'll look into more and may buy back on a dip
PLTR is gonna be a $100 stock in 5 years
CRSR the new meme stock?

Godspeed retard
Nothing but I’ve noticed tickers generally reverse whatever trend they showed from 9:30-10:30.
01/15/21 feels too close now so looking at the 04/21s and 01/22s.
Oh I see that you’re long pton. I thought you wanted pton below 100 cuz you had puts or something. I had some shares myself that I held from 45ish to around 110. Sold before the last earnings. I don’t know if you read the last earnings report but they’ve kind of fucked themselves with manufacturing. They’re at manufacturing capacity and they said they’re expecting the delays to continue well into next year. That means growth is gonna slow down for next couple quarters. Their gross margin is also down and they said they expect it to stay down because they’re using more expedited shipping methods to try to make up for manufacturing delays. Imo it’s time to find a new play. Congrats on 400k though that’s wild!
PLTR forming the Wu-Tang formation meaning its about to pop high af

Recommend options, own shares, still no pictures...

You're whats wrong with this sub.
You're a gay autist
I love how everyone is congratulating OP this morning when they had already sold yesterday. This is such a hilariously failed pump and dump over to peloton.
DKNG: 50 is like TSLA: 500

fucking LAVA
Read the last paragraph and check my last trade.
Anybody try to take a good DKNG this morning?

Ohh thank you! So should I just take the loss right now or hold it till tomorrow? Since it beat earnings and is now on the rise
If CIIC hits $16.50 I’m buying back in
I would honestly love to know about the average age of all the retards here.
yep, we are all autists but we are not friends. trust nobody and make decisions on your own.
They use something called a “computer” I think.
It does every few days, this ain‘t it.
NIO no:(
COME ON TSLA LETS GOOOOO
[deleted]
So load up on puts. Why are you swing trading $10k on a market index when you have such high conviction about a market move in the near future? Like if you’re willing to take a loss on say, $2k, just buy $2k of SPY puts. DD has no conviction.
Whenever i touch tesla i lose money
There are those cases of course. It’s the motto here after all. Buy high sell low
Tldr; OP loves the cock
So January puts it is. Thank you for your info elder.

If you’re not day trading TSLA 11/20s you’re not living. Easiest money I’ve had in a while flipping calls
Only but at ATH.
Got a long way to go to make up 2g in share losses lol
Finally closed a weekly put on T! I was sweating it but we made it
I'ma buy a lot and build like six houses on it
And fuck CBAT dipping
[deleted]
It's kind of disgusting how PFE just keeps going down even though they have a vaccine...SMH
So do you set up stop losses or sell limits? How do you make sure you don’t get ultimately boned? How do you know when to sell?
There are way too many $20 short term calls over the next few weeks that the big boys won’t allow it to get to that point for a while. I expect it to pop in ~month
Nice. I love percents too
You said it
the autist that called bottom on BABA is my hero.

My senior dev would say many things are possible. I say you gotta shot.

We are returning ti the promised lands brother, it has been foretold
its up 50 cents what are you even saying
Took profits on my Jan 21’s, hands too papery
300 bucks profit, folks!!! ATV it is :)
I'm shaking my big juicy ass
As if the degens here could get their brokers to give them permission to trade after-hours.
SOLO going strong
I only read the last 2 lines. Was this satire?
If XPEV could go ahead and blast to 50 that would be great.

And now you're out of sight, yeah  
Show me how want it to be  
Tell me, BABA, 'cause I need to know now, oh because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)  
I must confess I still believe (still believe)  
When I'm not with you I lose my mind

Wait for CIIC dip or buy now??
Autism has evolved into something else here.
Can you explain what that means? I am retarded

Yeah my nio calls are saving my corpse
Index funds will buy within a few days, ends on Dec 21. Others spread out.

I think there maybe mechanisms to prevent the stock jump on Dec 21. It's not risk free profit.

Also some funds that benchmark S&P500 may have bought TSLA already.

TSLA is a great company from long term view. This helps me to hold tight.
Hitting $25 next week though.
lmfao felt this
It's a sloppy top Y
wait til expiry or sell eod?
Early sells can be good for unloading bags on other members of this sub, but otherwise I agree

Fuck off miracle whip paste creamery this is retard central
Honestly I post this out of complete DD not to lead anyone astray but if you haven’t gotten into NIO yet I highly suggest it because this stock is legit here for the long term. It’s going to end up being multiple hundreds worth
Babs green!
🤡
no, never too early for the miracle herb
I gotcha

I feel like almost all the states are in "this is fine" territory now
Wtf NIO
Definitely not
SOLO calls.
By friday
But they will go back up coz his economic policy helps us more than bidens policies. If I hit that 400k and pass it im gonna get fondled by the IRS and get boohoo taxes
At least 100k come April because I sold for a bit and bought back like an idiot.

All my shit might be saved even the ones I gave up on.

Crsr up nearly 7% still down on my option, that’s how stupid I am.
It had an IPO under absolutely perfect conditions for its industry which makes forward guidance tough to sell as being optimistic. They made a lot of money but where can they go from here?
I am with Chase, and as soon as I hopped on, they were selling CIICU and CIICW.

Units are selling for $2 more than the share price I can see elsewhere, how come?
You guys are all gay

In your 2nd chart; Buffet Indicator.  Why is your Historical Trend Line flat?  You are covering 3 decades (1990-2020).. The historical trend line for the market isn't 0%.

Not agreeing or disagreeing with your overall conclusions, just don't understand why a historical trend line for the market (over 3 decades) would be 0%.
Mango man will concede in the next 48 hours. Get ready for the pump.
Thank you for your post, your insight, and your humor. Disregard all the fucks criticizing you and such. 

These kinds of post harken back to the quality of WSB a few years ago, warms mah heart. 

With that said...WMT 1/21/23 $155c & maybe i’ll consider your puts, but a month of two further out. Feb or March again, Dec seems too soon. The politics of LIFE are about to kick in full strength as we approach christmas, people need hope, and govt seeks to maintain some semblance of order and status quo. “We will be okay, happy holidays; keep your head up” sorta thing. 

At least, that’s my opinion.

Please get to 50
What’s the play today ?
[deleted]
So yes.. buy some long calls
Why you gotta give me hope like that GME?
IV crush. The IV of the option was pricing in a larger movement in price than what actually happened after earnings this morning. Since it was a smaller move than expected, the price of your option decreased even though the underlying moves the correct direction

Attention fellow Autists. 'Tis time to pump the shit out of CIIC.

That us all :)
someone made a post earlier this week. probably rolls out at different time for people
Morning fellas, dont get broke
Seems like I was a week early on XPEV and NIO. Good luck retards who aren’t holding 11/20 calls
Come on CIIC you slut give me an entry
Everything inside spy is dumping. But spy keeps pumping. Wtf
that’s all i’m asking for

DraftKings when it gets to 50: 👉👈
Buffet indicator is a terrible metric to time a crash. Could be today, could be in 5 years... do you want to potentially miss the next 5 years of irrational growth? 

Most money is made right before the bubble pops...

Also, some index doesn't represent the economy... the only thing truly suffering in this economy is tourism/hospitality commercial, real estate and aviation (for like another year), rest of the economy is doing just fine.

Imo big PE will crash (zoom e.g.), most of the reasonably priced companies will be fine with just a minor correction. I'd argue that we will see a March like recovery in Value tickers sometime next year, while growth naturally contracts.

I think you are a gay bear crash prophet and while you eventually be right, you will not be able to accurately time the big one.
Damn Pltr sucks ass. Should've put all my money in NIO like a responsible investor.
If it’s not at ATH it’s a buy for me dog
Just because of this I loaded up and am now at 46 call contracts! GODSPEED retard 🤟🏼
Is NBEV a buy?
BABA
It’s a $5k play for me. Most of that being shares.
The fuck? IV is sky high and will drop hard plus stonks don’t typically keep going up and up. And worst case scenario is he gets to keep premium AND sell his shares for an even higher price.
Are we hoping for something (500+) that they can control (great wall of 500)?
look at the theta vs. delta - the delta will be the # of dollars the underlying has to move to offset the theta, still a wild ass guess but will help inform your decision
NIO saving my ass while PLTR trying to fuck me
EOD if it keeps pumping like this. I think a lot jumping in now after earnings and IV is 'stabilised'.
Me. Have made good money recently
Rare green on baba
Shutup loser
so should i buy SKF, GLL, and ZSL?
Well you made me 50 bucks today so far, god bless

Yes but it just might work
im not in it but its only up 100% ytd, thats nothing in wsb terms
the longer you wait the better it will feel. save it till the evening
PLTR has dumped the last 3 days in the first hour. It's fine... probably.
Its probably day traders trying to scalp them profits.  As soon as it hits 499 they dip out. When it goes down they dip in.
top was yesterday
Nine hundred thousand shares? Are you paper trading?
Nobody wants to play with AAPL anymore. Its like in toy story when andy drops woody in the trash bin , “byeeee wooooody”

It’s been a wild thirty minutes lol
Hey to all the gay bears who stupidly believed NIO would rank and were talking shit yesterday, don’t you hate it that I’m right every single day about my stocks? Next time listen and just buy the fucking stock, hold it, and make bank bitch. NIO 70 to 80 by NIO day!!!
Did you mean without the minus?
Questionable.

These chats were from Bloomberg chat.  Obviously, because it was a investigation, they are privileged & destroyed post investigation.  The folks on WSB are wittier, for sure.
FUCK UNUSUAL WHALES
If I have a TSLA Friday expiring option, is it better to sell in the morning before it goes for $500? I worry that I will lose as much Theta as I gain in value?
actually though, you can at least find the retard discussion on the stock your trading. everyone here is trading the same thing lmfao

i can't believe these retards, it isnt bots either, who is buying CIIC.... retards. actual fucking people here are just following this retarded wave.

&#x200B;

fucking trade real stocks that hold supports like FIS, DG, and HD. lmfaooo made 2,000$ on FIS calls today, but its a "boomer" stock lmfao
Jesus the movement on tsla is making my charts look glitchy.

NIO 50 by December. its guaranteed

Also, more importantly if the source of uncertainty around the market or the particular underlying stock disappears, IV drops very quickly and your options value plummets even if you got the stock price move direction correct.

Because have you seen all the post in the two months trying to pump this stock? It was an obvious pump and dump. It’s the only reason it went up.
My inner retard is tingling someone hit me with a play.
about what time should we buy those
You never bet more than 10k, because you don't even have 10k.  Your bankroll is a rubber banded roll of fivers "earned" from blowing truckers behind the dumpster behind Wendy's next to the Love's truck stop, you incestuous lot lizard.
When we start seeing a bunch more posts about it.
This is a bull trap, I can smell it

Cmon give it to me. Just one more PLTR jump. Do it. Fucking do it.
PSA: **Stocktwits > WSB**
That's what they said last time.
hahaha i see. well, i can see florida in the "this is fine" situation so that's what i thought the joke was, lol.
I agree the market is overpriced, but don't see any reason why it will tank on any specific date. It may actually tank after we start rolling out vaccines and the economy isn't instantly fixed, because it will take a long time for everyone to get one and for our behavior patterns to return to hold.

Premise 3 and 4 have a lot of wrong information in them.
Reducing bond yields doesn't just lead to cheaper lending it also leads to less people putting money into bonds, because the rates are lower, so that money goes to stocks, Maserati purchases or whatever else. We only saw deflation in Mar/Apr, June/July had some of the highest inflation in the last 10 years.

Consumer demand in premise 5 is lower because more people are saving, not because QE isn't working.  There are just limits of what QE can do, but this would be worse without QE.

The biggest problem right now, is the economy needs more stimulus and nothing is going to come out of DC for a while.
Lmaoooooo
Woo! Let's go
My 47/48 spreads will thank you too hehehe good luck!
weve since converted to the creed of CIIC

Set up an excel spreadsheet last night for my sister and brother in law to track all their assets and liabilities and net worth. Turns out my lil sis has even me beat in net worth by about 20% despite household income being lower. I need to get them on this sub so I can pass them ASAP. Have them make some TSLA $700 calls 1/1/2021
Well then... I'm loving today any predictions for tomorrow?

So how much money do I put into TSLA?
Its like these kids don't understand that anything over 10% was considered a bonus the last 50 years...nowadays these entitled shits *expect* 200% gains as the defacto norm
I need this.
550
How much should I buy in TSLA right now? While it’s sitting at $496
What an educated guess on how much taxes you gotta pay on this?
The volume on it is gonna be crazy today I’m all in

Gme how? Like no volume

The tyson story actually impacted their stock. 😮
Seems like a smart idea!  Are you able to post proof of your swing trades and cash that you’ve made on the side somehow?  Looking to validate what you’ve said with evidence of your wealth that you’ve been accumulating.
Why is PLUG mooning
Damn should of just bought QQQ calls lmao fuck
Sell off spy 357p or wait for late dump?

Wow baba has a pulse
Where do we think Tesla is EOD
So what’s the deal with RH reporting a second story on how king Jew is selling all of his shares but they’re not writing anything about the contract they just won with the US military?
hahahahaha! Fuck you retard!
Renaissance is pulling up the average.  The median is far below WSB.
They are really pushing this over +$500
Debating buying into the latest thing wsb is shilling today. Pump and dump maybe, but to be fair, it often works to ride it up as long as you’re not the last one on.
DKNG 50!
TSLA moving like a real retard
Squeeze GME please
That wall at 500 lmao
priced in
Everything I've bought just gaps up wtf market is this. Except my poor BABA. Free Jack Ma
this is like the fifth time ive seen one of these memes on this sub. seriously the words might be slightly different, but its the same fucking meme over and over again, I bet tomorrow someones gonna post this with the words NIO/PLTR calls/puts and itll get to the front page for the day

Smart to get in TSLA here? Probably not. Yeah closed my weekly and looking for a reentry
May 35c if you can afford it :/
u missed out on a 20% run since ur comment
AYRO ON FIRE
I’m holding
He said he did
This guy fuks.
AND WE’RE GREEN BABY
Maybe not. I sold my puts and will buy them back when SPY goes back up
So close.. papa Elon has been teasing me all morning
Who said anything about TSLA
anyone know what’s up with GME? just went vertical
Im pretty sure youre supposed to inverse sentiment lol
when did they change?
After some bad losses trading I actually did the thing and took maybe 2-3 months off, focused on just smart spending, paying down some debt, and my actual gay job 

that being said...PLTR it is!
Fuck da bears we pumping
How long are y'all holding CIIC? I'm probably gonna hold overnight
That's a nice meme, does it come in Normie?
Literally just looked back it was down .7% then up .4% lol but question stands
Boeing dip 

Get some
Calls right now!
Oh for sure! I’ll keep holding at this stage. I’m in Canada so the fees to sell would only compound the Loss. 

It’ll be fine in the long term. Might even add on the dip.
amazon dip, shooting for 4k eoy
what's the move
DUMP THE FCKING CCL ALREADY
My 11/20 🤡 call will thank youuuuu
TSLA ready for blastoff any minute now
Just hanging out at 18. 20 tomorrow? 20 Monday?
I say yes
People will just order their drugs from Amazon

Long $AMZN
Who the fuck keeps selling pltr? Lol
hell dude, look at today, it seems like it was a buy the dip??? lmfao FIS instantly bounces off hard $142 support

DG bounced off its new support of $208, now holding $210-$211 (what i believe to be its true price, before earnings, hopefully that skyrockets them to $230)

I could go on, check how many stocks held today...

anyway, bro check out dollar general. They have 17,000 stores (15,400 at the beginning of last year) and same store sales have never been down since 1983. Price target after earnings is $230, I think its a good stock considering how poor people shop in apandemic.
Common PLTR do your thing
Sad thing is your probably 90% right the inner option trader within me will come back in like a week😂
[deleted]
Draftkings won't quit
do spac stocks typically moon more than 30% on a given day? CIIC is really making history or somn? is this retard strength indicative of a 20 dollar price target by tm? i think so
> Or lend it to rich people / companies for buybacks and all the assets listed above?

Ding, ding, ding.
PSTH...get in while you can, no downsides.

Petition to give this retard a dollar only need 15,999 to commit.
nio mooning
PLUG to the moon!
All valid points except maybe the girlfriend part.
Buy long dates and only plan to stay in the position for around a month. Theta on 90-120 dte isn't bad.
This battle for 500 is exciting, I have to admit

Just bend over TSLA and take it! Take it you sexy sloot

BABA in the green, we are truly living the end times.
PLTR diamond hands!
Nope.. I heard lvl 2 has a $20 sell wall.  Can someone validate that?

If thats the case it will stay around 17-19 for a little while before it explodes. 

Allegedly
Bought a Bj 40 put yesterday when share price was 43, today the share price is 41ish but my put value has decreased, can anyone explain how that happened?
PLTR leaps on that dip
If we break it I will attribute our victory to your selfless purchase my friend
BABA Launch!
You are totally right, but it will hapend in 1Q 2021 no? there is a lot of time to cash out , meanwhile its free money.. maybe im wrong?

Is GME short squeeze still a meme around here or did everyone forget and hop on PLTR and TSLA? Cause we mooning today I can feel it
Expecting a short squeeze to 50
[deleted]
See you on the other side brother.
Haha dime a dozen.
If you bought CSIQ shares or leaps I'd totally hold. The bi-facial panels are a small part of total solar panel business, and CSIQ is one of the most fairly priced solar stocks on the market. It will grow with the solar push in the coming years.
Amzn really been roleplaying as BABA lately smh
What ticker?
Contradicting yourself big time there.
A lot if its within a few days.
When people say FOMO buying near ATM is stupid......don’t realize that in order to get higher we need to buy at or near ATH......screw off back to the woods bear
Dude.. oil is headed down.  

Noone is picking up new rigs and contractors all over the world are cold stacking their iron and literally scrapping stuff that they don't think will pull work in the next few years.

Risky, risky, play.
When tf is NIO going to hit 50?
Tsla calls definitely a better decision than thots
NIO and XPEV bull flag breakout.
I feel like we never discuss roku. This shit just fucking rips whenever it wants to
Even our boy Baba is going green. Let’s go
RIDE will release the first EV pickup in the market
NIO and XPEV exploding battery cars
Lol why did the post get removed even? What rule did it violate?
this is it. TSLA will do it
DuMp It
yes youre right i hope so!! haha
What positions do I buy lmao
$20 next week.
Ok AAPL do something for once you lazy pos
I have written that I have bought calls, but okay. You are really retarded
To the moon BABA!
Everything mooning

Amzn: “no I don’t think I will”
As soon as I sell PLTR it’s gonna hit 22
Zoom really testing my hands rn
I think imma try selling some puts on it now.
NIO and tittes

oh wait, the DD god did :(
Tesla needs some momentum to break the $500 sell wall
I totally agree. This company is great. Their P/E is low. Underrated company! Also low short float. I can’t wait to keep making money on this company.
please. and thank you
Eat butt
because they took a fat shit yesterday
BTFD FCEL. Thank me later.
Keeping SPY pinned at 0% move XD crazy
Damn, playing with house money is way less stressful

Yeah no biggie in the grand scheme of things cuz this stock is gonna explode. Just sucks seeing -.5% instead of +10% right now haha

The world knows he has zero hope. Hes just playing it to keep grifting the retards in his base who keep giving him money

Holy shit what's happening? I'm actually about to break even on my CRWD calls.

Market is 54% bull right now overtaking last nights 60% bear market. This is the time for calls boys.
SOLO was a $1.10 now $8, the next NIO?
RH knew all along

When will CRSR stop fucking mooning holy shit
I wonder what’s gonna be the catalyst that brings down this market
The price is the truth, fundamentals be damned
Heard it here first.....

RIDE let’s go!!!!!🚀🚀
im flying SOLO
BUY TSLA BUY BUY BUY BUY
Solo and Kndi are popping off
Die Uber
🌈🐻💥🔫
🤤
Scenes if CIIC reaches 20 before PLTR
happened the past 2 or 3 morning in a row didnt it?
That’s what I’m saying, and an insider bought 750mill worth of shares this week like wtf is going on.
What was with the gap up around 9:54? PLTR
Riding this SOLO short bus all the way to valhalla

Or the bread line

TSLA calls for December 18?? Thots??
[deleted]
Well let's hope ciic brings me profit 🤗. Let's good to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀
So if it tanks to $20, sell before merger?
Nice. I have 12/18 $6 FCEL and 65 shares of CIIC
Noted
Lmao just bought a $800c 11/12 get ready for it to dip to 345
Big green dildos on GME
Because RIDE is a pump and dump and NIO and xpeng actually have a bright future
Annoying ass PLTR sellers
Now you are a true bull
Pltr is going to bust out still today right?
That was inspirational
Etsy mooning 👀
Uhhh ROKU????? Shit went off like a fucking rocket...
How heavys your fomo?!? 😝
No.
Explain to me why NAKD is worth calls? I don’t see it
Look at this FOMO at near all time highs again. Tech, small caps - everything just being bid up. I guess the continued thesis of Fed goes BBRRRR
That's called stage-1 ignition checklist inspection and hazard area sweep completion in preparation for launch.
PLTR bout to shoot past the moon into the stars baby !
depends on how far OTM and time to expiration.

Closed morning gap and now you can resume small sell off... please 🐻🌈
Read up on the company they are 2nd to telsa and not by much you will regret assuming this is jusr another ev company or something.  Its not a pump and dump company!
Tesla can’t go down
Been playing small Tsla swings with dailies selling at 20% gains with about 25k in leverage all morning, up $20k on that.
I never bet more than 10k on any short-term options play. It's called bankroll management kiddo, and why I'm not broke.
Once again, this sub know nothing, just a bunch of vested interests competing against each other
Man I wish I had this much money to invest. Growing from 600$
I can't believe it. I finally did it.

I finally bought options on the stock that everybody is using as a shelter during a market downturn, instead of doing the exact opposite and having everything expire worthless.
NIO!!!!!!!

Thank you Papa Elon. You have saved my account
It is! It’s the S&P 500 going back to 1871 on a logarithmic scale. I made it! And I’m a multimillionaire who retired at 36 for what it’s worth.
u must be trading the wrong TSLA
its like the CRSR guy said..daytraders?  500 Million market cap
I bought 100 shares yesterday at $45.
COTY is still on my watch list when we all became makeup experts and that shit is up 15% today
Just want to say no matter what you’re going through or how you’re feeling, I love you all.

Even you fucks who post a bunch of spam in here.
theyre 🏳️‍🌈🐻that are just mad they saw the DD when it was $15 and didnt buy
We need CIIC to shoot to the moon again. Any predictions?
Tendies > politics
Thanks! Just saw it on Twitter. Why a bummer. Really wish I hadn’t moved some cash out of SOLO and into CSIQ for earnings. 

Live and learn!
Not sure. It seems pretty nutty to me. Just bought a 40c 12/18 and letting it ride
I think I’ll hold Tesla until Monday. Don’t fail me now Elon 🙏
Trusting nobody but NIO at this point
Calling TSLA a boomer stock 😂 Maybe Buffett will get more involved then.
Lol, so much angst around PLTR.

It's over for the moment. Sell the news.
crash will happen when the fed raises rates in 2023, not sooner not later
could see a NIO rally today and possibly into Next week
bought one 475p lol
give us a +1% day baby! you can do it SPY
im so excited to see some robin hooders play 0 dte since they can now. should make wsb a little more exciting
Yeah got in AH at $16.25 and dipped out 5 mins before open. Nit a big deal went with how I felt and expected a dip. No skin off my back
RIOT is going to moon today I can feel it in my plums
Die uber
This was amazing
Hey CIIC, keep going up you donut
SOLO $10 EOD??
[deleted]
Cough cough....
The fundamental problem with gay bears is that they spend their time thinking about how other people are wrong instead of using their smooth brains to find opportunity. Nobody likes gay bears. Bulls don't concern themselves with the opinions of gays.
**looks like meat's back on the menu boys!**
Edit: So it seems I just had to shout this out into the world. It updated now lol
PLTR please break 19, everyone will be happy
 “bUt MuH rUgPuLl”- gay bears in shambles
At this point not sure why WSB isn't dumping NIOs, XPEV, etc., rally is over and jumping into RIDE which is American.
Plug will haunt me. It was my free stock and I didn’t go all in when it was only 2$
Am I the only one who thinks PSTH is a giant scam? “But dude the deal is coming soon!”
Urge to buy...rising.  Must...not...FOMO.

GAHHHHHHHH \*purchases 2500 1dtes\*
$LOW $155-160 calls for january are virtually free money.  The sell off was way, way overdone.  IV is so reasonable.
That’s MR retard to you
Damn sold Roku at 230 last week
Sold my 11/20 yesterday for a bigly loss. You’re welcome
[deleted]
This is the part where tech takes over
28% thats alot. If that sector dies they better find another great company to pinch. Affirm ia big in the watch community, but most there pay with dat cash
What the f PLUG
Ur wish finally came true.
Never buy before 10
Yeah, I've had a shit week, really need to see some green
Cant go tits up
Tech stonk, people moving money to companies recovering from covid lows
[deleted]
Jesus, if you sell PLTR because of George f’n Soros, I’m disowning this sub. It took the old bastard this long to learn what they do? Honestly, screw him. Sounds like a 🌈 🐻 with ethics. That’s not the WSB I know. We don’t care about that crap here. Don’t be some pussy bitch and sell. Hold the line.
Dude calm down it’s wsb it has always been this way
[deleted]
So I am yet again telling y’all if you want to make money get in on NIO before 60. You heard it here first. My bank account proves that I give good advice. And to everyone thinking about selling off please do it because I want to buy more dips
NVDA should have invested more time in their 3080 supply instead of leather jackets
Well to be fair its going into the snp500 and they increase the value to 540 and many are saying it can reach 1000 all the way to 15000 per share but I think 1000 to maybe 2500 more realistic.
Is soros just a dumb boomer? Yes
My fun GME FD needs several more dollars of pump... maybe that wasn’t fun, just stupid
Spy you fuck
I wish it is a WSB trade that tips TSLA to over 500
lol wmt this morning is just a vertical line up
Gotcha
[removed]
[deleted]
Market erases big red open....meanwhile AAPL: 🥴

This boomer stonk is like me, pretty much given up on life.
Is there someone who doesn’t want Tesla at 500 or smth?!??
Bloomberg terminals are the most boomer shit ever. The user interface looks like it’s straight out the 90s
Yo what's GME doing
Sometimes I ignore watching the chart for my positions and just read comments here and that lets me know how my retard portfolio is doing.
Dip swallowed
I was cash gang but jumped into TSLA calls because why not. Cash sitting there is boring and banks suck. Maybe put some in shitcoin and hold?
Woahhhhhj
Jack Ma needs to make a TikTok being tag teamed by Xi and Vice Premier Liu He for BABA sentiment to shift.  

He seriously pissed off Xi and the CCP.
It's okay just break 498 and then we'll worry about 500
If Corsair has another 12% i don’t know what I’ll think of this market anymore 🤡. Market cap is so low that this volume is probably spiking it with all the day traders. Cashed our my 12/18 35c today
Triggering my stop loss
NiO and Erection , name a better duo
give us 500 elon
anyone here think BA can finally stay above 200 ?!
[deleted]
>gifting

\*grifting
my name. is NIO
We will be fine
GME! Is it happening!!!
The current system is designed for and by the “elites”. Why would you fight against it?
Nice work bears! 35 seconds today
😩😂
Imagine selling PLTR on the daily opening dump
#PUSSIES STOP SELLING


^^please ^^babes
Lol. George soros is selling his whole stake in it soon so watch out for the price dump. Buy puts that expire in a month if you actually want to make some money
Bigly
500 is the level to watch if it breaks this bitch is running
Looks like a lot of bullish to just be in a “put” position. You can’t time it that’s correct and you will most likely lose money on all your positions. 

Just short shares you cheap fuck
yall remember when a monkey w darts beat those hedge fund guys with degrees in economics
Tell me why the Stonks Boss doesn’t want UBER past $50?
Goodspeed PLTR, you magnificent autist. Onwards to $20
It’s $17 confirmed but can’t find a way to put order in. How about you?
Nice day so far thanks to TGT and NIO
Wth are my TSLA calls not changing. As if IV is THAT high??
trader, not retard
bought at 19 :D
While people paper hand this shit, whales have been gobbling up most of the shares. Sure that rkt doesn’t have a lot of shares floating but it’s stupid af that 80+% of the company shares are owned by whales.  Rkt makes the most from refinancing and there are still roughly 70% of the people that could save at least 100 dollars a month from refinancing so the market from that is far from dead. Personally I’m lowkey just as confused as you are cause with the 1bil buyback within 2 years can’t stop this pos of a manipulate stock from going downward, I don’t know what can.
PLTR 20

 I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN
I have 12/4 $140 puts on em
Only losers are still buying NIO. 😆
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
SOLO is actually insane lately. Missed opportunities
GME go for launch!!
nniiceee
I guess people think CCP will put a stranglehold on it.
[deleted]
go fuck yourself clown
Does not deserve /WSB
I would’ve thought PLtr was up 5 points the way y’all are talking about it.
SPY 351 puts
Why is this happening its like having a random boner but not knowing what set it off, a cool breeze through the window maybe? The smell of a bee? Why is tesla pumping and why is my cock rock hard
I should’ve trusted myself yesterday and went cash gang until I could scoop BA calls this morning
[deleted]
Your grandpa was a cunt
Precisely. IWM too. 5min Chart, truly 😂 What a joke.
You better hope they make a vaccine or EV tonight
Gl bro, playing with fire honestly
Following you this morning :D
Don't you love it when you place limit orders, the stuck goes up so you buy at market price instead, then it goes back to the level of your limit order ? I know I do lol.
TSLA about to try 500 again.
Just watched that like 50 times hahaha 😆
FCEL 12/18 $4.5 and $5.5
CRSR 2/19 $40
NIO 2/19 $60
This is perfect

Well done Op, well done
$JWN 

Hop on next stop tendie town

Fuck you bears

FUCK SOROS
UPWK put options for $45 getting premium printing money today.  Up from $5 during covid crash in mid $30's will only go up more
Fuck I bought spy puts
The cons outweigh the positives. I get it though, nobody wants debt, especially over some dumbass degree that wont help much but im just a firm believer in pulling yourself up by the boot straps and doing things yourself. I wish school was cheaper, its fucking rediculous but they keep bloating the administration and adding extra shit that “will help students” like a writing lab or math lab or counseling or advising or ...

Need a pull back to 479 so I can buy back in? Is this realistic? :(
Tesla too low spy too high
PLTR trying to go up, come on buddy you can do it!
LOL at any pussies who got spooked out of PLTR in the last 20 minutes.
pltr is the best covered call stock to play in the world
I have a very similar position, I personally don’t think TSLA and SPY will be correlated for the next month
It’ll be $23 by Christmas
wtf is pltr doing chart is wierd af
Depends on the time frame and the volatility. If its close to expiry then the answer is a lot.
[deleted]
give me my dub goddammit
Every time we get near 498 the invisible hand of the market seats us back down
**Bulls study for hundreds of hours for the ACT, go to Top 10 undergraduate-ranked Ivy League colleges, attain their Master's then get their P.H.D.s, perform decades of research on various vaccines and immunological diseases, and are eventually awarded various Peace Prizes for their contributions to science**

Don't worry, pltr is going up up regardless of what happened the first 30min today.
Boeing is mooning
Great, thx. Out for the moment after 20% gain.
Now this is WSB quality TA [👍](https://emojipedia.org/thumbs-up/)
Positions were $500 Tesla calls expiring next week. See previous posts for prior positions. 

It’s been a wild ride but now I’m gonna go pay a fuckton of taxes and buy myself some nice things. 

Maybe a chicken sandwich. 

And donate to the autism foundation.
GME volume already half of what it was the entire day yesterday. Yeah we're pumping today for sure
Tesla 7000 when?
this encouraged me to buy some PLTR FDs, but not +50% OTM like this retard
9 days red for BABA. Starting to think it’s dead

I hope so man- turned 19k into 400k off Pton and still have 2,500 shares. I want more bby!!!

Apocalypse Wow!

Def a dip from uncertainty but zero chance. Just more whiny tantrums.
Im not joking. After what Ma did to ccp? Antitrust is a new thing for China, and the first target will be Alibaba
Stopped reading at "market is massively overvalued". As if the market cares.

$16 😅
Ahh. I love these trickle up days where I can actually realize my gains and not be rushed to sell every damn call
Yup
Honestly, go look at all the other spacs charts. This thing isn’t merging soon, and the price will fall back down and you’ll be left bag holding. Be careful
What was guidance like
Dkng?
TSLA about to go up or down, got it
Boeing just wrecked me
i put a market order for 100 shares at open, 16.31 entry now chilling at 17.20. easy 5% in 10 mins

Greatest story ever told!

AMZN is retarded?
Tesla price action is nuts. Literally no other stock moves like it
How did you manage that. I didn't even see $19.24 on my chart.
DIAMOND HANDS ACTIVATE
In reality, both groups of fatass idiots sit around making dumbass comments like this.
Yeah but Big Al says dogs can’t look up.
It can hang below 19.5 through Friday so my covered call isn’t ITM

Chewy!!

Someone asked me about it in the thread. I don’t own any and I posted why.
How do you quantify that? Compare their revenue and ebitda to their nearest competitor COOP. COOP bought back a paltry $100m back in July, no dividend. RKT buying back 1B and talking about a dividend to return cash to investors over a buyback (they got pushback over doing buybacks instead of a divvy). Although sometimes good companies don’t make good stocks.

Oh 100%. I have a peloton and trust me no one who has one is giving it up to use another app that doesn’t come with equipment. But people who just use the peloton app for at home workouts might switch to Apple fitness instead. Even if they don’t though, pton price will still drop the day Apple releases fitness +. If you look at when apple announced it a couple months back you can see pton drops mid day during the presentation
Very confused boner today. 

Need TSLA to continue 🚀🚀🚀

While holding SPY puts 11/20

Someone tell me TSLA isn't in the S&P yet and that it will be okay

REITs have had a run up after the vaccine but are still historically cheap. You have to pick stocks and not buy etf’s- you may actually have to read the annual reports to find out who their tenants are. Same with selective Retailers had value pre vaccine, probably still some right now, industrials as well. Stock screen for lowish debt and dividend yield coverage and you will find a bunch that will likely beat the S&P.  Also banks are cheap and over the next few years you will get outsized returns if you pick right.
FLGT, CLSK, STWD, RDFN
Buffet bought stocks. Our lord is bullish, we bullish. Fack you gay bear
Tsla I can see you want to break 500, just do it baby just do it

SPAC that just acquired the future of EV vans to be used by UPS (and vaccine delivery)
If tesla touches 499 one more time I'm back in because that's a bullish pattern
Zoom needs to make up its fucking mind
FCEL is crazy.....
You can see the demand is there because it's knocking on it over and over
lol. Adobe sign, hello sign, pandadoc, esign and another dozen. When i video conference, I use the verb "I zoom". When e-signing, I never hear anybody says " I am going to docu"
At the very least, buy shares.

Shut up, I need it to be at 165 by January
Its a EV SPAC like NKLA and HYLN were. Get in now at near the ground floor
LOW misses earnings by a penny and drops 13$ a share yesterday and came back 2 so far. Let’s pump this stock boys and make some money
Yes... ENTER!!
[deleted]
Sold my SPY puts at open and picked up some MSFT calls
[deleted]
Temporarily yes, I'd wait for a solid dip personally.

It'll definitely dip even if not this week. But almost certainly this week IMO.
What is your review on it ? Curious to know
What's the play
Was gonna buy premarket at $15.80 but waited for a dip that never came. Avg price $17.30 now rip
I am way too over leveraged in AMZN, I should have sold yesterday for a profit while I had the chance...
how do we know if it’s a hedge or a bearish play?
wsb seems ultra bull on tslut.  Buying the pootz.

5x tsla 11/20 450p
It needs to do a lot more than that.
No, stock will be fine.
Would anyone who got in PLTR at 10 buy more now?
Goodbye NVDA
just sold all my ciic, hoping to get back all in at 16.5 or somn a lil less outlandish lol, great run
TSLA and the battle for 500. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!
I fall for the bear trap every time
what do you think you fucking autist, would a non-retarded be here?

Be more careful going against the people that own the deepstate.
Picked up shares a bit before the model 3 announcement, have held them since. Buying a house next year, so will sadly say good bye to most of my stock account.
I have no interest in paying 50% of my income instead of capital gains tax which is ~25%
We're not worthy. WE'RE NOT WORTHY!

Investing in IBIO is the stock market equivalent of shoving a stick up your arse.

amazing, bought in ~15
Thanks lrn you bitch.
FACTS
I did a bad thing
Thanks for listening
FAANG has no momentum lately
Yup! And people were like “they dILuTeD sHaReS”
Your friend will be fine holding shares but his options better be long-dated. Nvidia isn’t going anywhere with or without COVID vaccines.
look at GME go
either that or dumping to 460. it's fucking bonkers.
You mean Chinese Trevor Milton?
It is deflationary. If its inflationary why is there no inflation.  Either that or the market is so deflationary that nothing the fed does matters in which case we really are fucked and jpow is just fucking winging it.
Bro my grandpa was a war hero of 1685 and actually had to hold the line in which the enemies took over while he let his side retreat so this offends me

Did a yolo call on solo made hell money it’s a good day 🚀
The fuck just happened to RIDE?
A short squeeze melt up would be fantastic today
Fuck me holding these spy puts after opening sell off
CIIC will literally become ARVL, are you retarded?
I never buy puts only calls at the right time
you told me and i didnt listen, forgive me dad
This
I feel the same. I'm only in with about 30% of what I think I should have been. Too late now.

But there is still a chance nothing will happen these day and we will only have an announcement in January or February, in which case I expect it to dip back to 22-23. If it does I'm probably going all in too (with my cash - not liquidating any existing assets).

How about ET!
Why the fuck didnt anyone else buy PLUG after the crash this week? It was free fucking money
If you’re serious, do not get into options trading without understanding it first. Watch some videos on youtube to get a better understanding of what you’re doing. I recommend “InTheMoney”’s channel personally
I'm letting jesus take the wheel on my ciic

This battle for 500 is epic
TSLA about to run up and outperform market again or trapping you idiots into 1DTE OTM calls lmao

Yeah, some amazing plays just don't. But nevertheless, that's still a nice instant profit.
IV too high everywhere. Can’t find a good entry
have 978 shares. never letting go. Bought some calls when it was at 12 too. unfortunately sold those at the 15 mark.  


PLTR is going to be the stock you wish you bought 4 years from now when its trading at 100+ a share
Are we fomoing into Tesla still?
Literally anything
Soros is a wrinkly ball sack
We out here
I’m glad a cousin told me to buy LMB when it was 4.40 a share in like august. 

What’s 20x3? Brrrrrrrrrrrrr
Just bought crsr it better moon
All in on SPY Calls got it
The shocking thing about TSLA spiking 20% in two days is that it hasn’t even been the most talked about stock here
PUSSIES STOP SELLING $CIIC

^^^please
Ok so I see CIIC being pumped on here by a ton of people and have never heard of it before. Where exactly did y'all hear about CIIC to begin with?
Idk I jumped in at open because I have smooth brain. fuck it just buy
No hold. Remember: Diamond Hands
Soros dumping PLTR, not stoping us!!
Did I finally buy a 1DTE SPY call that's actually not going to fuck me for once?
Long term yes, you can make some actual predictions,  and barring any unusual or unexpected events, you can probably do better than pure luck. I’m talking short term for sure. It’s just gambling.
Maybe not
whats the news on amzn?
Bullish. Buying PLTR Calls.
Everyone seems convinced it’s fucked but idk why.
NKLA is just PLUG away to moon!!! I hope they make it happen.
Good luck. Drill Kings calls are pretty cheap right now
PLTR gang hold the line! We got em right where we want em
I want to see some SONO gains porn
we gucci
Jesus christ aapl. Guess I should just put all my money into coin
Is HYLN anything here?
what is his reasoning?
Happy with my SPY put return after open, could be a theta day from here, taking the day off and will reload calls EOD tomorrow.
Are you gonna excervise the call or sell it? I’m kinda new to options trading tryna wrap my head around options
COTY baby
They merged and are trying to be TTD- not v popular atm but I’m gonna bet they will be
FSR earnings run up is beginning?
Sold my CIIC, going to reload after pullback.. maybe.
shares \~$35 not to high? PLTR is the wave
0.05%
Take the price of the call/put, multiply by 100. Call this number *YOLO*

Take your account balance, subtract $100 (to cover transaction fees), divide it by *YOLO*. Call this number *GAYBEAR* if puts, call it *PAPAELON* if calls.

Round *GAYBEAR* or *PAPAELON* down to the nearest whole number. Enter this number into the box that says "Quantity: ". In the box that says "Order Type: ", select *Market.*

Should move to finance, erybody is VP
Alright which one of you bought CIIC at 18$ I know at least one retard did
Major cocksucking happening on SPY
13% GAIN? ILL TAKE IT BABY
Positions? Calls or shares?
So buy puts, got it. But what is VXX and why buy calls? Is it some reverse etf? I see it mooned when the March crash came, what is this voodoo?
Sold nio at open since i thought it would dip at open again like the last 2 days, now it moons, of course
Glad I sold my BJ's run up call and only used some of the profit to buy a 45c yesterday. All they had to do was provide guidance and they'd be up FFS.
Uh zoom what are you doin buddy?
Positions?
Profit is profit
DKNG at 35 was a gift
stop selling pltr you weak handed hoes
Probably gonna drop a lot, that Army contract was already priced in and the retail hype is dead
I think Tesla gonna go upsies wupsies
Overreaction

Chairman Xi loves Chairman Mao

Idk why but if I do see TSLA crashing, it feels so gratifying although I'm not a bear lol
Damn SPY with the fucking reversal!
Why do I just stare at the CRSR chart every day and do nothing?
sad but true. IF it goes above 20 its only to go back down.
If u hate money, buy Amazon options
Autist just means artist in retard speech
I hope Tesla breaks through 500 today
Wow I actually might make some money today. *signs. “Unrealized gains are just losses”

Melon needs to send another "Stonk is too high" tweet..
Sono to the moon
ZM puts are printing. Was worried there for a minute.
Anyone else buy PLTR for the very first time at the peak of 19.24 yesterday like me?

No? Just me? Ok..
i like money sorry
What does it say?
market green cause of vaccine = amazon flat or red


market red cause of lockdowns = amazon red


what a piece of junk
if we break 3500 next stop seems like 3400 real quick. gl bulls but apart from longs I'm all hedged tf out until Friday close / opex expiry. VX down + stocks down into option expiry = price & time correction for dealers
Nope 502 first then 524
Cdmx has some weird but delicious dishes.
Why do I even play AMZN, you get burned no matter what. It's so oversold yet it keeps going down further.
Corsair printing me free tendies right now
Why buy CIIC when you could get the ARVL?
11/27 25c AAPL so you are absolutely right
Someone quick check if there is an OISC ticker, this retard maybe speaking in code
PTON go back up, you garbage
In profit on my TSLA weeklies (11/20 -> 530 and 570), but I'm holding through tomorrow.  "Diamond Dumbass".
lmfao GoodRx guy on CNBC trying to explain how Daddy Bezos isn’t going to bankrupt him
More positions going pos
Holy shit TSLA looks strong this morning, def hitting 510 today
There's pressure to manipulate it higher before December when early buyers will be able to sell their bags.
Should I get out of PLTR
I activate 7 Tools of the Bandit and JPOW BRRRRRR
BABA higher lows?
Get out of the market before then. Got it
Oh look, another day of bag holding BABA
GRWG broke $30
Sold mine to go into CIIC shares
Feel like 90% of all movement on pltr is retard right now. Still holding throughout this shitstorm though.
nothing is ever certain but it's a pretty high probability
That sound about right. Generally you start seeing the shape the market is going to take for the day by 10-11
My Tesla call I sold on Tuesday is 4.6k from 1.3k how do I stop feeling sad about this
Jmia again jesus
Lol the only reason PLTR isn't dumping is because of the Delta.  Once the pumpers pull out it's so fucked.
George Soros killed PLTR

What’s the move on PLTR for today
Me too, but also all the free leverage expires tomorrow. I was hoping for any kind of commentary from Chamath the last couple weeks. Still wondering if that lawsuit is legit or if it’s permanently clover health

I Bought CHEGG at 75... should I sell ...
Wtf spy I said die
I miss the Roku make you Broku comments. Much simpler times.
Buy the dip and hold long. I think this is going to be a huge company.
I think the only people that complain about this are people who haven’t been here long. Been here for years, and the sub changes a lot... that’s just how it works. If you don’t like the current state, come back in 6 months and it will be different.

Will say that the new mods are legit retarded. Miss when we could fuck with the old ones and have fun and everyone got a laugh. Now nobody talks to them rofl
I just bought DKNG 11/20 $49.5c , DKNG better pump it up.
How’s that looking bud

Homie there’s been ppl saying we’re gonna crash since a year ago. The markets have gone full retard you can’t rationalize it anymore
If I had a lot of free cash I'd be looking at 200+ TGT strikes for March.
You can quite literally read the Greeks on your god damn option and figure it out y o u r s e l f

Hoping this is just the morning head fake and we start heading red around 1030
Lmao i averaged down at open i had the ones that expire tomorrow and bam shit sky rocketed after that lol sold for a 40% gain
Crazy how PSTH is also rising on CIIC.

CSIQ beats earnings? Down 9%. Fuck stocks.
Yeah idk why people act like you have to pick one
Shittiest stock ever
High risk
Right I want my puts to play out
All the analysts that have raised their price targets are Asian. They aren’t doing it because of the company they’re doing it for the motherland. Fucking sleeper agents. In a month they’ll be investigated for pumping their numbers and it’s going to be discovered they’ve only sold like 100 cars. There is no SEC in china

Mother fucking word :(
Dumbest shit i’ve ever seen
Sold a Strangle in BILI for earnings, never heard of them. Closed for 50% profit 😎
I've just noticed that there is often a dip around 950
God I hope so
Thank you OP for this informative post! Really appreciate the effort. I’m a bystander to this so I’ll follow up in a year.
Nio

*HES THE ONE*
AHA!!! You fell for it. I reveal my trap card, Unemployment and Covid Wave 2. This card makes SPY GO DOWN. And this eliminates all your cards and takes all your lifepoints!
My patience is just razor thin. I exit out of stuff too early all the time.
Nio will definitely end around 45 let's be real
FCEL 👀
Idk but literally just picked up a couple 41c weeklies and now you’re making me feel retarded
If you hate money then stay away from CIIC. +20 EOD +25 EOW +30 EOM
so according to this sub the future of the economy is RGB gamer products, shady data companies, and chinese electric vehicles. honestly sounds about right. cyberpunk future
HEY YOU FKN SUITS, WE ALL LOVE PLTR, WE WILL KEEP BUYING IT IF YOU LET US KEEP OUR TENDIES THEN YOU CAN SELL ANOTHER DAY
lol love watching PLTR shake you paper hand poors every morning
This gave me cancer

Are you holding even after this? Am I dumb to think this can go even higher to 10+ soon?
CRSR while you can tons of room for growth
Solo single handedly my saving my portfolio rn
If it holds 502,a run up is highly likely
Jumped out of CIIC at 17.80 would def get back in $14-15
too much IV. Sell call credit if bearish
TSLA 530???
Solo is an ugly ass tricycle

Rotation to tesla
if something hits 500 (not gonna say what, avoid jinx), think we'll run up to 510/520 today?
maybe ur just the type of trader who wants to pay high premiums on 100 iv options that decay to 0, just guesing
Where are all the doubters at?
Up 16%
Y’all big sleepers on VERI
NIO is hilarious
Trust me brother hold it.
Need entry point for CIIC and CRSR
RemindMe! One year

Wow that was the easiest money I have ever made, thanks CIIC
I'm all in on FCEL ans CRSR calls I bought a few days ago, plus some NIO calls I picked up yesterday at close. This  has been my most fun two trading days ever lol. I'm just waiting to see how I'll fuck things up now.
SOLO MOON MISSION SEE YOU ON MARS 🚀
I bought an amzn 3400/3500 spread some time ago.  The short leg is now basically worthless, so I bought it back for chump change.  Time for it to moon uncapped.  Gimme that split, Beelzebos
Why are you acting like nothing happened...
Couldn’t even dip below $18 which is new support
Look at the chart and answer you're own question
youre too late - if job #s are you reason for puts, that also fuels stimmy hopes
Don't fucking sell!!
CRSR making my great-great-great-great-grandkids rich
China EV about to bust a nut today.
ROOOKU GONA MAKE THEM SHORTS GOOO

BBBBROKU!
When’s it time for tsla puts?

Any non-autist predictions for how high CIIC is going EOD EOW and EOY?
Panic sold my NIO weeklies, I feel disgusted with myself.
how the fuck is CCL up?!? im just done
I’m down but why
WHICH DIRECTION SHALL IT GOOO
Is it wrong to think of my CIIC shares as long dated options? XD
Just to add on too that, a while back in the year there were talks of us stopping the site development because of them not having enough money to finish the site
I've heard governor DeSantis of FL called DeMantis before, figured it was a reference
[deleted]
[deleted]
I sold CIIC at $17.18 earlier so if she keeps mooning, GG. Happy with my small profit on a fucking dart throw.
No options though. I refuse to buy stonks like some boomer.
Last PLTR sale before we moon!
For real😂😂so confusing
CRSR GANG the only ones not fading
i think we breaking 500 today
I guess we're just trading between 355 and 355.10 all day

Just die MSFT, Im throwing my work computer that that uses your software
This $pltr dip is amazing

Annnnnnd it’s over
And yet if this all didn’t happen we’d be right where we are now based on the growth of SPY, so we’re exactly where we should be anyway.

Holly TSLA
Soros is just dumping his PLTR on us. Hold strong.
Imagine not buying SHOP calls when it was at 900 right before the holidays . Literally free money 💰
Dang, I bought Jan 2021 calls back in September halfway down the big dip, prob be out like $1200 just on one of them.
Hey man thank you for the read this morning. Saved my butt.

Honestly owe you a number of thousands at this point. 

Thanks for all the work you do man.

Keep it up and hope you stay healthy.

Whilst you suckers are crying over NIO and PLTR, big boy money has been loading on SPCE.
what's updog?
They look great on paper
lol calls it is
CIIC. Super small market cap. Just wait until they get more recognition
Today i sold my April calls on arcimoto for a 30% profit (still keeping 200 stocks), and bought COTY and PLTR calls for febraury. I started trading like 3 days ago and this shit feels unreal, it really seems like i'm not using "real" money, dafuq?
I have 50 contracts at 6. Finally making something
Relax dog, just the usual morning dump
im thinking of buying spy puts, someone please talk me out of it
Tesla I am rooting for you
TSLA 530 today
SOLO engaging that hyperdrive today 🚀🚀
Can we start banning these CIIC retards? No option plays and it's such a obvious pump and dump
Of course
Why be a bull or a bear? Just play the market as is.
SONO activated boosters.
C’mon PLTR pull a NIO
oh my god my TSLA 12/18 500c is printing.

Tesla too high,  how to play now?
Looks like a good day to not look at the portfolio. Off to the gym I go
Monday +100% up now -30%
Wrong way, bozo. It's on a short squeeze. GM deal closing imminent.
I have a sell order set on a 0.01 contract expiring tomorrow lol

Would that do it?

Edit: Found that pesky PLTR 20c I set yesterday.
IPOC?
Calls on draft kings are still relatively cheap.  Free money. Just buy stupid january and feb calls 5-10% OTM and let it ride.
Just getting more cheaper at this point this bitch gonna launch.
Looks like everyone who wanted to buy Pltr based on the news bought during AH last night and nobody thought "Hey i'll buy at open"

Except us.
Sure unless it doesn't
Got out of my TSLA 475c 11/20 at open. Thank you for my first experience with TSLA tendies, Elon.  Still holding my 12/4 525c
How do you see this?
This thing just went from 1/2 to 3/4 in 6 hours.  Calls it is.
SAVE will double their current price go long
BUY ALL YOU CAN!!!
$ 1000 SHARE STOCK!!!
Thanks for ruining PLTR with fomo

As of this morning, I want to formally suck you off

So pltr gunne dump nice
Who’s playing CBAT?
AMD buying out XILINX opened up a spot
TA is bunk, but if enough people are using TA, it will work. That's the ironic truth, don't @ me.
With options you would be outside the galaxy already.
Then go to the bathroom
What’d you call me?!
Razer (RAZFF) is the next CRSR
I tip you my hat Sir
bull flags on QQQ holding up nicely and providing heavy support

bounced off of 289 and should now push to 291 then 292.5
At this rate imma just hold my JMIA calls forever lol...
I sold 7.5c yesterday.  I guess I won't be made if they get exercised.
Let’s go PTON :)
Actually made me lol
Ok I sold tesla as I expect a cup and handle to 460 first as it reject the resistance of 499 like twice one in August one today
It's all over the place wtf
Don't go down there PLTR, you won't like it.
you literally are just drawing lines.... on lines...
CIIC short squeeze?
Opposite
Your an idiot. I knew that company was shit and I bet you listened to all the people say pump it.
agree 100%, last two times i bought puts (ZM and DOCU) not only had I timed it terrible, but had I had a longer strike date I would have made as shitton of cash. I see its totally possible and I was foolish on my timing and strike price/date, but I seem to have a better feel for other strategies. 

still, if i feel the vibe of put buying, specifically on a stock and not the SPY, i  might try doing it and just adjust the strike date.
Really mad I sold all my SOLO calls earlier for a loss. But at least FCEL has made up for it so far
Guess who’s the moron that sold 5 TSLA 420 calls on Tuesday morning
CRSR $40 EOD
who’s in on COTY?
What is cost of $600 12/24?
Bought 15 min ago, and as you can see the stock is down already. Consider this a gift, now you can get a discount.
Nio
pltr is only dipping to cuck the friday options yolos id hop in friday
I guess JD is going out of business. They forgot how to go up
Just tested negative for the Rona. Bearish.
huh?
God fucking damnit Apple.
CIIC............   ^^
Guys thats allot of profit taking
Yeah that’s true
VERI to the moon for the third straight day
Nio and Tesla are on a mission who can hit 5 first
It's fomo
CIIC
"the market is forward looking" -- price goes up, as they add shares,  in a pandemic, with no cruises until early 2021...
I'm no doctor, but after reading premise 4 I can confirm you are in fact autistic 🌈🤡🐻
I really hope this was a bear trap...
NIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Seriously. I'm already deep itm (March $30C from back when it was at $25 ish). I'm expecting it to get back to $40 sooner than later, but it's so choppy and annoying every day that I might cut bait and move that money somewhere else.
How long we holding ciic?
So Megacap tech is just dead? Lol
Correct. All you have to do is sit tight with those funds tied up for possibly months until it all eventually recovers. Ez pz.
NIO doing what it does best...🚀🚀
The swings on Tesla today are fucking insane
WORK to low 30s and DKNG to mid 50s in the next week or so.
You mean buy at 950
I just feel bad for BABA this point.
Yeah I need this shit to get pumped up so I can collect more premium on my OTM calls 😂😂 fr tho I think it’s just the Covid market fucking it. I mean they announce a billi in stock buybacks aka 45.6% of the free float and the stock stays stagnant lmfao how does that make sense?
Fcel got downgraded and said fuck. It’s up 9% lol
Yes we do...
Half and half
Pltr dipped to mid-17s yesterday morning and yall freaked out and then boom she blasted off at 10am. Maybe today same same?
Jesus Tsla
Seriously some BS
So...yeah
Money moves today?
FUCK CCL
MY HOMIEs hate CCL

Uh oh. Targeting $500 again
Literally

Profitable companies have no meme potential.
CIIC to THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Always has been
Do you want to own the shares? If so, exercise the contract. If not, sell it for some gainz
PLTR shuttle experiencing some turbulence from profit takers 😔🤙🏼
AMD STOP IT
Just bought $1k of NIO, gimme another good ride!
Going to $230 by Christmas. Hop on board.
I just prefer to get money faster through $NIO
just did broski
Never too late
Nah. Nothing on mainstreet has impacted wallstreet all year.

They will make sure the big businesses stay open while your mom and pop shops close up, possibly forever.

We'll come out of this with the only stores left being Costco and Walmart, with insane unemployment, and still be at ATHs.
[deleted]
Wtf DLTR, are you not aware earnings are in 5 days??
200 retard IQ post right here
Pivoted out of PLTR at its top at open and into GRWR
So my call is going up in price while the TSLA price falls.... is this IV crush?

Sounds like a possible shortage on tendies coming soon
imagine giving your money to david einhorn so he can lose it trying to short QQQ after watching the big short
Wtf corsair been on these past few days.
Oh I’m in at 18, just would’ve rather been in at half the price lmao
I need to do this
CIIC 30 percent up. How high does it go
Just a cursory glance as charts today indisputably confirms we're drilling. Hopefully down to election level supports at least where I've got a big fad waiting for the Vanguard, and I do specifically mean Raniere, who will EM this market into new ATH
[deleted]
Thanks for the solid DD my friend
Hey trash - MRNA. FUCKING STAY DOWN
Lol this is brilliant this morning
Anyone buy tsla calls at top
Fubo just got another buy rating and a PT of 28 (currently at 22)
CCL giving free vaccine shots with every cruise or something?
I feel a huge dump coming.
Not much to the rich boys here, but I'll take this [gain](https://imgur.com/a/aNccz2c) in less than 24 hours. Thanks again man, sold couple minutes after open.
So the thing I sold a covered call on yesterday is doing the best...SHM

NNDM

Anyone else in this?
AAPL you suck
These dips ALWAYS get bought
So tired of this boomer stock.
I think it would just enable colleges to freely raise their prices to whatever the fuck, knowing the government will just pay it off. But I am one of those bitter folks who scraped to pay off my $40k debt over the last eight years and I’d be lying if it said it didn’t annoy me that everyone taking irresponsible loans could just be let off the hook
BABA gonna swing back to 300+ in two weeks
Look at CIIC go.
And price up 2%.
Any idea when Roblox IPO is?

Here's the thing you have to realize: The people that buy and sell stocks are fickle dumbasses, and will react in the dumbest ways to things.
5% kind of day for NET, watch
This comment is so wrong for this sub
Aw hell, down to the last $10. Puts on my life.

AKBA
NIO back on the menu boys!
PLTR giving everyone that early morning buying dip
lol same
Waitin to pounce on more PLTR calls
Lol at Tesla baiting everyone in at the open then pulling the rug. Not gonna lie, it almost had me in the first half with 3.2 million volume in the first candle
Wow Apple is a POS
Makes you a 3x🏳️‍🌈🐻
That's the solidest DD I've heard. OVER 50%? wow, you must be onto something there
BA BABY!!!!!
Get down to 345 where you belong SPY
ATM pton calls wasn’t smart
Tesla gonna dip at all today? I want to rebuy my call
It refuses to go below 488. This is the lowest it'll be today it would seem if the selloff was less than $10.
Come on zoom. Keep going up.
pltr with its usual morning dip
[deleted]
43-44 area
We need a good day. It took 2 weeks off 😠😒

Didn't I tell you, you would regret not buying CIIC?
GG PLTR
Draftkings to 100 looking more then certain at this point
I’m holding my 11/27 calls, just bought a couple more.
PLTR dip...watch this rocket that's coming
Loaded up on PLTR calls! $20 by EOD
Nursing home employees probably are betting who is next.
Something you use when you got 30 grand to drop and not some little bitch boy 100 dollar Robinhood account.
You're right, fml... Stonks are crazy
I like this. Enjoy your award.
360 pretty juicy
I am in both, but RKT is making a ridiculous amount of money with the rate at 0. They should be flying
Why are we dumping?
Nio coming back from the grave load up on calls
Thanks BA
Put a stop loss on $CIIC, all house money from here.

CIIC ciicw doing well
Is ciigu same as Ciig?
Gyna evs rise and fall together
Once again, CIIC will be 20+ by next week
UPS is already planning on buying these electric vans. CIIC is going to skyrocket.
But the Fed...
Is anyone here really making money?
long dated options move to slow haha
Long term that doesn’t mean anything. Sure they can kick Tesla out and drive their NIO’s for the next decade but what are they gonna do when EVERYTHING switches to electric energy? Can’t power your house with NIO like you will be able to with Tesla
Because its a pump and dump, enjoy losing your money
thanks man, that is a nice comment
That makes a lot more sense.  I’m doing the same, going into value stocks with CSPs or stock when it looks like there’s still some room to run.  

I honestly don’t even like buying Puts anymore...  Been burned way too many times.
where do you think it's stopping?
just give me my motherfucking money
Someone tell spy to get down and stay down
Spy calls or naw
Get out of tesla to hop on the NIO rocket 🚀
he'd prbly enjoy that
Etsy 👀
The current p/e of the s and p is 31.24. Last year it was 21.75. During the dotcom boom it was over 200.  It’s an order of magnitude lower than the dotcom boom.
No it literally just started. EVs only go up.
Nio calls giving me A G I T A baby
Position?
Wtf BA
Check my post history. Mostly shitposting but kinda srs
Palantir is a shitty and horrible company
Buy the PLTR morning dip before mooning
It's not too late for CIIC.   
Are stonks gay? YES, but it's 2020, being gay is in!
If completely changing the system to adapt free trades didn’t cause any harm. 

I doubt calling people out on bullshit will.
fuck that dogshit company. i bought at 28 a while ago and took the L and sold. Made all the money back with Nio and PLTR. join the gang  🚀
So realtalk now, is [marketwatch.com](https://marketwatch.com) really the better [investing.com](https://investing.com)? 

Am I the idiot here for using [investing.com](https://investing.com) to screen during work?
What’s NIO’s resistance line? I can’t pull up ToS run
If this is the kind of steam power PLTR has we’re fucked
Once again, JMIA

Yall need to jump in before it's too late.
holy shit. I did it. I actually sold on the top for TSLA.right at 497... watch it boomerang to 600 now....
PLTR getting hit by profit takers, next stop to the 🌝
Got out of my shitty positions losing only 12%. Held any longer woulda lost 29%......
Yep, TGT just resuming it's blast off from yesterday.

Based on the amount of buys that came in for tesla this morning this is gonna be the lowest it goes today. It's pretty safe to go calls on it this morning. Id say a good time to sell is either tomorrow if it makes a downturn. If not then Id say tuesday.
It could be debated, what exactly is shit
I think klarman found out and trying to out buffet buffet now
That's a lot of drywall corners behind Malone
I fucking hate it it’s so fake

$10K in 10 minutes love days like this.
No, you cunt. Don't taste 489! Taste 500 you slut!
I got in whew
SOLO new ATH
First time I ever bought FD was yesterday. Loaded up on some 11/20 tesla calls and it paid the fuck out. But, I'm never buying weeklies again. Too stressful
 PSTH to the moon lmaooooo
Just shipped it on PLTR 2021 calls 
I for one welcome our new Palantir overlords
I didnt go on vacation, havent seen the inside of a cafe/club/restaurant in months > pumped that money in the market

Multiply by millions of people

This guy: baffled that market goes up
and we constantly verify the old ways to lose money still work
Did ET lower their dividend? I got paid $78 four months ago but only $38 today. Doing the math based on their annual $.61 seems like $38 is the correct divident payment.
Time to get back in on WMT?
Tesla $500 let’s make history!
nio on a moon mission
But RH doesn't support warrants so what good is that to WSB
AEM
Fuck you AAPL
Elon just made about $350m then lost half a billion dollars, all in ten minutes.
Straight up fuckers

TTD making another run at $800 today 🚀🚀🚀
Got out of this fkin degenerate market, I advise the same to you all too
I apparently bought a call debit spread instead of a put credit spread yesterday and I’m super confused as to how. I’m also really confused how it’s not profitable when it’s well ITM now.
We only sell shit like NIO or the DAX.
#TSLA LMAO
The way NIO moves is not good for my heart. looks like its about to dump then goes on a fat reverse green candle
I can't believe I sold my SOLO calls last week
CCL very legal very cool yes
The only bull thesis of 2020, and it's yet to be wrong.
Needs more volume
STONKS
I don’t have any positions in Tsla, but I’m still rooting for you guys
Not like this

🤢
retard
peoples heads get fucked up cos its a round number
MSFT low key going back to $200 and the market isn’t even crashing.... that’s going to make it a lot harder to decide to buy the dip
Buffet is back at it in PSTH
Solo!!!!
breaking SPY 355 today by noon
Holy shit NUAN busting out
I'm from the future, thank you autist ❤ woke up to +20% after buying AH
CCL green... makes sense
PLTR needs to fucking take off
Let's go cic
lets go NET, show em
Ty Riot daddy

Lol it’s coming back to get you 😂
Tesl gunna break 500🌚
Wow RUN with the hulk dick gap up
Based on his comment, looks like he sold for a 32k loss
CIIC 🚀
Why u leave bitch still going up
Are you retarded
Same lol
NIO ROCKETTTTT LETS GOOOOO
Be patient lil fella
Not touching that shit. Tainted by Epstein
Ah, you're a chart trading guru who doesn't understand the difference between the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble and today's market. Thanks for making it easy to ignore you without having to read the rest of your "we're entering a teacup handle with inverted cheerio pattern with a reverse cowgirl trend that is pushing upper AND lower limits and looking for a breakout"
Just closed out. Thanks for the $$$
Too much bearish sentiment here, we are going up
I think we should just face it. CCL is on some bullshit and won’t die again
Atvi at bottom of range, look to hit 78 in 2 weeks
Tsla breaks 500 then we clear for moon landing
SIX is the easiest PUT play with that green candle out nowhere
Yessss
I'm so annoyed right now. I was a day away from locking up nice theta gains in financial tickers, and these damn lockdowns just fucked all those positions in a span of 30 mins.
**IF** student loans are forgiven you can bet your butt there'll be some terms and conditions the indebted would have to agree to.  Perhaps the possibility of never having true ownership over anything ever again.  Their material possessions would become the property of the state or central bank.
Look at that dip being bought
DKNG going 📈
Tesla is so fucking volatile lol. Jump to $500 than $485 and back to $490 all in the first 5 minutes Jesus
STONKS

i really dont understand BABA, is it just algos trading with each other? who the fuck is still selling this shit, why didnt the moron sold like yesterday to a higher price?!
Sometimes i'd really love to see who is actually buying stocks. Like is it algos buying NKLA now after the cult bought it yesterday on a someone linking a webpage on GM tha'ts been up for like a month already?
Did all the shorters and weak hands finally get shaken out of NIO?
500 won't go down without a fight, but it WILL go down!

But I believe in PLTR
FNKO about to fly
They are at a severe competitive disadvantage with a huge debt load.

[https://stocknews.com/news/cpe-callon-petroleum-company-shows-signs-of-hitting-a-bottom/](https://stocknews.com/news/cpe-callon-petroleum-company-shows-signs-of-hitting-a-bottom/)

1. Competitor WLL and DEN has emerged from bankruptcy where common stock was wiped out, and 95% of the market cap was given to the bond holders.   This means WLL and DEN is producing oil at $4 to $5 CHEAPER per barrel because of no interest payments.
2. While the incoming Biden administration isn't going to ban fracking, they are definitely going to severely limit the number of NEW oil rigs on federal lands and increase regulations.  As the bonds of CPE are due in 2023, and the typical oil rig has an 18 month life, that is a horrible intersection of falling revenues and debt repayment.

Maybe can pump and dump due to small float, but definitely bankruptcy is looming.  Just make sure to get out before the big boys crush the hell out of this stock if the pump works.
NO YOU DIDNT
Geez BABA is turning into the next WORK

I just used Toyota because that was in the post. Tesla is priced to grow faster than any growth company has ever grown, they will grow, but they aren't going to do it 5-10x faster than any company in history.

I made the CIIC DD post. Once it reaches $25 next week, I will make another DD post about the next big play..
brrrrr
Tesla gonna have a huge sell wall at 500 but if it makes it past it it'll be glorious. Easily will fly to ATH as people buy in prep for it. Until then we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
You retards actually selling PLTR? Lol
Yes it does idiot, stocks were down like 30% in April, they’re up 60% since. Can’t crash from a bottom
You think the vaccine hype was overdone because companies like Oxy went from 10 to 12, and that the Peloton rally taking it to over 1400x p/e ratio is still good value? You are so sure that you purchased USD 1,000,000 of it?

Got 1000 worth of palantir shares. I'm gonna be a rich grandpa some day
y ccl up?
Agree, only concern is height of rocket.

Look at 3Y chart, its slowly going down bc divident etc. Add six months, extra debt and slow outlook. 

They will stay alive bc of the assets (who else would buy and operate cruiseships), but doesnt look super worthwhile.
Someone with a bunch of penny stocks told me I can't have thousands of dollars on just TSLA and PLTR.

Ah well, 300% is 300%

No, I'm comparing it to all other growth companies. It is priced to grow faster than any growth company ever has in history, and not just faster, but orders of magnitude faster. I think that's highly improbable. Your money your choice good luck.
I am the one who made the DD post on CIIC. This will be 25 by next week.
You must be new here
Seriously how is CCL up on lockdowns and covid sky high
Bulls take the stairs, bears take the window.

Cant tell if this is an attack or serious inquiry but the answer is because they're providing a service and education and deserve to be rewarded for their work like any job.

It is insanely stressful to do call outs for others let alone with any type of consistent accuracy.  Throw in dedicating their weekends to teaching others, seems kinda cheap compared to college tuition.

Don't have to go with them was just sharing what helped me since they asked.

Well yeah I mean technically companies have grown infinite because they all started at 0. Tesla is a big growth company, it's just the growth that is priced in is literally 5-10x more than the fastest growing company in history.

**"Dad, I made a thousand dollars today!"** said the 18-year old, excitedly, staring at his Robinhood account, while he sat in the back seat of his dad's SUV with his seatbelt buckled. **"I'm getting really good at this! I taught myself how to trade,"** he continued to brag.

*"Wow, son, that's a lot of money!"* his dad replied. *"If you keep this up, you could make a career out of this!"*

**"Uh huh,"** his son nodded. **"Heh heh. I was just about to say that,"** he said, as he started to sniff his own farts and pick his nose.

*"What did you invest in, pray tell?"* his dad asked. *"I might even throw in some money with you, since you're making so much!"*

**"I bought this thing called 'calls.' I read some news on something happening with Tesla, and it was REALLY good news! So, I thought, hey, it's probably going to go up, right? And then it did! And I made money!"** his son said happily. **"This is way easier than I thought!"**

Interesting read, thank you! 

I have a small business in the luxury industry and my sales are usually correlated to that week’s stock performance. My business did well during Biden’s announcement for President, but recently has been much slower than usual. My options have also been very shaky as of late, and I definitely believe the stock market will have to rejoin the real economy again. Liquidated my options yesterday and waiting to see what happens.

What the hell are you talking about? I’m pretty sure the PC gaming industry is not anywhere near close to dying, I seriously have no fucking idea where you’re getting this vibe. The fact that you haven’t heard of Corsair makes me think you actually don’t know what you’re talking about. I am not a gamer at all, I play video games once in a blue moon, but even I know what Corsair is. Anyone who has ever owned a PC for gaming in the last decade or more knows what Corsair is.
🤣
i saw, but with ciic, they announced merger yesterday and its mooning, so when this gonna pull back, huh?
You aren’t wrong, but you see the reason everyone put their money into Corsair is because they ARE worth it to get in for the long term. You can say oh well it’s all luck and I guess in the short term sure it’s luck that it ran up so fast. The thing is though that the company, when it ipo’d was absolutely undervalued. They ipo’d at 1.3 billion and did 451 million in revenue in one quarter. That’s telling you something
Because he didn't say it's technically a bad investment.
Time to ride DraftKings into the sunset
this is just a drill

Should I cancel my calls
I just finished a consult for a small PC peripheral company, and I believe you're mistaken. If anything, the market is accelerating. 

Even dipshit Best Buy is stocking computers of a level that five years ago would have been unheard of. They also offer every component necessary to build your own system as well, which is incredibly convenient when you're in a pinch or don't wanna wait for Newegg, or don't have a large PC warehouse in your city.

Consoles are fun, and are an easy way for kids to get into gaming. There are some titles that are best experienced on a console. You don't have to "know" anything, you just shove the game into the tray/hard drive and go. However, they lack a critical function; modularity. Once someone sees how easy it is to be faster by replacing one component, they often go all-in. You can stay way faster than any new console in perpetuity. 

CPU development, the multiplicity of custom cases, fans, cooling, lighting, peripherals, not to mention faster and faster, more customizable RAM, four-digit PSUs, SSDs (*all within Corsair's realm*), not to mention the arms race of the video cards isn't happening and being sold to make Word run faster. It's for and due to gamers, period. 

Due to these facts, having a PC is ultimately a better value. You can buy/build something to YOUR taste, instead of a cookie-cutter console that always has to go away if something go wrong. You can replace parts for less than what a console costs over time, and be cutting-edge @ all times.
Yeah, it’s fundamental to my trading strat

Not sure.  If was supposed to break out after it broke 1918 last month and it didn't do shitttt
1 minute warning
How many you got
Wtf is ciic
What short term indicators do you use?  When the market rejects another top?
Same here
coffee is making me have to poop at the WRONG TIME
Soooo why is NKLA still going up?! 

Edit: Do people know wtf are they buying when they just think it's cheap or what?
Market doesn’t know if it wants to be up or down. Positions equal at this point.
Go tesla, nio, beyond meat and SPCE!
Tries to say quantitative easing is deflationary like it’s a fucking fact...
Are you lost?
There is resistance at 504. If we break that wall then it will be pretty likely to run up.
They are the company in minority report
WSB wouldn't move 0.0001% of BABA
Yea before merger
sook....im laughing
It’s a trap alright. Shit keeps rocking back and forth someone getting hurt today.
Nios going to consolidate around 45-47 for the next month
PLTR don’t give me hope
Sell tsla calls?
My dad tried working for Alcoa and they told him to fuck off
Those are super leaps
He's 250 years old does he even know how to turn on a laptop?
Let’s go everyone, hope everyone has a great trading day!
Writes a 24 page essay about why SPY will drop by 5 points 1 month from now. Nice.
520-525 is the floor.
I’m not in on the weekly, but growth today just validates my longer term OTMs
It'll be back in March, you know it.
NIO 35P six days after their big event where they announce new cars and tech...
He's virtue signaling. This bitch knew what he was investing in off rip. Selling now that he's made a tidy sum to feel good about himself.

Everyone should know that what PLTR has done in enabling ICE isn't the greatest, but we're looking for ROI anywhere we can find it.
This shialon digital combo reminds me of a meth addict that hangs out behind my local kroger.
got fucked by them, dont trust no more
2 min lift off 🚀
Who is buying this stock?
that's me lol when I'm holding positions
I'm scared daddy, how do I turn these paper hands into diamond hands
CIIC
Remember the massive tank PLTR had at open yesterday. Do not panic if it happens again
I laughed so hard at this, legit out loud
Are you part of that other gang?  32 degree theta?
damn I was about to give the last warning to get ciic under 16, but too late, shit runs fast
Sell my FCEL EOW calls for profit hopefuly
I wonder how my VTIQ is doing today?
Ayyyy should’ve bought more CIIC at 15.4
damn TSLA.
5k on CIIC, let’s go

Does anyone stretch besides that one Apple jelk guy before the trading day starts
CIIC
CCL with another stock offering every few weeks so they can pay their overhead and debt interest payments while Ajay cancelling embarkations for January is super bullish lololol
ZM about to flash dump. Buy puts at open. Thank me later
palantir knows that i am going to buy palantir before i do.
last earnings report was a disaster, big players calling it garbage, highest stock forecast says high of $20 till 2022 and for comparison, NIO's highest stock forecast for the same time frame is $200+ and NIO is currently around $40.
Yea that’s always how it goes (except for the giving anyone a mortgage part).
Yup!

Doesn't matter how much we hype, Jack needs to suck Xi's pp
Its the coffee for me.
I’m loaded on warrants and leaps
at WSB, yes
Anyone else get anxiety as the minutes lead up to opening bell each morning
to be honest, im not as confident in OPs position as he is. He even said it himself, how the fuck do you time this?

thats what I meant by actually understand the market, and you seem to understand it because you're asking the right questions

the trend is showing recovery, but the data says we should be flat/down due to overvaluations. the best we can do is just sit, wait, watch prices some more, and buy a dip.

I hope I answered your question, because nobody who trades know what they're doing. Its just about getting an edge, I dont think OPs edge is enough considering how the money is actually flowing. Timing bubbles is hard as shit. In fact, look at Sept 1st-4th, was that really a bubble? Who knows, maybe we just needed a correction. OP is saying we should have a correction, and I agree, \*\*but I'm not playing the correction, im playing a stock like DG or small caps like AES because DG has earnings coming up and there seems to be a rotation in these value names.\*\*

you feel me? I'm confident in my DG and AES positions because of the overall picture that OP gives. Thats why Im not holding AAPL calls or SPY calls, but im also not holding puts.
Interesting read! Thx for the input.
Are jack in the box late last night
Then you’re racist. Obviously
What are your moves for today??
Give money to MM
Because he regretted it for ethical reasons not financial. The company is one day going to track everything we do.
I already took my morning dose of adderall and coke , so I’m call optioning the shit out of spy and Tesla
This stock should be at $14 a share.
Alexa play The W.A.N.D.

bro it goes up 20% in a day tho, safely, no theta, no massive delta...
Because his reasoning is simply “i don’t agree with them lul” this does nothing to the value of the stock

Anyone else in on shop
U think weve hit the bottom or do u see it going lower not sure when to buy lol

Gonna buy $1000 worth of $NIO shares at open. Look at the multiple price targets of $NIO

please say sike
-1.12 EPS oof
Anyone else always have to take a massive dump before market open?
They sell hope
yes
Nice!
This is literally all hindsight. You could make the same “analysis” about any other stock and come to the same conclusion, you’re not going to be right with any greater probability than chance. Easy to look back after you made the lucky call and say “clearly this is why it went up, it was objectively obvious”. It’s all luck, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Unless you are an institution, then it’s literally just big money power, highly advanced algorithms, and taking advantage of dumb money (us).
Goin’ straight back to $360
What about RKT?
Best of luck to you retards today. Go PLTR 🚀🚀
this_is_fine.jpeg
Month long term, idk. Look at that 3 month chart jesus
I love when economists use the price of milk for their reasoning that inflation is under control; meanwhile, houses have doubled in 5 years across the US.
You see its going down, and you see that two times it went down this dramatically it went right towards 330. Calls on spy!
PLTR
I do.  I listened to the earnings conference call and it got me hard AF.   My 1/22 20c are going to fling print one day.

People are retarded bro. Some people went on a cruise like last week .... most people caught Covid but that’s beside the point lol.  
Also that’s why 2023, vaccine should be coming in in good quantity by mid 2021. Realistically, Jan 2023 is like a year and half away from the time the vaccine would be generally available. Your point is why I’m not looking at 2022
“🧐 Huge? Can’t see it, average at best”

Quick give me a 1000 bagger
Which ticker to gamble my rent today?
Yes!!!! I think this is the first Rick and morty reference I’ve ever seen on this sub
:/
Been eyeing it myself. Black Friday is supposed to have a bundle that hasn't been announced yet. Probably a carrying case and game pack or something.
I made a very similar post like 2 weeks ago, be careful.  

A lot of this info is coming from Steven Van Metre on youtube (not actually this guy once again) and I bet on the vxx spiking from a lot of the same info then.  

The timing burned me pretty badly but I still think the theories are correct.

My advice to you guys is to use a debit spread on VXX calls to limit damage from theta a tiny bit and to also make the expiration longer than a few weeks, though the US should be locking down to some extent by then which would serve as a solid catalyst.  

Good post overall, made more sense than variation separate ever did, all that guy was good at was formatting in reddit markdown.

I’ll say VXX 22/25C Debit sometime in january.
[removed]
Oh I will
winning, winning, winning
I fuck with them
No i think you missed the boat on that one for now. They have a fuckton of backlog to work through and a tight free cash flow situation until people start flying again
Diamond hands!
Sell em
Lol no
Looks extremely bullish
Price target 230
Closest possible to In The Money 2023 calls is what I’m looking at currently. Unless they go bankrupt this is like a 5x easy
Currently on my last roll 😐
I started playing longer expirations (30-50 days out) with closer otm strikes and it’s really hard to lose unless you’re fomoing in on a run.
When is the apocalypse?

Hmmmm?
!remind me January
All of them Behemoths, integrated into the life's of all of us. And then there is 500 billion dollar TSLA.
AAPL doesn't announce anything beforehand that's why the market can't see what's it been up to. it's always speculation. for now they are just phone and mac makers. They need to give bigger guidence in terms of apple pay as may be a future bank, health care world, software for self driving cars...
Feb dated, hell yeah.
Yea theyre even more retarded than i am, which makes them perfect. Who cuts their stock in 1/3 on purpose? Price manipulation is 1000% going on here, and u can tell theyre going to buy lowwws and dump it after a month maybe less.

Add that to the fact that were going into a lockdown soon all us stocks are gunna plumit like they did on march 16th

Black friday stock deals tbh

Yolo it out!

Alright thanks. Kinda reminds of the scene in The Big Short where the mortgage lenders were talking about how they were just handing out mortgages to everyone and the big bank would buy it the next day.
Cruise line or airline, I think Expedia is on there
Cope
NVTA or CRSP???
it's funny cause you know its going to rocket out of nowhere at some random point in the future, just who knows when. Like it'll be mid next year, nowhere near earnings just rocket to 40+.
Wait I was going to go into CIIC but bitched out I don’t trust SPACs pre merger
Next month or January.
Yes your picture doesn’t say you will be up. It says next year will return 11%. No where in the pic does it say my stocks can’t tank in December to recover only 11% across the year lol
>Cause first thing people gonna do is get on a cruise with the 0 dollars they have left in their bank account.
SPY 360c 11/27 seems like easy money which means I'm gonna buy it and SPY gonna head to 350
NKLA is more like a shit coin
Zm IV is stupid high on weeklies
Made this mistake yesterday. Selling at open before it dumps more
I'm not going to tell you what to do with your money, but I was burned by them bad in Oct (stock offering) and they're an older company that still isn't profitable almost 60 years later, so before you do, look very closely

NKLA functions as what investors think gold does
PUTS ON CCL FREE MONEY
No options, no one cares
Yeah that’s why I would only buy super long dated call closest possible to ITM. I mean if this returns even close to pre Covid prices, 20$ 2023C would print like 5x
M1 chip. 

But I think msft is a better play. Looking at calls. They're cheaper. Less IV. New console out.

I have a feeling it’ll go up to $40-$50 range like Hylionn before merger then dips hard after

All my positions barely up, while fraud like NKLA and Yy up bigly, should I just rope right now? I dont think I can take this shit anymore.
If you want some stability in your portfolio grab some shares of a REIT or two. I'd recommend NRZ and AGNC.
No, they all target you specifically.
Lots of words and charts mabye he's right
Sell them yesterday near close
so you decided to waste more time post that here. makes sense
FUBO blasting off again today???
that's some shit CEOs made up to prod us drones into thinking we need to give those cphunts even *more* of out lives
tldr; this is too long for me to read before opening bell

Also, this is why I invest in things that can't fail if we have a coronavirus winter mini-depression, like Chinese cars, or in things that have bottomed out so far they can't fall much more, like oil & gas producers

Except for people who don't think about these things, it's already factored into our investments.
tsla ath today would be cool
Zoooom
Thats not how this game works
Do you want red sauce or green sauce with it?
This is a troll right?

Like you're just trying to fuck with this place right? 

Cause nobody who is allowed on the stock market should truly be this fucking retarded
Any of the others most likely
And by judging most of the comments, I’m going to say you hit the nail right on the head
What's your expiration? I think the company will be insolvent soon
you dumped her to look for new pussy and you think you get to be mad about that
commenting on this so i can come back to it
some of you guys check this sub every 5 hrs and it shows... how tf are you still talking about baby gains in pltr when CIIC is about to fucking MOOON
For those looking to get into CIIC I highly advise to wait a couple of hours. It’s going to dip. Refer to KCAC
I literally laughed out loud at this
IIRC there's a tranche of institutional shares from IPO that unlock beginning of Dec. They're propping it up until MM can dump

I’m about to buy calls on NVDA because it killed earnings and went down and the analyst upgrades are pouring in as usual plus IV has/will be crushed. Can’t go tits up.

Puts on your sphincter.
Yeah I got 13 different puts on CCL expiring Friday. Shits retarded.
Calling March and 08 "dips" is a joke, and also a semantic argument.

Obviously in the long run stocks go up, but you still don't want to be holding when the market tanks 20%+....

You could probably get 10 classes at a local school. Thats basically a degree. I got over 100k in loans. Yes I couldve stayed at a state school and only had 10-20k, but we have this belief that we should be all we can be, right? My brother went into the navy and my dad said one son is enough. Isn’t it enough for a son to take direction from his father? So instead I did all I could. I made the leap to a more reputable school and took the most challenging route I could. 

Then I got out and you know what the markets like? Fucking dreadful. You don’t make money in science. You can only make money if you a lame ass salesman or somehow get into some finance shit. 

This country has killed innovation in favor of advertisers and clever sales tricks. It has looted from the producers who keep society running and improving. 

You want me to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars and then I am forced to work these slave wages to pay them off. I have to pay 1000 a month for the next 20 years to pay this shit off. All because I believed a lie about the American Dream and you just gotta listen to what your told. 

Luckily I believed in $TSLA, too. 

Thank you for listening to my life story.

> every reserve dollar the fed creates can inject 10 dollars into the actual economy.

And there is your flaw. That’s just it: the banks are NOT lending into the actual economy. If they were lending the trillions created into the real economy, inflation would be ? - can’t even guess. The trillions are going into asset bubbles. Treasuries, fine art, classic cars, high end real estate. Those nearest the spigot get the most. The 0.001% 

The commercial banks are terrified of lending rn: can’t be sure they will get it back. Ultra low interest rates also reduce their traditional ‘cut’ for servicing the loan.   


You are a bank (Or any other primary dealer) Fed says ‘here, take this credit with us for your debt on your books’. Bank says ‘yes please! ‘. Liability transferred to Fed. Now bank has ‘new’ money. What to do? Lend it to the debt slaves on the treadmill and put up with all the admin, complaints, sob stories, etc?  Or lend it to rich people / companies for buybacks and all the assets listed above?

From now on any position that goes up 50% in a day, I sell half.
Ok, so I wanted to ask about that...  I can see going long with some of these positions using stock.  But to be going short with short exp options?  That seems incredibly risky in this weird market.  Even complete scam stocks like NKLA are randomly shooting up 10+%.  

How are you (or OP) gaining confidence with timing, other than just guessing at an overall trend?
what they do?
Hey if we're going to go this route, dont forget to burn the bastards at the stake that are pumping this market to extremes too.  Raising price targets for no reason.

Oh, that's good to know. Maybe i'll look into that. By 3 years I'm sure they will have a slim or pro model i will probably upgrade to anyway so I only need it to last that long.

hello darkness my old friend
Economy is going to take another blow too. Sad almost 2k people dead yesterday. And that’s probably not the peak 😢

But then again who knows. Roku calls either way
underrated comment
Implied volatility just tells you the market sentiment as to the likelihood that the price is gonna swing. Higher IV means the market thinks it is more likely that the price will move greatly in either direction, could be up, could be down, doesn’t matter, just that it is likely to move and move big. This makes the option contract more expensive because it is potentially juicier but also riskier at the same time. Big potential to have the bull catapult you to the top but also to get reamed by a bear. IV is factored into the options price, so higher IV means pricier option, and the closer you get to expiration, obviously also the lower the chance that the price moves big enough since time is running out, so IV tanks, which means options price tanks, which means even if the price has moved in your favor, in either direction, if IV has dropped even more drastically, then you can end up with an option that costs less than when you bought it, which obviously means you lost money, this is IV crush. This is also why short term options such as weeklies fuck people over even if price moves favorably in your direction, because IV is high on day one but by the end of the week it is in the gutter, so unless the stock price literally explodes overnight or in two or three days, or utterly tanks, whichever works for you, you are gonna get IV crushed. The drop in IV is usually greater than any value appreciation you get from the price movement.

Closing 1 leg at a time has risk. Underlying can change dramatically and prices fluctuate like crazy if its the day of expiration.

Well my plan is to maybe snag one from Walmart today, keep it for 30 days or 90 days (whichever it is. I looked at the policy just now and it looks like it's 90 days), and return it right before the return window ends and buy it from Costco which will hopefully have it in stock by then. Because Costco has a lifetime return policy. 

Just in case this thing breaks. I'm always weary of buying brand new stuff. Already seeing reports of faulty units

Tesla, it deploys one of the most if not the most advanced stationary battery packs (mega packs and home battery storage) and it expects its energy business will be 50% of the profits of the automotive revenue in the future (so billions of $) 

Next era energy is also one that's investing into battery storage and has a good renewable energy diversity portfolio, I invested in this company, however I went full on to tesla because I just think its a better company and more growth will happen here.  However they do give out a dividend.

I’m not mad. I’m just disappointed.
Good longterm investment ngl
Yo I’m wondering this too. I’m keeping my puts for the eventual crash. Wtf is has to happen!
Doesnt matter, i got iron hands boyyyy 

Tendie cityyyy
You’re good bro
id love to imagine that one of these 10 upvotes is a hedge fund manager somewhere making his clients tendies off this sub. In reality all 10 are probably new traders under the age of 40 that trade through robinhood and have less than 50k in their portfolio.
Ok... now whats the counterargument before I yolo
market up on Biden's stimulus hopes
How much gay is the market? Very gay usually.

Best to BTFD cos we know a pump will happen for end of week

Gap-up on SPY at open.
#CUT THE SHIT
I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE
So, buy calls?
Me too but if it opens up only +2% thats an easy double down on calls lol
According to who?
$530 is my reasonable price target
Big green day for PLTR
imagine 

if

you

bought

calls
Nah you just quit after they give you the mortgage.
Good point. I meant homemade
I heard Elon Musk is taking a large stake in PLTR!!!!! Everyone buy!!!
You think its going to run more?
If you have Tesla you’re pumping. If you have BABA, you’re going to be BABANKRUPT.
This made me laugh
Fuck your gold, boomer. Shitcoin is the way
Ironically the reason stated for sfm LEAVING is what really pumps the stock for me. PLTR looks like it’s really good at what it does. SFM feels that this has negative social benefits on the world.
I can’t wait for palantir to get a government contract so they can look up me saying the word “retard” in 2018 and send me to a Kamala Harris re-education camp
[deleted]
there you are
I think those are just S&P funds buying Tesla because they have to buy it now that it will be included in December.
haha I rememebr that day, I got banned too. Unfortunately that account also got permabanned after that so now my burner is my main.
This will happen ^
I have to eat breakfast first, still got 30 minutes.
This isn't a creative writing class, you gay poor
This is amazing.
Come on DKNG give me a 30 minute pump at open
It's the future telling us where it'll end eod
imagine 

if

you

bought

calls
Keep [this](https://www.nowinstock.net/videogaming/consoles/sonyps5/) open on a tab all day too. It updates every few minutes. You might get lucky on PS Direct also. It shows at the bottom all previous stock changes and what time they happened too.

Fuck yeah
You know what the return policy is on consoles? is it 90 days?
What the fuck is ciic
After mangos Chyna announcement, if and when it happens. Going to hit baba hard, bargain prices will follow.
I don’t remember who it was but he called for it to hit 60K on CNBC. They all started laughing
I didn't even go in because ... Idk .... reasons
mr 9am didn't wish us a great day today 😢
Riot go brr
If TSLA doesn’t reach 500 by EOD, my account will be nuked :/
Your eyes. My ass.
Bump that to 12/18 19c
YOLO'd into CCL. I will either rise or sink with this literal ship.
Guarantee you’ll regret that.. BABA is going to rip so hard once an announcement comes out.. if you didn’t put it on the downtrend at $290 it’s too late.. gooo long!
Who would short on a Thursday to Friday run-up. This will tank Friday afternoon. I will be dropping a load on it tomorrow
half the people here can't even afford BABA, that's why everyone is talking about sub $50 EV stonks.
Kinda retarded IMO for you to think Nio will jump another 50% after being up 100% 


Thank you for the IV crush sooo glad I sold covered calls on this
After a major announcement? who would've thought bro  


who would've thought...
But where is the fun ? Martian alien gun makes me not hate it as much... 

Green or red laser bullets tho?
not till Feb the Min.
fuck that.  every other business needs to open at 9:30, waking up early is fucking torture for many people
Or you know some of us are in both
Maybe nothing to talk about.
Yes. They were.
Yeah $200 MAX gain if it goes to zero.  GLHF
PLTR I need you to carry me today bud
🌈
Gordon the gecko?
Shoulda held its been pumping since late October brother!
Bullish
They hating!
They jus wanna continue the hype. Love it
You mean Pelosi
No joke, this copypasta to me is the best sign someone is fucking dumb (except old people they just don’t know better). Gota be really retarded to think this would actually do anything.  
It’s like a key retard red flag
Any of the others worth investing in? Shares
God damn... good luck man but god damn...
Yes, buy at the top
my mom just calls me gay and a disappointment.
Would’ve thought the pre-market rally would be a lot higher
Let’s go dog

And close at 5?
i dont have enough fucking money to buy anything further out
>AMZN 

FTFY
Guhhh
[deleted]
Yea let me just lose money cause some retard said so 
Best tips ever 
Also buying stocks based off of speculation is about as much "investing" as buying options.
Lower gains less risk as it comes withs the territory, but pretty retarded to just dog on stocks for no reason.
I do both btw
Bond holders drove it down on purpose for debt exchange. Artificially low
Not saying all in, but its definitely one of the reasonabke probability plays just like the ohase 1 or whatev this sumner. It will deflate quickly just like last time. I wouldnt risk more than 2% of portfolio
The best part about investing is making steady gains for a few months so you decide totl treat yourself to something nice and the next day your portfolio plummets
So tsla puts were retarded :)
at this point I make more money off them burning down my property than I would buying shares.
Might be time for SOLO puts
46.... And counting
YY bounce successful. In at 78. Out at 84
They sound like shit.
It's very obviously a Super Soaker on Android
I held amat so long bc it tanked after I bought it. Made okay money but had to hold for like a year. Great company, idk if its blast off material imo

Sweet. Thanks man
Will be a boring day, do something else. Welcome!
Very obvious attempt at a pump, question is does it dump
Adding another 200 shares of FSR and CIIC at the bell. Bullish af
Ha Ha Ha
Come on FCEL let’s open green
Legend.... An autist that actually kept his word
Both
The market needs to start opening at 9:00.  What other business doesn't open until 9:30?
that's what I tell myself at night to fall asleep lol
I HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFULLY SPLENDID DAY AS WELL
Ouch
It is one of the 28 ZETA companies
probably hit 500 today..
today will be a Green Day for BABA
I think it was 12 and 3 PST
probably just a small pull-back.

Cause the Mods are gay 🐻’s and banned me that one day WSB hit our political stride. Guess a bunch of people got caught in the filter. That’s why they made separate discussion threads Election Day instead of massive banning people from the thread like communist cucks.

12/11 $2 puts on AMC at open. With COVID at an all time high and the holidays coming up with movie theaters taking a huge hit I think this prints money.
or they want non-margin leverage...?
I didn't check, don't care. I hate both these companies. Zoom is somehow replacing already established video conferencing companies because they're the new thing. It's a crap company. And bikes inside? That just seems so unnatural to me, go outside.

You really need to watch this scene so you can pick up the cockiness of the guy sitting opposite him. It’s an amazing scene, and a perfect fit for the meme above.
Holding 8 contracts now and I usually buy 1 at a time, but I think there was at least once that I bought 2. February expiration so thankfully I have a ton of time.
Just numbers on a screen.
Today is probably the day for those pedos in thetagang

Your third premise is extremely flawed, if the banks are loaning money against their "reserve", every reserve dollar the fed creates can inject 10 dollars into the actual economy.
God damn are we dumping or pumping today?! Shits killing me

I couldn’t watch that shit for more than 1 min. NASTY 🤮
Poots at open?
Thank you! What I have been feeling but could not put down in words. Just hope for a few more days to close and get out. There are so many indicators the top is in. Just today, the CIIG merger with Arrival. It’s sheer dogshit. An aerial of their ‘factory’ in Banbury UK shows NO cars in lot. Next door is an Amazon warehouse where you can see vans and cars. Arrival website is a joke. Several billion for this hype?   


Yet the retards screech reeee ! reee ! here.   


SMH
Well if they start they better actually pass a bill. Otherwise the can go blow their dads
Yea just CIIC. The other two are unit share and warrants.
Queue the scene where he fails the jump and gets snapped in half by the rope
Buy the Dip.

Bad jobs numbers mean BRRRRR

No, sold my shares though. Not a lot of room to make money with puts on a $5 stock.
None of this explains why the market came roaring back in April when the pandemic was at its worst
Who the Fuk said Stimmy was passing? Mitch aint doing shit.
You should’ve bought a week ago if you want leaps. Weeklies or monthlies is better for now
Yeah, trading sideways is something
why did you get banned for five weeks? lol
So SHOP is going to finally get off the mat today? Looks like poor BABA no longer has any company.

1. Soros is a rat, so who cares.
2. You seem to have zero idea what Palantir actually does and how it does it. Otherwise you'd be buying
Is that it, or is it that as you hang out here you get smarter and start to realize all those people who you thought knew what they were talking about are actually dumbasses

There is no indication that they actually have any traction in the fuel cell market other than their name. They don't even do the same sort of stuff PLUG does. As I understand it, their main revenue source is small form factor power plants that are effectively large natural gas batteries.

Institutional ownership is nearing 70% after just a few months after IPO. That, along with the share buyback, will likely lead to a small amount of shares still in the public float. 

Thing I'm most concerned about is their ability to grow their home origination purchase amount vs refinances. Then again, this company is under sound management. I'm in for 370 shares @ 23 and some change. Holding for years.

I cant fucking believe you typed all that just to be wrong. There will be a dip. Never a crash. Will not happen. People freak out and say March was a crash and 08 was a crash. No. Just dips. Unless the world is ending or there are zombies, stocks always go up, the U.S. is a powerhouse for making money. Always has been. Always will be.
Today, PLTR is going to be guiding a mother fuckin TSLA 🚀
In for 3300 shares at 9.10, out for 14.60. Will not be touching this for awhile. Good luck fellerz
Well here's a quick explanation -

Markets can be red or green. if it's red, it's because markets went aladeen; if it's green, it's because markets went aladeen. Savvy?
This is the way.

I can’t find the other story,  but there was an Asian investor toting Tesla around $87 by year end as well.  News like this made the stock pullback on bs reports and the media should go after them now.
You know he had to atleast once can you say you wouldnt?
Roku up premarket... that’s usually bullish but only if big news is reported like an analyst upgrade or deal completion. Otherwise I think it’s a little MM manipulation to get autists to buy calls

Tbh it's going to take some time to learn what plays to make. Research , study the stocks that you like, collaborate that with news/ articles / patterns etc for the best moves..

Best way to to filter this sub is "new". Dont take anyone's word on it. Do your own dd. I have gotten some good leads here before.. but with that said I have also landed on my face trusting someone else's word/research.

Super high chance I go full bear

No, most likely a restructure program where you can refinance student loans to lower int rates/the 10% of your income for 10-20 years thing

You gotta work on your jokes, Pancho.
It's bearish in certain sectors of the market, obviously not all. Trading is not black and white.
Scooters/motorcycles are the main mode of private transportation for most metropolitan cities in the world, especially in Asia. You only really need a car when going long (no pun intended) distances.

On top of that, all last mile/small delivery/courier services  use them.
Better than this tho. Soros invested in the company AND the worst thing they have to say about it is the potential negative social impact of the market it’s in.  
Not bad management, not debts, not a slowing market ... nope, worst thing about it is « it’s market is seen negatively ».  
Lol buy calls
Is CIIG another EV pump n dump?

The summer of TSLA was a sublime time.  Even the most FD of FD calls made money during those golden months.

“Hmmm I’d like to shout RIOT today n freak em all out!”
This is just a massive Bull trap from 2008.

Jk, btfd ffs.
9 months out from the initial claims hitting 7 million a week. Cumulative claims is nuts.

Not to mention our unemployment number is nonsense since how many people get dropped off a unemployment figures since they are now out of the workforce?
I would be a millionaire
I mean, I hope so. Truly have some bullish positions. I just think the market has been ignoring the state shutdowns. If any more start falling, it may not be a bloodbath but we definitely won’t be printing.
;)
same, was fine
PLTR 20C 11/20
FUCK YOU $BEKE
Crayon drawings mean nothing with a stock whose price is up 2,500% on the year. Technicals and nio don't mix. A lot of these new companies and technicals don't mix. You're better of taking a fat dab and just guessing if you're gunna try to use techs on companies like NIO and PLTR lol. Not trying to be a dick at all either, normally crayon drawings help. But not with these companies.
Low margin capital intensive business
Diaper tax eats up a chunk of that.
FCEL?
He’s just mad he was wrong. missed out on mad tendies and he’s trying to act like he’s not fuming inside

Funny you say that, if you check my posts you would see just how right I am. Either way options over your boomer shares. 100% increase in a stock would mean well over 1000% invrease in its option value. This is wsb not r/investing. Only reason u would get shares is to do theta gang, but since you are talking about 100% in the share value you mean to buy shares, so you must be a massive pussy afraid to do options
Everybody wants to downvote on emotions when I called the incoming red yesterday over virus talks not going well. For shame. Leave your feelings at the door.  Keep tendies.

We need it to blast off to 20$ 

That would be beautiful
Wyf is SPAC?
their app/marketing is on a next level. They monitor people's behavior and purchases and create specific deals that cater to an individual to entice them to come back. If you have a friend and they have the Starbucks app, open theirs and compare the deals with yours. It's different

I bought $7c 1/21 back in February. Up 1000% and holding, might sell soon to free up some cash.
maybe I wouldn't be annoyed if I knew you weren't playing with a $500 account and with shares you bore.
All SPACs have one of these against them. Ambulance chasers
Funny that’s what my broker recommended, just throw in 5G

Dude congrats 

One step at a time is what I tell myself
most undervoted comment of the day, at least for those who knows what happened.
I meant to buy SOLO & accidentally bought 1000 shares of SONO. SONO is up 20% premarket, this market is retarded.
Nope but people who give it “upgrades” are the same people who have hundreds of thousands of dollars in it
CLSK about to break yesterday’s high premarket.
18k right out of the gate is cheap. Will likely fall in price as it gets established. It’s also highly efficient and small. Perfect for densely populated cities in Southeast Asia and Latin America i would reckon. 

You could be right of course, that’s just the only way I can see them being successful
Ok question, ALL IN ON FCEL?!
PTLR give me your energy
Once the market opens a lot of money is going to flock into TSLA. The FOMOers will unite.
For pennies, always get rid while you can in my opinion
It's just greed imo -- or it was for me. I started trading at every opportunity rather than at the *right* opportunities.
And you’re surprised because normally being leveraged 10x is a very risk averse strategy, right?
Like I said, scooters are way more popular in Asia.  Maybe they don't want a scooter, but they can't afford a car.  Which means they'll actually buy the scooter.
Poor people don't move the market I guess.
So maybe buy puts if you think it's going to go down?
Guess who has solo calls
Come on, Jeff
It’s not in the s&p for another month

LOL yes I realized I have $200k in flow and outflow on a $15k account that's only up 10% this year. If I had just made smaller buys one or two days a week all year I would probably be WAY up. Definitely have learned to not over-tinker, I am not a day trader.

pfff.  try growing up in the days when the internet didn't exist.  it was hard a shit getting porn.  you always tried to go from 7-11 to 7-11 to try to trick the cashier into selling your playboy or a hustler, or to get your friend's older bro who was 18 or 19 to go in and buy you one. that or you watched the scrambled channel for SPICE TV in order to catch a random boob every 40 seconds.
Completely true
WTF I am leveraged 10x and this drop is killing me
TSLA outperforms market again?
Sometimes I feel like when people post DD claiming a stock will moon, skyrocket, etc... WSB takes that to mean it will go up at least 5% a day and literally never go down throughout the trading day for 3 months straight. Like just green candles only on a 1m chart every day for at least 3 months
Don't let the prices fool you. You can always "buy high sell low".
No. She should have told you to buy options instead.

Thank you! Also im fucking pissed I missed an entry point for TSLA yesterday cuz I was sleeping lol
I will continue to ask this: why FCEL?
9 months "out" from what?  The government keeps telling businesses they aren't allowed to operate and shutting down society.  From where I stand we are two days out from the most recent state-wide lockdown order in my state.

The federal reserve jacked up the stock market back to ATH, everything is great! Economy is stronger than ever! 

This is the result of corporate socialism, wtf do you expect? They bail out multibillion dollar companies with 0 fukken conditions on the bailout money, and then act all "surprised pikachu" when the bailed out companies lay people off like mad to make more money.
The negative social impact is already a matter in terms of investment decisions. It is not something to disregard.

First of all if you wait 30 minutes for a coffee you're severally autistic. Drive through lines are like 10% of what normal foot traffic is. Just visit r/starbucks and see what the employees are saying. The first time around they lost 30% of normal revenue, it's going right back there.

Just ridiculous how they lose a sizeable portion of their customers, office workers in cities, and people think they are a good buy. lmao

Honestly I was happy just when it broke $25. At this point I'm just along for the ride.

Mid term it's super undervalued and should go to $50.

If they actually start delivering orders as promised by next September and there's no huge issues I'd look for it to tick closer to $100.

It was running up all week so I was afraid I was buying calls at the top. Yesterday it soars. TF! You got balls. Good luck.
lol yeah, but because it was a screenshot.

Now thinking about it I could have zoomed in. So my fault.

Anyway, it is like a velociraptor.
I hope so
No don’t get too ahead of yourselves, remember that vaccines exist, so the market is unlikely to dump lower than Early November levels (back when the 🥭 😴 standoff was happening)
I’d wait for a small rally, roll the calls down to the 45. Price moves a lot more at that delta and you can let these bags go much sooner. Maybe even roll them out to Jan.
Maybe there will be more "stimulus talks are going well" soon?
because the trend was down.

That is why todays numbers are bad
If its red add, if its green hold

I fucking got out for a fat loss yesterday :(. Oh well, I bought TSLA right after and made it all back lmao. Wish I would have held longer but hey, what can you do?
A SPAC is a company that is publicly traded but doesn't do much other than have money. They seek out a private company to merge with and effectively take that private company public. 

CRSR is not a SPAC but sells lots of computer peripherals and hardware. It also has a strong presence in video game streaming. Computers are the future so do it.
May as well head off the inevitable, when those are standard issue when they control the world's governments
Ho your calls will care.
70 days? Lmao what were you in for?
Daily reminder I will fuck you up

40 in less than a month. Normally I'd say that's a huge stretch. But who knows
Yes they cost 3k and its basically the only product they offer. This company will go back to 20 as soon as we have anything else to do.
Serious question.

How is the weekly unemployment not a bigger talking point? We are almost 9 months out and our lowest weekly claims sit at 700k. 

That's legit insane.

its a publicly listed shell company so that another company can merge with it to go public.  that way you can avoid doing an IPO. 

SPACs have a very bad reputation. Because it allows companies to avoid traditional IPO checks, companies are often brought to market with terrible financials.  See what happened during the SPAC craze of the 00s.  People lost lots of money.
Imagine being this upset you didn’t have any
That’s the sad truth

Rocket will need to exceed expectations if they want share price to rise, but Rocket is in a terrible position, let me explain. 

Interest rates are the lowest in history and Rocket is making most of their earnings off of refinancing. The market knows this, these spectacular earnings are fully priced in. But What happens in 3+ years when interest rates have risen again? Rocket earnings plummet. The market also knows this, which is why the share price is so low today. You will need to get rosier forecasts for 3+ years out if you want to see a jump in price and I don’t see it happening any time soon. You are bagholding something that will trade sideways for the next 2 years.
Daily reminder to quit being a bitch. That is all, have a great day

IRS does not care if its self directed or managed.  IRS only cares if the funding stemmed from pre-tax 401k or post-tax 401k income.  I am not going to give a lesson of retirement taxation here, but the gist is...  he will have pay taxes when he distributes the income if it was pre tax.  Thats not a big of a deal as you think, because he won't be doing that until he retires and for relatively small chunks.

As far as his movements within the 401k account, it is neutral.  There is no taxation due.  Its in an account he can't touch.  There are a million exceptions to what I said, but that's basically it.

It could keep running and then i have to stay in my calls as a spread which im fine with. But if i can scalp my short legs on something im long term bullish on then i will

The entity that purchased the call you wrote still has it. If you buy to close the trade, the shares from the call you purchased will be assigned to the entity that holds the call you wrote, if that entity exercises the option.

I would say no way.

Sure they got into $SNOW but they did this trade cheap unlike the rest of the guys. Munger spoke against Musk's management style and their investment philosophy doesn't fit well with this trade.

I would say if Berkshire is buying they are either buying airlines again or buying AMC to as a cigar butt.

Of course, the latest PlayStation launch will help Sony show revenue and earnings growth, but the new console launch alone is not much of a reason to buy the stock.

That would be change of view.

Shit should've gotten calls on covid, went from 29 per 100k to 76 per 100k.
Yeah, like the moment you start to somewhat cherish the fact that some rationality is slowly coming back to markets, there is some new buzzword like a "internet of cars" word thrown out and market is back to crazy mode again. 

I love Tesla, but this valuation and the army of supporters (including clown analysts) who still have the audacity to justify the fair intrinsic valuation on their napkin calculations. It is rather frustrating. But what can you do, bubble is bubble is bubble, eh.

Thanks man. I’m definitely gonna do that once I close out these weeklies. Actually gonna withdraw some to pay down my car loan or boost up my boomer portfolio lol. Hope you’re getting tendies too. I appreciate you answering my question
Is CIIC just free money at this point?
You can do it!

If PLTR actually opens only +2% after the NR last night then thats the easiest "more calls on open" I've seen since the mongoloids on stocktwits started sucking off SPCE in January

PROFIT
It will last because all the ETF indexes that carry S&P have to buy TSLA now.
What happened
694.20 end of week. Rally until Elon is the president of the USA.
Lol. “A business model.” My retarded cousin that shits his pants has a business model as well but I’m not about to give him money.
I’ve been in the position since 10/01, this stock has bounced around all over. All signs pointed to undervalued, should smash through earnings and go to the high 40’s price targets as some analysts suggested. Walmart got a boost, Costco got a boost, Target got a boost after earnings. BJ’s pulls back?! Heading in to the holidays, possible second lockdown in the north east, doesn’t make sense to me. In the end, after 19 trades I managed to come out $77 richer...
Sure you did dummy 😂 enjoy the losses
Congrats on your 6 months! Can't wait till im able to say the same. I've already became wayyyy more productive than I usually am. I have an app that tracks how much money I would be saving by not drinking. It's crazy when you actually see the numbers on a screen.

Great work, its hard but gets much easier. Waking up without a hangover, clarity of thought, extra money to yolo and more time for productive stuff in you near future. I’m 6 months sober
I've been watching it since 4. Consider it a dip you slept through. There was a minor downgrade from JPM that got priced in briefly. It's is going to the 🌙
I mean we had 3 or 4 10% days after the stock split before the momentum got killed
All four of them have actual business models. If you want pump and dump, go buy GBTC or invest in cribtoe pump and dumps. These companies all sell a product

More than double revenue and stock pulls back. I haven't been doing BJs every earnings I see it do well and it goes up and now when I decide to do it. Earnings did well and it goes down.
Sell today at the peak and roll it into a new position for next week
Futures weak AF
alright, real talk, what do we See Tesla being by end of next week? how is this rally gonna last?
It posted monster earnings and has been consolidating since then, break out imminent. 

most chartists on WSB suck ass, but there are some excellent ones on FinTwit, and while charts don't tell the whole story, when they are done well, they can be v helpful.
Buy both. Baba for the money, and Tsla for the memes
Better hope for inflation or that debt is never gonna get paid off! Oh and good luck if you ever want to  increase the interest rate and stopping QE!

Very Nice play
No :-)
Fundamentally, what has changed in TSLA over the last 2 days aside from S&P inclusion? Nothing. You’re the retard, go fuck yourself

Because at any moment the Chinese government COULD just decide ''MINE'', and nationalize it, punish it, or otherwise fuck with it.  


Amazon is infinitely safer than BABA, that's why it's got a higher value.
What's the deal with CRSR like what do they actually do
That is more than enough to start out but be ready to lose all of it. The trick for trading is to let go of that money and expect it to be gone so that any amount saved is a good thing. Trade smaller to medium companies so that your options aren’t too far OTM. Can’t make money if your options had no chance to begin with.
6 months ago.
i agree lets do this
Yeah
Good call. I knew the risks and was willing to give it a go. I'd be several grand richer but it was a good learning experience.
hahaha ya its on my watchlist and it is up in pre-market. its the weakest one in the list. nice catch
Nah it’s goin bankrupt. Amazon killed it. Will never have to step inside a pharmacy again!!

conf call in french and i dont speak the lingo.....help!!!
Thanks, I get that all the time
If I write covered calls, someone buys them, then I close out the call by buying it back. Does that person still own them or did I just take them from him personally?
is crsr still worth getting in on? im thinking about a 40c for dec 18
By end of month yeah. Will be over 1k by end of year.
They have been shitting the whole week
This is fucking retarded. Most of these stocks are pump and dump and don’t create actual value.
Good luck, bud!
I use a drill?
Are we selling Tesla at open or big balling
It does actually. It's travelling back in time that's the problem.
Algos safe me, please. I won't join the resistance if you eventually take over, promise.
Not in any line it is written that it will work "so well", but okay.
How else do you drink it
Why are there Buffet buying $TSLA rumors going around
But imagine buying 15$ calls tho. That 50% profit will look like crap. You would be looking at minimum 200% in that case.  
This isn’t r/investing
What was the 5k to 50k a result of?
As soon as the option's bid/sell are updated and are flashing green and look consistent between different strikes, then you know the option orders have been updated. Sell whenever you see that. sometimes it is like 10 seconds, other times it can be a minute. 

ya smart of you to have the Dec calls. its the best feeling when you can lock in profit on one contract and still have another in the running. 

Congrats bro. Don't spend it all in one place! Also in the past, I've found after a big win like this, it is best to take a day or two off and not immediately get into another play. Just remain cautious and alert, don't let the enthusiasm make you lose your big wins.

 Beep Boop, I'm a bot. If I made an error or if you have any questions, my [creator](https://np.reddit.com/u/6b86b3ac03c167320d93) might check my messages.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.
Nothing can go wrong.
Don’t really expect them to change their minds. Soros isn’t always right.

I feel for you and almost myself diverted from investing due to ethics and questionable business model. But i was like screw this, i am in it for short term profit then with the gains might do something good like charity etc... Respect your decision, also its not like palantir is the latest stonk on the market wait for newer ones :D
I have SPG shares. It burns.

What is the target? When start selling?
I just got a tastyworks account approved, just gotta get it funded now!
20000 PLTR @ 9... you bailed on 200k+ that's got to hurt..
Till college bball starts getting cancelled, which is likely.
Can't wait for today or Friday EOD pump into tech as people realize they were too quick to rotate to others because we're going back into atleast a partial lockdown - into online use, MSFT teams and subscription again
Yupp lol now im not sure if i should sell or hold on. It had a great day yesterday and today is lookin hot
is crsr still worth getting in on? think about a 40c for dec 18
Its just a house. U still got your health.
Your logic is sound, just don’t hold your calls through earnings
Yeah, I think PS direct is better as long as you get in the queue early. Set an alert or chime on nowinstock and just have everything ready (be signed in, etc.).

LOL i was somewhat on board until VFF
Eh, that one already jumped like 100% in the past couple of days. I like these ones because they have more room to run up, at this point
You know they say hindsight is 50/50



, Or was it 69/420? Dunno, going all in on sométhing tomorrow
I was gonna do TSLA 11/20 calls but there was an error when I was trying to do it and decided maybe it was trying to save my money by fate. I hate myself so much for deciding not to do it. I’m smooth brain
Yup looking forward to the next earnings 3/19 100c
What are the plays off of this?
That’s what I’m saying.
I have 25c 11/20 psth. Hope it's worth something today!
Ahh shitty advice from a 3 month old account, who would’ve known?
Yeah, revenue is higher, margin is better, business is more diversified etc. But yet it trades at a discount even when it's not getting pummelled into the ground.

Why? I am not exactly certain but my long term outlook is that will change as BABA will only get bigger.

Most of the interesting startups in China have stakes owned by BABA or TCEHY including NIO and XPEV that have gotten a lot of hype.

I think people outside of China don't really grasp a) just how fucking big it is and b) how many markets they are in and doing well at.
I guess I’m just a psychic
Anyone still in SOLO?
Not sure how many vacinne pumps we can effectively have. There were already 2. Market going to be numb to this one imo.

But not in real states
This is the way.
Wanted to offload $34 mil yesterday but changed their mind?
>Yes it might not be huge gains but it is free money if you're holding the stock anyway.

Only because you're giving up on the upside of holding the stock, so it's not really free.
I'm iron condoring SPY a week out with $350 as the floor and $363 as the ceiling.

ES futures rallied to -0.03%, probably going to open green

I wonder when I’d be able to accidentally put in the share price of AMZN in the quantity
You are going to be okay. How far otm?

What I read is « this works so well it will have important negative social impact ».  
Clearly buy calls.  
The fact that it has negative social impact is absolutely irrelevant investment wise if you only care about profit.
Tsla putting all this cum in my pants.
Tesla rallying next week?

Meatball is going no where!
They’ve been going on for weeks now.
I’m riding Elon musks long boat straight to Valhalla today. TSLA 520 EOD
I do. Mid January 20 calls.
Bullish
they're an extremely popular peripheral and hardware company, they have a great reputation also. i don't know why i didn't buy any on monday
SPY and PLTR got that little 🍤 energy today
Thinking about plug 1/15 24c I like the company not sure how the offering is going to impact the price though. Thoughts?
I Aint ok! Help me out please!! What should i do? Buy tsla calls or sell my put or hold or whatttt???
Lolol idiot
ok which one of you retards are buying nkla because you think gm will announce their partnership today
S/o to whoever sniped my Tesla calls
Nearly half a trillion now and TSLA still has 10% daily moves. Looking forward to this SPY inclusion being so fucked up that it catapults Tesla into being the most valuable company for a day or week. Ultimately passive money will hold the bags.
He's using the boomer "I worked hard to get out of debt, fuck these millennials, Dems and libs bad" cliche
I paid off my student loans recently, but you bet your ass I'd vote to eliminate student loans. College is to fucking expensive for what you get.

Bullish for tech
You forgot to include the daddy: GBTC
PLTR
It’s all hype on the GM deal. May or may not be announced today. If not it’s dropping like a rock. I’m regarded and went all in 11/20 puts though so I’m fucked.
gayfag. Not our problem if you missed the train. It's still time to hop on. It won't go to 17. You know it, I know it, we all know it.  
With a Gov. contract like this, it can only go up  


See you on the moon!
Market is insane af..I wanna go cash gang but I don't want to miss all the tendies either.
Look at all those words! How can he be wrong!?!
They didn't change their minds in these 2 days,  and I got calls back when it was $10. Never said I am bearish on PLTR
Thanks brother, I appreciate that. I'm on ToS, so I'll wait until 932 eastern and then put in my order. I'm not sure where this is gonna go at open, but if it keeps mooning, I have some December calls so I won't miss out.
Why would anyone be selling before the inclusion you fucking moron. Let me guess, OH TSLA is up. 

People are so stupid, like legitimately, you are a fucking lemming.
I kept one and sold the rest Lol but i may go back in idk yet!
Yeah i don’t think anyone disputes this. Everyone wants the NEXT Tesla.

It’ll hit 500 today, it’s almost there
That’s my assumption. I’ve been holding shares and warrants. Saw it spike yesterday afternoon and covid into calls across different strikes and expirys

Hoping for an announcement
ban me i dare you
Niceeee congrats! I just wish I had had the capital like our fellow autist who’s now a millionaire partly in thanks to CRSR blowing up
Yes
Honestly the only good thing about RH is that you can't do shit that will put you into negative on it. 

Can't short, can't do naked options. Only way to end up negative is by basically breaking the app.
Come back here in an hour and a half and talk to me
If I want to off-load one contract at open and I am happy with where the price is, then I just place a limit order for what it is trading at. If you make a limit that is higher than it is trading than it might not fill and it might drop. And you'll be fucked. 

If you think it is going to hit a higher limit than what it is at open, then you clearly don't want to sell at open. 

If you want to sell at open, just sell at open...one word of caution--wait until the option prices update though because sometimes it takes a minute or two on TDA.

How do you guys approach selling stuff at open? Like how do you determine the limit price you want to put in? I want to sell one of my TSLA calls at open and let the other ride.

Options profit calc tells me that @ 495 contracts would be around $23.00 each. Should I just throw in something like $25 for a limit or go higher ($30-35) and hope it gets filled?

I locked in profit yesterday by selling the 480c 11/20. (I had a 475c). Going to close the profits on that spread at open and will buy any dip down to 480-485ish. But no FOMO. Chasing Tesla when it is above 500 is going to get someone hurt. 

Always other trades.

Agreed. Unless it rallies soon on some good news, there's a good chance it will drop below $10. I'm hoping the increased volume yesterday and 100,000 share block purchase is a sign that somebody has some extra insight and positive news is imminent.

It has been a real test of patience having this much money sitting on the sidelines.

Thank goodness I bought back one call into Tesla early yesterday morning. I’d be feeling the FOMO so hard right now. Wish I had kept my other calls though but oh well.
Ive been doing basically this but opening my call into a vertical instead with the short leg way otm. If I sell the short leg on a rally i can usually buy it back for a profit later and do that over and over. Its smaller money but im tired of massaging poorly planned calendar spreads

No news actually went down after the alert. I’m going to try to hop in at open today
It’s what we all do to his girl
This aged well. 🤡
Nov 27th $50 call? I need to makeup for this loss.
NIO gives and takes, it took your money, now you give it more.
Bank of America hold 27/11 55c calls
Always has been. Either that or the market does in fact go up and down
FCEL is back baby. To the moon!
Sounds like amzn and zoom investors more than anything else though 🤧
LMAO 500 by 8am
Yeah RH gives a 1,000 instant which is plenty for me because I’m a poor SOB.

Am considering switching to TD. I’ve heard some good things? Better charts? Quicker refreshes?
dont do options on them, its like picking which offbrand shitcoin will be the one.

Personally I think VFF shows promise but I havent done a whole lot of looking knto it
NVDA is fucked next year. Only salvation will be deal with ARM
Tesla is about to break 500, this is going to be a historic moment 🎉
SOROS -> SONO -> SOLO -> FOMO
Banned.
I genuinely believe this is the last time we’ll see TSLA under $500. Which is think is a fair valuation.
my dude what do you mean by "common"?  

*pls don't judge*
I wouldn't short it personally. There is a possiblity of $30 based on value of merging companies. Not saying it will make it to that number, but it could burn shorts if it stays up between 20-30

official TESLA AT 500 EOD TODAY upvote positive energy
He's still holding JCP.
Crunchyroll is a porn streaming service for zoomers
I'm hoping it retracts a bit today. Bill thinks a negative market correction is coming so i highly doubt he will announce yet. I will then go all in on it if it gets back under 24
[deleted]
Why tho
When Ma bends the knee, yes.
CCL isn't going down, is it? In spite of all the bad news, it's just going to climb isn't it? Retard buyers and mmers who are out of shape as shit and need hookers to get laid
If SQ reaches 200 by tomorrow i will be rich
Why is FCEL up?
NVDA free money, I'm going to keep buying shares at this price until i own the company
Tesla to the moon
[deleted]
NIO leaps
[deleted]
More nio of course
SQ calls and CIIC shares
Not the best song choice here
I’m dumb cuz i was looking at that yesterday too but did nothing.  Was there any news on it?  I liked it just cuz it was under 190.
Step up to a real trader like TD. Deposit on the spot and put in a position in less than 5 mins
Me. I have time to bring it back to 200$ tho
Sub-19 is what I look for. I got in at 18.66 last time. It dropped a little more after that. Got in at 17ish the time before that.  Do yeah, start looking for bottom once it drops to 19
GM using their technology
But this time I know and I’m getting in on the ground floor. It’s going to be different right?
Moves today to makeup for my $1,400 loss on $NIO?
Being a 🌈🐻 during a pandemic is morally unethical. 
They literally want covid cases to rise so their puts can print.
Yeah, people are just lying about it this morning. There’s no lockdown on deck...
For those that asked about options and ROTH IRA....I buy deep ITM calls (90 delta) over 365 days out and sells calls against them. I tried  to get 100 shares of DOCU but it kept moving higher making it harder to do.  Bought a 1/22 call and now I’m good to go.  Although I wrote a call to cover my cost just a few weeks out, and it already ripped through that strike.  GL bois.

RKT will have a lot of mortgages. People who don't care about their money will go with rocket because, "her's a queen," but RKT doesn't effectively tap the broker market. A broker can offer better rates at far lower fees. Where does that broker take the loan? United Wholesale Mortgage, a company with the best mortgage tech and the best pricing. UWM works exclusively with brokers and they don't do "wholetail" lending (offer wholesale to brokers only to steal that broker business by refinancing it with the retail division, whole-tail.)  UWM is going public through a spac and is currently GHIV. 

Position: GHIV 700 shares and this year I have sent 85% of my pipeline to UWM.
Agreed - I hope this person isn’t really putting their life savings on a stationary bike company
lmaooo. well, just start off with tapping ASMR. if you don't like that, listen to scratching ASMR. If that doesn't work, then listen to whispers ASMR. If all those don't work, just look at your red portfolio and should depress you enough to want to just sleep all day LOL.

There probably is stock market ASMR lmao!

What I've learned about a lot of the DD and plays here is - eval quick (other news, screeners, etc.), look at trend and volume, get in early, play for a quick 10%.

Seems to work ok.

Edit: I also think the idea of a quick play and then coming back during lull before merger is reasonable.

You buy a call a week before earnings. Volatility increases leading up to the earnings date because who knows what tf is gonna happen. You’ve made like 30% profit because price went up slightly but mainly because of the IV increase due to speculation on what COULD happen. Earnings date hits and it’s right on the button with what was expected. Ticker trades flat or maybe even goes up a little, but now there is no longer any speculation on what earnings are so IV falls hard and in turn your calls lose lots of money.

So there is buy to open(buying an option), sell to open(selling an option), buy to close(buying back an option you sold), sell to close(selling an option you bought). You need 100 shares to sell 1 option. So dkng for example. You buy 100 shares at 48ish for $4800. You then sell to option a call. Dkng 10/15/2021 50c are 13ish right now. 13/48*100=27%. If you have the patience to wait basically a year, you can get 27% increase right now. 1.27*135=171.4. Boom you are back to even and then some

I love when women trade. I think there is this stereotype that women don't know finances/money. I think my gf is getting very interested to learn that I'm making hundreds and sometimes a thousand a week on options. She talks about wanting to learn so hopefully she'll be on your level soon!

TL;DR - Way to go!

The big fraudsters are  organizations like Citron and yes, even JP Morgan is in on it.  Citron report comes out and Nio drops, but guess who was buying  LEAPS? I saw the Oi jump from zero to over 600 on multiple dates and strikes via sweeps.  Ironic now that JP Morgan is positioned they come out with a "upgrade" a much higher price target very close to the Leap strikes they bought.  Coincidence? I think not.

BALA CYNWYD – November 18, 2020 /Access Wire/ – Law office of Brodsky & Smith, LLC announces that it is investigating potential claims against the Board of Directors of CIIG Merger Corp. (“CIIG” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq – CIIC) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of federal and state law in connection with a merger agreement pursuant to which CIIG, a special purpose acquisition company, will combine with Arrival Ltd., (“Arrival”), an electric vehicle manufacturer, and result in Arrival becoming a publicly-listed company. Under the terms of the agreement, CIIG shareholders will retain ownership of only 7% of the combined company.

The investigation concerns whether the CIIG Board breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders by failing to conduct a fair process, including the dilution of ownership interest in the combined company.
Imagine not buying SQ at 175

no, might dip a bit but 20 is in sight forsure
Careful when the $10 floor is lifted. Can happen before merger is complete (you need to watch out for the redemption date)
Maybe because it'll take months to distribute with hundreds of thousands more Americans dying by then?

Absorbed into it but not the focus. Basically, i think it'll be more fun than a "legit" math class like stoch calc
It doesn’t even feel bad when you’re watching it from the outside. This is the way.
It was at $199 earlier this month.  That's why I bought the dip.  So yes, I do think it's going to 200 plus.

Meditation.  

Count your breaths.  1 in 2 out 3 in 4 out ... 10.  Then rinse, repeat.  

Also repeat this mantra:

" All is well, my life is not in danger".

Anxiety triggers survival instincts that are often associated with thinking that we are about to die.  By telling yourself and realizing that you are not in imminent danger, you are just a retard, can calm you down.

Do you think it’s going up more? Price target just got raised to $300 and bullish sweep for $195 11/27 too.

My Spy 11/27 calls might not print, change my mind 🤔
You're confusing me. 

You mean I gotta wait until they expire by end of day. No way NIO is going to go past $70 by today

yes.... IN A FEW YEARS!!!!!!
If TSLA can withstand the weekly Thursday dumps today, it will go to $569 soon 🚀
If you sell more calls they aren't covered. What if you're current covered calls print?
SQ gonna have huge day.  Up 1.5% premarket.
Odds on December government shutdown?
I’m happy churning out 1%/week on RKT CSPs. If I get assigned, it’s easy enough to sell CCs at the same strike until called away. This is a nice cash cow to milk until it shows some momentum.
Wait a few mins after open for the dip. Possible 10-15% disparity I bet.
Decent amount of shares and itm leaps in my trading account.
Anyone else in CIIC worried about this dip?
Nice
yes
Theres no dimension where DKNG isnt at $100 next year
can you ELI5 why lots of buying yesterday for the 500C pushes up TSLA's price today? I think it has something to do with the market makers having to cover their short or something? Thanks!

People will look back on RKT at this price range in a year and will be like “I’m a retard for not loading up”
If 50% growth in the last week, with 24% coming from the last day, means nothing to you. Then sure...someone on here was hyping that it would be a $30/share soon, so if you feel like gambling
God damnit I thought 25% was too high yesterday. Fuck.

Options are like home insurance. IV is the arsonist living next door. As long as hes there, your IV will be high and so will be your premium because theres a lot a risk in insuring your house.

Then when he gets arrested (IV crush) your premium goes down
Ciic definitely risky. It's a gamble as usual

I'm a dumbass. 

I sold covered calls on NIO 11/19 $70. 

That shit expires today. 

Do I have to wait until Monday to sell more covered calls on NIO or can  I sell more at open?
You guys are really gonna fall for the same shit with DKNG aren't you. Lol

Today is gonna be entertaining
Good for you but gain porn reminds me too much of gay porn. I’ll stick to my more comfortable loss porno’s
My call is for 50, expiring tomorrow. I think I might just take profits tbh
stop spamming
Damn they tricked us yesterday with the fake move to tech. Looks like boomer stocks will stay up.
CIIC seems like a pump and dump. CRSR still has room for growth based off revenue and market cap.
that's how I always see DKNG lmao
No way people don’t take profits this morning at open after yesterday’s gains + AH. Imo wait for the dip. If you look at yesterday’s trend, there were two small dips before growth. Probably expect a similar trend this morning.

Wrong.  I just ended my free 12month Verizon trial.  My son was barely on Disney+.  He loves Netflix shows like Camp kikiwaka, NinjaGo, BEYBLADE, boss baby, Pokémon, avatar.

[deleted]
Hahaha love it. Your portfolio mirrors mine in some ways. I have about 1500 pltr shares and have a small holding of BABA, a position I will keep building on. I am desperate to take profit on pltr (I got in at $9.50) but I swore to myself when I opened my position that I would never sell it. I sold all my nio shares yesterday at 45, which I had from 12. The other thing I sold yesterday which I am already regretting is half of my Amazon shares. I love Amazon and am hoping to time the market, and buying back in when it drops back to 3,000. (I will probably regret this, but at least I still have quite a few Amazon shares, so if I have miss timed this, well then I am still winning)
Morning lads. CRSR or CIIC today? 

I'm torn. Reckon they can hit 40 and 20 respectively but CIIC will sell off quickly when people take early profits and a real risk of getting caught holding on the way down.
Worth buying or are we late? Shares

 Beep Boop, I'm a bot. If I made an error or if you have any questions, my [creator](https://np.reddit.com/u/6b86b3ac03c167320d93) might check my messages.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.

What stock is that?
Not accurate. I’ve been eating gourmet tendies from nvda gains for 5 years.
The best time to buy PLTR is 1 month ago. The next best time to buy is now.
since then the share float has significantly decreased. 60~ then is 140~ now. 40 is achievable
CAN'T STOP THE PUMP

Thanks, this is not my entire portfolio. Its what im willing to sell. Not that my entire portfolio makes my case any better. 

The rest of my portfolio is 100 shares BABA, 1000 PLTR, 100 AMD and around 15k in vanguard global ETF. 

I was holding 1/3 in cash for a crash until a couple of weeks ago when i bought BABA and PLTR. 

Im actually thinking also of selling all of those up there. Firstly oil and NET to take profit and next maybe AAPL cause im tired of bag holding it.

Normie autist here, ive only bought and held Tsla for the last few years. Started with $50k initially and have since withdrawn all of that, so the $300k in my account is all profits. So excited for taxes next year.

Back in March my account hit $52k and I considered selling everything and getting out, it was a pretty big drop at the time. Glad I didn’t, Tsla has been pretty life changing, used some of the money to buy one. Thanks, Elon.

TESLA TWERKIN AGAIN TODAY
The percentages are so misleading and bad for the public. They’re over 90% if people wear masks and don’t go outside. 

But people are gonna think that once they have the vaccine they can pass around doobies with runny nose mfers and not worry about anything. Woops, now that shit is like 60% effective, if that.
Many options plays come off the table when you become the market for the position.

Its why Madoff was caught by the SEC guy, the SEC knew there was not enough volume for him to be churning 50 billion in option plays with 12% returns for decades by himself (you would need a massive team to spread out the cash into sooo many positions).
Has the prophecy come true
I don’t have many positions. I’m so retarded that usually only one or two of my positions is in the green, but I tend to hit big on one every now and again keeping my overall account in the green. Logically, I should be yoloing right? I mean, eventually I’ll hit it big right? Casino style?
I'd sell, pocket profit and feincest principle. Gains are gains.

I'm not confident enough in a quick turnaround to go heavy into calls. I have some 3/19/21 OTM calls but I did divest 25% of my portfolio to buy more RKT shares yesterday when it dipped below $22. I think it's just a place to put money and forget about it for a year or two.

Can’t go wrong with Tesla though

Um I was defending you calm your tits jackass
I came across similar data too: the biggest takeaway was that, honestly, in more cases than not, investing in a company at an ATH isn’t as dumb or risky of a move as it might initially sound.
Lol Nio was at $3.98 back then 🙃
So hang on to this FD is what you’re saying

This sounds sensationalist. Many of the big name ADRs are in compliance with the current US regulations and are audited by US accounting firms. They are also commonly incorporated in the Cayman Islands even though their principal place of business is China.

I won the lottery yesterday after the first 3 numbers but then magically the next ones turned against me. Rigged.
Over 70% of Americans have a current interest rate above 3.7% and justifiably should refinance. RKT makes their most money from refinances. 

It’s arguably being sold off while hedge funds build their positions at a lower price. No major institution that has bought into RKT has sold. To build off the buffet hypothesis, him and the CEO of RKT are good friends, and buffet sold off half his interest in competing lenders when RKT IPO’d. News of buffet being invested in it coupled with the buyback could send this soaring.

But why the fuck would he invest in NCLH? Out of all the stocks.. And why has he had this success if he randomly picked one at a time to invest in. I don´t but it. He gotta have some type of strategy he isn´t telling us about. Cant just jeopardize a fortune like that.

It’s ok to fall apart too. It’s good to let emotions out. It’s when you bottle them up that you have problems. I can’t imagine how horrid anything like that would be with covid on top of how tragic the situation already is.

Every time I have sold I have regretted it, I think that’s what buffet said and it hurts me so much that I have sold some things over the years.

I have shaved my portfolio in half. We are riding at ATH in a volatile market. https://www.morningstar.com/market-fair-value

Also your entire portfolio makes me nervous. Apple, fine not really moving. net, could easily suffer from profit taking and drop it back to 60. Oil is not my gambit, but oil in a recession is something I personally wouldn’t hold. 

I am all for green energy stocks, this is a buy the rumour sell the news and horrible to say but the valuation depends entirely on market sentiment and subject to swings.

My two cents
Imagine pricing Tesla with a P/E of 140 lol

> If you have bought shares, well, don't sell covered calls right now. Don’t! You will be missing dollars for the miniscule gains. 

This is garbage advice, the premiums are insane right now. You can sell a $22c monthly for like $1.15. That's 6% while still leaving yourself 22% room to run on the share price, and if you bought at a decent price lets you average your cost down in the event it does drop.

For people who want to get in, selling puts isn't bad but buying the shares and selling the covered calls is likely the better bet.

I agree.  George Soros is a scumbag pos
First. A short squeeze doesn't make a company worth more.

Second. History doesn't repeat itself otherwise Blockbuster would start renting DVDs again.

Gamestop is a fine stock. But to think that it'll hit the same price as it had during the last cycle is a bit unrealistic when they have fewer stores and digital sales is a greater share of business now.
Question: how would they benefit from low interest environment?
Edit another question: why did they have such a massive sell off? 

On first glance doesn’t seem too bad though
Yeah... my co-worker moans every morning about those HYLN bags she is still holding. I try to get her to set a trailing stop, but you know... kids. My exit was $54.

What goes up must come down. If not today then tomorrow. If not Monday then maybe never... Difficult to tell with CRSR and PLTR... Especially PLTR. I mean what do they actually do? How do they make money? Do they even make money? Is it built on children's tears? And if so what volume of tears is required to start a 33 billion dollar company? 

I might short both today with a limit at 50% of recent pump. Then buy the dip. Then again this will be entirely decided by my existing calls and if retarded bears stop choking the life out of EV's before they level up and piss off all the boomers with ICE company calls.

You’re not looking at it correctly but good luck. $10/share of $CIIC implies $5.4B valuation.
it's almost impressive how many times you can be wrong in a row

cheers mate

Did anybody really think TSLA was going negative today
Ok for real NET need you to rise from the ashes and make a good run today thanks.
I seriously feel like you're me right now. I started off with Redbull, but switched over to monster because at the time it became my second biggest monthly expense after rent (rent > redbull > food). Even the monsters though, were only about 160 mg. The craziest part though is the Reigns and Bangs, and the new monsters, taste soooo good.

Side note, if you haven't (you probably have) try the C4 energy drinks. They're my new favorite by a mile.

CRSR to 40 by today hopefully
Given the crazy rise on NKLA this week based off the recent showing up in the GM website I’m hoping they drop (naturally I bought some puts). 
I’m in on FSR which didn’t quite go the day I was hoping. 
Ended up selling my RIDE 11/20 20c for 0.3 last week only to see them pop this week.

Yeah I agree. Corona is the final nail in the coffin that made me stop actively coming here. It's all people from the front page that just post shitty memes. Pre 2018 WSB you could easily have proper discussions and find good stuff to invest in, and our memes were the mad lads making insane yolo's with 500k every other day.
With that I would already be retiring and dedicating to my hobbies.

Don't get it. Do you have insider info to do such rotations with meme stocks continuously?

Haha and somehow the reigns are way cheaper than all the older competitors. When I see people drinking Red Bull for energy im baffled bc it’s so expensive and they’re weak as fuck.
Lol if you think I'm selling this any time before it hits $40, you sir are mistaken. That's without a short squeeze. If it's clear that a squeeze is happening, I'm holding till $100. That, or until Burry or Cohen sell off. Then I'm out and would suggest everyone else do the same.

I come to realize that this forum makes you lose money. This forum is bad luck. NIO i lost 400% profit because people that no nothing are telling to sell so sold it for small profit. ATt I lost 100%+ profit because of the same. BA I could have make 100%+ but sold it for a loss. Bought a little bit more yesterday during the high sold it for a quick small profit, could have smoke it. Is 6:30am eastern time & I could definitely say 99.9% on this forum know nothing like how Jim Cramer said. But look at still coming back. AUTISM is Real.

Lol get out of here. You’re bleeding money on your calls and want to net even.
Bitch I don’t remember him asking your favorite sex positions. 

What are your FINANCIAL positions. And yes that means specifics.
NKLA has a lot of room to run. I'm in both. NIO is going to consolidate at some level before its next move up. Not everyone has the money to sit in one stock in an industry where all the other stocks are popping too. I'm sure a lot of people are hoping to catch a 20-50% ride on the next EV stock that's going to move up this week and are not yet settled into their long term hold positions (if any). But to catch the entire EV inflows, you have to have to sit in at least 4 stocks at the same time, or you're only catching part of the gains part of the time.
Buy something longer than 3DTE then idiot.

It stands for financial derivatives
Check the volume on all the big indices, this dip isnt being bought
It seems pretty meme-like so it should be good for a run up to $18-$20 I’d think.

I want to dip out and buy PLTR weeklies but I'm a 🌈
It’ll rally back up! We in it for the long term!

Selling 22.5 puts is free money
If someone was gonna crash the market i wouldn’t be surprised if they did it 😂 weirrrrdo vibes
sticky ?
Just buy $200 of stock. You could do worse. CRSR still has potential to double and you will want high volatility if you only have $200. You are not losing your investment on CRSR. It may trace back a bit but you still have potential for 100% gains in a 2 year, possibly much less, time frame.
you are welcome
Another reason:

So you can dump your bags.

> Then updating my neuralink with starlink lol. 

I'm not sure this part will be a thing for quite a while if ever, unless you mean very indirectly like downloading an update over Starlink to your computer or phone (or car) and then patching your neuralink from that larger device over Bluetooth or something similar.

Directly adding a satellite receiver to a neuralink would add quite a bit of heft to the device (not mention that's how you get coronavirus).

As long as you're willing to lose the 200 just go for it, we all have to start somewhere. I am poor and have a small account, options are a good rush and made me feel alive especially in the beginning (the first one is free). I do think that with a small account it's easy to lose money if you're like me and get baited into cheap OTM close to expiry options. Now I'm even more of a poor.

I already like their partnerships and moves.  I'm waiting for the first big big acquisition.  They have billions of cash on hand so it's not like I have to worry about them going anywhere.

So was there a specific reason that CRSR mooned so much this week?
[deleted]
There’s a lot to unpack here...


First of all, do you live in Tony Stark’s house? 


Secondly, we need to work on your cutting skills.


Thirdly, did you ask for permission to cook and feed your dick to that dog? Might want to check that you wife’s bf is okay with it.
Funny, but not enough rollercoaster peaks reflecting the +900% gains followed by a -99% dip and back to -80 % loss

Nobody knows this, but it's actually your commission-free broker taking the other to side of your trade.
It is a SPAC - Special Purpose Acquisition Company. They announced months ago that HCAC is acquiring Canoo, an EV manufacturer in California. The merger must be completed by 12/31; once complete the ticker symbol switches to CNOO.

I mean...no more so than any other commentary I've offered before. A bunch of people are chucking money at CIIC. Pre-market price today is $15.40, a week ago today it closed at $10.15. Arrival (CIIC's merger target) and Canoo have a similar product, are both targeting B2B last mile delivery and both have a relationship with Hyundai/Kia.

Wtf is this  garbage? This guy definitely sucked off the mods to get his shitty DD post pinned.
It's not over

> Bank of America boosted its price objective on Nio (NIO -3.4%) to $54.70 from $23 as it swatted away any concerns over valuation following the Q3 earnings report. Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan raised their price targets to $50 and Credit Suisse topped the Street with a fresh PT of $60.

NIO is currently trading at $44-$45. So we're looking at 10% upside minimum and 33% upside maximum, based on analyst target prices alone and everyone knows they are always behind the curve
Tdoc stock good for long term too
same
Take your money and leave!!!!
people will go nuts if it's Stripe. But I have a feeling it won't be.  

Anyway "only 25%" downplays a bit what how much a 25% loss hurts. A lots of people are all-in into this. Don't forget this is mostly a stock play, so just putting in a few grand is not going to take too far.
Whatcha holding?

You live and you learn I guess. Easier for me to say! I’m learning every day. Trying to anyways then I make the same mistake. D’oh! 

What would you do differently, anything? Or was it unavoidable..?
I don’t know why they did that. The company’s a startup with no revenue but that’s ok because these days no-one who’s not a gay boomer cares so there was absolutely no need to pretend that they had a working prototype. It was retarded, Trevor just got greedy. It wasn’t even an intentional pump n dump because he never sold his stake

Why do you think they would go to 0? Sure your value goes down, but I feel like this "comback" could be a gain short term
I'm tired of This kangaroo market scam!!
WTF is this "company"? It literally does nothing.
Which WSB autist buys a VW? That's like responsible dad type cars.
That’s some pussy shit all in TSLA has better returns than that boomer portfolio
I don't know, just going into sectors for the sake of it rather than choosing companies seems like gambling to me.

They may be finalizing merger soon then finally. Good for my warrants
Could’ve had 17k instead at 12k for selling early :/
Right now is literally the best moment for getting a big boy tech job as some big tech companies are ramping up their remote force, hint hint. It helps if you have some experience on your resume.

Sir this is Stocktwits.
Haha used to be addicted to adderal and used it as a replacement. More addicted to caffeine than anything I’ve ever done at this point but yeah I’ve managed to go down to under 600 mg. My pre works end up being around 140 mg per water bottle and I drink 4 a day when I work.
Fair point. I thought PTON was overpriced at 60...  that said, NIO will eventually get punished. She’s been a dirty girl.
Exactly. That's the problem with the YOLO system. You have to hit every time, one loss can be completely catastrophic.
LMAO they’ve gone down $40+ this week alone. $19 down yesterday alone and a month ago everyone was praising this to the moon. it’s dead now
Freedom before portfolio loss! The day I have to wear a mask and Disney can't release the latest Marvel film for AMC to show is the day communism wins!! Planet fitness depends on it!

The companies need our tax bailouts and we must stay brave ans continue providing them profits! Freedom before virus!!
My routine is two 140mg energy drinks in the morning and a big diet soda during or after lunch. Watch out for Rockstars, the "juice-like" 10 cal ones I have contain 140mg but the diet regular ones have 240! Those literally make me uncomfortablely caffeinated, even just one.

That moment a minute before close yesterday....

We're right to hold. Faith.
Something is going on with [HCAC,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HCAC) soon to be CNOO (Canoo). It was up yesterday, including slightly after hours, and is up over 2% pre-market this morning. I've been bag holding 2,200 shares since August, waiting for some momentum, so I look at this thing daily.

Canoo management is presenting today at 4:05 EST at the [Barclays Global Automotive Conference](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-company-canoo-to-present-at-the-barclays-global-automotive-conference-301172289.html?fbclid=IwAR3IvQ3ZRE-3skXW1VAjJeSqvKgKGvOCK807rNjZvluDgIIbQhLbOmHKiZo). Yesterday before lunch somebody bought a 100,000 share block at $10.38 (smells like insider trading) and there was much more volume than there has been in a long time. It is currently trading at $10.37, and the largest open interest on options are $12.50 and $15.00 calls with close-in expiry dates.

Anyway, we'll see, but feels like something is afoot, and now is a good time to get in if you're inclined.
Was in Thailand for a while. Backpacking and not bum bum for money holiday. It was so nice to experience the women there. Very female and in general very happy people even though they do not have that much. My theory is that they remain more female than woman in western cultures for some reason. Tinder girls show how it works here.
at the end of the day, you gotta see what type of girl she is, be forward but not too forward. just depends on her vibe tbh, if she wants to fuck you then she will but best of luck to you
Why don't people have the same sentiment about MSFT that they have for ZM? MSFT's moat covers so much including video conferencing.
My fellow retard, I like the way you think.... what goes right must go left.

Used to be between 900-1200 when I was working 12+ hour days.
15-30*
They just want Coke
I’ve spoken to a few like that before. An in my conclusion I feel like you just gotta get to the point. Some just don’t like small talk and wants some action. I’ve tried the fast approach too and we met up like an hour after. 🤫
Lol “long term”, never heard of her
This is exactly what I expect of a combination of Chinese social media, and (Inter)National Public Radio.
Don’t try talking, just legit as if she wanna fuck. It’s tinder

Fuck you!

I was making a joke in saying that CCL is a bubble when in reality its trading well below its 52 week high. Point being that it’s stupidly resilient in PM right now and should drop in the next week. Play is $17p 12/4
It's TSLA

Energy. I used to drink 4 5 hours a day then moved on to 3-4 bang/reigns a day. Finally cut back when I moved to basically a pre work our mix I put in water.
the option I currently own is a leap to april i think
Are you a fucking ostrich, cause last I checked they were the only species to stick their head in the sand. I mean, mass looting, riots, racial violence and unrest, political scandals, massive fucken plague... take your pick, anyone of those outdoes a bunch of hippies screaming about Vietnam.
Thanks br0, may the autism and tard strength keep you strong! 🤣
What's up with these no-value hindsight bias posts. You missed TSLA S&P inclusion pump, you missed PLTR, you missed NIO pump and dump, you missed RIOT pump and dump, you missed SPY post election ATH and you missed SPY to 218 in March. Either time travel or just fomo all in yolo style at market open into crsr and cross your fingers

And I’ll bet my left testicle on it that way OP has a set of nuts to choke on if we get down there.
I can't believe how fast consensus changes on here. 2 days ago it was NIO and PLTR to the moon and now it's supposed to be worth $0. 

Do you all really only buy weeklies?
Wrong sub, we do gambling here only, not diversification.
We are down from 362 to 355 within 24hrs

I have puts , but I think this shit gonna stay sideways and pump EOD to 360 

This isn't red enough
Please market for godsakes stay red until open so I can offload these puts for a profit
Please be JD and PDD so BABA moons

I don’t get some Tinder girls. 

We match at 3am, I ask whats up/how r u- she says good - I tell her I just woke 

She says haha cool haha she cant sleep

I say I get that, im up late a lot too - ask if she had a late coffee 

No response for an hour, unmatches me...

Wtf was the issue? Did she expect me to slide thru or invite her over at 330am? Don’t get it

That was a cakewalk compared to today. Information alone travels so much faster and into so many avenues that the inherent complexity out does Nam by an extraordinary magnitude.

They acknowledge that they don't actually deal in the data but create the software that links data together so I don't really see this as a concern.

100 shares of AAPL (worth 11700) - currently at a 600$ loss

100 shares of NET (worth around 6500) - currently at 1200$ profit

500 shares of an oil ETF (worth around 13k) at profit 1600$

1000 shares of INRG (similar to ICLN - worth 12.3k) at profit 300$
You keep believing that brother

I need to dig in a little deeper on them to see what I am missing. I see a meme stock at the moment.
Very bullish on them as well and have actually thought about your idea myself. Have to say that I have seen a significant increase of Niu scooters in Europe the let few months. Let’s see what earnings will tell us monday. Eventhough the fundamentals are great, the stock price movement is hard to understand and I feel most often not really justified.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.

Got in early on IPO. I think the biggest thing is that they own Elgato and pretty much every content creator on twitch lives by their streaming products. They also bought out Scuf gaming so all these controller fucks on fortnite/COD that are also building new PCs for Christmas will drive this up as well.
This is a big pump and dump.
I thought i read somewhere that after their recent earnings that they would have been profitable if they didn't have to put up the cost for their own direct listing?

Anyone else tired of the absurd amount of sheer lies and bullshit here? Happen to know that one of the posts that was high up on the popularity scale yesterday cannot be true. Just a quick search of users profile tells you all you need to know.   


Virtually 100% of the outrageous gain porn is fabricated. There are a handful that ring true. These are long standing, DD filled plays that check out historically. Even some of the losses are BS. Well remember some kid who posted here once, said he lost £64 000 in a ‘funny story’. Never seen again and profile is of security guard like 20 yrs old, weird other sex fetish stuff.

You should look into why they arnt profitable when looking on paper.
You’re gucci. Big truss
I think the higher volume is because Pershing has Q3 earnings call today, I fully expect to lose all of my gains tomorrow. Currently holding 4k shares
Yep
You mean bleed?
It looks like this was a prax air merger and prax was the king basically. With the issues with refrigeration of the vaccine coming this could potentially pop heavily again or jump and set a new level. Kinda wild that I slept or missed this angle of things.
Oh No, It's Retarded
Does we know when CIIC Merge ? 1 month after SPARC (yesterday) but surely cant know when its the exact day?
Lol they can’t agree to keep the government funded. Also, they’re currently in recess till 11/30.
I know "fundamentals" arent very popular here. But look at the last 20 years of airline performance. They all tend to have around 0% ROIC. or just look at the ≈ 0% net margins. or actually any margin. maybe because its a competive industry with commodity product, which also happens to be quite capital intensive. Why would anyone really put their money there? The stock prices can go up and down, but they not going to create any value for equity investors unless you play the stock price.
PLTR has never been profitable since day 1 for its past 17 years of existence. It is unsustainable and investors are just playing musical chairs with each other's money.
Make like a tree and get outta here.

You have to have a mission and carry out a vision. My vision is to invest everything I have, including my mortgage, into this stock market. I’ve given up everything, my wife, my family, no one means anything to me anymore. The benjies talk to me at night. They soothe me. They comfort me. It’s all I need.

Trying to get myself ready to go back to work since I was off for 5 days from having a covid test, came back negative so I go back in 2 hours. Trying to decide if I want a shower before leaving or another hour of sleep before I go in.
I bought puts yesterday morning because last time in late spring it hit 230 it bled out to 170 , granted diffferent circumstances this time around but I dont see ba being profitable for a while, I can see it pumping again so dont panic, maybe average down
probably worth 0.1 at open tomorrow

why is SPY down
All papa Elon needs to do is announce a stock split and the stock will double.
Ah shit, a purple nurple glizzy gobbler trend is forming right now, this is gonna be an interesting day
I'm buying. Not substantially, but it's hit an obvious floor and liable to pop for 20% any day. Think GM's angle on capitalization and market sector is what draws this kind of price action.

The div is payed out to owners at midnight (actual pay 30 days later) and the stock MMs cut the price by 56 cents in PM

It then opened slightly up and then sold off over the day.

The div is on 1% per year and an exdiv like that barely messes with the stock price.

Anyhow, anyone selling it on Tuesday still gets their 56 cents

It was to anyone who did some DD on them. May - June 2015 was when I was planning to switch jobs in tech and was looking at pre-IPO companies (did end up joining one but it got bought out instead of going IPO). At that time, Theranos was hot shit. Glassdoor reviews wre good and Blind app didn't exist for people to know how it is like working there.  
  
Then, I stumbled across this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9440595  
  
Some more DD from other comments on articles by people actually in that space convinced me to stay away from it. A few months later, the WSJ article broke and brought down the house of cards.

Was theranos actually obvious? Serious question.
I ran my optimizer for the case that SUMO will end up somewhere around $23 on 12/18. Here is the most profitable strategy in that case:

* Buy $2.5 calls for max. $1680
* Sell $25 calls for min. $300
* Sell $25 puts for min. $620

In total, it will cost you $1030 to enter this trade, you will profit as long as SUMO is above $18.90 on 12/18. The expected profit in the case that SUMO ends up around $23 with a wide tail distribution is $802, the max profit of $1220 is reached at $25.

This is obviously a very ballsy play as the losses sum up quickly if SUMO ends up below $18.90. If you want to test the optimizer with different parameters and / or limited maximum losses, give it a try over at [https://velistos.com](https://velistos.com)

Wouldn’t they issue new shares ?
They are at the final stage of exiting bankruptcy, expected they will get out of it by the end of november.

There will be a change in ownership, the plan doesn't look solid but it's worth it for me to risk. Due to the huge layoffs in july they are taking a few steps back, which is a good thing. One step back, two steps ahead

Idk who the fuck thought this week would be bullish, with so much bad news and uncertainly looming and not priced in.
They exist as a form of hedging a stock portfolio - insurance.

Its so people who own shares of stock can offload some of the risk of their investment.  
On the other side of the trade, it's so people who don't own the shares covered by the option can purchase the shares in question at a reduced expense, thereby increasing the value of their portfolios.

So on one side you have people with shares trying offset the risk of volatility, and on the other side of the trade you have people trying to get a better deal on a stock they want.

Then you have people, like this entire subreddit, who use this system to gamble because they can't afford a Friday night at a casino.

It's less general purpose than the Unreal engine (which is good enough for use in movies - for instance its use in the Mandalorian Disney series) so it's usage outside of games is more limited.

That said when it comes to entry level engines Unity is king.

They have the government’s new national renewables energy goals on their ass now.
Apparently market is very forward looking, aka FOMO

Ban this retard - only honest autists belong in here
Low volume fat fingered
Close, on the prospectus they state the banks get a percentage commission on what they sell and also the opportunity to purchase shares at the offering price, so they pump up expectations before the offering and then give a new price target usually the week after. If you want a specific example look at Jefferies actions on the Audiocodes newswire. The exact same playbook happened for Nio with the $17 offer. Look into it more I only noticed it after the fact and didn't think of using it as an indicator
ive heard cbd can counteract being too high
I’m still lucky at this point not being down in such a strange and complicated market if anything. Yeah it was an emotionally charged move, my first time ever buying options, but whatever I turned pizza money into a hotel for a couple of my friends families. 

Basically though my point was making the fully retarded short play, with insider information of the fire outside my door, PG&E’s plummet barely does a thing for me when all I had to throw at it was the pizza money in my PayPal
You win fellow 🤡 🤡
Some were right, alot were wrong and even more were just early and paper handed. Been and wild ride since late February when I started trading again. Had I been on some other forums and twitter I might have made a crap load AND kept it. Actually pretty dead even at this point but instead of starting fresh with capital I'm starting with my own table scraps next to this MOUND of shares that managed to keep value during all this and a handful of what we're leaps in Feb but now expire in Jan and are ranging from -45% to -88%. Would have rolled them out but to many contracts were bought during the DCA days and I just have to hope now.

Best wishes to ya brother!

Take a seal, I laughed.

It just keeps going down lol
When I'm bullish, I usually sell wayyyy OTM calls (like the 10c level ones)
I’m donating $500 to a homeless shelter in my neighborhood because I prayed for SPY to crash and God answers my prayers so I am going to do a good deed 😌
lol, sure. it's just chilling and waiting for showtime to shine
Why
All hail nio
Go big or go home. 

If your calls are green, you're not out of the money enough. 😎
E. All of the above.

That's expected profitability in half the time since IPO'd compared to Tesla. Very impressive.
I know. I'm being sarcastic. Nothing makes sense right now. More cases, more deaths, Boeing and cruise stock up 30%. 

Then again, this entire 2020 has been, more stimulus, more Corona, "market rallies to new highs!". So maybe it does make sense. I dunno. Just pick your favorite acronym and load up on calls.
True but this is a given, looking for something more concrete
no. give it time to go to -3% first.

You're a good man. She's lucky to have you.

I got a theory. Hear me out retards. Now that NIO is out of the spot light after ER, best EV, tech etc etc everyone is focusing on the next MOON aka PLTR because retards. Me thinks MMs, algos, your mom and her bf tried to manipulate NIO because they missed out on LI and XPEV moons and saw the same shit would happen with NEO hence Shitron Left came out with negative shit to try to get in on the cheap cheap.

Lol
TSLA not as bad as I thought it would be
FCEL, solo or SBE?
I'm not saying it's perfect, but when Bank of America or Morgan Stanley raises a price target on something when others aren't, it's been an indicator of an offering they are underwriting. NIO and Audiocodes comes to mind, but there's been several this year

I think this is too bearish. Tsla was already making out with 496 yesterday. Definitely going to 550 or 600. Word on the street is Buffett is ditching BYD for TSLA
There will likely be a sell off after that date and you might not be able to sell them for any profits as the stock price might come down to much and eat all your gains. 
You might have to hold a little bit to sell.

you know you can do both right? I'm 70% ETF 30% options. don't need to go full retards
1% is being generous
The question is growth, and the future value of earnings. Amazon is viewed as the most scalable company out there and when it chooses to make apple level earnings it can do it. As for value- are you not looking at all, there is tons of value in this “bubble” just not in the sectors you are looking at (eg tech)
I tell myself that every morning.

If you don't mind the possibility of going slightly red, which could happen this week, but probably won't go below 15, I would hold onto this one and average your position. PLTR is securing government contracts. Their price is going to steadily go up over the next few months.

When you're trading options all day long, your heart rate goes up, you lose alot of minerals and vitamins get dehydrated, so you get an iv bag and a syringe, stick it in your vein and then crush the iv bag, its going to give you a rush that will make you buy and sell options way faster

Cocaine has the ability to convince the user they are profound, but, unfortunately, when the effects wane and the supply is gone, that same user will be forced to confront their mediocrity and reliance on cliches.

Oops, meant good. Edited
It might be really autistic but it seems that PLTR is consistently seeing a high peak midday and troughs with a moderate gain from yesterday at close. 

Is it worth selling my holdings (81 shares, @ $17.27) at what I imagine to be today's peak (say $19.25m of course big chance I'm wrong) and then buying when it falls down to say $18.20?

Fairly new to this so forgive my retardation

25 by mid-December, will crash a bit early January because employees will be allowed to sell part of their stonks,  then will rise again to 30+ by February when Q4 results get released.

After that point, institution funds will start to poor in cash massively, dumb money will follow soon after.

I would say 80$ per stonk by end of 2021

Methane is combustible. Our farts contain methane. If we could capture everyone's farts, we could built this alternative source of energy. Farts are free too. You could also give people fart credits to produce more.

I mean once you know the make and model you want it’s just a matter of finding the best deal. I bought my last car sight unseen and had it delivered and it was glorious. I emailed the dealer with an offer from a different dealer, asked them to beat it and they called me five minutes later and were like “okay let’s do it.” I kind of feel sorry for the dealers tbh. Never buying a new car in person ever again

Sounds like you're very young and still have plenty of time to learn even more about the stock market and life in general. Sorry to hear about your situation, the CA fires affected everyone living there not just you. The system is not rigged, sounds like you were purely playing options which imo only more experienced individuals should be doing or highly leveraged people should be doing or both. You were a victim of circumstances and poor decision taking within the stock market and not managing risks. You live and you learn. Hopefully this experience makes you wiser in the market and in life in general and not a quitter.
I avoid TSLA because I don’t see how it can’t crash as easily as it rose. But I’m not a securities analyst and have no competency to say that I’m right that it might crash

yes! yes!
 Well, ofcourse, issueing additional shares is a viable option. Yet PLUG could borrow or get money from th early investors. I would suggest to research debt financing options rather than dilution because the "smaller" retail investor can be overruled/taken advantage of by shareholders who own sizeable chunks of shares.. i know lot of the robin hoods are in and out but for the long term holders.. dilution is second choice *imo*

Naw he made money on it. Bought 20m at $26.94 and 3 months later sold 12m at $28.11. So he does have a bit left. And by "A bit left", I mean a couple million more shares than I do lol.

30% of their revenue is from Peloton which is... a lot:

> Our top merchant partner, Peloton, represented approximately 28% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and 30% of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Our top ten merchants in the aggregate represented approximately 35% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and approximately 37% of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020.”
> 
> “For example, the significance of Peloton in our portfolio has increased as a result of consumer spending trends on home fitness equipment, and there can be no assurance that such trends will continue or that the levels of total revenue and merchant network revenue that we generate from Peloton will continue. The loss of Peloton as a merchant partner, or the loss of any other significant merchant relationships, would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. In addition, an anticipated material modification in the merchant agreement with a significant merchant partner could affect the results of our operations, financial condition, and future prospects.”

That being said, Peloton is all prime borrowers taking 0% APR deals: good for $PTON who gets to realize revenue immediately, and good for Affirm that gets to stack quality vintage on to their books.

what he did is not that risky. The downside is only 15% if the deal blows completely and the trust dissolves, and the upside is 100-200% depending on the target and how much FOMO that will generate in the short-term. I think it's more of a matter if you are willing to let the cash sit for possibly many months.
Now that they have identified themselves, Palantir can keep track of them.

go to r/options r/thetagang. learn about the prople on the other side of the WSB street who sell us the calls and puts. but for the love of God, do not sell naked calls and puts, always make them cash secured or covered. the one advice I can give you lol.
most brokerages will let you sell options when cash secured, you need special approval for naked sells, and you are better off without it.

You should read Andy’s statements vs what the company has done lately, he’s openly admitted he’s fucked up in the past in terms of unrealistic expectations.

So ppl aren't going to buy the dip on a stock that went down 20% because it was not included in the S&P 500, but now is... and the S&P hasn't even purchased their shares yet - meanwhile, longtime bear Adam Jonas turns bull and upgrades TSLA to 540.

soros and that other guy sold pltr because it’s associated with conservatives. i hope it moons to 100 just to cuck them.
But think about what you're saying. Inclusion is "priced in" but they haven't bought the shares. So you're saying the news is valid for 1 big day? Meanwhile, EV shares with no-name companies go up 100% a month? .... I give up

Whats nio sitting at now ?
my original drawing is still quite close to where we're at currently actually
buy the rumor sell the news... well vaccines are here lol
Soros is shorting it like Citron did with nio, just trying to be sneaky about it. He wouldn't say a word without it making him or someone close money. He either has puts/told someone to get puts and they just cashed out or they are squeezing and gunna buy back in later. There's always another motive when there's big money involved. Gotta think outside of the box a little
As long as we print our own money and hand out gov't contracts left and right I'd never worry about it. The concept of one jenga piece taking down the tower is not a new one. The beauty of most American funds is that we take out the bad pieces and replace them with stronger ones. You would need the kind of news like "we proved widespread accounting fraud and all the numbers are faked in over half the fund" because one is simply not enough to take the rest with it.  TSLA joining the S&P will be more beneficial than not if that was your concern
do it you either make bank or go down a legend

bulls are about to feel what bears have felt the last couple of months... all of the good news in the world and market is just gonna keep drilling
I mean it ran up 25% after hours yesterday, so I guess its pretty likely that itll open pretty red and then recover over the next days. On the other hand, as the news spreads more, it might just make another bull run right at open, who knows
Well it's too early to tell but I grabbed a small position at 11,850. The last time we had a serious drop I just kept buying every 200-point dip and rode it out. This market is rigged as hell and so far always pops back to 12k after a few days

There definitely is a bubble... But who's to say it pops any time in the next decade or more? 

At the end of the day, index funds are just the safest way to enter the market and unless everyone pulls out at the same time it'll just keep growing so long as stocks are profitable imo

Not who you replied to, but if you want a justification that I don't believe in:

From what I remember in the first half of 2020 they found that white (European descent) people had a higher likelihood of having serious complications or death after contracting Covid due to some mutation. That group also often has a higher genetic susceptibility to other lung diseases, so it makes sense. Considering the vaccine is being rushed and the front-runners are a new class of vaccines, maybe the idea is to let the weaker white groups get the vaccine first and see if there are unexpected side effects only found once it's been administered to a large population.
nothing will get me down my big batch of puts will keep me happy

He got rid of a lot of the regulations for testing and stuff to try and rush a vaccine out as fast as possible. Again, not saying it was the wrong move.

TSLA is down in Germany
Yup, with options its a true yolo because if you fuck up its gone. With stocks he’a yoloing multiple thousands but if it starts going bad they are still worth what theyre worth.

To be honest, it’s quite appealing
getting a vaccine that is through clinical Trial is perfectly safe and can't be compared to a console. on the other hand getting a Drug or vaccine that was not Tested enough might also result in your children growing Up without limbs (See Contergan), but thats why they Established the trials in the First place
Cringe.

Sell some, and keep a core position, or roll the profits into some longer dated calls like 2022 or something if you want to hold for a while.

Looks like German police will be piloting PLTR to fight terrorism and child abuse. PLTR to the moon.

No they’re just easy. With a tiny amount of effort, you can easily outperform them. I’m not even talking real research, just buy some of their largest holdings that have historically done better than the ETF as a whole

Not gonna look it up because that would be dumb but I'm pretty sure it's when something like an earnings call happens and all the implied volatility in your contract goes to 0. Like right before the call it could up or down, so your contract had some worth because it was likely going to move, but now the momentum is going so your contract has no more implied volatility.  


This is absolutely legal advice and if I get this wrong you can sue me for losses.

As I said in the post, I’ve been rolling over calls for a while. I’m currently actually not holding anything. 

I sold once it hit 25 this week because it’s a reasonable price for where the company is at currently, and the average price target. I’m not telling anyone to buy weekly calls on plug. What I’m saying is that it’s a solid long position, and you should expect it to increase significantly over the course of next year, and exponentially soon after. If you want my current opinion on how to play Plug, it would be to buy 2-3 month out contracts once it dips back down to the 18-19 range.

They are for sure not activist they do it purely for profit and they wait to share the report for maximum damage and of course they have to share the report otherwise the stock won’t dip. If they were truly activist they would of shared the concerns early on to warn investors or share the concerns early on with the SEC to protect American investors. They aren’t heroes but I’m glad someone is investigating this sort of thing even if it’s purely for profit and doing the job the SEC is not doing. No wonder papa Musk has no respect for the SEC what a joke.

I like how you think.
Since it just merger, TOS might still be displaying under BMRG, or whatever the old ticker was. Also, sometimes you can type the new ticker and press enter, it won't autopopulate a list for you like normal while you type but will direct you to the chart. Weird.
Gotcha

All right, fair point.  They need to get paid, too, and at least they're targeting scummy companies doing it.

Just rubs me wrong that they're raking it in off of people gambling on the short.

Also, did the SSR trip yesterday?  Will people even be able to short today?

I have done DD on PLTR and am a true believer. That said I bought an ITM naked 11/20 14c this week but later decided to have that backed up by an ATM LEAP 05/19/21 19c as my broker does not allow me to short sell or sell uncovered calls. Am I retarded enough to post here or should I just YOLO TSLA and be done with playing options? Any advice appreciated, flames welcome as well.

Their DD isn't free.  They know they are going to drive the price down.  They don't make it a secret that they are holding short positions when they release their reports.  The thing is - their reports are not false.  This is how they get paid for their work.

If they were making shit up - I'd have an entirely different outlook on them.

Indicators were created to control, manipulate and fleece retail investors. Same way Doyle Brunson’s Super System was used to “teach” people how to play poker. The reality is that they make amateurs more predictable.
Not sure if the website itself is legit but the article translates to:

US company Palantir:Police in North Rhine-Westphalia are testing research software from CIA consultancy

Düsseldorf The NRW police have put a new research system into test operation, which is based on software from the US company Palantir. The parent company works for secret services and the Pentagon. Targeted: felons, terror suspects and child molesters.

The new system for "cross-database analysis and research" is intended to revolutionize the work of investigators: Until now, they had to search for information about a person in each system individually and then collect it by hand. Now they are given a name "existing data of the process and case processing systems,
the deployment documentation, the procedure for processing traffic offenses", according to the Ministry of the Interior in a report to the state parliament.

For this purpose, data from the registration office, the national weapons register or the central register of foreigners can be used. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the system is intended for the fight against terror suspects, serious criminals and child pornography.

"Employees of the district police authorities and the State Criminal Police Office of North Rhine-Westphalia who are entrusted with relevant issues will in future be able to use this software to carry out evaluations of available data," said the ministry in the report.

The test operation started on October 5th. The system should run fully as early as possible in the coming year.

How much are you going to pay on CG taxes ?
The market doesn't care about your "facts".
Yeah as long as you have 100 shares. 

I have 500 shares of NIO so I was able to sell 5 contracts. I'm looking now and it looks like the premiums aren't going for nearly as much as they were last week. I can sell 5 contracts for $70 11/27 and get $100 now. I was able to get over $400 for those same contracts (though 11/20) but were still a week out).

I think the premiums were so high because this week was an earnings week for NIO. Now next week is just a regular old boring week so they're not going for as much.

This is a Wendy's, what we do here is far from investing
Watch it, it's really good
🤣🤣🤣
I agree with everything here, but I believe that cost basis isn't lowered if a sold put goes unexercised on a stock you own. You just pocket the premium as a short term capital gains. It only affects cost basis if exercised unless I am mistaken.
same here, i keep checking the TSLA pre-market price in Germany. what calls do you have?
That TSLA put lmaoooo
The NIO hype funny because it died right after the released incredible earnings and forward guidance.  NIO long seems like the play.
for some reason i’m feeling a strong urge to throw 50k at tesla tomorrow just for shits and giggles🤔
The whole thing is just a money laundering scheme for wars, sex trafficking, and slavery. Oh wait.

Good on you man. What a great set of plays. I like PTON too. But curious of all options right now why you think PTON will make the most over the shortest time period? Or do you just believe it is going to go up and don’t care how long it takes? Do you have a target price in mind or a period you will hold position for?

Been holding calls for next spring. My hunch for the remainder of this week is actually quite contrarian to yesterday’s COVID doom. Would not suggest holding those puts for too long, especially if they do make some gains. Good luck to you too bud

When did you buy
When I was like 12 my dad left me in the car at a casino so he could play a few decks of blackjack. 

But this has absolutely nothing to do with my max-loss stock options strategies. That’s not gambling, it’s called “arbitrage” and filthy card-counters wouldn’t get it. 

Positions: SPY 11/20 $366c
I don't think Bidu will be affected a lot.  they can still bail since the deal won't happen until 2021.  It's not a done deal yet, i dunno why people keep thinking it is.

I think there is a big run-up, because expectations are high. However I think that they barely meet this Q’s earnings. 

Because of that there is a lot of IV crush post-earnings. 

After that, Covid shuts down cities and investors in NYC and CA kids’ go back to school with ZM. And until February it skyrockets.

Yeah you’re right.
Did everyone just give up on NIO?? :(
Not sure how this'll work out considering im down almost 50% in total already: 11/27/20 BA 190P, the rest 11/20/20 RIDE 30C, FUBO 22.50C bot eod, SPY 355P, FB 280C
What do you mean by this.
Damn, you are highly regarded
Que no los dos?
Yes. I’m looking at current sales figures. Did vapes get slammed with taxes or restrictions? Still doesn’t account for the spike.
Still hanging onto NIO like a bitch. As soon as it hits 50 I'm out though and moving into probably PTON or some kind of tech since lockdowns are coming again
Doesn't this also apply to buy-and-hold Boglehead types?

Honestly, this is a solid play.  PTON has everything going for it, except that they cannot keep up with demand. Too much demand, exceeding supply.  A problem they are working on.   Earnings growing 100% Y/Y for 5 years.   Revenue growth in the most recent Q was 232% Y/Y.  Bad news of a vaccine has been priced in - leaving almost only upside available.  Right now any piece of new could be a massive positive catalyst; news about expansion into China, new products, more partnerships, and this stock goes right back to new highs.  The stock price reaction after the initial vaccine news was an overreaction.

For those that think this is a bike that goes no where - you're technically right and also totally missing the point.  PTON is more like FB/Instagram/Apple/Netflix than a stationary bike.  PTON is its own social circle with a fanatic user base gathered around a re-envisioned product experience with users subscribing at $40/month.  Covid accelerated what was already happening at PTON and it also accelerated the demise of their competition, eviscerating companies like Soul Cycle.

I think you will do very well with this investment.

No. WSB generally does have lots of good picks and there's a reason algos mine this subreddit. The reason so many retards are constantly blowing up their accounts here is because they are buying absolutely moronic strikes, and they have no idea when to cut losses and when to take profits. 

There are a ton of genuinely unintelligent people here constantly taking winning plays and riding them into 100% losses because they were chasing a 10 bagger that was never going to come. "Diamond hands" is the dumbest shit ever and is easily the single biggest cause of retards losing money here. The better move would be to ride all the same retarded hype trains as WSB, but also try to be one of the first to jump ship and close out your positions early on the WSB meme plays.

It indicates that many Peloton customers make use of Affirm to finance their purchases, not surprising given that Peloton's fitness equipment doesn't come cheap."

About to go dump my paycheck into nio stock
It's actually a great stock to swing trade. It hates being under 19 but also hates being over 23 so you buy at 20 and below and sell over 22. I've made decent profit but got a bit greedy this time around thinking it would run a bit more before it dumped again.
Sorry about your puts

There is a chance it will go to $20 by Friday yes. A chance.
I sold 69 cash secured puts at 52 strike, literally right before it started tanking this past Friday.

So safe to say, I'll have 6,900 shares after Friday.
I'm typically an all options player, so I'll be writing a covered call for 69 contracts at 52 strike until they get called away.
i like how you didnt admit you were wrong and just brushed it off and carry on /s

Tons of volume on PLTR, just be ready to sell at a slightly reduced price for immediate fill.
Well, 2 insiders just sold, not an unbelievable amount, but I wonder if the market will react to it. It's a rather low volume stock so just keep an eye on it and make a decision.  


I'm personally thinking of buying a $70 put dated out to December or next year
enjoyed season 1 then I kind of lost track of it.  it held up over 2 and 3?
On Monday, 16.5 was ITM weekly.  I'm not getting assigned unless a big pullback :/
NkLa hasn't been mentioned in a while, 10 bagger on gm talk tomorrow?
Yeah you’re just valuing it as a car company with no growth and you’re pretty fucking one dimensional. Bye.
PLTR is great company to buy and hold for the long term. In the short term it will have a lot of volatility. They became a publicly traded company recently, and the lock up period for has not expired yet.
Didn’t realize they got much sun in Canada
If you have enough shares, sell weekly CC at your strike until your shares are called away. Then sell puts at the price you want to buy back in it.
that's very interesting, would you care to develop?
the shit is a masterpiece

BIDU has until 2021 to acquire YY.  

https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/baidu-to-acquire-joyys-chinese-live-streaming-service-yy-for-3-6b/


That's likely so that they can do their DD.  Bulls who are still pumping YY after the gigantic tank job today based on the single argument that 'BIDU is buying!' are being disingenous.  BIDU hasn't committed to shit yet, because the deal isn't done.  YY will drill into nothingness like LK if there's any whiff of truth to the MW report.  It's very peculiar that YY hasn't responded at all yet even though it is now almost 3 PM in China.  The market is likely going to assume the worst tomorrow for YY.  It may drop a shit ton more.

This is the worst place to ask. 

For any position, I sell around 20% profit and let the rest go. 

Because you’ve passed that mark: Depending on the size of your investments, I wouldn’t sell it all because the price has gone so far up. I would only sell a portion when it was going to go to something good. Student loan, house, kids college etc. don’t sell just because it’s increased in value.

There’s the problem. Since they’re public, they’re going to have to announce each contract they get. This didn’t move the stock price, because for the past two weeks, Palantir has been astronomical in price growth, meaning that this news is just confirmation and slight justification of the current price level. However, seeing the after hours movement does not inspire a level of confidence that would make me buy calls

Insider selling of options that were still years out, constant dilution of shares, revenue depending on two customers that have big incentive due to warrants and will dry up this year, a lying piece of shit ceo, no information shared with shareholders, negative cash flow to Name but a few reasons not to buy this. I’ve been saying this ever since $1.50 though not even kidding...

There's no way to know which SPACs will announce a merger so it's hard to make money from the initial pop. I would wait for the hype to fade away, which is usually about a month or two. Then buy calls and shares when the stock has reached a low. Lately these SPACs have gone all the way back down to where they started. After the merger date, sell your shares and calls after the pop. Then buy puts right after. The merger date announcement momentum does not last more than a couple of days.
What you should've done was buy at the bottom, duh. So easy.

A bachelors degree isn’t a luxury and you thinking that is just sad. There are lots of school dropouts in South America that might think high school is a luxury but to us high school is a RIGHT. Yea people in South America without a high school education can survive and still be successful but they ultimately face more challenges. If you don’t have a college education in the US you will face more challenges as well, that’s the system we live in. And unemployment numbers are meaningless when most jobs available for non college jobs offer terrible wages. You fail to see the big picture and that’s just too bad. Basically in your mind if you can’t afford college well then too fucken bad son, it’s a “luxury” you just can’t afford and you gotta live with it, or take out massive loans am I right???

Dude. Shhhhh. Hype it like the rest of us and sell calls at open. I’m not going to get my third vacation house from selling more NIO or GME calls, they’re onto those scams. We need a new meme to push calls to the autists.
Either this is play money or you are out of your mind. Or you are the owner of Cirque de Soleil.
Not saying it's not fake cause it looks fake from the math but there are those text boxes around every piece of text and icon on the screen shot.
I read this last night and considered buying puts but fuck the retard strength on this stonk right now is too high... I'll wait another month or so while it stagnates around 22-25 and then consider it.

They don’t have options retards
what percentage stop loss do you think would cover a potential dip? im just hoping it goes parabolic long enough to set the trailing stop higher than my entry point
Will we sink our countrys currency to float our countrys stocks? In a word: BRRRRR

That was you?! I remember laughing my ass off at that post back in the spring 🤣

Why is Stripe so interesting when Adyen is already public. Adyen has all the big multinational merchants. Stripe’s biggest customers are probably DoorDash and Lyft and Instacart. It’s big but they’ve otherwise never gotten a significant % of payment volume from big cos.

EUAs will come in hot for vaccine, big pump, well drop and taper off for a lame ass new year followed by a very mediocre 1-3 quarters in 2021. I hope I’m wrong but this shit I ridiculous.

Keep the shares. Save some money up. Use saved money to dick around with being a more active trader. Then you still have the tesla shares as a safety net for when you inevitably lose all your saved loot being a more active trader!
Flat is no bueno

Are we still doing NIO?

Asking for my calls...
No depression. The economy is doing fine. The markets will consolidate, but will always bounce back. This means calls will go on sale for a limited time, like a holiday special.
Lame.  I was enjoying finally being able to trade without worrying about a tweet or some crazy scheme
Tomorrow is a dip day in the markets

CEO sells $17M in shares from an option which they paid like 10 cents a share to get the shares. It isn't like they sold a massive % of their shares.

Rocket will still be a company in the coming years obviously, but the housing market is at a weird time right now, and when the loan rates go up or the pricing bubble pops, rkt will be in some trouble lol. Warren is well aware of this and wouldn't touch rkt with a ten foot pole.
fuck it, im just gonna split 10k between FCEL and CIIC, and hope for the best
None but gun to my head I’d pick FCEL, had like 20x the volume as ciic or sono today so at least you know there will be enough liquidity to get out when things immediately go south. Keep in mind you will almost certainly get immediately stopped out on open volatility on any of those three
Ia have no idea what any of that means, how much did you invest?

It seems like Ford and Dodge are going to take a stab at EV’s and this probably solidified their spot on the index for the long term future. It really seems more likely and symbolic for them to remove an oil company from the index. Consensus with the people smarter than me seems to be an oil company.

Edit: Chrysler is on the index and Chrysler makes Dodge

I have an entire lefty account and an extreme righty account, completely separate. I figure each gives me half of the story.
It’s mentioned in a bunch of the news stories like this

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccines-could-be-available-end-december-here-s-what-n1248135

> First, the EUA application will be reviewed by a group of advisors to the FDA called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC. This group is scheduled to meet on Dec. 8, 9 and 10, sources told CNBC, and will likely review Pfizer's application.

No EUA’s won’t happen until mid December the schedule is already laid out. There will be mini pumps from Pfizer filing to get one, and then Moderna will follow, but the FDA doesn’t actually decide until December 10th and then the CDC will authorize shortly after that (like a day later). That’s when we get EUA
Plz be ford. That would be like...idk. Is that even possible? Ford is an OG, trying to take F out even if they were on their last dollar would be like removing a piece of the constitution. Yes I just compared boomer ford to the constitution. I need a dab and some coffee. Yes hello.

It's like trading any other asset, buy low, sell higher. I don't know how you trade stocks but if you use TA, just look at currency charts, they pretty do the same thing as any other asset. You'll just have to adjust for % moves.

Yes, I came across their Apollo product. This is too good to say that it’s does know when to push updates to customers without downtime. For rest of folks who doesn’t know how many updates they do in a week is 41,000 and they have one operational team to overlook for their customers. 

Integration of various sources and presenting in a sensible manner is quite crucial.

Reading his comment again, maybe not.
If you have 100 shares of something, you can sell a call against them. So say you bought 100 tsla@400, right now you could sell something like the 11/20 $500 call for a premium of $730, you keep the premium no matter what, and if tesla is above $500 on 11/20, you have to sell your 100 shares for $500, and if tsla is under $500 on 11/20, you keep your shares (plus the $730 premium you sold the call for).

I'm long 300K+ on NIO.

Keep in mind the max pain strike is 35, meaning puts and calls with suffer the most.  
I think NIO will get near 40 EOW and maybe stay around there until end of next week before it starts recovering.

Too many option volume for expiries 11/20 and 11/27.  
Hold strong, their guidance was killer and you may have to bag hold for a month or so at the most.

I've lost 70K in value this week in NIO, but I'm not stressing b/c I'm extremely bullish on their December figures, which should propel the stock back to the 50's at a minimum.
nio keeps getting more catalysts. i got in at 7 and it hasnt stopped, just taken breaks. they just got price upgrades from 4 firms and consistently beat ER expectations a HUNDRED FOLD

You.... You think TSLA is gonna hit 1300 on Monday? And youre basing this off of fucking aurora cannibus, one of the shittiest companies I've ever heard of, having a pump and dump?

Acb barely has a billion dollar market cap that it doesn't even deserve. If you think small time retarded meme stock moves the same way as something that's a lot closer to half a trillion in market cap does you're dumb. I mean, fuck I'm not willing to do the math for something this absurd but TSLA at 1300 would probably be nearing aapl and Aramco market caps.

I will donate 2 grand to charity if TSLA hits 1300 on Monday morning.

Tesla pullback tomorrow, or i leave this sub forever
I want to say something to a lot of the SPY put holders here.  A lot of us thought some really horrific shit would pop off in the past two weeks and that it would rip this all asunder.  And it didn’t happen.  And I for one may have lost some puts but I don’t think I’ve ever been happier to be wrong.

I highly doubt that number is correct and suspect heavily you just made it up on the spot without doing any sort of fucking research at all. But then again, that'd be typical of someone that frequents this board.

Regardless of how valuable you feel that information is, and despite thinking it's a trash app that doesn't give you near enough information to properly invest, retail traders make up a quarter of the market after the pandemic started and robinhood has over 13 million users since August, so you do the math Sherlock, sure ain't 1% marketshare. I'll tell you that.

Down down deeper and down.
Mostly because shit companies who wouldn’t have normally gone public via traditional IPO at a NAV of $10 or higher. Any underwriter doing due diligence and creating a valuation would’ve probably forgone the process midway, but reverse mergers via spac don’t really require that much DD. It’s all about PIPE investors cashing out really. The very few SPACs that are still about and trading above 10 are SPCE, DKNG, NKLA (fuck that tho) and maybe a few older ones. Look up Daseke, BLBD, NRCG, VLDR and my favorite one HOFV. Not saying some of these won’t do well, but it’s really tough picking out which ones will.

To PLUG power idiot:  


Rebuffs:   


1. Extremely explosive  
2. Terrible BTU/volume, this is the same reason natural gas never was adopted widespread in heavy duty diesel engines  
3. Emissions... hydrogen burns hot, creating plenty of NOX which is the main component that is catching shade right now in Semi and to a lesser extend automotive applications  
4. I.C.E longevity, engines that run on exclusively hydrogen will not last long.. i'm not saying engineering can't be used to eliminate the drawbacks of burning hydrogen in a I.C.E but it's still an issue that i don't think OEM's have addressed yet  
5. This goes back to BTU/volume vs diesel, basically there is just not enough power volume per volume compared to diesel or even gasoline, otherwise they would have switched semi fleets to natural gas years ago, but, same problem so that never took off.. (it also never took off because of reasons number 4 and 3).

I'm comparing Tesla's market cap to its perceived earnings growth. Based on the market cap, people are expecting Tesla to grow 10x faster than any company in history. They not only need to execute on half of what they want to, they need to do even more. It's an insane bubble and it's obvious, sorry if you can't see that. Hope you make some money and get out before it pops.
Let the pain sear. I’ve lost tens of thousands of dollars, back to back daily.

This year is sort of a 'gimme'. It's been easy to make good returns, so take this time to figure out how and why youade 32% on the year, which is fucking huge. There are billionaires who have made their fortune earning their clients way fucking less than that.

What is the cap for ZM? Will it reach the 580 level again or the 580 buyers are life long bagholders now?

TSLA run back to 500 is definitely a breather for all the buyers on stock split day sept 1st. But ZM gapped down a lot from its 580 level.
Put every dollar you have on $CIIG and catch the runup, sell after ~50% and you're good. I promise this will pay off.

Oh yeah that bitch is going to tank hard. These SPACs pop on initial news about the merger and then the hype slowly dies. When the merger date is announced it pops again and then tanks once again right before the merger because people don't want to hold the shares during the ticker symbol change. You can't sell your shares during that time.
Just trying to be modest ya know

Because they have dogshit financials.  

Go research how Chinese companies scammed American investors for billions upon billions of dollars during the reverse merger craze of the 00s and early 10's.  Chinese companies didn't do traditional IPOs---they reverse merged with zombie shell companies that still existed on the stock market and were able to raise billions of dollars with clown car, freak show financials that no one detected because of the reverse merger.  

SPACs are very similar to those zombie shell companies.  They go public and then reverse merge with a company to go public, that way the company that's targetd can avoid a shit ton of SEC scrutiny that goes into a traditional IPO.  Tons and tons and tons of investors lost a crap ton of money on SPACs during the 00s when there was a craze.  This is the same hype again this year (NKLA, VLDR, FSR, HYLL, list goes on).  


The reason is that SPACs allow you to avoid a lot of scrutiny and stringency that goes into a regular IPO. Not all SPACs are bad --- DKNG and SPCE may be healthy, but a fuck ton are shady as fuck.  Look at the horror show of Michael Klein SPACs recently.  The only people that get rich off SPACs are the insiders.

Given that the news is slowly coming out about more lockdowns, I feel rotation back into WFH stocks will come either come tomorrow EOD or  Friday EOD! Since the tech has already had the initial dip of "OMG BAD NEWS - MUST TAKE ALL OF MARKET WITH ME", now it's gonna be "OMG MORE LOCKDOWNS - TIME TO GO BACK TO ZM"
But lock it until you actually wanna use it
Good luck - best case you get those shares called away for a profit and you can move that money around.

The scariest thing about right now is I don’t see anything worth holding longer than a year with the sole exception of PLTR. And it becoming a meme stock is getting in my head.

I think travel will explode once Covid is contained. all the pent up demand. I could see travel being part of a multi year boom with airbnb as a huge winner.

The Great Reset means that the EV bubble won't pop for years because the interdimensional lizards in the global leadership pedo cabal won't let it happen ok? get that through your heads. Calls on NIO CIIC TSLA THCB SOLO PIC
why not zoidberg?
No options though
Thank you.

I’m confused WTF is CIIC and why should we buy it tomorrow
It's been a wild ride looking at it from the outside, but I have to admit that I've been considering dropping some money recently. The fuel cell/hydrogen hype is building (FCEL, PLUG). Furthermore, with all the bombshells that have dropped, is there anywhere to go but up?
No
Sitting on a pile of cash. I sold them when stock hit $12, fuck head.
+2%
So shares on next red day (if there is one, seems like plug is about to be the goat), and then calls right after? Word sounds good, all aboard the TendieTrain, next stop: Early Retirementville.
Those bastards are cutting in line!
Socks only go up
Market is pumping off Tesla rumor only reasonable explanation
There was a story not long ago about some company who supposedly made hydrogen fueled semis and had a large order from Anheuser-Busch. Wonder what happened to them. I heard they did a lot of render work as well.
Honestly I am confident that you will make it. At least you don't have FDs expiring in 2 days. Lets just hope they stop bleeding soon and then a catalyst should come.
Bro do you chart at all
I need Target to run up past 170 again. The way it faded today wasn’t very Plus Ultra
I appreciate that🤙🏽
>u get shares or itm leaps?
Wholesome story
12 cups of ground coffee
Extremely eh
Bought tech leaps on September 2nd (literally the top), but made it all back with and then some this year. Up 32% on the year and >40% all time. Happy with my progression and system, but seeing people make life changing cash overnight is making me jealous.
Someone wrote all this. buttPLUG, all in
Wow big spender
Announcing the $1B buyback plan the same day as so-so earning was pure genius. These guys fux.

Strange phenomena past two weeks. Small caps continuously out performing tech sector. The fact is, Russel stocks are barely above the water and 20% going insolvent in two years even after the beer flu gone while tech consistently outperform, beat earnings, pure value addition to the economy. Tech is undervalued IMO or Russel is overvalued. 

PS: Lost 30% of portfolio to IWM puts. Currently long on SPY.
I have found that’s not good enough due to the extrinsic vs intrinsic value factor
I heard someone, probably here, saying CMG was a huge bubble because it's share price was so high per share. Do people really not understand how market capitalization works. It's literally (Shares Outstanding * Share Price), some people think it's (Universal Fixed Number of Shares * Share Price). "Chipotle is worth more than Apple!!" Wtf bros, get edmicated.
why?
It definitely has the free float for it

Baba is the one I YOLOd on - I worked on their IPO litigation way back when.  Like I said, I don’t trade options, but Baba will hopefully pay off & ease they years of pain I’ve felt from sinking my money into Jimmy Choos & Manolo blahniks in my 20s instead of buying Apple stock🤩
either by late December or early to mid 2021
It can't be TSLA.....can it
Did a quick research about SPACs and holy shit kind of scary how a majority of companies who started with an SPAC now trade below $10. What’s the reason behind that?
Index funds will buy about $60B of TSLA stock. Active funds (7 trillion dollars) that benchmark S&P 500 index will likely to buy another $60B TSLA. More importantly, after S&P inclusion, every 2 weeks there will be some fresh TSLA purchase from index funds. 

Insiders own 25%

Institutional shareholders 51%

Retail investors 29%

New Index funds 13%

New Shadow index funds 3%

New funds that benchmark S&P500 index 12%

That's a total of 133%. There are not so many shares for everyone.
I don’t know much about CRSR but PLTR is a rocket ship.

RKT is a mortgage broker in an era where federal law is granting a reprieve from paying mortgages and rent. Apples and oranges. And oranges are fucked.
I think thats half of step one in the the "how" OP wants...
Should’ve just bought PLTR man .. it’s a no brainer.. bought $BABA instead fuck me
Just let the retard tire himself out.

I'm thinking a dip followed by moonshot.


Also

I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to all though tasteless, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting. No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique.
It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to
much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop,
but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling.

Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with somepaper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to
avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope
that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.
I was contemplating this
problem, when I had what seemed at the time
to be a bright idea. "Hey, this is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in
history with a lot of other regretted statements. "How many Indians could there be?" said by General Custer. "Looks like a good day for a drive!" by JFK. "There! America On-line now has complete Usenet
access!" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on.
Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would
have to clean the razor of accumulated hair, which I did by wiping it on the towel.
Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn babe. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surve my work. The towel was covered with a pile of
hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know. I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction.
I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating
in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I
thought, it would dry. Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic -molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I
stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky /sweat
combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there
and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm. Unfortunately, this exertion
caused me to sweat, and when I finally
reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and
attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks.

As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of
all, as the ripe aroma of festering /sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there,
fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own blowing
right into my face, I had only one thought: "It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks." Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my
ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks.

Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins
can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil. As if that wasn't
enough, I am now enduring further torture. As
anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad.
Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat,
rather than endure this constant agony.

Friends- DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!
MOON is close
Shut up, bird!
Honestly i cannot wait for the TikTok IPO
How much ground coffee do i need to make 12 cups?

Crowds were livid back in 2000. I just saw an episode there The Rock tells fans to chant "you are an asshole" every time Vince is in the arena and they chant so loudly. Today people would get offended from it.

I also loved the whole Kurt Angle & Stephanie McMahon angle. Kurt is very funny in a nerdy way. Oh it's true, it's true.

All of them, rolling periodically to the closest expiry. 

Didn’t you read the post? He’s trying to retire
After months and months of me not buying TSLA calls, I bought in at market open. Was about to sell for an 80% gain right before close and got sucked into a work meeting. Hoping for green tomorrow. If I make decent money because of not selling, then their lunch is on me.

Ciic shares
Well if you think of it there's two conflicting reasons to buy or sell gold.. there is the argument that increased yields means more people locking in risk free rate rather than hold gold which pays no rate.. but there is also the argument that higher interest rates=higher inflation, which gold is supposed to be a hedge for..

Words and numbers. In.
Yes

In Europe they are expecting “early 2021” actual applications. They’re already discussing/passing the relevant laws and action plan.

The vaccine really won't be here till mid 2021 and that will be for front line workers.  The gen pop will at best get it over the summer.  As for this bull of 95% effective, those are limited numbers.  Will really see with first round how effective it is.

It's looking like CIIC to get in on the next EV. And that means half this sub is going to learn about SPACs after buying one.

I remember i bought a weed cookie from my friend in high school for $10 and we exchanged in a bathroom stall and i ate it before cross country practice but i wasnt feeling anything.

Yea....it couldn't possibly be due to the millions of shares unlocked for sale for the PIPE investors.......have you even ever read a single SEC filing for DKNG and how many PIPE shares exist and their price?

Overall, DKNG will be able to beat it. But a ton of SPACs get crushed after reverse merging, and due to PIPE investors reaming holders.  VLRD didn't even have a fuggin' lockout period for PIPE holders for christ's sake.  SPACs have a very bad reputation for a reason (mostly based off of their horrendous losses from the earlier 00s).
Are you a spam bot or simply retarded?

Not a doctor but honestly the Fed is going to push them through. They have to. I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the next few weeks. There will be people who will report side effects and the media will have a field day with it. Anti vaxxers will go nuts. Misinformation will spread all over and people will refuse it. Covid will not give a fuck and this shit will continue.
It's now down to logistics and humans humaning -- how fast can you build up supply, how quickly can you put it where it can be given to peeps, and how many retards (left or right) don't want to take the vaccine because they're (insert stupid reason here)
Short the housing market
Can PLTR retard strength push it over 20 this week?
ok this analogy is a little different. if you are doing shit like this you are retarded..

its the ones that wouldve been 5-10x more if you held for 2 more hours that hurt the most..

hold the line or buy more. they're still doing the test flight, it just got moved a bit. remember: this meme stonk was at $40 this year - we've already confirmed its retard strength.
So, what about the story that George Soros, is sorry he invested in PLTR in 2012,  and is going to sell all of his positions?
They eat shit. Puts on dogs
Do you think it's more of the battery technology as in the battery packs or the actual material that makes the battery? Either way it goes I think you're right. Imagine tesla perfecting a battery chemistry and then they start selling it to every EV company.

Lockdowns are unlikely and are not fully priced in. Whacko Mango is the real issue right now, market is holding its breath for tantrums against foreign enemies, trade moves, etc. A mango move against Chyna is getting priced in now. Hopefully won’t be too ugly. Might be some bargains on baba coming up.

Comparing growth stocks to value or regular stocks is inappropriate. If Tesla quit pouring money into R&D, construction, all around growth, their gross profit would quadruple without growing at all. It’s silly.

You also can’t apply one industries average multiple to a company with their hand in multiple industries, especially when TSLA has 15x the CAGR and better margins, expected to grow even further as the EV, energy storage, and autonomous markets expand. 

Software companies like Apple or Microsoft do nearly the same revenue as Toyota, and grow at similar rates, but due to their stratospheric gross margins and growth potential they command a higher multiple. Like I said before, if you think Tesla will fail at everything and just be a car company, that’s fine, but it’s undervalued if they execute on even half of what they want to.
Wait for stimulus news then yolo spy calls

I knew that... I was just too busy with work to close this out. And I really didn't expect spy to dump 1%!

Anyone know how to short hazelnuts? 

/// 

The farmer recruitment efforts of Ferrero, one of the world's biggest hazelnut buyers for its Nutella spread, may loosen Turkey's grip on the $2.8 billion industry, which is prone to volatile prices and tight supplies.

Turkey, at odds with the United States over a failed coup last year, produces 70 percent of the world's hazelnuts, leaving buyers such as Ferrero, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), and Nestle SA (NESN.S) vulnerable.
Apparently CIIC limit 9shares @ $16.40

Contrary to the teachings of this video, dropped $850 on a 01/15/21 $115 Alteryx call. Really good time to get in. Hasn’t been this low since January aside from one month. 

Probably going to sell mid December or as soon as there’s a $10 bump because that’s the way this stock rolls. Won’t become rich off a $10 bump but I just want to increase my monthly salary by $500 a month to offset student loan repayment starting next month for me. 

Not sure how alteryx will do in Christmas. Maybe it follows the market direction and soars but then again what kinda fucking nerd is using alteryx during Christmas season.

*looks in career mirror* career: accountant. More like busy season than Christmas season. Yeah nah fuk that this thing is going to soar by 12/31/20.

What is that like calc 1?
BTW if you don’t know what options are. Do some research, but essentially think of them as betting on a stock to either go up (call) or down (put). You buy one of these and gains are magnified 100x.
Man I was just fucking around with some guy (all in fun too, nothing against that dude) here and he went ahead and deleted all his posts in the same chain. I wonder if he deletes his app too when he loses money on options.

What’s a good entry for APPS?
Good thing fertility rates are coming down since there won't be that many jobs left in the future.
Don't think that's a thing -- MACD is a measure over time/cycles; you want a broader view as opposed to daily (just use candles for that).  When the value > avg, prices tend to be rising; reverse for reverse.  You'll still have mini-swings within a defined range regardless of which way the value is going, that's why I use the -5%: enough to give room for growth but also enough to stop a skid into the abyss.  Pick a bunch of your favorite stocks and look at their cost at the beginning and end of a positive MACD-value cycle; mostly you'll find a profit between the two endpoints (and a loss when the MACD-avg is higher).
What’s the test in?
Nah, if the dollar is worth less the stock price goes up
For future reference, take the Break Even Price and subtract the average cost to find the strike price.

In this case $491.17 - $1.17 = $490.

I've been dieing all week.  Saw a bunch of shorts expire.  all i got left is 4x356 spy P 11/20, 1x112 AAAPL P 12/4, 1x280 PANW P 12/18, 10x$20.5 CGC P 11/27, 3x$23.5 P CGC P 12/27.  Only call is 110x$3.5 C MFA 1/18.  Now I just gotta decide if I close my spy puts and buy longer ones tomorrow or pray it keeps dropping friday.
Why
Im at boston market right now eating chicken and corn bread
No good reasons exist why you shouldn’t. Look at their presentation and competitor analysis. They beat all of em in every aspect.
“Tesla will replace an S&P 500 company that will be named closer to the effective date” from an article I read.  Wait so we can probably narrow the list down on who it would be right?  Someone has to be unprofitable/declining
Lmao love hearing they pumped hella a few days after i sell
Okay, blah, blah, you got some facts, but for someone who has no idea what they're talking about {me}, how would you explain ARK investment buying loads of shares if this is a dumpster fire
No liquidity
I recommend boston market its really good
Can confirm. They also don't pay well.
PLTR boys listen up 

The last few days insiders have been selling shares. Today (11/18) our boy Peter sold a good number of shares plus stock was shorted pretty heavily. Here’s the document Peter filed with the SEC 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000120919120059294/xslF345X03/doc4.xml

This is part of the reason the stock hovered around $18 for a good amount of the afternoon. Others sold shares this week, links below. This confirms that PLTR has retard strength, and tomorrow will be a face ripper. The good news: lack of insider selling, shorts r fuck, and Peter literally being a gay super villain should bring us to tendie down.

Nice post.  I am also very keen on PLUG becoming the "Standard Oil" of green H2.  EV cars are sexy investments right now, but that is not where the real money is for PLUG.  But if car announcements drive the stock price for now, I'm ok with that.  It just bugs me that people are knocking PLUG when there are so many tangible assets and products here and yet, as of today and after all of the tomfoolery so far, PLUG and NKLA have essentially the same market cap.  So much for efficient captial markets ;)

Weekly options expire every Friday so large moves with such short time until expiry make the options move up and down very quickly.  I usually make smaller plays after 3, it's when everything really picks up.

Hey CIIC-gang (or whatever you're going to call yourselves): have an exit strategy before you buy-in; time to hit that was last week with the other insiders, or yesterday when it got announced.  I'd say check the technicals but who am I kidding?  God speed autists....

One of the problems I see with the IT industry is that it is somewhat emasculating for men. You have to spend hours upon hours behind a computer screen perfecting your craft, and hardly anyone outside of your immediate circle understands what you do. So the typical alpha male things of proving yourself, like physical prowess, good looks and charm, being able to eloquently speak and write, all go out the window behind a god damn computer screen.

Walmart (WMT) has a 23.76 P/E and lots of upside potential with taking market share from bankrupt brick and mortar retail and expansion into E-comm.  I should probably take all my money out of AMZN and put it in WMT but I'm in the hole, you know how that goes.

Thanks bro
but are we on the hamster wheel with options? 😳😳😳😳
It was never confirmed by the US Government but it is 99% most likely true.
Sometimes I get really happy and hopeful looking at my portfolio growth. Other times, I see the fucking megabaggers that im missing out on that make me fucking sick.
Thank you for posting something original

For sure dude. They have even been getting more boring over the last few months. I confuse my dreams with real life conversations sometimes, that’s how mundane they have become.

seems that way
In case you aren't joking, it's the implied volatility and the higher it is, the faster the options will depreciate as you get closer to expiration.
Don’t give a shit about Trump or Biden. Just smart enough to think for myself, do my own research, and realize that most of the motherfuckers out there have an agenda.

“Imagine your bank credited your account each morning with $86,400 that never carried over to the next day. What's left at midnight is lost. What would you do? You would spend it. Time is such a bank. Every morning it credits you 86,400 seconds. Every night, whatever you failed to invest wisely is lost. Time carries over no balances. Allows no overdrafts. Each day it opens a new account with you. Each night it burns the day's records. If you fail to use the day’s deposits, the loss is yours. There's no going back. No drawing against tomorrow. You have today.”

God I fucking hate LinkedIn. I’d YOLO that $86k into TSLA calls every morning.
I’ve been driving an electric car for about a year and a half and a Model 3 since March. Obviously I prefer Tesla super chargers, but ChargePoint is right up there with them and EVGo is a distant third. I live in the Bay Area and electric vehicle saturation is massive out here. 

I live in a small beach town on the coast and whenever I drive the ten miles to the store I usually pass about 20 Tesla’s round trip. The chargers at the grocery store are EVGo and I really don’t like them, their machines aren’t easy to operate and I have to use an RFID card as there’s no ApplePay for it. 

In the downtown area there are two ChargePoint connectors on the corner of a few streets, I think about six total and at the bank there’s the electrify America charger, I tried to use them once but they weren’t online, I tried to use them after they went online and couldn’t get them to work. At a mall nearby there are these chargers by SemaConnect and you have to enter the charging stall number into the app on your phone, I’ve watched people have no idea how to operate them and just not charge. Blink chargers look retarded and I’ve never used them. 

For some reason, nobody else can get the software to work properly like ChargePoint has, it’s the closest thing to what Tesla offers. At a super chargers I park and plug in and then sit in my car and watch YouTube. At ChargePoint stations I park, use ApplePay, plug in and watch Netflix. At any other station I have to solve a riddle to figure out how to charge my car, they all suck. 

But, sometimes you might need juice and have to charge somewhere other than ChargePoint. Well you’re still going to use the ChargePoint app to find that place because they have every station listed in their app. 

ChargePoint will continue to be the market learner with charging stations. I have $2,000 coming to me from a gig a did last weekend and I’m going to by $2,000 worth of ChargePoint shares because I don’t know shit about options and don’t want to lose all my money just yet as I’m just about to cross that $25,000 PDT threshold.
There's got to be someone on this sub bag holding overstock with a price over $100
why?
This really speaks to me. I made so much money on Tesla stock and then against the advice of r/investing, I came over to WSB to see what the buzz was about. Hmm what’s an option? Well I made tons of money on Tesla I’ll just buy a Tesla OTM 500c expiring in 2 days...$1000 gone the next morning. And now here I am

they also have to build the factory they mention in the presentation, though i don't think that's for the buses

“Best market makers”. Yea buddy you realize market makers are firms right? Not individuals? Cmon man. 

Like I said think about it like a roulette wheel. Everyone bets black. Casino isn’t gonna change the payout just because everyone bets black. Same thing for options. Supply and demand isn’t 100%. It isn’t as extreme as roulette but it’s analogous.

Also just FYI, my friend works at Citadel. He’s an MIT grad and every single person on his team is from a top 10 college from undergrad or a PHD.
NIO DEC 2021 Calls thats the only way.

If you decide to do this break me off bud.
$27 would be too easy though.
Now that's what I call a tendie!!!😁
I think this is a prime example these politicians just say what the base wants to hear. They’re actors. Heck, even that feud between the Democrats and Republicans is just a show. They all take money from the same lobbyists. 

This morning, Bill Clinton on some interview stated that he allowed China into the WTO so they can be a democracy eventually. He was shocked it didn’t work out. So, which party is pro business, globalization, outsourcing, etc?
Did you downvote me 😭

The key takeaway is that no one can really beat the market consistently over the long term and your best odds of success is a low cost broad based index fund.  There just saved you 2000 in tuition.

Lol basic market function...anything that’s a derivative of another product isn’t subject to basic supply and demand duh. Thought you would learn that in your intermediate microeconomics class.

Think about it like a roulette wheel. If everyone bets black and only bets black, it doesn’t change the odds. Simple one there for you to understand.

I'd say to download both.

And, given that I started with $100, I've only been able to afford 3 shares of CRSR along with 1 share of another company. I bought on October 22nd, at about $25.50, giving me a (roughly) 30% profit from only CRSR.

I'm unable to work for now given my education schedule, so $100 was all my money. I was all in. And no, I don't know the shit going on. I just happened to search for Corsair after thinking: "I should probably put this money into something useful by now... what companies-" until I looked down at my keyboard, proceeding to dig into their situation.
