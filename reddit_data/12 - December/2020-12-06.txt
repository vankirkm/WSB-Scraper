I use debit spreads all the time to manage risk. I had a bunch of TSLA 12/4 575/580s earlier this week and decided on a dip to leg out (buy back the sell legs). Got really lucky and woke up to Goldman price target increase, allowing the options to exceed what would've been the max profit of the spreads. Immediately rolled the profit into 550/600's in hopes of making the same play again this week.
And this is all old news.
If you bought Uber stock at IPO, it would have taken you over 2 and a half years to break even. And if you bought calls, you would have most likely been wiped out. ABNB will surely beat its IPO price at some point, the question is whether to jump into it immediately or not

They say they will move with the times. Right now full electric nor hydrogen will not be feasible, the infrastructure is not there.

They have stated that once hydrogen is more available they are willing to move to that and they won‚Äôt need to change their power trains or anything at all just change the generator or whatever. 

The company has a future and will transition with the times.

I have a lot of respect for someone making such a play as I don't think it was so surefire. Their sales struggle to cater to younger demographics although their pivot to activewear has been making strides. Their online and Rack/Hautelook off price has been their saving grace while their flagship stores continue to bleed. They are still closing more stores than opening and their credit card products are getting worse when compared to competing products. Although Amazon is always the competing giant on the horizon, COVID just expedited the company's need to catch up with the times. They lost a decent chunk of their workforce due to COVID cuts. It should be interesting to see as to whether they will be able to uphold their strong customer service despite the losses.

My prediction is that funds only **partially** buy their TSLA shares by the inclusion date, and will wait until January for (what they expect will be) a drop, since they didn't bum-rush to fill in December when everyone thought they would.  Funds aren't *required* to get TSLA even if they benchmark against the S&P.  I'm also not from the future so don't take this as gospel but something to consider -- would you want to buy @ ATH or wait for a down-trend to buy thousands of shares?

propecia is not without side effects though and takes a year to start working

That article was made by an Australian short seller! They said they MIGHT be investigated and shit and that they are similar to Nikola and that are a fraud.

They are not like Nikola they have real products on the road and they are using natural gas with 700+ stations. Not like hydrogen with 1 station in all of American.

The benchmark is your beta. If you wanted to compare Tesla to just the auto market then the auto market in this case would have a beta of 1 (identity principle) and Tesla would then be compared to that basket.

The benchmark is the item you're comparing to and also where beta is derived from.

When you say, "The Market" for instance, there is no "The Market" as an actual benchmark; while it is very easy to fall into the jargon the only way to make a realistic comparison is to take an index (often referred to as "The Market" as a misnomer) and use that.

Based on the number of initial targets he quoted (150) it has to include that list. People are assuming that him approaching a company means something, when it appears to me that he's approaching every one of the hundred possible and seeing if they're interested.

That also matches up with the AMA a person from a SPAC team, who talked about how many meetings they took when looking for targets.  It isn't a process where you just talk to one company - you shotgun and then narrow down from there.

That's why I thought it was shady as fuck when AirBnB came out and said they rejected Ackman. It was a bullshit "we're important" play on their part, they could have kept silent about him approaching them like he was approaching 149 other companies, but they wanted to seem like they were special for getting asked and saying no.  

Seemed immature and bad business, compare that to the classy way both parties have handled it with Stripe, making it clear it isn't happening but not denigrating the other party.
Actually same. Trying to quit but it's tough

 You wake up cold and everything is pitch black. You can't see a thing but you place your arms out in front of you and take slow steps so that you don't bump into anything. You begin to feel something brush on top of your head. You reach your hand up and feel crispy dead roots above you. You now know that you are someplace underground. You continue in the darkness as it is your only option other than suffocating from lack of oxygen. You continue down what feels to you like a tunnel, and suddenly feel cemented ground beneath your feet. The tunnel's width and height begin to expand as you gradually lose their touch on your hands. You begin to, what feels like, aimlessly wander throughout the space. You suddenly stop as you feel a cold bar on your right hand. As you investigate, you figure out that this object is metal, and seems to be a part of what feels to you like large, spaced, shelving. As you continue your adventure you look up and see a small, distant hole of what looks like an old ceiling where wind and sunshine and barely coming in. You let out a sigh of relief that you at least know you have a small air supply. You then begin to feel a small warmth and see a small orange light a little bit away from you. As you approach the light and warmth, you see that it is a man built fire on the cement floor with what looks like an orange object being burned in it with some words you can barely make out printed on them. In a white text, you see the words "More saving. More doing." This reminds you of when a local Home Depot was swallowed by the biggest earthquake known to man that cracked the ground and swallowed it whole. This then makes you wonder if this Home Depot is the same from your thoughts. As you remember this event, a distant chanting draws your attention. Before you investigate, you decide to equip yourself with a possible weapon. You take a burning log from the fire with the orange cloth wrapped around the edge opposite your hands. With this burning cloth, you now have a light, and a weapon just in case. As the chanting becomes louder and clearer, you can just barely make out the words: "God ith dead here, what only remaineth is the hope that only our magnificent leader Hometh Depoteth can save us now." As you turn a corner you see a group of people around mid 40's hovering around the fire you just visited, wrapped in torn orange cloths. A crackle from your fire stick alerts them of your presence, as they all turn to look at you in surprise, and partial fear. Once they see you, they immediately back away and huddle in fear of you. You realize that these people have probably been here for many years, and have had some sort of abuse towards them, in order for them to be afraid of you like this. You try to tell them that you want to help them, but they ignore you and remain in fear. You decide that this is a waste of time, and you decide to take action. You take your log and hold it in front of you in hopes to find some sort of exit, or escape. During your search you hear a very faint sound, that sounds like a short song on repeat. As you get closer to the music you find yourself standing in front of what looks like an office door. You open it as the sound gets even louder. You see a skeleton sitting in an office chair in front of an old computer. The computer has spider webs along with its screen, along with spider webs on the desk, chair, skeleton, and partial floor. On the computer, you see a picture of a home depot, with the caption "The Home Depot Theme Song for 10 Hours." You decide to look on the computer for any means of escape. On the computers' home page, you see "If I die, read the file."  So you decide to click on it. You are then immediately bombarded by 69 pages of what looks like a daily log of this man's life underground. You decide to sit down and start reading, because what could possibly happen from reading a log. Before you know it, you've read the whole thing. You have discovered that the skeleton was a crazy evil genius that had plotted out Home Depot's fall. The evil scientist worked for months to plan out placing small bombs around Home Depot, after blowing up the land beneath it. This resulted in Home Depot falling into the earth, and being called an earthquake. You then see an old office phone next to the computer and try to call the authorities for help, but it is so old it doesn't work. You then go back to exploring the building for possible exits, but all are blocked off by the dirt. Your hope for an escape slowly begins to fade as your options seem to be running out. But just when you are about to give up, you come up with an idea to make a tunnel. You begin to bring the dirt from the exits into the building and grab a shovel to dig your tunnel. You think back to earlier when you felt roots on your head. So this must mean that the surface is not too far away. This still leaves hope for you, and a chance for the other people to escape. You begin to start shoveling and realize that it is a lot of work for one person and that you will need the others to help you. You begin to go and search for a small group of people around the fire. It feels like it takes forever, but you finally find them. They are still around the fire, but you approach them without the fire, and in a much calmer way. They seem to be skeptical of you, but not afraid. It seems that they are afraid of people who control fire, but not of the fire itself. Weird. So you calmly approach them and tell them your idea. They seem a bit confused at first, but they are trying to understand. You then motion for them to follow you to the exit, and they start to do so. On your way to the exit, you grab buckets, so that it will be easier to move the dirt out of the way for the diggers. You then begin to assign some of them to different roles, and then you begin to dig with them. This gradually increases the progress made. Using the small hole in the ceiling to tell day from night, you keep a log of days and progress made. After several months have passed, you begin to see roots again. This sparks up hope for you and the tribe. But only about a few days later, you breach the surface. You feel the cold, cool air against your face, and this gives you immense relief. You help the tribe to the surface where they are overwhelmed with the sight. This draws you to believe that they haven't truly seen the surface in many years. Some of the older members begin to cry and hug you as they begin this new chapter in their lives. You watch them walk away, and you too, begin to leave, feeling like a hero.

If I had that much money I'd be in blue chip stocks while selling covered calls and/or low delta strangles. TSLA has a P/E ratio of 1200 when a normal P/E ratio is below 100 and below 50 for a strong company. TSLA has almost no redeeming qualities beyond a vague pipedream of somehow controlling the power supply of the entire world 30 years from now. Investing in TSLA now is just straight up gambling. Thats what you do with 3k not 300k.

I think sp500 and dji might get a moderate correction, tech keeps going. This is the best case scenario, lock down now, give people money to stay at home and by Christmas people can relax a little bit. Worst case is no stimulus and no lockdown, by Jan we can see 10k death a day, Georgia turns blue and Biden force a national lockdown. That will absolutely destroy the market.

Thanks for the info.  A couple questions: Don't people get vaccines in order for the body to develop antibodies in case of infection?  How are these any different from any other vaccine?  People will still get infected with the flu virus but because they have antibodies the body is able to fight it off.  So I don't get the alarmist position that, hey, if people find out they'll still get the virus but their body is able to fight it off because of the vaccine, they'll turn away from the vaccine.  Are you just saying that the particular framing of the virus still being within the body will cause an irrational fear of the vaccine?

They're rumored because they're hype stocks pushed by people naming companies they'd like to own, all three are clearly off the table so it's meaningless that people have named them. People wrongly guessing three tech companies doesn't mean it's tech. 

If anything it shows how horrible people are at correctly guessing and we probably won't actually hear the target named until Ackman releases it.

Staring at the bottom of your glass

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

But tendies come slow and they go so fast

You see gold when you close your eyes

Maybe one day you'll understand why

Everything you hold surely dies

But you only think of gold when economy burning low

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you love gold when you let her go

Only know reach new highs after testing lows

Only hate the road when you're missing home

Only know you love gold when you let her go

Staring at the robinhood in the dark

Same old empty feeling in your heart

Cause tendies comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see gold when you fall asleep

But never to touch and never to keep

Cause you loved it too much and you yolod too deep

Well you only need gold when economy burning low

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you love her when you let her go

PSX is undervalued in its case. It almost broke even last quarter while VLO/HFC/MPC and everyone else lost billions. It wasn‚Äôt rewarded for crushing earnings. It should be higher than where it is now by a long shot

There were some down days. The week of Thanksgiving was red the whole week for PSX at least and that now appears to be a J hook

I‚Äôm going bearish on energy latter December but with vaccine news on the 10th and 17th, which just seem like formalities at this point, the only negative would be no stimulus. Or maybe mass lockdowns again. But any down movement is going to be just random walk stuff and not a trend

Oil is probably heading to $50 by the end of next week but it has no business being even where it is right now. Also concerned that the dollar stops selling off and uncertainty around the Jan 5th runoff. I‚Äôm at least exiting my energy stuff mid December and will buy puts depending on how high things go by the end of December

For about the same price, you could be closer to the money with Mar 19 2021 $35c. You are buying time value with the June $40. When I bought the Mar 19‚Äôs there were no June‚Äôs available yet.

Any successful company taking advantage of the newest innovations (5g, machine learning, AI, etc) are going to be profitable, I believe, in the next year and going forward they'll continue to climb. Tech is unstoppable in my view.
Risky for sure. I still have margin ptsd from the march covid crash. I had a $65k margin call on my tsla stock, so that all got wiped out overnight. 2 days later the market recovered enough to be above the margin call trigger and only kept rising, but my stock was already seized and sold by then. $65k of pre-split tsla stock. That would've been massive tendies right now. The memory still makes me wince.

Bears when we hit ATH this week: *pikachu face*
Bare burger!!
You're dealing with two different animals.  When you're chosing an intra day, or a weekly, whatever, high, you don't have that same sort of fixed reference point.  It's mostly based on your subjective opinion.  As such, it's hard to model that and check it going backwards.

On the flip side, this is one thing you can look at going backwards because it isn't based on some subjective, more or less random picking of a high or low, it's based on a fixed daily set of events.  

It's also worth pointing out that the statistical edge it offers isn't anything to get super excited about.  Think of buying and just holding as your benchmark, or a sort of null hypothesis.  When you model the buy the close sell the open over a sufficient time frame you beat that benchmark, but it's not super significant.  As pointed out higher in the thread, the comparison only lead to a few percent more gain over the same time period.  It's misleading in a way to present this against buy the open and sell the close as OP did.  Or it is in my opinion.  

If I'm going to test any theory I'm going to compare it to buying and holding the S&P 500 long term.  All that's really here is that buying the close and selling the open performs marginally better, reliably, than simply buying and holding.

It might also be cool if I pointed out that when a study of this strategy first came out a couple years ago I pulled down data and modeled it myself and came to the same, less formal conclusions by picking random beginning and end points for the same strategy in tons of iterations and found that it reliably performed marginally better than buying and holding.

Which also makes it worth pointing out that I played with modeling daily highs.  Trying to define them mathematically and call them reliably.  If I'd found something, I'd be lounging on a beach in a warmer climate right now being served drinks by a woman in a coconut bikini with an exotic name, but nothing worked reliably.

Which is basically my overall "philosophy" on investing currently.  You can either pick a strategy, like buy and hold or buy the close and sell the open, that generates long term returns (and for the record, I just buy and hold almost exclusively in a triple leveraged fund) reliably, or you basically treat all other strategies (in a long term sense) as random chance ... or gambling.  Hence, WSB.

The presence of free-ranging cattle provides beneficial topsoil on farms that allows for healthier crops and sustained ecosystems, and the argument for methane fucking up the ozone layer has been debunked time and time again.

We've destroyed the land with industrial farming, using pesticides to basically wipe out entire ecosystems that thrived when cattle/bison roamed the land.

You're misinterpreting the word ***"unicorn"***. You seem to think it means *"tech"* and/or *"silicon valley startup"*, while Ackman uses it as a placeholder for *"billion dollar company"*.

That's one of the main reasons you have a bunch of kids running around claiming there's a very small pool of companies to pick from and naming tech hype brands. In reality he said he had a ton of companies in his target pool, and it's much more likely Ackman is looking for stable cashflow from a "mature" (as he's said) name brand.

It will probably be something recognizable, but more similar to his previous spacs with Burger King than with something fintech like Stripe (and it definitely won't be Stripe, all parties involved have ruled that out).

Also your TLDR should be: Don't buy it right now because it's hideously overpriced at the moment. It's a pile of cash in escrow that people are paying 30% over nominal value for.

Literally could run outside and yell ‚Äúhey Siri how do I trade options?‚Äù That would be less dumb than posting this.
Feel bad about your options losing 99% to theta last week?

Well there‚Äôs millions of people across this country with even bigger theta losses...

Yes that‚Äôs right, they bought McMansions that depreciated the second they took occupancy like it was a new car. Two years later these people are -50% on a modern day clapboard house and they‚Äôre more delusional than you about how good of an investment it was.
So... it‚Äôs stripe?

Mark this share here:

Hang Seng will be red by morning, but under 1%.
Robinhood doesn‚Äôt offer IRAs.
We are closing on a building in the new year. 2 apartments, 1 commercial. Will renovate it mostly ourselves and live there virtually rent free because the commercial unit covers the entire mortgage and costs.

As a kid I never imagined having $1000 to my name, let alone $100k or $1M.

And now, with what I have, I can see others with so much more and it‚Äôs close for me, maybe, if I keep at things, but also so unattainable.

I probably do have it made, especially considering where I come from. And when compared to my cousins or friends I grew up with, I‚Äôm rich, but I have never felt that way.
Let me just pull out my crystal ball

True that... money doesn't buy you taste!
I am a genius and the only meme stocks I will approve are PLTR for a long-term play and GME for a short-term play. All else, especially BB, are for suckers.
If SPX bounces here you can go to bed bears, and prepare for a brutal fucking tomorrow

just find a decent job (get a work pass), your salary vs income tax is one of the lowest around the world so at least not so hard to get by.

The only problem is that with the same amount of money it is difficult to have :

* Landed house
* Cars

Might be good to accumulate some wealth and then move somewhere else to retire lol.
Tom Brady needs more PPP, get fucked poors!
Haha silly Elon nobody is buying Tesla stock because its a car company, we‚Äôre buying so we can fund your ideas.
100% agree with you there... never understood these houses. Plus you get to live in a neighborhood with houses that look exactly the same as yours?
Knew I should have held those 12/7 368 puts instead of dumping them for -55% eod Friday
What IPO priced at?
Well hind-sight being 20/20, maybe me loading up on calls Friday wasn‚Äôt the best move.
isn‚Äôt boxing one of those sports that weight classes and reach matter a lot ???

So this is actually a biological/ecological phenomenon. I watch Bret Weinstein‚Äôs Dark Horse Podcast. He‚Äôs an evolutionary biologist who calls out the extreme liberal left on their bullshit. 

I forget what the phenomenon is called, but he literally used the example of the color red when foraging for berries. Basically, as something you‚Äôre looking for (like red berries) gets scarcer and scarcer, you become more sensitive to even the smallest indication of its presence (red). So even the less ripe (less red) berries, you‚Äôll still be able to find, because your brain becomes more sensitive to the color red as it gets scarce.

He was using it to illustrate how/why ‚Äúanti-racists‚Äù act like they see more racism in places where there is very little racism, but I think it might apply to the üåàüêª overreaction to even small amounts of red

This reminds me that I have a book called Economics and Evolution I‚Äôve been meaning to read for almost a full decade. There‚Äôs a beautiful overlap between evolutionary principles and economic principles

LOL, thanks for the link, wish I‚Äôd have seen it play out in real time, sounds hilarious!
I'm not uneasy. I am extremely certain it will increase in value. I'm thinking opportunity cost. If this call only generates 150% over an entire year I'm thinking there could be other plays. I'm extremely bullish on bit coin and started to scale into miners
Yeah sure. Sounds good to me. Let me just go grab my 10k I have lying around.
LOL dude. I think you‚Äôre fine but you seriously over-complicating this entire thing

Ew. Similar defensively and hood way better offensively. He shot like 49% from 3 in like 30 games last season.
Does Robinhood offer Roth IRAs? I want to get serious about my retirement.
It's printing money to raise asset prices (mainly bonds, but that forces more private money into stocks), sure they can sell those assets, but in the medium to long term I doubt they will. (Unless there's serious inflation, which they have said they'll be more tolerant of, so idk)
Mainly because of Mayweather honestly. Just two dudes following each other around a ring both climbing out virtually unscathed but several million bucks richer. Boring af.

What if the market responds to your fears? If you enter a position with fear in your heart, the market can sense your fear and it will tank your investment. If you invest without fear, the market will leave you alone.
Eh, it has clearly peaked, but it's not going away entirely. There are a lot of 50+ year old people who will never go to gyms again. And people in cities. And housewives who live in rural areas.

Some of you may be wondering if there‚Äôs any correlation between average comment volume on these posts and market performance the next day. 

10.1k comments tonight. Puts look cheap.

I‚Äôm watching it now. About halfway through. Shit is fuckin tiiiiight. Appreciate it. Thoughts about the sequel?
Don't they know that if they drop spy to 350 everyone will buy the dip and we can hit 400 by March?

Leverage using spx futures. Automate the entry and exit. That said, I suspect the outperformance is tied to the overall trend of the dollar. Dollar declining = overnight > regular session. Dollsr advancing or flat = no edge.
What's the spac play for tomorrow?

 No, that would be fed intervention and low rates. 

Stock market is severely undervalued with stimulus / Covid ending and rates remaining low.
Exactly my point bitch. House is a place to sleep, pick a nice one, not a 6000sqft slapped together pos for 500k just because it‚Äôs big

I had $120k in call options expire about 3 weeks ago in PSX, unfortunately I was in too early when I bought back in August. I‚Äôm currently 110 of the OI on the PSX $65c for 12/18 and some random OXY calls just for shits and giggles. Pretty sure I‚Äôm making that money back on PSX after Thursday vaccine approval and a stimulus bump tomorrow or Tuesday would be icing on the cake

Everything in oil was in a descending wedge for 3 months, it was just a matter of when. Wish I did shares at first though so theta didn‚Äôt eat me alive

I still think refiners are the play even with crack spreads still depressed... I also can‚Äôt believe poop producers like OXY and MRO are as high as they are
Yeah good analysis. That being said, way too many people waste so much time and effort fussing over tax implications while making insanely bad trades/investments because they don‚Äôt spend any time doing quality DD.

Ah nice. Good choice on your pick then. I'm quite biased towards AMD increasing in share price and succeeding as a company. Depending on your risk tolerance, scale some out until you feel comfortable. I don't have any doubts that AMD will only continue increasing in value (with small pullbacks) towards Jan 2022. So fully up to you! What makes you feel uneasy enough to ask?  


FYI, I don't have a position in AMD, but want one.

I took profits two weeks ago, which was a terrible idea. I was happy because I was -$60k on my way OTM calls for US Steel that I had been bagholding 4 months, and all of a sudden in 5 days I was up like $15k and cashed out. Now those same calls would be worth like $200k more than I sold them for.

I was so happy to get my money back(plus some)  that I wasn't mad at the time, but it was a bad impulsive decision that will force me to be more conservative than I'd like to be. Oh well, ideally the next time I won't be so wrapped up in a single decision that I lose my ability to make rational decisions.

Yessir. I've done my DDs in comparison to Intel and I've found Qualcomm to be somewhat viable. One of the highest Vega's I've seen so far
QCOM 1/22 200c

T- -0.0267
D- 0.3344
IV- 35.92%
I understand theta is high but QCOM is a solid company with several catalysts and has a high Vega and low IV. Sorry if I'm a bother but what do you think?

Ban penny stocks.

Not GME calls tho that's a good idea.
It‚Äôs shorted at like 130% (at under $15 so they are underwater already) so if everyone is holding shares the shorts have to buy at inflated prices to pay the shares back, whatever holders will let it go for. Could be $50, $100 or $1000 a share. Will be relatively quick (couple days) but when it squeezes will violently shoot up. It‚Äôs been very strong last couple weeks even with shorts trying to suppress it. A good earnings call (mainly guidance) or buyout could be the catalyst. If not everyone is looking at next EC as the right catalyst, qtr with new systems out. 

Shorts speculated they would go bankrupt. It‚Äôs obvious that‚Äôs not the situation now. They have 750 mil cash against 430mil debt a lot of which they are paying off early. And they have positive cash flow.

Edit: Calls aren‚Äôt too bad but with high IV will be very expensive and this is 100% a bet. No one knows when it will squeeze.

Stim checks will be brought back into play for this next relief package tomorrow and it'll pass this week. There will be a huge celebration and this final pump will wipe out most of the rest of the bears. The ones who've been holding and hoping for a correction for months will finally lose hope. Buying confidence and greed will be at an all time high. Tiktok, wsb and fintwit dweebs celebrating, feeling invincible start going all in. That's when I'll load up on short positions (VIX calls, SPY puts). VIX will finally come alive and there will be no more fake vaccine/stim pumps to save the retards.

Bears out here celebrating that their puts are gonna print tomorrow. They can‚Äôt contain themselves they are dancing all over the place. As for the bulls, they are in shambles right now.
I‚Äôve been beating on oil‚Äôs drums for 3 weeks. Check my post history related to trading wedges. I talk to someone in there about XOM $38C that had printed, then pulling profits and doing a reverse wedge to profit 1000% in 2 days off of the puts(if he would‚Äôve pulled and still held half those calls would be on fire). I‚Äôve been bullish on XOM since the Friday at close prior to their Tuesday exdiv.
Sorry, I misunderstood the wording. I‚Äôm defining market as the entire stock market. And a benchmark could be for the entire stock market or a certain industry. So if you wanted to compare the volatility of Tesla to the auto market specifically and not the entire market, would you still use beta?

SPLK is vastly superior to ESTC... The only reason ESTC is making gains is because SPLK is a shit ton expensive but honestly well worth it so an ORG not using SPLK to it's full potential will certainly make the move to ESTC because it is free. key word, free...
I have $12k of credit card debt and $20k ish of student loan debt. I‚Äôve made a 30% profit so far which is higher than my credit card interest rates, even with the capital gains tax I will have to pay..

It‚Äôs not exactly the Dave Ramsey method, but so far it‚Äôs working, and it makes me feel retarded enough to belong here despite only having $10k in my portfolio. 

I promised myself I‚Äôd pull all my money out of when I‚Äôve made enough to completely pay it all off at once. Almost there. I‚Äôll probably leave some profit in to play with.. but anyway that‚Äôs my retarded plan.

I really wish I‚Äôd done this back in college. I graduated in 2016 and went back for more last year. I don‚Äôt remember exactly when but I signed up for some stock investment account in college hoping to buy some Tesla and Apple but I was turned off by the brokerage fees. Regrets regrets but here I am.

Tesla equities are like bombs being juggled and passed around - make sure you're not the one holding when they go off lol.
Don't be fooled. Everybody has doubled their portfolio in the last 3 month. Even/Especially boomers holding. If you bought tesla at 385 a month ago and sold it at 620, you already went 80% of the way, just on one stock, in a month.
Yeah, I'm in the same boat as well. My account has been going up like $5-15k per day for the last couple weeks. And I have a lot of Jan Calls, so I'm likely going to sell everything in the next 10-15 days. But it's so tough to get so little for my money when I had 1500 calls in certain tickers for cheap earlier this year.

A couple of trailing stops triggered when I wasn't paying attention, by EoD i had lost most of my PLTR shares. Still made a good profit but also salty about those CCs

When you short sell you borrow the stock, sell it on the market at current price, and then wait for the stock to go down so you can give the stock back after buying at a lower price. If the stock doesn't drop in a reasonable amount of time, you are just burning cash in interest, so you liquidate your position by buying the stock to pay back the lender. If a lot of people do this at once the stock goes sky and the short sellers that didn't liquidate go shit themselves.
Were you okay with losing that money to begin with?

Personally I love Dak, but with our current roster I have a tough time seeing a path forward paying one guy 40 per season.

Difference in cost over 5 years between Fields and Dak would be $180M. You can do a lot for the OL and secondary with that $$$

Thanks - I spend a lot of time looking at under radar plays like this, but also have done well on some more ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù stocks.  I read a lot of charts and have traded options for about 10 years. Some are flips, some short holds and some longer term 2-3 year plays.
So I need to spend some GME tendies to award you for spurring more retards to generate more GME tendies?

Hide all your finances from her. If she hasn‚Äôt already discovered how America rewards single mothers, she will soon. Soon she will discover title IVD incentives and take you to court for maximum child support. Here‚Äôs my advice: hide all assets, buy some rental properties and hide them behind shell corporations and move all funds to off shore accounts beyond American jurisdiction. Set up trust funds. Be prepared to get ass raped for 19 years. There‚Äôs no bankruptcy on child support and if you fall behind they add interest to you arrears. It‚Äôs become a felony after a certain amount of money. Good luck my dude
Yes straight up. But you can‚Äôt erase those even in bankruptcy so if we enter a second Great Depression don‚Äôt @ me

I'm with you on HYLN, as somebody who works in logistics I was extremely impressed with their product lineup. Especially the fact that their tractors weigh so much less than tesla tractors! LTL companies are going to eat that shit up cause they want to have maximum range and weight capacity, which is tough to get with a tesla truck. I think it's a little spec rn with a high valuation but it's at a enticing level and has a fantastic future. Just needs one bit of good news to pop massive. Great buy OP! Remember if wall street bets hates on your post it's probably a good pick. They'll be pumping at 50 bucks

You were an excellent salesman and knew how to highlight the features.

You were practiced in handling objections when dealt with questions. 

When asked : " Why have you had trash performance in previous years?" 

Response: "Past performance is not indication of future, market reasons, external locus of control, reversion to the mean" 

When asked: "what are expected returns to be like when you have positive performance?" 

Response : "point to previous success and suggest and imply and implicate without promising".

When in doubt. Lean on a big brand and flash big brand names and various other investors in the brand.
We‚Äôre gonna start bouncing in 3.5 hours.

I know of some tickers that have a good possibility of absolutely fucking mooning, but if I tell you guys, then Shitron is going to know about it and they are going to come up with a reason they should go down so they can actually buy some since they are always late to the party and are incapable of making DD by themselves

Ty, ill take a look at it
That makes sense. You have to have historical data to price the options. Right?
The ministry of magic said do not mention the name -
xpeng
Another thing I forgot to mention is that you don't *need* to have 100 shares to sell a put.

You can deposit cash into your account and sell a cash covered put.

What that means is that the broker will hold your money until the contract is over.

The amount of money you'd have to pay is the hypothetical max loss. Because the lowest a stock price can go is $0, there is a natural maximum gain or loss.

As for buying puts, you don't need to have the 100 shares to buy a put. If you don't have them, when the option is about to expire, robinhood will automatically sell it to someone else and then you just get the profit.

You can also sell covered calls, but because there is no maximum price a stock can reach, buying a call has potentially infinite room for profit so you don't cover them with cash, you have to have 100 shares to sell a call.

There is also selling on margin, but thats a horrible idea. That's where you sell without actually having the money. Some guy named u/1R0NYMAN used margin to lose tens of thousands.
If you think reading charts = free money you‚Äôre just gambling

Winners never quit. Ever seen someone double their money and then say they‚Äôre never touching stocks again? No. Only losers quit. It‚Äôs only when you‚Äôre down 50% of your net worth do you quit. When you‚Äôre up you‚Äôre on a high and won‚Äôt stop until it ends.
Short term gains get taxed as income. Lowest tax rate is 10%, most of yours would be taxed at 12%, depending on credits and deductions.

I used to work at a hedge fund.  Those people were idiots and it‚Äôs defunct now.

Working at a hedge fund ruined finance for me.  I thought I was joining an elite club.  It was just a bunch of nerds who were convinced their strategy was always right despite negative returns.  Definition of a circle jerk.

One time we lost 8% in a day and I kid you not our lead portfolio manager blamed the ‚Äútrend reversal happening too fast‚Äù

Uh yeah, dumbass, Draghi dropped a bombshell and you were in the wrong side of the trade.  Your model was wrong, not the market

Edit:  also yea GME to the moon üöÄüöÄ
Yeah, don't sweat it. People here make a huge fuss about nothing when it comes to taxes. You make profit, pay taxes. If you make a lot, pay them quarterly to avoid fines. That's it.

Except the new consoles are digital and don't accept disks.

I want to love GME but Microsoft and Sony have very effectively chopped GME out of the cycle. I expect a bump on console sales but the longer term outlook is still kinda shit. Once you no longer even use disks what is Gamestop but a 99 cent store for gaming tchotchkes?

They're literally Blockbuster when Netflix started doing things online. Blockbuster tried to pivot online but pivot to what? Netflix was already buying up all the rights to online content delivery and Blockbuster got shut out. GME is in almost the same exact position, they can't force Sony or MSFT to allow them into their walled garden to sell games.

Much like Blockbuster would have had to spend billions on content I think Gamestop has to literally develop their own console. I don't see how else they get out from this longer term. And the odds GME develops a whole gaming platform are miniscule.

GME looks like it‚Äôs making another cup and handle. Will likely spike up, drop a little (potentially after earnings) and then shoot up again. Plays will be weekly calls, sell on Tuesday and buy weekly puts, sell those eod on Wednesday and then go into monthly calls.

Bet at the money on high probability games
Ex: bet the Packers to beat the Jets.. And don't do a point spread +3/+8 etc...  just bet straight up so all the packers need to do is win, so you win (NFL dorsnt care about point spreads they just want wins look at the Steelers if you need proof)
Bet a morning game
An afternoon game
And an evening game if you want to bet multiple games in a week and take the winnings and roll them into next game

Dont do parlays because you need all of them to hit and the reward isnt really worth the risk

It‚Äôs gunna happen. The online traffic this stock is getting on Twitter and Reddit is insane. We saw 5% gains last week sustained. It could hit $30 this week on all this speculation. Warranted to. Such a sick play for those who get in sub $30

I‚Äôm still doing my dd on pricing but I think both have potential. Interesting mix because one is helped by a vaccine and the other is hurt.

Saw this comment from r/stocks. We're reaching peak euphoria and autism, I'm considering going UVXY or puts tomorrow...

>I‚Äôm like you just stared 7 months ago but the difference between you and me is that I‚Äôm still trying to catch the up trend of the stock. And I also lost money buying stock which recommended by TikTok and here as well. Now, I‚Äôm going to be very careful. I‚Äôm going to read more business news from Bloomberg, CNBC and Reuter and company background before I invest. I did very well when I inquire the shit out of companies and invest. Other thing I have to watch myself is my compulsive behavior and also trying to take Chance of meme stocks.

Which broker
You can call and negotiate margin rates esp if you're over 500k which it looks like you are. I'm technically in the 7.5% margin rate as well but I negotiated it down to 6.6% and 5.1% when I hit 75k in margin.
This. Wait like 4 weeks after the ipo and then get in when its on sale

Doordash and Airbnb aren't worth buying in, right?
All the gains are made in the futures market. It's easier to pump because it's thinly traded. We used to refer to it as "the invisible hand."

Just because Elon announced something‚Äôs on their roadmap doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre actively doing shit about it.  NKLA still has TSLA‚Äôs semi concept by the nuts in court with their two design patents.

You think Uber treats their drivers like slaves? Well yeah maybe they do. But anyway my point: You seen what DoorDash pays its drivers per delivery assuming no customer tip? They literally lose money because the penny DD throws at them to deliver shitty food to some scummy neighborhood sure as hell won‚Äôt cover their expenses for gas and car maintenance, not to mention increased risk of getting into car accidents and shit like that. I mean I love the concept of a third party service to deliver food from places that wouldn‚Äôt offer it themselves but DD is trash. 

Wait why am I actually talking about a company realistically sorry wrong subreddit umm calls on TSLA and PLTR reeeeee
Yeah, but let‚Äôs be real. What percentage of people on here actually bought in under $20?

Edit: Of course now everyone that bought in slightly below $20 feels the needs to reply to my comment, completely missing the point. Just look up all of the loss posts from the last week.

Exro's advanced control technology, the Coil Driver, expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains by improving performance, efficiency, and reducing costs. Exro currently has 17 granted patents and 18 patents pending on its innovative technology. May be the next big thing in the next 2 years.

Do some reading into Detroit and its bankruptcy a few years ago. It's actually thriving as a city and all of the bad debt is cleared.

That's absolute bullshit.

TSM 1h chart has been in this channel since the end of October. Aside from the channel, it has consistently run from nearly oversold (RSI below 40 in this case) to overbought (RSI over 70) and, had you purchased it every time it was under 40 and sold every time it was over 70, you would‚Äôve made money.  


*chart here* [*https://imgur.com/a/oTf9hOR*](https://imgur.com/a/oTf9hOR)

White lines indicate the channel  
Yellow vertical line indicates RSI under 40  
Blue vertical line indicates RSI over 70

If you just focus on the area between the yellow and blue lines, you‚Äôll see the move up you would‚Äôve caught by following this pattern. Will it continue?

*note: it is correct that there‚Äôs an area of two yellow lines before the next blue; it dipped twice before reaching overbought so, since it stayed in the channel, you could‚Äôve bought both dips*

Other notes for TSM:

\+ RSI currently at 66 so we have a chance to wait for the sub 40 RSI dip tomorrow

\+ TSM is in a long term uptrend

\- The 4 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts have a median target of 79.75. The median estimate represents a -23.13% decrease from the last price of 103.75.  


I suppose another option could be to buy every dip below 40 RSI as long as it stays within the channel.

Well, taxes are easy for the most part unless you're doing something with an estate. The 1040s were redone under Trump ( strangely one thing I absolutely think was a really great idea ) so yeah, they are way easier than they used to be, but Sched D and E are still somewhat unfriendly.

Not.
They don't have to only show their own, but could just prefer their own, and not show ones they want to blackball. They can limit the run for other movies when their blockbusters come out too. 

Disney has Fox now too, they make a good percentage of films if you weight it by each films gross movie sales, Wich Is what you would consider if your looking at profitablity.

If Dis owns AMC, and WB owns Regal, they could only show each other's movies and freeze out everyone else, all indies, etc. Would disappear. Except for streaming releases.

No, not really.  You're buying at market price at close and selling at market price at open.  The only "timing" is relying on ... I guess you might call it a statistical assumption that over a sufficient time frame you will tend to catch more of the gains in the overall index.

Making money off of baba puts after losing so much much after every fucking drop on calls is going to hit different tomorrow
This is by far the best meme in this sub. Thank you ü•≤
This made me laugh more than you think
The easiest and safest way to be a millionaire is working hard and long APPL every paycheck.

tech is the only future and APPL is at the top. they will never fail. I strongly believe tech industry will devour entire wealth of every single nation. To survive in the future, you should work in tech industry or having their shares a lot.

Bulls don't want a gap up anyway, cause you know it'll get filled during RTH
Started buying BB 5 years ago believing the turnaround had happened.  Got in at $13 and then $7 pretty heavy, rode the train down to its low and pretty much went all in at $4 and $5 and im glad I did.....im a believer.  Have 1490 shares now, thinking about doubling down again.  Also have that new phone coming out in 2021, they have a deal with a Texas startup OnwardMobility.  Idk if the phone will be a success but it will get their name out in front of the public again.
SPACs love a hot market. Just watch them dive back to their initial offering price if markets get hit

I make about 1/2 what you make. To me, it sounds like you're set you just don't realize it yet. Granted this is a surface level conclusion seeing how we don't know one another. 


If I was in your position financially, I would throw that 1 mil into a NNN leased commercial property. The ones in my area cost ~1-1.5m and you'd see 100-150k annually in rent. Since it's a NNN, you don't pay for the real estate taxes, insurance, repairs, updates, etc. 


Try to relax a bit, you're doing incredibly well. Hell, my entire goal of retiring young would be achieved by reaching what you've already got. Think about that. 


Or, you know, go full retard and throw 1 mil into GME tomorrow. It would sure help my position out if you managed to trigger that short squeeze for us autists.

It is showing an RSI of 85 which means its very overbought. However, the news came only today about the most recent success.

Or do you think this thing is going to run up for a while more?

I mean that‚Äôs what it is. But it‚Äôs possible all your profit will be eaten up in commissions. I guess you could buy shares in an s and p index and sell everyday at close and buy at open. But this is boring shit not WSB shit

$21/share for CCL seems steep when you‚Äôre in at $9/share.
Love üçè been selling covered calls on it and putting profits back into stock to sell even more. Still think it will stay within 115 - 125 range. 

Don‚Äôt care if it goes lower, actually hope it does because I just point my dick to the sky and buy more like a ruthless CEO.

O totally, I'm in the same vibe. I had a Corolla for a few years and it was a bore to drive and couldn't store my golf clubs and other gear in it.
Saved up 5k for a down payment on a 2017 Rav4 and it was a great choice, I love it and it's fun to drive....but it's also 10k more then the Corolla :0

It would be chill if this dip holds so I can sell off these Sunrun puts I picked up on Friday. Friend of a friend said they were having batteries explode on the down-low.

If Vaccine is good then I think Cruise will sail again by Summer 2021 but I think NCLH will get to $30 before end of this year because of Vaccine news. 

Obama and Fauci will be one of the first big guy that's willing to take vaccine and Obama will take it on Live-TV so I think the Vaccine news will boost the Travel stock overall.

Yeah the $31 billion valuation was their Series F and was reached by September 2016 so all I‚Äôm saying is it has been flat for a while cause they didn‚Äôt raise new capital except the emergency round for almost five years since they print money

Compare to Uber and others which were pumped to nearly $100 billion with a bunch of late stage rounds when they were initially similar in valuation.

Uber has also gone up a lot since IPO but the bankers took a lot more for themselves and the investors. Airbnb has been growing for years without an upward valuation revision so it doesn‚Äôt surprise me there would be a substantial one.

The objective of both sides of the strategy is to receive continuous premiums from the contracts you‚Äôre selling, whether it be from covered calls or cash secured puts. The reason why we go back and forth is because when your CC gets exercised, you‚Äôre in prime position to sell CSP and vice versa when your CSP get assigned.

XPEV could have an interesting dip or breakout buy tomorrow as it seems to be wedging out of its recent beatdown.

Dip zone 48.70 - 47. Breakout above the top blue trend line \~50 - 51. Tight cut loss of 45.75. Chart shown is the 30m chart, *here* [*https://imgur.com/a/cmpnM7a*](https://imgur.com/a/cmpnM7a)

Other considerations:

\+ RSI @ 41

\+ In a long term uptrend

\+/- MACD not sending a clear signal yet

\- Analysts' average price target is $40.67 ‚ñº (-17.57% Downside)

A bit of a mixed bag but, if it breaks and holds, it could have a good run.

Don't forget, tax will kill retail traders, since you're taxed on all gains, and likely you'll violate wash sales rule year-round. 

Do it in Roth or 401k.

If you think that's for sure gonna happen not gonna change your opinion but you can Google the axios article and it'll give you more context.

Westport fuel systems CNG RNG engines with Cummins are carbon zero emmisions and save 30% vs diesel. Hyln has ~no savings vs diesel and the range is overstated and at best matches the range of a diesel or CNG RNG engine. Rather than use RNG CNG to charge a 800 battery in a truck one can simply use the RNG CNG to power a more efficient engine without a 800Lb battery weight, costs and be further ahead. This is what Europe is doing and that is more likely to be the disruptor towards the trucking industry. CNG RNG engines. Not CNG RNG powering an electric drivetrain. This isnt popular on this board but don't buy the hype and PowerPoint self promo presentations. Tom Healy ceo of deflategate science and previous venture making a football helmet?? Not an electrical engineer nor CEO with any Ed experience or expertise in this sector. Serial entrepreneur. Fabricated savings for erx that were not true in road testing. Last q results showed no contracts no sales despite projections and promotions of sales. Only sales to an equity owner of Hyln itself. Not authentic.

Anyway using an acquisition corp doesn‚Äôt necessarily solve the problem. They need to convince the company not to IPO by offering a convincingly high price per share. It‚Äôs easy to blame the IPO but the fact is something with high demand is going to go up in the dealmaking stage regardless

It is going to start burning extrinsic value real hard. I usually try to roll out at about 3-4 weeks before expiration if I still want to stay in the play.  The last two weeks are a big play on gamma but that can go either way, while the theta burns negative for sure.
This is really, really bad news. 

If options become overweighted derivatives that will cause all sorts of defaults and wild IV swings that can't be predicted. It'll fuck everyone. I mean everyone. Institutions and retail.

I just wonder where the breaking point is.
Neither should ever be the move until another cruise takes off... I say that as a shareholder. I don‚Äôt trust the cruise line market right now. Should go down, only goes up. Don‚Äôt get pissed when it does go down.

It literally doesn't matter but the more memey the stock, the better, as you will have higher volatility....You know.... Due to the retardedness of everyone here.
Its a minimum of 5 days with other exceptions like share price anount of shares publicly traded etc so its not as cut and dry as that-and definitely not an option after 3 days, but you let me know how those abnb options are doing next Tuesday lol

If you compare Airbnb over 2015-2019 to Booking over 2009-2013, the two almost match up exactly in terms of gross bookings volume (or in other words, scale).

Despite that, over these respective time periods, Booking raked in over $21 billion in profits, while Airbnb recorded an aggregate net loss of over $820 million.

This suggests there may be a potentially structural difference in operating leverage between Airbnb and OTAs like Booking.

As you and your wife peer into the baby monitor, you both start laughing. Your daughter--in her war against sleep--is having a conversation with the stuffed animal lamb you gave her. The conversation is nonsense, of course, but sounds very intense.

Suddenly, your wife kisses you hard on the mouth. Your teeth click, and you can taste the red wine on her tongue. She wants number two, and so do you. But you push her away. "Just a second." She moans, in exaggerated frustration, but smiles sideways at you as you slip into the bathroom.

From the toilet you open Futures. And feel yourself go limp. She calls to you. "What's taking so long?" She calls to you. Like you called the market. You don't answer her, just like the market didn't answer you.

Do both. Take ten percent and go full cowboy wsb. There is actually genius in what wsb is doing from the perspective of fat tails and assymetries. And have another larger portion to index funds.

It's the same with any big debate, the truth is always in the middle. This nutrition, politics, ect.

Would you buy this dip on the Chinese EVs? NIO and XPEV are legit hitters in China with production and deliveries. Entering the european market soon too. You think this past week's selloff was a correction or actual fears concerning risk of delisting from investors? Any thoughts on their future?
Real picks don‚Äôt need a fake pump.
DoorDash- we still haven‚Äôt the slightest idea of how they are profitable

For that matter, am interested in being the counterparty in each of those trades üòú
Why china dumping? And why‚Äôs baba so red over there? Don‚Äôt mind buying puts, just wondering why

New FCC chairman in January. Ajit Pai, former Verizon Councel, who concluded zero-ratings investigation for telecom and fought to repeal net neutrality is stepping down. Lots of unusual put activity on ISPs too such as Altice and Comcast. Fuck em.

Don't worry. They won't even be entitled to a roof over their head after I mortgage my house and buy NIO calls with the money.
Panik is coming from Hang Seng being down 1.5
356 or 352. 358 was nothing.
Big question is can they take us there soon so I can dump these calls and buy more GME shares

Screw fang. SPACs are the new money makers
It will be an even better buy next week.

Bears might finally get their wish.  We all knew it was happening as Axios reported it but it got washed by vaccine news and was still "he could but he won't territory"

That's right. But again there's a distinction between short-term tax (holding for 365 or fewer days) and long-term (holding for 366 or more days) tax. So do the same calculation but now with a higher tax rate and see how it's even more different. There's the added bonus of the first \~$40,000 of long-term capital gains being tax-free, not something you get with short-term capital gains.

Good tables here: [investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp](https://investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

Customer service: you can call your bank when you have a problem and it will be your banker that answers the phone and handles the problem for you.  Companies like stripe and square use call centers which is a huge turn off for business owners.  

We also offer perks such as free premium accounts and offer other products (lending/treasury) at discounts or even are more lenient on a businesses lending limit when they have other relationships with the bank.

It may seem like these products are better and I have lost customers to them but they typically will come back to us after a year or so with horror stories of these companies

Actually your reason is why imo you want to take advantage it here. Under normal circumstances the implied move would be half of what it is, in which I wouldn't want to sell these calls. But in this circumstance, because of what everyone is expecting, I would rather sell calls (since MM will be more likely to inverse - after all they sell a bunch of these calls and their goal is to make money too). I would wait very last moment on Tuesday to do so though. The higher IV is caused by this short squeeze expectation which I don't think will be 30% this week.

OP more good news coming for us AMC bears. SoCal cinemas are closed for weeks and an insider told me DIS is expected to announce their own 2020 release plans similar to Warner Bros at this week‚Äôs investor day. DIS has about 70% of the box office market share  and has everything to gain by an AMC bankruptcy. Mickey don‚Äôt like AMC taking 50% of box office sales when he‚Äôs got to pay all the marketing costs. Many options but the most likely is the mouse can pick up  a handful of AMC‚Äôs choicest properties in major cities and begin Disney Theater Experience in 2022. DIS absolutely does not want all 620 - oops 618 now after recent Ohio and TX permanent closures- AMC locations.

Bulls r fuk
Damn, is this real?
That‚Äôs got a lot of extrinsic value, meaning it‚Äôs getting value from potential to go higher than $10.9. If you think it‚Äôll continue growing higher by 12/18, you‚Äôll start losing that extrinsic value and starting having intrinsic value, the value the strike is under the market.  
So to sum it up, if it stagnates until 12/18, you‚Äôre losing money. If it continues going up, you‚Äôre making money. If it drops, see ya.  
I would sell but up to you.

Evening, boys. Bear or bull let‚Äôs all make some fucking money before the end of the year. That‚Äôs the name of the fucking game.
Was waiting for the PLTR call meme massacre to jump in thanks for the buy indicator.
Not exactly, Vega is the change in price of the contract due to iv. The Greeks tell u how the price of the options moves. 


Imagine it as the other person when you buy a call. If you buy a call and the stock moves up, then your call‚Äôs value increases, someone is receiving your premium (the seller of the call) and their value just decreased, so they can close the option (sell to another call seller) but at a lower price than they bought in at. 

If the stock price falls again just before expiry and your call option expires worthless then you lose your whole premium to the seller anyway, as the premium always approaches zero at expiry at a constant stock price. 

Just smoked a bowl so I hope this makes a little sense, but if you‚Äôre asking because you‚Äôre interested in selling covered calls or secured puts, the best way to see how it works is to try it out either paper trading or just with a penny stock. It‚Äôs easier to see how the options price moves with underlying stock that way.

And rewriting history to say nobody eats bats there while simultaneously saying the wet market bats were the source of the coronavirus?

Definitely dont need a solid foundation of lore for the Mandolarian. Theres a lot of rich star wars lore and Easter eggs hidden about the series but you dont need to know jack squat about any of that to enjoy this show.
Honestly it was worth the hundreds of dollars I lost on PLTR just to feel included in the memes

Dude that‚Äôs not at all how it works. If you want to import them you have to pay them more to justify hiring over a domestic candidate. Companies cannot find the talent domestically.

And I didn‚Äôt just work with established clients, I left that side to work with middle market and lower middle market clients also. The opportunity is there. Not sure where you live, but you may have to move to make it happen dude

Edit: and making a killing is the opposite of 10/hr. They‚Äôre not stealing jobs any more than Hispanic laborers are. Simply put most Americans don‚Äôt want to work construction/landscaping or tech jobs so people who will work them come to fill the void. It‚Äôs pure play capitalism at work.

>Major healthcare systems just would not go for that. EVen assuming their tech is both cost-effective and non-inferior, their proposal disrupts (not in a good way) too many things simultaneously (radiologists' and technologists' workflow, reimbursement, existing vendors etc.)

I'm not sure about that. Healthcare systems are a business at the end of the day. Spending up to $1 million to buy a system vs getting a Nanox setup for free seems like a no brainer assuming that it works even if their is resistance from staff. Even with bailouts/etc health care systems took major financial hits during the pandemic and will take a while for recovery. It would be fiscally irresponsible not to evaluate if it doesn't work.  
This also doesn't take into account all the urgent care facilities that might jump at this as a chance for additional revenue source.  


I do agree with your point on more publications/papers though. I think they need to show more. Haven't they published on this tech though via the team at University of Tokyo?

Ok I just understood it. When you pay 20% tax on gains each year, a 10% annual return becomes an 8% annual return. That‚Äôs worse than taking 20% off a 10% annual return at the end.

In sheets I just calculated that if you start w/ 100k and buy/sell effectively reducing a 10% return to an 8% return, you have 931,727 after 30 yrs. If you start with the same and grow 10% annually, then take 20% off at the end, you have 1,269,047.

First of all, you are working with established companies/clients. That's why I put it in quotes. You have no idea what the market is like for 90% of new STEM graduates. If you even glanced at the statistics you would know.

Second, you admit yourself:

\>they \[Indians\] make a fucking killing. 

\> There is a reason they‚Äôre demographically becoming one of the wealthiest immigrant communities 

So you just affirmed my point that they are stealing American jobs, regardless of their income specifics.

At least you admit as much. Most won't even go that far. There is a reason real wages have been declining in the US for decades, and that reason is globalization, the entire point of which is to UNDERCUT American labor.

Rumors will pump a stock and then when the news comes out the stock will come back down to where it should have been. So say a stock starts at 100, rumors come out and it moves to 110, news actually comes out it corrects back to 105. Still up from the original but it looks like it went down from the news.
It was a real thing until fairly recently.

Me too man. But how can you pump a SPAC is what I‚Äôm thinking. Sure, they could have bought at 22 or 23 and are trying to pump to $30 pre announcement, but that‚Äôs at best. This is a stonk that won‚Äôt soar aka get pumped until the company is known. So I‚Äôm worried about these pump posts, but not that worried. Because I believe in Bill‚Äôs eyebrows.

 Airbnb [**ABNB,** **-3.41%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/ABNB?countryCode=CH&mod=MW_story_quote) is boosting the range to between $56 and $60 a share, from $44 to $50, people familiar with the matter said. The new range would give the home-rental company a valuation of as much as $42 billion on a fully diluted basis.
If you ever feel like you are making terrible plays, know that there are still idiots "buying the dip" on NKLA since $94
I feel it has no meme potential as everyone understands what Airbnb does, the CEO and other executives are less interesting than a loaf of white bread, and it‚Äôs business model isn‚Äôt retarded enough for this sub.

That figure is arguably marginal considering the time and effort cost over 27 years. One big positive is that you could manage the trades to miss some huge red days during a sell off. Taking a 3 week break in Feb then buying back again would create some huge gains for 2020 using this

I'm not sure I follow. An investment will be exponentially larger in 30 years than in 2 years. In terms of taxes they'll both be taxed at (roughly) 20%. But I'd rather keep 80% of a bigger pie.

Best way to go is create a Google Sheet with columns for investment value, capital gain, and tax rate. Watch how it can compound from year to year whether your sell or let it grow. Also notice how much tax if paid.

Supply chain issues. They have huge demand right now (so really I‚Äôm very bullish on GNRC), but they are months out for delivering products.

If that's the case, I wouldn't look at any BMW with forced induction. You're going to be looking at more maintenance costs if you're racking up high mileage. If you absolutely must go BMW, consider a 328 or similar non-turbocharged model with a simpler powetrain.

That said, I'm an Audi guy and can tell you that the only way to survive is to lease and/or have a warranty, or do you DD on the chassis/engine/powertrain to know what maintenance red flags might be around. (This goes for all German or lux brands.) It's not impossible to wrench yourself, but that requires space, time and desire to learn how (or experience), and slightly less money than going to the dealership/specialty shop.

**tl;dr**: High mileage daily driver? Get reliable, boring-ass a Civic and sleep easier.

Getting some really good stuff out of it though. The TA capabilities are night and day. Still trying to decide on the best method for visualization.

Any input would be appreciated; throw this an upvote or comment if you‚Äôd be interested in such an indi, also. I‚Äôll definitely publish and share in here if there‚Äôs interest.

This is actually good play. Most people here are just used to buying after the stock is up 50%. Is there any way to know if most warrants have been exercised?

Some real life FIRE shit going on.

We live with my wife‚Äôs parents, have a reasonable car (okayish suv, $35k cost with 0% loan), and other than gambling on wsb shit my only other vice is a high end mac every few years.

You‚Äôre a liar. I do know what I‚Äôm talking about. I work in tech advisory. I also used to work in tech consulting financial management. Meaning, I was personally responsible for the financial analysis, productivity analysis, and hiring packages for tech consultants, engineers, developers, etc. on over a quarter billion in tech project work. 

I can say with 100% certainty that you are either a total fucking liar or you and your friend are complete idiots. If you truly have a stem masters and you‚Äôre working blue collar, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs wrong with you, not the workforce or recruiting. 

As for the Indians you‚Äôre trying to characterize as cheap labor thieves, they make a fucking killing. If you knew anything about H1-b recruiting you‚Äôd know they don‚Äôt come cheap anymore, especially with graduate level certs. There is a reason they‚Äôre demographically becoming one of the wealthiest immigrant communities and it‚Äôs not because they work for 10 bucks an hour. Get a fucking grip and stop talking like a labor cuck. If you keep lying to yourself or stroking your emotional boner, your opportunity to get your career on track will pass you by. Good luck.

December 2018 Tesla was trading above $370. 370x2=740 his contracts were for 680. I totally understand your skepticism but these contracts existed, I saw them myself because i looked right at them and asked who in their right mind would buy $600 LEAPS on Tesla? I remember these contracts because earlier in the year JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley came out and said Tesla could see it stock drop to $10, so I looked at LEAP puts and calls. 
Im not saying this guy is legit, I have no clue but what i do know is that these LEAPS were available, and higher, when he claims to have bought them.

I think the compounding effect cancels out tho. Because in a buy and hold scenario tax grows exponentially and so does untaxed value. In a case where you buy and sell instantaneously every two years and thus pay tax every two years example, your untaxed value stays untouched and grows at the same rate. The other commenter brings up a good point which is that short term tax is larger than long term. But i want to say this is the only difference

Ask literally any millennial with a degree. 90% of them have the same story.
Stripe may not need funding, but 10 years is about the magic number for a company to be around without employees having liquid equity.  Uber, DropBox, Pinterest, and many other unicorns went public by that time or soon after.  Stripe apparently also isn't listed on secondary markets, and even if they were, private valuations have an illiquidity discount.  Enough of their employees have got to be getting to the point where they're buying homes or starting families and want the other half of their compensation to be usable.  I work at a different unicorn startup and once the business is mature and close to profitable I think there would be a revolt if we didn't go public.

Also, the Collisons say that funding and valuation is just a secondary consideration at this point and they are focused on growth and the product.  Well, if that's the case, going public via SPAC seems ideal, since they don't need to worry about getting distracted by the IPO process, and don't need to issue much float.

I think I will go for another ride with you good sir.
oh, I see; you're not fond of commas. in any event, the point has nothing to do with monetary policy. regulators completely turn a blind eye to the massive amount of dirty money flowing through the banking sector because were they to attempt to put an end to it the entire banking system would suffer an immediate top down collapse

People like weird shit. You might be hot to a solid 10 just because you have features they like. Keep fishin it‚Äôs a game of patience sometimes.
I‚Äôm more of the smart money vs hardworking type and it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm lazy. Worked landscaping for two years, factory job for a year, and construction for a year and I‚Äôm 19. I made $750/week in construction working 12 hour days, which was cool until I found out I could press a few buttons on the stock market and make $2,400 in 30 minutes
So you're going to hold those losses until next year, right?

So I tested Airbnb right just now (Am in China, 3rd tier city), the nearest rental is an hour away from me, and the price is way more than the local hotel.
At what point do you just give up on trying to make friends or have people you connect with outside of family?

Lol. You are so thin-skinned it's hilarious. I have nothing against TSLA investors and I'm not an SPY VOO guy. And I love Musk. Wish I could invest in SpaceX. But you can't tolerate anyone questioning TSLA valuation. And you haven't bothered trying to justify it in any way. Good luck making millions off something that has already had one of the most ridiculous runs in stock market history. 

BTW I already didn't make millions on TSLA and am totally fine with that. I bought and sold 5 days later ($55,000 worth) in 2017 to make $1,600 in my 401k. If I held it would be $600,000 today and would put my net worth well over 1M.

I 'm not sure what you are missing, but I think it might be Compound interest.  Like, the tax man is going to eat a % of each years returns in April if you are  us and October if you are orange.  Now, the deal with this is that assuming you don't pay taxes until 30 years from now you have grown on the tax paid over the same period. So Why you may pay mover over all, you have also been gaining more over all  and in a compound manner which means you should net more in the second scenario.

Highly doubt it's Subway, why would Bill acquire another fast food franchise when he already as 3? Pretty sure that goes against portfolio diversification lol. Also, would you consider Subway a "high growth" company? I sure wouldn't.

Realistically, I think we either get Stripe, Coinbase or Bloomberg. I am optimistic though, and I think anyone here would kill for SpaceX (very unlikely), Epic Games, Robinhood (would probably meme triple in 2 days), or ByteDance. Regardless what we get, I agree with you in that the reason I'm investing is because of Bill. He's been through this before with Burger King, so he knows what works and what doesn't.

Also, if breadfruit ends up being right about Stripe, I'm never questioning him again lol.

What if we never hear from this again
How owning puts works:

Day 1: even +/- 15%

Day 2: open at -37% and spend three hours waiting for downside while it bleeds to -48% until EOD selloff leaves you at -14% so you hold overnight expecting to break even the next morning

Day 3: open -80% before swinging up to -34% (this is it, you think) but then a pump comes through and you‚Äôre back at -74% 

Day 4: open at -88% and sell for a loss 

Day 5: your puts are now up +800% so you buy them back with what little you have left 

Day 6: go back to day 2
Could be worse. You could have -$30

Are you taking about capital gains tax? This is something I‚Äôve never understood: how is selling and paying tax on each trade any different than paying a fat capital gains tax after 30 yrs? If it‚Äôs a percent of gains then it should be equal either way. Because tax grows just as exponentially as gains. Like if you sell and buy at the same price every day sure you have to pay tax on the gains from the day before and it shrinks portfolio but you pay less tax down the road right? Because gains start at zero again at each buy. Do you know what I mean? I‚Äôm obv missing something bc common knowledge says otherwise.

Me too.  Never seen that before.  I think it's because such a high percentage of the investors now, are young enough to not remember the dot-com bubble or even really much of the 2008 crash.

RKT has been a great CSP play for the past couple of months. I'm using proceeds on weeklies to buy shares. There is no stress from watching it trade in its channel. When it finally breaks out, I'll essentially have only free shares.

It finally made a new high recently, but if there was new money still flooding in, like it was before, then why the pullback and constant failure to go higher?  And now that we have, how long will it last?  Obviously no one knows(it's impossible to predict) but if I had stocks, I'd be rolling out of the market already.

No, I haven‚Äôt. But there are enough reasons why this would go up again. Delisting was faaaaar overblown and IMO NIO is doing amazing with their technology and their targets. I really do believe that they provide a solution for the biggest downside of an EV, being charging your car.

For the calls, yes - I should have been most specific. 

If it behaves anything like the EU/UK announcement the share price will spike a little but still floor at like $40. Calls will only spike in worthwhile value momentarily.

Not sure if it will help you any but I'm a big believer in drinking cranberry juice when you are sick. Been drinking a ton of that along with orange juice and dropping in Airborne tablets (immune booster). I hear taking a lot of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc can help you out.

What are you even doing here then
Time to find out if holding tsla calls through the weekend was the move or complete failure
Three months for almost all the shares
Your risk proposition hasn't changed, it actually is technically higher given you assume liquidity risk by holding the asset overnight. There just existed a small arbitrage opportunity that could be capitalized on for a period of time. 

You need scale to make this both worth your time and your dime. Assuming the net change between close and open (doesn't include down days or other freak swings) is 0.001% (a tenth of 1%) per day. After a year or about 250 (simple math) trading days, equates to a 25% return on the market from JUST that trade. Awesome, winner winner chicken dinner. But you CANNOT miss a single day, cannot "instinct" extra gains, just simple, open-close every day. 

But say you have trading fees, let's assume $3.00 per full circle trade. You need to make above $750 per year to cover just the fees. To get to $751 to even show a $1 profit. That is currently ~9 shares of the SPY at its last close ($369.85) or $3329 invested to net $1 above fees to your pocket. Congratulations, you made $1 on $3329 not to mention the time value of your time to open and close the trades (WHICH IS VALUABLE). Plus, gotta pay uncle sam, so there's that headache. 

Now, at scale, when you're talking $1BN moving around, that's when this trade makes sense. The fund nets $1M per day on it. At that level, go for it, get those free micropennies, but for us down here scouring WSB, our time and money is better used yeeting 0DTE PLTR calls and pumping fuel into the GME moon machine.

Technical analysis suggests it will breakout 

Similarities have beendrawn to a pattern with Tesla a few months ago
The vaccine contains aspike protein called syncytin-1, vital for the formation of human placenta in women. If the vaccine works so that we form an immune response AGAINST the spike protein, we are alsotraining the female body to attack syncytin-1,which could lead to infertility in women of an unspecified duration.
Vix will be back in the low teens in a couple weeks and then we will just slowly melt up throughout 2021. Not too late to jump in. If you a boomer just long infrastructure stocks.
I dunno futures for election week pretty much gave everyone the sign to go. And futures for the crash told you the floor was falling out.

Why u mad bro? We have the toughest drinking water standards in the nation. Flint got a pretty generous settlement and they have clean water already now.

I know he said they don‚Äôt want to IPO but he was talking about being a public company in general when he said 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the case that we're in a slow-growth phase where the business still acts in this very predictable manner. We're more in the helter skelter expansion phase and will be, I think, continuing to operate in that mode for a few years.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt want to be public until they are a ‚Äústeady business‚Äù and the fact they are raising another round means that they will have no problem securing the private funding to do so. 

All of the evidence you have points to Ackman wanting Stripe not Stripe wanting to go public. The only evidence I‚Äôve seen is the job openings but some of those job openings would be required for a finance company of Stripes size even if they stay private. 

You can‚Äôt ignore the fund raising, the trolling, Ackmans statement that they aren‚Äôt ready, and Collisions statement that they aren‚Äôt ready. 

That‚Äôs why I sold
You miss the last couple weeks?

Abnb has a date for the ipo?
Good point

I do think she‚Äôs going to be POTUS sometime in the next 8years. Biden and trump both will die or be way to old for re-election and incumbent always have the upper hand. MM has had to have taken this into consideration. CH is still apart of the establishment, I think an AOC/Bernie (New Deal Camp) would be way more influential to the market. CH has deep ties to tech and Biden is strengthening her ties with WS. I agree it would be an impact but I think it would be short lived

You‚Äôre missing the point that the vw short squeeze occurred because two of the major share holders owned 90% of the shares and refused to sell. GME ownership is more spread out everyone would have to refuse to sell to it squeeze in the same way.
PFE prices should also spike around the 10th w/ FDA approval but if it's anything like what happened w/ EU approval, it's a narrow window.

Personally if it is -0.01 or better

So -0.00965 is ok to me whereas -0.0345 that would be too much theta

The bigger the negative theta the more decay as time passes.

I dont want my contract withering away, I want it to be worth significantly more even 6 months from now because it could spike up between now and then

Get a prescription for finasteride, around 1mg dose daily, thatll slow down your hair from actually falling out. Go buy some rogaine, foam or liquid 5%. That will promote growth.

Results wont happen over night but in 6-12 months I promise youll have a better head of hair then today

Sports bettors of WSB. Call me retarded but I‚Äôm going all in on Broncos ML. I believe in Drew üîí
And he signed up for internet, water and electric? or did guests have to crap in a bucket?
And then buy in after the price has doubled
He thought the premium for the call was $182, and that if he bought it and then sold it the next day somehow he'd be making $18k just like that

But the premium is not $182, that's per share

I don't know what math he was doing in his head but it wasn't a math based in reality
I saw on Twitter spy jumped over 370?! Green nation Monday?!
Apple is gonna drag SPY up by itself tomorrow don‚Äôt worry bulls
Startup company releasing their product to companies and the companies are reporting back that they like it. Would u like me to post again once they have a 1000 employees or do you want to go in early?

Honestly...  

I just buy turnkey rentals or , brrr if you‚Äôre handy enough with interior design. 

Interest rates are so fucking low it‚Äôs like easy printing 15-20% return on cash per year. (Pretty much 0 risk unless we get another 2008, but bailout is precedent).  

That or complete economic collapse and you get no tenants lol. Just pick a decent area that has job growth


/been investing in real estate since 2014. So I could be just on a bull run. But shrug whatever money is money.

This is a garbage quality post. No new info, just OP airing out his full two-incher

6k shares ~$22
If I don't know what I'm doing or the winners seem random but I want exposure to a sector, I'll pick an ETF like ARKG.  I can't tell who is going to have the big breakthrough, but I know several of these companies will have big enough wins where it will more than make up for the losers.  There is no amount of DD that I can do that will tell me which one of these is going to have the big breakthroughs.

However with tech I feel more sure footed.  I can generally tell who will win and who will lose.  An ETF for this makes no sense and will just water down my gains.  Figure out your strengths and play to them.
Buncha retards is what it is
I also choose this guys dead wife.
Hmm my comment about bulls keeping it in their pants because it might reverse aged very well
I agree. When currency is devalued assets rise. Stocks, real estate, gold, etc. They all go up.
So Flint residents drank poisoned water, got a little cash and a promise of having clean water ‚Äúsoon‚Äù or move? Water futures sound pretty cool actually. Nestle calls

Thursday

Only valued starting at 35 billion.  Going to skyrocket the first day.
Is that the Senate vote?
Then you sit tight for March's earnings.  Or reinvest in something else for the time being.   Between now and March, it's realistic to believe this will move 2-3% up each week.  For some, that's good enough to park their money for 3 months, for others, might be too slow.

I'm gunna say it one last time so all you autists can't say "why didn't anyone tell me about this company?" when the price goes up 300% in a year.

LGVW, received funding from Fidelity, Bill Gates and ARK invest bought in bigly on the 2nd of December at around $14... Not even the $10 nav price. 

So ask yourself, if $14 a share is good enough for one of the smartest investors out there, is $15.50 a share good enough for a scrub such as yourself?

Up $300k, then down $50k, then up $100k, then down $30k. Currently up, but not by nearly that much, considering the effort and stress.

Non meme answer, Japan's populations millenials are reaching prime spending age, and will prosper for 3-4 more years on generational spending. Same will happen to the US in 2024 a new bull saga.
When you sell a call, you‚Äôre selling the right to buy stock at a price.

So, If you own 100 shares of a stock you can sell a call that is ‚Äúcovered‚Äù by your own stocks. If they exercise the call, they‚Äôll be buying your 100 shares at 100*the options strike price.

It‚Äôs covered as opposed to selling a naked call. If a naked call is exercised you need to buy the 100 shares to sell to the exerciser - meaning infinite potential loss hence ‚Äúnaked‚Äù
Been eyeing them too. Chart looks prime for a break above 500 by EOY/mid-Jan
Agree. Maybe that‚Äôs what we should ask of the government? Instead all we hear is write us another check. $3T here and there. We‚Äôre becoming a country full of poor people and the government comes in at the tail end to help this and that. No one‚Äôs looking at the source of the problem.

It's an old technique that's been used for years. Big money still does it. The opportunity is most profitable at scale, without commission. The spread on the trade is so small now it almost doesn't make sense for retail traders. Could you do it and net a return? Sure. But you're hunting for pennies and nickels in a couch with this trade. 

1. Never could reliably profit off options #vega
2. SPY shares only and hopefully the MM don't front run you too hard and scalp your pennies before you can bank them

If so . . . 

Be my guest. 

You can squeeze more out of 8% probably 15-20% if you‚Äôre working in it like owning Subway or whatever. But it‚Äôs basically buying a job.

Regulations are the biggest reason companies can't innovate. Especially in the medical sector.  Especially big companies.  

If a company like Medtronics wanted to create a new, cheaper,  easy to use,  portable ventilator.  They would spend millions on market research,  design,  optimisation,  regulation compliance,  customer feedback,  brand recognition, profitability,  manufacturing,  resource supplying ect ect ect.  

Meanwhile a small engineering firm in Guildford, UK attached a pump bag to a children's snorkel, ran some tests on dummies,  got some doctors to assess it, then sold thousands of units to charities working in Asia and Africa without expensive equipment or access to reliable electricity and literally saved thousands of lives,  making hundreds of thousands of pounds in the process.  

Big things move slowly.  Innovation comes from small companies,  startups and the like.  Optimisation comes in later when the big companies get involved.

Spce will moon to 50 this week or next week. Mark it
One of Mar‚Äôs biggest problems is that it‚Äôs core has cooled and as such has a weak magnetic sphere protecting it unlike Earth. Any terraforming we do might not work because of it.

Any terraforming would require nukes more powerful than we have or more simply: slamming shitloads of Asteroids into the planet to transfer heat/energy to its core to get it jumpstarted again. 

If we than artificially cooled the surface fast enough, these astroids would provide huge metal deposits (this is how Earth got its metal deposits) and water since astroids also carry ice and the poles would have melted into vapor, which would than form oceans as it recondensed during an artificial cooling phase (again much like Earth own history except just over billions of years).

Though weather we actually do this or not is questionable. While it would give us another habitable planet if done right, by time we reach this point in technology (probably in the 2100‚Äôs or 2200‚Äôs since science goes at an increasing exponential rate) humanity will probably be relatively comfortable on Earth (birth rates get extremely low as countries develop and we will probably settle at around 12 billion humans and have low or negative growth) as our tech will have comfortably increased the planet‚Äôs carrying capacity as it always does.

Honestly terraforming planets will probably only need to be done as a showoff kind of thing as power blocs race in a kind of cold war.

Or will all be living in some kind of Hellish dystopia with Elon‚Äôs chips streaming us constant Tesla adds.

Beta is the benchmark. A beta coefficient is the volatility relative to the benchmark. There is "market beta" and "stock beta" if you will, the coefficient is the junior to the benchmark itself.

The easiest way to think of this is that your benchmark has a beta always equal to 1 but never more or less and anything you're comparing it to can have any value including 1.
Did you mean 14?
Yes 50 coming
Absolutely not.
Need that CRM pump to get going

Answering that question will take forever.

There‚Äôs a huge difference between Airbnb and amazon. I‚Äôm anti amazon and still use amazon because I‚Äôm a lazy fuck. I never use Airbnb because it hasn‚Äôt been cheaper than a hotel in 4 years and is loaded with scammers. Also, if my neighbor uses amazon, I don‚Äôt have to deal with the delivery guy coming to my door drunk at 4am speaking Italian.  There is far more reason to legislate against Airbnb and far more public support.

Before a market sell-off, John Hussman's right leg starts tapping unconsciously.

Well on a per vehicle basis they are worse but on a per person or per weight of cargo cars are probably far worse.

I‚Äôm not going to disagree you cited some prime examples of innovation and I happen to use a bunch of them. Just watched a concert on YouTube yesterday and it was wonderful. I can‚Äôt go to these things nowadays due to Covid. 

Now, speaking of Covid, remember when it first hit? The hospitals, doctors and citizens didn‚Äôt have and couldn‚Äôt buy protective gear. So much of what we use is all made overseas. 

We need ‚Äúold school‚Äù innovation where we make things. We need to manufacture tangible products so people can have real jobs with benefits, etc. 

We lost our manufacturing base. When the next virus comes, and it will, we will be helpless because of our supply chain.

Those of us who time the market and make 100% a month with our surgical trading, require the herd to mindlessly throw money into indices (all the stocks we're trading) at the current market price to maintain liquidity and momentum.

Yeah, good thoughts - thanks brother. I‚Äôm tempted to buy March calls near the money to keep me a little more liquid and then plan to exercise most if we get an announcement and it spikes. But think I‚Äôm going to be buying shares here as well with a massive accumulation goal - hopefully before we get word on the target (crossing fingers Ackman waits until Q1 to give me more time...). Plan to dump whatever spike I get in GME into this one - seems like a once in a decade opportunity to get in on this while it‚Äôs still under the radar. Can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate your post - such an exciting opportunity. Can‚Äôt believe that GME and this are happening at the same time - threading this needle with all my available capital is going to keep things interesting for me in the next few weeks. Cheers and good luck to you friend.

Thanks for detailed explanation and overview. It is probably worth more than entire 40 min of some Youtube ‚Äúguru‚Äôs‚Äù FX tutorial. I appreciate you taking your time to explain this.
Someone has probably brought this up to you I'm sure, but the only thing I think you'd want to pay attention to would be taxes.

I plan to reduce my exposure sometime this month for something similar to what you're saying, but I don't plan to be completely out of TSLA.

Edit:  And to clarify better this would be on my non-taxable account.

So the point of this second part is that one (or zero) of the positions will end up being exercised, but not the other one.  So pad your income just a bit at the end.  Correct?
The 800% is since inception over 25 years ago, not a regular profit. Not only would this be tiresome and repetitive, you probably wouldn‚Äôt make much of a profit to justify it between tax and paying commissions on every trade until recently.

Seems to have been a consistent winner. 
Question is:
Would you not have been better off just staying long especially considering the impact of all the commision youd have paid?
Only thing can think of is that you are theoretically taking less risk and could therefore add more leverage to this trade?
facts
I'm still holding SPY and TSLA puts (leaps) from March. Imagine if I just got calls instead?

Sometimes I find that when a stock plummets more than 25% from its highs it usually takes about 8-12 weeks to build a base and continue up. At least they are shares. God speed retard.
Thanks for reminding me about that Xilinx deal. I was planning on buying puts. Also that September drop off was likely caused by broad market sell off that analysts blamed on a technical correction.

It could pullback a bit I think but probably not all the way to September levels.

That Lisa Su interview with Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer will probably the catalyst to push to 100 in a week or two if we keep up this bullish trend.

Bro, I had the exact OPPOSITE experience.  
I put 3k in Robinhood Options, a friend advised me on investments he made a lot of money on.  
I lost almost all of my investment.  
And instead of being 100k richer, I am 100k in debt (unrelated, due to divorce and student loans)

AMC is great for them, keeps dropping to 3ish then bouncing to just under 5.  Also if you want dollar menu that isn't a weekly, look at stuff like RCL or AAL way out of the money stuff for popular dates (ie 1-15-21) All it takes is a good pop and travel stocks do that on a whim.

I'll be honest, after the SLV gang massacre in August I stopped touching meme stocks and started playing bounces and futures trends. (Check futures and play ETF/index based on what they show that day.)  I'm back up from being down to almost nothing, and now I'm militant about what I buy.  If the bid on the next lowest option is at least 1, you're in good shape.  The most common problem I have is not being able to get enough quantity of one I feel good about.

You gotta be able to spend money on yourself and what you want to do before retirement hits. Retirement is when you should be watching Netflix and youtube, now is when you should be taking vacations and working on your hobbies. If you wait until retirement you won't be able to do what you want to do. And what's the point of earning money if you aren't gonna use it? What'll make you happier, 7 digits in your account or actually realizing your dreams when you can still enjoy them?

Yup of course. If you are just going long on stuff long term you don't really need it. Its only if you want to swing trade or day trade. I've only done both this year and I'm up more than the cost of the market data but we are in a particularly lucrative bull market. I'm still trying to decide whether or not to keep it.

Over the next two years when the marker settles after covid and we can see the trajectory of the market more clearly I'll be doing long on ETFs with 50% leverage. 1.59% is worth it and it would take a 50% percent black swan event to get margin called. It's not impossible but it is unlikely.

Shorts are still betting on $0. They didn't cover at $2, and they didn't cover at $15. Shorts are betting on a Blockbuster end result and do not care about an ecommerce start up bro taking a majority stake.

> how can anyone predict how much a short squeeze will go?

It's very hard to predict how it will go. All we know is that the short interest provides ~65M shares of potential buyers. Look at TSLA and OSTK for a general comparison, although I believe GME will be much more explosive since TSLA and OSTK never hit >100% SI.

The GME play seems like one of the best plays this sub has ever sold. It‚Äôs predicated on buying shares which is inherently less risky and is predicated on a mass short squeeze triggered by a sudden price jump (company takeover or huge earnings). The speculative part of needing a great earnings seems par for the course for this sub while the downside is mitigated compared to the usual brain dead 5DTE .1 delta plays

Oh, if you want something bad enough there's *always* someone who will sell it to you. Their price might not be what you want, though. Remember in the example above where $WSB went up but the contracts were still worthless in the end? In that example you lose 100% of what you paid for the options. 

Options *can* be absurdly profitable, but they are also very dangerous. It's easy to lose everything, and that's hard to do with more traditional methods. If you're going to do this, do it with eyes wide open (it's very likely that you *will* lose money). My suggestion would be to get approved for spreads as quickly as possible and go with them until you start to get the hang of things.

Don't worry. 90% of this sub will never sell their shares/contracts even as the share price eclipses $100. They will spam "DIAMOND HANDS!!!!!! DON'T BE A PAPER HANDED PUSSY!!!!! GME $500 EOW" into the daily thread and on discord as the price peaks and falls back down from $100 to $12 in the span of a couple days. 

Most retards on here are completely incapable of doing anything but holding contracts until they expire worthless, no matter how much they are up at one point.

I'm in the same position as him.

It'd be better to sell deep ITM calls to ensure his current stash is taken off his hands then sell the deep ITM put at the $31 strike.

The volatility/time premium on that put nets .90¬¢ whereas the premium on the $31 strike call are only .30¬¢.

You will typically get more money for put premiums than call premiums.

Exactly - so if they merge at a discount to the valuation the public market would set then the share price will go up. It all depends on what % of the company they‚Äôre able to secure. I can‚Äôt find where I seen the rumour they might be getting 20%, but even say they pay $4bn for 8% and it‚Äôs worth $100bn, then our expected share price should be $40

I keep telling you guys, GME is the play.

\*Disclaimer- I will probably exit before earning because damn near every single stock has sold off after reporting this earnings season... but the risk is to the upside for GME so it will recover within 1 or 2 days IF it dips after earnings. Also, I will get back in regardless after earnings. I will only exit before earnings because my risk tolerance is very low... which says something if I am going long GME.

You had me at the TSLA hype vs. valuation part. I‚Äôm sold.
I encourage all readers to go look at the post history. I have had 3 main targets, all of which I still own and provide analysis on 1) MAC 2) FNMA and 3) PSTH

Please go ahead and sift through the commentary. On PSTH, I am long. I trust Ackman and the investor list he's accumulated. I also subscribe to a lot of the arguments made by YOLO. I am leaning towards this being Stripe but like many of you, I am ready for any outcome and again a long term tontine hold.

I do believe the other commenter is correct in saying that there is a great short play opportunity here whether it be commons or options. Its ultimately up to the individual investor to review the info and make best decisions based on that and the premium to NAV they are paying for. Much more successful investors than us have paid a premium. That's one of my contentions here.

Anyways, focus again on the signal and not the noise. Character assassination based on incorrect reporting of my public posts is most certainly noise. Shame on you for that and for insinuating I am part of a scheme.
Will be a good long term play

Haha, I'm in at the same price point.

Here's what I did.

Sold my shares at a loss (should've just sold a deep ITM call) and then sold weekly $31p to collect $90 profit.

I will continue to do this for the next 6-8 weeks and will have made back my losses with premiums and if PLTR recovers, I'll make around $900 per put I've sold on top of the premiums.

I don't know why I hadn't considered this before, but I'm going to start doing this to ALL my long stocks that have weeklies. 

Just going to sell on Friday and sell puts with strikes 3-5% above actual stock price.

If you were wanted to sell the stocks, you'd have used a stop loss so if you're going to diamond hand it, at least use the capital you devote to it to earn income on your wagers.

really?  over 3000 new dead people the other day.  and deaths lag case surges.  so case surges today WILL give you death surges 2 weeks or so down the road.  And increased hospitilizations aren't a big deal when you go from 90% capacity to 98% capacity.  But when you go from 98% capacity to 105% capacity the system starts breaking down.  patient care delays and neglect turn into real bad outcomes.  patients OTHER than covid patients.  you know all the other sick ass people that hospitals take care of but can't get a bed despite having just had a massive heart attack or stroke or their bloodstream is full of bacteria and they're in septic shock... they get to wait in the waiting rooms or in hallway beds.

Gap ups are fun and all Sunday evening but I'm ok with no gap ups because this market always seems to need to close them at some point. I'd rather not have a selloff during normal trading hours, even if it does open and close well above 3700.

Honestly holding UVXY for 1-2 years is a terrible idea. Value decay is going to make your investment worthless.

how can we avoid this upcoming wave of evictions and foreclosures? the government delayed it from dec 31 to Jan 31 i assume to see where the vaccine will be by then, they might do that again a couple of times, the one month delay move, but that‚Äôs just delaying the pain not avoiding it
yeah, it doesn't get stressed enough that the system is actually brittle.  It has a little wiggle capacity for surges and then it gets overrun and all hell breaks loose.  There are patients OTHER than covid patients and then where do you put the heart attacks, strokes, septic patients etc.  Going from 150,000 new cases a day to 230,000 new cases a day doesn't necessarily mean as much as say going from 230,000 new cases to 240,000 new cases if 240,000 cases ends up breaking the fucking system.

A lot of strategies work better with less capital since you would affect the price too much when buying and selling otherwise. For example, small guy joe might buy 10% of his portfolio at a cost basis of 100, but a big fish might have to pay 110 for a 10% stake in their portfolio since they‚Äôll bring the price up. This matters because if the stock is worth 112 then you‚Äôll have a much bigger return for the smaller portfolio.

Thank you for the detailed response. I had some profits on Macy's but I was trading for short time frames, holding only 1-2 days. It brings like $1,000 but nowhere close what you got xD

I think you have a solid thought process, but one issue for me is the time it takes for such a reversal to happen (I know people expecting that on GE for several years now). Even if they have good earnings and all that, sometimes the market doesn't respond to it. I think that's always a hidden difficulty in trading depressed stocks. Again, well done!

Not really. It's like people have forgotten that the market doesn't just go up. 

This person bet on a stock tripling or quadrupling in 1.5 years. That's a crazy bet. Even if you had good reason to believe in the stock, you should never expect a stock to triple in 18 months. 

And if you did that with your whole life savings, well, you'd be an idiot, or be following advice of this sub.

CALLS on PFE & BNTX, also long reopening; airlines, cruises, hotels, restaurants etc.  Then PUTS on quarantine stocks; PTON, FVRR, CVNA shit like that.  However once the news is out pull the calls on PFE & BNTX from there hard to see they could go any higher for a while.   Next week do it all over again with MRNA. While you‚Äôre at it also buy Jan - March Calls on AZN and or JNJ they will announce their own vaccine info soon (and once they do short the fuck out of Inovio).

most of my money is in blue chips with good and growing dividends, as well as large mutual funds.  I have enough extra to buy shares on flyers so I dont feel left out.  (NIO, PLTR etc....)   Im not looking to hit homeruns...just singles and an occasional double.  Ill take a walk or a hit by pitch.  I cant mess this up...I dont have enough time to make it back if I lose everything.  I understand both sides...and neither is 100% correct.

Ok looks like I'm buying BB at 8.55 and will put a sell limit at like 9.35 or something. Hopefully I can flip that stock and get in on ABNB at the release.

>Yeah, they want to protect their well regulated hotels and people who work there. 

No,  they want to protect the well regulated hotels and the rich people who own them.  As opposed to the small time landlords hoping to make a quick buck by renting their parents apartment on ABNB. 

>The US excels at taking existing business models and modifying them a bit so the founders make it big and the risk is shifted to the others. 

The US excels at finding an industry,  and making it easier for the average citizen to enter it.  Twitter and journalism.  Snapchat and pornography. YouTube and entertainment.  UBER and taxis.  ABNB and hotels.  Robinhood and day trading.  The innovation is bringing it to the masses.  

UBER has famously never made a profit. The company is running at a loss to try and make UBER synonymous with lift sharing.  In the meantime the shareholders are subsidising the cost of journeys for the end user.  UBER drivers are happy,  they can make a decent salary and drive and own a car tax free.  UBER passengers are happy,  they get highly trusted journeys below market rates.  

Everyone wins except the shareholders who are holding shares that aren't worth anything.  The winners are the ones who sold out at IPO.

Jersey Mike's and Jimmy John's I would assume have higher growth rate but Subway is everywhere, even in the smallest towns because the franchise fee is one of the lowest.

I agree, I just have personally used their service and communication is a huge problem with bidders and most bid on all projects even if they aren't qualified... I have since been using a private company that sifts through qualified people first and then they personally match you with a person. 

More expensive, but it actually works. FVRR seems like the wild wild west of freelancing. That was my personal experience. If they changed their vetting process, then I understand.

Otherwise, I feel like people will use the service, be disappointed, and then go somewhere else to outsource.

He's talking about futures. How many chromosomes you got that you didn't get that?
When you preface your comment with I‚Äôm dumb and poor then follow it with a strategy you think could work, you answer your own question.
Yah, the commenter is full of shit.  Beta is a measure of correlation with the market.  Mathematically, it‚Äôs the covariance of return vs. market return, divided by the variance of the market return.  It‚Äôs a number that is generally between -1 and 1, but can exceed those limits.  If beta for a financial instrument is zero, its price moves completely randomly with respect to the market.  If it‚Äôs unity, then it‚Äôs perfectly correlated.  If beta > 1, it means that the price moves more than proportional to the market (e.g, leveraged ETFs).  If beta is negative, then the price moves inversely to the market.
Well, unless you‚Äôre AMZN
Chewy. Holding since Thursday, selling on Monday afternoon
Meanwhile, I‚Äôm waiting for Fidelity to not allocate any of the shares I requested at the offering price.

Why
As other people have said - they've made some incredibly stupid moves, the management style of The Brothers Wu stinks, and all it took was a Citron tweet in December 2017 to knock their dicks in the dirt for 3 years.  November 30, 2017 high of $13.95, then dropped down into the $3s, $2s, and briefly the $1s over the next three years.  


\[Shit, even the 11/30/2017 high was off the ATH of $16.15 on March 13, 2014.  They haven't been able to get it up since then - it's been all downhill from there.\]  


Their 10 year chart is all over the map - it's a fucking roller coaster.    


Still, I think Himax may actually be a decent automotive play via their partnership with Lumotive, as well as some of their other sensor tech they'll be rolling out.  


It really doesn't matter, because some people BELIEVE this.  True believers will make this one worth jumping in and out of.  

&#x200B;

Because of the violent swings it's about to start experiencing after a 3-year hiatus, it's again poised to become a trader's and adrenaline junkie's delight.  There's going to be money to be made off of it.  


\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

TL;DR - Follow the Wyckoff Method, you'll make out like a bandit.
I‚Äôve had two different family friends who turned a room into an air bnb exclusive thing and then the city shut it down a few months later. Sucks and is happening all over the US.

Did you get in at $45?  INTC was screaming buy me and hold me tight when it hit $45.  It sure as hell isn't rocketing anywhere.  Hard cap of $60 at most, but no way it was staying at $45 and not going right back to $50.  Will probably bounce $50-55 now for a while.

I made 20k last week off of 1500 playing XOM and XLE. Keep an eye on XOM. XLE and XOM are nearly a dollar apart, but XOMnis usually many dollars ahead of XLE. Look at their june 8 prices. xle 46, xom 54.
Why? Everything has been bullish this weekend unless you get bad vaccine and stimulus don‚Äôt expect to go below 360.
THIS IS NUTS.

Hi Im dumb and poor

Are we expecting GME to rise up faster than PLTR would? Cause im thinking of pulling most of my shared in PLTR and putting it in GME to get some more money i can invest.
Where can I have a look at that, I'm too retarded to google the right words.

Yeah, I fucked up saying BB. Didn't realize how big the run up was on Friday. Need to let that drop about 30% first down to around $6. Once it does I'm going for Jan 2023 $10c. Emergence of EVs I'm hoping will give them a little run up on profits, since about 20% of their revenue is from EV software currently. 2 years for them to sort out their shit and build a profit margin comparable to other software companies.


Now that you made me think about it I'm prob not going to do it. I was going full retard, I should have never went full retard . Some more long PSTH contracts I guess.

There are multiple ways to make money. Someone swing trading stocks could tell another person everything he does, but that person may never be able to turn a profit. Buffet makes money going uber long. Others make money going short. There's no wrong way to make money, you just have to try something until you understand how it works and become consistent.

I‚Äôm retarded, but in a zero interest rate environment and stocks being basically the only way to outpace inflation, that ought to create tremendous upward pressure in the medium term even as the fundamentals of the economy remain weak. There‚Äôs simply nowhere for the money to go, and there‚Äôs more in circulation than ever. Perversely, the worse shit gets, the more stonks should go up because your money is slowly eroding in your checking acct.
Same reason
The price accounts for the news.  So how does keeping up on news gives anyone an advantage?  Only a crystal ball or a correctly timed guess will help you beat the market and how can one do that consistently over a long period of time?

Aal and ccl pullback next week? Hmm
why is it harder to get a bigger return with more money?
Absolutely agree, if I had to guess we get some type of predictably bad news about corona next week and this consolidates close to 38 on the volatility swing.  That should be when you start licking your chops to enter

Pre futures ... think about what that means lol
Maybe I read wrong. Eps of -0.56 will be the end of the fiscal year number I believe. But even -0.81 isn't deadly by any means. Especially considering new console sales won't be reported in this er. I still think it's gonna be a beat. I also think an earnings beat would be perceived well, but that's debatable I guess.

You toss and turn as Elon gently rubs your shoulders. "You seem a little tense" says Elon, as you look at your bank account. Your phone shows $107 left to your name. You think to yourself while Elon rubs you down, you pull open Robin Hood, type in TSLA. Leaps $900 JAN 2023' are only $1 you can afford 1 leap. This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be. He says "U, for 'you'" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.
  
  
All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, "we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase  options with a $25,000 barrier to entry."
  
You start weeping aloud,  you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, "what's wrong my little X'‚àöœÄ3?"   
  
Suddenly you wake, you're in a pool of sweat, at first you panic about the new options policy, then you're filled with relief realizing that options aren't restricted it was all a dream.   
  
You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200,000% gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $900 and realize the options are actually $20 each. The best you can do is $900 TSLA weekly expiring around Christmas.
  
In a slight fit of despair you try to remember the feeling of Elon rubbing your cheek, and rub one out onto your stomach, then roll over back to sleep. A single tear rolls from your eye into your waifu pillow.   
  
^^^YOLO ^^you ^whisper.

There is no extrinsic value if no one willing to buy it. Trust me, I'll sell them when I can, but because they are not as easy to dump as OTM monthlies or weeklies, sometimes it just makes sense to exercise them. Imagine if you bought a 7.5c BB 2023 and BB runs up to $30 and you really want to cash in - do you think you will find a buyer? Same scenario, different strike: lets say you buy a 2023 15c, and BB never makes it past 10, and you decide to sit on it, you loose more money to theta because there is no intrinsic value to the contract. If that was an ITM leap, there is less extrinsic value to loose over time so the penalty for holding is lowered.

You might not have issues with a company like AAPL because of haw active the options chains are, so that is an exception to consider as well. 

The nice thing about ITM options is the intrinsic value, and because the cost is always less than buying 100 shares, its an easy way to leverage your account over time.

I'm a little hesitant to sell covered calls in case that's the time it decides to squeeze. I'm thinking about selling weekly puts around 12-13, making the premium or getting exercised to buy more at that price.
That I agree with. What I disagree with is policy and government rule based on something like genetics. The ability to abuse, manipulate or misinterpret the data is far more dangerous than any benefit in it's use.

If you guys like listening to confirmation bias that stonks only go up check out the work of Mike Green. He has been arguing for a long time that stonks go up due to the prevalence of passive investing in the major indices and money given to portfolio managers with the only criteria of ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, price be damned. Fundamentals matter to a point but inflows are incredibly significant.

Of course he makes a more compelling argument then my dumb-dumb synopsis because he is a lot smarter and a shit load richer than me.

Vaccines are rolling out already. Ik for my state NY we are going to vaccinate first responders immediately then move on from there. Pharmacies like CVS are going to be the main hub for distribution most likely.  The stimulus deal although doesn‚Äôt affect airlines directly, its just a positive outlook for the future. And usually when the market is positive most sectors see an increase.

Fed will only raise interest rates if economy is doing particularly  well or if inflation is insanely high (see the Volcker shock).

What's the play if it's Stripe? Are we all just selling when the price pops from merger announcement? Or is this like a long term play, maybe years and years if it's indeed Stripe?   


Side question: How do you know when to get out of a position? Because the longer you hold the more value it will get, but if you don't sell you'll never realize the value.
insane even for this timeline
The guy getting roasted was an equity research analyst at bloomberg dipshit so I'm pretty sure he's not retarded like us to lose it all in one go dumbass
Every comment you write sounds like you have autism. Typical retard that thinks they are smarter than everyone but is so autistic they can't grasp simple concepts. Look at your post history, you ask dumb questions. Go back to posting about how sex is over rated you dumb assburger. The only reason you think sex is overrated is because only ugly trannies will fuck your autistic ass.
Hmmm, maybe this is why I've been banned from having sex by my wife.
That CEO looks like a normal nerd, not autistic. Does he has some vision, like colonize Mars?

A lot of funds, especially smaller ones, are not declared and are not available for the average person. It‚Äôs also harder to beat the market with more capital so some funds don‚Äôt accept more.

Typed this up in reply to another comment that was deleted.. think it can stand on its own though:

Most important factor to remember is with investing you are either too early or too late.

There is really no theoretical "perfect time" - that would be insider trading unless just blind luck.

No short/put position is gonna start tanking right away unless you are chasing, and no momentum play is gonna break to the upside right away, again, unless you are chasing.
what if it opens at 2X or 3X over IPO price?
It‚Äôs a pump and dump for sure
Only a matter of time tbh
This time last year I was at a kickass Bulleit Bourbon [event. ](https://twitter.com/pepeforthewin/status/1335707618870964225?s=21)

Chick I was talking to dropped me off because she had a wedding to attend. So I was solo. 

When she came to pick me up she was drunk and pissed because I got invited to the ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù room. I showed her pictures and she was upset for no fucking reason. 

I can‚Äôt count the number of nights I‚Äôve had that start out awesome, then end in tragedy because of basically nothing.

don't listen to bears, you'll be wrong sometimes: if you listen to bears trying to "help" you or scare you out of your position, you won't just be wrong sometimes, you'll be wrong most of the time

for each goddamn opinion you listen to you're going to be more wrong:

\- your judgment is wrong sometimes

\- my judgment is wrong sometimes

so if I'm wrong 1/2 the time, and you're wrong 1/2 the time, and you take my advice into consideration, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 therefore you'll be wrong 100% of the time

There's 2 sources that MAY bring the market down. How much i don't know. Government shut down AND no stimulus (has to be a direct payment). Shit could be catastrophic
Best advice I can give if you're starting out is to just focus on 1-2 tickers at first. Get to know them, how they move, what makes them pump and dump, average volume etc until you know them like the back of your hand. It'll help you know when to diamond hand your plays or sell, when to jump in, buy the dip and all that stuff you need to do to be a successful trader.

AirBnB is not and will never be 50% the valuation of Tesla. I can rent out my house but I can‚Äôt build a Tesla. 

I am sure cavemen were renting out caves and holes in the ground. AirBnB is just another exchange site for renters and small-time landlords. There are already sites that do that all over the world. 

Who can disrupt them? Amazon possibly. Otherwise, Hotels. They can easily switch their offerings to do what AirBnB does. They already have the infrastructure. 

There is no IP. Oh, and residents will always fight these short term rentals located in non-commercial zones. People want to live in peace and quiet. What‚Äôs the upside for them when strangers start pulling at night? Robbers? Who knows?

I bought these on the last day of December futures contract trading on Comex on November 24th. From watching the past 4-5 months the shorts push gold down hard the last day the following month trades. Then it gradually rebounds. So I figured the same thing would happen this month and it did. GDXJ bottomed that day around $47.92, I rolled the entire position into this week because the premiums for ITM calls are very cheap and I think with stimulus rumours the GDXJ could rally another 4-8% before the congress vote on Thursday.

London,  New York,  Barcelona,  Merseille, Rome,  Florence,  Venice,  Madrid,  Monaco have all either passed legislation specifically against ABNB or have legislation on the table.  

Sure,  buy shares for short term gains.  But if this shit was long term profitable,  it wouldn't be going public.  Buy options for the initial growth.  But after 1 year of trading,  get out.  Its not going anywhere long term.
Interesting opinion on VIX that differs from what I've been seeing even on the smallest red dildos
It‚Äôs simple, I buy more puts in addition to the ones I got on Friday. This shit can tank just as quickly as it rises in a few days.
Nice DD. Good retail play that I never even considered. I'm considering the 1/15 $35/40 call spread for 3.20. If the market drops I can buy back the short call if desired ‚Äî but if they just instituted a dividend and are in great financial shape heading into the upcoming vaccine rollout, I don't see how this can go down meaningfully.
I bought on Monday and held as it went down below 18, and then below 17.

Shares are cheap right now. Its a solid company and actually HAVE an approved treatment.  They're backed by bristol myer squibb if i remember right. 

Calls r cheap as well. My personal target is 60 buuuuuuut, market is quite weird right now and saturated with bubbles an noone can tell what is about to happen.

Almost everyone lost their focus and only gazes at pfizer or mrna... and shitty chinese fraud commie stonks, like there are no other. So its a cheap buy either way if you ask me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Tldr: BUY EVERYTHING
Thank you for this, this has just made my day so much better.
Agreed on the late part, was too busy bleeding PLTR to give a proper writeup hence my mentioning we are likely in for a market cool off week and to wait for a red day to get options.  KSS has been my recovery whale pick from Day 1 and I lost a good deal trying to play them too early.   Last quarters earnings convinced me KSS would stretch to 40 by end of year (they were $24 at the time).  It happened 4 weeks earlier than I expected and has continuing momentum and is generating the cash to keep it going.
money launders (e.g. the crinimals and the wealthy) were upset that all their secrets are being revealed and threatened netflix.

I sold cash covered 12/4 22P for almost fucking $2.0 a piece, that IV (150-180%) was fucking delicious
Might buy leaps on airlines while they‚Äôre still cheap, debit spreads on SPY and QQQ. Pretty bullish on 1Q 2021
buy the dip and buy the üöÄ before it moons
Don't sell covered calls if you're not comfortable selling your shares. I sold nio at 19. So it goes 

But premiums are what I mean. Iv makes juicy premium. I've returned 68%in 6 months on primarily gaining premium, couple delta plays, small smattering of fd's. I realize it's not always going to be so easy, guess I'll just be making less money on premium when such a day passes

Thoughts on EEM? I've made decent money with it in the past month and rolled some of it into 1/15/21 53 and 55 calls. I did it because of the sheer inflow into those strikes, but that index has never been at those levels before. Ride it or dump it after about 20% profit?

I think I might keep risking something like 25% on short term calls every week so when the rug pull does come I'm not terribly leveraged.

Fair, doubling her money considering the market growth is nothing impressive, but everything she said in her post was accurate advice to give new traders.
Credit gives you the ability to be almost 100% in equities. 

When you need to deploy a lot of cash immediately, you can use credit and then pay it off by selling equities or wait until next paycheck. Someone on bogleheads did an analysis on this strategy and it turns out that 100% equities beats having an emergency fund. Even in a worst case scenario such as market crash + losing your job, the person who had their entire networth in VTI/VTSAX still outperformed the person who kept an emergency fund.

Yea theres 3 vaccines out right now and getting shipped to every hospital in the states. Futures are officially in bullgang mode
Depends on starting price. If it's low enough, people will buy and hold which effectively brings up the cost such that even if it does dip, there is minimal loss.
Lol.. no

Prices for copper have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore, the main ingredient of steel, is one of the best-performing assets in 2020. Other raw materials, such as aluminum and zinc, have added roughly 15% since the end of September and 40% or more since mid-May.

Wrong. Pre-split strike would've been 680, so put this into ToS: .TSLA210115C680. Adjust your time frame and look at the screenshot he posted below showing some purchases on 7/26/19 for 1.09, and your ToS will match up perfectly.

Even though it cost more than what his average cost shows, keep in mind the split put him (her?) into a new strike, and average cost also would've been divided by 5. Math works out.

TLDR:  

Now I know why that blog is called seeking alpha.
I‚Äôm going to dump GME tomorrow and take a little profit because I‚Äôm not confident in it and I don‚Äôt care if I miss out. I‚Äôm going get to sell my ERIC leaps at breakeven because there will always be another dip to buy. I‚Äôm going sell my LLNW shares and leaps and just a hold a small position after my jan puts get assigned. I‚Äôm hoping for a major catalyst to pay big on this one but it‚Äôs not worth risking more than 2% of my portfolio on a small cap who‚Äôs going up against FSLY. I have a number of small lotto plays that I‚Äôll be dumping as well because it just takes my attention away from core positions.

I‚Äôm going to focus on AMD, DKNG, FEAC and NIO because those have the best odds of actually coming in over the next 3 months.

I just feel they will get back to $9.50-10 soon. The profit taking should be over by now and has held up fairly well. But that‚Äôs about it. No real idea just a hunch. I have a 100 shares. It could take until spring for it üöÄ. I don‚Äôt mind holding fcel for a few months.

GME puts are sounding good. WSB is not smarter than BlackRock.
If you guys don't already own one you should really get a money tree. My portfolio is literally up 250% since I've brought it into my office a month ago.

I've had it through some rough times but looking back most of my success has been when it was in the room I spent the most time in. Attention is its key.
Negative 500% is easy.

Sell naked calls against TSLA.
I don‚Äôt see much risk if I‚Äôm being honest with you
I'm balls deep in GME and ETHE please tell me it will be ok
Its how I play ITM leaps. You can buy OTM leaps and hope to sell the contracts, but the volume for most of these is very low making them hard to sell once you own them. I assume I wont be able to, so I buy atm or slightly itm leaps with the intention of exercising them. Its an easy way to add leverage long term.

Yeah, less risk. Of course they come at a premium, because greater chance of being ITM at expiration. Best to buy on a negative day I'm guessing, that way you get in when premium is down. I am by no way an expert at this myself either, just some things I've observed.

It is because I am an individual that I pursue my own values. And one of my value is that I want there to be more people like me with similar personality to continue to exist. _Passion is but a slave to reason._ Maybe you can see how much decisions are driven by evidence.

AND LOL, I know I have issues, but I believe there are also good parts of me that **I really want** to be passed on. See _mutational load_. That's the whole point of sexual reproduction, because it randomly selects 1 of the 2 copies of each genes in you to pass on. There's literally no loss, except my time in college from getting extra lottery tickets.

If you also don't know, literally everyone has issues because genetic replication are flaky. But some people clearly have less issues.

Yea no sweat, I'm no expert either fwiw.

On 3) Basically yes, another buyer can just slide right in. You've sold the contract to open, and there had to be a buyer on the other end for that to happen, but you and that buyer are not linked until expiry.

Correct on the last part. 

Depending on how far out your expiration is you could try and buy back your contract and sell another one for a favorable outcome.

Like, you sell a CC expiring in 1/15/20 for $5 per share. Stock takes a hit and that Call is now worth $2.5. Buy it back with half your collecting premium, lock in $250 in gains and sell one closer to ITM for more premium ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Not investment advice btw I'm a fuckin retard

**[Antiviral drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral drug)**

Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used for treating viral infections. Most antivirals target specific viruses, while a broad-spectrum antiviral is effective against a wide range of viruses. Unlike most antibiotics, antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen; instead they inhibit its development. Antiviral drugs are one class of antimicrobials, a larger group which also includes antibiotic (also termed antibacterial), antifungal and antiparasitic drugs, or antiviral drugs based on monoclonal antibodies.

It is a [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) of the synthetic [nucleoside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside) derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, and exerts its antiviral action through introduction of copying errors during viral RNA replication.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molnupiravir#cite_note-pmid31645453-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molnupiravir#cite_note-pmid31945316-2) Activity has also been demonstrated against [coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) including [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS), [MERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERS) and [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molnupiravir#cite_note-pmid32253226-3)

The drug was developed at [Emory University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University) by the university's drug innovation company, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE). It was then acquired by Miami-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, who later partnered with [Merck & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co.) to develop the drug further.

GA senate runoff - if both are democrat wins, senate goes 50/50 and VP Kamala Harris is the tie breaker.

Correct me if I'm wrong.
First rule of options trading, never actually multiply anything by 100.  It just makes the numbers bigger and harder.    

If you are fairly certain it will drop to around 300, you can buy a 310p and sell a 300p.  that way if it ends at or below 300 you make 10 dollars.     
The difference between 310 and 300 p right now is about 5 bucks so you could double your money.

You might wanna look at forward P/E, and historical P/E. Because these are value financial stocks, they are likely not going to have much higher P/E I believe. Another thing to look for I believe is the Tangible Book Value for financial firms.

You can sell anytime you like before or on the expiration date.
As the stock price gets closer to $300, the call options become more valuable. On the other hand, if the price doesn't change, with each day passing the options lose a little bit of value.

Yes it is free money if it's headed in your direction, just not as much gain to be had.
Same boat, same thoughts on Monday. I'm converting my expensive ITM calls to new, cheaper higher strike calls to preserve more gains.
It sounds like you don‚Äôt know fully how covered calls work...

When your selling a covered call and it gets close to expiration and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs out of the money so you have gained value on the premium

You then buy back the call - buy to close - and get the difference from what you sold and what you had to pay to buy it back

If you let it expire you would collect the whole premium

The buyer doesn‚Äôt have to do anything because you‚Äôre not tied to some specific person there just needs to be someone willing to sell for you to buy it back

Plenty of dry humor and optimistic humor towards his dire situation. In regards to convincing him to strap himself in essentially a chair on a rocket, there was this line:

"¬†[After hearing he has to take the top off of the Mars Ascent Vehicle] I know what they're doing. I know exactly what they're doing. They just keep repeating "go faster than any man in the history of space travel", like that's a good thing. Like it'll distract me from how insane their plan is. Yeah, I get to go faster than any man in the history of space travel, because you're launching me in a convertible. Actually it's worse than that, because I won't even be able to control the thing. And by the way, physicists, when describing things like acceleration do not use the word "fast". So they're only doing that in the hopes that I won't raise any objections to this lunacy, because I like the way "fastest man in the history of space travel" sounds. I do like the way it sounds... I mean, I like it a lot. [pauses] I'm not gonna tell them that."

I'm copy pasting some who says it's Subway, which makes sense:

&#x200B;

 

Former CEO of Burger King that sold BK to Ackmans SPAC Justice Holdings in 2012 is now the CEO of SUBWAY.

In Nov, 2019 he became the CEO and brought in other executives from Burger King.

Subway suffered from decreased revenues from the pandemic and Ackman can get a good deal.

It looks like Ackman wants to do Burger King SPAC all over again. This time it is SUBWAY.

Look, Ackman said predictable cashflow model, and Subway's 8% royalty from the revenues is very predictable.

I doubt Ackman will be going after Tech unicorns which are trading at ATH multiples and cannot get a good deal. Why would he get Stripe at 100 billion market cap?

Everything is pointing to Subway.

Cidsey became CEO of Subway in 2019 and Bill IPO $psth in 2020.

Also the founder of Subway had passed away and his family do not want to run this business.

Edit: Yolo will never reply with counter argument because he thinks anything other than Stripe is impossible. Kid, please grow up and do a better DD.

3) Re-apply thermal paste properly. You'll need to look up how to disassemble and apply it's quite easy to do.

PFE is more conservative but you won't see major gains or losses. BNTX is higher risk and higher reward.

Ill use an analogy. 

Healthcare is a system. Much like the stockmarket. Sometimes systems get overwhelmed. When they do, things in society more broadly can immediately be impacted. Harken back to watching banks fall like dominoes in 2008. Remember how it took years to recover and how millions of families were financially ruined or harmed. and thats just *money* .. you're talking about a system that deals with *lives*.   Have you ever wondered, "I never get sick, why do I even have health insurance? Why do hospitals even exist?" 

The answer to these questions is because: There are other people besides you. And hospitals are operating normally at full capacity. And if 9 million people all had a heart attack tomorrow, you'd see them collapse, alongside the EMS system, due to overload, along with the police system, due to civil unrest bc grandmas dying in the parking lot while other people are inside getting treated, along with the judicial system because of the backlog, along with the fire dept because they manage EMS and the civil unrest leads to arson. Then the NG gets deployed but I'll be darned, their parents are dying too, and they dont give a fuck about doing their jobs when their parents are dying in the parking lots. 

Thats why its a big fucking deal. Because it risks the very premise of ongoing peace that your ass relies upon to trade.
They don't but they do give a fuck about they're money in the stock market

#3 is interesting, for some reason I thought the contract sold stayed with the buyer either until they sell or expire. But if they sell another buyer can just slide right in? 

And the reason why I wouldn‚Äôt collect 2x premium on the same contract switching hands is because my collateral stays the same?
All over that juicy little money machine
Well options aren't available for 5 days anyways, if there's a dip I'll wait. But  are there other concerns? I for example I think that it will double in a year and the IPO price is 100. Is the bext way to capitalize on that to buy something like 250$ 1 year calls? Not sure what price I should target..

Looking forward catalysts such as positive ERs, potential investor activism or acquisition and other neutral to good news and announcements are expected to perpetuate and accelerate the upward trend. If the news is it will for sure get interesting. Patience pays.

You should do some more reading on your own but

1) You'd be buying to close a covered call

2) When you buy to close, you pay the going rate for the option currently. What ypu collected in premium when you sold to open- the premium you pay to buy to close = your net profit.

3) It doesn't matter what the guy on the other side does, unless it goes ITM and you get excercised. The covered call you sold could change hands 10000x between the time you sold it and expiration.

I'm very bullish on JKS. If you look at their news for Q3, they supplied additional 126 MW of modules to Chile, 611 MW to Vietnam, signed contract for 1GW to Shanghai, revised forecast to supply from 22 to 25 GW by 2022, improved efficiency of modules. Q3 looks to be a sure winner, all solar companies beat earnings in Q3; JKS will definitely not be an outlier.

Hey Mods while you‚Äôre at it, could I be crowned JWN King?
No I don‚Äôt think so, I‚Äôm just trying to close the CC and profit the premium, but I‚Äôm not sure if I have to wait until the contract expires or if I collect all of the premium as soon as I sell. 

But If that‚Äôs the case what would be the point in holding till expire? So I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs wrong

I think the buyer has to agree to close the contract and give up the premium after I sell to close?

100k isn‚Äôt enough for 100 shares, so that‚Äôs not an option.
People have preferences but the data is pretty clear. Over time index investing, specially the S&P500 is better than any other strategies. Even timing strategies for the S&P are worse than just riding the market, and putting money every month.

if you pick the stocks yourself, you will pick the wrong stocks at the wrong time, and won't have a better annualised return than the market. There are very few people in history that beat the index for 10 years, and the number drops with every consecutive year.

If you invest in a fund, and "experts" pick the stocks, they will charge you 2 and 20, so they will have to get a 15% so you get 10%.

Most professional investors and institutions fail to beat the market every year.

Over 30 years, the average is much much higher for the index investor.

do you want to be a Nero or a John?
You need to let them expire to get full premiums.

With that said, you can often close covered calls a few minutes before the market closes on Friday for very low cost.

If you close your covered calls early (buy to close) you‚Äôre buying someone else‚Äôs contract, not the contract you sold to the initial buyer (theoretically, it can be but it‚Äôs a slim chance).

You‚Äôre just transferring the covered call liability from you to another seller.

Why note BABA? Its been beaten down much more and has a more recognizable name
U open a sell contract with premium at $10 and expires Friday. You get $10 at this moment 

If stock goes up your premium does too, it‚Äôs now worth $15, you can buy to close, but you would actually lose 5 bucks 

If stock goes down your premium does too. It‚Äôs now worth 5 dollars. U can buy to close and you made essentially 5 dollars, could have rode to exp and gained 10 total, but this was faster

In either scenario if the option expires worthless you receive whatever the initial premium was. You can expedite this if stock drops and your premium approaches zero faster. 

Once the contract is out of your hands your profit/loss ends on it. Whatever they do is only affecting them at this point.

Lol look at GoPro's stock
OK, so let's say I buy a share of $WSB at $10. If the value of the share goes from $10 to $11 then you make $1. If it shoots up to $100 then you make $90. What Stockpile is going to do is buy some shares of $WSB when people start wanting it. Then they make up this fake asset called, "fractional shares". These fractional shares represent partial ownership of $WSB, in that their value is relative whatever $WSB is doing. They're fake, though, because they only have value inside of Stockpile.

Basically, Stockpile is the same as owning shares with more serious. So let's talk about that guy with the TSLA. For simplicity sake, let's go back to $WSB. A call option (AKA Zoomie) is an agreement that you may buy 100 shares  between now and some point in the future for a given price. Let's say you buy an $11 call on $WSB expiring at the end of January. Let's say it costs $0.01 per share. That means you pay $1 per contract you're buying. For the same $10 you payed for one share, you can buy 10 contacts of 1/31 $WSB $11c.

Now, let's say $WSB goes up to $11 (or even goes down). Your call lets you buy for $11, but why would you do that? You can get it on the open market for $11 (or less), plus you spent all your money buying this call so you can't even if you wanted to. 

But... if $WSB goes to $100? Well your 10 contracts let you control 1,000 shares. And you have the right to purchase 1,000 shares for $10/each then immediately turn around and sell them on the open market for $100/each. That's a $90,000 profit on your $10 investment. 

That's what $TSLA boy did (TBH, I didn't get the reference, so this is just based on guessing). Interestingly, Buffet went the Stockpile route.

If this fucker drops to $12 (like I‚Äôm anticipating on numbers) by the end of the earnings call it‚Äôs going to be above $16 again by the end of AH and probably above that

He's hoping for the best, but this just seems like a short as an insurance policy.
Yeah true. Lot of stocks seem to have those periods were they rise relentlessly for a short period and then go sideways. Berkshire has done this a few times now. From 2012 till 2015 - then sideways for 1,5 years then rising again till 2018. And then sideways from 2018 till last month The stock broke to a new ath recently. TSLA might be another example. Rose from 2013 till 2015 and then sideways for years basically till the summer of 2019

Quick question for anyone with a brain... what‚Äôs the difference between selling my covered call early vs letting it expire. 

When I sell to close the contract does the buyer also have to sell before I collect the premium? 

Also, does ALL of the premium still come my way if they sell before expiration at a loss? Or do I need to wait until it expires in order to collect the full premium?
Good luck
Bade minimum you'll get dizzy.
Guys to make myself feel better, most of the losses you see are the 10k gains from pltr and tsla split into some Ls so i wont really lose much of my initial investments if all options expire worthless i will be losing 2k at most.

Within a browser, Firefox abs chrome for me, you can alter the markup and see it change in real-time. You could change the balance of your RH account. 

However if you have open plays, and it‚Äôs during market hours, any changes you made to the markup will revert back and change as the values are constantly being updated. 

You could bypass this with some simple photoshop but OP showing a video is much harder to fake.

Did this guy get really lucky? Probably. But that apple engineer is so condescending and negative for no fucking reason. Probably just salty because he learned that ‚Äúthe best way to invest is to dump all your money into an index fund!‚Äù. Typical pretentious big ego software engineer who thinks his job at apple means his iq must be above 140!
If mods find it‚Äôs not fake, does that boost Tesla price?
Why not?
Lmao this guy thinks just because you made 30 trades that went well you're some expert and it's not all luck?

Fucking idiot. You can lose it all on one moment. You can flip a coin and land on heads 30 times, that doesn't mean you're going to land heads next time, dumbfuck. 

Also, I'm sure to that guy working at Apple, that's pocket change.

Lol sorry man, I actually sold the position a few days ago, wasn‚Äôt going to post it on WSB but decided to share with my peps.

Eugenics is translated to "Good birth" in China. Maybe you can see why China did CRISPR baby now. Obviously you don't realize it, but Jews in Israel practice eugenics in the form of family planning to avoid diseases like Tay-Sach. 

>When the Aryan race uses the same justification and tells you that it's your genetics that make you inferior and burn the inferior products for the sake of greater good dont cry that it's unfair.

You know there are advocates for eugenics like R. A. Fisher, who pioneered biostatistics and coined terms like _variance_ that believe race mixing is good because it allows each race's best genes to mix together? You let your winners run, and cut out the losers.

And no, if anything, as a tech person in SV, I can tell you SF is a literal shithole, while all the Chinese coastal cities are actually all really nice and new, that is actually making progress.

The COVID-19 vaccine may spell the end of the pandemic, but while mass vaccination is not available it is vital to stop community transmission. The new antiviral drug MK-4482 / EIDD-2801 or Molnupiravir, has managed to suppress "completely" the transmission of the coronavirus in just 24 hours , according to studies by the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of Georgia State University.

5. Proceed to lose it all and start over next week

If you were to use it now for most major EU cities outside of the UK and Ireland you'd see a ton of properties removed from the listings that were up as little as a year or two ago. But I guess it depends on which listings in which countries they're getting most of their revenue from. If its NA, then that shit isn't going to change local govs haven't even begun to enforce fuck all here.

No, I mean it cratered on the news, not sure why people would expect the market to suddenly change its mind ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Also the earnings report was good and stock still dropped. It‚Äôs stupidly overvalued IMO and personally (not that it matters much) but I thought the slack acquisition was dumb for the price. Everyone assumes anything Benioff does must be genius but I always felt he was mostly just a great salesman and a good bullshit artist. The product isn‚Äôt all that amazing. Just my two cents I‚Äôm usually wrong on my fundamentals anyway but when there‚Äôs consensus that the market isn‚Äôt confirming usually the stock goes the other way. I expect it to continue down. Stock has just been very weak and the market clearly did not like the slack buy.

Pfizer is an mRNA vaccine as well. 

mRNA = messenger RNA. Cellular coding system used for the body‚Äôs 3D printers (protein factories) - ribosomes. 

messenger RNA vaccines carry a code to our cells to produce the spike proteins. That‚Äôs it. No active viral component. 

The body will recognize the spike proteins as foreign and form antibodies.

Use the On Demand feature on ToS, his positions and orders check out at the exact strike and price, as well as option volume traded that day. Check the 1/15/21 680C on July 29, 2019. He purchased 2 that day and I'm assuming he bought another 2 in the subsequent 3 months while they were still under $1.15. His original cost basis would have been $1.15, so when the 5 for 1 split happened, each of his 680C would have been split into 5 136C with a cost basis of $0.23!

Based on maintenance margin I've seen for short puts, I don't think you could get to 300% leverage on something volatile like options. They put in limits based on risk, and liquidate automatically when you go under the maintenance margin (there are no margin calls, an algorithm closes whatever positions it likes).

We should have known that a reasonable company like that was having a run better than they deserved. It's not like they're a no-brainer rock solid company that you're stupid for not investing in. 

We should have taken profits and waited for another uptrend to form.

What makes u say that and what strike??
This is easily the single dumbest take I'll read today. OP's helmet must be on a little too tight.

The "logic" this moron on Twitter is shitting out of his fingers is that COVID spike = Syncytin, antibodies to COVID spike = antibodies to Syncytin, COVID vaccine = infertility.

Literally wrong on every single point. COVID spike may share some [vague similarity](https://virological.org/t/response-to-ncov2019-against-backdrop-of-endogenous-retroviruses/396) to Syncytin in the primary structure, maybe. No indication that it does in secondary, tertiary, or quartenary structure. No indication whatsoever that COVID spike antibodies would target human Syncytin. No indication whatsoever that this would cause infertility. No legitimate clinical indication of fertility risk in any vaccine trial thusfar. This take is absolute garbage.

It's absolute garbage. "Here run our dell support assist shit that just says nothing is wrong every single time". Well since you have a warranty I guess we can send some schmuck into your home in the middle of a pandemic to put used parts in to replace your shit.

The closer you get to expiration the faster they'll lose value (theta), so you need a larger gain in the underlying to make up that loss.

If you hold on for too long, even if it goes to 30-35 you'll lose money, so buy calls further out unless you think it will skyrocket by January.

PSTH will hover around 20-25 until Bill announces something. Rumors are that we'll know before end of year, maybe next week if we're lucky. So if that doesn't happen, your calls are likely fucked

They have been lowering nicotine yield, not content. Lowering the 'measured' yield is not nearly as effective as lowering the nicotine content of the tobacco.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC493271/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC493271/)

The nicotine yield of cigarettes measured by machine-smoking does not reliably predict the exposure of smokers. Smokers consuming low-yield nicotine cigarettes did not reduce actual intake of nicotine to the level that might be expected, especially for those heavily dependent on nicotine.

We have shown here that smokers of low nicotine cigarettes did not reduce their actual intake of nicotine to the degree that would be expected from the nicotine yield on the packages. Although smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.1 mg nicotine would be expected to ingest one-eleventh of the nicotine ingested by smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.9‚Äì2.4 mg nicotine (average of 1.1 mg), the average urinary cotinine concentration of the former group was more than half that of the latter (535 ng/mg Cr vs. 1010 ng/mg Cr).

&#x200B;

They've been raising the prices for ages now and that seems to help somewhat, but reducing the nicotine content to non-addictive levels would ensure the addiction is never created for new smokers.

I think the main issue with your post is that you leave out the fact that the people posting serious DD on this are being pretty upfront about the risks and the fact that it‚Äôs still a speculative play. I would say YOLO is the only serious poster who‚Äôs really gone into YOLO land.

The DD above, as you point out, is good but at the end of the day it‚Äôs all speculation. I appreciate the fact they have at least brought things together in a tidy way for the rest of us to see and make decisions on.

That‚Äôs said, and as DD mentions, whether it‚Äôs Stripe or not it‚Äôs gunna moon.

There‚Äôs just a lot of circumstantial evidence in favor of stripe. Also your WB stuff is particularly misleading and erroneous.

It's a monthly minimum fee. If your commissions are >$10 in a month you don't pay any extra.

1% interest on $10k is $100, so you'd save that if borrowing that amount for a year with Pro vs Lite.

I think you have to pay market data fees with Pro, they can be $4.50/month, level 2 data is more.
yuppp nice little balance on the edge of fire
Or perhaps they are simply taking some profits since we've quadrupled since earlier this year? Lol
There‚Äôs still a month left for 2020 to surprise us.
You need to understand that the day you buy the option, you are paying a price that is factoring in the current rate of growth in value expected for the stock.  For example, if you paid 800 premium for a stock that hits X by Y date, and it exactly does hit X by Y date, you will be out your 800 dollars as your option has no value when you exercise it.  If X hits Y+ the amount needed in order to save you 800 dollars, all you did was break even (except you were out your 800 dollars for that whole time and unable to invest it :P)  


An "accurately priced" option is one that exactly hits the needed break even price by the expiration date, but in the real world situations change due to new events being brought to light.  Say a massive increase in value due to one of X's largest competitors going out of business.  This was unpredictable at the time the option was written and/or bought, and so not priced in to the premium, hence the gambling nature of options.  

&#x200B;

You are "betting" that the market and everyone buying/selling the stock is wrong about the valuation.  Whether this be because you actually have knowledge or informed opinion, or your just a degenerate gambler with an addiction, is the reason you would take on the option.

The rise in GME share price this year is mostly a correction from its undervalued levels. Up 165% isn't shit when you consider it's still down over 50% on the 5 year. Also consider they did massive stock buybacks of 38% of existing shares at this point last year. 

So up 165% on the year isn't that impressive when you have 38% stock buybacks at the start of that period, then you got Ryan Cohen buying 10% as well as a few other major investors and other major catalysts boosting the price.

May I ask what your psychology was during the day(I‚Äôm assuming it was the day where you had a 200% run up before deflating)? I ask because I used to be in the same position when I didn‚Äôt have enough to for pdt and would refuse to sell positions after good profits. My cut off where I was willing to call it a day trade was +100% in one day. Between that and keeping 2 active portfolios(schwab and robinhood) I found that it‚Äôs easier to bypass pdt with smaller amounts of money, but you‚Äôre limited to bargain purchases until you hit a couple bangers.

I would roll the PSTH calls if we don't get news in a week
That's exactly it, except that it's more of an hourly list of executions. I think the moderation of a community like this is a lot like IT work in that if it's done right you don't really notice all that much.

I figured people might enjoy seeing how many tards we get rid of so they'd understand the couple that get through in better context.

I did not misread it, and my interpretation of it is pretty much spot on. I can't tell if you are trolling at this point or just truly oblivious to the fact of how an uninformed person can interpret your comment as Trump is the one to blame for no stimulus. I'm gonna stop here for my own sanity, you libtards truly are as dense as they come. To be so aware of a situation yet simultaneously deny truths when they are inconvenient.

Thanks for reminding me why I hate politics.

You're obviously not a home owner, it's not that easy to sell and buy a new house.  I spent almost a year renovating and buying furniture and now I should just move out?

I did some reading. Evidently, 'light' smokes are measured using YIELD vs content. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC493271/

The nicotine yield of cigarettes measured by machine-smoking does not reliably predict the exposure of smokers. Smokers consuming low-yield nicotine cigarettes did not reduce actual intake of nicotine to the level that might be expected, especially for those heavily dependent on nicotine.

We have shown here that smokers of low nicotine cigarettes did not reduce their actual intake of nicotine to the degree that would be expected from the nicotine yield on the packages. Although smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.1 mg nicotine would be expected to ingest one-eleventh of the nicotine ingested by smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.9‚Äì2.4 mg nicotine (average of 1.1 mg), the average urinary cotinine concentration of the former group was more than half that of the latter (535 ng/mg Cr vs. 1010 ng/mg Cr).

XXII is the only company actually producing tobacco with nicotine content at such a low rate. And they have dozens of studies to show that the lowered nicotine in the cigarette leads to lower nicotine consumption & absorption, vs with the light cigarettes we do not see the same sort of effects.
Because no one can accurately time the GME rocket's take off. We know it's going to, we just don't know when. In other words, buy shares.
nobody gives a fuck about the school you go to. go do your Bachelor's at a community college, then switch to a decent state school.

Interesting. I'm not sure what the best play is, but a bet on volatility increasing over this next couple months sounds like a pretty good one. I also like the play of just loading up on clean energy and buying the dip if there is one. Blue Wave or not, 4 years from now (even 1 year from now) I'm confident clean energy will be higher.
Rudy got the corona. Bullish?
So i havent reached Autism then, still got some time to get there?

Is the trade take both sides of the Jan weeklies (puts and calls) and hope that the gain in one pay's for the losses in the other?

So a few of the ‚Äúdangers‚Äù of LEAPS that I‚Äôve experienced which can be easily avoided if you just do your DD and know what the greeks actually mean are as follows
-Liquidity. 
Far OTM/EXP LEAPS for anything that‚Äôs not a major blue chip and or index have very low volume so you need to make sure that you get somewhat of an acceptable fill and can plan your exit accordingly.

-IV.
A lot of people forget that the further out exp just inherently have higher IV by percentage and can be subject to severe IV crush if market volatility is high.

So to give you an example of a leap strategy back in September I picked up some 1/15/21 SPY 370C for 2.30 at the time it had a delta of .23 and a theta of -.003. So that means for 230$ premium I paid. i have a position that would move 23$ up or down with SPY in correlation to the stock price so with a higher overall exposure with inherently less risk in capital because in order to mimic that same return with shares i would‚Äôve had to pick up well over 32K of SPY.
Doing a lot of saying, but it's really just a bunch of wind trying to cover up the fact that you misread my initial comment.

Keep going, I'm still amused. For now.

I know you're hugely bearish on GME but no HF can hold their position in GME with an average cost under $15 and a quickly rising share price. There are risk management measures.

It's not like a long position where you can just hold through losses. Mark-to-market losses and margin will make it impossible for them to hold a position that is hundreds of percent underwater.

You are just being dense. You know full well that when you typed out that comment you were doing so with the intention of ORANGE MAN BAD nothing more. Now you want to pull out the technicalities of your original statement and try and nit pick at the fine details. 

 "Chump gonna veto it if it passes and tell Fox News that the libtards ruined it" 

Also after re-reading your original comment it is quite ironic how from late July till the present the "libtards" are actually the one cucking a stop-gap stimulus package. Of course, you know this but for some reason won't acknowledge it.

100% believe beating the market is not only possible, but doable on the regular. The problem is that extracting that market beating premium takes hard work. You have to put effort and intelligence into making money consistently just like any other job.

I'd rather be good at my job and make the beaucoup bucks there than learn everything I need to know to beat the market consistently, so invest most of my wealth in index funds. Still do buy FDs occasionally when I think I have a real edge.

this stock is so frustrating.  I can't really figure out what they do, but by looking at the chart, it appears so underwhelming.  In these days of easy money, and a large dividend, this company might as well be a local mom and pop.  They have 10 billion market cap, and there are way smaller companies out there that are less sophisticated, but have way more market cap.  Like TWLO for instance.

He paid $1.13 per contract.  And that's believable because I bought 1/15/21 $420 calls for $12 per contract.  This was when TSLA was around $240.  $680 calls when TSLA was $200 would've been in the buck or less range.

You have to remember TSLA was rangebound for like 5 years.  People thought TSLA would go bankrupt and very few thought TSLA would even break $400.  It's previous all-time high was like $383 or so.  $680 seemed crazy when TSLA was at $200 with all the bankruptcy talk.

Don‚Äôt compare me to poors who still use toilet paper and regular blankets.
Besides stimulus and re-opening, a major near-term catalyst I'm not hearing enough about is the Georgia run-off election January 5th and the two possible outcomes.

1) Republican's preserve at least one of the two seats: This is the more likely scenario. This will result in a short term blow to Biden favorable stocks. The last hope for a Blue Wave will be snuffed out. The chances of marijuana being federally legalized diminish, and prospects for clean energy lose their luster on the short term. At the same time this will be a bullish long term catalyst for the overall market given that the Biden administration will not be able to hamstring corporate America with as many policies, and the status quo would be mostly preserved, which decreases uncertainty and thus encourages investor confidence. This could also be a short term bearish catalyst because it makes it unlikely that we get as large of a stimulus bill.

2) Democrats steal both seats: This would be a shocking and less likely scenario, but far from the realm of impossibly. This would result in the fabled Blue Wave. With Democrats in full controll of the executive and legislative branches, it will be four years of pumping out Democrat policies with little holding them back. This would be extremely bullish for specific sectors, weed and clean energy being the most obvious ones. It could also be bullish on the short term due to the possibility of a large stimulus package. However it would be a bearish event for the next four years and we could enter into a long bear market as corporate America and Wallstreet seek to protect their wealth from a Biden administration.

Pay close attention to how it plays out, and place your bets accordingly!

You have balls man. I wouldn't have thought of putting 5k worth into INTC contracts.
True, that works, until it doesn't and you have to B-T-C as the LEAP would be worth too much. I wouldn't devote more than 50% of an active portfolio to LEAPS. Buying shares (at that point), you can get more margin, divs (lol) and sell true covered calls at a strike you'd gladly sell your shares at.
My friend in India didn‚Äôt even get back his covid result and its been like a month.
Dude didn‚Äôt lie, the calls were trading for $1.15 last July when Tesla crashed to $200.

Do the math. He bought 6 of them for $1.15 each and post split had 30 contracts (5 for 1 split is 6x5 = 30 for the tards who missed the news). He sold off 10 of them and holds 20.

At the time he was guessing Tesla would more than triple from $200 to $680 by January and he got lucky.

TLDR- Does  a "pass" on a college transcript look like a mental midget of a  student? 

So a fairly "well respected prof." has  been saying it would be a good idea take a "pass or fail" if a grade is going to hurt your GPA. Meaning if you have a 3.82 GPA even if you got an A- in a class take a "pass" (just in that specefic class) and just tell interviewer's "it was pass or fail becuase of COVID" and "it will be no big deal" according to the prof....IDK seems kinda sketchy and looks like you can't take a "loss" and realize growing pains to an interviewer (less to talk about really actually learning imo too) but my prof. has a point. What do ya'll think? Take pass or fail or just suck it up and take the B or B+. I have a 3.8

Look at your current favorite stocks and look at the value of Leaps in the past year. Chances are they are worth less now than they were a couple of months ago. To break even on a $50 dollar LEAP you might need a price of $60. If your break even is double the stock price, why not just buy shares and double your money?

LFMAO. Why don't you read the Plomin review? Even just the subheading would be great. Plomin is arguably the top authority on Behavioral Genetics. IQ is one of the few behavioral trait where the heritability actually increases with age.

>Socioeconomic position (SEP) is a multi-dimensional construct reflecting (and influencing) multiple socio-cultural, physical, and environmental factors. In a sample of 286,301 participants from UK Biobank, we identify 30 (29 previously unreported) independent-loci associated with income. Using a method to meta-analyze data from genetically-correlated traits, we identify an additional 120 income-associated loci. These loci show clear evidence of functionality, with transcriptional differences identified across multiple cortical tissues, and links to GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. By combining our genome wide association study on income with data from eQTL studies and chromatin interactions, 24 genes are prioritized for follow up, 18 of which were previously associated with intelligence. We identify intelligence as one of the likely causal, partly-heritable phenotypes that might bridge the gap between molecular genetic inheritance and phenotypic consequence in terms of income differences. These results indicate that, in modern era Great Britain, genetic effects contribute towards some of the observed socioeconomic inequalities.

Feel free to believe whatever you want, but I truly because the west is on the decline compared to China because of people like you who categorically reject a fact because it's fucking thoughtcrime. And let me tell you Chinese people doesn't have that white guilt complex like you do, and Xi Jingping is someone who have the emotional maturity to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.

>The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns states that wherever it has been studied, children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers. The correlation between IQ scores and grades is about .50.

>According to Schmidt and Hunter, "for hiring employees without previous experience in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability."

 >The American Psychological Association's 1996 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was ‚àí0.2. It was ‚àí0.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to ‚àí0.17. A correlation of 0.20 means that the explained variance is 4%. The causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect. Children with poor scholastic performance may feel alienated. Consequently, they may be more likely to engage in delinquent behavior, compared to other children who do well

>Multiple studies conducted in Scotland have found that higher IQs in early life are associated with lower mortality and morbidity rates later in life.

Would you go to a top 3 school or top 10 school if it meant saving 15k by going to worse school. Thoughts?
that's a lot of octopi
No kidding. But if you want cheap, you should buy some shares of AMZN. They'll go up to like 150 by the end of the year and that's about where they'll be.

If something has greater than 100% sold short, it means the people borrowing shares then lend those shares out again. It's rare but it's possible.

CCL has no business being above 15 right now but you can probably hold it until 25 or so just on a purely technical basis.

I do expect that it will go below $15 again but saying when is the tricky part.
Just want to make sure our new botherens are on the same page as all of us here, you can short your contracts and make money all while still hold your bullish position.

Eventually, this company may pose an actual systemic market risk. 

The amount of shares that institutional buyers are accumulating to write these insane call options is extraordinary. At some point, owning 5,000,000 shares of a company trading at 100x trailing revenue is going to catch the attention of a risk desk and there is going to be an unwinding with retailers holding extremely heavy bags. 

For instance, AT&T peaked at $57/share in 1999. It has literally never recovered that price in the intervening 20+ years. At that time, the world was convinced that they would take over the planet and there would be nothing to stop them.

Use a real trading platform.

In fidelity active trader you open the chart for the specific option and then just change the date range. I have another reply in this thread showing it
This is called the option *style*.  American-style options may be exercised any time up to and including their expiration date.  European-style options may only be exercised at their expiration date.

American-style options are available on exchanges based in Europe; the terminology is potentially misleading.   There are many other option styles used in the OTC market, but these are the two you'll encounter with vanilla listed options.

Not the govt but maybe the exchanges. My worst fear is them adding collateral requirement needed for exercising the options you buy. Boom game over.
You also realize that short sellers are paying to borrow right? It's not like holding shares where you can hold forever and it costs you nothing. 

As less shares are available it gets harder to short and cost to hold the short increases. Eventually it gets to a point where it's more expensive to hold the short than it is to take the loss.
No but selling the one behind it is, say we open red tomorrow I just buy back the shorted contract for a cheaper price and collect the premium, technically I still hold my call and got paid for its decline.
That shit is fake af. The all time chart he posted was clearly photoshopped (if you increased brightness and zoomed in you could see there were text boxes and other edits). If the all time chart is faked, I have a hard time believing the positions image wasn‚Äôt too

This is an exact replica of 2000. You are married to this position, and you will ride the sled down the mountain when it finally cracks.

The idea that Tesla is going to command a full 20% of the entire worldwide automobile market is absolutely ludicrous. I am not sure how sub-Saharan Africans will be affording to purchase these automobiles, not to mention the fact that China is absolutely not going to allow Tesla to gain a foothold there. 

Further, there is massive competition for self-driving automobiles. You think that Google is somehow behind on that front? They started their Waymo project in 2009, whereas Tesla only began their autopilot program in 2013 or 2014.

Tesla exists to do one thing: increase its share price.

My only issue with 10% compounding is having to wait til my body is old and decrepit to be able to enjoy the fruits of my labor.
You have the option TO BUY 100 shares each at the specified strike price. So $72 * 100 shares = $7200. $7200 to buy 100 shares IF YOU exercise the option. 

You only exercise if you want to own the shares and have the capital to purchase the option at its premium + 100 shares. Most people sell the options instead of exercising.

What‚Äôs the best chance of big returns to buy LEAPS in tomorrow?
Yeah that's exactly what you wont get with AAPL calls. Lol.
Ok thank for the info bro. So here is what I would:

If you are ok with less risk; Sell the $25 12/24 if it gets there (give or take .50c) by this Wednesday. That should allow you to sell and get approx 30% of total value. Let the others ride until the following Tuesday and then bail for the pennies left.

Your first comment is misdirecting blame and villainizing Trump by implying he is the one who is cucking stimulus. Had someone not been informed about the developments surrounding stimulus, they would likely come to the conclusion that Trump is the problem. That is what I dislike. Stop being dense and admit that was the original intention behind your post. The way you say "Chump" says it all.......
You only posted a picture with words on it that I can see. No title, no follow up, no citations.... why don‚Äôt you post some of that and we can talk about it.
If you see someone degrading someone based on race it is okay to call out their racism. You don‚Äôt need to know the skin color of someone to call them racist. White people are not the only people that are racist. There are racist people of every skin color. African Americans, Asians, native Americans, Hispanics, Europeans and everyone else can be considered racist, and their beliefs are what makes them racist, not their skin color.

$20 on the upside and $14 on the downside
I'm pretty sure it did.  TSLA hit $373 or so back in Dec 2018.  So lot of higher leap option prices got released then.  TSLA tanked over 50% and hit low of $179 on June 3, 2019, I think and I'm pretty sure leap options were dirt cheap because all the FUD about TSLA going bankrupt.  The negatively and FUD was insane back then and everyone hated TSLA.

More leverage is GOOD if you have "so much faith in a company". That's exactly when you should use the power of options for more leverage. You're not making much sense. Go educate yourself bc it's painfully clear you have no idea what you're talking about. If not and you're simply opposed to options, WTF are you even doing on this subreddit? The whole point is to make high risk high reward plays and share in the pain or glory.

Great douchebag post. Let me guess you went into PLTR this past week.
I know you‚Äôre stupid and highly impressionable, so I don‚Äôt anticipate you‚Äôll get much (or anything at all) from this, but maybe someone who isn‚Äôt you will, as you are regurgitating false information that is easily and quickly debunked with even a small amount of effort.   

You can find the study that the false claim you are repeating refers to right here:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599911/pdf/nihms76103.pdf   

If you go beyond your original research (of reading and believing your pedo uncle‚Äôs Facebook posts) you will find that this study makes no mention of masks let alone reusing masks. The study posits that many, if not most, of the deaths in the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic were likely caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia infections resulting from the primary infection of Influenza A, and not the Spanish Flu/Influenza A, itself.   

It‚Äôs a bit like determining that jumping off the roof of a building doesn‚Äôt cause a jumper‚Äôs death, secondary contact with the ground causes their death.   

We all have bacteria in our lungs. We all walk on the ground every day. Respiratory illnesses can cause that bacteria to flourish and become bacterial pneumonia. Falling from the height of a roof can make contacting the ground a much more painful experience than going for a walk.

Honestly. 

The development wasn‚Äôt THAT accelerated. It really wasn‚Äôt.  

mRNA vaccines have been the ‚Äúnext thing‚Äù for vaccine for several years. The reason for the excitement about them is that they will be much faster and more flexible a vehicle to deliver the vaccine. 

So, the groundwork was done.  All they had to do next was figure out a target for the ‚Äúpayload‚Äù.   

That portion was sped up considerably by having a concerted effort in the medical/pharmaceutical community INTERNATIONALLY. 

Basically China gave us the viral genome from day 1. That saved months. 

This  was a worldwide effort. 

Second, production started BEFORE the vaccine was finished and authorized. That was a HUGE gamble. Yes, it would have to be scrapped if the vaccine didn‚Äôt work. But the US Govt gambled that it would be good. And it worked. 

Lastly. mRNA vaccines use the human body to produce the antigen (target for the immunity). This is MUCH faster. Otherwise, viruses have to be grown in chicken embryos deactivated/processed...etc. That actually takes YEARS to do. 

That is why mRNA vaccines are revolutionary. We can bypass that whole growing step.

False: "Do you think that I hold you in some regard where there is value to me in proving anything to you? I think you have a Napolean complex and that you sound arrogant. It's fun that you keep going, but it has gotten a little boring now."
Did you even look at historical price action and then adjust to current day variables? Its right on the chart OP posted. This time is not going to be any different except that the longs will benefit more.

$100/share is 6.5bn market cap. That is what GME revenues in 1 year. 1.5bn will be coming from e-commerce sales that usually receive a 2x multiple from the market. That is $32/share on its own and only represents <20% of total sales. It's not like $100/share is even a wild valuation.. Focus on market cap not share price. I swear you guys think all stocks start at $1 and are somehow priced accordingly to that.

GME will be getting to that price with help of the shorts exiting when it hits max pain soon enough.

How does it compare to teams? Teams is the go-to and I don't really see that changing just because CRM integrated it. Teams is also practically free bundled with their other softwares.

You‚Äôre the only individual person I‚Äôve actually ever claimed to be racist. If you‚Äôre asian from Asia you will understand that there is a ton of racism tied to asian cultures.

It‚Äôs been dead around here lately every since people got wiped out in PLTR
You buy 100 shares of say, AAL, then sell a call for a 5% higher strike price 2 weeks out. You can't do anything with your 100 shares since that's collateral, but you pocket the money from the sale of the stock option. The worst case is the stock falls hard enough to where the current price +5% is less than your initial investment, since at that point you will lose money if you sell a call and the call is executed, so you either have to bag hold until the stock price goes back up or sell a call and possibly take a loss.

&#x200B;

Otherwise the stock basically stays the same and you just pocket the money from the sale of the Call, or the call is executed and you're forced to sell your shares at the strike price (still profit) and you still have the money from selling the contract. Then you have to re-buy your 100 shares at whatever price it's at now if you want to go back in
Eh, only if someone is naive and inexperienced. 

I had precisely one girl like that, and cut bait because she was looking for commitment after she had just gained like 40 pounds, and I was 27 and just starting to make really good money and had absolutely no interest in settling down. Lo and behold, like 12 months later I saw I saw on social media that she had found some dude and they were getting married. 

I can't fucking imagine being married to that chick right now, I'd probably be completely numb to the world. Honestly, the fact that I was single through this COVID bullshit is one of the most fortunate things that has ever happened to me.

This is just one of the many price that we will have to pay for stopping COVID. Don‚Äôt take me in wrong way but, the main goal right now is to control its spread. It‚Äôs not out in public discussions, but am ardently sure that governments around the world don‚Äôt care about any effects that this vaccines will have in future. No wonder the development of a vaccine to novel virus took just 7-8 months with expedited approval processes. Stopping is all is cared for right now, not saying vaccines won‚Äôt work, they will and are already having bigger success rates for us to roll out in public.

Another price we are going to pay is human behavior change and seeking more isolation in this already isolated time/world. We have changed on a mental level after this virus.

Jesus, OP is asking about LEAPs and safety and you don‚Äôt want to factor in growth of the underlying in an instrument designed to replicate the underlying with a leverage factor. Yea, you can risky up your choice of strike and underlying to leverage your tits off, but the reason it‚Äôs risky is because you could have a continuously depreciating asset with dwindling marketability and decreasing IV making you lose larger sums of money than near term options. This market currently is fucking insane but we absolutely could return to the 02-06 market.

GME is not worth $100 a share so why would a short try to cover at such a ridiculous price instead of just paying the margin call and wait for the inevitable correction back to realistic numbers?

Say it hits $100 and all you guys try to sell your shares who is going to buy them? This will lead to paper hands retail slowly lowering the price down trying to get out of their long before it drops back to a fair number. All the shorts have to do is wait for that. If no one will buy at 100 then people will sell for say 95 then no one buys and they drop to 90 and so on and so on. 

Your entire plan is based on the shorts panicking and buying at numbers that we all know are un realistic in relation to what GME is actually worth.

Politics aside, based on your previous comment you're making it seem as though Trump is the wrench in the deal when in reality he isnt. Id say most of the blame goes to Nancy (who is actually ruining the finances of Americans by delaying a stimulus that could have been approved 3 months ago for the sole purpose of making Trump lose the election). McConnell is also delaying things but was ALWAYS willing to accept a 500 billion interim deal which of course Nancy refuses to accept.

well guess mods took down my post then cause I didn‚Äôt delete it. This is what I said in my post‚Äù this most recent study is basically one step down from finding a cure to cancer.‚Äù The mouse cancer study came out two weeks ago or something and the sickle cell study came out yesterday. So which one is the most recent study. I forgot you retards don‚Äôt read though so honestly my bad for not specifying the sickle cell study
It's because those relief bills are all attempting to bail out NYC and Chicago instead of forcing them to declare bankruptcy. Mitch is 100% right to tell them to eat a dick.

Index funds are for people who can't beat the market so they come up with stupid modern portfolio theories and all sorts of self gratifying academic bullshit to justify and praise their mediocrity. These people are the finance world equivalent of parents who want every kid on both teams to get a fucking trophy. Even Buffet thinks its a stupid idea. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJzu\_xItNkY&t=97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJzu_xItNkY&t=97) 

That said, ETFs are great if you don't know what you are doing and want to be safe, and for that reason Warren also like ETFs because it makes average gains accessible to stupid people like you and me.

I buy a lot of ETFs because I am stupid. But I have learned to pad these gains with options and companies I feel strongly about from time to time.

the replies made me laugh, and even though I got eaten alive for posting, I learned my lesson lol I have a lot to learn about stocks
Yes
To be fair I think those statistics are misleading. 

Options are designed to lose, that‚Äôs the whole idea, and mostly what they‚Äôre used for by the big financial institutions. It‚Äôs like homeowners insurance. I don‚Äôt pay my insurance and then cross my fingers that my house burns down. I pay my insurance, basically with the intention of throwing that money away and taking a loss.

I‚Äôm not sure how the numbers are being put together that I always see people trot out about ‚Äú95% of options traders lose money‚Äù, but if they‚Äôre including all of the people who buy options as insurance with the intention of throwing that money away, the way you do with any insurance, then the stats they‚Äôre presenting about options traders losing money is wildly misleading.

You also have to consider that with every person who trades a spread, even if they win on the option they bought, they simultaneously have a loss on the contract they sold. If you‚Äôre just looking at trades and not considering dollar amounts, you could say that trader had a winning trade and a losing trade, so in they end they were neutral, when in fact they came out ahead.

Again, I don‚Äôt know how they put those numbers together, but there‚Äôs a lot of ways you could make that data tell a disingenuous story.

not saying it'll hit 300. that I think it is too much? but going from 50 to 80-100 range the day of its ipo is very likely, and I would be hesitant to buy shares when it hits 100 this early. I will wait for a pull back. The hype has been unreal.

During a volatile market, like the one we are in, LEAPS are the best way to go imo. 

If you have a reason to believe a stock will be much higher months, or even a year from now, LEAPS will pay you handsomely compared to buying stock.

That said, they are a lot riskier.

Here‚Äôs the real question: did they buy the right calls?        

Food for thought: institutional investors make up the largest share of options traders. Institutional traders tend to trade options as hedges against their own portfolio positions. That is why you tend to see markets trend the other way of call:put ratios.

The only potential in this stock both short term and in current outlook is driven by hype.

You‚Äôre contradicting yourself and taking articles describing relative demand as valuable. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not think about COVID, think forward.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut Google Airbnb COVID demand‚Äù.

Not that I made any specific point about this, but rural properties are less plentiful and much cheaper. So demand for ‚ÄúRural Rentals‚Äù and ‚ÄúGetaways‚Äù will not balance out loss in Urban demand, and this will evaporate as the need to get away from urban density due to virus eases up. Case in point: their financial losses in 2020.

Looking forward further:

1. They‚Äôve completely scrapped or put on pause most of their diversifying aspirations, and went directly into survival mode within the first quarter of the pandemic. Travel services, experiences, property management, real estate ownership.

2. As a consequence, they are, for now and the foreseeable future, operating to compete as and against hotels and nothing else. The last thing you want for an attractive tech IPO is for them to settle as a regular competitor in a long-standing and existing market

3. Regarding hotel competition: Prior to COVID, large potential line of business for Airbnb was growing acceptance in business travel. Which will have a large chunk permanently erased with permanent tele-commuting capabilities.

Gotta run, but you see the point. I haven‚Äôt done the data analysis, and again anecdotal and word of mouth, but I have friends who are longstanding engineers, data science, Strat planning at Airbnb, and the ones left are the ones reflecting the above sentiment. Might also not have been you, but someone mentioned that the regulatory concerns are relaxing ‚Äî and that‚Äôs straight up not true.

Not to say the IPO can‚Äôt go well. Look at fucking NKLA and Hertz and all these other meme stocks.

No you referenced ‚Äúcancer‚Äù explicitly in your now conveniently removed post
I dont know all those fancy words but I buy them all the time.

Example:

AAPL - current price - 122.12

7/16/2021 50c - premium 72.50

Intrinsic Value: 

Difference between $50 strike and $122.12 stock price is $72.12,

So you can buy this option and purchase the 100 shares for $5000.00 then instantly sell them for $12212.00.

Extrinsic Value:

Premium - Intrensic Value

$72.50 - $72.12 = $38 in premium (0.5% of premium over 6 months) less than 0.1% per month. 

Additionally the delta is 0.9899, you make every dollar the stock goes up and you can get 3 of them for control of 300 shares for the price of 200 shares.

Of course it's possible to beat the market for some period of time.  People do it all the time. Most people can't tho because they don't understand how, nor do they care to learn. And that's fine. They should do index funds. 

If you lived 10,000 years it's doubtful you could beat the index for that entire time. But we don't live 10,000 years, we live maybe 100 and we invest for maybe 30 of that?  You only got to beat it for a few decades and then retire. People do that all the time.  Some get lucky, some get unlucky. And skill and knowledge makes a difference but not ALL the difference.

Think of it like poker, you can't win every single hand and luck plays a role, but guys make a living playing poker because they have something everyone else doesn't.

Word but even then profit share is going to IMAX disproportionately for the theater. Wouldn't be surprised to watch them start their own theaters at some point.
If PFE doesn't explode on news of an approved vaccine then I know nothing of this world
I still don't understand why this was a comedy. There were like 5 jokes about how shitty of a scenario it was for Matt Damon.
No, an inherently failing business model is, for example, one that is not profitable. There‚Äôs room for both streaming services and movie theaters. They‚Äôve coexisted for over a decade. I agree that the buyout poses risk to anti trust, i don‚Äôt know how to solve that one
Anybody got a mirror?   Was sitting around thinking in all my years I‚Äôve never had a real good look at my leather cheerio.  Need to put that to rest right quick.

Still waiting on that belle delphin shit though
Still not clear what happens after the vaccine. If COVID isn't gone by summer, all of you guys might be broke in 2021
That means Amazon could at least buy Quebec and finally turn it into the sovereign nation it dreams of being

this airbnb motherfucker is going to hit $100 before options even come out at which point, it'll be already too late. fuck this ipo shit.
That means buy calls. More people at home chilling all they got time to do is trade on RH cause they can't do anything else.
rightttt only 50% of restaurants have closed permanently

Yes but worried about a drop after vaccine approval end of week
ngl if OnlyFans did IPO it would probably not be a great buy because zero moat and if they really do grow enough to warrant serious tendies then other companies are going to get in on it and grind their margins down

Maybe but unlikely. We are going to meet a lot of resistance at $280

I bought April exp last week Wednesday. Not exactly leaps but that stock has more than blown it's top off. Wouldn't be surprised to see it at 120 very soon and possibly much lower. With that said.... No way it should be where it is now so it could keep going up fast.

Gosh, you are stupid. Did you know it was Nancy Pelosi who REFUSED to negotiate a 1 trillion stimulus plan that was McConnell's opening bid? They likely could have worked out a deal in the 1.2-1.5 trillion dollar range had Nancy been willing to come down from her RIDICULOUS 3 trillion-dollar proposal. 

Furthermore, leading up to the election Nancy also refused McConnell's 1.9 trillion dollar offer, even when her party members advised her to take it. She is the one holding up stimulus along with McConnell, Not Trump.

You could, but that shouldn‚Äôt be the expectations. Depends on your risk tolerance and timing. It should be expectations of nominal stock growth with an added compensation for risk. Normal growth would be 10-20% and add a 30% risk factor on top.

Netflix started streaming content in 2007. Here we are in 2020 and people are still choosing novel movies in theaters over the same old convenient Netflix content.  

Absolutely theaters are comparable to movie-themed amusement parks with regard to brand building as well as how much revenue they generate. 

The theater is where the Disney experience begins. Little kids learn about the Disney multi-verse and it‚Äôs characters on the big screen, and later beg their parents to take them to Disney Land where they can freely interact with these characters. 

In Q4 2019 (pre pandemic), Disney made $6.7B from its parks and resorts, and $3.3B from its studio.

Robinhood is legitimately easy to use and has a great looking mobile app. Clean and simple.


Robinhood is also the most retarded company in existence. It's shocking they're allowed to handle their own money, let alone anyone else's. They fucked up and forgot to account for leap year in their software code. Trading around daylight savings time is always a risk for the same reason. And they routinely go down just when you need to execute a trade. People on here have some serious horror stories.

RH is pain. I have ToS up on my monitors and sit there using RH on my phone. Limit sell triggers on RH work 30% of the time, even if the call has a 20 cent bid/ask spread and u set the stop .20 below ask (at bid). Lost almost 1k of extra gains on friday alone because of that. 

Besides having to fight citadel algos on every low interest/volume call, they have endless bullshit. Nickel and dime increments cuck you from doing cheap otm yolos. You can't even buy FDs on Friday's. 

That said, I'd never want to make some of the plays I've done on my TDA, RH provides you visual xanax so you can calmly do the trade that shouldn't work but makes so you a lot. ToS mobile is an awful app, I'll give you that. Almost as bad as RH website.

Not true at all, and the reason it‚Äôs not true is the same reason bogle made index funds.

 Median stock returns ~2% a year. Index funds average ~9% a year because 4% of their stocks account for 91% of the gains offsetting the fact that the other 96% didn‚Äôt perform well. (This maps pretty closely to studies indicating ~95% of stock pickers underperform the market). Also, 40% of stocks return negative a year.

If you already have an Ameritrade account then identify 3 or 4 diverse, dividend preferred stock positions,  (energy, tech, retail, finance) that you absolutely want to hold long term and not really look at it.  Put majority of your money (70%+) into those holdings via Ameritrade and withdraw the rest of your money for RH or WeBull for active trading.    Robinhood gets a bad rap because of the sheer volume of inexperienced traders that use it but it honestly makes daytrading very fun, the UI is clean and free of clutter so it makes tracking and selling options much more efficient and enjoyable and doesn't have nearly as many order/transaction fees as Ameritrade

Alright I fucked up last week and lost almost everything. Down to my last $600. What‚Äôs a solid play? I threw it into long AAPL calls.
Probably not. Orwell wrote people to be the perfect form of whatever trope he was ham-fistedly trying to convey. They dont act like recognizable persons, and as a result his models of dystopia are ultimately unrecognisable in most respects. He did have a deep understanding of basic social structures. His creations are like someone who new what a lego build was supposed to look like but only used square bricks. Huxley understood the nature of the human animal, and Brave New World is a masterwork in reflecting an absurd result of that nature. Neither was predictive.
There‚Äôs a median to building wealth imo, like I only have 1 stock that‚Äôs a growth stock that has no competition risk, no fda risk, no regulation risk, good growth, good ceo, good financials, high upside, and positioned perfectly for the future. Aka Tesla or Apple. So knowing this it‚Äôs not really a risk to me so I can pick one of those to put my entire life savings, DCA, 401k, etc into. So when Tesla does 700% like this past year (during a market crash) I will increase my entire net worth by 7x plus by only next year, now think the next 5 years.... it‚Äôs the power of capital efficiency and Dollar Cost Averaging on the right company in order to build true wealth. Diversification is for keeping your wealth once you have it. Capital efficiency is for building wealth.

Knowledge is power.

Ok and how much are you working with right now
Hahahaaha
Lol nobody is getting the check.
Think of it this way.

You are paying a large premium to give the stock more time to "jump". If you buy a far OTM leap youre hoping that at some point the stock gets a crazy bull run.

If all the stock does is slowly climb up over time, you may lose money from theta burn and iv drop.

Also you need to be careful of the bid/ask differences. Unless youre getting options on an ETF you could end up buying an option well above the mark.

You could try to use that to youre advantage by the way....try to buy an option for below the mark, and then just sell it for a higher price.
Hahahahah

Hmm the thoughts of someone self centered in racism? Lawsuits related to wrongful death happen no matter how rich or poor someone is in most cases(within developed countries). The fact that the more money someone has the more money their family receives in a wrongful death lawsuit should not be surprising, nor should it be surprising that the cost of court expenses would increase dramatically as the wealth of the victim increases. The relation between wealth gap and increased court costs is something you will see in every country, including developing nations.
Thanks!

INVERSE THE NEWS 

good news? Stocks go down?

Corona mutates into a zombie virus and dead people start reanimating? Money printer go brrrrrr tendies for all bulls
Lots. They are actually in a better position then they were before the beer flu hit. Pre rona share price was around $46, current price is $41. They were already heavily discounted before the rona though mind you. So $46 isn't a resistance level, it is a support level. Meaning there is almost no chance this thing dips more than a few $ without a serious catalyst. You have potential upside of $100+ with very little downside risk. 

They are going to start paying dividends again in 2021, which means yield on cost at these prices will likely be fantastic. That's huge. They are becoming the new becky supercenter with their new athleisure product lines and the Sephora deal as well which could lead to huge growth. They are going to capture market share from JcPenny and Macy's in the coming years as other retailers were caught on the backfoot by the virus. 

I predict this stock could go to ATH within a year due to pent up demand and new marketing initiatives.

No. Fed won‚Äôt let it happen.
Risk tolerance.. Index funds are highly diversified and work for a majority of people who prefer a low-maintenance, passive style of investing. With that relative stability of risk comes a relatively lower potential gain.. Generally, the higher the potential for failure for a given bet, the higher the risk, therefore theoretically the higher potential gain.. Rarely do you find massive losses on subs like r/investing, and likewise do you ever see massive gains. WSB in comparison, you see both massive gains and massive losses.
Ok is the stock name bitches or bigcock someone help!!

They‚Äôre slightly more risk than buying stock straight up. Obviously if the stock goes down the can expire worthless. If buying OTM, the stock could trend up early and then flatten out below your break even. Add in if you‚Äôre doing LEAPS on a dividend stock that your missing out on those.

Good news is you can run a variety of strategies to either reduce your cost basis or make income while the leap is in play. You would need 100x shares of a stock to sell calls normally, but you could sell further OTM calls and turn it into a PMCC 

The gains shouldn‚Äôt be expected in the same range as FD‚Äôs or short term trading and should be targeted more as an investment, I.e. 15-30%. Obviously timing matters on leaps as they aren‚Äôt decade long holds, so aim for entry at resistance  on the daily chart.
Don‚Äôt insult Idiocracy like that that. You‚Äôre tarded.
are you saying he turned a profit?!
[removed]
Only danger is opportunity cost and time value of money. If you put everything into 2023 leaps, and say in 3 months you're $20 ITM, are you really going to sell with 2 years left, esp if it's clear a winner? How are you going to get tendies in 2021 and 2022?

LEAPS are great but too smart for us to go all in on because we're impatient af, which is why we trade weeklies in the first place.
Just follow the red lines it‚Äôll lead you to heaven

TLDR
A couple of diametrically opposed thoughts encroaching on market outlook for the next 3 months -

\*we have a vaccine, we're saved

\*# of deaths expected to double from 275k-ish currently to about 500k in only 4 months, likely spawning more lockdowns

MMs likely to use either outlook to push the lines to the points that yields the most profits for them.  I expect a reasonably active kangaroo outlook, fairly unpredictable, with minor news having outsized influence on the indexes.

Eh, you have no point beyond and opinion. I see what you are getting at but my opinion is that it is not up to the government to tell people to be healthy. 

Do you get mad at Taco Bell when it gives you the shits? No, because you are accountable for the choices you make. Yet Diarrhea kills hundreds of thousands every year. 

I understand being proactive to not spread the illness but again, it is not the government's job to force citizens to stay healthy, it is the citizen's responsibility.
I know little about blue states, but people in red states will not accept a 2nd lockdown.

I made a nice profit buying RKT on IPO day and then dumping it shortly after.  Haven't really looked back since.   That was just one example of how IPOs spike and then drop.  Other examples are BYND, FB, GOOG (yeah I bought that one too).  Then the good ones go up and never stop.  As you say RKT is junk.  Time will tell for AirBnB.
‚ÄúAny profits I made would go to charity‚Äù

Green as fuck tomorrow in anticipation of this 908b stimulus. Airlines getting another 17b.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin looks like there‚Äôs going to be another serious lockdown and then they‚Äôll get the vaccines rolling after - but this might be a nice hammer blow to the market - although I think it‚Äôll be a lot less harsh then the earlier - now that the market realizes that tech only gains from lockdown - but I‚Äôm thinking maybe go short on rty because retail should gap down
With Covid and every other trash that 2020 has brought, I haven‚Äôt had the patience of getting into arguments. I simply just ghost the person, either for the day or long term, depending on who they are. Too much other shit to worry about.

I dont think of ta as rules, just quite interesting how often these things work out. My favorite indicator of price movement., so far, is a crossover of 13 amd 30 period sma on and hourly chart (13 is avout 2 trading days 30 is about 1 week). Especially if they have not crossed for a few weeks, and even more so when they are crossing the 200 period as well. Works for bullish and bearish. Of course the news drives the stonk cycle, but the algos buying in between def have some kind of equation for buy and sell. If only we could find it

Don't forget the fun of selling calls then watching the stock break out and jump 20 points, while you stare at your $22 in premium.  

Of course at that point, you could buy them back for 30x what you sold them at, or roll out and get stuck waiting for 9 months, during which time the stock pulls back to below your purchase price.

It's free money until it isn't.
true. but chasing 100x baggers are useless in my opinion. youll get the same way chasing 1/2-1x baggers and you can actually do it with skill instead of hitting a roulette table

Looking up AIRBNB
If it doesn't you are fucked, thats why its dangerous. Same issues as any call option, just spread out over more time. Look at the market since 2018, there have been lots of big drops... You leaps will rise and fall too. I prefer ATM leaps to hold long term because edit: "with a small price movement they become ITM and theta doesn't degrade ITM leaps" like OTM leaps, edit: " which I find provides a nice balance between the final break even price and managing theta". When it comes time all I have to do is pay my broker a small fee to exercise them and give me the cash in return.

The max pain point is on the top chart where the bars are smallest. This is the point most of the contracts will expire worthless. The further out you go, the option writers (usually Market-Makers) will lose more on their position so they have incentive to try and close the stock price closer to the 'max pain' strike price. This is just a theory and can never be proven. Personally I do believe it happens. Maybe not always, but sometimes.

You relate to people in your level, and that creates a safe environment to thrive.

Conflict isn't worth it unless you are certain of winning and willing to push your own limits.

I said to myself "I should start trading" for two years before I just started buying shit last year. Start small at first; I'm still learning and barely know anything compared to people who've done this for years but I can still tell some of my early moves were pants-on-head dumb.

There is nothing that can happen on this call that will send the core long thesis reeling, barring absolute management meltdown (we're burning all the money for warmth, figured it yielded the best shareholder return)

Agree that our date formatting sucks. I use yyyymmdd wherever I can. Fahrenheit does offer one benefit, it gives us something to argue about. Since it makes precision easier when it comes to the temps you care about, we argue about the ideal house temperature, 68 vs 69 degrees. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs all just a single number in Celcius.

In my area it‚Äôs super cheap. I get a weekly 10-20% off and free delivery so it‚Äôs like $3 more than going and doing it myself because of a tip.  I ordered food 2 days ago, checked on every app and called to check prices since I hadn‚Äôt been there before, it was all the same as DoorDash already had so I only paid for the tip of the driver extra.

If you‚Äôre not a dumbass it‚Äôs not expensive, they have coupons daily.  I only order food like once a month though because I‚Äôm not a degenerate and like cooking

On the bottom chart the right side y-axis is the value of premium expiring. Those colored bars at the bottom are the value of premium at the strike below max pain, at max pain, and strike above max pain. You can see a spike in volume of the bars every 4 weeks because of the amount of premium expiring on a weekly option contract vs that of a monthly option contract.

That's why I decided to track the premium as well because you will notice on a monthly or quarterly expiration (like qUaD wItChIng), the amount of premium expiring is exponentially larger than that of just a regular weekly contract. The next big expiration, actually quad witching, is Dec 18 which has huge amounts of premium related to options expiring.

Max pain theory is just a theory because it implies markets are manipulated to cause max pain. My theory with is it that MMs will let some of the weeklies expire at a loss for them as long as they can recoup some losses on the monthly and quarterly expirations. For example, a weekly option for SBUX might only have $10 million in premium expiring, whereas the quarterly and quad witching will have $1 billion expiring so they will focus more on driving price to Max Pain on the quarterly instead of the weekly with less premium.
How‚Äôs my VALE gang doing
Yeah i have April calls expiring

When do I give you my venmo dad?
50pip stop loss and 150pip take profit. A pip is one piece of the currency used to measure currency exchange. So in the example I gave the EURUSD at $1.2505, so a single pip would be where the *x* is in $1.250x. 

50 pips is a moderate stop loss, or an automatic close of a position on the downside that you set to minimize risk. 150 pips as a take profit is 3 times the stop loss, making for a moderate take profit, or an automatic close of a position on the upside to, again, minimize risk. 

Using $1.2505 again, a 50 pip stop loss (SL) would close the position at $1.2455, that way if the trade goes the wrong way you expected, you don‚Äôt lose your account. Your take profit (TP) would be at $1.2655, so you don‚Äôt get greedy and think ‚Äúoh it‚Äôll continue upwards‚Äù after moving 150 pips. 50/150 are good numbers for a solid strategy. Some people like to play with a little more risk and will opt for 75 SL and 150 TP, but it‚Äôs up to you. 

Hope this helps.
Not confident enough to buy LEAPS on anything at the moment but if I hear about a rising company that I expect is trading at low IV currently and anticipate a rise I'll look at them and research them in more detail.

I am watching some companies such as LAZR, BB, and CRSR

But I won't be trading them right this moment. I take a very cautious approach and try to stack all of the odds in my favor before entering a trade. That way I feel I'm less likely to be wrong, and when I am wrong, it's not a big deal because I'm not going all in on anything.

LEAPS give you a better chance at giving you a gain, but weeklies give you a chance at giving you massive gains with a 10x risk of losing it all. for every 1 leap that gives you a 10000x gain there were 100 weeklies everyday that did it

People will choose convenience over novelty every time, theaters will stick around but nowhere near the capacity they are at now. You literally can't compare Disneyland to theaters, those are tourist attractions that families will plan their vacation around. They bring in billions of dollars alone and build brand in a way that theaters can't live up to. Disneyland is an experience, theaters are a place to watch movies in the best quality possible. This is just a burden they don't need, it would be a bad business decision.

Generally when companies file, they intend on using it. It's a risk.

That's why I prefaced with " if you're playing shorter term". If you're holding 2 week OTM calls and they drop an offering, you're money is DOA.

Longer term calls and LEAP's are the play just as a precaution

Yes - but I am not sure why he would do that. 

The politics here aren't great. It is unlikely that treasury is going to strike a multi-billion dollar settlement with shareholders in the middle of COVID when the admin and congress can barely get their act together on stimulus spending. Plus this would unsettle the mortgage market which is a bright spot in the recovery. 

It is likely that SCOTUS will rule this whole Obama era regime unconstitutional. This is a ruling that Republicans welcome because it will set a precedent that hamstrings the Biden administration's power to do something similar. 

So at the end of the day - I agree that the current structure is coming to an end and that FNMA has the potential to pop, it just won't happen under the Trump admin. Look to Spring 2021 for the court to rule on this. Get in now if you think the price is attractive.

Exactly. People forget that what is often called "toxicity" "Negativity" or "Bullying" is just a natural and healthy response mechanism designed to reinforce pro-social behavior and discourage anti-social behavior. One of the reasons I'm concerned for Zoomers who never have to face anyone be mean to them and why I think Chris Christie's decision to ban bullying from schools is one of the worst decisions he made (besides giving out massive tax handouts to failing companies.)

Well this isn‚Äôt a bailout, it‚Äôs a buyout. And it‚Äôs not a failed business model as much as it suffers from government-imposed restrictions to help with the pandemic. Yes, streaming is gaining popularity, but the theater business is still big business. It makes movies *far* more profitable than streaming services due to ticket/concession sales, which means greater innovation and more jobs in film and production. For these reasons i‚Äôd argue that the government has a responsibility to allow theaters to be bought.
Huawei was the industry leader. Now that they are pretty much banned it‚Äôs left a big hole for Nokia and a few others to step in.

**[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism)**

The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism is a fictional book in George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). The book was supposedly written by Emmanuel Goldstein, the principal enemy of the state of Oceania's ruling party. The Party portrays Goldstein as a former member of the Inner Party who continually conspired to depose Big Brother and overthrow the government. In the novel, the book is read by the protagonist, Winston Smith who recalls that "There were ...

Yeah you'd need a miracle.  Maybe 300 for March or May.
The much higher SI and decreased shares outstanding will accelerate the move up vs the prior cycles. Should not take nearly as long to reach the peak. And this peak will be much higher than the last 2 cycles. >$100/share is within reach.

youtube idea;

get epic movie scenes from big name movies and change the soundtrack.. How cool would some interstellar music be for some star wars scenes?
This seems spot on from what I‚Äôve been looking at.

Looks like as much as a 10% correction coming up followed by another run up through 21 as industries recover to precovid levels.

However a correction may be minor, if any, as vaccines ramp up and stimulus is injected into the economy.  This is helped along by FEDs interest rates remaining low.

If they botch the stimulus bill before they go on leave the 18th, expect to see the downturn start.
Those spreads though üò©

You need $125.13 for break even right now.

If you think $125 is possible, you could sell the $126c for $0.61 as of right now, meaning you only need $124.52 for break even.

In this case, you‚Äôd be legging into a debit spread since they‚Äôll both expire on the same day.

The big question is whether 124 is going to hit for you or not.
I have no idea, but a 1% rise over the week is entirely possible.

Creating a spread would limit your potential payoff to $1 - net debit of $0.52, so $0.48/ contract.

If you think $125 is a sure thing, sell the $126c, or higher.

The market has risen pretty far from the most recent low in November, the rate of growth should start to slow. The question is do we see a 5% pull back before that happens. I don't think so. The market have been more volatile the last couple years and is more prone to larger movements both down and up, the turbulence in 2018, followed by the huge run in 2019, followed by more turbulence in 2020... and the pattern repeats. Get ready for lots of overvalued claims, record high valuation headlines, and doubt to become even more prominent (as hard as that is to believe). We will eventually have another large correction, at this rate its likely to be late January unless the market slows down a bit.

You're still able to view the historical data of the original strike, same way you can see the data of the post split strike.

But that matters much less than the fact that the guy has been commenting nonstop for the last 24 hours saying he's sent verification videos to "random jerk skeptics" while refusing to send it to anyone else that requests. Post the video or shut up about it. Saying that random people (who totally aren't alt accounts) have seen it proves nothing. He could easily share with a mod to verify but again, he's only sending video "proof" to randoms.

The guy put too much effort into avoiding requested verification while putting a ton of effort into bickering with the people asking for evidence. It doesn't add up unless he's full of shit

I know people with the type of money people like yourself would refer to as ‚Äúa billionaire‚Äù which in your terms means someone with exceedingly more than a couple million dollars. Saying you know specific people isn‚Äôt saying you speak like them. I‚Äôm saying you need to open your perspective to think more like them. I like how you try to act like everyone else has ego issues, but you fail to learn your ego says one thing but your bank account proves another. Keep talking about egos because in a world of haves and have nots, you definitely align with the have-nots of the world.

IV is an indicator of investor sentiment with regard to the probability of a price movement. The higher IV is, the more likely that the price of the security is going to change.

You also want to be familiar with IV Percentile (or similar depending on your platform). I use think or swim and it shows the 52-week high and low as well as percentile for the year, in the options chain.

To extrapolate on that:

If you're talking about High vs Low IV of a specific security, you want to use IV Percentile as well as historical High and Low IV. If you're comparing the IV of two different securities, you can just use IV.

I know this stupid, but I opened a tiny long put position on TSLA on Friday. Following Michael Burry. He is right about GME & called 08.
What life?
Look at his comments. He is a GME short seller, and is trying to get people off the boat so he doesn't lose a ton of money. He is trying to delude himself just as much as he accuses others of.
Use for nothing but Jan or feb AVTR $30 c

If I sell a Put on Robinhood for 12/11, and I only have enough money for the collateral if I include the Robinhood margin,  do I have I pay interest on the margin during the week?

I'm not sure what you mean but what I'm saying is that historical option data for TSLA (or even APPL) on many of these websites are wrong because of the split. 

The you'd need Thinkback on TOS or find a broker that properly tracks options data in both pre and post split.

That's why for this website, that data looks fucked, they ended up combining charts from what another redditor said.
Godspeed. Vix is usually not a long term play that hedge funds use because over time it just goes to zero but sounds like you understand that

I didnt follow the details. Aren't they still pretty fat from years and years of subsidies? I'm talking about the folks that have been completely gutted and are facing generational poverty and a life of meth / fent to escape the pain. If they wake up realize it wasnt the "n*gger in the White House" who fucked them but nameless faceless plutocrats and corporate oliogopolists, shit might get real. Then again, that's why the drugs are allowed to flow into the communities, to keep them dumbed down, sick and placid.

You try to act as if you‚Äôre smart but you fail to bring up any information that makes me think you graduated high school.

‚ÄúFrom the moment I joined Reddit I have had no intention to post information‚Äù yet you try to say you will compare statements with me but don‚Äôt have the balls to back it up when asked to provide proof. Probably the same reason you were denied a mortgage(couldn‚Äôt provide proof of income).

Put: Right to sell 100 shares at the strike price you choose and expiration date you choose

Example: Buy 1 AAPL call $130 Strike 12/11. If AAPL closes at $140 you make $1000 ((140-130) * 100)

There are tons of articles contradicting your, as you say, anecdote. 

Of course demand in major population dense cities is down since there is nothing open and its high risk for covid, but it's soaring elsewhere rural and more secluded getaway type places, perhaps not for the holidays as much but we don't know that yet. Post Covid demand will be higher than ever. 

You have no valid argument that I see, again, it's as simple as googling COVID AirBnB demand to see A LOT of support behind the company and their future potential

Why are two Virgin shills making identical wrong arguments in two different reply threads to the same post? I'll tell you exactly what I told the Joey guy. Virgin has demonstrated zero capability to compete with SpaceX. Starship's projected launch cadence and capability vastly outstrips all satellite production in the world, so if tourists want to pay for a Starship launch there's no reason it won't happen. You have this set idea in your mind as to what Starship "is for" without understanding that rapid reusablity makes Starship the DC-3 of rockets.

Someone on here suggested grabbing 1/15 80c and I did and I think you whoever that was. It‚Äôs up over 100% now and they were cheap to buy!
If I cash out some shit in the next few months imma try that and see what I get.
Damn, is buying shares and selling covered calls just free money? Buy 100 shares at $31.52 then sell a 05/21/21 covered call for $7.90. If it gets exercised you made 50%, if it stays under $40 your cost basis is like $23.62
Yup. DXY is below 91 now and it‚Äôll likely break below 90 soon enough. There‚Äôs no incentive for the big money to be on cash or bonds. The only other thing giving a similar return as stocks are shitcoins, but the risk there is much much higher. Hence, stocks have become the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù bet.
My January 30c are bleeding right now, but I‚Äôll hold. It‚Äôs the kind of stock that can randomly have a 50% week. Float is basically locked up by institutions so a little buying pressure goes a long way.

 Index funds with nearly identical portfolio mixes and investing strategies can have different fee structures. Some index funds charge [front-end loads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/front-endload.asp), which are¬†[commissions¬†](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp)or sales charges applied upfront when the initial purchase of an investment occurs. Other funds charge [back-end loads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/back-end-load.asp), which are charges and commissions that occur when the investment is sold. Other fees include [12b-1 fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/12b-1fees.asp), which are annual distribution or marketing fees for the fund. However, the 12b-1 fee can be charged separately or be embedded within the fund's expense ratio.

Ive been debating all weekend if I should find a lower stress but lower paying job since I am consistently making way more trading than I have been working. 

I loved my job and was making great money, but they cut my overtime and now im starting to get crap about not being as productive.I get called on my day off to be bitched at about why something got scheduled for monday, they wanted it done on friday. When you take away 20% of my work hours, I get >20% less done while working, who could have guessed. Either give me back my hours(which at this point I don't want, Id rather leave at 2:30 and make a days salary in the next hour) or hire another person.
Okay, first of all, you're just wrong about what Starship is "for". Starship has an estimated launch cost in the single digit millions. If someone wants to pay for orbital tourism, they'll get orbital tourism. If someone wants to launch 100 tons of ice just for the sake of launching ice, ice shall be launched. Starship's orbital capacity will vastly outstrip all demand for years, they aren't going to turn away paying customers.

Secondly, although competitors exist, in order to compete you need to *be competitive*. Virgin Galactic has shown zero capability to compete with SpaceX. RocketLab is closer to competing with them. SpaceX is building a Saturn V sized rocket that will still be the cheapest ride to orbit, and they're in the final stages of development. The engines work, the aerodynamics are mostly settled, and they're rapidly prototyping vehicles. They've built 15 Starship test articles so far.

What does Virgin have that makes you honestly think they can compete? What evidence is there that the "orbital spaceship" has left the drawing board in any meaningful way? To develop an engine that competes with Raptor would take years, maybe a decade.

If he exercises the calls he gets 2000 TSLA shares, currently at ~$600.. 600*2000 = 1.2 million.

If he sells the contracts he makes $926,000.

So this is one of those instances where it‚Äôs much better to exercise the calls than just selling them. But he‚Äôs a millionaire either way. Problems I wish I had lmfao

Decides to sell to diversify or secure profits, stock goes up 10% the next day.
True, might make more sense to wait until it settles a bit, but I think long term gains could make up for a potential IV crush. I'm tempted to get in ASAP just because I can see a lot of hysteria pumping the stock in the short term before a level off, I want to lock in those gains... I'm sure it will experience more periods of high IV that might be even higher than the IV it's currently seeing (which is high, yeah, but the stock traditionally has high IV).  Probably leaps for 7/16/2021 or Jan 2022 (they're expecting more clinical trial news sometime in 2021). Not sure though, it depends how crazy things get before open Monday. I'm on the fence. Might just buy some shares Mon and hope for a drop in IV  to get into 2022 leaps.
Yes but you saw the effect mass hysteria and feedback loops can have on the market in March, at which point retail made up a much smaller percentage of the market. Since retail is more easily influenced by mass hysteria, if there is another major sell off like in March, the outcome would be worse. As such, assuming everything is priced in is a dangerous game.
The stock market is not the sum of an economy, many many businesses are not public and not in the stock market - nearly all small businesses, and a couple large ones.

> fuckery if the value drops too low 

If you mean a margin call they're required by law, not Robinhood.

The legal maximum on leverage is 50% but a broker can set those limits lower based each stock. Like TD only does (or did when I last checked) 30% on Disney.
It is known
Yes. I prefer buying OTM personally.

I've made >300% gains on premium by trading INTC $70c when INTC was below $50 and not expected to even reach $70

Just because. 

It doesn't have to be ITM to make money with this strategy. 

And the increase in value can be huge with very little underlying change sometimes.

This is why high volume stocks with >10 million average volume are good because of liquidity and being able to get in and out of these contracts.

If you're trying this on stocks with too few people involved then you might be stuck holding contracts without buyers. So I aim for stocks like INTC that have even greater than 25 million average volume

I sure hope so. Don‚Äôt bail out a failing business model. Capitalism 101. Just because AMC goes under doesn‚Äôt mean that the theaters they lease or own disappear, it doesn‚Äôt mean that the projectors and the screens, etc just disappear. Someone else can come along, re-invent and innovate the theater industry (or whatever the next iteration of it is), and then the economy and consumers are better off. Watching movies is not going to disappear tomorrow because AMC goes under retard.

It‚Äôs the same shit with airlines. Don‚Äôt give them billions for being over-leveraged and not appropriately managing their finances. It incentivized tired, old, un-inventive, and anti-innovative practices that suppresses long term growth. And long term growth is the only thing that matters. Let the shitty businesses fail and let someone better take their place

Edit: I guess I agree they could be bought up, just not by Disney because of anti-trust shit. And if it‚Äôs between them failing and dealing with anti-trust, let them fail and have someone start over in their place. Gay monopoly is more problematic long term than a failed theater

Ballsy and/or lucky. I assume you bought after their 2nd earnings dump. Sentiment around INTC was that they‚Äôre ruined by bad mgmt and losing their footing for 6 months, so shitty earnings weren‚Äôt really an overreaction, and they rightfully traded sideways for over a month after that. Even AWS with whom they have this new partnership that served as a catalyst for this recent run is actually moving away from Intel processors to cheaper alternatives. Why is INTC all of a sudden a ‚Äúhot‚Äù company is beyond me. The only logic for such moves would be reversion to mean.

More seriously - why didn‚Äôt you buy leaps, if you believed in INTC, but bet that they‚Äôll recover in only 2 months? They‚Äôve basically recovered most of their post-earnings losess in the last 2 weeks. Would that have been more or less profitable?

Why do you guys buy calls and not just buy shares and hope it goes up?

I don't know \*much\* about trading , would appreciate if someone would explain to a simple pleb

It is the same. You can have short and long term unrealized gains in 2020. As long as you don‚Äôt sell the stock in 2020 you don‚Äôt have to pay tax
All good. If you have 400 shares, you can sell 4 contracts of PLTR (covered call). 

For instance, as of Friday's close, you could sell the 12/24 $35 for $55 apiece. It would both give you some cash ($55 x 4 = $210) and lower your cost basis from $32.50 to $31.95.

The risk, of course, is that if PLTR rose past $35 in the next 3 weeks (I think unlikely), but if it did your shares would be called away and you would be left with a total profit of $1210.

The upside is that you can sell calls every few weeks and make money while chipping away at your cost basis.

Now you're claiming they'll go from zero to competitive with Starship in four years? Bullshit.

Yeah I am pretty passive these days but when I was more into it I was just kinda trying to think of myself as a mutual fund manager, thinking about sector allocation at a high level and then trying to pick some winners from within each area (although let‚Äôs be honest it was 80% tech).

In January we might get 10% of the population vaccinated while we might actually get 10K dead per day 2 weeks after Christmas.

It would have been more like a few weeks. I bought 17 $73 12/11 Calls at .43 like the day after Amazon's announcement cause CVS was down and they crashed to as low as .15 just a few days after. Nice payoff though if only I hadn't sold half when i was breaking even but gains are gainsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Okay but even so, the guy holding 75% of the bag controls the action. That‚Äôs my whole point. MMs are constantly hedging positions and buying new shit, and if they don‚Äôt want it to go higher it doesn‚Äôt. Retail can‚Äôt drive up the market alone. Banks are along for the ride too and will basically veto price action if they don‚Äôt want it going higher. They‚Äôre called Market makers for a reason.

interesting interpretation of the Gulag, I like it
Yes, 90% of the plays I take ive used flowalgo one way or another to choose that play.

The problem is that alot of people dont have the time to do what I do, which makes things harder. But I stare at flowalgo every. single. day for 6 hours. Its literally on my third monitor 24/7. You also need to be able to read option chains, and know how the money is flowing. Once you get good at the game, its not too hard to understand if options are being sold/bought/hedged etc. Sometimes it is, but othertimes its clear as day. 

I am a big believer in just following the money. If I see an unusual amount of call activity on one ticker on flow algo, especially if its a smaller named stock on a red day, or has a bearish chart it usually flickers lightbulbs in my brain. A recent example of this is VALE. I cant tell you the amount of buying I saw on Vale a week ago while it had a -5% day, jumping into plays like these with no other background dd but just from flowalgo has never failed me yet. (it doesnt happen often, but when it does Ill notice it)(and i dont all in every play, i follow risk management rules etc. im here for the long term)

Since that day in a week vale has jumped almost 2$ (~20%)

I was also seeing similar buying in Uber/lyft over the last week of november which I jumped in. (look at it now)

Sometimes I will use it to confirm my own watchlist plays. But the highest success rate Ive had is literally looking for mass call buying on stocks that have bearish momentum or a deep red day. And the reason for this is because usually when a stock is dying I will always see put flows coming in. When I see a stock on a -6% red day with 100% bullish call volume, it means INSTANT BUY.

That's for business and individuals. For individuals all that matters if you expect to owe over $1000 in yearly extra taxes from non salary income. If so then the IRS requires you to pay quarterly or face a penalty.

Gonna buy some GME 5p expiring 2022 at market open.
I do not need a roommate, I live in a four story house on the Hudson. Thanks for the offer though. 30 minimum hold sucks yeah, but I can still sell covered calls to lock in profits if I want so it's kind of like the minimum hold isn't even there.
Ecommerce rev is usually given a 2x or higher multiple by the market. GME will have 1.3bn-1.5bn in ecomm sales. That alone equates for about 3bn in valuation, or $32/share. These sales account for <20% of total sales.

B&M 4.5bn rev at 0.45x will equal another 2bn in valuation, plus 800m in cash, plus inventory = 3bn+

There is your 6bn+ market cap. Or $100/share. This is not giving GME any sort of special treatment or high multiples. It's just fair market valuations given their revenue numbers.

Unprofitability, shorting, negative sentiment, and covid had driven this stock into the ground. Now it seems as if all of these things have changed or are changing for the better. Total company turn around is delivering good results so far.

Don't forget to factor in Ryan Cohen and his plan to grow GME into a ecommerce category killer. That is where even further speculation and growth comes into play.

TLDR GME will be over $100 within 12 months for many reasons. This does not account for a squeeze.

But yes
But there will be, the question is what?
I feel you, and that is a possibility, that's why this is stocks, there is no predictable future besides opinions, a lot can change what happens to companies even out of their control and out of the market's control.

But I am Bullish on Intel and I do not believe the bear sentiment is justified. They will go up, even if they're failing, because they're Intel. That's just how it has been for companies too big to fail historically.

Besides when I read this kind of news, I'm very confident about INTC going forward:

> Rising competition will always be a problem. But Intel has so much more manpower, resources and experience than anyone else in the CPU game. The company should be able to leverage those advantages to formidably defend its leadership position over the next few years. So, while Intel may never again enjoy a monopoly of the CPU space like it did five years ago, the company will forever remain a very important player in this market.

> And losing ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù status is just fine, because the semiconductor market is on the cusp of enormous growth throughout the 2020s, as we increasingly pivot to a technology-driven society built on the back of CPU chips. So long as Intel stabilizes market share in that booming market, revenue growth trends will remain healthy.

> Meanwhile, gross margin pressures will ease as Intel finally scales 7-nanometer chip production in 2022. Brining these chips to market will help Intel win back higher-quality, higher-margin business, and will therefore, provide a material boost to the company‚Äôs overall gross margin profile.

> Big picture: Intel is down, but certainly not out. Over the next few years, this company will bounce back from what appears like a very precarious position today. As it does, INTC stock will rebound with vigor.

https://investorplace.com/2020/10/unimpressive-intel-earnings-are-no-deal-breaker-for-intc-stock/

> But Intel‚Äôs stability might be better suited for our current market and it is prepared for the future. ‚ÄúOne year into our long-term financial plan, we have outperformed our revenue and EPS expectations,‚Äù CEO Bob Swan said in prepared Q4 remarks.

If you‚Äôre gonna leverage yourself, why not buy shares, sell otm covered weeklies and use some backup money to buy leverage against your own position through puts? Personally, I don‚Äôt mind wedge trading, but Tesla‚Äôs IV is so high for anything expiring before January that it‚Äôs really negligible from a % standpoint unless Tesla has another -7% and +8% days back to back allowing you to play the volatility both ways on a wedge.

lmfao I know right. & there‚Äôs a bunch of confused people in this thread calling this fake because I suspect they also don‚Äôt know how to read this.

There was a 5:1 split between the time he bought this (Summer 2019) and now. So we can find this call‚Äôs strike price at purchase from the breakeven - cost ((136.23 - 0.23)*5X split) = $680 strike.

These were TSLA 680c 1/15/21 bought Summer 2019 when TSLA was trading for like $220. Way way out the money with a year and a half of theta. 

Now that we know the strike we can check it out ourselves, and the Open Interest is 22,000+, which means that while OP owns 20 of these calls there‚Äôs still 21,980 of them still being held out there

Nobody is a bull on q3 er specifically. I think everybody expects doodoo EPS, but if the guidance is good, then forward-looking confidence will keep the stock within the current range. 

I disagree with the retards that think some massive squeeze is pending; the share float is way too high and smart money can unwind slowly. But I also disagree with the people who ignore the strong fundamentals. GME is cash positive and actively transitioning to meet a lot of their weaknesses. 

I don't expect some massive spike but I do think it's undervalued and for that reason I'm long
Any predictions for pfe this week? Does it seem like it‚Äôs still undervalued with stock price

Hate all you want but INTC makes bank and is way undervalued, $21B net income TTM (more than FB 1/4 the market cap) Buy long term calls, cheap, could see it going to $70 next year.

Yes also worth noting that China and Europe both tried to clone Airbnb for ten years and largely failed. Wimdu was a super well funded German competitor which went under entirely.

https://skift.com/2018/09/27/airbnb-clone-wimdu-to-close-despite-having-raised-more-than-90-million/

I think they‚Äôre trying to revive the brand but it‚Äôs really sad
IMO both are bad but bioshock has a better story.
It really [doesn't ](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/08/07/more-pain-than-gain-how-the-us-china-trade-war-hurt-america/) , it cost the USA 1.7 trillion at the time of the article and a little over 1% gdp. They might be making a bit at the border taking in tarrifs, but they're hurting more on the back end. IMO incentivising production to move or stay in USA should have been explored more heavily before discentivicing importing those goods.
Gotcha so big options are not a thing for me
I thought it would dip more, and then I never got in :/
i work in a travel industry, and let me tell you. Bf this covid shit, travel industry was one of the industries that were expected to grow the fastest + largest, mainly bc of small home vacational rentals businesses pouring out.. thanks to airbnb.

Sounds like the typical ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have‚Äù type of personality. Also, trying to repeatedly talk about my parents‚Äô taxes shows how extremely jealous you are of how I had a good upbringing while you likely had to worry about getting shot while you sleep(reference to living in the ghetto).

Yea Airbnb is going to fuck themselves into the Stone Age between bullshit fees and thumbing their noses at legislators in big cities. The city I live in, my parents tiny little beach town and every other city worth visiting has community groups that actively campaign against Airbnb.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt a ton of money to be made off of them.

I‚Äôd use the sand wedge here, not the driver. Make a brief, small play and try to catch a December tax loss harvesting selloff. Promise yourself you‚Äôll get away from this idea if this play fails. 

Otherwise, you‚Äôll get well into 2021, hoping a crash allows you to get back to break even, so you can exit this shit. Then the crash will happen and you‚Äôll be like ‚Äúfuck yeah this is the BIG ONE I KNEW WAS COMING.‚Äù So you‚Äôll hold, hoping for monumental gainz. The dip will be bought, and you‚Äôll be right back to fucked, but far more depressed that you got greedy. Then you‚Äôll sell on the next minor dip for a 70% loss on this trade.
Nothing will stop it

-Sell the news.
-The fact that GameStop is a joke of a company and is incredibly outdated. You ever been in one? Smells like cheese
with about 2k id buy 100 pltr and sell a dec 31 call for 30, make 5%, or if it gets called away make 31%, then repeat. I'm not sure how i feel about selling puts here though, too easy to miss out on appreciation.

When did you purchase them and how did you catch the entry just day two prior to it took off? Yes I know it was over sold but what indication gave you the that big rally..? EMA cross over?
I don't, that's certain, but the only examples of what I'm looking for, that I've seen, cost a fucking TON+/
The only way we get a stimulus is from Mitch's cold dead hands, he likely won't even pass his own stimulus deal. That one is just for looks, watch dems agree to 500b and he puts a 1b on the table.

It's much harder for the gay bear parade to sucker punch a company with 500b mkt cap as opposed to one that is a 40b cap.
Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. You would pay tax as if the 10k was standard pay in the first example.

Venture capitalist Nick Hanauer, Politico Magazine 2014:

‚ÄúWhat everyone wants to believe is that when things reach a tipping point and go from being merely crappy for the masses to dangerous and socially destabilizing, that we‚Äôre somehow going to know about that shift ahead of time. Any student of history knows that‚Äôs not the way it happens. Revolutions, like bankruptcies, come gradually, and then suddenly. One day, somebody sets himself on fire, then thousands of people are in the streets, and before you know it, the country is burning. And then there‚Äôs no time for us to get to the airport and jump on our Gulfstream Vs and fly to New Zealand. That‚Äôs the way it always happens. If inequality keeps rising as it has been, eventually it will happen. We will not be able to predict when, and it will be terrible‚Äîfor everybody. But especially for us.‚Äù




Millions of Americans set to be foreclosed on, evicted, lose unemployment benefits, lose their small business while Wall Street financiers simultaneously throw a massive orgy of speculation and astronomical excess. Need a stronger virus to keep the public scared and submissive or this powder keg might blow.

Anyone trade the XLI? Industrials will be a big winner in 2021
I tell people buying an option is like renting a stock with an option to buy. You pay the owner some amount of money and he lets you hold the stock for a period of time (expiration).  If the stock goes past the agreed price (strike), you can sell the option and keep the extra money. So your profit is current price - strike price - option price that you paid the owner. If you wait until expiration and you like the stock, you can buy it at the agreed strike price.
so the fda taking the device of the market is not hurting the company?-especially when a shitton of their revenue comes from products related to the jet 7?
I can‚Äôt find the exact article that compared it directly but you can see the two numbers:

https://thinkrealty.com/airbnb-bouncing-back-ipo/

For hotels through August: ‚ÄúSince mid-February hotels have lost more than $46 billion, occupancy rates are at less than 35%, and 70% of hotel employees have been laid off or furloughed.‚Äù

https://wtop.com/business-finance/2020/12/airbnb-hopes-to-raise-2-6b-in-mid-december-ipo/

For Airbnb: ‚ÄúThe number of nights and experiences booked, which plummeted more than 100% in March and April, were down 28% in July, August and September.‚Äù


So by these numbers hotels were down 65% in occupancy in August and got rid of 70% of employees

Airbnb was down only 28% going back to June and as widely reported got rid of 25% of employees

They‚Äôre doing a LOT better

You pay me money, so that for a limited amount of time, you can, but don't have to, buy or sell 100 shares of a company at a different price than the current price.

If the current price is $110, and you have a call option that lets you buy at $100, you can buy 100 shares at $100 but immediately sell them for $110. Instant profit.

Check out the videos linked at the bottom Adam can explain it much better than I can.

Not a 100% sure but I think your brokerage firm covers it? And then the originator of the contract owes money to the brokerage firm.

üö® Question(s) for Tax nerds üö®

If you have say, $10k realized short term gains EOY, and you‚Äôre a loser fuck with no other income, would the standard deduction apply to that and you‚Äôd pay basically 0 in tax? 

Also, same scenario, but you aren‚Äôt a loser fuck, and you *do* have other income, if you contribute $10k before the year ends to a tax deferred account, would that offset the 10k in realized gains?
Thanks. I‚Äôll just let it get called away. Been bag holding PFE for 3 months. Average cost 38. Worst investment I have made this year. Thought it was going to moon on vaccine news.

- December tax loss selloff coming  
- 2k deaths per day, 1 mil cases per day and Christmas/New Year holidays not even hit yet. The new administration wont sit around like the old one did.  
- vaccine does not cover all strains of COVID. The Balrimore Ravens found 4 different strains within their own team at once.

I don't follow the stock but from a look at the charts... it's been on a couple $8 runs within the last year that happened in periods shorter than a month. Everything I can see is pointing toward it currently in the midst of a run.

Personally, I'd take the $1k gamble. OP, that looks like a fking bargain for being so possible. What made you dig through intel options prices?
stimulus? everything with a fat emphasis on airlines assuming they're included in the package

vaccine? recovery and travel stocks go up and if stimulus doesn't pass then possibly a tech dip too  (i hope)

Employment status is distinctly *not* a requirement as it is not uncommon to be unemployed and have earned income. Any earned income at any time can be contributed despite being unemployed. The statement, ‚Äúnot if you are unemployed‚Äù is wrong and you even know it.
Okay but if your making it out for a year later there must be a decent chance it will hit or go over??

Lot of fucking questions here...

Debit spread =you pay to open

Credit spread=you are paid to open

Max profit on debit spread is difference between the strikes minus the capital needed to open the position. If its a $1 difference between strikes and you pay $.5($5) to open, max profit is $95 minus commissions and fees.

Max profit is reached when the underlining is trading above the sold strike price.

Deep ITM option spreads do make money just not much. Buying a $580 Tesla call and selling the next strike, $582.5 will cost $1.47($147) with a max profit of $1.03($103) where as a $625/$630 spread costs $1.40(140$) and a max profit of $360.

I actually don't know if it's a FINRA regulation or just an internal insider trading compliance thing. I work as an engineer for huge trading applications and get details on thousands of trades per day so everything I do has to be pre cleared.

Also, anything that I do trade I have to hold for a minimum of 30 days. I've found that the best way for me to lock in profits on something that I want to sell is to just sell ITM covered calls :)

Yeah the other dude didn‚Äôt read the details. They ramped up Google Ads in 2019 and found they didn‚Äôt help that much so they cut them in 2020 to save money since travel was slowed anyway. When their business bounced back much quicker than expected, they realized the Google marketing spending was largely a waste and decided not to pay for it going forward

They gained market share on hotels this year so all signs indicate its working well.
Consider yourself lucky is the catch, congrats.
That is an absolutely fair take. You could very well be right. I think the Republicans will win both run off races, but obviously it is going to be so so close. It is probably true that the markets are brushing off this possibility way too much. As if a little more stimulus would be worth 35% corporate tax rates, higher investment taxes, etc. the additional gov spending would in no way compensate for all of the economic headwinds that they would pass into law.

It's legit, confirmed publicly by the DoD, CIA, military veterans, and members of congress that oversaw our defense budgets from both sides of the aisle. It's pretty crazy that they've been releasing a steady stream of information on this since, I believe, December 2017 and most people are just yawning. I guess now that it's not a conspiracy anymore it's not as exciting?

where you got that
cohen takeover / good q4 results. this earnings supposed to be meh but could possibly trigger cohen takeover without good forward guidance. hopefully they mention how the consoles have been selling on the call. i cant imagine the price has risen so much this past month solely because people expect good q3 results - that would be retarded. i think people are getting in solely for next quarter, so i don't personally expect much of a sell off.

1. Yes you are correct.

4. Idk but it‚Äôs the only way I could afford Tesla calls so that‚Äôs what I did. Of course the one time I do it I buy $500/510 and it rockets to 600.

Not a good idea for a number of reasons. 3x leveraged ETF‚Äôs are designed primarily for day trading/swing trading. If you want to mess with options, best to stick to a non leveraged etf. In addition, puts generally yield a higher return than calls. So even if you were right, and didn‚Äôt get IV crushed or burned by theta, it would be a smarter idea to buy puts on the 3x ETF rather than calls on the inverse. Between QQQ, TQQQ, and SQQQ, the smartest play would be to buy puts on QQQ. You shouldn‚Äôt really mess with options on the 3x ETFs
Awesome!

Missed your post but good timing. Tuesday auction should be very interesting. Considering bolstering OTM positions in ER!C. QC0M already made my account back.
Basically the idea of reversion to the mean is that stocks tend to return to a price that they were previously at after events. For instance let's say a clinical trial went badly, so the stock dumps 40%, it will, over time, likely regain some of that (I always say half) so 20% would be my price target. The same is true with bumps; the cannabis stocks are doing that now, go up a lot, drift down; price target is about 20% so you would buy puts to that and move on.
Expect -30% downside risk at worst imo

Don't be attached to the shares. You profit either way with an extra premium from the call itself. Then you switch to the cash secured puts to potentially get the shares back at a lower price if you so choose if its a rather volatile stock. Or just buy back in at the new PT if you feel it has too much support at the higher price. Stocks could also always go to 0 even if you like the prospects of the company. Anythibg is possible this is just conservative money making without YOLOing everything on a SPAC

There is a scientific proof that states the pain when you lose is greater than the high when you win.  That's why you remember losses more than wins, and this affects your behavior negatively.
Get out of here with those reasonable takes.  I don‚Äôt think your attainable goals of that type of mixed economy (minor tweaks to the current US economy) are far fetched.  Private property rightS are a must and will continue to be protected. The safety net talk,  seems like a big part of the current problem is the failure for the government spending to adequately or actually maximize many of the current ‚Äúsafety-nets‚Äù programs.  Actual education investment that provides better employment prospects (at CC/trade schools/universities), rather than a lot of wasted investment.  Can‚Äôt even pretend to know a lot about health care, outside of the ACA providing me 2 years of coverage as I found my career.  Failed programs are just a productivity suck and too much political capital tied to them.  

Capitalism or more free-market economics is always going to produce more innovation than a centrally planned economy.  The centrally planned economy under the right leadership is going to be more efficient. I completely agree about Rand and the ignoring of many of other lessons (value for value, skin in the game); but do love the hero entrepreneur mentality.  It seems like with basic needs covered responsibly (healthcare) then we would have increased in entrepreneurship and thus more US based innovations.  For me it seems like the economic populism coming from the left is marginally better suited/ more likely to get some programs in place and boost innovation.  On the right I see a lot of accusations of socialism and economic populist talk, but no real action towards facilitating new entrepreneurs.  Could just also be due to last four years being team red in charge and I forgot team blue doesn‚Äôt actually move the needle much (if at all) when they are in charge.

Vaccine DD:

Moderna can do 125 million doses in first quarter so 62 million people can be vaccinated 

Pfizer: 50 million in December = 25 million people
1.3 billion in 2021. Let's say production gradually rises next year so first three months is: 60 million in january, 70 million in feb, 80 million in march = 210 million doses = 105 million people vaccinated

Total vaccinated people at the end of Q1 is around 192 million, although probably lower because might take a few weeks before a produced vaccine is inserted

"Moderna Inc., which has also submitted a messenger RNA-based vaccine to the FDA for emergency clearance, said in a statement on Thursday it would have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first quarter of 2021."

Right, the municipal restrictions are what people keep trumpeting, but remember the same thing about Uber 7-8 years ago? They ended up making It work. Unlike Uber, Airbnb is already in 220 countries. They can absolutely afford to lose some revenue in some cities and continue to grow in others because they are everywhere already though nascent in many markets. Long-term viability will not be decided by a few cities or countries rental/lodging codes. Many titans have geographic areas they can‚Äôt break through or into. Walmart has consistently struggled abroad. Target too. Firearm manufacturers face restrictions in many countries, etc.  Those companies, if well-run, either adapt, lobby, or focus their energies in more profitable areas. 

Actual concerns about long-term profitability:
1. Global economic recovery - it already is incredibly uneven. The broader the recovery in the US industries, the better. Printing tendies in joke valuations in us markets doesn‚Äôt help many people travel. The US is lucky to be able to brrrr most countries cannot. This will hurt discretionary spending. This hurts airbnb. 

2. International conflict. Historically follows economic downturns as scarcity forces aggression for limited resources. Any of this hurts air bnb in affected regions. 

3. Covid recovery. Much like the economy, vaccine rollout will be uneven and favor developed nations with functional health care systems and an educated populace. Lack of access to or refusal to take vaccine will slow travel recovery in these areas. US could well be one of these with its 6th grade educated populace. Any lengthening of Covid era hurts Airbnb. 

4. Moats are lower than other household names and poachers know how to doppelg√§ng good ideas. China will undoubtedly copy the concept with its own state-backed or culturally embraced company. That‚Äôs a big market to lose significant share in. Last I remember reading Uber was still doing OK in the country with a similar story in India, but not the level of market dominance you want to become Amazon level ubiquity and global dominance. 

Those are what I see as true exposure, short and long. That said, I‚Äôm still totally hot for the stock‚Äôs long-term growth and will be buying over the first 6 months-1 year, even knowing the above concerns because it‚Äôs clear Airbnb will overcome them and the inevitability of them either being bought by a Marriott, Booking or vice versa to achieve total market dominance is a foregone conclusion for me. Buy and hold and buy more.
There may be 100s of ways to use it correctly, but you found one that doesn't work. You have also severely overestimated the power of your goading. You caught me, I am too poor for a mortgage. Did you forget you made a play on "slice" in the beginning of the sentence, or did you think it was so clever that you intentionally used it again at the end of the sentence?
Lol you‚Äôre sitting here telling everyone this is just like Uber which is at all time highs and worth $97 BILLION

Yes that‚Äôs right if people bought the Uber IPO you hate so much they‚Äôd have made major profits even before selling covered calls. This is despite a pandemic that shuttered their entire core business. But keep sitting here telling us how Uber IPOed without profits and it was doomed to fail

TLDR you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about and you‚Äôre just talking shit and being an asshole ü§°

Fannie on wsb? What is this, 2016?
Yes. For a call, you‚Äôd rather buy at the strike price and then sell the shares at the current price (which is above your strike price) for a profit.

For a put, you‚Äôd rather sell at the strike price and buy the shares at the current price (which is below your strike price). 

For put, which seems a little more confusing. Think about buying 100 shares at $2/share knowing you have the option to sell them to someone else for $10/share. 

Keep in mind, assuming there is liquidity in the options, you can always sell the option to someone else before expiration so you don‚Äôt need to buy or sell the underlying shares. 

As we talked about, the premium should have adjusted to reflect the changes in the underlying stock price. So you should be able to recognize the profit without going through the work of exercising the option and purchasing or selling the underlying shares.

What you‚Äôre basically going to do is put your foot down and say ‚Äúright now the economy ends‚Äù do you really feel you‚Äôve done enough research to accurately Time the peak? If not then wait for real news to act on and see if investor sentiment shifts. In the long term you may be right but in the short term buyer sentiment will remain the same and for the most part the market will move upwards, making your position cheaper. So why not wait to time it and buy lower

By all means try that strategy. Let me know how it works for you.

I hate to admit it, but I think the only one who predicted this was that prick Portnoy.
How much bragging is too much bragging?
yes but it doesnt work blindly. you need to understand option chains a little and be able to have a educated 'guess' if options are actually being bought vs used as a hedge, part of a spread and being sold etc. 

ive developed a working strategy and i have like a 95% success rate so far. but its a bull market so even blind moneys are geniuses.

ill wait till a bearish downturn to see if i can keep this up
Yeah, he does

I agree business travel will never return to pre pandemic levels. Travel relies on two things: fear/willingness and ability to pay/travel. There is a willingness but less means to travel in 2021. Airbnb supply is/was largely people renting their place while traveling for business or a second/third residence. What happens when foreclosures go through the roof? Reduced supply. Who gets government bailout money? Big business (hoteliers), not individual landlords/Airbnb owners. I suppose we‚Äôll have to agree to disagree here. I get your point but there are too many headwinds and ways for their business to unwind for me.
It‚Äôs gonna be yuge
gooba gobba one of us we accept him one of us
Disclaimer: I just stated i don‚Äôt know a thing about options. And I‚Äôve never really made it that far. I sell the contract before it expires and have never executed one. But....

The contract is the right to buy a given amount of shares at the strike price by a certain date. Exercising the option will buy those shares at the strike price and you will be sitting on the shares you bought the contracts for and minus the money to buy them. But will be sitting on potential gains as you can now sell those shares for the market value, which should be atleast high enough above the strike price you bought to break even. That price target should probably be figured out before buying the options, but yolo.
Just a reminder that the year is almost over retards.

And the tax-man wants his cut.
Poor boi here hasn't experienced the buy the rumor sell the news phenomenon. God speed

Ditto lol I'm not rich enough to stay liquid as long as this market has been irrational
Of course I did. I panic sold at the very very bottom after holding strong for a few days. Then I made it all back and then some on Apple and MSFT options
Actually Steam is the Amazon
Am üåàüêª v. Snowflake.  

At the minimum hoping for a pullback with the first insider expiry date coming up.
So, essentially most people are gonna pump thousands into shares premarket and then dump them as the price rockets and then there are gonna be 1000s of bagholders that weren't in on the scheme at the bottom of the drop.

The bear thesis is done. Large cap companies do just fine in this sort of environment. Retail investors who think the economy moves based upon the demand side rather than supply side are so smooth brained it hurts. The only real catalyst to the down side is if the Dems win the Georgie senate run offs in January which would give them all 3 branches of Gov. Or perhaps if COVID somehow mutates and starts killing 5% of infected people with a more normal distribution of ages not just the elderly. Other than that pls explain what the downside catalysts are.
Cashed out during the pump Friday. Will buy back in to 12/18 calls if it trades down or flat.

Still have Mexico legislation news by 15th.

My guess before the vote is while we wouldn‚Äôt see a huge pump we‚Äôd probably see higher floors. We will see if that plays out.
Now move your mouth up and down
> MOST brokerages will usually exercise your contract, or sell it. If you don't have enough capital to buy the 100 shares, they will exercise the contract and then liquidate the shares, giving you the profit between the strike price and current price. To avoid that, it is usually advisable to sell your contract before expiration.
market is jacket to its non-gendered tits
Agreed
Yes just like Uber which is at all time highs after a decade of ‚Äúwise‚Äù investors like you saying it‚Äôs over. LOL

They even survived a pandemic which is much worse for them than Airbnb which actually gained market share vs hotels

You‚Äôre clearly not familiar with venture capital investing. The whole point is to pump in billions of dollars to grow quickly and create network effects which make it extremely difficult for anyone to compete (and then you buy the best competition)

None of these companies are trying to show a profit. As they come public they start to appease the public investors but yes obviously they could have been cash flow positive for years if they wanted a slower growth rate.
Those days don‚Äôt mean shit anymore
Dalwhinnie
The right play seems to be buying shares and selling weekly covered calls to wsb at inflated premiums once this starts to pump.
I learned not to bet against the market. Too difficult to time. If you do want to, just dump a couple hundred in it. That way when you‚Äôre wrong like 5x in a row, you‚Äôll only lose $1000. Then when you‚Äôre right that one time you can maybe make the $1000 back. 

TLDR: Stonks go up

If it's true that the Pfizer vaccine can start being distributed in 2 weeks after approval from the FDA this week, we are going to green like we've never greened before.

What's the plays boys?
If you‚Äôre in margin yes that‚Äôs an option. Or move the shares to a cash account.
The price of a contract is made up of INTRINSIC value (Stock price - Strike price) + EXTRINSIC value (premium - intrinsic value). EXTRINSIC value is affected by time decay and implied volatility.  If a stock price is OUT OF THE MONEY, it will have 0 intrinsic value and only priced according to its EXTRINSIC value. Once the contract gets IN THE MONEY, then you can start factoring its INTRINSIC value.

I will use that 1,000,000 dollar TSLA option post as an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7anqp/200000\_return\_4\_presplit\_tsla\_options\_purchased/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7anqp/200000_return_4_presplit_tsla_options_purchased/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

In that post, it appears he bought 20x 136c expiring on 1/15/21 for 0.23 X 100 each. He paid 460 dollars for those contracts that were comprised of only EXTRINSIC value. As soon as the price of TSLA got above his strike price, his contracts were now worth the INTRINSIC + EXTRINSIC values.

If we calculate the INTRINSIC value of his contract, it is 598.98 -136 = 462.98 (Stock price - Strike Price). The EXTRINSIC value is 463.35 - 462.98 = 0.37, but is extremely small in comparison to his INTRINSIC value. If we calculate the total premium for the contract, it is 462.98 + 0.37 = 463.35 X 100 shares/contract = $46,335. Since he owns 20 contracts, his total equity is 46,335 X 20 = $926,700.

Essentially, he bought 20 far far OUT OF THE MONEY contracts for cheap and once the stock price hit the strike price, he started getting $2,000 for every dollar that TSLA went up. This is the power of options.
Too basic

Flu vaccine is the way it is because it's made as cheaply as possible so that we can literally give it away to anyone who wants it every year. The process for making the vaccines that are currently being produced is significantly more expensive but more reliable, and the techniques being used to design the vaccine are cutting edge and fundamentally more effective and safer than that used in a flu vaccine. Breakthroughs in the science that were just discovered and shouldn't have hit the market for another decade just due to cost of implementation have been pushed into current industry practices.

I have a chub for biosciences and watching the development of the vaccine has been pornographic for me.

A few thousand up or down a year for my first few years would be fine, just for the fun of it.
You're a special kind of retard.

These aren't as risky. I do something similar to OP, I just don't hold quite as long. I bought $35 2022 XOM calls back when the stock was ~$32 then sold them when they went in the money and bought $40 XOM calls. Just sold those this last Friday and bought $42.5 calls. All of the profits go into stocks that I sell covered calls against and I keep the same or close to the same buying power in options.
Too peaty imo

Options are an excellent way to lose your money quickly, because they retain little to no value of the stock that underlies them moves the wrong way, or not at all.

Not even close. This is a long play.
Low IV and the relative percentage gains that accompany it change depending on the ticker. Some tickers go through daily movements of 1-2% stock value while others routinely swing 5-10%. This causes the general stock option IV to be higher or lower but pretty much staying consistent so IV crush isn‚Äôt really a thing unless you‚Äôre buying short-dated options right before a publicly announced date catalyst like an earnings call. But know that IV over say 200% needs much more than a 1% stock movement in your preferred direction to see profitable gains.
CRM. That is all.

This strategy is about IV gain, not earnings in particular.  That is a different method.
If this is calls you‚Äôre talking about, 500@0.55 is $27,500. If the cost basis goes up 0.45, you make $22,500 in profit. Basically, you would make $500 for each ‚Äúcent‚Äù the options moves.

If this is shares, then yeah, you make 45 cents per shares.

Airbnb does not rely on business travelers they go after backpack travelers, families and younger travelers. Long term stays. Business travelers are a new opportunity for them. Hotels are pretty much fucked I manage hotels for a living. Business travel won‚Äôt return for a while to pre covid travel now that companies found out they can survive without it they will just save those expenses. People will be hesitant to stay at hotels so they will opt out for Airbnb. 
ABNB is a tech company where we work was a real estate company that marketed themself as a tech company. 
The demand for travel next year will be through the roof next year and hotels will charge premiums to make up money from this year tons of hotels will also be out of business
The high was in the $60s, but many more shares were in circulation at that time. If it hit the same market cap that it reached at the previous high then it would be over $100 since there are less shares now.
How we feel about tomorrow retards? Red or green ?
I think the best advice I ever got was to look at /r/wallstreetbets as entertainment but never take advice or any post seriously. You should really do the same because multiplying your money by 6 times and thinking that's pathetic is incredibly dangerous to your financial health.
Gme had its peak at 60 back in 2013, correct, but since then the available float has been but in half. This means the old price is only half what the new price would be if it happened today. So 100 is reasonable if we hit 2013 levels

>No, it hasn't. In fact, the highest GME has ever hit was $62.30, on Dec 28, 2007. 

 Back in 2007 when it hit $62.30, there were 168 million shares outstanding. Through buybacks over the years, there are now just 65 million shares outstanding. The equivalent price today would be $161

Well you just bolded random passages about Q1 and Q2 when they‚Äôve already reported Q3 results. Are you really quoting that a travel company laid off staff at the beginning of the pandemic as a bad thing? Every single company did it. Disney is largely shut down, has fired tens of thousands of workers, and is at all time highs. Even Apple took long term loans in the spring. All it did was help their margins so you should be happy.

So yes feel free to highlight that in March they weren‚Äôt sure how October and November would go just to be a jerk. We now know they went super well and a major analyst is already saying it‚Äôs worth $75+

If you buy a call from me, we agree on

- a strike price

This is that pre-set price. At any point during our temporary contract you can buy 100 shares of XYZ from me for this price. If the actual price goes above this price, you can immediately buy those 100 shares from me and sell them for immediate profit. But if it doesn't go above the price or if it goes down, you don't have to.

- an expiration day

This is when our contract ends. After this day, the contract is over. I no longer have to sell you my shares.

- a premium

This is what you pay me at the beginning to buy the call.

So when writing it out, you'll see it listed as XYZc $100 12/21

XYZ is the company, the little c means its a call, if you see a little p it means put. $100 is the strike price, and 12/21 is the expiration.
Yeah it‚Äôs weird. They‚Äôre not black and don‚Äôt rap about shooting people

50 contracts of GLD 6/18 $170c
This is the way
This is going up past $300 by the first half of next year for sure.

I have some calls right now but I was legitimately upset that BABA did not fall (it fucking rose instead!) after the House passed the China delisting bill. Was prepared to buy another round of LEAPS calls if BABA had fallen to $250 and below.

I hope Trump's signing of the anti-China bill tanks BABA's stock price so I can load up on much better prices.

I want you to think hard about what is happening to you in that infographic. You have been given faces and accomplishments however you have not been given *options*. You have no idea what applicants actually showed up nor do you have any idea if these people are actually best for the job; you only have their accomplishments (which of course are stylized to attract you, dear investor) and the implication that this team is a great team.

In reality I propose that the picture afore you may not be the reality you think it is; I don't propose that we overdiversify but I doubt that these individuals are the cream of the crop, no biases were in place in hiring, and that there wasn't some kind of inclination for presentation here. There is tons of material on this but basically again it is fine that you do not know anything about this, that's good, just stop pretending you do or understand the issues here.

You don't. 

I think this is the problem of expertise. You can tell right away when someone is flat out clueless but I don't think you think you're clueless. I think you think your points are valid because you don't know any better.

If you've read the countless serious DDs on this, you would know that there hasn't really a fair enough comparison in the history of short squeezes. Read the 3+ main DDs from the foremost WSB researchers on this, and they give out PTs. But even then, were not really sure. If we knew how to predict the future, this sub wouldn't exist and we'd all have our own hedge funds.
Also note that the squeeze, atleast from what I've read here as well, should take days to happen, due to the amount of shorts that need to cover relative to the average daily volume (see: short days to cover).
Go through the sub and search GME, and read everything you can on it. At the end of the day, no one here is responsible for your gains and/or losses, and DDs are only as useful as you make em.

They hate us cuz they anus.
I want to answer since you asked without artifice but I'm not worldly enough to speak knowledgeably. 

Instead I'll answer what my ideal (attainable) capitalist society would look like.

The means of production are privately owned with strong private property protection. Social safety nets exist but they're engineered to help you help yourself. I'd like to see job training and community college to be replaced with welfare. I'm far from smart enough to talk about health care reform but anything like Sanders' plan to outlaw private insurance is a non-starter for me. I'd like to see what Biden does with the public option. 

Unattainable capitalist goal? I love Ayn Rand and believe she's right about rational self interest and trading value for value. Unfortunately too many people read Atlas Shrugged and come away with greed instead of selfishness and cheating instead of trading value for value.

> Options are contracts that allow but don't require the buyer to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a pre-set price.

And that's where I am lost, never to be found.
Meh it doesn't need to move much
Originally it was an insurance method. If I wanted to buy 100 shares but wanted to be sure about the profit I could buy an option and only buy the 100 shares if the price goes up. There is a good chance It won't go up, and I'll lose my premium. But if it goes up, ill make a bunch of money. High risk I'll lose, but if I win, I'll win big.

To the person selling it, its great, you can make extra money by selling options against your shares.

The benefits are magnified effects of risk and reward.

The seller gets to greatly increase his chance of profit, while the buyer gets to greatly increase his potential profit.

Correct. Losses are limited to what you put in. 

Technically, gains are infinite. If Fitbit partnered with Tesla tomorrow morning and you needed a Fitbit to start your car, I would be rich as fuck. Gains are infinite. 

A similar call for Tesla would be $4,500. 

There **are** areas where your losses are infinite, but not a standard call/put on Robinhood. What you pay is your max loss, and they charge you an exact amount.

If I want XYZ stock and it's @ $110/share, I can write a CSP @ $100 for $200 premium and if XYZ drops down to $100, I then buy 100 shares @ $100 ($1000 total), but I've collected $200 in premium so my cost/share is really $80 (($1000 total - $200 premium)/100 shares).  So as long as XYZ doesn't drop below $80 (this is the risk part), you're "making money" since you could then re-sell the position at more than you paid for it.

Edit: yeah I fucked up the math; underlying concept remains solid

Low integrity = high profits
Shares, to write calls
Crude oil is $.84 per gallon. Gold is like $.60 per milligram. It‚Äôs a lot easier to deal with the gold.
It‚Äôs fine to learn about this stuff, but unless you are sitting on a large pile of cash, it‚Äôs just not worth spending that much time on advanced stock plays and trying to outsmart the market. Spend that time focused on earning money and increasing the size of your paycheck. If you want to invest, don‚Äôt over think it. Put it in broad coverage ETFs like VTI and QQQ, and leverage the massive tax benefit of maxing out a Roth IRA ($6k annual limit) and it‚Äôs a near certainty you will be better off in the long run, and highly likely in the short term as well compared to the fuckwits on this sub (all of whom I love and appreciate dearly).

Berry is an idiot, why would Elon sell his shares and tank the stock for some capital? The company is growing nicely.

It's better to let TSLA moon, other people can sell the shares/options and buy a tesla with the gains and Tesla can gain the capital that way.

You don't know what option premium "means"?

And the fact that option value will move with TSLA is why they aren't suitable for "any bank" - buying these calls is a bet on the price movement of an insanely volatile underlying in a bubble, at all time market highs, with a time limit and a depreciating premium component.

Vega is highest for at the money options because that's the price where people are most uncertain about the future price of the underlying.  Think of it this way: a far OTM option will stay OTM even if the IV changes a little bit because regardless, the option is still trash.  Similarly, a far ITM option is not about to become worthless because IV has changed.

Large ISPs have gotten government handouts... ü•≠(really Paul Ryan‚Äôs) tax cuts were essentially handouts to the top 15% of Americans... All supply side or trickle down economics is just benefits for the corporate and/or upper socio-economic classes.

If you want to be realistic, the short squeeze isn‚Äôt going to really happen. VW and every other squeeze require a lack of liquidity to pull off. 

‚ÄúWe hold 5% of shares, CHEWY boy bough 10% there is not float!!‚Äù You say, but the daily volume is still 10% of outstanding shares. So despite all the holders it still gets crazy volume. Enough volume that short sellers could exit positions by the thousands and barely affect daily volume
I think C3.AI is going to be huge after it IPO‚Äôs. Surprisingly my favorite IPO this next week
Yes they are higher risk/reward due to the leverage and expiration.

Calls = the right but not the obligation to purchase shares at a specific price on or before a specific date.

Puts = holder has the right to sell at a specific price on or before a specific date.

Buy calls when you are bullish on a company, buy puts when you are bearish on a company.

I won‚Äôt get into options strategy because I don‚Äôt know shit, but the two that a beginner should understand would be:

Covered Calls
Cash secured Puts
Tesla is also trading at over 60 times revenue. Completely fucking overvalued. Lol
Calls == a bet that the stock will go up and hit a certain price by a certain date

Puts == same but a bet it goes down

The price you pay pay for making this bet is the premium. Once you buy one, you can resell it so it can go up or down in value based on if the bet is more or less likely to happen. Obviously if it's a bet that it's goin up (a call) then if the stock goes up, it goes up in price because it is closer in price to the strike (the price you bet it would hit). Also, as the date gets closer, the value goes down, as the uncertainty and speculation is less as you get closer. 

It's called an option because this bet I speak of, is actually the option to buy or sell 100 shares at the price you choose.

If you buy a put, you'll pay the premium, that is your max loss. The chance you'll profit is probably pretty low, but if you profit you'll profit greatly.

If you sell a put, you get paid the premium, that is your max gain. The chance you'll profit is great, but if you lose, you'll lose a lot

If you want that type of play I'd consider a $20C/$30C debit spread, and then if there's a dip after & IV crush close the $30C leg. Or even use the $35s.

I have a bunch of $10 strike because with 75 delta they are the closest stock proxies. When I bought them initially I wanted to sell short term calls against them but that's pointless because PCG option premiums are peanuts. 

Recently I've moved more towards $20 1/23 options. Will also start picking up $25 strike. Because those get more upside as PCG starts going up due to gamma increases.

Which is retarded because if i am closing a debit spread, obviously i want a credit. My finger accidentally hit debit though and i ended up getting $0 for my order. I believe it was about $500 i lost. Contacted robinhood. No answer (this was in feb/march mind you).

Yeah that's the problem.
You have to have a call for said company at 12,000 strike price so if you do, you‚Äôre in the money if you bought your ticket saying it‚Äôll be 3000 then your out the money, it all matters on what you bought the contract for, it‚Äôs betting on the ticker, call go up, put go down, date of expiration matters so what are the odds of you getting to your desired ticker price by said date, if your expiration date is too close and you expect it to jump $100 probably not a good option as it‚Äôs unreasonable

The very reason I made this bet is because people like you thought it was impossible. You can only get 100:1 on your money when someone has extreme confidence in something being impossible, so thank you and others like you for extreme misplaced confidence.

Anyone sell covered calls on NIO?
Not all! I‚Äôm coming back with my $2
Okay so you can think of calls as coupons and puts as insurance.

Calls/coupons and puts/insurance have three things you gotta consider. Strike price, cost of contract (premium), and the expiration date. Each contract represents 100 shares.

Strike price price of call is the $ amount/share the call/coupon will let you buy all 100 shares at. For example, if a call has a strike price of $10, and you have 1, then regardless of what the stock price is at, you get you buy all 100 shares at $10 a pop. 

Okay so before you buy that $10 strike price call, you need to consider how much you are paying for it. If the call says $1.00, it actually costs $100, since the call represents 100 shares. For you to not lose any money (break even) in the example, the actual share price needs to reach $11 ($100 profit - $100 entry cost = no profit or loss). If it hits $12, thats $100 profit, $13 is $200 profit, etc. 

You don't actually need to have enough money to buy the 100 shares. The call/coupon itself will reflect the change in value of the stock. Robinhood sells contracts automatically 1 hour before they expire, as long as the contract is in the money. You can sell contracts anytime you want as well. Just remember that it counts as a day trade if you buy and sell the same contract the same day. You can sell and then buy the same day without it counting.

Next up is expiration date. How far away the contract expires influences how much the contract costs. Consider this.. two contracts with the same strike price but different expiration dates. A contract that expires a year from now is going to cost way more than one that expires next week. This is because the year out contract has much more time to reach the strike price and go up from there. If you weekly contract doesn't reach the strike price, then it expires worthless and you lose all the money you spent on it. 

Weekly contracts are very risky, but can net you a lot of profit, since usually they are very cheap, and if you stock jumps up suddenly, that cheap contract will then not be as cheap. This works best when you buy more than just a few weeklies. Say I buy 50 at $10 each ($500 total) and then goes up whatever amount and the contracts are worth $50 each, then I can sell them all for $2500, netting myself $2000 profit.

Puts are basically like calls except they let you sell 100 shares at the strike price. You don't have to have 100 shares of a stock the buy puts, as what you want to make your money on is the share price of the stock dropping below the strike price, so you can sell the put to someone else.

Options are extremely risky and you will lose all your money. Weeklies even more so.

Bruh why you trying to crush the man? Everyone knows buying a stock posted here makes it tank, let the man keep some dignity, fuck.
If this is a turnaround story then I'm hoping it steadily grows over time. The highest strike on 1/23 leaps is $15 and is going for about $2.25. It has a 50 delta. Which means compared to buying the stock, there's about 2x more upside. These will also be the least affected by IV crush compared to near term options. And practically 0 theta. And as BB gets closer to $15, you get gamma increases too. 

Might pick up these on Monday.

Sell it on 24. Jump back in on new year for earning
No doubt.
Sure
There are a few questions in here I‚Äôll try to answer. 

First, in my example, I referenced a ‚Äúcall option‚Äù which is the right to buy shares at a specified price on or before a specified date.

Note that you paid for the right to do this but you are not OBLIGATED to do so.

Second part, if the share price drops after you purchase the option, you simply let the option expire worthless. Meaning you lose the premium you paid and the contract terminates.

Third, the contract doesn‚Äôt go negative. It just sits at $0.00 or $0.01 until it expires.

Fourth, the short answer on who sets the premium is ‚Äúthe market.‚Äù So people will buy and sell options contracts just like individual shares of a stock and they have bid/ask spreads on them that change every day.

Fifth, to expand on premium pricing. If you want to go down a rabbit hole google ‚Äúthe Greeks‚Äù in options trading. Essentially, people set premium based on things like the timeframe the contract will be open, volatility of the underlying stock and some other considerations. 

Sixth, going back up to my initial points. Buying and selling shares only needs to happen if an options contract is exercised. 

By that I mean, in your example where you bought a call option @ $10 and the stock price goes to $2. No shares will (or I guess I should say ‚ÄúSHOULD‚Äù) change hands. If you‚Äôre the one with the option contract - why would you exercise it and buy 100 shares at $10, costing you $1,000, when you could buy 100 shares for $2 costing you $200? It doesn‚Äôt make financial sense.

So a significant amount of options expire each week without ever being exercised.
[removed]
What the actual fuk
Yes but robinhood will automatically sell it before closing that day if you don't have enough money in your account to buy the 100 shares. Otherwise it will automatically buy the 100 shares.

I agree with you 100%. MAC is 100% of my portfolio, and is the most undervalued stock on the market right now. Bought in at $9.4 with slight leverage. Their Covid-affected FFO is $2.08, apply a 10x multiple on that and your target price is $20.8. If you use 2019 FFO of $3.52, which I think we will get back to by 2022, and Multiple of 10x you‚Äôre looking at $35.2. NAV analysis at 6.2% cap rate used for Simon‚Äôs Taubman acquisition would indicate a similar valuation of $36. 

There‚Äôs no other stock on the market where you see this sort of 200% upside in such a brief period of time without assuming ridiculous growth assumptions. The only assumption here is that the REIT will trade at some point at the value of its properties - debt at private market valuations. Another point of note is that I‚Äôm also bearish on malls, but on class C and D malls. Those are shutting down left and right, which is good for class A malls. There hasn‚Äôt been a single class A mall that has shut down in the last 10 years. MAC has similar asset quality to SPG, primarily class A malls with some class B. 

The mall REITs were the best plays in 2009, with Macerich returning 700% in one year.

I'd tell you Virgin Galactic took the entire time SpaceX used to develop Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship to get one suborbital rocket flying. And currently has nothing more than powerpoint slides to show for any follow on rocket.

Show me literally any hardware for this "follow on rocket" that will need to be flying in less than four years to compete. Much less compete with a rocket nobody else can come within an order of magnitude of competing with.

Anyone who thinks Virgin has a Starship competitor is delusional.

I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôve almost ordered a call a few times and then my ignorant quivering asshole tightens and I stick with pouring money into SP500.. which has been slowly successful, but not as exciting as what I see some of you guys experience
Honestly speaking- 

Do you know the true value of the company per share based on book prices/assets? Have you run any sort of sales analysis or profit analysis?

If you‚Äôre basing the entire hope on a squeeze, it is dependent on how long the other investors hold. Because as soon as more start taking profits the squeeze ends. That could be at 20. 25. 30. 35. Etc. there‚Äôs a good basis to know when to expect it, when pricing has too far exceeded valuation. People will sell.  If book is 20, when it hits 40 do shares get dumped? What is burrys exit price? Cohen? 

Bottom line, $50+ sounds absurd based on the company prospects and is entirely squeeze dependent. How can you say with any certainty that at $40 the WSB autists plus burry and Cohen don‚Äôt all liquidate?
Isn't there a chance that they wrapped up all the years major loses due to pandemic and closures into last earnings, with the msft deal hitting this earnings and all the new consoles hitting guidance making it an epic earnings report?

It's now or never on this stock. The next administration will not be interested in releasing FNMA.

Puts are a little bit like buying insurance for your stock. It's a contract which lets you sell a stock at a certain price. You would buy put contracts if you anticipate a stock will go down.

You can also sell calls and puts, which have the opposite sentiment. You sell call contracts if you anticipate the stock to go down. You sell put contracts if you anticipate the stock to go up.

So if you predicted a stock would drop tomorrow, you'd buy a put now, and keep your selling price high, provided it actually does drop?

If you buy a $10 call option and the stock goes to $15 at the end, that means you can buy 100 shares at the $10 price (plus the $50 premium you spent to buy the contract) 

If it drops down to $2, you effectively lose your $50 premium and your contract is worthless, because you don‚Äôt want to exercise that contract. Nobody would pay $10 for a $2 stock.
I would compare to Uber and Lyft...   then decide your play

He was doing a put credit spread which involved selling a put at a higher strike price and buying another put at a lower strike price, giving him a credit. Because it was done over the weekend, the Robinhood app erroneously displayed cash balance of one side of the spread. Had he just waited until the following Monday, it would have shown him his correct balance.

Sort of a serious answer: cboe has a good education  series that goes over what each of these things are. There's also other resources out there.
Risk? In investment? Holy shit, someone call the police. But seriously man, I'm up like 4-500% my first month. Besides, shit can go tits up with shares too, just not as often. I know I've used this analogy before, but you're right, it's a casino in a way that you can't ever be completely certain that things are going to work out in your favor

I honestly do believe though that, much like a casino, you can to a degree educate yourself: Do DD, learn to do at least some level of technical analysis and learn how business works in general. If you get a good grasp on things, then you look at it like a run in poker. It's not about winning every hand; just gotta keep things above 50% winrate if you will.

I also eat very little sugar, and it has been great for my overall health. 

It has amounted to me cutting out basically all fruit.
The $50 part was the simplification and a little fuzzy math since things decay as the option moves closer to expiration, but leaving that aside I‚Äôll try to answer. 

The option pricing should leave the investor indifferent between the option and owning the shares.

So to buy 100 shares @ $10 = $1,000

If it goes up to $12/share = $1,200

That‚Äôs the total outlay. 

So for the option contract, how do you capture the $200 gain in the price? 

$200/100 shares = $2 increase per option contract. 

So if you purchased the option contract when the shares were at $12/share, your premium would be $2 plus (some varying amount based on time to expiration, volatility...etc.).

So option premium $2/share = $200

Option contract gives your right to buy @ $10.

Exercise the option and buy the shares at the strike price costs $1,000 ($10x100).

Total cost = $1,200. ($1,000 purchase plus $200 premium - for 100 shares)

Current stock price = $12

Selling 100 shares at $12/share = $1,200

So, you breakeven. It leaves the investor indifferent between owning shares or owning the option contract.

The fuzzy math part is why in real life, the breakeven price for this strategy does not exactly match up. You pay more premium for a longer dated contract, for example, and that decays over time as you move towards expiration. Volatility of the underlying stock can increase premiums if it is high volatility and decrease premiums if low volatility.

A call is cheeper than 100 shares so if you can‚Äôt afford or don‚Äôt want to own the shares you can still take advantage of them. It‚Äôs less risky than buying more than you can afford with margin because you can only lose what you pay for the call. 
If you sell options you get the money the person paid for the call as well as the strike price for your shares, so say I want to sell 100 Ford shares if they reach $11. I could sell monthly call options on those shares with a strike of $11 and get paid for selling the option every month until they sell.

I‚Äôve noticed from following this stock and the options activity for it that with the high OI on that otm strike that‚Äôs still over a month out, there‚Äôs a very good chance that it will be itm before it starts getting too close to expiration. I hope to have enough money to actually exercise if this plays out the way I want it to so I get the shares. It‚Äôll be my first option that I do that with.

Not sure why you feel the need to make two hype comments in this thread. Before you even bought it. But here is Wall street journal with a more sober take on the IPO:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-ipo-filing-shows-profitable-quarter-after-deep-cuts-11605564419

Airbnb **lost $697 million** through the first nine months of the year, **more than twice as much as it lost in the year-earlier period**, underscoring the toll of the health crisis. Revenue dropped 32% over the nine-month period.

The home-sharing platform‚Äôs ability to resuscitate to profitability and proceed with an impending public offering show how unpredictable‚Äîand yet ultimately navigable‚Äîthis year has proven for some companies

**Airbnb cautioned**, however, that a recent surge in Covid-19 infections in Europe **could damp its prospects for the fourth quarter**

**Mr. Chesky quickly pivoted to raising capital to keep the business afloat, laid off a quarter of staff and shed noncore businesses.**

Airbnb is expected to garner a valuation of roughly $30 billion in its offering. Airbnb‚Äôs valuation fell to $18 billion when it raced to secure a loan as bookings plummeted earlier this year. 

Airbnb has been under pressure to list this year because some employees lose their stock options next year. **The company said it would allow employees to sell up to 15% of their shares when it lists in December.**
Ok now that changes things
Thank you finally someone explains it in the format it‚Äôs always posted here

I appreciate that. I knew it wasn‚Äôt a great example, was mostly trying to get validation on the thought process. I‚Äôm currently testing to become a life and health insurance agent so I‚Äôve been learning about annuities and shit like that, and I felt it might be a microscopic springboard I could use to finally learn about stonks and investing. 

Options are basically just higher risk/higher bets on short term spikes, as opposed to shares that are a longer term investment, with arguably less risk and less reward? 

The only other thing I‚Äôm curious about is the absolute basics of calls vs puts. 

After that I figure I‚Äôll be able to translate this sub more easily and learn from there.

you've bought the option when it was worth $50, so if you exercise it after it becomes $250 then you're getting all the 100 shares for $1000 and can sell them for the share price of $250, OR you can directly sell the option to someone else for $250 who thinks that the option will go even higher. 

You don't buy a $250 option and exercise it there and then without any activity (up, if it's a call option). 

You let it expire if it goes down but only exercise it if it goes up.
But even on weeklies the price of a stock can shoot up 15% or more. I know it's unlikely but the premium for weeklies is so small for deep OTM options it hardly makes it worth it.

So ideally with the fractional shares, is it best to buy more volatile stocks in the gamble of actually making profit? Doesn't seem like the larger/ popular stocks move too much. Or just buy them, sit on them, and wait till they make a profit?

A put gives the buyer the option to sell someone 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. Think of it like a call going the other way. If PLTR is at $25 and I sell a put with strike $22, I'm selling someone the right to sell me shares of PLTR at $22. They are betting the stock goes down, because if PLTR hit $18 they could buy shares from the market at $18 and sell them to me at $22.

What did you buy?
I started out shorting travel when they peaked 6 months ago, that got me to 2.5k where I made a margin account, bought fcel and various other hype ev/tech. Sold them all for good profit, than I bought abunch of recovery stocks/oil and am currently riding that wave. Also abunch of other hype stocks/low cap stocks in the mix
For the love of god plz
Yeah but WSB doesn't really work that way. 

You basically chose a meme stock.  2 weeks ago it was PLTR and you buy calls .

You don't have to understand the company, you just go with the trend.

To make money, you have to do what nobody talks about on WSB, not being an autist gambler.
This is just the closest they‚Äôve been. They‚Äôre still several hundred AU apart.
Damn you
Smart
I‚Äôm here from the front page so this may be a dumb question... who sets the premium to $50? Isn‚Äôt that like buying $1000 worth of stock (100* $10) for $50?  Is it because you have to sale the stock at the end of the period? What happens if the stock goes down $2 instead? Does the premium go to -$150 instead? How does that work?
Correct. Buy the 700, sell the 750. Max profit is 5k minus cost. 

This also helps mitigate massive iv crush

Your thought process regarding how to use options effectively is correct here. Meaning, yes, one way to play them is event driven.

However, that specific example I would exercise a lot of caution on. I know it seems like this was recently announced, but I think it has been known since at least October. And if you look at the price movement for CVS over the last month, it‚Äôs up 23%, so it‚Äôs likely this is already priced in to the shares.

This is why you see others recommending LEAPS or long dated maturities on options, because it helps to offset some of the timing risk in your bet. In other words, there is time for you to be right. 

I‚Äôll try to answer any other questions you have because I know this stuff can be confusing. But I will also say that I‚Äôm nowhere near the most knowledgeable person on this sub.

Interest rates today (~0.09%) are at 1/16 of the rates in January (~1.5%) this year. In addition close to 25% of the current total dollar supply has been printed this year.

Based on this assets should be trading close to ~21x (16 x 1.33) compared to January, all other things equal. This is not the end of the bull runs. Stocks, real estate, gold w/e, BUY. Cash is trash.

This has been an extremely profitable trade for the last 10 years and gme is such a small part of the trade that most MMs don‚Äôt even notice- we have talking funds with hundreds of billions shorting a company that was worth 300 million in total. 

Also, PTs for gme are as low as $1.6. A lot of hedge funds think that the recent price action is temporary euphoria and their short position will be proven correct. That is why heads will roll when this stock pops to $500 üöÄüöÄüöÄüòé

It is entirely up to your risk profile wether or not to buy more. If you can afford the risk, I think this is a good one. IV took a good spike on Friday, so it is pretty high on these and we haven‚Äôt seen much movement in stock price. Monday is a pivotal day for the market so I‚Äôd wait and see what happens early next week to potentially scope an afternoon reentry.
Lol, you can work remotely, right? Why aren't you in Mexico or somewhere cheaper with good quality of life?
These are not the actions of a company in hyper growth (which you want for a tech IPO), but for a company in distress. Which is not really their fault because their buisness is hit by the pandemic. But you don't want to over pay for something like this. Which you certainly will on the IPO day. If you are planning to find a bigger idiot, then you can try that - but remember more often than not, you're gonna be the biggest idiot.

It was pulled from NYSE and now trades on OTC. Basically all the profits for the last ten years are just being dumped back in to the treasury every year. Insane amount of capital. They are just bleeding it dry unlawfully. Its taken time to get to SCOTUS and like always, SCOTUS forces the hands of the gov agencies/politicians.

Re your question:  "Even though Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are technically shareholder-owned, they have been under government conservatorship since the Great Recession. Many investors who hold stock in the two companies are eagerly waiting for them to emerge from government control so their stock can trade on public exchanges again."

So no. The gov has FNMA in this conservatorship limbo where they just steal the profits every year and dump into treasury. FNMA has paid back all of the original loans given out in 2010 to keep the company afloat and then some (over 10% in interest so far). SCOTUS is gunna mangle the unlawful gov practices.

This company is a juggernaut. It trades at $2.50 because its been in conservatorship so long and people have now just wrote it off (lots of hype in 2016 with no changes). Lots of material changes since then, most notably, finally going to SCOTUS. It's a situation where the boy cried wolf, but the wolf is at the door now (SCOTUS). Time to get in for tendies, folks.

Shouldn't the adjustment on the premium be less than the gain in the share price? Otherwise, there wouldn't be any incentive in buying options.

Going back to your example, let's say I buy your option for $250 and exercise it. I will then be having 100 shares of that stock which I acquired for $10 each. So the total money spent including the option premium is $1250.

How is that better than just buying those 100 shares directly?

Instead of buying stocks, sell to open puts.  Also, sell to open calls on stocks that you already have.  Basically get paid to buy shares that you already want at a price & date you set and get paid extra to sell shares you already have & wouldn't mind selling for the right price.

Essentially, if a stock runs up, the market is pricing in a pullback or a correction in the long term, but maybe not in the next 2 days. 

This means if a stock runs up the increase can be more than the increase in your leap, so you are negative on the trade. 

This does not happen with shares since you just get the calls assigned.

Its best if you have the risk tolerance. Just take a look at some of the losses around here and understand the really might be you. Without a well thought out plan, and research, you're basically just gambling.

If you have no trading experience its better to start with stocks. On robinhood you can get on the waiting list for fractional shares. You can buy parts of shares. Get into multiple companies, diversify, and experiment.

You can also make a paper trading account on TD Ameritrade so you can experiment with options without risking real money

I dunno, as someone who is a stronger-willed version of likely the same personality type as he had, his life didn't seem to be problematic anytime prior to this year. Just an eccentric guy with money and was doing things that made him happy. 

The reason he was cutting people out of his life is because they don't understand the fact that it isn't a problem. What appeared to be problematic to outsiders was not at all. But losing social interaction and freedom takes a big toll on these personality types, because it disintegrates their entire in-person social network.

It's not a good investment compared to the market when you factor all in costs and the upfront of a 20% down payment. I'm not saying it's a bad investment, but it's not a good pure investment vehicle if you aren't enjoying the housing and safety net benefits associated.

Ah yes I see where I‚Äôve been going wrong
I keep coming across stocks like LAZRW and KXINW, same company description in the information on the stock, but the name always has Wt. at the end.

I presume these are "weighted" stocks? They always cost less than the real stock, but they also always move further in the same direction as the real stock is moving. I.E. LAZRW was up 64% Friday, LAZR was up 36%.

No options, but if the swings in price are going to be almost twice what the original stock swings, who cares right?

What am I missing about these stocks?
Thanks! Appreciate the feedback

 **The Supreme Court will take up one of the cases involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac starting on Dec. 9. Tim Pagliara of CapWealth Advisors questions what Mnuchin will do, given the fact that the case involving the government-sponsored enterprises has gone all the way to the Supreme Court. He said that from talking to legal scholars and attorneys who are involved in the case, it seems clear that the government is going to lose.**

**"They're going to lose on the issue of whether or not you can create a loan for a troubled company in a statutory conservatorship that they can never repay and violate the basic principles of conserve and protect, which is what their mandate was under the statute," Pagliara told ValueWalk in an interview.**

**Pagliara added that the Supreme Court essentially "mocked \[Andrew\] Cuomo over the inconsistent application of steps for public safety." He said five justices on the Supreme Court are very no nonsense, and he expects them to point out how absurd the situation involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is.**

**"They're going to finally say the same things we've all been thinking since 2012," Pagliara said. "That it's absurd; you can't create a statutory remedy like the third amendment sweep that perpetually keeps companies in** [**conservatorship**](https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/11/fannie-mae-bull-case/)**."**

**Pagliara believes Mnuchin will declare that the senior preferred shares are paid, which he said is the right thing to do. He also believes that if Mnuchin doesn't do that, the Supreme Court will.**

Chinese..chicken and broccoli my boi
Bro is that bee gonna pop up already /(
The price of the contract is always listed as the premium of one share. But since a contract is always for 100 shares, you multiply it by 100. So, for instance, if you open an option chain on Robinhood and see a price of 1.00, the actual amount to purchase it would be 100 dollars for that contract. If you see 0.01, then the price to purchase that contract is actually 1 dollar.

Best way to get over one is to get under another.  Same theory works for stonks.
I know it's a meme, but in case it's helpful, here's my oversimplification: it's gambling. You can bet on a stock (call), but you can also bet against a stock (put).

You choose a date and price that you want to gamble on. If your price starts to look more likely as your date approaches, you can sell out to take some profit and run. If your price starts to look less likely as your date approaches, you can sell out to cut your losses and run.

I‚Äôve been investing for over 20 years and would love to help.

Calls - these are what you avoid after you‚Äôve invested a lot of money in just one stock and then that stock tanks and now you‚Äôve got no money.

Puts - is what you do with money you earn from your third job that you work after losing all your money from the tanked stock; you puts it aside to invest again.

Options - are what your ex-spouse gives you before you already invested your Puts into that same stock that tanked.

Glad to help, gotta go now because I think the library staff notice my smell.


‚Äî This message has been sent from my tin can.
Yes, contracts can be traded just like stocks can. The reason you see such huge gains and losses are because they are highly leveraged since each contract controls 100 shares. Take for example that million dollar Tesla option guy. He bought those contracts for super cheap, probably because they were so far out of the money last year. But as you know, Tesla has been on a massive growth streak and his OTM contracts that he got for super cheap are now deep in the money. If I recall, he owns 20 contracts which gives him control of 2000 shares. Basically, every dollar that Tesla goes over his strike of 136, he makes 2000 dollars. Since his contract is close to expiration, his contract is almost purely intrinsic value (stock price - strike price). So if we took the current price of Tesla at 599 and subtract his strike price, we get 599 - 136 = 463 X 2000 shares = 926,000. That is the power of options.

I‚Äôm holding shares in NIO after making a killing on calls. Converted a call to 100 shares. Cost $700. Otherwise I‚Äôm not in EV or batteries either. Weekly calls for SUMO SNOW. Looking at C3 AIRBNB Affirm IPOs. Good luck bro hope you hit a couple 5 baggers this week üëç
Every single time NIO has dropped under $40, the RSI switches to oversold, and it quickly recovers, within minutes. Without some kind of wonky negative news,  I see this as the floor.    Anyone buying puts after the last week is in for a really bad time.  

I believe this delisting bs will start to fade away, as people realize the US is not going to remove 8% of the market.   We might weed out a couple shady chongs,  but companies like Baba and NIO are not going to be delisted. 

As soon as they release their firm plans on the move to Europe in 2Q 2021,   I'm sure we will be seeing some more parabolic action. 

To answer your question about NIO day, any press for any company normally invites new potential investors to look into the company.    NIO day will put a positive touch to the shares. 

Currently holding just over 5k shares, and a huge amount of 4/21, 5/21, and 6/21 C

You can't even get the ticker right retardo
If I have 100 shares I can sell you a call if I dont think I the stock price will go up enough for the call to make money.

I get to keep the premium no matter what. But if the stock price soars, I lose potential profit.

Because I had 100 shares, and agreed to let you buy them for $100/share. If you do that, while the market value is $110, I lose out on that $10/share profit.

But if the stock price is under $100 share, I get to keep my 100 shares, and the premium you payed me.

Its also important to note, you can still make money by selling your call to someone else, you don't need to buy my 100 shares to make money. Because that would cost $10K. Selling the call to someone else usually is worth the same as the profit you'd make buying and then immediately selling the shares.

ELI5; iron condors can be used for a lot of strats, but what I use them for is when a stock has high implied volatility and I think it will stay in a range.

So GME before earnings has high implied volatility, and I think it will stay above 14, and under 18$ for earnings for example. so I capitalize on the IV crush that will fuck over anyone with regular calls

No I sold the right to buy TSLA for 600, whoever I sold that contract to decided to exercise their right to buy 100 shares of TSLA from me for 600 when TSLA closed at around 598.50. So effectively bought at above market price outside of trading hours. The only reason someone would do this if they thought TSLA was gonna gap up on monday, if it does then I'll be short 100 shares aka fucked in the ass.

HF is actually a piece of dog shit of a company but there‚Äôs some major buzz about the IPO among the ‚Äúweed funds‚Äù...   all the big ones are coming in.  I‚Äôm jumping in for the hype and I‚Äôll dump this thing the minute it hits my target.  I‚Äôm in the industry and this company is in bad shape so definitely not even thinking about long term hold...  I expect they‚Äôll do a secondary or follow on offering very shortly to raise much needed capital...  that could go either way, grow gen did it and blew the fuck up because they used the money right...  but generally dilution in a struggling company is different than dilution in a company with heavy positive momentum.

Premium will never be 0 dollars. The least the premium can be is 0.01 x 100 shares = 1 dollar. If you go look at options that are far far out of the money, they can be 0.01. This is how some people get huge gains, by buying 100‚Äôs of contracts that are far far out of the money and then some miraculous news hits and the stock shoots up beyond their strike price. The chances of this happening are low and more akin to purchasing a lotto ticket.

One minor correction: an ITM contract isn't, by itself, profitable. ITM is when the contract will have value at expiry, but that value may still be less that what you paid for it.

To profit at expiry, the underlying must be above breakeven, which is strikePrice+premium.

So the key here is to manage your contract. It is always advisable to sell your contract before expiration. If you do, however, let it expire, what happens to it depends on the brokerage. Most brokerages will exercise your contract so you would end up with 100 shares (or however many based on how many contracts you have). If you do not have enough buying power, most brokerages will either sell the contract for you or buy the corresponding number of shares and then liquidate it.

Maximbrutii did a good job explaining what an option is and I'll give the dumbed down version.

Options are insurance, it gives you the ability to buy into a stock and minimizing your risk.

The price goes up, you can make a lot of money, in theory, infinite money. Price goes down, you lose your premium you paid for the insurance.
I have some good position I've been looking at for Monday but don't want to share till I get in. Anyone else like that?

Exactly. Your total loss can only be $100, but your much more likely to lose the whole $100.

If I put $100 into SPY (This a safe investment) with fractional shares (buying part of a share, only some brokers let you do this), I *could* lose it all but that most likley won't happen. Chances are in the short term I'll only make or lose a little bit of money. Low risk, low reward, but safe.

Options let you take a more dangerous high risk, high reward chance.

Well... It's coming from the value of the underlying stock. This is where naked vs covered options come into play.

If the seller of a call option already owns enough shares to cover his ass if all the contacts he sold go tits up, then this is a "covered call", and the seller _may_ also profit, albeit less than if he'd sold the stock at market value, if the strike price is higher than his cost basis.

Conversely, if the seller of the call option does _not_ already own the shares, then they must buy them at market value and sell them at the strike price. Thus puts his cost basis at market minus premium (how much he sold the contracts for), and the difference is now his loss.

(For puts, the cover is the cash needed to buy they shares at the agreed price, and is called a "cash secured put".)

So... The money value of a bought call is marketPrice - strikePrice + timeValue. As you approach expiry, timeValue goes to 0.

Question though... how the fuck were those premiums so low? If I wanted to do this with Tesla today, I would need to shell out like 10k for 1 contract.
Your forgot another two zeroes.
100 million vehicles a year market by 2030.  Tesla captures 20%.  That's 20 million cars.  Tesla will grow 40-50% a year compounded this decade.

Current market cap is saying Tesla will sell about 3 million cars in 2025.  I think Tesla will sell close to 5 million cars in 2025.

Tesla is shooting for 20 million cars a year by 2030.  If so, Tesla won't be trillion dollar company.  It will have 2+ trillion market cap.  Like I said, FSD alone is worth over trillion by itself.  Seriously, you know very little about bull case on Tesla.  You should be open minded and do simple math calculation on Bull case numbers.  But really I don't give a crap what you think about Tesla.  I already won.
Didn't europeans inject 1T+ of Euro at this point? It's less than in the US but it's still a lot. That would explain why EUR/USD pair didn't change by  27%.

He's telling the 100% truth. Shares in a contract 100% or more OTM expiring in one year is typically worth 0.08 - 0.30 cents. Have a look at any options chain yourself, then max the range x4 the strike and you have your biblical million dollar bet. The IV doesn't matter in those case, could be 10 or 100, you'll still yield the same returns.

If I recall correctly from the options volume at the time, hundreds of people placed bets like the OP at the same time, I could assume 50-60% of them left when they reached target, he's just the only one to not have a target and also go public with the gains. I wouldn't be surprised if some cashed out 20mill+, you'll never know them.

Gibson is pure swag... lets say you pay 1000 for a gibson... 700 is for pure brand swag and 300 guitar. They look cool and awesome... All the cool boys ever played it. So if money is not an issue go for Gibson.   
But ESPs are good guitar. you can get same quality for half the price of a gibson. like a 1000 dollar gibson is a low end gibson. but 1000 dollar ESPs are probably some of the best ESPs...

I feel your pain- after About a minute of any stock market video I get so incensed that these BS games are how money is generated in our economy that I find it hard to concentrate.

Stocks are not ‚Äúinvest in a company and as that companies value increases you share in the profit‚Äù as we were told as children.

No, If you're buying calls or puts you can only lose the money it costed to buy the contract.  Selling options can cause you to go in the negative.
I just look at their chart. I did 1 year for all. Even YTD's look shitty. Flip your phone right side up. I should note I was just saying they are all down. I'm not fucking with any of 'em... anymore.
Literally so stupid. The closest we got to a liquidity crisis was March. Fed and treasury came in and backstopped literally EVERYTHING. Debt markets stabilized in a matter of weeks and now here we are at all time highs while you‚Äôre spewing idiocy about an incoming crisis.

I bought a put option for like $30 on Hertz because I learn by doing and $30 was an amount I was ok with losing. Well we‚Äôre approaching the end date and I‚Äôm nowhere near learning what they are or how they work. Best I‚Äôve been able to gather it‚Äôs like a dumb short sale.
Well it seems like you don't, because you can actually reduce the risk of a portfolio consisting of 100% stocks when you use the correct additions.
The premium is just money.  If you sell a contract it goes into your cash stash. If you buy, it goes to the option seller.  The option itself has intrinsic and extrinsic value.  Extrinsic value (time value) is comprised of hopes and dreams. It slowly evaporates (theta) up to expiration date.  Intrinsic value is comprised of cold hard dollars.  Neither value is written in stone, they fluctuate with time remaining and underlying stock price.
Just sell your winners when you collect half of your premium. And don‚Äôt manage losers. It‚Äôs really that simple sped...

What happens if it goes down? Can you lose more money than you have in your account and actually owe money?
That's The IPO price, not the price it will begin trading at. IPO shares are organized through a bank and are only available to select organizations and individuals. All of this happens before the company is publicly traded.

I'm having trouble understanding the purpose. Maybe I need more info on real world examples of how much a contract like this would go for. 

If the stock price is currently under $20, why not just buy 100 shares instead of the contract? If the stock price is already over $20 why sell a contract instead of just selling off shares?
Two different styles of music with those brands - what are you trying to play?

At expiry, are you then obligated to purchase the shares at whatever the strike price is? So it wouldn't just be that you'd lost whatever money you paid for it, right? You'd lose much more than that, although you'd also gain the stocks.

don't buy GME for the short squeeze. It's just a bonus on top of it being fundamentally undervalued. If high short interest was all that mattered then you'd just buy garbage like AMC and hope they squeeze one more time before they go literally bankrupt

The point with GME is the large discrepancy between short sellers betting on bankruptcy vs the real situation. It's like all these institutional short sellers were ripped off by Gamestop's trade-in offers in the past and now they hate Gamestop irrationally

He can also sell the contract right? Like let‚Äôs say he bought a contract to buy 100 shares at 1 dollar strike price but he doesn‚Äôt even have the 100 dollars available on cash to purchase the shares. He can then sell the contract for (hopefully) a higher premium than he bought it for right? As opposed to exercising the option and getting the shares.

> The program needs to exist Becusse the sad fact remains, America has a huge retirement savings problem. People don‚Äôt do it and therefore need that hand held by the government to do it for them.
However, those who are smart enough to plan,budget, save, live within ones means. Could take that money as invest it themselves and have a shit ton more than what ssa pays out

None of this is good for the markets. If retarded consumer debt taken on to impress people you don't care about on Instagram were to disappear, and everyone lived within their means, stonks wouldnt go up.... and "smart" people like us who are investing for retirement wouldnt profit as much

You open your book and settle into a long, quiet evening of reading. The bookmark the library gave you indicates you left off on page 367. Stephen Bull's *Trench: A History of Trench Warfare on the Western Front* has been less detailed than you'd like, focusing on amusingly emotional first hand accounts of soldiers, but you slog through it in hopes of discovering nuggets of strategy. You find World War 1 history pertinent to your efforts because it was the ultimate war of attrition. And because it predated ethical considerations now inhibiting modern warfare.

You scratch the new growth under your chin, and then your hand instinctually reaches for the itchy tag of your shirt. You stop yourself from tugging at it. The thrift store allows you to return clothing if you do so within a month, and this is how you have avoided doing laundry for 3 years now. Laundry detergent is a totally unnecessary expense.

An unexpected knock at the door makes you flinch and elbow your tea off of the end table, directly onto a stack of library books. You scream in horror as you inspect the damage. The coloring to the pages will be light, since you were using that tea bag for the fifth time, but the library will likely fine you nonetheless. "What, Mother!?" you bark at the knocker, knowing it is her because she is the only person who ever knocks.

She opens the door slowly and softly asks down the basement steps: "I wondered if you'd like to have dinner with me and Jim?"

"No!" you moan as you lay out the books, open, in hopes that they will dry. "I would not like to have dinner with you or *Jim*!" You spit the man's name with as much bile as you can conjure. Your mother has been much more nosy since Jim appeared, either because he explicitly instructs her to inquire about your health or, more likely, because his presence has awoken some dormant, dead, and forgotten hormonal part of her that cares for others.

As she closes the door, you assess the scene. The fines will be steep. $40. Maybe $50. This will undo months of work. And you had been so careful.

You sigh as you settle further into the trench of selling calls.

AT&T has got some internal issues
Not necessarily, there were a couple of things that made the retail sector special. One is they they took a massive hit in comparison to other sectors because of the bankruptcy narrative painted by Wall Street, but unlike other sectors (movies,cruise lines,travel) retail was actually still able to generate revenue through online the whole time. So they were limping, but not all the way knocked out. Nordstrom posted a surprise profit and that‚Äôs what ultimately let to the run up.

Question: what's the difference in what that guy did who put like 14$ in TSLA and made out with 14k versus me just putting in 50$ in stockpile app, if the performance of the stock goes wild again would I reach the same results or no because I didn't do some fancy calls etc etc like im wondering is there must be a multiplier when you guess right on these options versus just betting some money and buy a fraction of a share. Besides I think in stockpile you can't do any fancy betting, just invest a certain amount of money into a company and that's it.
Wow, you are really reaching and creating straw-man arguments. I provided actual, public quotes from officials while you provide baseless accusations and ZERO evidence. Sounds like you are the conspiracy zealot. 

‚ÄúEconomists thinking they can toy with the structure of the global economic system‚Äù 

Ok, this is by far the dumbest thing you have said yet (which is saying a lot). The world banks are LITERALLY developing central bank digital currency. China already began rolling it out. The head of the IMF and bank of international settlements are calling it ‚ÄúBretton Woods 2.0‚Äù. Jerome Powell himself has talked about CBDC over and over again. This isn‚Äôt conspiracy shit, this is common knowledge.
My portfolio is the exact same thing as my partner's shrimp tank, but the shrimp turn money into joy.
Strike is the price of the stock. 

Calls mean up. 

Puts mean down. 

You don‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt) hold an option until expiration. Sell if if it‚Äôs worth something before the date, even $1, let it expire if it isn‚Äôt. Preferably you sell it when it‚Äôs worth something more than you bought it. 

Morons on the sub buy cheap way out of the money calls hoping they‚Äôll get in the money and become expensive so they can sell them. 

You could also not be retarded and sell options. Let‚Äôs say you plan to buy 100 shares of ford but 9.29 is too high. You can sell a $9 put which would require you to buy 100 shares at $9 if it‚Äôs 9 or below at expiration. 

The above would give you the price you sold it for (let‚Äôs say, 10 bucks) and you wouldn‚Äôt have to do anything unless it went to 9 or less. You can sell that same $9 put, putting up $900 collateral, every week if you want. You‚Äôd either eventually buy 100 shares at $900 or make a ton of free money. When you do get assigned, and buy the shares, you have all that sold option money to take off the price of the shares. Let‚Äôs say you did it 3 times. $30 total. You‚Äôd have to pay 900-30 which means you essentially bought 100 shares at 8.70. Instant profit if it was anywhere over 8.71-9

Oh I‚Äôm not about to try things like this, no worries.  Honestly just curious.  How can you lose life savings with call options?  I was under the impression you can just choose not to exercise the option and only lose the upfront cost.

Close, you're paying $100 for $10,000. But you don't own the stocks. You have some level of control over them, but you don't get voting rights or dividends with them.

An option is a contract. This contract lets you at any point say you wanna buy those 100 shares. But you get to buy it for $100 a share. No matter how much more it costs.
It is unfortunate people are actually needing to depend on a stimmy. There is no one on either side in this government that cares about passing a stimmy. Best bet is prob to assume its not coming and try to figure a way to get by without.

So this bb is the new play.. Too late to get in at open?
one thing that i think im always confused is that, how much does someone has to pay when he is going to buy the call? is he going to pay only the premium, or is he going to pay the premium + the strike price X 100 shares?
Yeah the guys making contracts are
There is always a CP to every trade, even if it is a market maker. If that dude is holding those strikes that means someone somewhere has those on their books waiting to either buy them back or get assigned. They can either sell a fraction of the contracts to get the money to exercise the others, or they can find buyers who are looking to do the same.

My personal advice is accept ANY money you play with as a loss. 

New or old, always expect your next play to wipe you. You'll be less surprised when you do, and you'll play smarter because you'll always remember the risk.
Anyone with 100 shares can write a call option. You can also write put option using money as collateral. Check out r/Thetagang if you‚Äôre interested in writing options.

You sincerely believe, that in a capitalistic society where maximizing shareholder wealth is the primary goal for big publicly traded healthcare, that they would seek to lower prices to the "consumer"... out of the goodness of their heart? What?

If insurance companies were to magically disappear, healthcare companies wouldn't fight tooth and nail to find a way to keep and increase their margins?

[deleted]
The options are tied to the underlying price of the stock, but the premium paid adjusts/fluctuates to essentially remove the arbitrage.

So 1 option = 100 shares.

Premium is $0.50 = $50 for that option.

Let‚Äôs say the strike price is $10. And make it a call option.

Stock price goes to $12. 

If you owned the stock, you make a 20% return. For the option, the premium adjusts not the stock price.

So if you were going to buy the same option after it moved to $12, it should exactly offset the $2/share gain.

In 100 shares that equals $200 gain. 

So that call option premium went from $50 to $250 (simplifying a few things to show the move).

So then, our 1 option, consisting of 100 underlying shares, now costs $2.50.

So while the stock went up 20%, the option has increased in value by 5x.

The reason being leverage, since one option contract is priced on an underlying 100 shares.

No, you lose if it‚Äôs below 20 at the expiration, which, in his case, is on 1/15/21. So say it dips to 19 dollars a week before expiration, his contract is OTM and is only worth the extrinsic value but as soon as it crosses above 20 again, it‚Äôll be worth intrinsic and extrinsic value. If it remains above 20 at expiration, then it will be worth whatever intrinsic value (difference between strike and current price) is left. It will no longer have any extrinsic value.
Not robinhood tho
Good point. Hopefully there is some sort of official statement at some point.

I get that and I get what you're saying. But I thinknwe can agree our elected officials are useless. Imo if the government shuts down with no direct stimulus before Christmas the movie purge will be based on true events. Shits going to get real dark real quick. Hard working people got fucked over the first time because our elected officials are more retarded than the wsb collective. I've heard a few stories how single mothers or struggling mothers who have cash paying jobs didn't get the first stimulus after the government told their employers to shut down or get fucked. Next weekend if the government shuts down its going to be a dark few months for America.

They posted negative EV news on Friday. 15% of Cadillac dealerships will close rather than sell EVs. GM is spending all of its profit for the next 5 years to compete with Tesla. They‚Äôve failed every step of the way so far. Every time they make a big EV announcement, 6-9 months later they‚Äôre retracting it, revising the cost, or retiring an EV. Where‚Äôs the Bolt? Do they have a software company to update their future EVs like Tesla and Nio?  I hope you‚Äôre right and an old giant US company can survive but I highly doubt it long term. But good luck bro.

I will never forgive you for misspelling "Grogu" and I hope you understand you will never deserve forgiveness.
A covered call would be when you buy 100 shares of a stock, and then sell a call on those 100 shares. It's "covered" because you have those 100 shares already purchased.

Let's say you buy Tesla at 500. 100 shares for 50,000. You then sell a call for a strike of 600 for $2,000 premium. Let's say tsla moons to 650 and your call gets exercised. You don't have a net loss, since you owned 100 shares @500 you gained the difference of the strike of the call and your stock buy in price plus premium. 

So you make 600-500 = 100 x 100shares = 10,000 + 2,000 (premium collected) 

$12000 total gain even though your covered call was exercised. 

You do miss out on gains though. If you didn't sell the covered call you would of had $15000 from the shares. But you sell a covered call to hedge your risk. So if TSLA went to 480 instead. You would of broke even since you got 2000 from selling the covered call.

Me too please
It‚Äôs just a promise to buy or sell a stock at a certain price.

If you buy a $100 call and the stock moves to $125 you can either buy 100 shares at $100 or sell the contract to somebody else (it‚Äôs worth at least $2500
You answered your own question.

And there simply aren‚Äôt enough shares in existence for the shorts to escape. It‚Äôs a long slow death or a quick one. They‚Äôve opted for the former.
No, only if it's less than 20 at expiration. You do slowly lose money over the length of the contract though.

GME 1/15/21 20c
I got in at $10.80, then sold at $13.30 for a reason I can't even remember. I can rationalize buying back in at $12
So you are saying market cap should not be factored in when making an investment? $600,000,000,000 for a company that would take 700 to 800 years to make 600 billion is not overvalued?

I mean it isn't if you are living in a la la land (which is what tsla investors have been doing for years)....Saying, "well, well, well, in 5 or 10 years they'll finally hit 1 billion or 2 billion in profit".

Compare Tesla to other highly valued companies:

Google: Valued at $1.24 trillion earns $40 billion a year. Money back in 30 years.

Microsoft: $1.62 trillion earns $55 billion a year money back in 29 years.

Apple: $2.08 trillion earns $52 billion a year money back in 40 years.

Yes, I know, we are freezing most recent year when reality is in 15-30 years those companies will be making $100 billion a year. 

Tesla, valued at $568 billion made:
Q3 2020: $369 million
Q2 2020: $129 million
Q1 2020: $68 million
Q4 2019: $87 million. 

$653 million last 12 months. It would take 870 years to make your money back. They were founded almost 20 years ago and have lost money every year. Finally, in 2020 they are set to have their first profitable year since inception. 

They are nothing like a Google, Apple, or Microsoft and should not be valued as such.

If you don't have the capital to buy the 100 shares at expiration you need to sell the contract beforehand though right ? I guess a better question is what happens if you're in the money at expiration but don't have the capital for 100 shares?
Agreed 100%. Globally we're talking hundreds of billions of dollars annually in the tobacco market. And much of the world only smokes cigarettes compared to the high vape usage in the US and a few other countries.
That gambling is more important than your family.
Someone will buy so that they can exercise the option, or because they expect the price to increase further & then they can resell.

That was great.  The thing that I‚Äôm trying to figure out is how to calculate how much you are up or down?  For that 1/15/21 call.  If the price is 25 today, then how much money are you up?  If it goes to 30, how much are you up then? Is there a formula for this?  Is the number of days from the expiration date a variable?  I see people posting positions, but makes no sense how it got from $500 to several hundred thousand.

Boo. Su Bae also sold her shares at 14usd ea.
There are 68 million vehicles projected to be sold worldwide in the next year. You legitimately expect that Tesla is going to command about 30% of the entire global vehicle sales market? Over what time period do you expect that growth? 

The basic issue that the company faces is that cars are a latent industry. The number of vehicles required globally is itself not growing exponentially. There is basically a fixed number of cars everyone in the world needs, so the total addressable market is pretty well known. What you are suggesting is that Tesla is going to completely supplant the entire automotive industry and will become the biggest player by far within, let's say, the next decade? Not only that, the share price has ballooned to basically capture all of that growth already. 

For the sake of argument, let's say you're right and Tesla becomes a trillion dollar revenue company? That is twice the revenue of Wal-Mart. That means their current market cap has essentially priced in the overwhelming majority of their growth. There is less than 100% left to get to a $1T market cap. Do you think they will get a 10x revenue multiple once they have captured 30% of the entire global auto industry, despite the fact that at that point, they could only triple in size?

Fuck you. You now have to buy more. Your new position will be 2345
You have to own at least 100 shares of a stock (say SPY) and you can sell covered calls on that stock based on your selected strike price. You gain the premium paid by the call purchaser no matter what. So the upside is you always get paid the contract premium. Only drawback is if SPY shoots up 20% and you agreed to sell once it hit +5%, then you just missed out on 15% gains - option premium.
What makes you so sure it will moon?
New to stocks so forgive my ignorance.

So you're paying 1$ for 100$ worth of stock?

OP are you me?  

I started doing Robinhood towards the beginning of this year when there was the "loss post" and this guy in the comments felt bad for the OP said he could turn his $30 into $140,000 in about 1 year. So I said what the hell...ill just drop $30 into PINS like the commenter suggest to be the first step from $30 to $140,000...

Now the guy seems to have ghosted reddit about his journey from $30 to $140,000....and his "guide" on how to make it there. 

So now I'm sitting on 1 share of PINS at $67 atm not sure if that is the correct thing to be doing now lol.

/u/s1lkworm where you at bro??? I need some  guidance on how to turn this $67 into $140,000!!! I hope you didn't get covid-19 and die or some shit.

> So basically this is all out of the leftist playbook. Use leftist tactics to fuck something up badly, then propose government as the solution

Lmao the right's tactics is to defund and gut social programs than exclaim how it doesnt work (then give massive subsidies to industry which because it isnt going to natural persons is still capitalism somehow)
That is a fascinating subject and one i could talk about for days. So many different avenues to approach it from. The publicly funded industrial military complex certainly exists but even still I would argue that is far better than a privatized military.
Cool story Hansel.
Smdh.
If you have Robinhood, it‚Äôs just selling the option instead of buying it. You need to have the stock held as collateral (you can‚Äôt sell it before the expiration date), or, if you‚Äôre selling a put, you have to have enough money to buy the stock at the price held as collateral.

The premium sold goes into your buying power and your accounts net value will be less the price of the option. If you have a hundred shares of XYZ and sold a call at a premium of $1 per share, my buying power goes up $100 and my net value goes down $100. If the option‚Äôs price goes down, to say $50, you could buy it back and hey you‚Äôve profited $50. 

The only way that would happen though is if the stock didn‚Äôt go up (impossible, heresy) or if it isn‚Äôt likely to üöÄ moon üöÄ before the expiration date. If you don‚Äôt buy back the option before the expiration date you could get assigned (made to sell the stock) - you need to be careful of this around dividend payment time because folks will exercise their option to get more shares so they can get more dividend payments. If the difference in strike price and the dividend payment is positive, then it makes sense for them to get the stocks now. 

If you get assigned then you also get paid the strike price as well. Let‚Äôs say you bought $XYZ at $50. So if you sold a $1 call expiring 4/1 a strike price of $100, then on 4/1 XYZ is at $150... well hey you still came out ahead, just not as much as you could have. You made $100 selling the call, and $5k profit selling the stock at $100. You could have made $10k if you were able to sell at $150... but that extra $5k goes to the WSB chad who bought your call.

I‚Äôm such a stupid pussy for not buying PLTR calls Friday. Just holding onto my puts that I sold to üåàüêª. But PLTR will moon and IV gonna be high which will suck for buying calls

Edit: wow you guys are like the seagulls from finding Nemo, I‚Äôll just say it here I guess. Instead of dm‚Äôing every kid on the short bus.

PLTR fell 15% in a week. On Friday, it found support at 23.90. I‚Äôm not a TA guy, but I do care about investor psychology. What does support mean? It means investors can‚Äôt agree. It fell below, was bought back. It rises above, it was sold off. No one can agree, it‚Äôs stuck at 23.90. What can break this level? A big move that is amplified by retail. If big boys come in and buy huge blocks, it‚Äôll cause a noticeable pump which will signal retail to BUY, but the opposite it also true. We just had a 15% correction. There is no upcoming news that could be bad for PLTR. Is it more likely big boys but the dip or sell their shares?

Learning that options trading doesn't mean you're actually buying stocks at these prices and instead buying the contracts to buy/sell at these prices really opened my eyes as to how people are able to make money doing this. It also highlights to me how easy it would be to gamble away everything with the price of entry being so low compared to the payouts. This is fascinating.

In my state corona is getting pretty bad. If we lockdown again we‚Äôre so fucked. Plenty of people I know are struggling financially and that would be the finishing move for sure. The only difference is who is actually to blame? Sure it sucks that people only got one check and then left in the cold being stringed along. But let‚Äôs be honest there are in fact jobs out there to apply to that can keep u afloat. May not be a job u want but it can get you by. The ones who complain the most to me about being broke are the ones who don‚Äôt do shit to fix the situation. I got off my ass and applied at plenty of jobs to get me by this year and they were awful but it was temporary. I researched the market and found ways to keep myself afloat through trades. Not hitting 10 baggers but inflation isn‚Äôt bending me over either. Just my two cents on the situation

Welcome. First step is to turn your account red like the majority of us.
/u/Jesus_Shaves_ this is a perfect explanation. Read it. Clear, concise, and to the point.

If you feel a stock will go up or down based on some information you have found, go to Robinhood and mess around with the calls, puts, different costs at different expiration dates. Then, it will hit you just like it did with me. It will all make sense. 

I recently paid (BET) $3 that Fitbit would hit $9 by sometime next year. I will make ~$200 if it is $10-$11. 

If you get into one of the meme stocks on here and it's blowing up, buy a call. All the autists here will literally put you in the money.

I 100% agree. The fact that close to 30% of workers eligible for a 401k match opt out. Proves that point.
This might be dumb but how exactly do options pay like that? Is it the lender basically offers the option because if you‚Äôre wrong you lose way more money that goes to them? And presumably people are often wrong so they don‚Äôt mind paying for those larger odds if you‚Äôre right?

This is the way.
The opposite of this.
No the assumption is that it goes from $100 to $110.

You're paying $1 per share to get the option. But that price could be anything.

The stock price is still $100.

This is the most informed I've ever been reading something on here.
Shit happens. I once had my car repossessed, and had to go to my father-in-law, hat in hand, and asked for $20,000 to pay it off. One of the worst experiences in my life. 

But you know what? He loaned me the money, basically took out a second mortgage to do so, and only made me pay pack what I could afford every month. It took me a few years, but I‚Äôll be damned if I didn‚Äôt work my ass off to pay him back in full with interest. 

And now I‚Äôm in a position where I can help my kids when they get older and get into a similar situation. Parents should be there to help their kids. I want them to come to me when they need help, just like my FIL helped me. 

It sucks, and feels terrible in the moment, but I guarantee you that he‚Äôs glad you came to him instead of someone else. Just work your hardest and eventually you‚Äôll pay him back. Good luck!
It‚Äôs not mental at all. There are 65M shares out now vs 102M a year or so back, which makes a big difference. If you think about the price to sales ratio and the rapid growth of the e-commerce business it‚Äôs very easy to see a re-rated GME trading over $100 by 2023.

The prospect of a months-long melt-up squeeze may simply accelerate that re-rating in 2021.

Sales will grow from the November inflection point forward, so let‚Äôs give the e-commerce biz a higher multiple and the core biz BBY‚Äôs multiple and you can see it‚Äôs not crazy at all. 

What‚Äôs crazy is the shorts are so convinced of bankruptcy and terminal value zero that they‚Äôve completely fucked themselves

I've found the best way to do it with relative low risk is buy calls with long expiration dates and sell the option as soon as I hit 30% profit. Obviously 30% profit is not super exciting, and I've definitely sold a couple earlier than I should have that would have netted me more profit, but I'm seeing an overall gain.

NIO has more room to drop. It‚Äôs still currently in a downtrend so I would wait till it reverses first. Definitely huge support around $38-40, but it could break depending on news. 

I think NIO day and a lot of other catalysts could send it flying, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs still a Chinese company. There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty surrounding Chinese brands. Honestly I would rather yolo that money on Tesla if I were you.

There are several different ways to calculate theta.   Depending on the pricing model, it might be a standard 7 day week or a 5 day trading week. And to make things more complicated, it is never constant as the theta decays at different rates as the contract approaches 0DTE... The drop isnt an equal x/7 rate.

But in practice, the markets have usually already priced the weekend theta into the premium Friday afternoon...
Was thinking about it, any one you recommend? Needed something with a mobile app since I‚Äôm always working/never on my computer

I've heard a lot of different arguments on this. The most convincing one was technically no but it's baked into the iv of the option
Sorry to hear it. Hopefully they're over insured and will print tendies.
Uhm. I dont, can u please explain? 

Is it where u buy a call and then sell the call an attempts to get the premium while praying someone doesnt exercise their call?

Gme gang rise up and lemme know your thoughts on my thesis for this week.... 

Thesis: gamestonk payed ton of debt early..... but why? Some say its so they can have less debt on books and get stonk price increased. Well yes. But why pay early in this uncertain time. I think they payed it early, because they made bank this quarter and wanted to send a silent message. If you payed attention they haven't broken the silent period, but they have addressed a few of rc's points in their letter, or as much as they could w/o breaking silent period. Personally i feel like this earnings will be one for the ages. Pivotal imo. Gamestonk has payed a ton of debt early (already said that), but why, because they made Bank have plenty of cash on hand and will have a banger of an earnings. Imo this q will be positive by atleast +.03 eps or higher. I know a few people who dropped a few hundred on used games just to get the time to go by. Plus the market is forward looking. All it takes is one analist to say let's hear more about this Microsoft deal. How much money is estimated for gamestonk on this partnership. If the answer is 500 million or more over 5 years shorts are fried. 

Otm weeklie calls are risky. They may or may not pay out. If you have otm calls pull out by Wednesday or Thursday.

800 euro bucks......what the hell is that?  You can buy a case of beer?
So imagine if you're really really confident a stock is about to go up...an option would be the best way to make the most money on that increase.  Even a 10% increase in price could be 2x+ on the value of an option...where a 10% increase if you owned stock would be 10%
Wtf is stronger than diamond? Because those hands are hard af. And so is my dick.

I like this because it shows who makes enough for the difference in rates to matter.
Higher the risk = Higher the reward

I mean, who wants to be eating bagged ramen in a studio apartment in Hoboken when you can bet it all on three incredibly high-risk trades and eat filet mignon and bathe in Dom Perignon at your seaside villa?
Sell $10P then. Not the best risk/reward IMO but there‚Äôs premium to be had for Jan21

I'm expecting $2-4 this week, maybe closer to $2 because I'm more conservative in estimates.
What are your calls for TSLA around 21st this month?

edit: A guy on Etoro did some math that TSLA's cap will increase by 50% on inclusion day. Unless more shares are unlocked, doesn't that mean a 50% increase in share value?

edit2: That would be 12/21 800c, if I could trade options, but I'm stuck with CFD's.

Not everything. But the squeeze landscape makes this question difficult to answer. If the price is $100 and short interest is the same would I sell? No.
The grandparents on the above own real estate. They‚Äôve named the grandchildren as shareholders in the company. In all likelihood this is an LLC. If the LLC holds real estate with mortgages and loan then the debt is not retired. It depends on the operating agreement and the state. While most debts cannot be inherited, it is not absolute with LLCs. You cannot inherit a house from a partnership and not have to pay the mortgage. A mortgage is a debt. If you own a mortgage on a house and you die, your wife doesn‚Äôt just get the house if there‚Äôs a mortgage.

I think Ive already commented in another thread that youre likely just going to lose money if you buy this on day one.

They have let go of like 25% of their employees

Cut all advertisement spending so that they can manufacture a profit for Q3 to put lipstick on their numbers for the IPO, while revenue is down year over year. 

They recently needed a 2 billion emergency injection, in other words they need cash more than ever.

All this would still be fine, if you were to actually buy the dip, since the brand recognition of Airbnb is excellent. Except youre not buying the dip 100% above IPO price, youre likely justing buying into FOMO.

But what do I know, maybe this will be WSBs new obcession. Might still be worth it to short Palantir then.

Oh no. None of this. The call option you paid x premium for is going to have more value when and if the stock price goes up. Then, when you‚Äôre ready, you sell it to some other retard before expiration. It‚Äôs really that simple. If you were to ‚Äúexercise‚Äù and buy the 100 shares then it would be at the strike price. But you‚Äôre not gonna do that.
Lmao obviously I wouldn‚Äôt do it. I was just curious in a hypothetical sense

This is what I hate about alot of people that preach conspiracies. I like to look at other perspective myself, but when you present everything you say as the truth when in fact, its not, you lose a lot of people you are trying to bring to your side.

You‚Äôre missing a few things.

The console cycle has an outsize impact for a specialty gaming retailer. GameStop attaches 2x as many accessories and 3x as many games as mass merchandisers to consoles. Selling the consoles (especially early in the cycle) allows them to achieve very high attachment rates. 

Note the margin degradation you worry about would be more fair if the were only selling hardware, but consider that a massive portion have been through bundles (closet to 20% gross margin than the 10% for standalone consoles).

E-commerce fulfillment isn‚Äôt so expensive when you‚Äôre already leveraging a leased store network for placement and fulfillment optimization ‚Äî they can offer same day delivery (new within the last ~month), in store pickup, etc.

And the closed locations comment is idiotic. They‚Äôre 90/10 strip to shopping mall in the U.S. Go-forward covid closure impacts will be negligible, potentially a positive as consumer entertainment dollars continue to be shifted to video games.

It‚Äôs the same reason out of the money have value. They might not be in the money now, but the more time left until expiration, the more likely it could be in the money at some point.

Basically, even if a contract is in the money, it will be worth more than its exercise value.
People won't stand to let morons who opt out and went broke go homeless by the millions. 

Same reason we can't just ban the uninsured from using ERs. We'd rather have an inefficient system than see that ugliness.

"Earned" is subjective

No one "earns" a billion dollars.  They got there exploiting a rigged system.  There's no "self made" billionaires.  It's like playing monopoly but you only get to roll one dice while your opponent gets to roll two, he starts with 5x more money than you, and when he passes go he gets a thousand while you get a hundred.  Gl overcoming that
My guess would be if you still think the stock has higher to climb. If your exercise, you get the stock. If you sell the option, whoever buys it has the option to buy. I just started learning about this though so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
So I can never lose more than what I paid for the call/put but I can make way more than what I paid for said call/put, I feel retarded that I been missing out on tendies
I wasn't rooting for loss porn, but you better bet your ass I am now after this autistic onanist wankfest. No wonder MB deleted his shit after this response. You can bully people to keep quiet, but you can't bully the market to keep your bubble from bursting. Reality will come eventually, and then I will laugh my ass off.
Conspiracy? It's the truth.

If it weren't the truth, they wouldn't be advocating a program called, "Medicare for All". They would just be advocating "Healthcare for All". They specifically want to expand the reach of the Federal Government here, and aren't even trying to hide it.

The markets can provide healthcare much more efficiently and cheaper here, they just need to wear down the power of these predatory Insurance companies.
No... but I'm betting GLW will have to hit. Gonna need a shitload of vials for a long time.

PLTR started trading on Sep 30, 2020. He states that this is his portfolio as of Nov 29, 2020. There is nothing odd here.

OP is Canadian. Everything is priced in Canadian dollars, fucking retards.

Sorry you have to deal with these retards, /u/banana-flavour. It's a common disorder around these parts. A legitimate gripe I have is that you don't have any screenshots of covered call plays. Although you do have the capability of selling covered calls on multiple stocks you own, you only showed your current exposure and past purchases, but none for the sell-side.

first one to reply to me with some good points
Delta has to do with how much the value of the call changes for how much the price of the underlying stock changes (higher delta means your call increases in value even more for every dollar amount the stock price increases). Theta refers to how much the value of the call depreciates over time (calls lose worth as you get closer to the expiration date). This is why a call loses value sometimes even if the underlying stock is slowly increasing in price (because the price of the stock may not be going up quickly enough to counteract the depreciating value of the call contract over time). And this is why options trading to make money is gambling.

It's a Risk vs Reward.  Because an option is already in the money 6 month early it has value - for the moment.  You can either exercise the option and lock in the value earned (the safe and conservative option) or sell the option to someone hoping it continues to go up in value and will become worth more later, which relies on someone wanting to gamble but there's always someone wanting to gamble.  Selling usually is worth a tiny bit more because there's speculative value added ("it could be worth double tomorrow" - wsb autist), but you risk a bit by not just locking in your profits.

FWIW, exercising also requires you buy 100 shares of a stock at a fixed price, which might be beyond the budget of an options trader.  1 contract for Tesla might cost you $60,000 to exercise when you were only in for a $25 contract that's now worth $1,000.  Selling the contract is just more reasonable than exercising to a lot of people.
i don't think there will continuously be billions of more dollars spent on fancy freezers over a period of time that isn't short
Yes it‚Äôs a tax used that‚Äôs then borrowed from to spend more money we don‚Äôt have. 

Plus when it was implemented in the late 1930s, full benefits were 65. Life expectancy was 62. The program imo was created for those who made it past there working life and out lived there life expectancy. Hence a true safety net. 

The program needs to exist Becusse the sad fact remains, America has a huge retirement savings problem. People don‚Äôt do it and therefore need that hand held by the government to do it for them. 

However, those who are smart enough to plan,budget, save, live within ones means. Could take that money as invest it themselves and have a shit ton more than what ssa pays out. Plus ssa is only passed on to a spouse. After that it‚Äôs gone. You could work your whole life, pay into it and die at 70 collecting only a few years. 

I suppose the argument could be made, one who opts out could yolo it too on gme next week but that should be the degenerates choice!

This is some wild shit. 

Healthcare as a WHOLE is around 20% of GDP. Pharma, research, biomed devices, insurance, hospitals, clinics, billing, dietary, etc. 

Its not like an entire 20% of the GDP would magically go to the hands of exclusively Democrats who are in political positions. Shit, name me a democrat that controls medicare/medicaid money right now, personally, where the same cannot be said about a republican. 

Also, Medicare is already the largest provider of HCI in the nation, with the most satisfication btw, for the cheapest costs, bc they have the biggest dick. Private insurance will, from this point forward, *always and continue to be* shittier, more expensive, less efficient, and associated therefore with unnecessary higher healthcare costs for consumers, while providing businesses with a major financial barrier to overcome and preventing individuals from easily transitioning their career paths / personal lives.

Universal affordable healthcare, likely most expediently provided by a public option, will literally only harm the increasingly irrelevant private insurance companies, and will economically be a boon to everyone's liberty, health, and happiness.

Delta is what the difference the price of the option would change if the underlying stock went up or down, per dollar. 

If delta was constant at .5 and the underlying stock went up $3, then the price of the option goes up by $1.5. Delta does change as the underlying price changes, and that‚Äôs what gamma is. So say we have a gamma of .1 in the above, then after the price movement of $3 up, delta would then be .8

Theta is how much the option loses value every day. If you have a theta of -0.01, then tomorrow your option will be a cent less than it would be today. If theta was -0.1, then it‚Äôd be worth ten cents less tomorrow. 

Note that in these examples stonks are not mentioned and that is because they monotonically increase.

It's like buying a coupon for some apples for a fixed price, like $1 per apple, but the coupon expires tomorrow and the apples sometimes go up in value to like $10 per apple. So you take all of your money and buy these coupons and hope the price of apples go up before your coupon expires and then sell the coupon to some other idiot for more than you paid.

The value of the coupon drops really fast as you get closer to the expiration date, because the other idiot you are trying to sell your coupon to will say "wtf bitch this coupon to buy apples for $1 expires tomorrow and apples are currently worth $0.50. you can keep your coupon I'm gonna go back to having sex with your wife."

And then tomorrow comes and your coupon is expired and you have to deposit more money of your wendy's paycheck into your RH account so you can do it again.

Little secret OP: A lot of what you hear about in WSB WILL hit, but it needs time, and so playing that in shares OFTEN works out very well where an option might be really hard to time right (options = timing). If this is your strategy... and it is making you $$$, do that.
Stonks only go up 70%/year. Options go up or down 100%/month. One of these things is true this year, the other is true every year.

There was a great summary posted just a few days ago about this!

I'm right there with you. I find this stuff to be very complicated betting, having to keep a few "if/thens" in your head to keep track of how I can lose money. So I don't do it.

But the post was a great and fascinating read!

I come to r/wallstreetbets for the memes and read mesmerized the posts of wins and losses. It's like when I go to a casino. Not to bet, mind you, but to watch others as they sit focused on attracting fortune to their hand...

I think this is the most mediocre way to look at this. Pass all you want, but to be clear, the product that already exists is the chunk of a gigantic market (tobacco - 48 billion) that is the **leading killer of people**. And, supposedly per studies, ~65-80% of those people want to either cut down or quit. The value is far more than satisfying an addiction. It‚Äôs cutting down a very common addiction that kills many which affects all. The value is beyond price targets and capital gains; the value extends to human lives. There are many good people in this world who smoke and will lose their lives because of it. It‚Äôs time to end the trend and XXII is contributing, potentially significantly.

It starts off as ‚Äújust social safety net,‚Äù then it snowballs into making sure everyone is equal regardless of the circumstances.

Yes...I worded it badly....the point is that if you manage that size of a gargantuan amount of assets, your earnings will be big from fees.  EPS for black rock is like $30-40 this year and likely over the next couple of years. Meanwhile while SNOW has negative EPS and is worth more than black rock? Sure, different sectors, but come on, a company that makes that much  money per share is worth less than a company that makes negative earnings per share?

It‚Äôs called gamma hedging. Wall Street journal had a good article on it. Basically some people believe such hedging makes the market impervious to bad news. Unfortunately these hedges need to be rolled and so when that happens the reaction can be terrible. This explains last spring...market just did not react too news from China and kept on mooning and finally it crashed. It didn‚Äôt react appropriately.

Probably means that the extrinsic value of the option prior to expiration would be included in the price of the option so that the total value of the option includes some additional premium (extrinsic). The value of the option would increase by its intrinsic value (($40-$20) x 100), and since it‚Äôs In The Money there will undoubtedly be extrinsic value ($) added.

I won't deny that it's about power, but the only reason the Republicans weren't willing to deal earlier was that they already had given up on Trump winning. If Mitch thought passing the stimulus would give Trump the edge, he would have done it because the austerity and fiscal conservatism is their minority position.

Are you me?

I took a break after a couple failed relationships earlier this year and working on myself for the last few months. Meditating every morning, exercising, eating well, etc.

Plan to jump back in to my former lifestyle (while being less of an asshole this time around) in a month or so but until then I'm focusing on other things. I do definitely miss it though and get lonely like a mofo.
Because large social safety nets take a massive bureaucracy to implement, which means significantly more people are dependent on government and therefore can be easily manipulated.

The reason Democrats want socialized medicine isn't because they  want to help people. It's because they want to nationalize 25% of the US economy, which would therefore increase their power significantly. The only reason healthcare is so fucked up to begin with in the US is because of Unions back in the 1970s, which were largely Commie organizations at that time. 

So basically this is all out of the leftist playbook. Use leftist tactics to fuck something up badly, then propose government as the solution.
There are two answers: 
1. SNOW is a cloud based business software. It hooks people with a free version then charges to unlock more advanced software. SNOW‚Äôs value to other companies is its ability to analyze organize and evaluate a company‚Äôs data and give them a path to productivity and profitability gains. The business retention rate is 150%, revenue growth is 170%, and the profit margin is 56% of revenue. 

2. Or: SNOW is a bubble and doesn‚Äôt have any classic way of valuing the company and is therefore overpriced. 

I think SNOW is 1 not 2

Black Rock hold actual assets which could be a liability to the company. Like commercial real estate. In a pandemic offices are closing everywhere. They‚Äôre also heavily invested in coal and oil assets.

14% is great, you dont need options at all. 

If you want them, here's how they work.

Call: let's say it's a call on AAPL. A call is literally the right to buy 100 shares of apple at the "strike price." So if your strike price is 100, and the stock goes to 150, you made out real good. If your strike is 100 but it fucks around at 100, 105, 110, back to 105, 100, you'll see yourself lose money quickly. The further out the strike price is, the cheaper. Also. The sooner the option expires, the cheaper. 

Long story short, buy options with 1+ year til expiry or be sure as fuck about where your stock is going. Still buy mostly shares tho. Options are like bonus bets, you're not supposed to invest in them exclusively.
Personally I‚Äôm fine with a lot of the programs. But one should be able to opt out of paying into social security. Just a scam of a program.

bc vaccine now threatens to solve the problem for the rich people in that they can begin to reopen fully, while the poor people are likely still trying to / delayed in getting employment. Thus, the wealth is much less threatened (so the dems and GOP are both much less motivated to dealmake) and now the Dems are trying to pass something to just give some poorer folks menial relief, while the GOP is amenable to it bc maybe it will help small businesses a bit / larger businesses return to normal faster of more money is in more hands.

I know this isn‚Äôt the right sub for advice but anyway, I don‚Äôt get why you would sell covered calls. Surely you buy shares because you think the price is gonna rise but then you bet against them by selling calls? This also risks you losing the shares if the option is exercised?

Can you explain one more thing please. Let‚Äôs say I bought 20c PLTR at 1/15/21 and the price reached 25, do I have add more money to buy it? Or do I just get the difference? And what does the premium add? Do you get more money if you increase the premium paid?
Don‚Äôt think it was faked, Tesla leaps pricing is off because when it split it doesn‚Äôt split the historical transaction prices so it‚Äôs showing the pricing of a strike that was 1/5th. So a $50 strike post split would show the pricing of the much more expensive $10 strike.
BEcause Dems don‚Äôt care about people any more than Reps when it comes to weighing peoples welfare against their own power. 

They turned it down because they knew Biden was leading the election and they didn‚Äôt want to give trump a political ‚Äúwin‚Äù before the election. The more miserable people were the less likely they would be to vote for trump.

Gonna have 1k in my account by the end of the year. Started with $50. At $230. Let's gooooooooo!
We‚Äôll say your contract is for a $10 call. Stock is at $111 day of expiry. Potentially your contract could be worth at least $101 dollars or maybe 100.99 and even though it may not seem much when you‚Äôre buying thousands of shares it adds up. So basically big investors will to save money anywhere so they pay that much for the contract even if it‚Äôs almost as much as the current stock price

I think this year is when people are starting to realize that it's all a bunch of bullshit. "The market is not the economy" is hilarious to me- because when it was created, it was supposed to be a reflection of it. Abraham Lincoln was opposed to the creation of a privatized central banking system (Fed) because it would lead to "unnatural rises in asset prices and make the market prone to crashes and crises." JFK was opposed to the Fed and was assassinated. It's a very obvious ponzi that is perpetuated by talking heads who have to make up terms to confuse the masses and use excuses like things being "forward looking." We were told that the market would get "a pass" in Q2 because of COVID, which was reason for the initial rise. Then it kept going, so the reasoning became "vaccine optimism." At the end of the day, market is supposed to be the value of a company. You're telling me Live Nation is worth as much as it was 10 months ago, despite not holding a single event since then? It's all a farce.

You have to have options trading allowed on your brokerage account first. Then you ‚ÄúSell to open‚Äù a contract at your desired strike point and expiration date. Make sure you have enough stock to cover whatever options you are selling. 1 contract = 100 shares. Selling ‚Äúnaked‚Äù calls is when you sell the contract without the underlying stock to cover. Probably the most dangerous thing you can do in options since the potential loss is technically unlimited.
Nothing's free. You can god damn be assured that if everyone was getting $2000 a month from the government you're going to pay for that shit in the future.
And what Eman is maxing that out?
Dumbass capitalists manü§¶üèª
The same reason no one wants to read about your weekend sports bets, your new poker strategy or the money you made selling weed.
He can sell the contract? I didn‚Äôt know that. What‚Äôs that call?
Amazing what‚Äôs happening with microstrategy. They used to make a very shitty BI platform but now have basically given up on the enterprise software space and are just a vehicle for holding internet coin. Could be an interesting play on internet coin though
God damn thats a rough life. You are still "young" thought if you don't have any chronic illness you can be around for a old time. My grandpa brother live the same type of life and still do to these day. He got covid from hanging in bars in his 80s and just kicked it last week. But yeah the chronic pain must suck,.
I am in my early 30s and hurt myself at the gym back in September and it is still hurting a little. Usually I feel like I would have been okay 2 days later. I also stopped drinking because now hangovers just ruin my days.

Options are contracts that allow but don't require the buyer to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a pre-set price. Calls mean you want it to go up, puts mean down.

If I buy a $100 call for ABC and it expires next friday, I need it to surpass $100 by friday to start making money. $100 is called the strike price. And friday is the expiration.

But I also had to pay to get the option. If I paid $1 per share for the option, I'd have paid $100 for the option. $1 is the premium. So I really need the stock price to reach $101 to break even, this is the break even price.

On Friday, if the stock price is less than $100 my option is worthless. But if it's worth more than $101, all gains that day are multiplied by 100x. Because on friday I can still by 100 shares for $100 each. If the stock is now worth $110, I can immediately sell them for $1000. I paid $100 at the start so I get $900 profit.

Rather than owning 1 stock in the company indefinitely, I can take on more risk, to maximize my reward. I only control these 100 stocks for a limited time, but I control way more than I could have for the same price by buying stocks.

Edit: this is just a basic explanation. There are plenty of nuanced concepts involved. And while I have a decent grasp of what options are in a basic sense, im by no means an effort. I'm basically retarded, im down 90% this year üò§.

I recommend [this guy](https://youtu.be/SD7sw0bf1ms) on YouTube. He has a good explanation of what options are, how to trade them on robinhood and TD Ameritrade.

He also has videos explaining what "the greeks" are which are Greek letters that represent variables in options trading.

He also has videos explaining what "spreads" are. Which let you take on less risk for less reward, or more risk for more reward.

And just remember no matter what anyone here says, it can almost always go tits up.

Edit 2: again I cannot stress this enough I'm not good at investing [I'm down 90%](https://imgur.com/a/DqU0EyW)

You‚Äôre the smart one bud. Buying stocks and forgetting about them is the true way to go when it comes to investing. Try dipping your feet into other avenues of investing like real estate and you‚Äôre start to become a mogul!

Biden doesn't care about weed and won't touch it. If Democrats win the Senate, they MIGHT pass the MORE Act. But that's a legit gamble. You'd only need one Democrat to flip (Manchin) and it'll fail.

As someone who works in the BI sector, PLTR is a good meme stock but a terrible actual stock.

Almost every other BI vendor out there today can do what they do - real time or near real time data aggregation from multiple raw sources.

PLTR's advantage is their existing government contracts and contacts, and their solutions arm which seems to be good.

But even with that advantage they haven't been able to turn a profit, and how long until a competitor bribes the right people to bring another product in? Be careful.

The only real difference between buying stock and a call option is the option has an expiration date. When you buy stock, you're betting that companies price goes up... eventually.  When you buy a call, you're betting the price goes up in a specific time period, and you make a lot more money if you're right on options.

I missed the interview for my dream job.

I networked, studied, and practiced for weeks to prepare.

I left on time the day of the interview.

On my way to the interview, I saw a stray dog on the side of the street.

I pulled over and spent the rest of the day taking care of the dog. I fed it, gave it water, and took it to a local shelter who arranged for it to be adopted by a loving family.

The next day, I called the company and asked if I could reschedule the interview.

"There's no need," they said, "You're already hired."

Turns out the stray dog I helped was the CEO.

The moral of the story is that I'm an amazing person at all levels. Please like and share.

Ive fucked one girl with DDs, but she was the only unattractive girl ive slept with so she doesnt count.

I had a great sexual relstionship with a C cup, but every other one has been wayyyy more full of themselves than the A cup girls, who are super generous and (historically for me at least) less likely to play games.

Im programmed now to pursue highly attractive A cups over the others now cause i know the emotional return and generosity is way higher.

Its like C cups are high premiums and low returns, but A cups be those Nio calls before WSB caught on.
Thays actually great advice. I like your style haha. Not even trying to be serious with her. Shits unreal. This has been happening online all over the place too but this is the first time I've seen it irl lately. Other then i own a business and the customers have all fucking snapped too so it makes perfect sense
No you really don't know options. There are way more quant analysis involve. There are infinite number of strat/combo to pull out. And by the way, you can edge and modify your risk and premium by buying √† further naked option ITM or simply with a longer DTE.

This...never seen a sustained hype stock like this ever so I don't fuck with it
TSLA
Somebody sold him that contract, hoping it would expire worthless. In that case, that somebody would have have made a profit: he would have just kept the premium the guy paid for the contract.

It looks like this isn't going to happen. That guy holds a bunch of contracts allowing him to force that someone to sell him Tesla stock for (e.g.) $500 a piece. But Tesla stock is worth $600 dollars - so if the option expires/executes, that someone has to sell him Tesla at a $100 loss per stock. 

This is where the money is coming from.

It comes from whoever sold all of those options to him. If I‚Äôm thinking of the same Tesla guy I think he had like 20 call contracts? So he will be owed 20x100 stocks of Tesla upon expiration. Or it comes from other people wanting to buy those calls off of him for very high premium because they are guaranteed in the money
Sigh...
Yeah see the second part is the part I don‚Äôt get. Surely the higher price of Tesla is compensated by the higher price of the option? Or am I seeing this wrong and is the rich asshole in fact making profit if he buys and immediately exercices the option. If this is the case then wouldn‚Äôt this be free money?

Because I feel like it makes sense to sell the highest strike I think is probable to expire worthless if the assign risk doesn't bother me. If it goes below 40, that's the only real downside, but I think that's unlikely.

If it expires and you did nothing with it, it is worthless.

2. He can sell the contracts to some rich asshole who will pay him a million for his contract because the price of Tesla is that much higher than the stock price in the contract is.

All an option is is a contract to buy or sell a stock to or from someone else at a set price on a set date.  The stock price at that date determines who makes money.

Every day the stock price changes and the value of the option contract changes based on likelihood of hitting that price.

The market doesn‚Äôt think. It doesn‚Äôt look. It does not have sentience. A stock does not ‚Äúwant‚Äù to move anywhere. It‚Äôs a bunch of monkeys heaving money into it and hopefully taking out more than they brought.

I probably wouldn't under most circumstances.

I'm 34. If I magically dumbassed my way to like $10 million I'd still want to fill my days with productive work I can be proud of. I like my job, the people I work with, and feel accomplished most of the time. I don't want to leave that behind.

My wife would probably take some time away from her job, but she's also happy with her work. We have kids so it would be silly to  have that much money and have them in daycare when a parent could stay home with them.

I guess there are other ways to feel accomplished without subscribing to the 8-5 life, but I don't want to coast at this point in my life.
Nah
I feel like large tech IPOs are the closest thing to free money there is.

Surely some of you are at least semi-aware of the Humbl merger this week.  Tendies incoming bitches.

You have a job?

Yeah. Exactly right. Monday is going to be very interesting. I expect a gigantic afternoon like we saw EOW last week but bigger.

Court hears case on Wednesday so a deal to avoid that will be announced Tuesday if there's a deal. The treasury and Trump admin knows the court is gunna rule against the gov and in favor of the shareholders. Most conservative court ever.

Anyways, Monday am may be last time we see this thing at $2 or even $3. Announcement puts it at $5 and NYSE listing in 6 months puts it at $10 easily. Some people following this online are projecting $20 share price given how big the company is.

Here is a list of companies that it exceeds in revenues:

1. Bank of America
2. Home Depot
3. Wells Fargo
4. Citigroup
5. Johnson and Johnson
6. Raytheon 
7. Boeing
8. Target
9. General Electric
10. Dell Technologies 

And you wanna tell him this stock should be at $2.50, lol. This thing is gunna popppppppp tendies...

I'm a big fundamentals guy and I got bent over by Jerome and the Fed. I've been playing the rise but still have 60% cash because the fundamentals are even worse than before...right now especially we're on a knife's edge, starting to open short positions again with my 40%.

Sadly, this dream is fake.  Without going into "how did he acquire calls of $TSLA at $0.23", I just consulted photoshop, and an answer was revealed to me.  If this was truly a screenshot, from his phone, without getting re-compressed (uploaded/downloaded) more than once, then the kerning should be perfectly consistent.

Alas, it is not.  The spacing between the decimal and the 2 on "$0.23" is different than the spacing in "$136.23" - he probably used paint to make a copy of the "23" number from the TSLA break even price and put it under avg cost, but he put it one pixel to the right from where it should be.  NOTE - this effect can NOT be due to compression.  Compression could shrink/enlarge the numbers appearance from their sub-pixels, but it cannot entirely shift a full arrangement of pixels to the right or left.  Additionally, the image is suspiciously crisp to even suggest it's gone through compression/decompression.

Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL](https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL) \- The $0.23 is dragged above the $136.23, aligning decimal points.  Space between decimal point and number 2 is only 5 pixels for "0.23" but its 6 pixels for "136.23"

Alternate proof: [https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG](https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG) The .23 from avg price was given 50% opacity, colored red, dragged over location to align decimals.  The break even price was colored blue. You can see decimal is perfectly purple, but the numbers of a layer of red on the left and a layer of blue on the right.

Edit - Apparently imgur compressed. So heres a screenshot of it open in gimp for higher resolution [https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k](https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k)

TLDR - The image you're seeing can only be made through repeated compression/decompression, or photoshop. Likely the latter.

American Options, yes.
European Options, no.

Also, usually it‚Äôs preferable to sell the options to exercising it because there is always some ‚Äútime-value‚Äù for the option.

Let‚Äôs say the stock price is $40 and the strike price is $20. If you exercise you would get $20/share.

However if you sold, you would get more than $20/share.

You buy Cs when things are zooming and you buy Ps when everything's going to shit. When there's a number there, that's to show how much money you're going to make when you're right. The date is when you want to get that money. 

Example: 12/10 SPY 420c means you've bought a Zoomie on SPY that's going to pay you a lot on 12/10 'cause the number is so big. Vs 12/10 SPY 200p means you've thrown your money away on SPY Poopies and on 12/10 you're not going to have shit because the number is so small and it's also a retarded play. 

You are now ready to get approved for level 4 options. Get out there and have fun!
The one thing I don‚Äôt get about options is where the money comes from in case it expires
Holy shit why
Where do you see that?

Yeah sure. Did he have square pants too?
Calls are uppies and puts are downies retard
Overwhelmingly bullish market = low IV.

Calls go down in price with lower IV because short sellers typically use calls during bear markets to protect their short stock positions.... at latest thats what I've always thought. Thats the only explanation I can think of for why IV affects calls the same way it affects puts

Meh, only about $5-10k....mostly for emergencies.  Push comes to shove, I can put more on a credit card and pay it off all at once.  Most of my wealth is invested. I hate holding cash.  After inflation, and an interest rate of .00000001% that you get these days from banks and bonds, you lose money holding a lot of cash.  Even high yield savings accounts have shitty interest rates.   

If I hit an extreme emergency, I can always pull cash out of a roth ira penalty free.  After that I can liquidate all of my brokeage account for more money.  If all of that is wiped I can take loans from my 401k that I pay interest on towards myself anyway as a last resort in a doomsday scenario.  

I hate lots of cash. 75% of my paychecks go into investing after all bills are paid.

So my grandparents used all their grandchildren in a questionable tax shelter scheme for my entire life by giving us all stock in their company, but not actually paying out distributions, therefore cutting their tax burden by 20%. Now the company is dissolving, and supposedly I am going to get a final distribution which should barely cover my tax losses over the years, but I'm mostly just pissed knowing that I have to wait until the end of the year or later and can't put it to work now.

>Some guy said it'll only cost 25 billion so it must be true!

>is there something I'm missing?

Lol yes.  The federal government spends 3 times this amount on food programs annually and roughly 80 times that amount on an assortment of programs for the poor. These sort of quixotic, millenarian visions of the future almost always cost much more than their proponents suggest they would. He seems to be suggesting that  "raising the purchasing power of the food insecure by 26 billion" alone would fix the problem, but administrative costs alone would probably double this guy's estimate. 

Sides, I think it's healthy to be skeptical that some guy with a poly sci degree would have the answer to "solving hunger" and saving the federal government billions of dollars in outlays. Even if he were an economist with a focus on agriculture, these claims should be met with skepticism.
Lets say a stimmy passes and there are no checks and it all goes to big companies. would QQQ 3 months out 5% otm be the play or is there anything mor specific that might work better

Well im poor so i was gonna buy a few 700/750 12/31s. Maybe 750/800. These were 800-1k or so on friday , max profit be 5k minus the cost. Then ive been holding some shares.

#You guys are STILL all fucking retarded for believing this isn't edited. 

**If you guys haven't been around long enough to know the lengths people go to lie and LARP on here, you haven't been around long enough.**

Other people have pointed out fishy shit on the options chain. First of all, Tesla LEAPs for fucking twenty cents? **Yeah, strike one.**

The biggest one? https://imgur.com/a/ZUtVmBD Look at the OP's "All Time" screenshot on Imgur. TURN YOUR BRIGHTNESS ALL THE WAY UP.

**YOU CAN SEE A TEXT BOX DISCOLORATION WHERE THE ALL-TIME IS EDITED. YOU RETARDS.**

**STOP FALLING FOR THIS SHIT**

Also, here's my previous comment on why you guys are absolutely retarded for falling for this. More evidence:

---

So, so far, for evidence that this is **absolute bullshit** and you guys are all retarded for falling for shit like this all the time, is:

- The image he linked for his All timeline is missing percentages and start date. You can also see the edits he made if you look closely enough with low brightness. Fake.

**And also:**

- The $136 contracts didn't exist until September 2020. But even if you pick a similar contract that did exist such as the 15Jan21 120C they only went from $20(if bought at the bottom in 2019, split adjusted) to $500, which is a 25x return(2500%).

[He's the chart for the 140C(700 pre-split)](https://i.imgur.com/LYnMv2n.png)

[He's the chart for his imaginary 136C, they didnt even exist until September](https://imgur.com/ogsJ6PZ)

**To which OP Replied (and got downvoted for being exposed):**

**"That is because this when the stock split. A $680 call becomes 5 $136 calls on a 5 to 1 split that happened... you guessed it... in September 2020."**

**Nope.** Contracts don't stop existing after split, they split just like the stock...again you show you're a lying fgt...also split was in august not that it matters. And as I said, the numbers I gave you are split adjusted already.

Nice larping though fgt

mods plz ban this fucker.

I don't have a dog in this fight, with the closest position I have is an order for some calls in MRVL after their dip this week.   But the question posed was why are people hating on them.  They've botched two quarters, and this quarter they wouldn't take questions during the conference call from the analysts that grilled them the prior one.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-23/intel-dodges-wall-street-critics-on-another-tough-earnings-call](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-23/intel-dodges-wall-street-critics-on-another-tough-earnings-call)

Two key graphs:

*The world‚Äôs largest chipmaker is at the center of a debate about its future, one that its detractors are winning. They argue that multiyear delays in introducing new manufacturing technology has cost Intel its main competitive advantage and rivals are going to thrive at its expense.*

and,

*‚ÄúWhile we thought last quarter‚Äôs call was bad, last night‚Äôs was potentially even worse as fundamentals are now deteriorating at an alarming pace,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúFrankly, while CEO Bob Swan suggested 2020 has been the most challenging year in his career, we have to believe that 2021 is going to be worse.‚Äù*

I think you can add to it that Swan wasn't the first, second, or third pick for CEO and Intel had to basically settle for him after a year long + search for a new CEO.  There's just not any confidence that the company can keep up right now.

This is why there are markets.  If you're right, there's money to be made here when they get things squared away and return to form.  If the analysts are right, Intel becomes a next tier commodity producer in an industry that only values innovation.

Also, congrats to OP for seeing value when most were bailing.
What are ‚ÄúOct‚Äù calls? Are you calling the 12/11 calls as Oct?

Ok
I'd bang her
Ive been thinking about this a lot lately.

Of course "the big crash" everyone talks about being on the horizon could happen like 100 years ago..

But how many 401ks were there in 1920? We have  a hige amount of money pouring in every week from that alone, international exposure thanks to globalization, and my main man JPOW backing up the market no matter what.

Also while retail traders obv arent as big of a deal as MM, how much does retail fuck with MM algos which cause a kind of self fulfilling prophecy?

Idk, im pretty dumb so maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, but if a global pandemic crash can recover in a few months, I don't know how we could actually crash anymore.

I like this. I don‚Äôt have $4,000 to sell the put though.
It's okay just go back to your broker and tell them you meant to buy NIO not PLTR puts, they will totally understand and fix it.
How much cash do you guys keep in the bank? I'm 95% invested most of the time and keep minimum amounts of cash for bills.

I'm curious about this as well. Intuition tells me covered calls favor volatile stocks but I could be wrong. Would love to hear from theta veterans how they make their moves
They will absolutely pull every dime of profit they made this year when January hits; they're gonna roll their taxes to 2021 and pull the rug so fucking hard, IMO
So this is the fucked up part, I live in Canada and I feel like this is exactly what the gov is trying to do. They either lockdown and fuck the economy to save a bunch of people that will likely die in 10 to 15 years anyway and be a drain on social services OR they let them die and save the economy... 

Which seems like the most logical solution in a country where one of the biggest healthcare nightmares we've been discussing for years is the financial burden the boomers will be on our universal healthcare... Fucked but true

Then you should split your current position in half, invest one half in memes, and invest the other half in literally anything else. Maybe buy some boomer stock to sit on... or Maybe brakes for your car? Maybe a dentist visit you've been avoiding. Something terribly boring yet expensive, that you have neglected. Or an investment more "stable" than the memes.

Absolutely. The weak and old are dying, AKA, burdens. We should benefit greatly from their deaths, part of the reason why I‚Äôm against all lockdowns/mitigation efforts by the government. They throw around 2 million deaths like that‚Äôs supposed to make me want to lockdown, wrong. Makes me want to go out and socialize with some fat welfare queens.
If you think a better thing will happen but it‚Äôs more likely a reverse thing will happen
yeah I took a little hit. Glad I rolled my 12/4 to 12/11. They might rally with the rest of 5G this week. I may recoup the 600 (net 300) I lost Friday.  I bought the dip in leaps.

Leverage...500 in stock is just that...stock. However, 500 in options contracts is 100 shares per contracts... so depending on what you bought at. You can control 50k worth of stock with 500. More control = more money to be made and lost. This person was on the lucky side of the coin.

What are the moves for this week? Need some tendies.
[deleted]
**The guy who owns the stock is selling the contract**, so they collect the premium from the buyer of the calls/puts (the premium can be a lot of money if the volatility of the stock is high). They get this premium immediately no matter what happens to the stock price.

If you buy calls or puts and they expire worthless, your max loss is the premium that you originally paid (the person you bought the contract from gets this). They get your money. (whether they profit or not depends on where they stock price goes and if they own it. There's a chance they can lose money if they're selling covered calls and the stock price goes down, but in the end selling those calls is downside protection)

Here's the issue, I think the old way of thinking is dead. The market has always been irrational but I think it's truly gone off the deep end, but it's literally too big to fail. The market is a major reservoir for retirement savings and overall wealth, it can't afford to plummet indefinitely. That's not to say a flash crash can't happen if there's an extreme shock but it's basically, get the fuck in the market or inflation is gonna leave you behind.

TLDR; Stonks only go up.

#RKT or PTON ?
would you sell just prior to earnings even if you thought the earnings would be good news and the stock would go up?
With IV so high your best bet would be to buy a vertical call. I‚Äôm looking into this myself now. Buy a jan 2022 45c and sell an 80c. The trade costs $668 with a max gain of $2,800. If it‚Äôs above $80 at expiration you‚Äôd be looking at a 420% gain. 

I would be looking to back the 80c if IV comes down or when it gets closer expiration.

The simplest way to describe options: You pay extra money, to make a riskier play, with more specific timing, that loses value as it gets closer to the expiration date. It's probably good you don't really know what it is, because it's the only real way you can lose money on stocks even if they go up. That said, options is also how you risk money to get huge returns. If you don't even know what options are, just don't do it. Learn everything you can before you dive in to lose your first 1000.
This is the way!  Now show us that loss porn baby!

JPM 110p 12/31 would be a solid bet. The big reason banks have gone up so much is because of yields rising and vaccine news, coming up this week is the earliest that the FDA can approve a vaccine if it doesn't get approved we'd likely see bank stocks dip abit.
No doubt in my mind gonna rip hard tomorrow after the Cramer pump and merger vote. Could hit $25-$30 this week easy.
If you're knee deep in puts, you're either going to print money at Monday's cash open or you need to get out of those positions. Nothing is going to happen after the bell besides more melting up. The only way this market is reversing is in the pajama session to trap retards buying at ATHs

You're in WSB and you're asking why retards do retarded things. Just last week we saw meme overload because so many people here lost shittons of money by gambling on weekly PLTR calls.

People here aren't investing. They're gambling. Weeklies are cheaper up front cost than LEAPS. They're gambling that it does shoot up by then and they'll be able to make a ton of money. But it's all a gamble.
How many hours do you retards put into actual research? I have about 50 stocks and 50 options to keep track of, on top of looking into every companies filings/trades/charts and just plain news. 2-4 hrs on a trading day. ~2hrs after closing. I dont trade AH....but i do this with a full time job...

Not saying the TSLA post isn't fake, but here's [proof](https://i.imgur.com/MCdmpj5.png) for you tards that don't believe that TSLA 01/15/2021 calls were trading that low. Yes that's $680 strike because assuming it's not fake that's what the original poster bought because they were purchased before the split happened. $680 strike divided by 5 is his weird $136 strike

Tastyworks does not adjust the price for the split, it states what it was traded at on that exact date so you need to divide the price of the option by 5 as well. You also see a massive difference in the option's price when the split happened and I showed where it was by using a red line.

I found the lowest price I could which was like 30% less than what OP bought them for. $0.23 x 5 = $1.15 premium. They were definitely trading below $1.15 for quite a while. Notice that massive window to buy and all we had to do was hold. $500 into almost a million

^(ok end of rant, i'll fuck off)

edit: 0 balance because it's my GF's new empty account
He bought options on TSLA. He didn‚Äôt buy the stock. He bought the right to buy the stock. 1 contract = 100 shares, and he bought 20 contracts. He bought them a long time ago with a strike price that it was so far out that the contract only cost 23 cents. I.e whoever is on the other side of that trade thought ‚Äòthis is so unlikely to happen, I‚Äôm happy to just take 23 cents for doing nothing‚Äô.
Piece of cake with options. YOLO the wrong way on earnings is an easy way to do it.
Let's be clear. Yoy always get to keep the premium no matter what. The question is whether you have to sell your shares or not.
Bitches don't know about redemption.
It would be more profitable if you were right.  You lever your portfolio like this and then a sustained down trend like 08 would murder you.  Who knows if we will ever see such a trend again with the fed doing what they are doing though.

Basically, it‚Äôs like this. He bought 1 contract that gives him the right to purchase (a call) 100 shares of PLTR at 20 dollars (strike price) a share by 1/15/21 (expiration). If the price of PLTR is 20 dollars or above, he is IN THE MONEY and if the contracts expires while the price remains at or above his strike price, he profits. If the price of PLTR is below 20, he is OUT OF THE MONEY and remains below 20 at his expiration, the contract will expire worthless and he will lose whatever money he paid for that contract. That is the basics of a call contract. 

Now there are other factors to consider, such as the amount of money he paid for the contract which is called the premium. The premium is comprised of two factors called the intrinsic value and the extrinsic value, but that gets a little bit more complicated. Just know that he has paid a premium for that contract and he will need to clear that premium at expiration to make a profit. So if he paid a 1 dollar premium on that contract (1 x 100 shares = 100 dollars) he will need PLTR to be above 21 dollars to be profitable.

Edit: Just a retard helping fellow retards be a little bit less retarded. I had no idea this comment would blow up. I‚Äôm trying to answer as many questions as I can while at work.

Just type your income online. Taxes is just copy and paste
It's very simple and most people explain it absolutely retardedly.

I'm not going to explain puts because they're magic (yes I know how they work but I'm drunk and don't care to explain them)

When someone creates/sells a **Call** Contract, they are saying "I will be obligated to sell the buyer of this **Call** Contract 100 shares of this stock at the strike price by the expiration date" (assuming the stock reaches the Strike price by the expiration date). They also collect a premium for selling this contract

When you buy a **Call** Contract, you are given the right to buy 100 shares of this stock at the strike price **from** the contract writer when you exercise the contract (assuming the stock reaches the Strike Price at all).

"1 20c 1/15/21 PLTR"

1 contract

20 strike Call (c) Contract

1/15/21 expiration

PLTR stock

This contract can be exercised because PLTR is above the Strike price and the buyer can purchase 100 shares from the seller for $20 per share (PLTR is currently above $20 per share and so the buyer of the contract will make a profit on this trade).

A lot of the time these contracts aren't exercised though, because you can resell the contract for money. Exercising the option would mean owning PLTR at $20 per share which you may not want to do.

The writer/seller of the contract is a chad no matter what because they collect the premium that you pay when you buy the contract and most likely owned PLTR before it was $20, so collected the difference between their average price and $20 as well.

SPY 200P
God, Brexit talks are apparently still going on.  How long does it take to negotiate an exit?
I'm in the same boat. I just started looking it up. So when you but a call, you are paying someone who has the stock you are interested in to guarantee a purchase price (strike price) for you at a later date. If the stock guess up, you can buy the stock for the strike price agreed upon. If the stock guess down, you are only out the money you paid them (that's called the premium). 

Puts are where you are paid a premium and agree to buy the stock at an agreed upon price (strike price) on a certain date. So if the stock guess down below the strike price you have to buy it for more than it is currently worth. If the stock is above the strike price on that date, nothing happens and you get to keep the premium that was paid to you.

Calls and puts are known as "options"
Have calls but what makes you confident

22% in circulation, not inflation. Inflation will probably be closer to 3-4% for 2021 and then who knows from there. So whatever percent you‚Äôre up, deduct 4% vs historically around 2%. You just hope it‚Äôs not a hyper-inflation scenario in a couple of years. Google ‚Äòhyper/inflation Venezuela‚Äô to see what happened there a couple of years ago...
Closing out everything except my losers (2021 tax strategy lel) and opening up a mid term bearish hedge once we clear 370. But I want, like, a spicy hedge. An spy 300p is boring.

I've tried digging into it too. It was trading just under $200 last June which makes the cheap leaps questionable. The price is plausible for a boring stock flat stock, but not one as volatile at Tesla.

No they did not. A type designer did. It's called tabular lining. The space between the decimal and number was already set by the type designer and kerning is ignored since it's lining numbers.

I went to a mini super spreader event last night with my friends. It was a pretty fancy affair too with fondue(both chocolate AND cheese) and wine decanters and a raclette which something you degenerate monkeys probably have never heard of. Anyway I made a bunch of jokes about covid and then I overheard the cute girl I was working on mention her dad died of it earlier this year. So I probably fucked up that opportunity!

Feel like there have been no surprises on this. Unlike spring/summer/fall, people tend to stay inside more often anyway. The economic losses from COVID are far less.

Plus we've seen this song and dance before. Markets are factoring it all in more. Look at vaccine news pumps through November. The Pfizer vaccine news had Dow opening up nearly 2000. Following events were less.

Things that are bearish are all the same and we've been seeing them all year. The summer spike was not anticipated and caused more selling. This winter spike has been advertised for a while.

Also, who the fuck knows really. I sure don't. I just don't get paid nearly as much as the boneheads on CNBC to know nothing.

Your calls are fine.

i looked into it and maybe it is fake but those calls were really trading for less than what he paid for it 1-2 years ago, so it definitely could have been done

i also found NIO calls that were trading at $0.03 premium in 2018 and they recently were trading over $40.00 premium, in other words $3 into over $4,000 each call
Just ignore them, very low chance anything will happen

agreed. everyone around me is all worried about people dying of corona/lockdowns, meanwhile im over here checking the hot stocks and counting my tendies. 2020 has been radically different for me than most people. i actually got a huge leg up this year thanks to the stock market.
What the hell, he told me I could have it. I guess we can share?

I mean - this country has been broken for a long time.  And this virus could be the beginning of a necessary reset.  So I‚Äôm hopeful.
I had an interview with a woman. She came in 15 minutes late. Covered in shit and urine. She smelled like she lived in a dumpster.

I get the same feeling, I think, right before I have to get blood drawn. It this weird exhilarating nervousness, as I‚Äôm sitting there waiting, watching the phlebotomist as she expertly moves around the room. 


My arm, laid out on the arm rest, hand clenched as she probes the crook of my elbow for just the right spot. With light but firm pressure she makes sure she knows her target. 


‚ÄúJust a small pinch...‚Äù she says softly, as she steadies the needle.


I draw in a small shallow breathe as I feel the tip of the needle against my skin. My body begins to feel flush, the hairs on my arm and back of my neck stand up. My eyes ,wide open, are locked on the needle, the rest of the room seems to fade away...


&nbsp;

...Then I feel it. That sweet. Sweet release.
Yeah exactly agree. Since I have longer dated calls, I‚Äôll
probably buy more and average down for the Jan recovery on the remaining calls. Thank you for your autistic insight, I appreciate it!

They don't.  Retards here turn it into losses.
I keep telling people this virus is the best thing to happen to me.  1) save money on rent 2) student loan forbearance 3) massive gains in the market.
At some point there will be no more shares outstanding to give and shorts will have to cover? The squeeze is inevitable. I‚Äôm all in ü§ù
But there‚Äôs so much money & attention (money) in people thinking you‚Äôre some kind of god with investing (and somehow by association finance).

If only it wasn‚Äôt all my friends & families money I‚Äôd be losing

I‚Äôm not taking advice from someone yoloing in gme. Lol.  Nobody is 100% sure what‚Äôs going to happen, but it‚Äôs pretty clear gme is a garbage company and this forcing of a short squeeze strategy might be the most autistic move in all of wsb history.  There is a reason why short interest is so high.  You will need a lot of manpower to really scare the shit out of the shorts. You might get it pumped up here and there but it will almost always dump after.  It‚Äôs unreal that some of you think it‚Äôs going to $50. Lol. You think this is tesla?  Tesla has a future. Gme doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve seen stupid shit happen though so why would I make a medium risk low reward sideways play on gme when there are many stocks I could put myself into at the same or lower risk with high rewards.

You keep talking about why I‚Äôm not making a play on gme if I really know all this. I‚Äôll make a deal. Take out the biggest loan you can and all in gme, then I‚Äôll make a sideways play in gme.  If you really know this short squeeze is going to work, you would risk everything on it. Right?

DCA 20 bucks from each paycheck into a swing position.
Sep start: SPY was at 358, now 3.5 months later, it's at 367, 3.35% up. QQQ was 302 and now at 305, less than 1% in 3.5 month. So, no, sir. I am not joking at all.
When you get those responses you know you're doing something right, or are just a retard.
Meh I've been to hell and back a few times early on. Those first couple hundreds/thousands invested that were momentary lost were the most painful, but made me strong and better understand the emotions others fall victim to. 

Investing is not for everyone for some the mental strain of lossing money months on end can cause them to throw in the towel. If you can't handle loss from time to time you will never be able to achieve gains. I held through studied harder, and kept investing every extra cent I made. 

Being able to firmly price companies and maintain solid expectation. This provides the foundation to a level headed behavior. 

I am also a firm believer in buying 5-10 years forward looking. So many people lose by selling to early and only looking a day/month ahead.

Last off options are poison and often kill just like casinos. Your lying to your self if you think it's not gambling...

Meh I've been to hell and back a few times early on. Those first couple hundreds/thousands invested that were momentary lost were the most painful, but made me strong and better understand the emotions others fall victim to. 

Investing is not for everyone for some the mental strain of lossing money months on end can cause them to throw in the towel. If you can't handle loss from time to time you will never be able to achieve gains. I held through studied harder, and kept investing every extra cent I made. 

Being able to firmly price companies and maintain solid expectation. This provides the foundation to a level headed behavior.

Airbnb prices seem to have exploded in my geographies based on the crawler bots I‚Äôve thrown out, with main driver being cleaning fees. 

They‚Äôre no longer cheaper than hotels, and while this is anecdotal, I know a ton of folks who have basically delisted or blacked out dates for the time being just because of COVID hassles.
This is not a good idea. Analysts are overestimating next quarter and pricing in success, whereas last quarter they were doing the opposite. Nike traditionally has bad q3 earnings because they don't benefit from things like people wearing outside clothes in bad weather and the back-to-school rush. 

Most worrying is that fact that NKE ate hog shit in June because of supply chain issues, not sales per se. And with UPS strangling their deliveries, guidance will point to, yes, more supply chain issues.

If you hold through earnings, you are going to lose your pubes. I YOLO'd 20k on NKE and held through earnings in the fall. I posted CROX DD when it was trading around ~45. I know what I'm talking about, probably

As someone who works for big three we are so fucking far behind on autonomous and ev it's not even funny. 

Now let me tell you something about the big three. I work in one of the most productive auto plants in the world. We make a fuck ton of cars at very very high efficiency and low cost. We have retooled this plant before. Let's say it's about 1 million square ft facility. So that gives you an idea of the size. Once we have an ev ready to produce, it only takes 2 weeks to rip out the entire plant to a blank floor and 3 weeks to rebuild it. 

It does take a while to work production kinks out, but as soon as big three are ready to switch to ev it will be like flipping a switch for them. We already have all the logistics, shipping, receiving, parts facilities, subsidiary manufacturers, FIFO supply chains, established quality and testing methods. 

Now I think it's too early to jump in as of yet but I think a company like VW will have the capability to crush Tesla when it comes to manufacturing. 

Now Tesla can still catch up, they can win in design, they can win on sentiment and they may still very well win on technology. It's totally possible they end up getting bought out one day. 

Anyway I'm just an idiot who works in the industry so take what I said with a grain of salt.

I have a big losing credit spread I need to rollout over the end of the year.  If I were to just close it at a loss it would offset a lot of gains, but I think a rollout would be a wash sale and so the gain/loss would all go to next year?  Anyone done this?
I didn't remortgage. I had the choice of getting a house next year but decided to yolo it instead :D. I'm not settled yet, so could afford the risk. Yeah you're right, day trading is 100% gambling. Especially on very volatile stocks.. But making smart investments into well researched companies can pay off. I mean a lot of the ppl posting good/great gains on here keep saying do your research, pick a company that you believe in and hold it for 3+ months. 

The only shit thing for us is they get options and we don't. We just have to CFD/spread bet...

For those bashing PLTR and saying it's going back to 10$, here is an article from 2016, it says that Palantir was estimated to be worth around 25B at the time, the latest fundraising they had back then went for 11.38$ per share. THE IPO (Edit : Direct Listing for the salty gentlemen) WAS UNDERVALUED ! We are almost in 2021 and they stand at a 40B market cap, plenty of room to grow.

This market is ripe for a correction. Don't forget that Trump would have the government pull a rabbit out of the hat weekly to pump the market. Now Trump don't give a fuck since you ain't helping him with his election. Doom is coming. Just look at the chart, S&P hasn't moved up this fast since 2009. That's just the data. Like 17%+ over the 200 day MA. This don't happen ever.

People who wait for the dip usually miss it, happened last week at 38 and I missed it and knew it was coming. Moral of the story is with a winner stock just be happy to get in on a big red day that‚Äôs a discount. In a year from now anyone will be thanking god they got in under 60

I didn't realize I had switched commenters, and thought you were the one talking about Alex Jones being valuable, and that's the context I answered in. As to your specific claim (which is already a loaded question, because it presupposes the conclusion you think analysis should find), I was able to find references to it, and opinion pieces (including negative) on several MSM outlets within 30 seconds of a google search; the WEF website outlining it as *the first result* on google, and tons of opinion pieces from large conservative websites (nationalreview), all the way down to conspiracy, Alex-Jonesy nutjob blogs.
Damn those will pay off huge holy fuck

Big whoop man, we're on a six week lock down that'll go on through the holidays in Belgium right now, except for us it's 30 degrees and not 70. We have a fucking midnight curfew lmao. I'd kill to be in SoCal right now.
Add to that the fact they have way less restrictions on anything they build and sell in Asia, and to some extent Europe, compared to North America. Somebody posted earlier that similar valuation as TSLA would put them 300-350 per share, which is also the price target for several analysts. ü§î
Lmao what if it's photoshopped??
I think we are just hitting that point where even bulls are starting to question whether the indexes should realistically be as high as they are.

Damn, you are well versed at bragging about yourself. That is a practiced skill and I can appreciate the amount of time you must have spent talking about yourself to be that good at it.  As a person, it doesn't have to be because you are Asian.  A lot of people have that mentality, they just show a little humility along with it. It's what we call being a well rounded person. You missed the point. New money is a way of acting. You could have old money and still act nouveau riche. Taking 3 paragraphs to describe how rich you are is a prime example of nouveau riche behavior. Anyways, this has been fun. Some people are better than you. I still think you are 25 at best.

So what happens if there is no additional news?
California on 3 week lockdown. But I was told there would never be another lockdown..
You're conflating analysis with Alex Jones, who does not do analysis, and does not provide a public service. They give the proposal, and if people want to talk about it, they can. But in the end, it's going to be represented in how our country manages our own policies, and that will be the relevant subject of debate people pay attention to. But there's nothing inherently shady about an entity called the World Economic Forum proposing policy goals in the wake of a historic pandemic. There *is* plenty shady about people who tie it to conspiracies about manufactured viruses, and thinly-veiled antisemitism.

Election day for the Georgia runoff is on January 5th. It may be on people's minds, but I doubt it would have a major effect.  The smart money is on the Repubs winning because dems only show up for Presidential elections.  Also, both parties are on team Wall Street.  They may make noises to the contrary every once and again, but that's all that ever is, just noise.  There is a better chance of Biden and Pelosi winning gold medals in the Summer Olympics for synchronized swimming than them biting the hand that feeds them.

Ah, yes, of course. I think I mixed something up. Thank you for the detailed help!
The Great Reset proposal was literally a public announcement with detailed, publicly available policy suggestions. They literally published a fucking book on it. You can disagree with them, but it's not some service Alex Jones is providing by evoking it for the pure reason of being nuts, and monetizing the fear aroused by a bunch of unsubstantiated claims he finds by anonymous idiots on the internet who don't have hobbies. The WEF, which proposed it, has zero authority to make it happen anyways; all the New World Order, coronavirus conspiracy trash it brings along is hysteria for idiots. And people like Alex Jones dabble in it because that's how they put food on the table. And claims that it's some shadowy organization pulling strings behind the scenes are baseless, paranoid, and in lock-step with the dime-a-dozen conspiracies these groups put out which are wrong 999 times out of 1,000. Yet, somehow *they're* the ones just trying to get the truth out, despite constantly being wrong, while everyone else is "in on it," and doing nefarious, evil things. 

Actual evil is almost always more mundane, and these wild conspiracies are not credible, don't hold up to even minor genuine scrutiny, and are boring, because they're all the same.
I cant wait to see what BB opens at on Monday. Slowly gaining retard strength üòÇ

I remember back in September, I said all they have to do is keep talking about stimulus and market will keep going up. If it ever passes, it will be one of those, sell the news events. They know exactly what they are doing lol.
If you do the research, those options did not exist until summer 2020 which is a year after he supposedly purchased
No doubt

I'm talking like in your 30s.
Funny because it seems most people are bullish on it. Do you really think Pre NIO day run isn‚Äôt going to go to new ATH? They are only going to keep growing so why wouldn‚Äôt people hop in now while it‚Äôs 30 percent or more under the value? Just thinking logically, so are most buyers and institutions. Most of them are greedy and think they will snag it under 40 but plenty of people are happy getting in at current level since in a year it will be well over 100
Sorry. If you buy 100 shares at $100, and you sell one call option with a strike price of $125, if on the day of expiry the stock is above $125, you will receive $12,500 ($125 * 100), no matter how high the stock price is above $125. 

So your profit is $2,500 plus the premium you got when you sold the option.

If it's less than $125, you keep the premium and the shares.
Are you a boy or a girl?
How do you figure that?  I realize it's a long time but I am not very hopeful for their future.  Their 52 week high isn't even 10$.  I say this as someone holding shares too.  Is there news I dont know?

How did you go negative when you started with $500? Generally you need more than that before you can trade on margin or write naked options.

Anyway, the easiest way to get your account from $500 to 1M in a year is to deposit another $999,500. A lot of folks that build up massive accounts are adding more cash as they go. You also have to remember that we went through a crazy year. Anyone that yolo'd on a DEC option back in March would have made massive profits. Doesn't even matter what the stock was.
 
As for what you can do right now with 500, I think you've got a few choices. Buy 1 share of something big, like TSLA. Buy a lot of something small, like GME, X, GE, RIOT, etc. Or buy one or two options on just about anything. Just remember that options can expire worthless, while stock will generally always be worth *something*.

Yea. As an ex-user people fail to realize that it's not the drug itself that hurts you anywhere near as much as the side effect of staying up for days. Lack of sleep kills.
I understand but isn't state tax 7-8% a lot of states? So what I'm getting at is you're almost offsetting the 10% by moving.

Edit: a quick Google search I found 8-11% among the highest states.

Twitch Plays Pokemon had a bunch of people try to beat a Pokemon video game by typing the names of the button presses in chat, which a bot read and made all the inputs, and it blew up with tens of thousands of people participating. They also had to for certain sections of the game do a "democracy mode" which had everyone vote on which button to press next. There was already a "democracy mode" style brokerage stream a few years ago, but I was wondering if you could do a more anarchic one without trade violations.

They get exercised at the strike. If you sold an NIO 50c 12/31 you'd collect 3.25 x 100 each in premium Monday. And 50 x 100 if it gets exercised. There's no way to lose any actual investment. Possible that NIO could be over 53.25 on that day, but that difference would just be unrealized gains and if you bought NIO at day 25 originally, that's still be over 100% profit in 6 weeks or 25% profit in a month if purchased at $43 a share Monday morning

I had previously commented this elsewhere :

Why? Their platform isn‚Äôt all that great, their ml/ai capabilities (which is not the main product they offer, it‚Äôs the platform) is rudimentary and something that can quite easily be replicated. In their filings they mention ai/ml 50+ times but their main product the platform only once. Seibel management isnt great either, they are bleeding money as a tech company. Their product isn‚Äôt great but their marketing sure is. I‚Äôm not buying but the decision is urs to make. The stock will prolly go up j off hype but imo it‚Äôs a total money grab

You aren‚Äôt gonna make much by ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù $500... for the most part, the people making insane gains are gambling. If you‚Äôre prepared for and okay with your $500 disappearing in less than a day, you have the potential to make a lot of money. Just like if you head to the casino with $500, you have the potential to make a lot of money. If you‚Äôre willing to gamble that $500 (as opposed to investing) you can easily flip that into $5,000-$10,000 with a bit of luck. The problem is knowing when to cash out. The day of the Tesla split my originally $2,000 ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù in a call option was suddenly worth $15,000. My goal was $20,000. A week later my entire account was back down to $4,000. By Monday I was back up to $11,000 and yesterday I ended around $5,500. 

Now personally I‚Äôm okay with this... my goal from when I started this was to try to flip $2,000 to $20,000 within a year or two so I can put a downpayment on a house. Proper investing will not hit that goal anytime soon. My brother, who introduced me to Robinhood and has steadily made 50% gains over the last 6 months without playing options at all, referred to my ‚Äúflashy trading style‚Äù the other day, and I had to stop him and explain that no, I‚Äôm not trading or investing. I‚Äôm trying to win a house downpayment at a casino.

Can confirm. Just read the NEJM article. 2 kids w/ different types of sickle cell underwent gene editing, and after >1 year they both had non-sickle cell traits. The edited, sickle cell correcting, genes were also still active in their body. This is incredible news for the medical community and if they can continue this momentum with additional studies in other chronic illnesses we will see them either being gobbled up by Amazon for trillions of dollars or they will be the greatest medical company that has ever existed for 10‚Äôs of years to come. 

TLDR: Hell yeh I‚Äôm buying CRISPR

I've tried to read up on this but I've been getting different answers. Some articles say it's going to be decided at the meeting on December 10th while others are saying it's going to take a few days/weeks after the meeting to get approved. FDA is having a meeting for Modernas on the 17th of December
Don't give them so much credit. Greed index has been over 90 for a while, and I've thought about dumping my indexed funds as well. Plus, that kind of money means they could have lost a ton in March on riskier shit and needed some tax free profits to counter for EOY.
He‚Äôs dead like the rest of the bears, everyone would do so much better if we all decided to be bulls lmao
Lucky retard. It‚Äôs like a temporary retirement for you
I just started thinking about whether or not it would have been possible to have started a Twitch Plays Pokemon style brokerage back in March. If you disabled options trading, I feel like it would have been nearly impossible for a random group even with saboteurs to have drained an account this year, but I'm not sure how you would make it work mechanically with the legal restrictions.
Yea except there‚Äôs that fact that the company is growing exponentially and will be half of Tesla by next year along with setting up claims in dozens of countries for the robotaxi industry so yea there THAT lmao. All you bears growl but have nothing to back it up
The guy who got 200 000% gains on Tesla. If I did my math right it means that the impact he had on tesla stock with 500 dollars equals to almost 2,4 million dollars buying power on todays share price? If the market makers want to stay fully hedged
If the stonk rises 25% above spot price to the chosen strike you will actually lose that amount because they get taken away at the 25% lower price, and from the difference plus premium you cant buy in again without a loss - no?!
Yes, he could have withdrawn money but my experience tells me otherwise. Unless it is an All Time Chart you can't be sure.

Do not forget. Reddit is still manipulated  by mods to the hilt.

When ever it's to manipulate opinion on a political person or to pump a stock.

As we only saw PLTR gains during the run and we saw orange man bad every sub, mods literally declaring in non political subs (r/law, pics, breadmaking, 500 others) that they support Biden.

So brainwashing works. In this case they portrayed Trympy in a horrible way. Reading comment was interesting. They say thing like: Yeah, I dont think he is as bad is hitler, but I dont like him. BOOM.

Guy was manipulated to not vote for him. Simple as that. Reddit has grait power over manipulating people and making them believe all kind of BS.

Now 99% redditors dont trade sadly, but we can all make money off idiots who got brainwashed.

Same way as the election manipulation, PLTR and countless other stock were pumped and dumped here. I bet 99% of people here never read one single book like random walk or watched any Sykes dvd from 2008. 

But that is good. The day they figure out they were duped and brainwashed, the day I have to go back to work as I can no longer make money off idiots.

Until than, good life.
That selling has been going on already as the delta of calls like this goes down.

Let's say you trade in a roth, and make it big, then want to withdraw early. If you changed residency to a non income tax state, then withdraw the money,  wouldn't you lose about the same amount (within a few %) of money even with the 10% penalty? Idk, I've read a lot on here about trading in IRAs is stupid because you can't touch the money until 59, but really its just the 10% penalty.  Wondering if there's work arounds..

The analysts recommendations are insanely biased towards SNOW since the IPO was issued using Investment Banks (IB) .SNOW is projected to have $500 million in revenue at the end of this fiscal year and its its value is $90 Billion. While PLTR has a $1B revenue with a valuation less than $42B, yet SNOW gets a Buy recommendation and PLTR gets a bearish outlook. These IB folks are manipulating the stocks.

When the option expires, the share price minus the strike price will give you an exact value of the option.  Before that time, the option may not be worth anything on its own, because it is out of the money, but the option will have value depending on its chance of getting in the money.  The closer the stock is to being in the money, the more time left till the option expires, and the volatility of the stock (how many shares are exchanging hands or if there is big news on a certain date that could move the price and probably some other factors) all mean that the stock has a better of chance of moving into the money, so these things will usually raise the value of the option.
1000 in a yea is wayyyy bullish but I think 200 end of 2021 is definitely a good possibility and 3 or 400 by 2022. Could reach Tesla levels sooner than people realize
meh, that's pretty small loss. You will learn.
I'm talking about the debt you carry, not your stocks. People who talk about money like you do usually say things like "interest is so low, I'd be stupid not to finance that." I think they call it nouveau riche, forgive the spelling, it means newly rich. It's when you think things like districts are really important so you not only pay the big ticket to get in, but then also have to show all the other people with money that you actually have money (and more than them), without having the patience to wait and buy with cash. Couple that with spouse with a shopping problem and you'll find that life in the nice houses is not always what it seems.

I don‚Äôt have a net short position on them, nor am I that fucking retarded based on bond rates and expectations of rates. If bonds get to 10yr 1.06 by 12/17 or 1.10 by 12/20, I will consider opening up a large short position on any cyclical you want to point at. Until then, SPCE should do well/decent. I was merely attempting to answer the question in discussion as to why someone would open a short position agains SPCE. My current short positions are against RY, MPW, CRS, UUP, VXX(bought puts as leverage against stocks I bought a while ago and lost 10% on to date). All of my puts are leverage, and all my shorts positions are leveraged with calls until VIX drops below 15.

One thing I don't understand - what does smartmoney see that we don't see that makes them want to short? Or why can't they stumble across WBS's GME DD's and see this... what's WSB missing hear...?

Also, how can anyone predict how much a short squeeze will go? It could just like 1.2x and fizzle right? as paper hands sell into short cover-ers? (don't worry, i set my sell limit at $160 doe)

It's all pump and dump tactics with GME though. The short squeeze thesis is laughable
I can't believe u/Weird-Lie-3228 has flipped out about people shorting NIO no less than 3 times in the past 15 minutes, 1 of them was specifically not shorting NIO, which he commented and realized his mistake, and then he proceeded to launch into an identical spiel about someone else who was also specifically not shorting NIO in the exact same comment thread a few minutes later.

Seeing NIO and Put in the same sentence should not trigger your autism enough to make you unable to read multiple times.
Well somebody pulled out $7 billion from vanguards S&P ETF aftermarket on friday which is 4% of the whole fund. So I think you're pretty damn fuckin safe on the spy puts.

Just because they‚Äôre taxing it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre cracking down on it. In fact, it kind of means the opposite, since they likely want money.

Yes, albeit a very small one better suited for r/smallstreetbets.
at what price? they around 10 a pop atm
Honestly as long as your capable of choosing realistic strike prices and dates that shit is irrelevant
The "threat" of delisting. It hasnt happened, most likely wont happen, but theres a very very slim possiblity it does. And on top of that, theres a chance people have been scared off of NIO, at least temporarily due to misunderstanding.

I‚Äôm down to compare based on balance owed. I‚Äôve paid a decent amount on my house and paid an even larger portion towards my down payment. I am 80% cash, 10% stock, and 10% options on a 6:4 ratio. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm perfectly levered to take advantage of volatility, while mitigating losses in case of a stagnant market(too much vaccine news and bond markets have been spikey). If you think 80% cash is too levered you should try talking to any investor. They would all say I‚Äôm too liquid until you tell them my plan of exercising options after markets on days with huge runs and selling in premarket around 2:30 am et when markets are highest(after large jumps and only on Webull or schwab, TD does it but I use TD as a savings account and for TorS).

Correct. Have a loook at Sea Ltd (ticker: SE).

Need a company that‚Äôs able to grow rapidly in the near term tho, not some old boomer company
The shorter the DTE the higher the theta so you can use that as a tool to help you decide. 

Also remember you can just buy back the short at any time, so if it gets in the money you'd be taking some loss, but OTM you'll have some profits

Chinese EV bitch - get in, get what you need, GTFO.
The thing ppl are ignoring is that PLTR did not use investment banks for the IPO. The IB cartel is pissed and are taking revenge by providing bearish outlook when the company is projecting a $1 Billion revenue at the end of the fiscal year. Look at $SNOW fundamentals and you will see the difference in treatment.
Dope I love the charts on them and thought between QCLN which has Nio/clean energy and arkk/arkg/ARKF and adding xpeng maybe some Pltr it‚Äôs all I need to be set for life selling puts. Thinking of selling my condo in San Diego I‚Äôve had since 08 and traveling the country
Was my first trade, to be perfectly transparent lol. Didn't profit a whole lot, but was able to cover the $22 PLTR put I had and have some change afterwards for more trades to come.
God I hope so
Quick! Buy some TSLA and show her so she will feel stupid every time she hears the name!
I'm selling puts, cause I agree, it will bounce back up immediately after touching 3x. Assignment wouldnt be bad either.
Guys. I have a 100 shares of PLTR, GME and NIO that I would like to keep. So how do I choose strike and DTE when I sell calls to collect premium? I dont want the shares to get called away. Or should I just leave them in my account as buy and hold? Until now I just bought calls/puts and got rekt fighting the FED.

I‚Äôm surprised by how uninspired your portfolio is. Like, there‚Äôs no theme, I don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôll be able to contribute much to ‚Äúclass discussions‚Äù, sorry.

You got more balls then me man in my mind it‚Äôs like 30% chance it even touches that again and you‚Äôd have to exercise it so damn fast before it shoots up from everyone buying at that level
If they're weeklies why not just go a bit further otm with more contracts? If your wrong, it'll be hard to salvage anyway. If you're right...well who doesn't like 500%? I remember hitting a spy weekly put, once. And it was a lousy hedge, might as well have been an accident.

He knowingly slighted you. He is supposed to inform you on any changes like that. You had only agreed to the deal with insurance. If they don't cover it you need to make a new deal. He can't just go on with a different plan.

Tell him, ah shit thats really unfortunate for you that the insurance isn't covering it. I'd phone them up and get that figured out soon because I need my car back.

I'm not sold on this one to be honest, how is this different from Habbo Hotel? Habbo was huge 10 years ago and it's a pretty similar concept/platform, except there's a legitimate revenue stream for content creators. Habbo's in a recession at this point, and in my experience once a certain player set grows out of a game, a newer generation rarely jumps onto the same game.

I understand your logic but I also see the orders whenever it gets near 40. Institutions are insta buying at that level and every ‚Äútrader‚Äù thinks they are gunna snag it at 40 because their favorite YouTube investor told them to do it. Meanwhile plenty of people are happy to buy back in now since the waters safe and they are good with making 3x gains minimum in a year from current level. More people are long on it than short

I disagree.  More capital results in greater returns which allows you to dial back risk.    Taking money out of your account is like removing pieces from your side of the chess board so they can't get captured.

That being said, everyone has a different strategy and if it works for you, that's awesome.
Take a break, think of it like a circuit breaker for yourself, after a sufficient time, maybe paper trade; do not fomo, you'll get fucked

Well, this comparison doesn't make sense.  EuroNext is the largest in Europe and has physical buildings in 5 or so countries.  It is a pan European exchange. Not every country has it's own exchange.  It doesn't work that way.  Frankfurt is almost as large as AAPL on its own but Germany has several other exchanges and a lot of the German stocks are listed in EuroNext but not necessarily on a German exchange.

Not sure it'll go higher than it's ever been, but just recently it was at $123 and Christmas is going to moonshot sales befowe their earnings in February.  Premiums are low. If it gets anywhere near $120 again I'm still good to go.

With that said, if you haven't been around too long do you're own DD and maybe be conservative.

Lol the reference to where I used to live is a reference to your point. If you own a house, have been house shopping, or even looked at houses where the minimum value of a house or townhome in the district is near $1m you will realize that there is a point in saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from this district.‚Äù ^2 Again back to MY point of wealth, try to expand your view to that of someone much richer than yourself and you will understand how corporations can take advantage of taxpayer dollars to make millions or billions while generating no or negative cash flow.       

Edit: obligatory part 2 since you keep on trying to go off subject in attempt to derail the original conversation.

I wouldn‚Äôt buy NIO puts honestly homie that was a move last week. There‚Äôs a shitload of people hoping to buy it at 40 because it‚Äôs common knowledge now that the stock has a huge future. Institutions instant buy it at any point under 40 or 41. The fakeout is over now and people know it‚Äôs not going to be delisted and it should be at 60 right now. You do the math homie, I‚Äôm thinking 70 is a conservative estimate for NIO day and a lot of successful traders I know really believe NIO will hit 100 in February

Funny, I make a remark about everything you try to point out, then you call it ‚Äúdesperately trying to prove something‚Äù when I‚Äôm simply answering questions.      

Actually if you look through my post history as I‚Äôd recommend to others you would actually find a gold mine of information and current plays, all of which you‚Äôre likely too retarded to actually understand.           

‚ÄúI feel more confident in how stupid you are than the fact that I own my own house‚Äù is me trying to show you how dumb you are with your little tidbit points where you are desperately trying to find a hole but failing. I own a house and I am confident that you are dumb as hell.        

ROFL grammar Nazi trying to act as if writing on Reddit or social media is how one actually communicates in a professional setting. I can bet you I went to the school because I was on their tennis team and a 2x state champ(3 time as a team). When you start trying to use grammar as a point of intelligence you‚Äôve lost, especially when you‚Äôre talking on a sub about trading stocks(money is the only thing people care about). One of the kids that worked for me had awesome grammar, but he was a high school drop out and an aspiring author. Unfortunately for him, he only made $2 more than minimum wage because that was all his time was worth to me before he got fired for walking into the liquor store at 5am.

Predictions for Air BnB IPO?
For those who didn‚Äôt see, Atlantic Equities from London initiated coverage on Airbnb with a **$75 price target**: https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/buy-airbnb-shares-when-they-list-next-week-analyst-says-51606924737

Getting a jump on the competition, Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell picked up coverage of Airbnb with an **Overweight rating and $75 price target**, a week before the stock even begins trading.

At the top of the range, the company would have a valuation of close to $35 billion. And **at Cordwell‚Äôs target price, the valuation would top $50 billion**. He sees a company with the potential to take **a considerable piece of a very large market.**

He said the timing of the IPO is excellent, given that Airbnb will benefit as travel demand recovers in 2021, and that **margins will gain** from efforts to control costs imposed as a result of the pandemic.
He mentioned earlier that he had purchased 30 contracts. Screenshot says he's holding 20. Looks like he sold a third of the position and used the proceeds to open other positions back in March.
that was disappointing

Great job on this man! Couple of questions , I'm quite new to all this so never really seen an 'short squeeze'. 

If it was to happen, would it be a sharp spike over a few hours or a gradual increase over days?

Would the squeeze happen pre or post- Q4 earnings next year (if holding shares, would it be better to sell pre-Q4 earnings or after)

And this is all speculative, but based on your research, what price do you see GME hitting during the squeeze? I've seen some crazy numbers like $100/share being thrown around but that still seems mental to me.

Some things never change, time goes on but bears are still in shambles
NIO is already a meme, wait for a pullback
my dad has boobs and likes IPA so this fact checks out

Airbnb had to back down on diversifying their service, they wanted to go in the hotel and transporting services but they lost HALF of their Valorisation so decided to come back to their initial strategy of particular renting and now this IPO,

I think comment sections on porn videos exist solely for shits and giggles.
check out June McD $300 calls.  if McD goes to 300$ by then it could be like 15k a call profit.
Why does this comment even exist, and how can one even comprehend coming up with such a comment. And what a crazy world we live in, where this is even a possible thought. This universe must be truly random for this occurence of words to have been generated.

For those who didn‚Äôt see, Atlantic Equities from London initiated coverage on Airbnb with a **$75 price target**: https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/buy-airbnb-shares-when-they-list-next-week-analyst-says-51606924737

Getting a jump on the competition, Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell picked up coverage of Airbnb with an **Overweight rating and $75 price target**, a week before the stock even begins trading.

At the top of the range, the company would have a valuation of close to $35 billion. And **at Cordwell‚Äôs target price, the valuation would top $50 billion**. He sees a company with the potential to take a considerable piece of a very large market.

He said the **timing of the IPO is excellent**, given that Airbnb will benefit as travel demand recovers in 2021, and that margins will gain from efforts to control costs imposed as a result of the pandemic.
They‚Äôre tropical and citrusy and delicious. Quite different from the IPAs you‚Äôve probably had.

I‚Äôm going in super hard on this one. They‚Äôve got great management and have gained market share during the pandemic.

Hotels are getting ripped apart hard during the pandemic and more people than ever depend on Airbnb to pay their mortgage so there is no more political will to crack down on it. They made agreements with most major cities at this point.

Before the pandemic, old boomers used to think staying in a hotel was safer than staying in a ‚Äústranger‚Äôs‚Äù house.

After the pandemic, old boomers realize staying in an Airbnb is safer than staying in a hotel with a shared lobby, buffet breakfasts, shared pool, etc. They are literally scared for their lives at hotels.
He‚Äôs going to be mad af and probably call the cops or something but tell them to get fucked too, the car is your property. I bet he doesn‚Äôt do unapproved repairs again lol. What an idiot.

You are clearly upset and desperately trying to prove something. I fell asleep while you were writing that...or while you were reading through my entire posting history looking for what?

Oh yeah, that's from you reading my other posts.  You make large, unsubstantiated leaps in logic.  Your grammar is atrocious - retard. "Google this affluent place, that's where I say I'm from." No, you are not.  Affluent school districts produce better writers. Show me the lien release from your mortgage or you don't really own anything, bitch. Write back when you wake up princess.

Hmmm. How much money would you need to respect women?
I worked at a dealer as a service advisor, insurance work can be a real pain in the ass depending on the company and there is a LOT of phone back and forth.  Here are the steps:

\#1 Inspect the damage, perform diagnosis and recommend repairs.

\#2 Quote parts and labor and submit claim to the insurance company.

\#3 Depending on the cost of the repair the insurance company may send an inspector to verify the claim.

\#4 The claim is adjusted/approved/rejected in part or whole based on the policy and for each line item.

\#5 Any repairs not approved by the insurance company must be paid by the customer.  The advisor **must contact the customer and get approval** before ordering parts or performing work that would be billed to them.

\#6 Parts are ordered and work begins.  Repairs are verified and documented before invoicing the customer/insurance company.  


Bottom line:  Did you sign a piece of paper with an estimate on it?  If so, you're likely fucked, pay up.  If the answer is no then tell him to fucking pound sand and figure it out his own damn self; he's trying to cover his loss for doing unapproved work.  Fuck it, call the cops on him even.  They **HAVE TO** get approval.

I yolo‚Äôd 12/24 245 puts last week when the stock was at 295 and proceeded to get cleaned out.  If it goes sub 300 even after lockup ends I‚Äôll be surprised.  I‚Äôm holding on to a theta dream that I could get my money back.

Only hope is I know SWEs are greedy AF, all live in high COL areas, and sell their shares immediately, and they know the company is not worth this much.  But the institutions are gonna buy everything up and HOLD.  fucking boomers and their trillions think is some golden company when it‚Äôs a dime a dozen 

Snowflake employees are lucky AF
still easy to change it to something fucked i think

Seems like it went up last month quite a lot. 3 month chart shows only 18% growth so I am not sure what happened last month but yes you could be right. 8$ swing on this stock could be a stretch with the year end and everyone pulling money out for christmas

I mean it did go up by 20$ (~21%) last month. It is only 8$ away from 130$ (7%) approx and we got 3 weeks left. Stretch yeah prolly but chance of hitting it? Also yes. I mean its not 100% safe bet

This this mechanic was referred to me by the insurance company(that‚Äôs why I assumed it was approved.) The manager said he never had this happen before. I am assuming since he probably gets so many of their cars coming through, he just got lazy and didn‚Äôt call the insurance company
Baby, I‚Äôm back! üòÇü§£üòÇüòÖ
No, that‚Äôs why you have insurance. You tell him to contact the insurance company for additional payment if he required it. He can‚Äôt do additional work that wasn‚Äôt requested by you and then demand payment.
don't you need gold for options?
SPY needs a retrace to 366 ish to test new support before 380 IMO
Mind what those cougars teach you and you will be a sex god at 18
The way it's supposed to go is you get the estimate from the insurance, you can take that to your choice of mechanic, but they are supposed to contact the insurance if they believe it will go over estimate to get approval. I don't know what you do now, but this is why it's important to have a good mechanic.
i mean it's not nearly as annoying as two weeks ago but literally every other post was something about that company and as someone who doesn't have or want a position in it, i dont want to read that a million times over
That's what she said

Most noobs start off daytrading. It‚Äôs the style of trading that‚Äôs most beneficial for your brokerage. It‚Äôs also what people think of when they think of trading.

Buying a good stock at a good price and holding it just isn‚Äôt as exciting.

But when you daytrade you‚Äôre going up against computers. Algos that can do anything you do but better, faster, with no emotion.

It‚Äôs why 95% of Human day traders underperform the SPY

$8 swing in a month at year end feels a bit of a stretch no? I would prefer not to have it assigned. How should I read into the IV here, the 10 day historical vol currently is around 34.5, IV on the 130c 12/31 for instance is 29.3, makes it risky?  Really just looking for some gas money. To answer your question, not this is not my only holding.
His own fault for fixing the car without even running the damages by you.
As a man in his 30s here is some advice - you really don‚Äôt want to play the single game too long if you eventually want a partner.  Some of my friends played it too long and it‚Äôs killed them.  Stuck dating weirdos or nobody at all.  People will start to question you as a person.  Younger women will be interested but they will always prefer someone their own age.  It‚Äôs just a mess.

27-28 is the max max cutoff, after that it starts to get really hairy.  And I live in a major city, I can‚Äôt imagine how it is in a rural area.

Well, at my job in IT we used Mattermost for a while, which is similar but free. Other companies use rocket chat, which is also free and basically a clone from what I heard. Then later on we started migrating to Teams because it came with our license, which almost all big companies have anyway, it has good integration, and on top of it you get video calls as well. We got 5k+ employees btw. I agree Teams makes a lot more sense than slack, which is just a paid chat client with gifs.

Now it is true we also use Salesforce, so perhaps at some point slack will be used, but for now I wonder why we would if Teams is already part of a license we will definitely not give up. And for companies that use Google instead of MS the same thing will apply but with Meet, although I don't know how well that works as I have no experience with it.

Anyway, even if Salesforce bundles their chat client and manages to get some companies on board, I wonder if it was really worth the 27 billion they paid for it. Luckily they are loaded, but to me it seems like a bad deal.
Weird comment. Every country wants to retain domestic ownership of its tech/IP champions.

It's crazy that we haven't even seen the beginning of the salt. I was looking at possible theta plays on PLTR and it still looks like it has sell pressure. We could be seeing December and January calls expire worthless.
Or switch to another broker has better market hours for free. Td is 7am to 8pm. Not sure of the other broker hours but some are even better starting at 6am. 

Unless your using it to cover margin interest than it‚Äôs not terrible

Edited because Td starts pm at 7am not 4am
Alright thanks. Not quite there yet.

What color are his balls?
Long story short I took my car to a mechanic after my accident and gave him the forms the insurance gave me(the estimate). He said it would be done in a week. The day that the car is done. He calls and says that he just got off the phone with the insurance and they didn‚Äôt approve the job. Long story short he says I owe him $4500üòë. The original estimate says $2700(he said he found additional damage). Should I offer him $3000? We never discussed a price before It was finished because we both assumed the insurance would pay for it. Like who the hell repairs a car without knowing how they‚Äôre going to get paid? Like he shoulda called insurance people before he worked on the car. What should I do? The car isn‚Äôt even worth $4500....

Plenty are on Gartner report who make up a tiny share of the market. Crowdstrike is a huge growth company whereas BB is thought of as an extreme legacy company. Cybersecurity tech evolves incredibly quickly which is why you see the pure cyber companies like Crowdstrike gaining share. They‚Äôre up on the newest tech immediately. Not to mention they have top tier salespeople. Not sure about BB but I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a very shit crew. Likely they rely on systems integrators like IBM and DXC to bring them in. Trust me man, I NEVER hear about these guys when talking endpoint security

This is why Tesla are fucked long term. Norway is the warning of what's to come.

Tesla are currently valued as though they will dominate battery tech, AI, and the EV market in the future. It's not going to happen so where are the gains to be made in Tesla when all those what if scenarios are priced in already?!

I love animals and hate how some scum treat them. My temper would have probably gotten the best of me already and i would have to been at their doorstep. Problem is as others said below, a complaint to animal control may not end well. Personally though I‚Äôd take the chance of the dogs being taken away and readopted by someone who wants to give them a decent life and treat them with basic compassion. Kudos to you for being aware, man. I hope you see a sea of green this week!

It doesn't have to fail to be way overpriced.

Everyone is assuming Tesla will be the dominating EV car forever. I don't get how that would be the case. First of all, nobody buys a car from a stat sheet. Second of all, other car manufacturers will catch up.

Look where AMD was just 5 years with their CPUs and where they are now compared to intel. Things can change quickly. There are car brands out there with way more money than tesla (looking at volkswagen group)
Finally new lockdowns. Amazon, fedex (maybe), zoom etc to the MOooOoooOoN
Seriously though, do you know anyone who offers that kind of leverage to internet nobodies to gamble on options?
The c means a call.  If it were $40p, it would be a put with a $40 strike price
What strikes are you looking at?
You are buying the right to buy 100 shares of a stock for a set price anytime up until a certain date. That contract is worth money. That price in this instance was 23 cents per share in 100 share groups. So 23 each contract. That's what op bought and is now worth this large sum

This is not good discipline. This is gambling. Any smart trader would have sold a lot earlier in case of a crash. Discipline would be selling a whole lot earlier to not risk losing your money even if you think you can make more.
Positions?????
You can make money on calls that never get in the money.  Lets say that you bought calls with a strike of 20 and the stock is worth 15.  The next day it goes up to 18 and you sell it for more than you bought it for because it is coming closer to being in the money in a short amount of time.  The next week the stock tanks down to 10 and stays there till expiration, but you don't care because you already sold your calls for a profit.  I know it can be confusing at first.
What are the odds the big bois hold their shorts pass the spike if the positive catalyst is temporary. I personally only think that the big spike comes when the direction of the company changes not due to smth like PS5 induced earnings

That's because volatility for AMRN is 100%+. 

The closest I can find would be BA (currently at $230 which is what TSLA was at the time), a Jan 2022 $560C is $4.30, but BA has around 50% volatility, which is still pretty high compared to normal (TSLA probably had 30% or lower at the time). 

I'd imagine a $680C would be closer to $2 for BA, but if you push it to a July 2022, then maybe it'd be like $2.50. 

Keep in mind that Volatility affects pricing more than theta.
holy fuck but positions or ban

right now nkla 1/20/22 $60 calls are a little over $3

so we're talking about a shittier company that has never actually made a car, further from the strike price percentage-wise, a few months closer to expiry, and whose stock is about 1/10 of what tsla was at the time OP bought this, and they're trading for about 3x what OP paid. apparently OP's trade was real though, so really this just illustrates how overpriced options are in general right now.

He should sell these now because most likely they will continue to drop in price due to theta (aka time)  decay as we get closer to 1/15/21

He would collect the premium from selling the shares as well as profit from the rise of the stock itself up to and including his strike price. He only loses profit of the underlying above the strike price.

So if he‚Äôs theta gang what does he do? Turn around and sell cash secured puts to collect those premiums as if he still owned the stock, and at the next smartly timed pullback he gets assigned and starts selling those covered calls again.

Basically a guy in 1935 named Elliot noticed stocks go up and down and decided to put numbers on a chart anywhere he saw a peak or dip. Now he‚Äôs remembered for all of history as a genius.

You want a lotto ticket?  NOK 2023 calls are .33 for $7 strike.  Buy 20-30 contracts for $600-1000.  If NOK goes to like $12, you'll make $10,000-$15,000 alone in intrinsic value, every dollar higher is bonus. That is 10-15x or beyond.    

The world is rejecting China and huawei. Nokia and ericsson are basically the two only other major players for 5G that can replace huawei.  Nokia has a shitload of issues/problems that need to be fixed, but it is a target for recovery. Again, this is a pure lotto ticket.  Go in expecting to lose it all. At least you get a tax deduction in 2023.  The upside is big though.

The best part about playing SPACs is that you limit your losses because they all have a redemption value of $10. This is especially amazing right now when there might be a rug pull on the horizon. My thicc shares are only 10% away from redemption value but have 50%+ upside.

even that one, jan 2022 call 35c is .3 each. that's 600% above strike price and it still costs that much. if we applied that to 2019 TSLA that would be equivalent for a 1050c costing $9.00. but instead a 690c costing $1.

I was thinking about this on friday after i took out a small hedge on spy because my portfolio is so delta positive i am dangerously leveraged long. Timing puts is tough and long dated hedges tend to just bleed money if the market is in a consistent trend higher. Now, I understand the point of a hedge is like buying an insurance policy, but lost money is lost money. Adding to that, if i have calls i may see consistent small profits each day or fluctuation in an uptrend, and if i feel the position is not working out or my opinion has changed ‚Äî i can usually get out of it for a loss, but still get some of that capital back. 

Down moves tend to be more violent so to capitalize the most you needed to already be in the puts ‚Äî which is having the perfect timing ‚Äî and we all know that is mostly luck. So the difference between those situations is calls make it easier for me to make a decision and get out of the position for less than total loss (usually) where as betting to the downside i am more than likely going to hold that position because it ‚Äúcould be the day we have a pullback‚Äù and just watch that money vaporize each day. It‚Äôs tough, and all timing, but i just feel like i can manage better being bullish.

National socialism was a losing mentality so it all worked out for Germany in the end by them losing WW2 both socially and economically in the long run.  Happy for them.  Was actually able to get Austrian citizenship 20 years ago because Austrian government felt bad about things they did to my family 80 years ago and so that was their gesture of saying sorry to me and my family.  That‚Äôs cool about the ice ages though‚Äîsounds like a natural thing! Perhaps we have a more arrogant perception about our ability to control nature than we think.

Hmm so how many stocks do u own in Tesla?
He *can* (not has to) buy 2000 shares of TSLA from the suckers he sold the contract to, for $135 per share (strike price he put on the contract)

Which are currently worth $600 per share

So he paid $460 for the ability to pay $250K to purchase $1.2M worth of TSLA stock

Was wanting to get DKNG LEAPS but the premium seems fucking absurd right now
Thanks
yeah, that is the risk of selling covered calls.

You can lose out on the gain as the person who you sold the contract to will win what you lose.

&#x200B;

It's the other end of FDs.

If you sell covered calls, you usually want to sell to the amount you don't think it will pass. in that time.

&#x200B;

For example. If I think PLTR won't hit 40 by the end of the week.

I could sell a call for 12/11 $40C.

If it doesnt get there, then I keep the premium. If it does or pass it, the person buying it can exercise the contract buying  your shares at 40$ each. So you still make a profit, but not as much as the guy buying the ~~FD~~  contract.

&#x200B;

Risk vs Reward. As a seller of the contract, you're the house in a casino.  you might not win big, but you rarely will ever lose.

Sounds like you haven't been trading for very long or weren't even looking at TSLA options at the time. TSLA in mid 2019 wasn't making a profit and hadn't been for a while, and by mid July 2019, it was down ~35% YTD, dropping from $350 to $230.

With falling shares and bleak outlook, TSLA had low volatility, and while not as low as SPY like you said, a 200 fucking percent OTM leap is sure as fuck ain't going to go for much. That example I used for SPY was only 50% OTM. 

Don't fucking matter what you think, that screenshot is the actual price at that date, check it for yourself on TOS, you don't have to believe me. 

If you really want to do the math yourself, learn some financial mathematics, and plug the numbers into a Black Scholes model and see for yourself. At the end of the day, those numbers are legit, whether OP actually owns these contracts or not.

The thing is is in your late twenties as a guy you're pretty much moving into the money. Delta starts ripping. 

But as you hit your 30s. Theta start kicking up noticeably. Things start taking more maintenance to do that you didn't have to worry about before. Hairline starts moving places that might not be optimal.

Then as you get older, you've got the capital you can deploy, but the market kind of sucks there aren't a lot of good options. Mostly just stuff with crazy high IV.

If you do call debit spreads theta actually becomes somewhat irrelevant until the very end, in which case theta burn helps you if you‚Äôre up (hurts you if you‚Äôre down though). Also, IV crush is nonexistent. The ‚Äúcatch‚Äù is that your gains are capped.

I'm not complaining as I've secured my seat in the world of high finance, my exit opportunities will be endles after a couple years and my hours are pretty good in terms of Investment Banking (i'm talking 9-5 good), however i've yet to come across this gruelling modelling and pitch book work that a lot of fellow IBers here talk about.

So far my role has consisted of:

‚Ä¢ Oversight of the full trade life cycle through to settlement

‚Ä¢ Cash reconciliation on all accounts and provision of funding for daily investment activity

‚Ä¢ Resolve queries and issues emanating from custodians and counterparties

‚Ä¢ Ensuring integrity of static data and account onboarding

‚Ä¢ Daily unit pricing checks & trade reconciliation

‚Ä¢ Derivatives trade bookings and managing daily collateral

Can anyone let me know when the "modelling" and "client interactions start", I guess I have to put in my hours of doing the "grunt work".

Who did you jerk and whose cum is on you?
There‚Äôs a couple different ways of trading options. On one hand, you could trade options hoping that the value of your contract increases, in which you sell it for a profit before expiration. Other investors use options either as a hedge or a way to acquire shares at a discount at a certain point in time, which is when they would exercise their call. The only traders who should be exercising options are the ones who can afford it without margin.

EDIT: All options either get exercised eventually by someone or expire worthless

Becky portfolios are a license to print money the vast majority of the time, named as such because they make products for predominantly white upper-middle to upper class chicks. Lots of people have made fat fucking stacks off of ULTA.  

Idk if I'd have 50% of my portfolio in lulu but seriously, it's not a bad play and is far from stupid. Not nearly as stupid as the CLF 12/4 13c I held instead of selling for 2$ before it expired.
If you got advice from wsb on how to trade it's a good sign you're going to lose your money.

I'd like to know your thoughts about SPWH as a deep value play. It seems like a pretty good deal right now. It used to be  a major holding of Michael Burry, but I noticed he sold out last quarter. All of the standard valuation metrics are way below the sector averages, and they reported pretty decent earnings this quarter, including a 200% increase in online sales, but the share price dropped off significantly afterward. What gives? 

I can only guess investors may be abandoning the company because the bulk of their sales are firearms, and they fear increased regulation.

Best Buy was amazing mid to late 90s.  They used to have these warehouse style shelves packed to the top with videocards.  A whole aisle both sides.  Another aisle of hard drives and soundcards.  Lots of volume on a decent amount of selection. 

I'm guessing that's actually why Walmart stopped selling hardware.  But Walmart was screwy because they were always late to the punch on new hardware and charged release prices for months well after the next generation was out.  In some cases they had old videocards and the sort that was YEARS old and still at release price.  They didn't care.

I stopped going to Bestbuy after their prices started to get non competitive too and I could just order on Newegg (Since BB was an hour and a half roundtrip drive).  Back when Newegg was amazing.  I'd still like a local store that sells hardware though.  Esp if their prices are reasonably close to what I can find online.

All you have to do to understand EVs is drive one for a bit, and even better, own one. The powertrain just makes way more sense. I‚Äôve owned one for over 3 years and have paid $0 in maintenance besides windshield washer fluid. You don‚Äôt even need brake pads nearly as often because bc of regen braking. Cost of electricity where I‚Äôm at makes the fuel cost 25% of the cost per mile when compared to gas. 

To quote Joe Rogan (yeah I hate myself for saying that too), EVs makes other cars feel stupid. He refers to his Tesla but I feel that about any EV. Eventually, range anxiety will be a thing of the past.

SNAP seems like one of those companies you look back on in 10 years when its 5000% higher and wonder how you didnt grab a piece  and hold on. It's a CIA special (logo is a fucking spook) and therefore in a protected class because it's used for data mining and profiling by the intelligence communities. Literally can't go tits up.

Unless the future of the company is to absorb literally every single car bought and sold in the US and every single solar system installation in the US this quarter, a $567B valuation is completely off the rails. I'm honestly interested in your bull case? Is Tesla going to be the world's only vehicle manufacturer? The only solar provider?

The entire remainder of your post is essentially to keep buying lottos until one of them returns the fund. Survivor bias is strong in here. Shit, the dude could have had March 2020 expiries and would have been totally fucked. The Fed could have failed to implement their programs, and Congress could have failed to pass stimulus like in 2008. The idea that a luxury car manufacturer would see its share price go up 400% in eight months during the worst economic crisis in history is insane on its face.

So you expecting a 4% increase in same store sales vs q4‚Äô19 during a pandemic with many closed locations vs ‚Äô19  when trend is close to 40% decrease. I can get behind the e-commerce growth but think their will be decrease in store sales... think your total revenue is $1b too strong. Profit margin is getting worse with waaay more console sales vs ‚Äò19. And e-commerce fulfillment is expensive - 20% would be great with product sales mix. I see net loss even with your e-commerce revenue growth.

Right now you‚Äôre holding a call option on yourself. So you can sell now, and catch the best female bid out there. Or you can diamond hand hoping theta doesn‚Äôt work you too hard too fast.

Big tobacco have been lowering nicotine for ages now. It makes you buy more smokes to maintain you nicotine consumption.

If you want to reduce the amount of new smokers, raise the price. The smokers will pay or go to black market but youger crowds would probably just get into the vaping scene.

For sure, I'm sure this product isn't for everyone. They've done studies that show that \~30% of smokers are interested or very interested in trying the product, and another 30% are somewhat interested in trying the product. When we're talking about 34 million smokers in the US alone, even a percent of a percent (say .25-.5%) of the market would be sufficient to drive value to the company. Let alone if legislation comes out to make it mandatory.
Let‚Äôs hope so

I laughed heartily, said "alright I think we're done here", turned around and walked out of the store grinning from ear to ear.  


EDIT: I was there for PC parts for a new build, and the employee began trying to sell me on a prebuilt. I did not find the parts I was looking for there.

Lower rates for longer (ie QE infinity) leads to higher multiples. Eventually though something shifts with the underlying psychology of market participants.

> "What is the single best business in the world?"  His answer?  "If you could own a royalty on people spending money." 

Works for the Federal Government corporation.

They get a "royalty" off my paycheck then what is left I spend on goods and services.  And they get a "royalty" off of every purchase.  Some of the remainder is invested in the stock market and in savings.  They take a "royalty" off of any gains on those.  The rest is in retirement account to which they will take a "royalty" off of as well. 

Eventually I'll spend that money, in the retirement and brokerage accounts, on other goods and services.  To which they will take yet another "royalty" on.

So the solution is simple, operate a government and scale it big and tall.  Then you can charge all kinds of royalties.

Doesn‚Äôt China have a lot of excess steel they can‚Äôt put on the market due to import bans? With a new President you don‚Äôt think those bans are likely to be lifted to make it cheaper to manufacture goods as long as your iron worker industry remains strong?      

On Monday I am likely to buy the 12/24 $15.50P and $18C as a small grouping. I plan on selling the put side or call side when the profit on calls exceed 110% of cost giving me 5% profit and a put position to use as leverage against other small cap manufacturing plays.

Ya I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll last long. Beauty of it from my perspective is, if usd goes up the value of my stocks go up relative to my home currency. If usd goes down, the price of my stocks will likely go up to match the difference and my home currency buying power goes up. It‚Äôs a net zero hedge over time but it helps smooth out up and down days for anything I own where I can see easily how much price impact currency rates have versus actual individual stock movement.

But this is one of the 3 big Japanese Banks, what makes MUFG different from MFG (Mizuho) and SMFG (Sumitomo)? Could there be structural challenges in general facing banks, or Japanese banks (negative interest rates) that might make it more compelling to look for other value plays?
By design, it's all been contained in asset prices. Let the "rich" get a head start before letting the genie out of the bottle. 2021-2030 it starts leaking into consumer goods and wages on the lower to middle tier. If not, we spiral into a deflationary depression and shit gets hella weird.

Congratulations, but you really need to sell ASAP. Is there anyone even willing to buy those options now? There is very little time value left and no volume at that low of a strike price which means you are going to have to sell your position well below the bid price just with the hope that a market maker will pick it up for their spread play. 

Don't get me wrong... I fucking wish I had those in my portfolio, but get smart and cash those contracts in while you can still find someone willing to buy them.

Option contract prices are based off of IV, implied volatility. The more volatile a stock, the more expensive options are both ways. Look at TSLA‚Äôs premiums compared to NVIDIA‚Äôs.  
I‚Äôm not an expert, but generally I look for strikes that are unlikely but not impossible, and at a price where if the call exercised I would be happy with the payout. ($10 cost per share, sell $15 CC, exercises at $17, still made $5 per share and got maybe $100 in premium. Probably $100 multiple times over several weeks before you get assigned)
Everyone expects a not so great Q3, its the addressing of Cohens letter, rebranding plans, e-commerce plans, and news about this console cycle that may swing bullish. If there are paper hands who don't pay attention to what was said and base it on strictly current numbers they might be shaken out. But I don't expect more than a 3-4% dip if any at all. They need to have plans on how they're going to carve out their slice of e-commerce and give people reasons to shop their and not utilize their Amazon Prime.
Yeah, official tallies seem to indicate that. But this doesn‚Äôt seem to resonate with the life actually lived. I spend $275 for a piece of shit Airbnb in the middle of nowhere.  Groceries are going parabolic. Housing is up. What has gone down, gasoline? Who gives a fuck about that at this time.

You're not understanding. Internet companies today are solidified as huge profit makers. Investors don't want to miss out on the next Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.. Back in the 90s nobody could say if they were going to make money; At the time it was just hype and fomo. Investors today are pumping SNOW, Tsla/NIO, or whatever bc they know these sectors are profitable

$30c $T 1/15 will print, but why not go further out a bit and more OTM? I think HBO Max will bring in anywhere between 10-25 million extra subs in the 30 days of Wonder Woman stream.  It's a matter of HBO will disclose the # of new subscribers at Wonder Woman premiere or sometime in January.  Even if people cancel their sub after the first month, that's still between 150M-375M in additional sub revenue in one month for the experiment and it's safe to assume people will continue to sub in the month their next movie is dropping on Max.  The play here is just to profit on the first pump and dump, which is Wonder Woman.

TSLA IV is way, way higher than SPY. The two are not at all comparable, even if Tesla IV has dropped considerably that summer.
I'll say the same thing here as I said in your ban message:

> How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man.

> NO POLITICS.
Quoting the PE shows you know nothing about the future of the company.

Read Anti-Fragile and The Black Swan to understand how poorly black scholes does with extremes and how the only place to profit reliably is at those extremes, which is extremely difficult to do because it implies losing small amounts consistently waiting for the big win to make up all that progress. Traders generally don‚Äôt play that way because it goes against psychology, but it does work mathematically if you find places for it to play out.

I‚Äôm trying to help you if you‚Äôre really interested in how this stuff works, it won‚Äôt ever work that well on a first play, but that is the misunderstood place that black scholes underestimates and that‚Äôs where the odds are miscalculated and ripe for taking advantage of, but it‚Äôs still a very hard and painful grind generally, considering you should lose money on almost all of your bets.

I repeat that this event, although very lucky still, was a great risk/reward play because the options market priced it so freaking terribly by seeing TSLA as a not-that-volatile stock for years due to it being rangebound, while revenue jumped 6x. It was an amazing opportunity and would have made a great play for ~5% of anyone‚Äôs portfolio, but no one should have actually expected it to happen, just to realize that it could and the potential returns made it a fantastic play.
Fuck you

Actually, you can find plenty outlets talking about these things, sans the New World Order bullshit, which is about the only thing people like Alex Jones add to any conversation. From Sandy Hook to whatever, Alex Jones takes publicly available information and injects harmful, off the wall nonsense into it. That's all he does.

He's not privy to info no one else is. He's a dude who screams into a mic about crazy stuff as part of a business model to sell things. He is a net negative contributor to sane and responsible discourse.

PLTR!
This also means in one universe that stonks only goes down instead of up
This bill passed both house and senate. Says publicly traded foreign companies need to be have their audits be shown to American regulators. Right now china doesn't allow that. If they don't comply they'll be delisted in 3 years. There'll probably be some agreement reached by then but I think it's spooking some people now since it was just passed

Yep
is that a real company? That one looks a bit too vague for my liking lol

lots of other ones are very clearly real companies with real clients and partners. Not saying they are clear winners, but they are not NKLA level frauds.

The stock rallied not because of the vaccine distribution (which is already priced in) but because some analyst released a report citing that that company would make an attracted leverage buyout candidate. CVS rallied in sympathy because its arguably the superior company and therefore if WBA is worth X, CVS is worth X+1.

The argument is the company is mismanaged and needs a private set of owners to extract its intrinsic value.

PS I bought calls last Tuesday so I'm aligned with your position

Yep. Mods need to make an exception on cap rules for SPACs.
 I used to know a guy who would do a ‚ÄúT rex routine‚Äù he called it on occasion.  All of our friends would encourage it, chanting "DOOOOO THE DINOSAUUUR, DO-THE-DINOSAURRRR". 

Then he would strip down to his boxers, feed his arms under the waistband of them and out the leg holes, and lift so he had a wedgie which resulted in each testicle hanging out the side. 

His arms would be restricted into the T-rex pose and he would chase girls around roaring.

One of the most fucked up but hilarious things I‚Äôve seen in my life. Would definitely not get away with it these days lol

Haha. I couldn‚Äôt even afford to short Tesla if I wanted too
 

I'm not complaining as I've secured my seat in the world of high finance, my exit opportunities will be endles after a couple years and my hours are pretty good in terms of IB (i'm talking 9-5 good), however i've yet to come across this gruelling modelling and pitch book work that a lot of fellow IBers here talk about.

So far my role has consisted of:

‚Ä¢ Oversight of the full trade life cycle through to settlement

‚Ä¢ Cash reconciliation on all accounts and provision of funding for daily investment activity

‚Ä¢ Resolve queries and issues emanating from custodians and counterparties

‚Ä¢ Ensuring integrity of static data and account onboarding

‚Ä¢ Daily unit pricing checks & trade reconciliation

‚Ä¢ Derivatives trade bookings and managing daily collateral

Can anyone let me know when the "modelling" and "client interactions start", I guess I have to put in my hours of doing the "grunt work".

Sell weekly covered calls?
> Eventually you‚Äôll get assigned (share price ends week above $15, and you‚Äôll have to sell 100 shares at $15 even if market is $17)
> At this point you sell CSP (Cash secured puts) because you want those shares back, collecting additional premium. Market value is now $17, you sell a put for $12.
> Repeat weekly, eventually you‚Äôll get assigned and now you

What I don't understand is how you choose the value, in your example, to sell the 100 shares for $15. Is it just arbitrary, based off feeling, or is there a way to calculate what value you should be selling your covered call at?

That's why I said that you can't be greedy and accept early loss on the CC.

I sold a $45 when it was $35. It jumped to $50. I would either sell for $45 or cover buy it to close for a loss. I thought, hell it gotta go down a bit after a $15 jump right? So i kept rolling it. It reached $70 and I was still rolling, at some point I just accepted defeat and will try to regain with some aggressive covered calls, but honestly it's hard to believe I will have any success wit the pace NET is going.

Take a look at Kamikaze Cash on YouTube, his video on the wheel strategy is excellent for learning the method.

So the cash secured puts portion of the wheel begins when your covered calls you‚Äôve been selling get exercised, which basically means you have to sell your 100 shares to the buyer at the given strike price. 

So what now? Well, you‚Äôre sitting on a pile of cash that you received from selling 100 shares of stock, so you sell OTM puts just like before with the covered calls because you want to collect the premium from the buyers. Once the puts expire worthless, you get to keep the premium, again, just like the covered calls. Eventually, your put option you sell will expire ITM so you will be assigned the 100 shares of the underlying stock. And guess what? You‚Äôre back to square one, start selling covered calls again and keep collecting that premium baby.

Once again, I highly recommend Kamikaze Cash on YouTube. He explains the thetagang strategies way better than I could, and he keeps the videos brief and to the point. Go check him out.

It's just a giant contradiction. Everything is going back to normal so retailers like JWN and M should go back to normal.

But then OSTK and W are way up because there is a new normal where people buying more things online, and that trend is here to stay.

Yeah, and it ends up being a taxable wash sale, as well as a bunch more hassle managing and tracking the wheels.

"*My portfolio is definitely >50% lulu. For older investors you may remember Chip Wilson saying that they didn't design Lululemons for fat people. While he "shouldn't have said the quiet part out loud", I agree fully as Lulu is for hot and fit women and men and continues to attract as such.* "

Yeah
Do you think that translates to their stock though in all honesty?
Just buy shares.

This is just a complicated way of doing it.

You think this fucking dude solved what the smartest traders on the planet and algos cant?

There is truth in what he is saying, but it is not going to be consistently more profitable than just buying shares of spy.

Go ahead and do it. This is wsbets not wsshares.

But its all bullshit and its all gambling.

How‚Äôd you get a job here anyway ya fuck face?
I may be a little biased since I got in the company when it was trading in the 9$ range (was anticipating the IPO for many years now, and was pleasantly surprised at the DPO announcement), but I do not think PLTR actually has any valid comps. No company does what Palantir does. Google may have the capabilities to do it, but they don't and won't (and is not a good company to compare pltr with anyways, due to entirely different products and business model).

It's important to realize that if Palantir wanted to make a lot of money in the short term, they'd do what the entirety of silicon valley has been doing since day one: sell your data to advertisers. But they choose to pursue endeavors with more social and economical impact, such as vaccine allocation distribution, and military throughput. It's also important to realize that while most tech companies seek to replace humans with machines and algorithms, Palantir's goal is to enhance human capability with tech but NOT replace humans. Humans will always be an integral part of how their software functions.

All in all, it's a fascinating company and Alex Karp is truly a genius. Gives me Gates, Musk vibes (not memeing). It's hard to say what PLTR will look like in 10 years, but I am very bullish in their vision and current product offering. If you want to just compare to snowflake, it currently generates more revenue than SNOW and at a much lower marketcap.
Why try and discredit someone who found a way to make money while being laid off? Whether you think it‚Äôs dumb or not, they made money. And if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a lot of money,they still had more money than they had. Who wouldn‚Äôt take 50k ? People never cease to amaze me

There are different ways to look at it. They profit more highly than shares when realized volatility is less than IV. But you don‚Äôt want a covered call strategy on a stock you think will go down either.  To me I‚Äôm thrilled if I can augment the performance of shares as I still own the non-expiring position and generated a little cash flow to buy more shares. And I don‚Äôt really want shares of companies unless they are long term holds. 

I think of it as selling off some potential upside in exchange for some downside protection.

My thoughts exactly. I can‚Äôt believe how many people here think you can find arbitrage across such a large class of stocks based on arbitrary metrics (like IV) as opposed to actually determining if the market has undervalued or overvalued the stock and over what tike frame a correction would occur, absent any other events.

With interest rates so low, traditional models and fundamental analysis are rather useless. If you know anything about finance, determining the value of a firm is based on discounting cashflows by the risk free rate. With interest rates so low, valuations are just through the roof across the board.

My suggestion, and what has served me well, is to look at comparables within industries. Analyze the multiples within industries, as well as the management, to determine what is overvalued and undervalued.

If you're playing short term options though, brush up on your TA.

So, so far, for evidence that this is **absolute bullshit** and you guys are all retarded for falling for shit like this all the time, is:

- The image he linked for his All timeline is missing percentages and start date. You can also see the edits he made if you look closely enough with low brightness. Fake.

**And also:**

- The $136 contracts didn't exist until September 2020. But even if you pick a similar contract that did exist such as the 15Jan21 120C they only went from $20(if bought at the bottom in 2019, split adjusted) to $500, which is a 25x return(2500%).

[He's the chart for the 140C(700 pre-split)](https://i.imgur.com/LYnMv2n.png)

[He's the chart for his imaginary 136C, they didnt even exist until September](https://imgur.com/ogsJ6PZ)

**To which OP Replied (and got downvoted for being exposed):**

**"That is because this when the stock split. A $680 call becomes 5 $136 calls on a 5 to 1 split that happened... you guessed it... in September 2020."**

**Nope.** Contracts don't stop existing after split, they split just like the stock...again you show you're a lying fgt...also split was in august not that it matters. And as I said, the numbers I gave you are split adjusted already.

Nice larping though fgt

I don‚Äôt think covered calls are free money, but I also think they are under appreciated to bring higher risk and higher IV companies into portfolios with lower risk appetites.

Covered calls on ARKK seems like a sensible investment side by side compared to outright QQQ.
Right, because all the other palantards who bought calls instead of shares at 30 really came out on top, didn't they?

Broseph keep those shares, they‚Äôre almost bragging rights at this point, that‚Äôs a huge margin of safety. Damn good plays man, I‚Äôd hold on to those. This might sound crazy but JWN has the potential to be a growth stock, theyre killing it in e-commerce, first brick and mortar retailer to have 60 percent of their revenues online.

Yeah, no.
far otm and date contracts are never cheap anymore, kinda sucks cuz people know the potential of gains.

however i was there at the time. tesla stagnated between 200-350 for YEARS. anytime it broke the 300's it would get rejected. every. single. time. people made a killing selling calls on tesla during that time period.

so given that pattern why would anyone think a 800c is remotely not flushing money down the toilet?
Yeah but no one will buy his call at 100$ strike cuz it aint hitting lmao and he‚Äôd make little to no premium at that strike
Of course you will. Thank you for your sacrifice. I'll be getting the vaccine too, but only after folks like you have tested the risk and either later developed serious CNS issues or actually come up cherries. See you on the other side of "Project Warpsped". Lol

Revenue doesn't matter, earnings matters.  Revenue is how much you get from selling goods.  You have to subtract that with cost of goods and your operating costs to get how much you actually earn.  If you get shitty earnings for years, nobody is going to want to buy your stock.
I mean they are all way under valued right now and everyone is aware they are the future now
That's the risk. At that point he would have made about $35k + $2k from the covered calls. Not bad for a week.

Edit: Also could sell calls at different strikes to further manage risk.
Love you too bro.  I've lost like 15k and still loving every day man.

this subreddit loves you back ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh I see now. So if he sold call at $100 strike and it hit, he'd still be profiting $76 x 100.
This is why OP is going to lose it all. Instead of recognizing this fact, he is going to believe he has it all figured out.
A covered call is more of a hedge against a drop than a doubling down of a stock. If you own 100 shares you can sell a covered call, basically say X is trading at 40$, you own 100 and sell a covered call for $50 expiring January 20, 2021. So if it hits $50 or higher, you sell them for $50 on day of expiration. It if goes to $49 or lower, you got the premium expense for the call as profit and keep the shares

The premium for puts isn‚Äôt worth it. Gme isn‚Äôt gonna move significantly one way or another. Option holders are the biggest losers.  Share holders will be losers too. Only pumping it up so the bigger bagholders can dump it at a higher price. There are much better stocks to be dumping money into, but you autists keep trying to push for that epic short squeeze to $50. Muahahaha
Thy will be done ü§≤
you‚Äôre selling someone the right to buy your shares at a certain price. you collect premium up front, if the stock doesn‚Äôt reach the strike price you selected [really, if it doesn‚Äôt reach the breakeven price (strike price + premium price)], then you keep the premium and your shares. only downside is if the stock blows through your strike price, you end up making less money than you would have had you held. you can always roll out the call though.

You could make 150% in less than a year being 1 year out leaps betting on the same price trajectory TQQQ would gain in 1 year.

In legal jurisdiction for a decent hoe the rate is $500
You actually make some really great points. Average daily sales of $4k definitely seems excessive, despite the high traffic and demand on the black friday weekend. That would require a sale of 57 AAA Titles per day on average... do they even carry that many in stock on the daily? I think their ecommerce share is greater than anticipated.
So strangely in this case very, very high. Options (and all chronological bets) are continuous functions so for instance buying a leap for one year is the same 50/50 bet BUT each day (so 252 days) is a new flip of the same coin and you get to count every aggregate coin flip.

So for instance if you bought a $1 leap on a company that recently had a sell-off for no reason but had strong fundamentals you'd likely win the bet, not lose it, with regression to the mean.

Stats fascinates me but basically this is far more complicated than it first appears. Your real question is: "For the duration of the contract can you actually lose n days on a row?"
Looking at Koodo pricing they seem decent. It‚Äôs good that they‚Äôve tried to reach a younger demographic through that. I‚Äôd still call them a boomer company though. That‚Äôs based on how their management operates and the business growth potential, not meant to be an insult specifically.
Surely nobody is going to buy them so his only option is exercising. I wonder how that would work for someone like me who doesn't have the money to buy the shares. Those contracts are only worth that in the market but if nobody buys them then what happens? Let's say OP doesn't have the 136k needed to buy the shares (I'm assuming he does), is there a way for him to still get the market value for these calls? Is there some entity out there that will/has to buy the calls? u/Anono-mon can you shed any light here?

Where do you think they will be in 3-5 years? Better or worse circumstances? Nordstrom just became the first department store in history to make over 60% of their revenue online, they‚Äôre becoming a strong e-commerce play. But if you want me to be frank, it always come down to greed. Most of the ‚Äúin style‚Äù stocks have been priced to the moon, if you think WSB was a stock pumping cesspool, just look at Cramer, the guy literally told every boomer to pile on to these companies and was finding creative ways to justify their valuation. What‚Äôs worse, is that he is no longer preaching that narrative, now he‚Äôs preaching ‚Äúpent up demand‚Äù play. Lol wtf

To go back to your main point, it‚Äôs indefinitely much easier and more likely to make a return on your investment if Nordstrom goes from 30 to 40, than hoping these pumped up stocks keep luring investors. Also margins of safety are key, I wouldn‚Äôt buy Tesla or PLTR today but I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy JWN. I don‚Äôt want to bash these meme stocks because I know our little family on this sub loves them, but I just need to remind them to look at the prices their buying them for. The name of the game is to buy low sell high, not high and higher. It could work and some comPanies have leaders like Tesla that find ways to make it work, but generally you want to underpay for shares.

Value investing right there. The one near me has a car line a dozen deep at the least all day long.
The OPEC & Friends supply agreement was very bullish for the industry yesterday. Oil prices also have climbed over the last week. Lastly, these are some of the (relatively) few remaining companies trading well below their February prices.

You sound like the triggered finance boomers back in June that asked why traders are bidding up the airlines.
I also have 367 for Wednesday. So maybe those will be ok.
RDSa/b is performing very well. Plus they‚Äôre increasing dividends quarterly. I have leap calls for 2022

100% absorption
100% shares. Although I was highly leveraged on the come up. Sold and took some profits, now about 25% cash. And I agree, mid-term (5 year timeframe) I think these companies will do very well. But it‚Äôs a tough call. If I sell, it would likely be to rebuy in the near future, as I‚Äôm anticipating a significant correction from the massive gains we‚Äôve seen over the past 1.5 months.

Palantir is the opportunity of the lifetime to get on the ground floor of a once in a generation stock imo. I only believe this because I'm a retard that hopefully will be autist one day.

I PLTR feel PLTR like PLTR I PLTR heard PLTR this PLTR before
I don't understand this retail run up at all. At least with PLTR or TSLA or some other meme stock the 'unknown' can trick investors into believing something that won't materialize.

But JWN hasn't increased revenue or profit in 5 years, and their stock price fell 50% because of it. Designer clothing is not the trend, beckys want to buy LULU now.

Revenue is still projected to be 20% lower next quarter even though consumer spending has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. So investors are hoping that JWN can recover to where it was in February, a dying brick-and-mortar retail chain that has been getting it's ass kicked by e-commerce and changing fashion trends for over half a decade. Can't miss an opportunity like that!
Are you holding shares? Or options? If shares just hold, If you got a good deal on them, no sense in giving your position up. I‚Äôm in the school of thought that these companies had a deep reality check about their business. whatever ideas to improve it we‚Äôre expedited during this pandemic. They should hit 2021 with the fear of god to perform. Especially Nordstrom, my boy Eric Nordstrom saw 600 million in net worth value get decimated, you best believe he‚Äôs working harder to reinstate the companies position.

LEAPS are literally never cheap anymore. you'd never be able to pay .23 on even the furthest possible OTM option 2 years out on even the lowest iv shit like MSFT.

i check periodically if i can scoop up some 1-2 years out 100%+ OTM options for pennies and they don't exist. the closest would be SPY. you can get spy 550c 1/2022 for .45, but none for single tickers (esp tech companies). But the possibility of SPY going to 550 in a year is lower than the possibility of Tesla going over 9000 post split.
No shit they are ahead. 7-10 years being priced into the stock is how I know it‚Äôs a bubble though. That‚Äôs just such an exceptionally stupid thing to believe.

Funny you say that.... that's exactly how me and my best friend used to justify bodybuilding to ourselves. We thought we were better than everyone because people treated us like gods in the gym. Then in 2019 both of us were just like whats the point bro, we can outlift everyone, bench more, have 3D deltoids and superman chest but that doesn't change the fact that we're broke as dick. We need to put bodybuilding in the rearview mirror and make money, once that happens my dream is to go back to how it used to be all those years... but this time with money to back up my body.

Please do not go all in on fds. Very real chance of getting wiped out. Im expecting a gap up weds but if it doesnt happen, fds will be dead. Majority of the position should be april
IMO it's only risky short term (until MRTP approval comes). They have a game changing product that will be out there in only a matter of time.
People on Twitter bragging about their gains from buying stocks are retarded. It‚Äôs not hard to make money on shares when the market goes up 50% in 5 months. 

People like us, on the other hand, are autists. We deserve to brag about both our gains and losses when we bet everything on FDs expiring in a week or less.
You need to consider the value of instant liquidity.  Being above to move your money around to catch stocks as they rise is better than getting stuck in a position X days until expiration that isn't moving (or worse moving down).  

I'd sell 1dte calls and that's it.  Anything longer means I lose out on higher % gains elsewhere.  But each person has their own risk/reward tolerance.   On WSB, I get these distinct feeling people aren't looking for 3% gains a week...
Can you unban H.CAC? Merger date announced on Friday. You‚Äôll have to unban it then anyways. Lots of good posts/comments being auto-erased. It went up 40% on Friday.

Also, summoning u/zjz
For long term yes...it‚Äôs on sale while the market is at and ATH.  Find the value...not bag hold at the top.
Yes because 1k / week is sustainable. 

That‚Äôs 1.9% per week. 

Compounded = 280% per year. 

Why doesn‚Äôt anyone with 50k just retire making 100k a year. 


Don‚Äôt pretend you understand risk better than us just because you poked your head into thetagang and feel like you solved the game. 

You‚Äôre just an autist like us except wit less balls for risk tolerance.
Agreed, so crazy. I mostly stick with real estate investing, but happy with the gain I‚Äôve made over the past few months.

They are 7 to 10 years ahead just because Tesla had their growing pains *years* ago when everyone thought EVs were still a waste of space.  They are also *highly* specialised.

They have a popular, refined product with the best technology available running them.  All those bigger companies will need to pivot and create a competitive product while experiencing the same pivoting pains and supplying their boomers with the gas guzzlers they still want, which will curb their ability to keep up.

Dude, this thing is such a meme it is spawning other memes. Why do you think every SPAC with a picture of an EV is running 80% each time a merger is announced? Every Tom, Dick, and Harry is chasing the next Tesla.

It is a meme because the entire automotive and solar industries in the US are $563B annually. TSLA is worth $567B now. If you think it is reasonable that this company is already worth the entire industry it operates within, the fuse of this bomb is already lit.

It only works until there's a crash. Sure if you hold through it will go back up, as you can see from its all time chart, but how long are you willing to wait, and how slow will growth be if we do crash before it's able to consecutively have green days and return to it's value

Unless he bought them for cheap, owning 6,000 shares of PLTR would be over 100k. 1.2k over 50 weeks would be like 60k. 60% return is pretty fucking good.

If I had that much money to throw around, I‚Äôd probably use 20% for Hail Mary options (BB, GME etc) just in case. 20k could make you a millionaire with some of the WSB yolos

That probably was a short squeeze, at least in part. People have been opening new short positions at higher and higher dollar amounts this whole time. You need a really high bump in price in a really short time to get people to really panic and close their short positions.

Basically he bought a contract that says he is allowed to buy Tesla stock anytime from when he purchased the contract, to Jan 15th of 2021 at a price of 136 dollars per share, no matter what the current price of tesla is. 1 contract is for 100 shares and he bought 20 of them. You can likely see why buying 2000 tesla shares at 136 bucks when they are currently going for 600 would be a nice come up.

Management basically has to talk about q4 (the main part of this post)  give guidance, talk about the success of their strategic plan. Not doing so would risk their jobs with cohen on the hunt.

Its possible something happens to drop the price. But im expecting a gap up from the call
Retail accounts for 22 percent of all call volume across the market. This stands to reason the retail call volume in WSB meme stocks is much higher than 22 percent obviously. Then if you realize that options being purchased are up 80 percent year over year, and options are leveraged bets that can lead to gamma squeezes that force dealers to buy the stock up, then yes, with a little bit of research I don‚Äôt just believe retail is moving stocks like nio up, I know it to be a fact.

There's quite alot of competitors out here but only a few enables you to trade options. My company actually reviews brokerage throughout Hong Kong, you can find the list here: 

[https://www.planto.hk/en/blog/US-Stock-Account-Compare/](https://www.planto.hk/en/blog/US-Stock-Account-Compare/)  


Naturally you can trade in banks like HSBC but the fees are uber high, think 20 USD per trade execution and they have a horrible user interface. TDA and Interactive Brokers have been in HK for a very long time, and had a relatively lower fee but transferring money in is a pain in the ass and they used to have a minimum balance of 20k USD and have inactivity fees so we never suggested them. Looks like they're changing though, with increase competition, they've started removing minimum balances, making transfer more seamless and removing trading fees.  


I can't speak for Mainland China though but I believe TDA and IB exist there. I heard opening an account is hard though since China is very strict about money being transferred out of China.
that's unfortunate.  it's actually a really interesting piece that covers a little bit of history of tontines.
The number of posts and comments about this stock should tell everyone that this shit is gonna tank hard. 

If you actually believe in the company, buy June 2021 or Jan 2022 calls. Otherwise wtf is you doin boi

It's mooning bud.  Back to pre delisting price.
Lol, if the odds were anywhere even near 20%, these options would have cost $200,000 or so per contract. 

Honestly, the number of people in here who are even considering this a reasonable risk/reward makes me all the more certain that there is going to be a bubble burst. 

This same type of thinking washed tech out in 2000 so badly it took 15 years for QQQ to recover its high prices.

Its a bit funny how everyone wants to call some of these big tickers like NIO and PLTR ‚Äúmemes‚Äù. As if the people in this sub have the power to move these.

I knew there was a trend going on in retail when Party City smashed earnings far beating expectations the week before kohls earnings. Figured it was a trend. Played both stocks. Originally I had JWN calls actually but switched to kohls because I knew there would be a short squeeze since it was the first retail stock to report that week and analysts would be totally blindsided by it. 

Hell yeah man. People were calling me crazy for it. We need more sure thing bets like this. Bold prediction but I think the retail earnings beat trend is gonna carry over to Gamestop
But wait there's more.....

Yes, because Starship exists. Virgin has about 4 years at best to answer Starship before it's flying regularly and human rated. Virgin so far has taken over a decade to not reach orbit.

Didn‚Äôt make the $150K on PLTR. I think he just made $246 so far. But yeah sell weekly out of the money calls and collect premium.
cool
Let me teach you how I'd teach a baby.  
Lets say you own 10K shares of PLTR at current price i.e. 23.85.  


100 shares = 1 contract  
10K shares = 100 contract. 

Now do you think PLTR will touch 30$ by 12/11? Absolutely not. Thats way higher than the current price. You can sell 100 contracts of PLTR expiring 12/11 and earn a premium of 2600$ this week.   


Lets say you get unlucky and it does touch 30$ by end of the week. Well then you'd have to sell your shares at 30$ each and you still get to collect the premium of 2600$. Don't forget that you'd make 6$ per share if it touches 30$. SO thats profit too and if it doesn't touch 30$, you get to keep your shares and also the premium.   


Now rinse and repeat this every week.

The thing u r missing is 

1. These Companies are now mostly extremely high valued already ( Future growth might be priced in)
2. With these Companies growing , also the Competition is growing 
3. The transition always takes much longer than we think 

I am myself invested in tesla and others , u still gotta be aware of the reality , not saying its bad , just saying the high potential risk involved
It‚Äôs not that bad. Poors have always had to fight for respect and power. I just think it‚Äôs sad that we are so divided and ignorant of our collective power to make a positive difference. I do agree it‚Äôs sad we are heading towards a cyberpunk reality instead of a solarpunk style reality.

I spend a lot of time in the stores doing DD. So do other members of the GME investment community. Been hearing and seeing excellent store foot traffic, they‚Äôve been specifically cited in WSJ as being one of the only stores to experience high foot traffic on Black Friday. 

They appear to be firing on all cylinders from web search and also holiday gifting destination of choice survey data (see Snowk88 on ST) showing them 5th behind Walmart, Amazon,  Target, and dollar stores. Look who is behind them. https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915 https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915

It depends on the disease and average time to outcome metric. For example, if you open any cancer study you will see 5yr survival and recurrence rates published over and over, and unsurprisingly many cancer trials dont finish until they can publish 5 year survival and recurrence rates (usually about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled). The trial CRSP just did was for sickle cell in an effort  to genetically modify the patients to no longer have the trait... since this has never been done before, only CSPR can give you that estimate. That said, you can open the link I provided above, paste the clinical trial number from the abstract into clinicaltrials.gov, look at the start date of the trial until now, and make an assumption about the rate of enrollment of patients (maybe year or so for a few hundred patients in a trial like this), and then from the theoretical last date of enrollment you now can estimate when they would release data, and of course this is all delayed y the time it takes them to set up a multi-institutional phase 3, which will be another year anyway. Like I said - this will take time. Likely another 2-3 years, if I had to guess without doing the shit I discussed above.

This strategy is less about profitability and growth than it is about income. As I mentioned, you collect premiums on each call option you sell, and as long as it‚Äôs not exercised, you‚Äôre able to keep that premium. Now imagine you have 6,000 shares of the stock, like OP does for PLTR. That means that he can sell around 60 call options to the idiots who buy way OTM calls. If he sells that amount, with an average premium of say, $20, that means he would be receiving weekly premiums totaling $1200. And that‚Äôs at a minimum.

Q3 earnings call is Tues after close. Bad earnings are expected, guidance is more important.

Safest play is selling weekly puts because of high IV. Strike depends on risk tolerance and where you're willing to buy. Worst case you buy the dip. In all other cases you make money. Q4 earnings are going to be great

yes, i've release apps on blackberry phones before, it was no different than releasing on apple or play store really, since their phones use android nowadays...., in fact, they even sent me a cool shirt for having a pretty popular app on their app store, i still wear it even after almost 10 years. but i don't think this is about their phones, it's about integrating their systems with amazons appstore in cars.
This is the way
a lot of what youre talking about isn't necessarilly gene lottery based but is more fetal environment or even early childhood environment. it pays to look into shit that disturbs you. I recommend at the very least reading some laymens stuff. check sapolsky out at the very least. funny easy to understand and you'll be more informed than pop science/tabloid level.
But store pickup and same-day delivery would be captured in your e-commerce sales numbers. That means brick-and-mortar daily sales estimates are still large. Basically each store needs to be selling 80 or so equivalents of new $60 games each and every day

Being Self Employed can feel really fucking isolating at times, and you have to learn a lot of self coping mechanisms.

 That being said, once you get your business rolling it's pretty fucking great. I'm traveling out of the country beginning this week all the way to the end of January, and already have about $90k in deals that will be going on during my trip and will close when I get back. And yes, I'll also be trading as well the entire time. 

Anybody who manages to build up like $25k+ in tendies should take some time and start a business. And continue to trade obviously. But get something else that provides you a high income as well. My business is almost passive at this point, because nobody is as skilled as I am and I could do this shit in my sleep.

Appreciate the question. I‚Äôm not trying to be unreasonable, I think the sell-side sucks. The long HF that reached out to me to discuss order numbers & basket sizes also shit on them.
400k yes. 50k no.

You really gotta be new to the game. , revenue future growth might be exciting and yea people buy it , but as soon as expectations are missed (which is often when they are massively overvalued) than u r the one that needs to run . 
Past revenue is exactly the opposite. But thats just my humble opinion
Yeah. It‚Äôs in Korean. The subtitles are big and easy to read in this movie at least
prob excercise or have an eating disorder. thirsty fucks are more the issue than models being models with more control over their hair/makeup/costume choices and presentation. For all we know, they also handle lighting/photography.

There are a lot of players, 

CRSP is first to market but may not be best. Charpentier mainly steers that company.

Doudna still steers NTLA.

Feng Zheng seems to be in charge at EDIT.

Beam is David Liu‚Äôs brainchild.

David Liu has the best technology. I think BEAM is the best long term hold. He has CRISPR with supposedly no off-target effects and it can cut anywhere

People think shits bad now just wait until gene editing really comes into play. It‚Äôll be the political wedge issue of the century. Whose allowed to get treatment? Does it widen the class gap since only the rich can afford treatment? Do we allow the 1% to make their kids smart and athletic while the poors get nothing? Which diseases are bad enough to allow gene treatment? Why does this disease count and not this other one? Then let the religious folks get in the mix. Does gene editing go against gods will? Is curing down syndrome in the womb an act against god? How about autism?

Or China is editing children in the womb and raising them to be super soldiers with extra speed and stamina. How is the US supposed to keep up? Or we have the power to slow aging, but that brings up questions of overpopulation. We could make age related editing illegal, but CEOs and rich people will just fly to countries where it‚Äôs not illegal.

We‚Äôre barreling towards a cyberpunk dystopian hellscape and the world is not ready for it in the slightest

Yo, thank you for the link.
Someone just asked me if they can make a lot of money in the market with 800 bucks, I think I need to refer them here.
This method is called The Wheel. Kamikaze cash explains it really well on YouTube. 

It basically works as a steady income stream, you just need 100 shares of the stock to be able to sell the calls, because if the call gets exercised you need 100 shares of stock to give to the buyer.

When you sell calls on any stock, you collect the premium that the buyer pays for that contract. That‚Äôs your income. The thing is, you don‚Äôt want the contract to end up in the money because the buyer will end up exercising the contract and taking those 100 shares from you, that‚Äôs why you sell way OTM weekly calls because the likelihood of the buyer exercising is very low. 

It‚Äôs a little hard to explain over text, I HIGHLY recommend watching Kamikaze Cash on YouTube he does an excellent job of explaining this strategy and other thetagang strategies.
EVs are waaay to mysterious and stupid to make a logical play on.

I got an $800 yolo. CVS calls few months out?
There are ~5000 stores globally, of which ~3300 are in the U.S and are chiefly (~90%) strip mall based. Shutdown risk minimal. Store traffic limits can be overcome through their store pickup & the free same day delivery they‚Äôre newly offering on $75+ orders.

International is the inverse, being ~90% in shopping malls across their Europe (France, Germany, Italy, mostly) and ANZ footprints. ANZ doing very well earlier in the year when covid wasn‚Äôt shuttering them there.

The launch titles aren‚Äôt anemic, Miles is crushing it. And I see momentum building throughout 2021.

You must be wrong on all your trades but this time you were right
Basically GME is guaranteed to short squeeze unless it doesnt. Almost certain it will be next week, unless it's not.
Or meth
BEAM is the best long term hold. Yes. I would high five you if I could.

NTLA, BEAM, and EDIT all are doing good things. I‚Äôm waiting for the correction to get in bigger. I love Edit‚Äôs focus on the eye and NVTA‚Äôs focus on the liver. 

VRTX basically has exclusive rights to Duchenne‚Äôs muscular dystrophy because they acquired Eric Olson‚Äôs company Exonics. He showed they could correct Duchenne‚Äôs in dogs with CRISPR, so I‚Äôm bullish.

TSLA closed on Friday at 599. Remind me what the option interest was on the 600 calls expiring Friday? Spy closed at 369.85. Remind me what the options interest was for the 370s expiring on Friday? MMs played the fuck out of many call holders this week. Of course if you were holding 365 calls, you made out well but majority were holding 370s as indicated by the options interest.

Not yet but it is coming soon. Most likely going to get a shit ton of snow shortly. January and feb kind of suck usually, but this year I work from home and bought a cottage near a ski station so I am kind of happy about the snow returning.

Because when YOU make it, you can say you did it.
If you are going to do this switch to a broker with low margin rates. At Interactive Brokers they charge around 1.5% currently - this is way lower than most brokers
Good / thoughtful model. Your ecommerce estimate and console sales estimates feel reasonable. That would account for \~$1.1B in revenue. That means you are counting on $2B in in-store revenue (excluding console sales). With \~5,700 stores globally, that would be $363K per store for the quarter, equating to \~$4K in daily sales, per store. That seems high given so many of these stores are in malls where foot traffic is down - more cities are going on lockdown, etc. Also, there just doesn't seem to have been any major AAA titles released in this quarter (other than expectations for Cyberpunk 2077) and the launch titles for PS5 and Xbox One X have been pretty anemic

Come of Pfizer.
It's a good question and a lot of people don't understand options and just trade stocks. Options have something people refer to as Intrinsic Value that depreciates over time based on market demand. There are at least a few idiots willing to buy just about any contract until it's indeed worthless, so they have some value until the expiration date. Obviously, this becomes less likes as you get closer to an expiry, so the intrinsic value continues to depreciate until then

Look how fast the recovery was for the 2018 crash and obviously this one as well. Consider how much more liquidity, retail investment, and universal consensus there is on buying dips. We‚Äôre in a new era where keeping markets propped up by the fed and congress is a major priority. I expect any 30-40% drops in the future to correct as fast if not faster unless it‚Äôs more of an apocalyptic scenario. Seems like a worthwhile gamble, but a gamble nevertheless.
In theory yes. The issue of course is that the company could do poorly resulting in BOTH a stock and div decline. 

Godspeed

I‚Äôm bullish on DKNG long term, my options expiring worthless not withstanding. Good earnings and momentum towards online sports betting nationally as well as internationally, and DKNG is perfectly positioned, it feels more like consolidation into smart money currently, while they‚Äôre trying to avoid having it have a massive momentum spike to continue picking up cheap shares.
What are your thoughts about the GME short squeeze theory floating around here lately?
Yes. Bill Ackman. Favorable structure to share holders and rewards long term holds. Potential target is big with. 7B SPAC lots of speculation it is Stripe. That would be a HUGE deal.

which is why it will be so easy for competitor auto makers to catch up. The only "moat" tesla has is in data/software, but there have been many companies developing self driving tech, and many larger software companies who are better at AI. There is going to be a company that just leases out their self driving tech to all the other auto makers and best case for Tesla bulls we basically have it look something like Tsla = aapl, and then someone will fill the android role like samsung does.
Only options. Typically at least 2-4 week expiry OTM. If I like a position I'll roll it and pick up a variety of strikes with early and far expires. I have some long dated Tesla calls for Jan and Feb back from Sept. That is the longest, currently sitting on a set of APHA calls for mid January to play the Senate run off. 

I made a 10x on MRNA, took profits and took later strikes. Have a play on JKS earnings Monday and holding ENPH calls.


My losers have been with JKS when the earnings changed from late November. Also PTON calls. I've played SPY calls weeklies and I'm even on that. Not going to get into those again, have me panicked in the middle of the night for futures.

I guess my plays are a bit meme, but got out of NIO before the run up. No position with gme, had a minor thing with pltr and then got out once I made a quick buck. I played SPCE once in a while but not for this bump. I got to 100k once before on the back of my JKS exposure in Oct, then it crashed. I learned from  that if a position runs up sell it take profits, roll to further OTM with different expires  you get the most pop on OTM when it first starts to move. So you can still get lots of return without sitting on your original position. Now I'm up on a variety of things, diversity is a thing.
Yeah but their mascot is that fuckboy, it is much less visually appealing.

It's all fun and games until your calls go ITM, you lose your shares, buy them back in at ATH, the stock tanks, and you have to consider selling CC's above your your cost basis or accepting emaciated premiums.

You own 100 shares of X, X trades at $10  
You sell weekly covered calls (agreeing to sell your 100 shares at $15 price for Z premium)  
Share price ends week at $12.50, you keep your premium, and shares and rinse and repeat next week.  
  
Eventually you‚Äôll get assigned (share price ends week above $15, and you‚Äôll have to sell 100 shares at $15 even if market is $17)  
At this point you sell CSP (Cash secured puts) because you want those shares back, collecting additional premium. 
Market value is now $17, you sell a put for $12.  
Repeat weekly, eventually you‚Äôll get assigned and now you own back your 100 shares.  
The goal is pick a company you like and think will grow long term and collect premium on the way

I'm lucky, I work on a different mountain so it's not really a huge deal for me if I don't up for a month or two.  I'm guessing most resorts are going to be screwed because of exactly that though.  Why in the hell would anyone pay for a trip like that unless they were sure it's going to happen?
