I use debit spreads all the time to manage risk. I had a bunch of TSLA 12/4 575/580s earlier this week and decided on a dip to leg out (buy back the sell legs). Got really lucky and woke up to Goldman price target increase, allowing the options to exceed what would've been the max profit of the spreads. Immediately rolled the profit into 550/600's in hopes of making the same play again this week.
And this is all old news.
If you bought Uber stock at IPO, it would have taken you over 2 and a half years to break even. And if you bought calls, you would have most likely been wiped out. ABNB will surely beat its IPO price at some point, the question is whether to jump into it immediately or not
Looks like you didn’t wake up down 60% every other day like I do. Fuck you and spend that on a dildo so you can go fuck yourself congrats

“Nice belts”
💯
They say they will move with the times. Right now full electric nor hydrogen will not be feasible, the infrastructure is not there.

They have stated that once hydrogen is more available they are willing to move to that and they won’t need to change their power trains or anything at all just change the generator or whatever. 

The company has a future and will transition with the times.
I thought that was JaQuellen
If you went skydiving and your chute didn’t deploy would you want  to land head first or feet first
I have spoken
I have a lot of respect for someone making such a play as I don't think it was so surefire. Their sales struggle to cater to younger demographics although their pivot to activewear has been making strides. Their online and Rack/Hautelook off price has been their saving grace while their flagship stores continue to bleed. They are still closing more stores than opening and their credit card products are getting worse when compared to competing products. Although Amazon is always the competing giant on the horizon, COVID just expedited the company's need to catch up with the times. They lost a decent chunk of their workforce due to COVID cuts. It should be interesting to see as to whether they will be able to uphold their strong customer service despite the losses.

My prediction is that funds only **partially** buy their TSLA shares by the inclusion date, and will wait until January for (what they expect will be) a drop, since they didn't bum-rush to fill in December when everyone thought they would.  Funds aren't *required* to get TSLA even if they benchmark against the S&P.  I'm also not from the future so don't take this as gospel but something to consider -- would you want to buy @ ATH or wait for a down-trend to buy thousands of shares?

propecia is not without side effects though and takes a year to start working

That article was made by an Australian short seller! They said they MIGHT be investigated and shit and that they are similar to Nikola and that are a fraud.

They are not like Nikola they have real products on the road and they are using natural gas with 700+ stations. Not like hydrogen with 1 station in all of American.
It basically traded around $25 from January 2017 to January 2020 - I think it has a lot of room to run. We are only up $5 if you look at it that way. I’m doing a deeper dive on financials.

The pathetic firm with -22% ytd returns that manipulated this down more than likely covered Thursday, and we have new food coming hopefully tomorrow, if not sometime soon. It’s confirmed. You don’t make money buying at the top of a chart, you do so by buying it’s bottom. Bullish

this holds no merit whatsoever but thought id share some whispers from the deep dark web with you all. this is for PLTR bull gang only. cannot be confirmed. take with grain of salt

>!ive heard some whispers via internet chat rooms that some positive news is brewing low key 12/8, public will not know about it. i asked this certain someone if they knew what the news was. they said "Not the specifics cause its under contract still". now, i could be lying to your fat fucking faces and trying to shill PLTR and scare bears... but im not. just some shit i heard. no proof whatsoever and its from some random guy on the internet. but after the whole PSTH shit (and that guy deleted his account btw, lol) it seems you guys care about rumors. so yea!<

The benchmark is your beta. If you wanted to compare Tesla to just the auto market then the auto market in this case would have a beta of 1 (identity principle) and Tesla would then be compared to that basket.

The benchmark is the item you're comparing to and also where beta is derived from.

When you say, "The Market" for instance, there is no "The Market" as an actual benchmark; while it is very easy to fall into the jargon the only way to make a realistic comparison is to take an index (often referred to as "The Market" as a misnomer) and use that.

I find Airbnb attractive in part because you get a wide range of options that no hotel company *would* ever provide even if they could. I’m talking yurts in the middle of nowhere, camping sites on private property, etc. You’re never going to see Marriott offer yurts in the woods, but Airbnb offers yurts in the woods *and* high end houses and villas.

Dude, I have no fucking idea. Nothing makes sense. It feels like all of us autists are running around free in the insane asylum like fucktards. 

In all seriousness, I never got into picking stocks and just picked up 2k of GME and Tesla but sold a day later. I started thinking to myself that my uncles who are not that intelligent are making money off this market. When people who don’t know what to do are making crazy money (at least returns that are crazy to boomers), it seems like it’s hit the top. 

But I’m just another retard in wallstreetbets, wtf do I know?

Based on the number of initial targets he quoted (150) it has to include that list. People are assuming that him approaching a company means something, when it appears to me that he's approaching every one of the hundred possible and seeing if they're interested.

That also matches up with the AMA a person from a SPAC team, who talked about how many meetings they took when looking for targets.  It isn't a process where you just talk to one company - you shotgun and then narrow down from there.

That's why I thought it was shady as fuck when AirBnB came out and said they rejected Ackman. It was a bullshit "we're important" play on their part, they could have kept silent about him approaching them like he was approaching 149 other companies, but they wanted to seem like they were special for getting asked and saying no.  

Seemed immature and bad business, compare that to the classy way both parties have handled it with Stripe, making it clear it isn't happening but not denigrating the other party.
Actually same. Trying to quit but it's tough

 You wake up cold and everything is pitch black. You can't see a thing but you place your arms out in front of you and take slow steps so that you don't bump into anything. You begin to feel something brush on top of your head. You reach your hand up and feel crispy dead roots above you. You now know that you are someplace underground. You continue in the darkness as it is your only option other than suffocating from lack of oxygen. You continue down what feels to you like a tunnel, and suddenly feel cemented ground beneath your feet. The tunnel's width and height begin to expand as you gradually lose their touch on your hands. You begin to, what feels like, aimlessly wander throughout the space. You suddenly stop as you feel a cold bar on your right hand. As you investigate, you figure out that this object is metal, and seems to be a part of what feels to you like large, spaced, shelving. As you continue your adventure you look up and see a small, distant hole of what looks like an old ceiling where wind and sunshine and barely coming in. You let out a sigh of relief that you at least know you have a small air supply. You then begin to feel a small warmth and see a small orange light a little bit away from you. As you approach the light and warmth, you see that it is a man built fire on the cement floor with what looks like an orange object being burned in it with some words you can barely make out printed on them. In a white text, you see the words "More saving. More doing." This reminds you of when a local Home Depot was swallowed by the biggest earthquake known to man that cracked the ground and swallowed it whole. This then makes you wonder if this Home Depot is the same from your thoughts. As you remember this event, a distant chanting draws your attention. Before you investigate, you decide to equip yourself with a possible weapon. You take a burning log from the fire with the orange cloth wrapped around the edge opposite your hands. With this burning cloth, you now have a light, and a weapon just in case. As the chanting becomes louder and clearer, you can just barely make out the words: "God ith dead here, what only remaineth is the hope that only our magnificent leader Hometh Depoteth can save us now." As you turn a corner you see a group of people around mid 40's hovering around the fire you just visited, wrapped in torn orange cloths. A crackle from your fire stick alerts them of your presence, as they all turn to look at you in surprise, and partial fear. Once they see you, they immediately back away and huddle in fear of you. You realize that these people have probably been here for many years, and have had some sort of abuse towards them, in order for them to be afraid of you like this. You try to tell them that you want to help them, but they ignore you and remain in fear. You decide that this is a waste of time, and you decide to take action. You take your log and hold it in front of you in hopes to find some sort of exit, or escape. During your search you hear a very faint sound, that sounds like a short song on repeat. As you get closer to the music you find yourself standing in front of what looks like an office door. You open it as the sound gets even louder. You see a skeleton sitting in an office chair in front of an old computer. The computer has spider webs along with its screen, along with spider webs on the desk, chair, skeleton, and partial floor. On the computer, you see a picture of a home depot, with the caption "The Home Depot Theme Song for 10 Hours." You decide to look on the computer for any means of escape. On the computers' home page, you see "If I die, read the file."  So you decide to click on it. You are then immediately bombarded by 69 pages of what looks like a daily log of this man's life underground. You decide to sit down and start reading, because what could possibly happen from reading a log. Before you know it, you've read the whole thing. You have discovered that the skeleton was a crazy evil genius that had plotted out Home Depot's fall. The evil scientist worked for months to plan out placing small bombs around Home Depot, after blowing up the land beneath it. This resulted in Home Depot falling into the earth, and being called an earthquake. You then see an old office phone next to the computer and try to call the authorities for help, but it is so old it doesn't work. You then go back to exploring the building for possible exits, but all are blocked off by the dirt. Your hope for an escape slowly begins to fade as your options seem to be running out. But just when you are about to give up, you come up with an idea to make a tunnel. You begin to bring the dirt from the exits into the building and grab a shovel to dig your tunnel. You think back to earlier when you felt roots on your head. So this must mean that the surface is not too far away. This still leaves hope for you, and a chance for the other people to escape. You begin to start shoveling and realize that it is a lot of work for one person and that you will need the others to help you. You begin to go and search for a small group of people around the fire. It feels like it takes forever, but you finally find them. They are still around the fire, but you approach them without the fire, and in a much calmer way. They seem to be skeptical of you, but not afraid. It seems that they are afraid of people who control fire, but not of the fire itself. Weird. So you calmly approach them and tell them your idea. They seem a bit confused at first, but they are trying to understand. You then motion for them to follow you to the exit, and they start to do so. On your way to the exit, you grab buckets, so that it will be easier to move the dirt out of the way for the diggers. You then begin to assign some of them to different roles, and then you begin to dig with them. This gradually increases the progress made. Using the small hole in the ceiling to tell day from night, you keep a log of days and progress made. After several months have passed, you begin to see roots again. This sparks up hope for you and the tribe. But only about a few days later, you breach the surface. You feel the cold, cool air against your face, and this gives you immense relief. You help the tribe to the surface where they are overwhelmed with the sight. This draws you to believe that they haven't truly seen the surface in many years. Some of the older members begin to cry and hug you as they begin this new chapter in their lives. You watch them walk away, and you too, begin to leave, feeling like a hero.

If I had that much money I'd be in blue chip stocks while selling covered calls and/or low delta strangles. TSLA has a P/E ratio of 1200 when a normal P/E ratio is below 100 and below 50 for a strong company. TSLA has almost no redeeming qualities beyond a vague pipedream of somehow controlling the power supply of the entire world 30 years from now. Investing in TSLA now is just straight up gambling. Thats what you do with 3k not 300k.

I would venture to say your logic is as flawed as mine. Just because he hasn’t invested in hype trans doesn’t mean he can’t or won’t. There are two confined approaches that were made to both Airbnb and stripe. A third approach was rumored with Bloomberg. What leads you to believe he couldn’t still be trotting down the path with a similar type company.

I think sp500 and dji might get a moderate correction, tech keeps going. This is the best case scenario, lock down now, give people money to stay at home and by Christmas people can relax a little bit.

Thanks for the info.  A couple questions: Don't people get vaccines in order for the body to develop antibodies in case of infection?  How are these any different from any other vaccine?  People will still get infected with the flu virus but because they have antibodies the body is able to fight it off.  So I don't get the alarmist position that, hey, if people find out they'll still get the virus but their body is able to fight it off because of the vaccine, they'll turn away from the vaccine.  Are you just saying that the particular framing of the virus still being within the body will cause an irrational fear of the vaccine?

$264.80 when converted from HK to US. so less than $2.50 under the US Close, could be worse.

They're rumored because they're hype stocks pushed by people naming companies they'd like to own, all three are clearly off the table so it's meaningless that people have named them. People wrongly guessing three tech companies doesn't mean it's tech. 

If anything it shows how horrible people are at correctly guessing and we probably won't actually hear the target named until Ackman releases it.

Staring at the bottom of your glass

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

But tendies come slow and they go so fast

You see gold when you close your eyes

Maybe one day you'll understand why

Everything you hold surely dies

But you only think of gold when economy burning low

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you love gold when you let her go

Only know reach new highs after testing lows

Only hate the road when you're missing home

Only know you love gold when you let her go

Staring at the robinhood in the dark

Same old empty feeling in your heart

Cause tendies comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see gold when you fall asleep

But never to touch and never to keep

Cause you loved it too much and you yolod too deep

Well you only need gold when economy burning low

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you love her when you let her go

ah the traditional preemptive celebration by bears thinking futures matter only to get their shorts blown out at open when we continue the bull rally
PSX is undervalued in its case. It almost broke even last quarter while VLO/HFC/MPC and everyone else lost billions. It wasn’t rewarded for crushing earnings. It should be higher than where it is now by a long shot

There were some down days. The week of Thanksgiving was red the whole week for PSX at least and that now appears to be a J hook

I’m going bearish on energy latter December but with vaccine news on the 10th and 17th, which just seem like formalities at this point, the only negative would be no stimulus. Or maybe mass lockdowns again. But any down movement is going to be just random walk stuff and not a trend

Oil is probably heading to $50 by the end of next week but it has no business being even where it is right now. Also concerned that the dollar stops selling off and uncertainty around the Jan 5th runoff. I’m at least exiting my energy stuff mid December and will buy puts depending on how high things go by the end of December

For about the same price, you could be closer to the money with Mar 19 2021 $35c. You are buying time value with the June $40. When I bought the Mar 19’s there were no June’s available yet. Depending on how this thing runs, I may roll into June. I’m definitely holding this and not looking for a quick buck. I think this could be a big score with some patience.

Any successful company taking advantage of the newest innovations (5g, machine learning, AI, etc) are going to be profitable, I believe, in the next year and going forward they'll continue to climb. Tech is unstoppable in my view.
Risky for sure. I still have margin ptsd from the march covid crash. I had a $65k margin call on my tsla stock, so that all got wiped out overnight. 2 days later the market recovered enough to be above the margin call trigger and only kept rising, but my stock was already seized and sold by then. $65k of pre-split tsla stock. That would've been massive tendies right now. The memory still makes me wince.

Bears when we hit ATH this week: *pikachu face*
Bare burger!!
You're dealing with two different animals.  When you're chosing an intra day, or a weekly, whatever, high, you don't have that same sort of fixed reference point.  It's mostly based on your subjective opinion.  As such, it's hard to model that and check it going backwards.

On the flip side, this is one thing you can look at going backwards because it isn't based on some subjective, more or less random picking of a high or low, it's based on a fixed daily set of events.  

It's also worth pointing out that the statistical edge it offers isn't anything to get super excited about.  Think of buying and just holding as your benchmark, or a sort of null hypothesis.  When you model the buy the close sell the open over a sufficient time frame you beat that benchmark, but it's not super significant.  As pointed out higher in the thread, the comparison only lead to a few percent more gain over the same time period.  It's misleading in a way to present this against buy the open and sell the close as OP did.  Or it is in my opinion.  

If I'm going to test any theory I'm going to compare it to buying and holding the S&P 500 long term.  All that's really here is that buying the close and selling the open performs marginally better, reliably, than simply buying and holding.

It might also be cool if I pointed out that when a study of this strategy first came out a couple years ago I pulled down data and modeled it myself and came to the same, less formal conclusions by picking random beginning and end points for the same strategy in tons of iterations and found that it reliably performed marginally better than buying and holding.

Which also makes it worth pointing out that I played with modeling daily highs.  Trying to define them mathematically and call them reliably.  If I'd found something, I'd be lounging on a beach in a warmer climate right now being served drinks by a woman in a coconut bikini with an exotic name, but nothing worked reliably.

Which is basically my overall "philosophy" on investing currently.  You can either pick a strategy, like buy and hold or buy the close and sell the open, that generates long term returns (and for the record, I just buy and hold almost exclusively in a triple leveraged fund) reliably, or you basically treat all other strategies (in a long term sense) as random chance ... or gambling.  Hence, WSB.

You might be right but the three companies rumored are all techy. Airbnb, stripe and Bloomberg.

Where do you get this nonsense?

The presence of free-ranging cattle provides beneficial topsoil on farms that allows for healthier crops and sustained ecosystems, and the argument for methane fucking up the ozone layer has been debunked time and time again.

We've destroyed the land with industrial farming, using pesticides to basically wipe out entire ecosystems that thrived when cattle/bison roamed the land.

Also you must be the biggest cuck in all the land if you think beef tastes bad. Sounds like you just eat well-done with ketchup or some nasty shit like that.

You're misinterpreting the word ***"unicorn"***. You seem to think it means *"tech"* and/or *"silicon valley startup"*, while Ackman uses it as a placeholder for *"billion dollar company"*.

That's one of the main reasons you have a bunch of kids running around claiming there's a very small pool of companies to pick from and naming tech hype brands. In reality he said he had a ton of companies in his target pool, and it's much more likely Ackman is looking for stable cashflow from a "mature" (as he's said) name brand.

It will probably be something recognizable, but more similar to his previous spacs with Burger King than with something fintech like Stripe (and it definitely won't be Stripe, all parties involved have ruled that out).

Also your TLDR should be: Don't buy it right now because it's hideously overpriced at the moment. It's a pile of cash in escrow that people are paying 30% over nominal value for.

Dumbass here,

Edit: I’m wrong
That’s the strategy indicated in the chart. You could certainly choose to do so, but if you’re just a retail investor, you don’t have to hold yourself to it.

Personally, I’d like to see the same chart made, except instead of selling at open no matter what, you hold when down, and double down when you’re down x%. Isn’t that what most people actually do to some degree anyway?
Thanks for the heads up

Robinhood doesn’t offer IRAs.
We are closing on a building in the new year. 2 apartments, 1 commercial. Will renovate it mostly ourselves and live there virtually rent free because the commercial unit covers the entire mortgage and costs.

As a kid I never imagined having $1000 to my name, let alone $100k or $1M.

And now, with what I have, I can see others with so much more and it’s close for me, maybe, if I keep at things, but also so unattainable.

I probably do have it made, especially considering where I come from. And when compared to my cousins or friends I grew up with, I’m rich, but I have never felt that way.

So this is actually a biological/ecological phenomenon. I watch Bret Weinstein’s Dark Horse Podcast. He’s an evolutionary biologist who calls out the extreme liberal left on their bullshit. 

I forget what the phenomenon is called, but he literally used the example of the color red when foraging for berries. Basically, as something you’re looking for (like red berries) gets scarcer and scarcer, you become more sensitive to even the smallest indication of its presence (red). So even the less ripe (less red) berries, you’ll still be able to find, because your brain becomes more sensitive to the color red as it gets scarce.

He was using it to illustrate how/why “anti-racists” act like they see more racism in places where there is very little racism, but I think it might apply to the 🌈🐻 overreaction to even small amounts of red

This reminds me that I have a book called Economics and Evolution I’ve been meaning to read for almost a full decade. There’s a beautiful overlap between evolutionary principles and economic principles

I'm not uneasy. I am extremely certain it will increase in value. I'm thinking opportunity cost. If this call only generates 150% over an entire year I'm thinking there could be other plays. I'm extremely bullish on bit coin and started to scale into miners
Yeah sure. Sounds good to me. Let me just go grab my 10k I have lying around.

It's printing money to raise asset prices (mainly bonds, but that forces more private money into stocks), sure they can sell those assets, but in the medium to long term I doubt they will. (Unless there's serious inflation, which they have said they'll be more tolerant of, so idk)

I had $120k in call options expire about 3 weeks ago in PSX, unfortunately I was in too early when I bought back in August. I’m currently 110 of the OI on the PSX $65c for 12/18 and some random OXY calls just for shits and giggles. Pretty sure I’m making that money back on PSX after Thursday vaccine approval and a stimulus bump tomorrow or Tuesday would be icing on the cake

Everything in oil was in a descending wedge for 3 months, it was just a matter of when. Wish I did shares at first though so theta didn’t eat me alive

I still think refiners are the play even with crack spreads still depressed... I also can’t believe poop producers like OXY and MRO are as high as they are
Yeah good analysis. That being said, way too many people waste so much time and effort fussing over tax implications while making insanely bad trades/investments because they don’t spend any time doing quality DD.

Ah nice. Good choice on your pick then. I'm quite biased towards AMD increasing in share price and succeeding as a company. Depending on your risk tolerance, scale some out until you feel comfortable. I don't have any doubts that AMD will only continue increasing in value (with small pullbacks) towards Jan 2022. So fully up to you! What makes you feel uneasy enough to ask?  


FYI, I don't have a position in AMD, but want one.

I took profits two weeks ago, which was a terrible idea. I was happy because I was -$60k on my way OTM calls for US Steel that I had been bagholding 4 months, and all of a sudden in 5 days I was up like $15k and cashed out. Now those same calls would be worth like $200k more than I sold them for.

I was so happy to get my money back(plus some)  that I wasn't mad at the time, but it was a bad impulsive decision that will force me to be more conservative than I'd like to be. Oh well, ideally the next time I won't be so wrapped up in a single decision that I lose my ability to make rational decisions.

Ban penny stocks.

Not GME calls tho that's a good idea.
It’s shorted at like 130% (at under $15 so they are underwater already) so if everyone is holding shares the shorts have to buy at inflated prices to pay the shares back, whatever holders will let it go for. Could be $50, $100 or $1000 a share. Will be relatively quick (couple days) but when it squeezes will violently shoot up. It’s been very strong last couple weeks even with shorts trying to suppress it. A good earnings call (mainly guidance) or buyout could be the catalyst. If not everyone is looking at next EC as the right catalyst, qtr with new systems out. 

Shorts speculated they would go bankrupt. It’s obvious that’s not the situation now. They have 750 mil cash against 430mil debt a lot of which they are paying off early. And they have positive cash flow.

Edit: Calls aren’t too bad but with high IV will be very expensive and this is 100% a bet. No one knows when it will squeeze.

Stim checks will be brought back into play for this next relief package tomorrow and it'll pass this week. There will be a huge celebration and this final pump will wipe out most of the rest of the bears. The ones who've been holding and hoping for a correction for months will finally lose hope. Buying confidence and greed will be at an all time high. Tiktok, wsb and fintwit dweebs celebrating, feeling invincible start going all in. That's when I'll load up on short positions (VIX calls, SPY puts). VIX will finally come alive and there will be no more fake vaccine/stim pumps to save the retards.

President and CEO Timothy Archer got One Million shares of LRCX as signing bonus on 1/1/2020 at the average price of $FREE. The price of stock has increased by “I am rich AF, you retard” %

Hey moron, it’s an exhibition match... Even if mayweather loses it doesn’t effect his record. You have the IQ level equivalent to a rock

It's obviously a fake. Real Yellin Janet's profile would say "Buy the dip, retard!" not "Always bought the dip".

The word "retard" like the hologram on authentic NFL tickets, man.
Is their even a single bear alive?
ur actually just uninformed lol what’s that have to do with any1 else ?????????
Commence the gap up to tendie land. A true Christmas miracle is upon us this year.

Why not both?
Move to Singapore, no capital gain tax only dividend withholding tax (for US securities) but who cares about  dividend anyway.
meh, you guys ruin positions too often

also a bit of a superstition thing
if only they let you deduct the taxes you would have paid for the short term losses (if they were gains) from the taxes you will pay for the long term gains you could get a negative tax rate from this.
Sacrifice Rudy for thou puts

Also totally unrelated question, but if you get Reddit premium just for 1 month and then cancel it, can you keep that little mini-me avatar add-on? Or do you have to keep premium for it to not go away?
PLTR is the real shill.  It took me for a ride and dumped me somewhere.  I'm still trying to figure out where I am.
Wait for a dip... In a few months
Not until 390
Big short
This happens every day..?
You might be right. I'm factoring in a 5-6% overall market correction soon.
Yup I am thinking the same thing. Curious when you go up big do you take profits on your longs and rebuy in or just hold. Couple times I was up big an could of rebought the following day but then again I tried that with UAL and got fucked this past week
Y’all don’t realize Mayweather fights are NOT entertainment for the non-boxer fan. This dude is all defense. Paul will be missing every punch.

Wouldn’t be surprised if they call this a draw just to fuck Mayweather though😂
Every day is the lowest price you can get on tsla
Yeah dude Asian thing is down 2%
Thanks for spiking IV tomorrow.   Good opportunity to sell more puts.
Nah. I just want to say RIP
last monday was SHIT
Circuit city 😂

Unlikely. You would have to assume that stocks trade flat while GDP recovers for it to be “fixed”. If stocks go up with GDP then we stay at all time highs.

I typed NAM into Robinhood and the first stonk to show up is XPEV
I've seen this show before: we'll open red, Larry Kudlow while still mostly asleep will be pushed toward a TV camera, mumble something good about the economy, we'll see several face-ripping rallies, bears will start downvoting, rinse, repeat.
Idk, either 25c or 30c
hold on he might be onto something

i'm feeling positive RKT mojo for this week from many different corners of the interwebs.
yooo this thread really reading like the top is here. every time the sub population explodes and 50% of comments start parroting "imagine being a bear" without any backing you know it's over
Bears out here celebrating that their puts are gonna print tomorrow. They can’t contain themselves they are dancing all over the place. As for the bulls, they are in shambles right now.
I’ve been beating on oil’s drums for 3 weeks. Check my post history related to trading wedges. I talk to someone in there about XOM $38C that had printed, then pulling profits and doing a reverse wedge to profit 1000% in 2 days off of the puts(if he would’ve pulled and still held half those calls would be on fire). I’ve been bullish on XOM since the Friday at close prior to their Tuesday exdiv.
Sorry, I misunderstood the wording. I’m defining market as the entire stock market. And a benchmark could be for the entire stock market or a certain industry. So if you wanted to compare the volatility of Tesla to the auto market specifically and not the entire market, would you still use beta?

People buying McMansions are literally retarded. First of all, they are ugly as hell, is everyone fucking blind or do they just equate size with looks? 

Second of all, these people are so retarded they don’t even realize having a mcmansion is the definition of middle class. Real house wealth is defined by attention to detail and uniqueness. McMansions don’t even have floor or ceiling moldings most of the time, and it looks like someone hit copy paste all down the block.

Yeah, I'm thinking tomorrow could be the last opportunity in certain tickers before the vaccine is approved and shit moons for another couple weeks. Maybe I'll just stick to shorter calls for now and load during the next pullback(which likely happens after the new year.

damn Wendy's paying well
SPLK is vastly superior to ESTC... The only reason ESTC is making gains is because SPLK is a shit ton expensive but honestly well worth it so an ORG not using SPLK to it's full potential will certainly make the move to ESTC because it is free. key word, free...
I have $12k of credit card debt and $20k ish of student loan debt. I’ve made a 30% profit so far which is higher than my credit card interest rates, even with the capital gains tax I will have to pay..

It’s not exactly the Dave Ramsey method, but so far it’s working, and it makes me feel retarded enough to belong here despite only having $10k in my portfolio. 

I promised myself I’d pull all my money out of when I’ve made enough to completely pay it all off at once. Almost there. I’ll probably leave some profit in to play with.. but anyway that’s my retarded plan.

I really wish I’d done this back in college. I graduated in 2016 and went back for more last year. I don’t remember exactly when but I signed up for some stock investment account in college hoping to buy some Tesla and Apple but I was turned off by the brokerage fees. Regrets regrets but here I am.

Tesla equities are like bombs being juggled and passed around - make sure you're not the one holding when they go off lol.
Don't be fooled. Everybody has doubled their portfolio in the last 3 month. Even/Especially boomers holding. If you bought tesla at 385 a month ago and sold it at 620, you already went 80% of the way, just on one stock, in a month.
Yeah, I'm in the same boat as well. My account has been going up like $5-15k per day for the last couple weeks. And I have a lot of Jan Calls, so I'm likely going to sell everything in the next 10-15 days. But it's so tough to get so little for my money when I had 1500 calls in certain tickers for cheap earlier this year.

Wow looks like an upset at the last minute: I will now be shitting on McMansions. Communists are off the hook for now.

People who buy bland ass McMansions are the same type of people that think they’re really risking the biscuit by buying aapl $100 ITM calls and setting a 2% stop loss just because they “trade options”.
Somebody was a good boy! If you’re not barking later I’ll make you breakfast too!
I don’t think I’ll jump in right away in C3 and HYFM. Maybe day trade and pop out. Wait for options and just put in a leap with money I’m willing to lose.

I sold OTM CCs when I bought in at 18, thinking it wouldn't go past 24-26 by EoM... a week later I'm down like >80% on all of them. Bought them back black friday morning at the high for almost 2k in losses. Literally 30 mins later it starts tanking. A couple of trailing stops triggered when I wasn't paying attention, by EoD i had lost most of my PLTR shares. Still made a good profit but also salty about those CCs

When you short sell you borrow the stock, sell it on the market at current price, and then wait for the stock to go down so you can give the stock back after buying at a lower price. If the stock doesn't drop in a reasonable amount of time, you are just burning cash in interest, so you liquidate your position by buying the stock to pay back the lender. If a lot of people do this at once the stock goes sky and the short sellers that didn't liquidate go shit themselves.
Were you okay with losing that money to begin with?
Hold up who changed the vibe? Bear season!!!! Run 🏃‍♂️ it 🤾
As Cowboys fans the question we should be asking ourselves is should we take Justin Fields. 

Assuming we pick 4 he is likely available. 

Personally I love Dak, but with our current roster I have a tough time seeing a path forward paying one guy 40 per season.

Difference in cost over 5 years between Fields and Dak would be $180M. You can do a lot for the OL and secondary with that $$$

Agreeing to have a kid when neither of you are even dating seems a bit irresponsible on her part. She’s basically willingly bringing a kid into the world who will be disadvantaged it’s whole life.
I mean who would ever lie on the internet, that's almost as absurd as printing infinity dollars and multiplying the fed balance sheet

Don’t buy options. Buy shares. Interest rate to keep shares shorted at a record high, Mr. Chewy recently going big on changing the company. Microsoft paying them for nothing. Negotiating with Sony. No one knows for sure but signs are pointing to it
Yes it does. I’ve got a chunk of the 1,192 OI.  Also some common.  To get some tighter spreads this needs to see some more daily trading volume.

Hide all your finances from her. If she hasn’t already discovered how America rewards single mothers, she will soon. Soon she will discover title IVD incentives and take you to court for maximum child support. Here’s my advice: hide all assets, buy some rental properties and hide them behind shell corporations and move all funds to off shore accounts beyond American jurisdiction. Set up trust funds. Be prepared to get ass raped for 19 years. There’s no bankruptcy on child support and if you fall behind they add interest to you arrears. It’s become a felony after a certain amount of money. Good luck my dude
Yes straight up. But you can’t erase those even in bankruptcy so if we enter a second Great Depression don’t @ me

No, home essentials and groceries are more expensive because of the Jones Act. Puerto Rico was on the cusp of independence as the US invaded and has been fucking it since for over a hundred years.

The exdiv is the reason I say buy. Markets tend to go up a couple days after the ex div/on the DOR. Of course, you probably know that since you know about dividend tendencies.      

As far as fraud case payouts, I’m not worried. Look at Goldman Sachs and how they gained points the same day they release news that they settled a 2b fraud case. I’m less worried about the news right now and more worried about bond yields.

If you are just starting college and you don’t need the student loan money, it’s always good to take the subsidized loans and put them in the stock market right? Since they don’t accrue interest while you’re in school you can have them in QQQ for 4-5 years and make around 10% per year right?

I'm with you on HYLN, as somebody who works in logistics I was extremely impressed with their product lineup. Especially the fact that their tractors weigh so much less than tesla tractors! LTL companies are going to eat that shit up cause they want to have maximum range and weight capacity, which is tough to get with a tesla truck. I think it's a little spec rn with a high valuation but it's at a enticing level and has a fantastic future. Just needs one bit of good news to pop massive. Great buy OP!

You were an excellent salesman and knew how to highlight the features.

You were practiced in handling objections when dealt with questions. 

When asked : " Why have you had trash performance in previous years?" 

Response: "Past performance is not indication of future, market reasons, external locus of control, reversion to the mean" 

When asked: "what are expected returns to be like when you have positive performance?" 

Response : "point to previous success and suggest and imply and implicate without promising".

When in doubt. Lean on a big brand and flash big brand names and various other investors in the brand.

Indeed, I sold my 12/11 200c, the profits were too good. Rolled out to 12/24.  12-12 is another big shopping day for them.
you're a little whore, i'd rather read replies from a mod.
Was really close to climbing out of a -%80 hole over 6 months and had to do something stupid like hold overpriced SNOW puts over weekend. Didn't even wait for it to become established meme where people post rocket emojis next to it's ticker name daily smh

Being in this shit really desensitizes you to money in the real world. Was walking through wal mart yesterday and saw their 80” tv’s on sale. Saw the price and was like damn.... I could have bought 6 of those mother fuckers with the money I lost last week.
It's fine as long as you're not holding something retarded like a 50c that expires in 5 minutes.
Why
They are practically worthless so prolly vertical
Excellent work
Amen
We went up 15% in November alone bro
Same on the 12/18 25 puts, sold them a few weeks back for a good premium. If they’re assigned I won’t mind increasing my bags but I have a feeling this stays above 25 by then.
why

I’m not saying that debt in itself is a problem but there are companies that have taken Irresponsible levels of leverage, even pre Covid, that expose them to collapse if their growth projections miss in the slightest and/or the interest rate start raising to semi normal levels

I know of some tickers that have a good possibility of absolutely fucking mooning, but if I tell you guys, then Shitron is going to know about it and they are going to come up with a reason they should go down so they can actually buy some since they are always late to the party and are incapable of making DD by themselves

Been buying BB shares for 5 years and still buying, convinced of the business pivot and long term success.  Thinking about doubling down on shares

The one I worked at would rant and rave about being up 46% in 2008.

So this is how the rug pull begins... not with a bang, but with a GUH.
Now its free for everyone, yes the outages are a pain in the ass but a lot other platforms are experiencing the same (etrade, schwab, fidelity) the one thing I don't like is you can't trade some low price securities.

Ty, ill take a look at it
That makes sense. You have to have historical data to price the options. Right?
The ministry of magic said do not mention the name -

Another thing I forgot to mention is that you don't *need* to have 100 shares to sell a put.

You can deposit cash into your account and sell a cash covered put.

What that means is that the broker will hold your money until the contract is over.

The amount of money you'd have to pay is the hypothetical max loss. Because the lowest a stock price can go is $0, there is a natural maximum gain or loss.

As for buying puts, you don't need to have the 100 shares to buy a put. If you don't have them, when the option is about to expire, robinhood will automatically sell it to someone else and then you just get the profit.

You can also sell covered calls, but because there is no maximum price a stock can reach, buying a call has potentially infinite room for profit so you don't cover them with cash, you have to have 100 shares to sell a call.

There is also selling on margin, but thats a horrible idea. That's where you sell without actually having the money. Some guy named u/1R0NYMAN used margin to lose tens of thousands.
If you think reading charts = free money you’re just gambling

Jesus Christ I'm sitting here listening to this scammer trying to get me to invest in some fraudulent alt coin. Best way for me to fuck with him.
Winners never quit. Ever seen someone double their money and then say they’re never touching stocks again? No. Only losers quit. It’s only when you’re down 50% of your net worth do you quit. When you’re up you’re on a high and won’t stop until it ends.
Short term gains get taxed as income. Lowest tax rate is 10%, most of yours would be taxed at 12%, depending on credits and deductions.
Congrats retard

If there is one thing that I have learned from this sub.   


It is that a lot of people try to jump on the boat after the ship has left the dock and began to set sail.
They just pulled the plug on a big project and agreed to pay a fine for a fraud cause

Plus it just had an ex-dividend date

Do you ever think that maybe things dip for a reason?
Same bro.  Once it’s touches 61 I’m buying calls tho

I used to work at a hedge fund.  Those people were idiots and it’s defunct now.

Working at a hedge fund ruined finance for me.  I thought I was joining an elite club.  It was just a bunch of nerds who were convinced their strategy was always right despite negative returns.  Definition of a circle jerk.

One time we lost 8% in a day and I kid you not our lead portfolio manager blamed the “trend reversal happening too fast”

Uh yeah, dumbass, Draghi dropped a bombshell and you were in the wrong side of the trade.  Your model was wrong, not the market

Edit:  also yea GME to the moon 🚀🚀
Yeah, don't sweat it. People here make a huge fuss about nothing when it comes to taxes. You make profit, pay taxes. If you make a lot, pay them quarterly to avoid fines. That's it.

Except the new consoles are digital and don't accept disks.

I want to love GME but Microsoft and Sony have very effectively chopped GME out of the cycle. I expect a bump on console sales but the longer term outlook is still kinda shit. Once you no longer even use disks what is Gamestop but a 99 cent store for gaming tchotchkes?

They're literally Blockbuster when Netflix started doing things online. Blockbuster tried to pivot online but pivot to what? Netflix was already buying up all the rights to online content delivery and Blockbuster got shut out. GME is in almost the same exact position, they can't force Sony or MSFT to allow them into their walled garden to sell games.

Much like Blockbuster would have had to spend billions on content I think Gamestop has to literally develop their own console. I don't see how else they get out from this longer term. And the odds GME develops a whole gaming platform are miniscule.

Ex: bet the Packers to beat the Jets.. And don't do a point spread +3/+8 etc...  just bet straight up so all the packers need to do is win, so you win (NFL dorsnt care about point spreads they just want wins look at the Steelers if you need proof)
Bet a morning game
An afternoon game
And an evening game if you want to bet multiple games in a week and take the winnings and roll them into next game

Dont do parlays because you need all of them to hit and the reward isnt really worth the risk

Then they I can't hold it in anymore and I start spewing about central banks, inflation, and how algorithms are brainwashing us (I rarely get another date). 

The trick is to talk about TV shows.

I bought stock at $40, its a good value stock, with recent rotation back into value and out of high growth tech stocks, it could pick up institutional attention and see a pop. For me, it's a good longer term hold, but i'm not going to try to time a pop on it.

I’m still doing my dd on pricing but I think both have potential. Interesting mix because one is helped by a vaccine and the other is hurt. I think the bullish trend on hotels/airlines/casinos/cruises will extend to Airbnb and doordash is an attractive company regardless of any dings they may get from vaccine news (which will be priced from the beginning at this point).

Saw this comment from r/stocks. We're reaching peak euphoria and autism, I'm considering going UVXY or puts tomorrow...

>I’m like you just stared 7 months ago but the difference between you and me is that I’m still trying to catch the up trend of the stock. And I also lost money buying stock which recommended by TikTok and here as well. Now, I’m going to be very careful. I’m going to read more business news from Bloomberg, CNBC and Reuter and company background before I invest. I did very well when I inquire the shit out of companies and invest. Other thing I have to watch myself is my compulsive behavior and also trying to take Chance of meme stocks. I have almost $10k of stocks that are looks like worthless 😔 bought them in greed now pian in my ass.. I’m also watching how people post here and interact here.I find few people are here bullying and intimidating

So I've been doing a pretty bad job of researching this, but say I'm leveraged on a LEAP that's up at year end, so I want to place a protective put to make sure I don't have a loss next year. If I'm still above my put when I decide to sell, I can obviously unwind the position any way I want, but what is the strategy for when you fall below your put near expiration?

You can call and negotiate margin rates esp if you're over 500k which it looks like you are. I'm technically in the 7.5% margin rate as well but I negotiated it down to 6.6% and 5.1% when I hit 75k in margin.

You think Uber treats their drivers like slaves? Well yeah maybe they do. But anyway my point: You seen what DoorDash pays its drivers per delivery assuming no customer tip? They literally lose money because the penny DD throws at them to deliver shitty food to some scummy neighborhood sure as hell won’t cover their expenses for gas and car maintenance, not to mention increased risk of getting into car accidents and shit like that. I mean I love the concept of a third party service to deliver food from places that wouldn’t offer it themselves but DD is trash. 

Wait why am I actually talking about a company realistically sorry wrong subreddit umm calls on TSLA and PLTR reeeeee
Yeah, but let’s be real. What percentage of people on here actually bought in under $20?

Edit: Of course now everyone that bought in slightly below $20 feels the needs to reply to my comment, completely missing the point. Just look up all of the loss posts from the last week.

Anyone heard of EXRO?

Exro's advanced control technology, the Coil Driver, expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains by improving performance, efficiency, and reducing costs. Exro currently has 17 granted patents and 18 patents pending on its innovative technology. May be the next big thing in the next 2 years.

In retrospect it probably sounded like I was having a stroke.
I hope not, I'm trying to grab some tmrw at open
It's so easy to read what you autists are buying into and then just sell way OTM calls because that's all you can afford to get.

You must have no idea how bankruptcy works.....
Do some reading into Detroit and its bankruptcy a few years ago. It's actually thriving as a city and all of the bad debt is cleared. Chicago is basically Terri Chiavo right now, and the Democrats want the Feds to keep paying to keep it on life support so the unions and politicians who got it into so much trouble don't have to make any difficult decisions to fix the mess they created. That's absolute bullshit.
risky
So is NIO fucked since Asia is down?
I love TSM. I have some 01/15 $110 calls.

TSM 1h chart has been in this channel since the end of October. Aside from the channel, it has consistently run from nearly oversold (RSI below 40 in this case) to overbought (RSI over 70) and, had you purchased it every time it was under 40 and sold every time it was over 70, you would’ve made money.  


*chart here* [*https://imgur.com/a/oTf9hOR*](https://imgur.com/a/oTf9hOR)

White lines indicate the channel  
Yellow vertical line indicates RSI under 40  
Blue vertical line indicates RSI over 70

If you just focus on the area between the yellow and blue lines, you’ll see the move up you would’ve caught by following this pattern. Will it continue?

*note: it is correct that there’s an area of two yellow lines before the next blue; it dipped twice before reaching overbought so, since it stayed in the channel, you could’ve bought both dips*

Other notes for TSM:

\+ RSI currently at 66 so we have a chance to wait for the sub 40 RSI dip tomorrow

\+ TSM is in a long term uptrend

\- The 4 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts have a median target of 79.75. The median estimate represents a -23.13% decrease from the last price of 103.75.  


I suppose another option could be to buy every dip below 40 RSI as long as it stays within the channel.

Well, taxes are easy for the most part unless you're doing something with an estate. The 1040s were redone under Trump ( strangely one thing I absolutely think was a really great idea ) so yeah, they are way easier than they used to be, but Sched D and E are still somewhat unfriendly.

I mean if you go by what you said before, the peaks / highs are only there in hindsight. Are these returns not only known in hindsight too? I Mean how weird does it feel to buy SPY at close then sell at a loss on open, then buy for a higher price at close and trust that statistically you are better off doing this?
Not.
They don't have to only show their own, but could just prefer their own, and not show ones they want to blackball. They can limit the run for other movies when their blockbusters come out too. 

Disney has Fox now too, they make a good percentage of films if you weight it by each films gross movie sales, Wich Is what you would consider if your looking at profitablity.

If Dis owns AMC, and WB owns Regal, they could only show each other's movies and freeze out everyone else, all indies, etc. Would disappear. Except for streaming releases.
I believe that's the joke

This is super enlightening OP, thanks for posting these. It’s helpful that you’ve also started posting the open and close prices, and non-weeklies. Thank you, keep up the good work!
I want to win and see everyone lose. And then I come up with a great idea to help them so when they succeed I can say “I told ya so”. And then we can all be “friends” but they know who’s really in charge ;)

I make most of my money buying spy calls before close and selling in the AM. 85% of the time, it beats the meme stocks y’all pump here. Not worried about it tho I pulled out Friday with gains to avoid holding through the weekend.

You can literally just sell covered calls. 7 calls at 25$ would give you 136 in 3 weeks. If you wanted to be more risky. You could do 22$ calls for 50$ each and get 350$
would make total sense if i knew they were buying stripe and I could unload on retail investors for guaranteed gains

A tale as old as time. spy calls are correct 9/10 times. A spy put is pure chance for some bad news to exist to make them print, so unless you are in a position to start nuclear Armageddon you are just gambling with puts.

What’s your PT? Seems a bit high for a SPAC
It is. People in New-York do live very f***g interesting lives, and they go bankrupt faster or not sooner if not less easily because the Useless, Inconnu-brucibles who have gotten fat by being forced to live high and without worry of a day coming of when an honest business woman's kids could take what ever-one gives (including me! My only baby I think had less food before being brought down because I had no insurance!), as if anyone can live without any protection and never learn to ask and/you, never need fear anyone from doing one!

Government probably will bail them out
No, not really.  You're buying at market price at close and selling at market price at open.  The only "timing" is relying on ... I guess you might call it a statistical assumption that over a sufficient time frame you will tend to catch more of the gains in the overall index.

Interesting.  If $130 id cry tears of joy haha
🥱 green by open.
I think it can, I’ve got 100 shares at 19.60 and looking to add some leaps. It’s a good stock for wheeling atm
Is Burry short TSLA since September?
Step 1 is start off with more optimism. “I got a k I’m looking to double.” Or something like that lol.
Even by wsb standards this is fucking retarded how concerned everyone is at quarter of a % down.

The markets been fucking volatile as shit, this is absolutely fucking nothing
BB is in a lot of cars. Something like 160 million or something. There’s definitely a future

This is by far the best meme in this sub. Thank you 🥲
This made me laugh more than you think
The easiest and safest way to be a millionaire is working hard and long APPL every paycheck.

tech is the only future and APPL is at the top. they will never fail. I strongly believe tech industry will devour entire wealth of every single nation. To survive in the future, you should work in tech industry or having their shares a lot.

For real, people here acting like .25% is note worthy.
Then, there’s no doubt.

tbh upside to 22-23 max
Bulls don't want a gap up anyway, cause you know it'll get filled during RTH
Started buying BB 5 years ago believing the turnaround had happened.  Got in at $13 and then $7 pretty heavy, rode the train down to its low and pretty much went all in at $4 and $5 and im glad I did.....im a believer.  Have 1490 shares now, thinking about doubling down again.  Also have that new phone coming out in 2021, they have a deal with a Texas startup OnwardMobility.  Idk if the phone will be a success but it will get their name out in front of the public again.
SPACs love a hot market. Just watch them dive back to their initial offering price if markets get hit

Right I said probably. She has turned it into a public fight and said it harms the funds. But ultimately the contracts say it’s not in her control anymore so she is going to lose the fight

Cue 3 months of waiting for it to fall below the price I called the "top".

I make about 1/2 what you make. To me, it sounds like you're set you just don't realize it yet. Granted this is a surface level conclusion seeing how we don't know one another. 


If I was in your position financially, I would throw that 1 mil into a NNN leased commercial property. The ones in my area cost ~1-1.5m and you'd see 100-150k annually in rent. Since it's a NNN, you don't pay for the real estate taxes, insurance, repairs, updates, etc. 


Try to relax a bit, you're doing incredibly well. Hell, my entire goal of retiring young would be achieved by reaching what you've already got. Think about that. 


Or, you know, go full retard and throw 1 mil into GME tomorrow. It would sure help my position out if you managed to trigger that short squeeze for us autists.

It is showing an RSI of 85 which means its very overbought. However, the news came only today about the most recent success. So, it looks like it could have a couple days of further running up but could then come down given such a high RSI. Do you think it is too late to buy shares? Or do you think this thing is going to run up for a while more?
Puts on either

I think anything that leaves the already precarious economy in worse shape will be seen as sour grapes from the outgoing administration and not given nearly the same level of credibility by the Chinese.

If Vaccine is good then I think Cruise will sail again by Summer 2021 but I think NCLH will get to $30 before end of this year because of Vaccine news. 

Obama and Fauci will be one of the first big guy that's willing to take vaccine and Obama will take it on Live-TV so I think the Vaccine news will boost the Travel stock overall.

Yeah the $31 billion valuation was their Series F and was reached by September 2016 so all I’m saying is it has been flat for a while cause they didn’t raise new capital except the emergency round for almost five years since they print money

Compare to Uber and others which were pumped to nearly $100 billion with a bunch of late stage rounds when they were initially similar in valuation.

Uber has also gone up a lot since IPO but the bankers took a lot more for themselves and the investors. Airbnb has been growing for years without an upward valuation revision so it doesn’t surprise me there would be a substantial one.

The objective of both sides of the strategy is to receive continuous premiums from the contracts you’re selling, whether it be from covered calls or cash secured puts. The reason why we go back and forth is because when your CC gets exercised, you’re in prime position to sell CSP and vice versa when your CSP get assigned.

What happened in Japan?
It’s up 65% in a month and they just had to push back cruises until March earliest. Starting to look like very few if any cruises for summer 2021 which is their best time of year. There’s a reason RCL announced they’re raising more capital on Friday... it’s a grab for enough cash to bridge to 2022 cause 2021 is about to get revised downwards by the analysts
I would consider that route if i wasn’t in snow country. My 2010 corolla is rusting out. If i got something that old it would start rusting any day now if it isn’t already

Their highest valuation was 31B in 2017. Just interesting to see how quickly their valuation rebounded in a few months for us retails will likely open much higher
that is not how this works... "what they have told me"... you really think people will buy into a business like UPS now, given the pandemic will end sooner than later and things will go back to "normal" then you don't understand that a stock implies the winnings for years to come usually...

Follow up to this: is there a service that lets you look at how a stock performs on a day-by-day basis?

XPEV could have an interesting dip or breakout buy tomorrow as it seems to be wedging out of its recent beatdown.

Dip zone 48.70 - 47. Breakout above the top blue trend line \~50 - 51. Tight cut loss of 45.75. Chart shown is the 30m chart, *here* [*https://imgur.com/a/cmpnM7a*](https://imgur.com/a/cmpnM7a)

Other considerations:

\+ RSI @ 41

\+ In a long term uptrend

\+/- MACD not sending a clear signal yet

\- Analysts' average price target is $40.67 ▼ (-17.57% Downside)

A bit of a mixed bag but, if it breaks and holds, it could have a good run.

Don't forget, tax will kill retail traders, since you're taxed on all gains, and likely you'll violate wash sales rule year-round. 

Do it in Roth or 401k.

If you think that's for sure gonna happen not gonna change your opinion but you can Google the axios article and it'll give you more context.

Why Asian Future down, You No Love Me No More?
Westport fuel systems CNG RNG engines with Cummins are carbon zero emmisions and save 30% vs diesel. Hyln has ~no savings vs diesel and the range is overstated and at best matches the range of a diesel or CNG RNG engine. Rather than use RNG CNG to charge a 800 battery in a truck one can simply use the RNG CNG to power a more efficient engine without a 800Lb battery weight, costs and be further ahead. This is what Europe is doing and that is more likely to be the disruptor towards the trucking industry. CNG RNG engines. Not CNG RNG powering an electric drivetrain. This isnt popular on this board but don't buy the hype and PowerPoint self promo presentations. Tom Healy ceo of deflategate science and previous venture making a football helmet?? Not an electrical engineer nor CEO with any Ed experience or expertise in this sector. Serial entrepreneur. Fabricated savings for erx that were not true in road testing. Last q results showed no contracts no sales despite projections and promotions of sales. Only sales to an equity owner of Hyln itself. Not authentic.

So cool how the buy the close, sell the open strategy totally matches the S&P historical price.
It doesn’t matter, ABNB has that SNOW and U retard strength

Anyway using an acquisition corp doesn’t necessarily solve the problem. They need to convince the company not to IPO by offering a convincingly high price per share. It’s easy to blame the IPO but the fact is something with high demand is going to go up in the dealmaking stage regardless
Rotting on McConnell's desk.

It is going to start burning extrinsic value real hard. I usually try to roll out at about 3-4 weeks before expiration if I still want to stay in the play.  The last two weeks are a big play on gamma but that can go either way, while the theta burns negative for sure.
This is really, really bad news. 

If options become overweighted derivatives that will cause all sorts of defaults and wild IV swings that can't be predicted. It'll fuck everyone. I mean everyone. Institutions and retail.

I just wonder where the breaking point is.
Neither should ever be the move until another cruise takes off... I say that as a shareholder. I don’t trust the cruise line market right now. Should go down, only goes up. Don’t get pissed when it does go down.
Homie ate that slap. PLTR STRONG
It literally doesn't matter but the more memey the stock, the better, as you will have higher volatility....You know.... Due to the retardedness of everyone here.
Its a minimum of 5 days with other exceptions like share price anount of shares publicly traded etc so its not as cut and dry as that-and definitely not an option after 3 days, but you let me know how those abnb options are doing next Tuesday lol
Only if you pay for that shit. I think most give the last 4 for free though you can google it.
They both just got a shit ton of cash. Should be able to last at least till 2021. If Covid is still as strong then, then both might face bankruptcy

Yup.
If you compare Airbnb over 2015-2019 to Booking over 2009-2013, the two almost match up exactly in terms of gross bookings volume (or in other words, scale).

Despite that, over these respective time periods, Booking raked in over $21 billion in profits, while Airbnb recorded an aggregate net loss of over $820 million.

This suggests there may be a potentially structural difference in operating leverage between Airbnb and OTAs like Booking.

As you and your wife peer into the baby monitor, you both start laughing. Your daughter--in her war against sleep--is having a conversation with the stuffed animal lamb you gave her. The conversation is nonsense, of course, but sounds very intense.

Suddenly, your wife kisses you hard on the mouth. Your teeth click, and you can taste the red wine on her tongue. She wants number two, and so do you. But you push her away. "Just a second." She moans, in exaggerated frustration, but smiles sideways at you as you slip into the bathroom.

From the toilet you open Futures. And feel yourself go limp. She calls to you. "What's taking so long?" She calls to you. Like you called the market. You don't answer her, just like the market didn't answer you.

If GYNA is down 1.6 already...hold onto ur butts re: S&P
Is this shares or atm options?
Are you sure about that? If I own stock and sell a call against it, and my shares get called away, meaning the option possibly made the buyer money, I lost nothing. The buyer hasn't lost either.

Op?
From what I've read and after listening to their most recent earnings call, it seems they are looking for a buyout rn....looking to sell so that they can scale is what it seems to me. Just brought on an old Ford exec to the board last week. Could see a huge run up in stock price in the coming weeks leading up to their automotive lidar demo in April
So who is fuk??
Trump is trying so hard to still seem relevant, it’s kinda sad tbh
Why do you think they went IPO? 

Because retards will throw money at everything that remotely resembles the word “tech”. 


It’s a fucking platform as a service in “real estate / hospitality”. God boomers are just as retarded.

Do both. Take ten percent and go full cowboy wsb. There is actually genius in what wsb is doing from the perspective of fat tails and assymetries. And have another larger portion to index funds. But even index funds isn't as obvious as the "research" makes it out to be. You need to be comfortable which country /sector/style will do well and be around for a long time. 
It's the same with any big debate, the truth is always in the middle. This nutrition, politics, ect.
Oooffff my 3 weeklys are dead.... wish I gave up two weeks ago during the small pump :/
I did that but I skipped the +30k step. So you are at least one notch above me, fellow retard
But in Asia red candles mean profit. Right? Right?
Agreed. The lockdown end is just on the horizon. No one should be selling knowing that things are gonna go back to normal given a few months time. We just need to hold out a little while longer.
Couldn’t you do this on something like TQQQ and make out pretty well?
U better hedge bud
Friday night I comment some shit about fuck commies, big upvotes

Sunday night I comment the same shit (because futes drilling is communist) big downvoted

Sunday’s are communist confirmed
Asia fucking imploding.

Would you buy this dip on the Chinese EVs? NIO and XPEV are legit hitters in China with production and deliveries. Entering the european market soon too. You think this past week's selloff was a correction or actual fears concerning risk of delisting from investors? Any thoughts on their future?
Real picks don’t need a fake pump.
DoorDash- we still haven’t the slightest idea of how they are profitable
=$90/share

PLTR- fat government contracts, big data, Minority Report type software when civil crime at all time high
=$25/share

STONKS. 🤨
Would be interested in the data.

For that matter, am interested in being the counterparty in each of those trades 😜
Why china dumping? And why’s baba so red over there? Don’t mind buying puts, just wondering why
I'm not selling until it reaches $120 per share.
I mean if it works on ferrets...right?

Don't worry. They won't even be entitled to a roof over their head after I mortgage my house and buy NIO calls with the money.
Panik is coming from Hang Seng being down 1.5
356 or 352. 358 was nothing.
Big question is can they take us there soon so I can dump these calls and buy more GME shares
Down 2.5% in Chinese market rn
Screw fang. SPACs are the new money makers
It will be an even better buy next week.
Puts?
Let me hold a dolla
Those have actually been a lot higher a week ago when it was 606 and still had more theta
Knowing TSLA, I say 615 by open, 650 by EOD . Bears shall prepare their buttholes 🥸
just sold this on friday but might re-do it for 12/18 ... i feel like it might get choppy first
u/uberkikz11 does indeed show up from time to time.

Both are stealing jobs... obviously.

Americans were more than willing to work those jobs for decades. They just aren't willing to work them for dirt cheap, which is the whole point of outsourcing/immigration to begin with.

The upvote bubble is bursting here, historically there's been way more upvotes than downvotes even though a large percentage of the sub is capable of both upvoting and downvoting. It's not that we're in a downvote market but an upvote pullback was more than due, so be careful here.
Agree on principal. Definitely try to bank profits right when WSB starts. But I think underlying factors make this a different story. We'll see

That's right. But again there's a distinction between short-term tax (holding for 365 or fewer days) and long-term (holding for 366 or more days) tax. So do the same calculation but now with a higher tax rate and see how it's even more different. There's the added bonus of the first \~$40,000 of long-term capital gains being tax-free, not something you get with short-term capital gains.

Good tables here: [investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp](https://investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

Call are pretty much almost free money.  Just scroll down the option chain of the options with the nearest expiration date until you get to the cheapest call that still has a bid.  Invest 100% of your capital and you will get around a 1000% return within a few days pretty much guaranteed.

Customer service: you can call your bank when you have a problem and it will be your banker that answers the phone and handles the problem for you.  Companies like stripe and square use call centers which is a huge turn off for business owners.  

We also offer perks such as free premium accounts and offer other products (lending/treasury) at discounts or even are more lenient on a businesses lending limit when they have other relationships with the bank.

It may seem like these products are better and I have lost customers to them but they typically will come back to us after a year or so with horror stories of these companies

Actually your reason is why imo you want to take advantage it here. Under normal circumstances the implied move would be half of what it is, in which I wouldn't want to sell these calls. But in this circumstance, because of what everyone is expecting, I would rather sell calls (since MM will be more likely to inverse - after all they sell a bunch of these calls and their goal is to make money too). I would wait very last moment on Tuesday to do so though. The higher IV is caused by this short squeeze expectation which I don't think will be 30% this week.

So that debunks my wild speculation. A fellow redditor in another thread brought to my attention that sometimes when private companies get too big, they hire these positions for private investors anyway.

OP more good news coming for us AMC bears. SoCal cinemas are closed for weeks and an insider told me DIS is expected to announce their own 2020 release plans similar to Warner Bros at this week’s investor day. DIS has about 70% of the box office market share  and has everything to gain by an AMC bankruptcy. Mickey don’t like AMC taking 50% of box office sales when he’s got to pay all the marketing costs. Many options but the most likely is the mouse can pick up  a handful of AMC’s choicest properties in major cities and begin Disney Theater Experience in 2022. DIS absolutely does not want all 620 - oops 618 now after recent Ohio and TX permanent closures- AMC locations.

Bulls r fuk
Damn, is this real?
That’s got a lot of extrinsic value, meaning it’s getting value from potential to go higher than $10.9. If you think it’ll continue growing higher by 12/18, you’ll start losing that extrinsic value and starting having intrinsic value, the value the strike is under the market.  
So to sum it up, if it stagnates until 12/18, you’re losing money. If it continues going up, you’re making money. If it drops, see ya.  
I would sell but up to you.
Downvotes came from Michael bay fans.

Evening, boys. Bear or bull let’s all make some fucking money before the end of the year. That’s the name of the fucking game.
Was waiting for the PLTR call meme massacre to jump in thanks for the buy indicator.
Not exactly, Vega is the change in price of the contract due to iv. The Greeks tell u how the price of the options moves. 


Imagine it as the other person when you buy a call. If you buy a call and the stock moves up, then your call’s value increases, someone is receiving your premium (the seller of the call) and their value just decreased, so they can close the option (sell to another call seller) but at a lower price than they bought in at. 

If the stock price falls again just before expiry and your call option expires worthless then you lose your whole premium to the seller anyway, as the premium always approaches zero at expiry at a constant stock price. 

Just smoked a bowl so I hope this makes a little sense, but if you’re asking because you’re interested in selling covered calls or secured puts, the best way to see how it works is to try it out either paper trading or just with a penny stock. It’s easier to see how the options price moves with underlying stock that way.

And rewriting history to say nobody eats bats there while simultaneously saying the wet market bats were the source of the coronavirus?

Just reading the top posts from r/stocks and r/investing is screaming peak euphoria to me.

Until June 2022 at least. Unless you hear about a covid 20
Pretty good imo, tries to be too deep at times. The villain is also distractingly ugly at some points but I guess that was intentional. I prefer the original anti western movie, high plains drifter.
Absolutely phenomenal movie. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.

Can anyone explained whine TRNE is mooning? I saw a filing about lawsuits, but that sounded bad. Not that I'm complaining.

You read the comment you are responding to until you figure it out
How stupid would it be to scan for stocks that went up at least 6% the previous day then buy aggressive calls on whatever one I am most confident in continuing the trend?
It's not this week that you should be thinking about. It's the next few months. And it's shares, not calls.

I'm not even that much of a Star Wars fan myself, I've seen all the original movies and the 2nd trilogy but I think I've seen 1/3 of the newest trilogy. Definitely dont need a solid foundation of lore for the Mandolarian. Theres a lot of rich star wars lore and Easter eggs hidden about the series but you dont need to know jack squat about any of that to enjoy this show.
Honestly it was worth the hundreds of dollars I lost on PLTR just to feel included in the memes
I really liked this at first but they have some red flags.  GHI V and IPO C look safer to me.  Still contemplating all three although started buying up GHI V last week.

Nobody put in pre bids. Just buy once it goes live. When bids get put in the algos knows their is high demand and raise the stock price before it starts trading.

Dude that’s not at all how it works. If you want to import them you have to pay them more to justify hiring over a domestic candidate. Companies cannot find the talent domestically. It’s that simple. There’s like 15 roles for every engineer. They’re not all equal and they’re not all convenient, but they’re there. 

And I didn’t just work with established clients, I left that side to work with middle market and lower middle market clients also. The opportunity is there. Not sure where you live, but you may have to move to make it happen dude

Edit: and making a killing is the opposite of 10/hr. They’re not stealing jobs any more than Hispanic laborers are. Simply put most Americans don’t want to work construction/landscaping or tech jobs so people who will work them come to fill the void. It’s pure play capitalism at work.

>Major healthcare systems just would not go for that. EVen assuming their tech is both cost-effective and non-inferior, their proposal disrupts (not in a good way) too many things simultaneously (radiologists' and technologists' workflow, reimbursement, existing vendors etc.)

I'm not sure about that. Healthcare systems are a business at the end of the day. Spending up to $1 million to buy a system vs getting a Nanox setup for free seems like a no brainer assuming that it works even if their is resistance from staff. Even with bailouts/etc health care systems took major financial hits during the pandemic and will take a while for recovery. It would be fiscally irresponsible not to evaluate if it doesn't work.  
This also doesn't take into account all the urgent care facilities that might jump at this as a chance for additional revenue source.  


I do agree with your point on more publications/papers though. I think they need to show more. Haven't they published on this tech though via the team at University of Tokyo?

Ok I just understood it. When you pay 20% tax on gains each year, a 10% annual return becomes an 8% annual return. That’s worse than taking 20% off a 10% annual return at the end.

In sheets I just calculated that if you start w/ 100k and buy/sell effectively reducing a 10% return to an 8% return, you have 931,727 after 30 yrs. If you start with the same and grow 10% annually, then take 20% off at the end, you have 1,269,047.

These ppl are funny I just had a learning moment and they’re downvoting me

If you are buying to hold wait a week or two for the price shake out, SNOW is way up. I think AirBnB is going to have time before the virus is almost over and summer is coming. Then people are going to go buck wild on vacation and it will print hard.

First of all, you are working with established companies/clients. That's why I put it in quotes. You have no idea what the market is like for 90% of new STEM graduates. If you even glanced at the statistics you would know.

Second, you admit yourself:

\>they \[Indians\] make a fucking killing. 

\> There is a reason they’re demographically becoming one of the wealthiest immigrant communities 

So you just affirmed my point that they are stealing American jobs, regardless of their income specifics.

At least you admit as much. Most won't even go that far. There is a reason real wages have been declining in the US for decades, and that reason is globalization, the entire point of which is to UNDERCUT American labor.

Not sure why you’re getting downvoted b/c that makes sense. Also, it’s being driven down for that exact purpose. Can confirm also, RKT is a pretty great company. Anyone who thinks it’s just mortgages has absolutely no idea how many children companies it owns - fuck, they even partnered with Vroom for selling cars and made a killing this year doing it.

Rumors will pump a stock and then when the news comes out the stock will come back down to where it should have been. So say a stock starts at 100, rumors come out and it moves to 110, news actually comes out it corrects back to 105. Still up from the original but it looks like it went down from the news.
It was a real thing until fairly recently.

Me too man. But how can you pump a SPAC is what I’m thinking. Sure, they could have bought at 22 or 23 and are trying to pump to $30 pre announcement, but that’s at best. This is a stonk that won’t soar aka get pumped until the company is known. So I’m worried about these pump posts, but not that worried. Because I believe in Bill’s eyebrows.
What market signals are you seeing that indicate now is a good time to be aggressive?

I'm depressed af again. The market and this sub has been the only interest I've had for months now and was helping to keep me going. I no longer care about any of it in the slightest bit even though this shit has been a passion. Converting my last few positions to cash tomorrow because I can't even be bothered to watch them anymore.

I didn't wanna go out like this. If I lost it all on some bad plays.. then that's life, but fuck guys, not like this. Sorry to kill the mood, but I've loved this sub and posting here. Praying that things turn around for me soon, but idk.

Hope you boys go straight to the moon this week

any brokerages won’t have access to abnb ipo?
 Airbnb [**ABNB,** **-3.41%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/ABNB?countryCode=CH&mod=MW_story_quote) is boosting the range to between $56 and $60 a share, from $44 to $50, people familiar with the matter said. The new range would give the home-rental company a valuation of as much as $42 billion on a fully diluted basis.
If you ever feel like you are making terrible plays, know that there are still idiots "buying the dip" on NKLA since $94
I feel it has no meme potential as everyone understands what Airbnb does, the CEO and other executives are less interesting than a loaf of white bread, and it’s business model isn’t retarded enough for this sub.

This market has me nervous. I feel like there should be some back and filling toward 12000 but also that everyone is waiting on lower prices to pile in in advance of a EOY santa rally. The 4 consecutive  small daily ranges while price presses to new all time world record highs is weird too.

That figure is arguably marginal considering the time and effort cost over 27 years. One big positive is that you could manage the trades to miss some huge red days during a sell off. Taking a 3 week break in Feb then buying back again would create some huge gains for 2020 using this

Expect it to dip after earnings. Many stocks dip after earning even when it's good news.

You should see that as an opportunity to buy more shares at a discount.

okay im convinced
I'm not sure I follow. An investment will be exponentially larger in 30 years than in 2 years. In terms of taxes they'll both be taxed at (roughly) 20%. But I'd rather keep 80% of a bigger pie.

Best way to go is create a Google Sheet with columns for investment value, capital gain, and tax rate. Watch how it can compound from year to year whether your sell or let it grow. Also notice how much tax if paid.

Supply chain issues. They have huge demand right now (so really I’m very bullish on GNRC), but they are months out for delivering products.

Also, looking at the daily charts you see some upside down hammers where the price tried to run up, but it had no momentum. 

We might get a little run up tomorrow, but it’s heading down to around 195 is my guess. 

After they fall far enough I’m getting right back into calls though.

If that's the case, I wouldn't look at any BMW with forced induction. You're going to be looking at more maintenance costs if you're racking up high mileage. If you absolutely must go BMW, consider a 328 or similar non-turbocharged model with a simpler powetrain.

That said, I'm an Audi guy and can tell you that the only way to survive is to lease and/or have a warranty, or do you DD on the chassis/engine/powertrain to know what maintenance red flags might be around. (This goes for all German or lux brands.) It's not impossible to wrench yourself, but that requires space, time and desire to learn how (or experience), and slightly less money than going to the dealership/specialty shop.

**tl;dr**: High mileage daily driver? Get reliable, boring-ass a Civic and sleep easier.

 Just coded the DIX as an indicator on tradingview. My god was it a pain in the ass. Script took a fuckin week.

Getting some really good stuff out of it though. The TA capabilities are night and day. Still trying to decide on the best method for visualization.

Any input would be appreciated; throw this an upvote or comment if you’d be interested in such an indi, also. I’ll definitely publish and share in here if there’s interest.

I know multiple people at those firms. UT Austin is a top 10 engineering program, ranked higher than some Ivy League ones. Plenty of engineers start their careers at those firms. STEM grads from smaller regional schools are at a disadvantage.
Futures don’t matter especially when it’s close to neutral

>trading calls on it doesnt affect the company one way or the other 

Not true. When MMs sell a lot of calls they hedge by going long shares. All the FDs WSB bought drove the price up
If you love stress, by all means yolo into pltr.
On the other hand, if stress is not your forte, safer, slower gains in index are the way to go.

This is actually good play. Most people here are just used to buying after the stock is up 50%. Is there any way to know if most warrants have been exercised? I’m guessing the price should stabilize as we near December 30th, I think warrant holders have until this day to exercise? Very interested in long term calls if IV dips
That’s how I feel pretty much

I know that’s how it sounds at first read, but you have no idea how little we have been living with and on.

I save about 80% of my take home pay, average about $60k/yr in gains over the last few years on top of my salary, and have two commercial properties that we own (that so far have been paying for themselves, but not throwing off any cash for us).

Some real life FIRE shit going on.

We live with my wife’s parents, have a reasonable car (okayish suv, $35k cost with 0% loan), and other than gambling on wsb shit my only other vice is a high end mac every few years.

I’ve got literally a million dollars, and it’s fucked up that I’m so anxious and worried about my future.

It's a stretch because it contradicts not only my personal knowledge but the actual statistics showing a huge percentage, and rising, of STEM graduates are either unemployed or underemployed. I just doubt you know a single person working at all those companies you named. NASA, Google, Apple?

I’ll put my money on Cinemark. AMC has less cash in hand than Cinemark. If AMC bankrupts, Cinemark is in prime position to grab those cinemas at a steal. And AMC is the only cinema being vocal about Warner Bros putting WW84 on HBO Max. I would definitely start looking into investing in streaming, it is here to stay, I’m thinking of buying Disney and Netflix long term.

You’re a liar. I do know what I’m talking about. I work in tech advisory. I also used to work in tech consulting financial management. Meaning, I was personally responsible for the financial analysis, productivity analysis, and hiring packages for tech consultants, engineers, developers, etc. on over a quarter billion in tech project work. 

I can say with 100% certainty that you are either a total fucking liar or you and your friend are complete idiots. If you truly have a stem masters and you’re working blue collar, it’s something that’s wrong with you, not the workforce or recruiting. 

As for the Indians you’re trying to characterize as cheap labor thieves, they make a fucking killing. If you knew anything about H1-b recruiting you’d know they don’t come cheap anymore, especially with graduate level certs. There is a reason they’re demographically becoming one of the wealthiest immigrant communities and it’s not because they work for 10 bucks an hour. Get a fucking grip and stop talking like a labor cuck. If you keep lying to yourself or stroking your emotional boner, your opportunity to get your career on track will pass you by. Good luck.

December 2018 Tesla was trading above $370. 370x2=740 his contracts were for 680. I totally understand your skepticism but these contracts existed, I saw them myself because i looked right at them and asked who in their right mind would buy $600 LEAPS on Tesla? I remember these contracts because earlier in the year JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley came out and said Tesla could see it stock drop to $10, so I looked at LEAP puts and calls. 
Im not saying this guy is legit, I have no clue but what i do know is that these LEAPS were available, and higher, when he claims to have bought them.

personally hoping it melts tomorrow (puts), but it's a good long term play if it dips. Just be careful for the lockup period expiring on the 14th
I think the compounding effect cancels out tho. Because in a buy and hold scenario tax grows exponentially and so does untaxed value. In a case where you buy and sell instantaneously every two years and thus pay tax every two years example, your untaxed value stays untouched and grows at the same rate. The other commenter brings up a good point which is that short term tax is larger than long term. But i want to say this is the only difference

You have no idea what you are talking about. And I don't need to tell some stranger on the internet my entire life story, or the story of the other guys I know with BA/MA in STEM.

Ask literally any millennial with a degree. 90% of them have the same story.
Stripe may not need funding, but 10 years is about the magic number for a company to be around without employees having liquid equity.  Uber, DropBox, Pinterest, and many other unicorns went public by that time or soon after.  Stripe apparently also isn't listed on secondary markets, and even if they were, private valuations have an illiquidity discount.  Enough of their employees have got to be getting to the point where they're buying homes or starting families and want the other half of their compensation to be usable.  I work at a different unicorn startup and once the business is mature and close to profitable I think there would be a revolt if we didn't go public.

Also, the Collisons say that funding and valuation is just a secondary consideration at this point and they are focused on growth and the product.  Well, if that's the case, going public via SPAC seems ideal, since they don't need to worry about getting distracted by the IPO process, and don't need to issue much float.

Where did you go to school? I went to a state engineering school and all/most of my peers are in STEM for F500 companies. 

Quite a few were hired at Google, Exxon, NASA, Boeing, Lockheed, Tesla, Apple, etc.

Those who did not do STEM careers usually landed high level analyst or finance jobs.

As a fan of evil companies crispr is right up my alley. I usually wouldn’t trust some finance douchebag with a foot fetish (pretty sure that’s what you said) but I’ll get some calls
Narrator: It isn’t.
How many stocks can there really be?  Can’t we just buy way OTM calls on all of them?
Shhhhhhh... don't tell them.

I think so to be honest. $50k is on Amazon calls that don’t expire until Jan and feb. the rest is on random mostly Jan expirations.
What’d you do in the military
I'm up 30% on PRPL shares and went in way too long (was reading your DDs for sometime before I decided to buy in). Kinda the same for PSTH. Have been in and out about getting it since \~21.

I think I will go for another ride with you good sir.
oh, I see; you're not fond of commas. in any event, the point has nothing to do with monetary policy. regulators completely turn a blind eye to the massive amount of dirty money flowing through the banking sector because were they to attempt to put an end to it the entire banking system would suffer an immediate top down collapse

This dude is a liar don’t listen to him. Legit he’s making it all up. Anyone in tech or who works in tech advisory can tell you straight away he’s a liar. Also you don’t have to code to be in tech. There’s more than just development. With that said, learn to code anyways. Doesn’t have to be your life but you should functionally understand it if you don’t want to be useless. You have the time to learn it casually at your age too
I was promised $100 by EOY...

People like weird shit. You might be hot to a solid 10 just because you have features they like. Keep fishin it’s a game of patience sometimes.
I’m more of the smart money vs hardworking type and it’s not because I’m lazy. Worked landscaping for two years, factory job for a year, and construction for a year and I’m 19. I made $750/week in construction working 12 hour days, which was cool until I found out I could press a few buttons on the stock market and make $2,400 in 30 minutes
So you're going to hold those losses until next year, right?

So I tested Airbnb right just now (Am in China, 3rd tier city), the nearest rental is an hour away from me, and the price is way more than the local hotel.
At what point do you just give up on trying to make friends or have people you connect with outside of family? Because I am getting tired AF of initiating with all my friends just to be continually ignored and ghosted. I'm at the point where I'm just not gonna bother with anyone anymore. People fucking suck.

Lol. You are so thin-skinned it's hilarious. I have nothing against TSLA investors and I'm not an SPY VOO guy. And I love Musk. Wish I could invest in SpaceX. But you can't tolerate anyone questioning TSLA valuation. And you haven't bothered trying to justify it in any way. Good luck making millions off something that has already had one of the most ridiculous runs in stock market history. 

BTW I already didn't make millions on TSLA and am totally fine with that. I bought and sold 5 days later ($55,000 worth) in 2017 to make $1,600 in my 401k. If I held it would be $600,000 today and would put my net worth well over 1M. 

Guess how much sleep I've lost over it.
I'm long on RKT too but what do you mean they have good support on 20. They had it, they broke it on Friday.

So what you’re saying is you don’t have a STEM masters and you don’t work in tech, is that right? Otherwise you would’ve just said what degree you have instead of spewing all those lies.

Edit: the only way your job got outsourced to India for tech with a masters is if you got a masters in call center support and consider that a STEM degree

I 'm not sure what you are missing, but I think it might be Compound interest.  Like, the tax man is going to eat a % of each years returns in April if you are  us and October if you are orange.  Now, the deal with this is that assuming you don't pay taxes until 30 years from now you have grown on the tax paid over the same period. So Why you may pay mover over all, you have also been gaining more over all  and in a compound manner which means you should net more in the second scenario.

I think you mean “ poor mans covered call”. You should be able to sell a closer dated call with higher strike. May be it’s not allowing you to sell against it because you have a working sell order of your current long call.

yep, this is the top for sure. im thinking the vaccine will trigger a mass sell and people pulling their money out of the market. a vaccine will mean it is safe to once again use your money and people will yank their money out of the market to use it. this will create a situation where the market is no longer the best place to put your money for profit, and the big boys will get out too. i really think the vaccine approval will be the tipping point of where this all crashes down.

Highly doubt it's Subway, why would Bill acquire another fast food franchise when he already as 3? Pretty sure that goes against portfolio diversification lol. Also, would you consider Subway a "high growth" company? I sure wouldn't.

Realistically, I think we either get Stripe, Coinbase or Bloomberg. I am optimistic though, and I think anyone here would kill for SpaceX (very unlikely), Epic Games, Robinhood (would probably meme triple in 2 days), or ByteDance. Regardless what we get, I agree with you in that the reason I'm investing is because of Bill. He's been through this before with Burger King, so he knows what works and what doesn't.

Also, if breadfruit ends up being right about Stripe, I'm never questioning him again lol.

Maybe its different in the States, but if they dont get any new consoles by Spring 2021, than they wont have anything to show for on Q4 (atleast up here in 🍁). Or maybe the staff were just retarded and talking out of their asses

What if we never hear from this again
How owning puts works:

Day 1: even +/- 15%

Day 2: open at -37% and spend three hours waiting for downside while it bleeds to -48% until EOD selloff leaves you at -14% so you hold overnight expecting to break even the next morning

Day 3: open -80% before swinging up to -34% (this is it, you think) but then a pump comes through and you’re back at -74% 

Day 4: open at -88% and sell for a loss 

Day 5: your puts are now up +800% so you buy them back with what little you have left 

Day 6: go back to day 2
Could be worse. You could have -$30

College won't do shit for your income. Every guy I know with some Masters stem degree is working blue collar shit, including myself.

Literally everything has been outsourced at this point. Find some boomer holdover job thats still unionized if you want any chance of an income.

Whatever, still buying PLTR tomorrow morning and retiring this time next year.
Are you taking about capital gains tax? This is something I’ve never understood: how is selling and paying tax on each trade any different than paying a fat capital gains tax after 30 yrs? If it’s a percent of gains then it should be equal either way. Because tax grows just as exponentially as gains. Like if you sell and buy at the same price every day sure you have to pay tax on the gains from the day before and it shrinks portfolio but you pay less tax down the road right? Because gains start at zero again at each buy. Do you know what I mean? I’m obv missing something bc common knowledge says otherwise.
Is this week more green or elevator door in The Shining red?

Me too.  Never seen that before.  I think it's because such a high percentage of the investors now, are young enough to not remember the dot-com bubble or even really much of the 2008 crash.  I think that's also why we keep hitting the roof and falling back.  In the past, investors would have been thinking it was time to sell off for a while, but Zoomers are still going in hard.

* [This is considered the most viable plan for stopping solar winds from depleting the atmosphere.](https://phys.org/news/2017-03-nasa-magnetic-shield-mars-atmosphere.html)

* The timescale for that depletion is very very long. So even without such protection , it will take thousands and thousands of years to make a dent on the new atmosphere.

RKT has been a great CSP play for the past couple of months. I'm using proceeds on weeklies to buy shares. There is no stress from watching it trade in its channel. When it finally breaks out, I'll essentially have only free shares. 

Up, down, sideways? Who cares? Always have a plan and remove emotion from your trading.

Thanks for the input. Would you happen to know any resources where I can look up historical volatility levels by date for a ticker symbol?  I'd like to look at IV pre and post earnings. It seems to me that vega trades can be highly profitable strategy since volatility tends to increase around earnings time.

The market has just been plummeting every time it gets close to the all-time-high for the past few months.  It finally made a new high recently, but if there was new money still flooding in, like it was before, then why the pullback and constant failure to go higher?  And now that we have, how long will it last?  Obviously no one knows(it's impossible to predict) but if I had stocks, I'd be rolling out of the market already.

No, I haven’t. But there are enough reasons why this would go up again. Delisting was faaaaar overblown and IMO NIO is doing amazing with their technology and their targets. I really do believe that they provide a solution for the biggest downside of an EV, being charging your car.

Great post - many thanks. Quick Q on timing speculation though. Why would Bill announce before Hanukkah and not after? I thought I read he said that an announcement would likely come Q1.

For the calls, yes - I should have been most specific. 

If it behaves anything like the EU/UK announcement the share price will spike a little but still floor at like $40. Calls will only spike in worthwhile value momentarily.

I see what you’re saying but unless you think the price will move steeply very fast there’s no reason to buy calls that you expect to expire OTM.

What are you even doing here then
Time to find out if holding tsla calls through the weekend was the move or complete failure
Three months for almost all the shares
Your risk proposition hasn't changed, it actually is technically higher given you assume liquidity risk by holding the asset overnight. There just existed a small arbitrage opportunity that could be capitalized on for a period of time. 

You need scale to make this both worth your time and your dime. Assuming the net change between close and open (doesn't include down days or other freak swings) is 0.001% (a tenth of 1%) per day. After a year or about 250 (simple math) trading days, equates to a 25% return on the market from JUST that trade. Awesome, winner winner chicken dinner. But you CANNOT miss a single day, cannot "instinct" extra gains, just simple, open-close every day. 

But say you have trading fees, let's assume $3.00 per full circle trade. You need to make above $750 per year to cover just the fees. To get to $751 to even show a $1 profit. That is currently ~9 shares of the SPY at its last close ($369.85) or $3329 invested to net $1 above fees to your pocket. Congratulations, you made $1 on $3329 not to mention the time value of your time to open and close the trades (WHICH IS VALUABLE). Plus, gotta pay uncle sam, so there's that headache. 

Now, at scale, when you're talking $1BN moving around, that's when this trade makes sense. The fund nets $1M per day on it. At that level, go for it, get those free micropennies, but for us down here scouring WSB, our time and money is better used yeeting 0DTE PLTR calls and pumping fuel into the GME moon machine.

Technical analysis suggests it will breakout 

Similarities have beendrawn to a pattern with Tesla a few months ago
The vaccine contains aspike protein called syncytin-1, vital for the formation of human placenta in women. If the vaccine works so that we form an immune response AGAINST the spike protein, we are alsotraining the female body to attack syncytin-1,which could lead to infertility in women of an unspecified duration.
Vix will be back in the low teens in a couple weeks and then we will just slowly melt up throughout 2021. Not too late to jump in. If you a boomer just long infrastructure stocks.
I dunno futures for election week pretty much gave everyone the sign to go. And futures for the crash told you the floor was falling out.

yeah it's just funny that this visionary CEO would take a picture with one of the biggest celebrities and the quality of the pic is the same as a college freshman whose smartphone is from like 2016

I closed out my NIO calls Friday and loaded up on TQQQ. Also have a call on Carnival that's killing it rn. Waiting for Roblox IPO and I'm going balls in on that lol.

Why u mad bro? We have the toughest drinking water standards in the nation. Flint got a pretty generous settlement and they have clean water already now. Except for houses which themselves contain lead pipes which is what you still see on social media. Lead water is an issue throughout the country, most people just don’t monitor for it and don’t get rashes from other contaminants in the water which causes it to be tested, like in flint.

I know he said they don’t want to IPO but he was talking about being a public company in general when he said 

“It’s not the case that we're in a slow-growth phase where the business still acts in this very predictable manner. We're more in the helter skelter expansion phase and will be, I think, continuing to operate in that mode for a few years.”

He doesn’t want to be public until they are a “steady business” and the fact they are raising another round means that they will have no problem securing the private funding to do so. 

All of the evidence you have points to Ackman wanting Stripe not Stripe wanting to go public. The only evidence I’ve seen is the job openings but some of those job openings would be required for a finance company of Stripes size even if they stay private. 

You can’t ignore the fund raising, the trolling, Ackmans statement that they aren’t ready, and Collisions statement that they aren’t ready. 

That’s why I sold
You miss the last couple weeks?
Don't know too much about AI but ABNB was looking to IPO back in March for 18b and now they are valuing themselves at 36b - in line with the overall travel market. If they ipo at 44, I expect a pop up to atleast 75
ASL? Jk, get well soon breh
69? Nice. 

I am a bot lol.
Abnb has a date for the ipo?
Good point

I do think she’s going to be POTUS sometime in the next 8years. Biden and trump both will die or be way to old for re-election and incumbent always have the upper hand. MM has had to have taken this into consideration. CH is still apart of the establishment, I think an AOC/Bernie (New Deal Camp) would be way more influential to the market. CH has deep ties to tech and Biden is strengthening her ties with WS. I agree it would be an impact but I think it would be short lived

The number of people messaging me begging me for money over the weekend has been appalling. Everyone has some sob story.

One retard told me he "agrees with my post" and then said he doesn't know what SPY is. Like bitch you can't agree if you are that fucking retarded.

Anyway futures aren't green yet so I guess not a terrible start...

You’re missing the point that the vw short squeeze occurred because two of the major share holders owned 90% of the shares and refused to sell. GME ownership is more spread out everyone would have to refuse to sell to it squeeze in the same way.
PFE prices should also spike around the 10th w/ FDA approval but if it's anything like what happened w/ EU approval, it's a narrow window.
They have an implied move of +/-8 I think tomorrow

If you're looking to go long, ABNB is probably going to spike like a mother fucker week 1. You might want to wait until it calms down, although the whole market is overbought right now. If you're looking to make some quick tendies you can ride the wave up
I love how quick people are to decide how Monday open looks based on futures being open for less than an hour and only +1 or -1.

Personally if it is -0.01 or better

So -0.00965 is ok to me whereas -0.0345 that would be too much theta

The bigger the negative theta the more decay as time passes.

I dont want my contract withering away, I want it to be worth significantly more even 6 months from now because it could spike up between now and then

That's why I like OTM long calls on options with far dates til expiry

Get a prescription for finasteride, around 1mg dose daily, thatll slow down your hair from actually falling out. Go buy some rogaine, foam or liquid 5%. That will promote growth. You could also use ketoconazole shampoo and a dermaroller as well, those have been shown to help. Finasteride and Rogaine are your best bets. Results wont happen over night but in 6-12 months I promise youll have a better head of hair then today

If I don't know what I'm doing or the winners seem random but I want exposure to a sector, I'll pick an ETF like ARKG.  I can't tell who is going to have the big breakthrough, but I know several of these companies will have big enough wins where it will more than make up for the losers.  There is no amount of DD that I can do that will tell me which one of these is going to have the big breakthroughs.

However with tech I feel more sure footed.  I can generally tell who will win and who will lose.  An ETF for this makes no sense and will just water down my gains.  Figure out your strengths and play to them.

Then you sit tight for March's earnings.  Or reinvest in something else for the time being.   Between now and March, it's realistic to believe this will move 2-3% up each week.  For some, that's good enough to park their money for 3 months, for others, might be too slow.

I'm gunna say it one last time so all you autists can't say "why didn't anyone tell me about this company?" when the price goes up 300% in a year.

LGVW, received funding from Fidelity, Bill Gates and ARK invest bought in bigly on the 2nd of December at around $14... Not even the $10 nav price. 

So ask yourself, if $14 a share is good enough for one of the smartest investors out there, is $15.50 a share good enough for a scrub such as yourself?

PLTR calls were really good to me. I got in at $22 and rode it all the way to last week with calls and shares. Felt like saying goodbye to an old friend selling off the last of my calls last week lol

Buy the stock itself instead of options or warrants.
Every IPO has dipped in the first hour. Wait for the dip and load up.  Check Snowflake and Lazer for reference

my problem with modern monster movies is exactly what you said, i want to see giant monsters beating the shit out of eachother but the movies keeping cutting back to the humans for 30 minutes to explain whatever bullshit reason they have for the monsters to fight. like i with Skull island i want to see Kong wrecking shit like with the helicopters, its the other 90% of the movie i have problems with, same with both Godzillas. they are all still better than what critics said tho solid popcorn movies.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
Last Monday was red.
How long have you been in the market to not see a red Monday? Lol
Good point.
What’s the saying again? Red night bulls delight or something like that
The fact that Silverfox or Ginger brothers havn't denied it is sus. You would deny it as soon as possible so that you can reduce stock holder volatility while they jump on another company to speculate. This is why 25% of my portfolio is in the SPAC.

I’m not a bear, at least not a pure one. Got 500 pltr and 250 psth, but being buying vxx calls since last week. If next week there aren’t a national response to covid and stimulus, I’m gonna sell all my 12/31 calls and move those back to Jan-Feb, i hope I don’t have to that cuz I don’t want to see this country going down to the road I think it is going.
Unless we go to war with Iran. I’m in SF. All CA is in lockdown, covid surging, RG has covid. Market doesn’t care anymore. The light at the end of the tunnel is here. Q2 2021 we’ll be back to “normalish”

GA runoff has the ability to give Dems the upper hand (Which all big money is worried about). 

What else could we have at this point (Outside of civil/Global wars)
All right brother, well I get it, you were just living on a prayer, we’ve all been there.  But I got to be honest: it’s not looking good at all.  It wasn’t looking good on Friday, but you were throwing out a Hail Mary, I get it... what’s your expiry?

Bears know how to wait
This is leaving out that they said they don’t want to go public because they want to focus on long term expansion. They can easily raise money without going public.

This is the struggle I’ve been having for the last 2 years.

I make about $250k and still feel like I’ll never have the things I want for me and my family.

So I trade actively and usually do okay, but this year has been a shitshow.

Up $300k, then down $50k, then up $100k, then down $30k. Currently up, but not by nearly that much, considering the effort and stress.
Don’t try to explain to them growth rate vs trailing P/E. They think GM is a great investment now.

Non meme answer, Japan's populations millenials are reaching prime spending age, and will prosper for 3-4 more years on generational spending. Same will happen to the US in 2024 a new bull saga.
When you sell a call, you’re selling the right to buy stock at a price.

So, If you own 100 shares of a stock you can sell a call that is “covered” by your own stocks. If they exercise the call, they’ll be buying your 100 shares at 100*the options strike price.

It’s covered as opposed to selling a naked call. If a naked call is exercised you need to buy the 100 shares to sell to the exerciser - meaning infinite potential loss hence “naked”
Been eyeing them too. Chart looks prime for a break above 500 by EOY/mid-Jan
Agree. Maybe that’s what we should ask of the government? Instead all we hear is write us another check. $3T here and there. We’re becoming a country full of poor people and the government comes in at the tail end to help this and that. No one’s looking at the source of the problem.

It's an old technique that's been used for years. Big money still does it. The opportunity is most profitable at scale, without commission. The spread on the trade is so small now it almost doesn't make sense for retail traders. Could you do it and net a return? Sure. But you're hunting for pennies and nickels in a couch with this trade. 

1. Never could reliably profit off options #vega
2. SPY shares only and hopefully the MM don't front run you too hard and scalp your pennies before you can bank them

Only if you timed it perfectly. And unless you were in DGAZ instead of UGAZ. We're talking 20% moves overnight to scare you, then you sell and the next day you'd be in the green if you held. It's insane for anyone but a professional trader or a producer that needs to hedge to get involved in natural gas.

Do you like 8% returns and having to micromanage a business? 

If so . . . 

Be my guest. 

You can squeeze more out of 8% probably 15-20% if you’re working in it like owning Subway or whatever. But it’s basically buying a job. 


McDonald’s and Timmy’s are expensive up here like 950k-1.5mm for one.

Regulations are the biggest reason companies can't innovate. Especially in the medical sector.  Especially big companies.  

If a company like Medtronics wanted to create a new, cheaper,  easy to use,  portable ventilator.  They would spend millions on market research,  design,  optimisation,  regulation compliance,  customer feedback,  brand recognition, profitability,  manufacturing,  resource supplying ect ect ect.  

Meanwhile a small engineering firm in Guildford, UK attached a pump bag to a children's snorkel, ran some tests on dummies,  got some doctors to assess it, then sold thousands of units to charities working in Asia and Africa without expensive equipment or access to reliable electricity and literally saved thousands of lives,  making hundreds of thousands of pounds in the process.  

Big things move slowly.  Innovation comes from small companies,  startups and the like.  Optimisation comes in later when the big companies get involved.

One of Mar’s biggest problems is that it’s core has cooled and as such has a weak magnetic sphere protecting it unlike Earth. Any terraforming we do might not work because of it.

Any terraforming would require nukes more powerful than we have or more simply: slamming shitloads of Asteroids into the planet to transfer heat/energy to its core to get it jumpstarted again. 

If we than artificially cooled the surface fast enough, these astroids would provide huge metal deposits (this is how Earth got its metal deposits) and water since astroids also carry ice and the poles would have melted into vapor, which would than form oceans as it recondensed during an artificial cooling phase (again much like Earth own history except just over billions of years).

Though weather we actually do this or not is questionable. While it would give us another habitable planet if done right, by time we reach this point in technology (probably in the 2100’s or 2200’s since science goes at an increasing exponential rate) humanity will probably be relatively comfortable on Earth (birth rates get extremely low as countries develop and we will probably settle at around 12 billion humans and have low or negative growth) as our tech will have comfortably increased the planet’s carrying capacity as it always does.

Honestly terraforming planets will probably only need to be done as a showoff kind of thing as power blocs race in a kind of cold war.

Or will all be living in some kind of Hellish dystopia with Elon’s chips streaming us constant Tesla adds.

Beta is the benchmark. A beta coefficient is the volatility relative to the benchmark. There is "market beta" and "stock beta" if you will, the coefficient is the junior to the benchmark itself.

The easiest way to think of this is that your benchmark has a beta always equal to 1 but never more or less and anything you're comparing it to can have any value including 1.
Did you mean 14?
Yes 50 coming

Answering that question will take forever.

It is not an exact science ppl r wrong all the time but as time goes by experience does help in making better decisons.

Also, if my neighbor uses amazon, I don’t have to deal with the delivery guy coming to my door drunk at 4am speaking Italian.  There is far more reason to legislate against Airbnb and far more public support.
Say wrong person...

I’m not going to disagree you cited some prime examples of innovation and I happen to use a bunch of them. Just watched a concert on YouTube yesterday and it was wonderful. I can’t go to these things nowadays due to Covid. 

Now, speaking of Covid, remember when it first hit? The hospitals, doctors and citizens didn’t have and couldn’t buy protective gear. So much of what we use is all made overseas. 

We need “old school” innovation where we make things. We need to manufacture tangible products so people can have real jobs with benefits, etc. 

We lost our manufacturing base. When the next virus comes, and it will, we will be helpless because of our supply chain.

Not only would this be tiresome and repetitive (over the course of 25+ years, at that), you probably wouldn’t make much of a profit to justify it between tax and paying commissions on every trade until recently.

Those of us who time the market and make 100% a month with our surgical trading, require the herd to mindlessly throw money into indices (all the stocks we're trading) at the current market price to maintain liquidity and momentum.

Yeah, good thoughts - thanks brother. I’m tempted to buy March calls near the money to keep me a little more liquid and then plan to exercise most if we get an announcement and it spikes. But think I’m going to be buying shares here as well with a massive accumulation goal - hopefully before we get word on the target (crossing fingers Ackman waits until Q1 to give me more time...). Plan to dump whatever spike I get in GME into this one - seems like a once in a decade opportunity to get in on this while it’s still under the radar. Can’t tell you how much I appreciate your post - such an exciting opportunity. Can’t believe that GME and this are happening at the same time - threading this needle with all my available capital is going to keep things interesting for me in the next few weeks. Cheers and good luck to you friend.

Someone has probably brought this up to you I'm sure, but the only thing I think you'd want to pay attention to would be taxes.

Have fun this winter. I’m assuming you don’t get out much, which is why you are secretly not worried about it. But when you do get it, please just think of how much of a clown I think you are every time you struggle for a breath. Bye.
It doesnt really work that way. Look at the ytd chart of gold and sp500. They both went down in March. They're both up ytd.

My two cents on this one and a similar one. Why buy a used car in the next few years? When there is people trying to figure out how to mass produce cheap pieces of plastic and electricity with rubber traction and governments pushing for them (Albeit, we in the US are behind in that)

I think you will lose vs just holding due to the tax man.  This might work for a retirement account though.
Try “shake that bear”
Seems to have been a consistent winner. 
Question is:
Would you not have been better off just staying long especially considering the impact of all the commision youd have paid?
Only thing can think of is that you are theoretically taking less risk and could therefore add more leverage to this trade?
facts
I'm still holding SPY and TSLA puts (leaps) from March. Imagine if I just got calls instead?
They've generally been banning big companies from operating 2+ units in the same city, but not banning individuals from renting a room/ single house. That's not a problem for the platform. There can be just as many rentals, just not owners involved

Where’s u read that
Sometimes I find that when a stock plummets more than 25% from its highs it usually takes about 8-12 weeks to build a base and continue up. At least they are shares. God speed retard.
Thanks for reminding me about that Xilinx deal. I was planning on buying puts. Also that September drop off was likely caused by broad market sell off that analysts blamed on a technical correction.

It could pullback a bit I think but probably not all the way to September levels.

That Lisa Su interview with Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer will probably the catalyst to push to 100 in a week or two if we keep up this bullish trend.

> Farmers, hedge funds and municipalities alike will be able to hedge against -- or bet on -- potential water scarcity starting this week, when CME Group Inc. launches contracts linked to the $1.1 billion California spot water market. According to Chicago-based CME, the futures will help water users manage risk and better align supply and demand.
> 
> The contracts, a first of their kind in the U.S., were announced in September as heat and wildfires ravaged the U.S. West Coast. They are meant to serve both as a hedge for California’s biggest water consumers against skyrocketing prices and a scarcity gauge for investors worldwide.
> 
> “Climate change, droughts, population growth, and pollution are likely to make water scarcity issues and pricing a hot topic for years to come,” said RBC Capital Markets managing director and analyst Deane Dray. “We are definitely going to watch how this new water futures contract develops.”

AMC is great for them, keeps dropping to 3ish then bouncing to just under 5.  Also if you want dollar menu that isn't a weekly, look at stuff like RCL or AAL way out of the money stuff for popular dates (ie 1-15-21) All it takes is a good pop and travel stocks do that on a whim.

I'll be honest, after the SLV gang massacre in August I stopped touching meme stocks and started playing bounces and futures trends. (Check futures and play ETF/index based on what they show that day.)  I'm back up from being down to almost nothing, and now I'm militant about what I buy.  If the bid on the next lowest option is at least 1, you're in good shape.  The most common problem I have is not being able to get enough quantity of one I feel good about.  Some might say not be "the way" for wsb, but it's literally buying $1 scratch off tickets and I say that's pure autist behavior.

Yes it’s completely variable on what your benefits are for the equation. You could have a pension, or bonuses, etc. I just listed what the common one is. 

But the whole point is that you don’t need better than 10% if you manage expenses and continue to seek higher wage opportunities.

You gotta be able to spend money on yourself and what you want to do before retirement hits. Retirement is when you should be watching Netflix and youtube, now is when you should be taking vacations and working on your hobbies. If you wait until retirement you won't be able to do what you want to do. And what's the point of earning money if you aren't gonna use it? What'll make you happier, 7 digits in your account or actually realizing your dreams when you can still enjoy them?

Yup of course. If you are just going long on stuff long term you don't really need it. Its only if you want to swing trade or day trade. I've only done both this year and I'm up more than the cost of the market data but we are in a particularly lucrative bull market. I'm still trying to decide whether or not to keep it.

Over the next two years when the marker settles after covid and we can see the trajectory of the market more clearly I'll be doing long on ETFs with 50% leverage. 1.59% is worth it and it would take a 50% percent black swan event to get margin called. It's not impossible but it is unlikely.

It's very hard to predict how it will go. All we know is that the short interest provides ~65M shares of potential buyers. Look at TSLA and OSTK for a general comparison, although I believe GME will be much more explosive since TSLA and OSTK never hit >100% SI.

Umm did you miss CRM’s acquisition of WORK? I’m to dumb for maths but it’s about $45/share.
The GME play seems like one of the best plays this sub has ever sold. It’s predicated on buying shares which is inherently less risky and is predicated on a mass short squeeze triggered by a sudden price jump (company takeover or huge earnings). The speculative part of needing a great earnings seems par for the course for this sub while the downside is mitigated compared to the usual brain dead 5DTE .1 delta plays

Oh, if you want something bad enough there's *always* someone who will sell it to you. Their price might not be what you want, though. Remember in the example above where $WSB went up but the contracts were still worthless in the end? In that example you lose 100% of what you paid for the options. 

Options *can* be absurdly profitable, but they are also very dangerous. It's easy to lose everything, and that's hard to do with more traditional methods. If you're going to do this, do it with eyes wide open (it's very likely that you *will* lose money). My suggestion would be to get approved for spreads as quickly as possible and go with them until you start to get the hang of things.

Don't worry. 90% of this sub will never sell their shares/contracts even as the share price eclipses $100. They will spam "DIAMOND HANDS!!!!!! DON'T BE A PAPER HANDED PUSSY!!!!! GME $500 EOW" into the daily thread and on discord as the price peaks and falls back down from $100 to $12 in the span of a couple days. 

Most retards on here are completely incapable of doing anything but holding contracts until they expire worthless, no matter how much they are up at one point.

I'm in the same position as him.

It'd be better to sell deep ITM calls to ensure his current stash is taken off his hands then sell the deep ITM put at the $31 strike.

The volatility/time premium on that put nets .90¢ whereas the premium on the $31 strike call are only .30¢.

You will typically get more money for put premiums than call premiums.

Great writeup and I agree with everything you wrote. I know Bills expertise is not in Fintech but if the deal is with Stripe that would be legendary. 

People all you have to do to be a winner is buy commons in a ratio such a manner to maximize the warrants you get and hold through merger!
Is Dec 10th the last day congress can pass stimmy?

https://www.nab.org/documents/advocacy/2020CongressionalCalendar.pdf

The House takes off the 10th and the senate on the 18th?

And January there is no chance since the Senate is MIA.

So if no stimmy by Thursday... is stimmy next discussed in Feb when both are back?

And they also have to pass a spending bill this week to avoid a gov't shutdown?

Or... am I just completely retarded? I didn't study enough in 5th grade about how this bullshit works.
Lol at the retards who think inflation is “economic growth” muhhh stimulus... fuck off

Even if Covid had not happened, there was already a problem with over leveraged corporate debt. If anything, Covid has provided an excuse for a bunch of these companies to renegotiate their loan terms/extend maturities without getting penalized for their recklessness. However, the rot remains there and the question is how far in time can this be ignored

They want to IPO as soon as they are profitable, which they say should be by end of 2021.

Dude, you're so moronic it's not even funny. You do you. Don't pay attention to futures. Hell, don't pay attention to premarket or afterhours either since options open from 930 to 4.
Which broker did you use to sign up for the IPO? How much did you invest?
I don't know but I'm mad I got in at $249 before it yeeted itself off a cliff
Same. As soon as I saw $19.xx, I bought a few hundred shares.

If it continues to dip on Monday, I'll likely be going in more.
You’re expecting less than 100% upside, it might take over a year to happen, and it might not happen at all. 

Seems like there are more exciting opportunities out there. Gamestop short squeeze. Airbnb IPO. Recovery plays. Green energy, EVs, biotech, cannabis... in a less vibrant environment, PSTH would be attractive.

When you're down this big, sell your stock then sell weekly ITM puts at your original stock cost basis.

Most times you'll collect more premiums selling deep ITM puts than far OTM calls.
Give me an example of your style of post. There are three types of posts, posts for a stock, posts against a stock and posts the contribute nothing. Yours is the third.
It looks horrifying.

That's a man!
Exactly - so if they merge at a discount to the valuation the public market would set then the share price will go up. It all depends on what % of the company they’re able to secure. I can’t find where I seen the rumour they might be getting 20%, but even say they pay $4bn for 8% and it’s worth $100bn, then our expected share price should be $40
dunno im liking these red dildos
This is why i hate wsb sometimes. You ve done nothing more than a pump post, yet i m already 2k into psth
If you include market AH from Friday, this is actually the flatest shit ever right now.
I keep telling you guys, GME is the play.

\*Disclaimer- I will probably exit before earning because damn near every single stock has sold off after reporting this earnings season... but the risk is to the upside for GME so it will recover within 1 or 2 days IF it dips after earnings. Also, I will get back in regardless after earnings. I will only exit before earnings because my risk tolerance is very low... which says something if I am going long GME.
Let’s see some red baby🩸🐻

Lol no one was expecting an increase for the earnings, anyone dumping is missing the point.

If anything please do so i can buy more if it dips. I would also expect a bad quarter to be priced in currently.
I’m aware how math works.  I said 100+% annual because 800, 700, and 600% are equally retarded annual returns
As a guy who lost...a lot-ish on WGO...temper your expectations. WGO destroyed last earnings. They beat everywhere, raised guidance, upped the divvy, you name it. Lost 17%.   Just saying.

I’m honestly all ears for a bear thesis. Major correction already happened this year, corona fully priced in, vaccine on the way, why would we be anything but green as fuck right now.

Drop will happen but I think that will come post covid (summer) once vaccine and stimulus euphoria dies down. And inflation cause rates to go up.
From my view as a crm developer it was an excellent move to buy slack. That was the missing part of Salesforce to add a communication layer which can be used internal and external. In the long future Salesforce could also add a support system like zend desk.

You had me at the TSLA hype vs. valuation part. I’m sold.
I encourage all readers to go look at the post history. I have had 3 main targets, all of which I still own and provide analysis on 1) MAC 2) FNMA and 3) PSTH

Please go ahead and sift through the commentary. On PSTH, I am long. I trust Ackman and the investor list he's accumulated. I also subscribe to a lot of the arguments made by YOLO. I am leaning towards this being Stripe but like many of you, I am ready for any outcome and again a long term tontine hold.

I do believe the other commenter is correct in saying that there is a great short play opportunity here whether it be commons or options. Its ultimately up to the individual investor to review the info and make best decisions based on that and the premium to NAV they are paying for. Much more successful investors than us have paid a premium. That's one of my contentions here.

Anyways, focus again on the signal and not the noise. Character assassination based on incorrect reporting of my public posts is most certainly noise. Shame on you for that and for insinuating I am part of a scheme.
Will be a good long term play

Haha, I'm in at the same price point.

Here's what I did.

Sold my shares at a loss (should've just sold a deep ITM call) and then sold weekly $31p to collect $90 profit.

I will continue to do this for the next 6-8 weeks and will have made back my losses with premiums and if PLTR recovers, I'll make around $900 per put I've sold on top of the premiums.

I don't know why I hadn't considered this before, but I'm going to start doing this to ALL my long stocks that have weeklies. 

Just going to sell on Friday and sell puts with strikes 3-5% above actual stock price.

If you were wanted to sell the stocks, you'd have used a stop loss so if you're going to diamond hand it, at least use the capital you devote to it to earn income on your wagers.

Easy way to learn is deposit your savings into RH, enable trading options, then since you don't know what you're doing, start tapping things under sell put.

That strategy is akin to what most people already do here now.

really?  over 3000 new dead people the other day.  and deaths lag case surges.  so case surges today WILL give you death surges 2 weeks or so down the road.  And increased hospitilizations aren't a big deal when you go from 90% capacity to 98% capacity.  But when you go from 98% capacity to 105% capacity the system starts breaking down.  patient care delays and neglect turn into real bad outcomes.  patients OTHER than covid patients.  you know all the other sick ass people that hospitals take care of but can't get a bed despite having just had a massive heart attack or stroke or their bloodstream is full of bacteria and they're in septic shock... they get to wait in the waiting rooms or in hallway beds.

I actually think I’m going to roll my covered PLTR 30c 1/20/23 down to like a 22 or 25 just so I can hopefully get rid of it sooner. As much as I want to own the stock, I absolutely made a mistake by selling it so far out and I’m just kind of tired of waiting for it to be assigned. My cost basis is 27.5, so any strike above 12.5 will still net a profit.

how can we avoid this upcoming wave of evictions and foreclosures? the government delayed it from dec 31 to Jan 31 i assume to see where the vaccine will be by then, they might do that again a couple of times, the one month delay move, but that’s just delaying the pain not avoiding it
yeah, it doesn't get stressed enough that the system is actually brittle.  It has a little wiggle capacity for surges and then it gets overrun and all hell breaks loose.  There are patients OTHER than covid patients and then where do you put the heart attacks, strokes, septic patients etc.  Going from 150,000 new cases a day to 230,000 new cases a day doesn't necessarily mean as much as say going from 230,000 new cases to 240,000 new cases if 240,000 cases ends up breaking the fucking system.

A lot of strategies work better with less capital since you would affect the price too much when buying and selling otherwise. For example, small guy joe might buy 10% of his portfolio at a cost basis of 100, but a big fish might have to pay 110 for a 10% stake in their portfolio since they’ll bring the price up. This matters because if the stock is worth 112 then you’ll have a much bigger return for the smaller portfolio.

I think you have a solid thought process, but one issue for me is the time it takes for such a reversal to happen (I know people expecting that on GE for several years now). Even if they have good earnings and all that, sometimes the market doesn't respond to it. I think that's always a hidden difficulty in trading depressed stocks. Again, well done!

What you holding
Not really. It's like people have forgotten that the market doesn't just go up. 

This person bet on a stock tripling or quadrupling in 1.5 years. That's a crazy bet. Even if you had good reason to believe in the stock, you should never expect a stock to triple in 18 months. 

And if you did that with your whole life savings, well, you'd be an idiot, or be following advice of this sub.
He’s been short TSLA forever. He’s totally screwed and is doing all he can to exit the position including telling everyone tsla is going down.

Are those mm on the right describe how many millimeters gme mountains have?

CALLS on PFE & BNTX, also long reopening; airlines, cruises, hotels, restaurants etc.  Then PUTS on quarantine stocks; PTON, FVRR, CVNA shit like that.  However once the news is out pull the calls on PFE & BNTX from there hard to see they could go any higher for a while.   Next week do it all over again with MRNA. While you’re at it also buy Jan - March Calls on AZN and or JNJ they will announce their own vaccine info soon (and once they do short the fuck out of Inovio).
Dec 10 or 11.
Why does that say USO1 on there? I don’t think you actually have an option for the USO stock. If you bought an option for ticker USOI then your option is worthless because they’re trading below $5
Happy Checo got it. At least now no matter what he’s got a career win.
Because those companies can just pull an AMC and just dilute you into the dirt.

Im not looking to hit homeruns...just singles and an occasional double.  Ill take a walk or a hit by pitch.  I cant mess this up...I dont have enough time to make it back if I lose everything.  I understand both sides...and neither is 100% correct.

Ok looks like I'm buying BB at 8.55 and will put a sell limit at like 9.35 or something. Hopefully I can flip that stock and get in on ABNB at the release.

I have a pea size brain. This SPAC has a $4bn market cap, if stripe has $75-100bn market cap and they buy 20% (read this somewhere don’t recall exactly where) then this thing has to get a MV of $15-20bn? But you said it won’t quadruple?

>Yeah, they want to protect their well regulated hotels and people who work there. 

No,  they want to protect the well regulated hotels and the rich people who own them.  As opposed to the small time landlords hoping to make a quick buck by renting their parents apartment on ABNB. 

>The US excels at taking existing business models and modifying them a bit so the founders make it big and the risk is shifted to the others. 

The US excels at finding an industry,  and making it easier for the average citizen to enter it.  Twitter and journalism.  Snapchat and pornography. YouTube and entertainment.  UBER and taxis.  ABNB and hotels.  Robinhood and day trading.  The innovation is bringing it to the masses.  

UBER has famously never made a profit. The company is running at a loss to try and make UBER synonymous with lift sharing.  In the meantime the shareholders are subsidising the cost of journeys for the end user.  UBER drivers are happy,  they can make a decent salary and drive and own a car tax free.  UBER passengers are happy,  they get highly trusted journeys below market rates.  

Everyone wins except the shareholders who are holding shares that aren't worth anything.  The winners are the ones who sold out at IPO.

Jersey Mike's and Jimmy John's I would assume have higher growth rate but Subway is everywhere, even in the smallest towns because the franchise fee is one of the lowest.

If it is Subway do you think it will dip since it's not sexy like Stripe? Where could the stock go on a Subway announcement? I'm in at 24 avg and  going to add more this week. Will be my biggest non-ETF holding ever.

Try opening a real account that you can use for opportunities like this on the side. Its a boomer vibe but it stops you from limiting your potential when something attractive comes along.
They don’t even need to ban them.  The vacation rentals in FL are desert towns expect the random holiday spikes.  Besides,  homeaway and vrbo are exact same thing.

That is some really good insight. I’ve bought UPWK a few months ago bc I heard they have a better betting system and I think the industry overall has room to grow.

Bro look at the chart... It has $30 swings and you're calling that a slow churner?
I agree, I just have personally used their service and communication is a huge problem with bidders and most bid on all projects even if they aren't qualified... I have since been using a private company that sifts through qualified people first and then they personally match you with a person. 

More expensive, but it actually works. FVRR seems like the wild wild west of freelancing. That was my personal experience. If they changed their vetting process, then I understand.

Otherwise, I feel like people will use the service, be disappointed, and then go somewhere else to outsource.
AMD is at the same price range before it dived to the mid-70's last September. I wonder if the same thing will happen as last September or if it will finally break resistance and get past 100.

He's talking about futures. How many chromosomes you got that you didn't get that?
When you preface your comment with I’m dumb and poor then follow it with a strategy you think could work, you answer your own question.
Yah, the commenter is full of shit.  Beta is a measure of correlation with the market.  Mathematically, it’s the covariance of return vs. market return, divided by the variance of the market return.  It’s a number that is generally between -1 and 1, but can exceed those limits.  If beta for a financial instrument is zero, its price moves completely randomly with respect to the market.  If it’s unity, then it’s perfectly correlated.  If beta > 1, it means that the price moves more than proportional to the market (e.g, leveraged ETFs).  If beta is negative, then the price moves inversely to the market.
Well, unless you’re AMZN

Meanwhile, I’m waiting for Fidelity to not allocate any of the shares I requested at the offering price.
yep
Why
As other people have said - they've made some incredibly stupid moves, the management style of The Brothers Wu stinks, and all it took was a Citron tweet in December 2017 to knock their dicks in the dirt for 3 years.  November 30, 2017 high of $13.95, then dropped down into the $3s, $2s, and briefly the $1s over the next three years.  


\[Shit, even the 11/30/2017 high was off the ATH of $16.15 on March 13, 2014.  They haven't been able to get it up since then - it's been all downhill from there.\]  


Their 10 year chart is all over the map - it's a fucking roller coaster.    


Still, I think Himax may actually be a decent automotive play via their partnership with Lumotive, as well as some of their other sensor tech they'll be rolling out.  


It really doesn't matter, because some people BELIEVE this.  True believers will make this one worth jumping in and out of.  

&#x200B;

Because of the violent swings it's about to start experiencing after a 3-year hiatus, it's again poised to become a trader's and adrenaline junkie's delight.  There's going to be money to be made off of it.  


\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

TL;DR - Follow the Wyckoff Method, you'll make out like a bandit.
I’ve had two different family friends who turned a room into an air bnb exclusive thing and then the city shut it down a few months later. Sucks and is happening all over the US.

Could see this being a 30 dollar stock for a long time, not enough clear value in the product yet other then word of mouth its used by airbus, defense, and vaccine coverage. Too much mystery for ppl to bubble this stock extremely high in the short-term imo... And I'm in heavily.

Oh I get it, I would much rather do these options betw versus the bland partial buying. For instance I can almost guarantee you nvidia, sony, amd etc stock will go up wouldnt that be easy money to put calls in for those companies? Unless nobody out there would like to sell them to you knowing that they'll go up since they're going to do well.

Not selling until after the March ER. This squeeze will take weeks/months to unwind since it is massive.
Did you get in at $45?  INTC was screaming buy me and hold me tight when it hit $45.  It sure as hell isn't rocketing anywhere.  Hard cap of $60 at most, but no way it was staying at $45 and not going right back to $50.  Will probably bounce $50-55 now for a while.

I biught puts when ccl went up 8$ in one week. I lost my money very auickly. Dont do it
Yeah, I fucked up saying BB. Didn't realize how big the run up was on Friday. Need to let that drop about 30% first down to around $6. Once it does I'm going for Jan 2023 $10c. Emergence of EVs I'm hoping will give them a little run up on profits, since about 20% of their revenue is from EV software currently. 2 years for them to sort out their shit and build a profit margin comparable to other software companies.


Now that you made me think about it I'm prob not going to do it. I was going full retard, I should have never went full retard . Some more long PSTH contracts I guess.

There are multiple ways to make money. Someone swing trading stocks could tell another person everything he does, but that person may never be able to turn a profit. Buffet makes money going uber long. Others make money going short. There's no wrong way to make money, you just have to try something until you understand how it works and become consistent.

Rotation out to TRNE calls
Green open
I’m retarded, but in a zero interest rate environment and stocks being basically the only way to outpace inflation, that ought to create tremendous upward pressure in the medium term even as the fundamentals of the economy remain weak. There’s simply nowhere for the money to go, and there’s more in circulation than ever. Perversely, the worse shit gets, the more stonks should go up because your money is slowly eroding in your checking acct.
Same reason
The price accounts for the news.  So how does keeping up on news gives anyone an advantage?  Only a crystal ball or a correctly timed guess will help you beat the market and how can one do that consistently over a long period of time?

Yeah, they want to protect their well regulated hotels and people who work there. 

The US excels at taking existing business models and modifying them a bit so the founders make it big and the risk is shifted to the others. 

No innovation.

why is it harder to get a bigger return with more money?
Absolutely agree, if I had to guess we get some type of predictably bad news about corona next week and this consolidates close to 38 on the volatility swing.  That should be when you start licking your chops to enter
what happened? any news?

Depends on the stocks volatility, up or down.  People make it sound like it’s free money - it kind of is, but it won’t feel like it if you get assigned.  Only do this strategy if you’re willing to sell short term for a smaller profit than what you might get holding for a year or two.

Will it have options immediately? Do we know
Lol it probably will go down
Thx that is a very useful outlook. I do want to suggest that a lot of good news has been priced in. Therefor we might see a bit more bearish sentiment if either 1. Stimmy gets delayed, 2. Government shutdown comes closer. 3. Vaccine approval is kept pending on dec. 10. Your thought?
No, after the new years they will start talking about a bigger more comprehensive stimulus. Biden and pelosi already said as much

Looking for more oil recovery plays. I have leaps and shares of Shell, what else are y’all doing?
Now that’s some good shit
I look at options all day long, I see $5 and think $500, I see a deep ITM call at $100 and think, nice 10k there.
Pre futures ... think about what that means lol
Maybe I read wrong. Eps of -0.56 will be the end of the fiscal year number I believe. But even -0.81 isn't deadly by any means. Especially considering new console sales won't be reported in this er. I still think it's gonna be a beat. I also think an earnings beat would be perceived well, but that's debatable I guess.
100%
Sorry I was reading it as Friday. 

I’m bullish on RKT and have been swing trading it for months as well as selling CCs. This drop was not the norm. Hopefully it pops  back into its normal range this week and you can sell CCs and make some coin.

Thank you! I actually forgot that I was reading r/wallstreetbets. Thought I was on r/investing until a degen here pointed out that this, in fact, is WSB.
You toss and turn as Elon gently rubs your shoulders. "You seem a little tense" says Elon, as you look at your bank account. Your phone shows $107 left to your name. You think to yourself while Elon rubs you down, you pull open Robin Hood, type in TSLA. Leaps $900 JAN 2023' are only $1 you can afford 1 leap. This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be. He says "U, for 'you'" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.
  
  
All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, "we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase  options with a $25,000 barrier to entry."
  
You start weeping aloud,  you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, "what's wrong my little X'√π3?"   
  
Suddenly you wake, you're in a pool of sweat, at first you panic about the new options policy, then you're filled with relief realizing that options aren't restricted it was all a dream.   
  
You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200,000% gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $900 and realize the options are actually $20 each. The best you can do is $900 TSLA weekly expiring around Christmas.
  
In a slight fit of despair you try to remember the feeling of Elon rubbing your cheek, and rub one out onto your stomach, then roll over back to sleep. A single tear rolls from your eye into your waifu pillow.

There is no extrinsic value if no one willing to buy it. Trust me, I'll sell them when I can, but because they are not as easy to dump as OTM monthlies or weeklies, sometimes it just makes sense to exercise them. Imagine if you bought a 7.5c BB 2023 and BB runs up to $30 and you really want to cash in - do you think you will find a buyer? Same scenario, different strike: lets say you buy a 2023 15c, and BB never makes it past 10, and you decide to sit on it, you loose more money to theta because there is no intrinsic value to the contract. If that was an ITM leap, there is less extrinsic value to loose over time so the penalty for holding is lowered.

You might not have issues with a company like AAPL because of haw active the options chains are, so that is an exception to consider as well. 

The nice thing about ITM options is the intrinsic value, and because the cost is always less than buying 100 shares, its an easy way to leverage your account over time.

It will definitely drop occasionally due to market volatility but the direction will be generally upward.   Best of luck!

I'm a little hesitant to sell covered calls in case that's the time it decides to squeeze. I'm thinking about selling weekly puts around 12-13, making the premium or getting exercised to buy more at that price.
That I agree with. What I disagree with is policy and government rule based on something like genetics. The ability to abuse, manipulate or misinterpret the data is far more dangerous than any benefit in it's use.

If you guys like listening to confirmation bias that stonks only go up check out the work of Mike Green. He has been arguing for a long time that stonks go up due to the prevalence of passive investing in the major indices and money given to portfolio managers with the only criteria of “buy”, price be damned. Fundamentals matter to a point but inflows are incredibly significant.

Of course he makes a more compelling argument then my dumb-dumb synopsis because he is a lot smarter and a shit load richer than me.

Vaccines are rolling out already. Ik for my state NY we are going to vaccinate first responders immediately then move on from there. Pharmacies like CVS are going to be the main hub for distribution most likely.  The stimulus deal although doesn’t affect airlines directly, its just a positive outlook for the future. And usually when the market is positive most sectors see an increase.

Buying shares for the short squeeze who's with me?
[removed]
Man there are so many banned keywords here
I mean you're paying $500 to control 100 shares but you could have 100 at 850. Obviously a little more flexible with shares but idk if the leverage on options is better. Usually when he low value stocks are popping shares are better imo.
That was a fake post
eh, it's going to start trading well over double it's IPO price... so what then smart guy?  SNOW opened over double it's IPO price and then went horizontal for 2 months.  I'm just supposed to sit on a shit ton of cash for 2 months before maybe getting movement at the next earnings report?  This stock is going to absolutely skyrocket on day 1.  It's a fucking siren song to Millenial investors who think they know what the fuck they're doing.

If the US dollar really is gonna tank, then we should all take out cash advances on our Credit Cards to trade with. Just pay back the debt when its only pennies on the dollar.

At a 60%+ savings rate and 10% compounding you can retire in like 9 years. At 40% savings it’s 20 years.  That would be only 42 years old for most of us. 

10% compounding growth rate is amazing and definitely makes WSB gambling if you earn a good wage.

Fed will only raise interest rates if economy is doing particularly  well or if inflation is insanely high (see the Volcker shock). Interest rates have been very low post 2008 and I can't see them being raised significantly for at least half a decade (although money printer goes brrrr is likely to ramp up inflation at least a bit)

Tldr: don't need to worry about rho for now
I only bet on green.  Either I hit double zeroes or my bank account does.

What's the play if it's Stripe? Are we all just selling when the price pops from merger announcement? Or is this like a long term play, maybe years and years if it's indeed Stripe?   


Side question: How do you know when to get out of a position? Because the longer you hold the more value it will get, but if you don't sell you'll never realize the value.
insane even for this timeline
The guy getting roasted was an equity research analyst at bloomberg dipshit so I'm pretty sure he's not retarded like us to lose it all in one go dumbass
Every comment you write sounds like you have autism. Typical retard that thinks they are smarter than everyone but is so autistic they can't grasp simple concepts. Look at your post history, you ask dumb questions. Go back to posting about how sex is over rated you dumb assburger.

A lot of funds, especially smaller ones, are not declared and are not available for the average person. It’s also harder to beat the market with more capital so some funds don’t accept more. That’s why Buffett says he could do much better if he was only managing 100k. I think there are plenty of individuals and smaller funds that have beat the market consistently, but we don’t have access to the data

Typed this up in reply to another comment that was deleted.. think it can stand on its own though:

Most important factor to remember is with investing you are either too early or too late.

There is really no theoretical "perfect time" - that would be insider trading unless just blind luck.

No short/put position is gonna start tanking right away unless you are chasing, and no momentum play is gonna break to the upside right away, again, unless you are chasing.
what if it opens at 2X or 3X over IPO price?
It’s a pump and dump for sure
Only a matter of time tbh
This time last year I was at a kickass Bulleit Bourbon [event. ](https://twitter.com/pepeforthewin/status/1335707618870964225?s=21)

Chick I was talking to dropped me off because she had a wedding to attend. So I was solo. 

When she came to pick me up she was drunk and pissed because I got invited to the “VIP” room. I showed her pictures and she was upset for no fucking reason. 

I can’t count the number of nights I’ve had that start out awesome, then end in tragedy because of basically nothing.

people rode these up successfully over the course of a year or less to make a million

how did they do it? with the **long** yolo

and I think it will work with PLTR as well, which is why I haven't sold any and bought more on every red day

don't listen to bears, you'll be wrong sometimes: if you listen to bears trying to "help" you or scare you out of your position, you won't just be wrong sometimes, you'll be wrong most of the time

for each goddamn opinion you listen to you're going to be more wrong:

\- your judgment is wrong sometimes

\- my judgment is wrong sometimes

so if I'm wrong 1/2 the time, and you're wrong 1/2 the time, and you take my advice into consideration, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 therefore you'll be wrong 100% of the time

don't listen to me

There's 2 sources that MAY bring the market down. How much i don't know. Government shut down AND no stimulus (has to be a direct payment). Shit could be catastrophic
Best advice I can give if you're starting out is to just focus on 1-2 tickers at first. Get to know them, how they move, what makes them pump and dump, average volume etc until you know them like the back of your hand. It'll help you know when to diamond hand your plays or sell, when to jump in, buy the dip and all that stuff you need to do to be a successful trader.

Real talk
AirBnB is not and will never be 50% the valuation of Tesla. I can rent out my house but I can’t build a Tesla. 

I am sure cavemen were renting out caves and holes in the ground. AirBnB is just another exchange site for renters and small-time landlords. There are already sites that do that all over the world. 

Who can disrupt them? Amazon possibly. Otherwise, Hotels. They can easily switch their offerings to do what AirBnB does. They already have the infrastructure. 

There is no IP. Oh, and residents will always fight these short term rentals located in non-commercial zones. People want to live in peace and quiet. What’s the upside for them when strangers start pulling at night? Robbers? Who knows?

I bought these on the last day of December futures contract trading on Comex on November 24th. From watching the past 4-5 months the shorts push gold down hard the last day the following month trades. Then it gradually rebounds. So I figured the same thing would happen this month and it did. GDXJ bottomed that day around $47.92, I rolled the entire position into this week because the premiums for ITM calls are very cheap and I think with stimulus rumours the GDXJ could rally another 4-8% before the congress vote on Thursday.

I could but it's got more upside in a good target IMO.

But also, I foresee a barrier being implemented to discourage retail options trading. Not to protect people losing their life savings, but to stop the regular guys from making modest gains. Jealous cucks
You could be making Bank weekly just buy selling covered calls on these
Down 2% on the week

Not going down for sure

Headed to the upside down

London,  New York,  Barcelona,  Merseille, Rome,  Florence,  Venice,  Madrid,  Monaco have all either passed legislation specifically against ABNB or have legislation on the table.  

Sure,  buy shares for short term gains.  But if this shit was long term profitable,  it wouldn't be going public.  Buy options for the initial growth.  But after 1 year of trading,  get out.  Its not going anywhere long term.
Interesting opinion on VIX that differs from what I've been seeing even on the smallest red dildos
It’s simple, I buy more puts in addition to the ones I got on Friday. This shit can tank just as quickly as it rises in a few days.
Nice DD. Good retail play that I never even considered. I'm considering the 1/15 $35/40 call spread for 3.20. If the market drops I can buy back the short call if desired — but if they just instituted a dividend and are in great financial shape heading into the upcoming vaccine rollout, I don't see how this can go down meaningfully.
I bought on Monday and held as it went down below 18, and then below 17. 

I didn't expect it to just melt like this the week before earnings.
my calls are gonna go to the fuking moon if this hits 30 EOY

Shares are cheap right now. Its a solid company and actually HAVE an approved treatment.  They're backed by bristol myer squibb if i remember right. 

Calls r cheap as well. My personal target is 60 buuuuuuut, market is quite weird right now and saturated with bubbles an noone can tell what is about to happen.

Almost everyone lost their focus and only gazes at pfizer or mrna... and shitty chinese fraud commie stonks, like there are no other. So its a cheap buy either way if you ask me. 🤷‍♂️ 

Tldr: BUY EVERYTHING
Thank you for this, this has just made my day so much better.
Agreed on the late part, was too busy bleeding PLTR to give a proper writeup hence my mentioning we are likely in for a market cool off week and to wait for a red day to get options.  KSS has been my recovery whale pick from Day 1 and I lost a good deal trying to play them too early.   Last quarters earnings convinced me KSS would stretch to 40 by end of year (they were $24 at the time).  It happened 4 weeks earlier than I expected and has continuing momentum and is generating the cash to keep it going.
money launders (e.g. the crinimals and the wealthy) were upset that all their secrets are being revealed and threatened netflix.
Lol u holding those NVDA bags?
What the hell are you talking about
It’s already meme status just need a match to light that rocket fuel
I sold cash covered 12/4 22P for almost fucking $2.0 a piece, that IV (150-180%) was fucking delicious
Might buy leaps on airlines while they’re still cheap, debit spreads on SPY and QQQ. Pretty bullish on 1Q 2021
buy the dip and buy the 🚀 before it moons
Don't sell covered calls if you're not comfortable selling your shares. I sold nio at 19. So it goes 

But premiums are what I mean. Iv makes juicy premium. I've returned 68%in 6 months on primarily gaining premium, couple delta plays, small smattering of fd's. I realize it's not always going to be so easy, guess I'll just be making less money on premium when such a day passes

Thoughts on EEM? I've made decent money with it in the past month and rolled some of it into 1/15/21 53 and 55 calls. I did it because of the sheer inflow into those strikes, but that index has never been at those levels before. Ride it or dump it after about 20% profit?

I think I might keep risking something like 25% on short term calls every week so when the rug pull does come I'm not terribly leveraged. 

Retail will get dumped on eventually. 

Biden could even get dumped on very soon. 

Supreme court, military action, could be a very crazy next six weeks. 

The actual smart play might be to wait until the post-vacvine inauguration and then go all in on the stability we will finally have.
Hey man, I’m so sorry for all your losses. I hope you and your family can truly hang in there during this incredibly hard time.

Positions?
Fair, doubling her money considering the market growth is nothing impressive, but everything she said in her post was accurate advice to give new traders.
Credit gives you the ability to be almost 100% in equities. 

When you need to deploy a lot of cash immediately, you can use credit and then pay it off by selling equities or wait until next paycheck. Someone on bogleheads did an analysis on this strategy and it turns out that 100% equities beats having an emergency fund. Even in a worst case scenario such as market crash + losing your job, the person who had their entire networth in VTI/VTSAX still outperformed the person who kept an emergency fund.

Green in 54 minutes. Everything is always bullish  now. And now it’s time to rise another week on stimulus hopes. Like it could easily be a -2% day, but they can taunt the gullible market with stimulus every damn time. It’s literally like “the boy who cried wolf” except everytime the fucker cries wolf, it works. 🤡🤡🤡
People are hyping 10x plus long term cause they have the largest market worldwide. I only have 50 shares though cause I’m a GME cultist
Right here
15% dip
I know but I think after this crazy rise and slow down of momentum into close could bring a dip Monday at open
I’m not sure seeing as they can’t even break $35
Yea theres 3 vaccines out right now and getting shipped to every hospital in the states. Futures are officially in bullgang mode
Depends on starting price. If it's low enough, people will buy and hold which effectively brings up the cost such that even if it does dip, there is minimal loss.
Lol.. no

Plus Airbnb is first

Prices for copper have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore, the main ingredient of steel, is one of the best-performing assets in 2020. Other raw materials, such as aluminum and zinc, have added roughly 15% since the end of September and 40% or more since mid-May. And shares of metals producers, including [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FCX) Inc. and [Century Aluminum](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CENX) Co. , are on a tear, climbing alongside other stocks closely tied to economic growth.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/soaring-metals-prices-signal-bets-on-global-economic-recovery-11607250600?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/soaring-metals-prices-signal-bets-on-global-economic-recovery-11607250600?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

Investors are piling into wagers on industrial metals like copper and nickel, betting that coronavirus vaccines and stimulus programs will drive a boom in manufacturing activity as part of a global economic resurgence.

Prices for copper have risen to their highest level in almost eight years. Iron ore, the main ingredient of steel, is one of the best-performing assets in 2020. Other raw materials, such as aluminum and zinc, have added roughly 15% since the end of September and 40% or more since mid-May. And shares of metals producers, including [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FCX) Inc. and [Century Aluminum](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CENX) Co. , are on a tear, climbing alongside other stocks closely tied to economic growth.

It wasn’t profit sharing that caused the drop. It was share dilution. I think they slowly climb back into the $10 range in the short term.
BlackRock is long GME tho
Totally fucked
ok so I'm tired of being on the sidelines watching everyone else make money in this insane market.   I'm up about 3% for the year, most of my money is cash or useless bond funds.    I've got 550k parked in that boring stuff, could have make about 60 grand since Nov 1 had I just been in an index.   Argh.
  
Please let this nutzo market have a big pullback so I can get back on the roller coaster.

Wrong. Pre-split strike would've been 680, so put this into ToS: .TSLA210115C680. Adjust your time frame and look at the screenshot he posted below showing some purchases on 7/26/19 for 1.09, and your ToS will match up perfectly.

Even though it cost more than what his average cost shows, keep in mind the split put him (her?) into a new strike, and average cost also would've been divided by 5. Math works out.

TLDR:  

Now I know why that blog is called seeking alpha.
I’m going to dump GME tomorrow and take a little profit because I’m not confident in it and I don’t care if I miss out. I’m going get to sell my ERIC leaps at breakeven because there will always be another dip to buy. I’m going sell my LLNW shares and leaps and just a hold a small position after my jan puts get assigned. I’m hoping for a major catalyst to pay big on this one but it’s not worth risking more than 2% of my portfolio on a small cap who’s going up against FSLY. I have a number of small lotto plays that I’ll be dumping as well because it just takes my attention away from core positions.

I’m going to focus on AMD, DKNG, FEAC and NIO because those have the best odds of actually coming in over the next 3 months.
We got BB now, let’s go autards

nice, where do I start?
I just feel they will get back to $9.50-10 soon. The profit taking should be over by now and has held up fairly well. But that’s about it. No real idea just a hunch. I have a 100 shares. It could take until spring for it 🚀. I don’t mind holding fcel for a few months.
I was in Himax before his article but yes it did triple but Google Glass didn't make it mainstream. It only fit in certain niches. Now I think Google Glass used Kopin if I'm not mistaken. Himax is in a better position now than when they were in Google Glass.

GME puts are sounding good. WSB is not smarter than BlackRock.
If you guys don't already own one you should really get a money tree. My portfolio is literally up 250% since I've brought it into my office a month ago.

I've had it through some rough times but looking back most of my success has been when it was in the room I spent the most time in. Attention is its key.
Negative 500% is easy.

Sell naked calls against TSLA.
I don’t see much risk if I’m being honest with you
I'm balls deep in GME and ETHE please tell me it will be ok
Its how I play ITM leaps. You can buy OTM leaps and hope to sell the contracts, but the volume for most of these is very low making them hard to sell once you own them. I assume I wont be able to, so I buy atm or slightly itm leaps with the intention of exercising them. Its an easy way to add leverage long term.

It is because I am an individual that I pursue my own values. And one of my value is that I want there to be more people like me with similar personality to continue to exist. _Passion is but a slave to reason._ Maybe you can see how much decisions are driven by evidence.

AND LOL, I know I have issues, but I believe there are also good parts of me that **I really want** to be passed on. See _mutational load_. That's the whole point of sexual reproduction, because it randomly selects 1 of the 2 copies of each genes in you to pass on. There's literally no loss, except my time in college from getting extra lottery tickets.

If you also don't know, literally everyone has issues because genetic replication are flaky. But some people clearly have less issues.

Yea no sweat, I'm no expert either fwiw.

On 3) Basically yes, another buyer can just slide right in. You've sold the contract to open, and there had to be a buyer on the other end for that to happen, but you and that buyer are not linked until expiry.

Correct on the last part. 

Depending on how far out your expiration is you could try and buy back your contract and sell another one for a favorable outcome.

Like, you sell a CC expiring in 1/15/20 for $5 per share. Stock takes a hit and that Call is now worth $2.5. Buy it back with half your collecting premium, lock in $250 in gains and sell one closer to ITM for more premium 🤷‍♂️ Not investment advice btw I'm a fuckin retard

**[Antiviral drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral drug)**

Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used for treating viral infections. Most antivirals target specific viruses, while a broad-spectrum antiviral is effective against a wide range of viruses. Unlike most antibiotics, antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen; instead they inhibit its development. Antiviral drugs are one class of antimicrobials, a larger group which also includes antibiotic (also termed antibacterial), antifungal and antiparasitic drugs, or antiviral drugs based on monoclonal antibodies.

**Molnupiravir** (development codes **MK-4482** and **EIDD-2801**) is an experimental [antiviral drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug) which is orally active (can be taken orally) and was developed for the treatment of [influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza). It is a [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) of the synthetic [nucleoside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside) derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, and exerts its antiviral action through introduction of copying errors during viral RNA replication.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molnupiravir#cite_note-pmid31645453-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molnupiravir#cite_note-pmid31945316-2) Activity has also been demonstrated against [coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) including [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS), [MERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERS) and [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molnupiravir#cite_note-pmid32253226-3)

The drug was developed at [Emory University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University) by the university's drug innovation company, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE). It was then acquired by Miami-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, who later partnered with [Merck & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co.) to develop the drug further.

GA senate runoff - if both are democrat wins, senate goes 50/50 and VP Kamala Harris is the tie breaker.

Correct me if I'm wrong.
First rule of options trading, never actually multiply anything by 100.  It just makes the numbers bigger and harder.    

If you are fairly certain it will drop to around 300, you can buy a 310p and sell a 300p.  that way if it ends at or below 300 you make 10 dollars.     
The difference between 310 and 300 p right now is about 5 bucks so you could double your money.

You can sell anytime you like before or on the expiration date.
As the stock price gets closer to $300, the call options become more valuable. On the other hand, if the price doesn't change, with each day passing the options lose a little bit of value.

Im not sure what that position entails, but if he/she has minimal knowledge of options, that means zero financial education. They teach that at bachelor level.
I’m hoping we get a little fake rally to test the highs then fall so I can short ES
Use optionsprofitcalculator.com the get an idea that will help you a lot in understanding. Watch some YouTube videos and learn what actually gives options their value.
Actually i forgot i just bought RKT shares on friday. They have a good support level at $20.

They need to announce some new partnerships and start doing that stock buyback!
I mean a dell xps and a macbook pro are basically the same price.

I would say, new m1 macbook pro, asus zephyrus g14, or lenovo x1 carbon

Yes it is free money if it's headed in your direction, just not as much gain to be had.
Same boat, same thoughts on Monday. I'm converting my expensive ITM calls to new, cheaper higher strike calls to preserve more gains.
It sounds like you don’t know fully how covered calls work...

When your selling a covered call and it gets close to expiration and I’m assuming it’s out of the money so you have gained value on the premium

You then buy back the call - buy to close - and get the difference from what you sold and what you had to pay to buy it back

If you let it expire you would collect the whole premium

The buyer doesn’t have to do anything because you’re not tied to some specific person there just needs to be someone willing to sell for you to buy it back

Selling GME on Thursday before earnings report. Why hold if they're not gonna beat?
The December 10th meeting has been set for a while now and it's going according to schedule.

Plenty of dry humor and optimistic humor towards his dire situation. In regards to convincing him to strap himself in essentially a chair on a rocket, there was this line:

" [After hearing he has to take the top off of the Mars Ascent Vehicle] I know what they're doing. I know exactly what they're doing. They just keep repeating "go faster than any man in the history of space travel", like that's a good thing. Like it'll distract me from how insane their plan is. Yeah, I get to go faster than any man in the history of space travel, because you're launching me in a convertible. Actually it's worse than that, because I won't even be able to control the thing. And by the way, physicists, when describing things like acceleration do not use the word "fast". So they're only doing that in the hopes that I won't raise any objections to this lunacy, because I like the way "fastest man in the history of space travel" sounds. I do like the way it sounds... I mean, I like it a lot. [pauses] I'm not gonna tell them that."

"Also... more than 3 times as many kids go missing every year than who have died in the US from Covid"

That depends on when you exit. Which having perfect time is impossible. Some of their plays are hedges or 2023 leaps so it’s hard to enter those plays if you don’t have the capital. It’s a great tool to have to see where whales put their money. First 2 days have been meh/bad plays, so hopefully this week brings back some form of gains

Yep... looks like it... checkout r/spacex
I'm copy pasting some who says it's Subway, which makes sense:

&#x200B;

 

Former CEO of Burger King that sold BK to Ackmans SPAC Justice Holdings in 2012 is now the CEO of SUBWAY.

In Nov, 2019 he became the CEO and brought in other executives from Burger King.

Subway suffered from decreased revenues from the pandemic and Ackman can get a good deal.

It looks like Ackman wants to do Burger King SPAC all over again. This time it is SUBWAY.

Look, Ackman said predictable cashflow model, and Subway's 8% royalty from the revenues is very predictable.

I doubt Ackman will be going after Tech unicorns which are trading at ATH multiples and cannot get a good deal. Why would he get Stripe at 100 billion market cap?

Everything is pointing to Subway.

Cidsey became CEO of Subway in 2019 and Bill IPO $psth in 2020.

Also the founder of Subway had passed away and his family do not want to run this business.

Edit: Yolo will never reply with counter argument because he thinks anything other than Stripe is impossible. Kid, please grow up and do a better DD.
Buy the dip, people. It will come.

In terms of steps to resolve:

1) Dust out vents, components interiors, if not

2) Malware possibly or hidden processes utilizing processing power when not aware. Recommend opening up HWMonitor and checking for temp + CPU usage for a while, if not

3) Re-apply thermal paste properly. You'll need to look up how to disassemble and apply it's quite easy to do.

BNTX is the better pure play on the Rona vaccine

PFE: 
-Market cap 224 billion
- 5.5 billion shares outstanding

BNTX:
- Market cap 29 billion
- 240 million shares outstanding

PFE is more conservative but you won't see major gains or losses. BNTX is higher risk and higher reward.
you're not gonna get theta fukt on a LEAP. SPY probably fine

I regularly meet people from both sides of the political spectrum who are skeptical of the vaccine (or vaccines in general) and claim they won’t take it once it’s available.

TL;DR Monday is gunna be fun, Tuesday if I see action moving toward $20 I’m anticipating a flash crash then back up during the earnings call. This ain’t worth $1B anymore

Ill use an analogy. 

Healthcare is a system. Much like the stockmarket. Sometimes systems get overwhelmed. When they do, things in society more broadly can immediately be impacted. Harken back to watching banks fall like dominoes in 2008. Remember how it took years to recover and how millions of families were financially ruined or harmed. and thats just *money* .. you're talking about a system that deals with *lives*.   Have you ever wondered, "I never get sick, why do I even have health insurance? Why do hospitals even exist?" 

The answer to these questions is because: There are other people besides you. And hospitals are operating normally at full capacity. And if 9 million people all had a heart attack tomorrow, you'd see them collapse, alongside the EMS system, due to overload, along with the police system, due to civil unrest bc grandmas dying in the parking lot while other people are inside getting treated, along with the judicial system because of the backlog, along with the fire dept because they manage EMS and the civil unrest leads to arson. Then the NG gets deployed but I'll be darned, their parents are dying too, and they dont give a fuck about doing their jobs when their parents are dying in the parking lots. 

Thats why its a big fucking deal. Because it risks the very premise of ongoing peace that your ass relies upon to trade.
They don't but they do give a fuck about they're money in the stock market
This guy doesn’t know about quantitative easing lmao
Very nice job

I’ve been on Investopedia for a few hours and felt like I had a grasp but got confused on the big words haha so thanks a lot for the plain English

#3 is interesting, for some reason I thought the contract sold stayed with the buyer either until they sell or expire. But if they sell another buyer can just slide right in? 

And the reason why I wouldn’t collect 2x premium on the same contract switching hands is because my collateral stays the same?
All over that juicy little money machine
Well options aren't available for 5 days anyways, if there's a dip I'll wait. But  are there other concerns? I for example I think that it will double in a year and the IPO price is 100. Is the bext way to capitalize on that to buy something like 250$ 1 year calls? Not sure what price I should target..
I like fishdicks

we had multi-day squeezes from 10 to 16 on microsoft profit sharing news and hedge fund investment in october and then 10 to 19 with console release in november. Sure it didn't do that in a day and it wasn't to infinity but those are substantial % moves and things are just starting to heat up. 

Looking forward catalysts such as positive ERs, potential investor activism or acquisition and other neutral to good news and announcements are expected to perpetuate and accelerate the upward trend. If the news is it will for sure get interesting. Patience pays.
Senate will likely not pass it because "muh devil's lettuce". Sundial and a few others that have been talked about here took a shit after the news.

I'm not 100% but my best guess is overheating. There are a lot of issues with thermal paste application by  OEM manufacturers both with their method of application and the quality of product. Don't forget to dust out your vents. When was the last time you dusted bro

I typically reformat my system to Win 10 LTSC enterprise version which is as barebones as it gets and re-apply my thermal paste if I notice odd temperature readings.

okay let me explain it, you sell CC for 100 dollar premium, and its quantity should be -1 ,now you are short one call option, before it expires if it lose value you can buy it back let’s say for 50 dollar. Now you realized 50 dollar profit and its quantity is 0. you dont wait anything else

Buy GME shares and get rich!!!
You should do some more reading on your own but

1) You'd be buying to close a covered call

2) When you buy to close, you pay the going rate for the option currently. What ypu collected in premium when you sold to open- the premium you pay to buy to close = your net profit.

3) It doesn't matter what the guy on the other side does, unless it goes ITM and you get excercised. The covered call you sold could change hands 10000x between the time you sold it and expiration.

I'm very bullish on JKS. If you look at their news for Q3, they supplied additional 126 MW of modules to Chile, 611 MW to Vietnam, signed contract for 1GW to Shanghai, revised forecast to supply from 22 to 25 GW by 2022, improved efficiency of modules. Q3 looks to be a sure winner, all solar companies beat earnings in Q3; JKS will definitely not be an outlier.

Hey Mods while you’re at it, could I be crowned JWN King?
No I don’t think so, I’m just trying to close the CC and profit the premium, but I’m not sure if I have to wait until the contract expires or if I collect all of the premium as soon as I sell. 

But If that’s the case what would be the point in holding till expire? So I’m guessing it’s wrong

I think the buyer has to agree to close the contract and give up the premium after I sell to close?
True, is using margin an option for you?

if not then I would go $AAPL

100k isn’t enough for 100 shares, so that’s not an option.
People have preferences but the data is pretty clear. Over time index investing, specially the S&P500 is better than any other strategies. Even timing strategies for the S&P are worse than just riding the market, and putting money every month.

if you pick the stocks yourself, you will pick the wrong stocks at the wrong time, and won't have a better annualised return than the market. There are very few people in history that beat the index for 10 years, and the number drops with every consecutive year.

If you invest in a fund, and "experts" pick the stocks, they will charge you 2 and 20, so they will have to get a 15% so you get 10%.

Most professional investors and institutions fail to beat the market every year.

Over 30 years, the average is much much higher for the index investor.

do you want to be a Nero or a John?
You need to let them expire to get full premiums.

With that said, you can often close covered calls a few minutes before the market closes on Friday for very low cost.

If you close your covered calls early (buy to close) you’re buying someone else’s contract, not the contract you sold to the initial buyer (theoretically, it can be but it’s a slim chance).

You’re just transferring the covered call liability from you to another seller.

Why note BABA? Its been beaten down much more and has a more recognizable name
U open a sell contract with premium at $10 and expires Friday. You get $10 at this moment 

If stock goes up your premium does too, it’s now worth $15, you can buy to close, but you would actually lose 5 bucks 

If stock goes down your premium does too. It’s now worth 5 dollars. U can buy to close and you made essentially 5 dollars, could have rode to exp and gained 10 total, but this was faster

In either scenario if the option expires worthless you receive whatever the initial premium was. You can expedite this if stock drops and your premium approaches zero faster. 

Once the contract is out of your hands your profit/loss ends on it. Whatever they do is only affecting them at this point.

Lol look at GoPro's stock
OK, so let's say I buy a share of $WSB at $10. If the value of the share goes from $10 to $11 then you make $1. If it shoots up to $100 then you make $90. What Stockpile is going to do is buy some shares of $WSB when people start wanting it. Then they make up this fake asset called, "fractional shares". These fractional shares represent partial ownership of $WSB, in that their value is relative whatever $WSB is doing. They're fake, though, because they only have value inside of Stockpile.

Basically, Stockpile is the same as owning shares with more serious. So let's talk about that guy with the TSLA. For simplicity sake, let's go back to $WSB. A call option (AKA Zoomie) is an agreement that you may buy 100 shares  between now and some point in the future for a given price. Let's say you buy an $11 call on $WSB expiring at the end of January. Let's say it costs $0.01 per share. That means you pay $1 per contract you're buying. For the same $10 you payed for one share, you can buy 10 contacts of 1/31 $WSB $11c.

Now, let's say $WSB goes up to $11 (or even goes down). Your call lets you buy for $11, but why would you do that? You can get it on the open market for $11 (or less), plus you spent all your money buying this call so you can't even if you wanted to. 

But... if $WSB goes to $100? Well your 10 contracts let you control 1,000 shares. And you have the right to purchase 1,000 shares for $10/each then immediately turn around and sell them on the open market for $100/each. That's a $90,000 profit on your $10 investment. 

That's what $TSLA boy did (TBH, I didn't get the reference, so this is just based on guessing). Interestingly, Buffet went the Stockpile route.

If any of you autists did the right thing and owns more than 100 shares you would’ve sold covered calls last week  (Monday to 12/4 expiry) and bought more shares with the proceeds. I went up 500 shares just on the stupid IV for a week.

If this fucker drops to $12 (like I’m anticipating on numbers) by the end of the earnings call it’s going to be above $16 again by the end of AH and probably above that

He's hoping for the best, but this just seems like a short as an insurance policy.
Yeah true. Lot of stocks seem to have those periods were they rise relentlessly for a short period and then go sideways. Berkshire has done this a few times now. From 2012 till 2015 - then sideways for 1,5 years then rising again till 2018. And then sideways from 2018 till last month The stock broke to a new ath recently. TSLA might be another example. Rose from 2013 till 2015 and then sideways for years basically till the summer of 2019

Big circuit breaker tomorrow
Quick question for anyone with a brain... what’s the difference between selling my covered call early vs letting it expire. 

When I sell to close the contract does the buyer also have to sell before I collect the premium? 

Also, does ALL of the premium still come my way if they sell before expiration at a loss? Or do I need to wait until it expires in order to collect the full premium?
Good luck
Bade minimum you'll get dizzy.
Guys to make myself feel better, most of the losses you see are the 10k gains from pltr and tsla split into some Ls so i wont really lose much of my initial investments if all options expire worthless i will be losing 2k at most.

CVS isn't going to hire a ton of pharmacists at 6-figures/yr to give shots for a couple of months. The volume of immunizations that are going to be given is staggering, and this is smart on their part. I'm a pharmacist and have no idea how I'm supposed to make this work in my daily workflow.

All about GME now
Within a browser, Firefox abs chrome for me, you can alter the markup and see it change in real-time. You could change the balance of your RH account. 

However if you have open plays, and it’s during market hours, any changes you made to the markup will revert back and change as the values are constantly being updated. 

You could bypass this with some simple photoshop but OP showing a video is much harder to fake.

Did this guy get really lucky? Probably. But that apple engineer is so condescending and negative for no fucking reason. Probably just salty because he learned that “the best way to invest is to dump all your money into an index fund!”. Typical pretentious big ego software engineer who thinks his job at apple means his iq must be above 140!
If mods find it’s not fake, does that boost Tesla price?
Why not?
Lmao this guy thinks just because you made 30 trades that went well you're some expert and it's not all luck?

Fucking idiot. You can lose it all on one moment. You can flip a coin and land on heads 30 times, that doesn't mean you're going to land heads next time, dumbfuck. 

Also, I'm sure to that guy working at Apple, that's pocket change.

Eugenics is translated to "Good birth" in China. Maybe you can see why China did CRISPR baby now. Obviously you don't realize it, but Jews in Israel practice eugenics in the form of family planning to avoid diseases like Tay-Sach. 

>When the Aryan race uses the same justification and tells you that it's your genetics that make you inferior and burn the inferior products for the sake of greater good dont cry that it's unfair.

You know there are advocates for eugenics like R. A. Fisher, who pioneered biostatistics and coined terms like _variance_ that believe race mixing is good because it allows each race's best genes to mix together? You let your winners run, and cut out the losers.

And no, if anything, as a tech person in SV, I can tell you SF is a literal shithole, while all the Chinese coastal cities are actually all really nice and new, that is actually making progress.

The COVID-19 vaccine may spell the end of the pandemic, but while mass vaccination is not available it is vital to stop community transmission.

Lol what could they possibly be announcing after their 3 announcements this Q?

bro, we had 2 days last week where markets fell 1% and the dip got bought up hard as fuk, i just can't see -3% happening.
Eh a lot of major cities in Europe have cracked down hard on it. If you were to use it now for most major EU cities outside of the UK and Ireland you'd see a ton of properties removed from the listings that were up as little as a year or two ago. But I guess it depends on which listings in which countries they're getting most of their revenue from. If its NA, then that shit isn't going to change local govs haven't even begun to enforce fuck all here.

This place makes it so easy to stretch your cash and trades thin. Then we're unfocused, trying to pay attention to too much and not keeping our heads in the game.

We're due for a 3% down day and I think it's coming this week. Surprisingly I am properly positioned for it.
If it's managed well, the business could grow to a lot higher than $100 a share.

online business is very different from physical stores.

Looks like my Robinhood account than is 2 years old. I will leave the stock market to someone else and stick with aviation.
No, I mean it cratered on the news, not sure why people would expect the market to suddenly change its mind 🤷🏻‍♂️. Also the earnings report was good and stock still dropped. It’s stupidly overvalued IMO and personally (not that it matters much) but I thought the slack acquisition was dumb for the price. Everyone assumes anything Benioff does must be genius but I always felt he was mostly just a great salesman and a good bullshit artist. The product isn’t all that amazing. Just my two cents I’m usually wrong on my fundamentals anyway but when there’s consensus that the market isn’t confirming usually the stock goes the other way. I expect it to continue down. Stock has just been very weak and the market clearly did not like the slack buy.
Uh it was kind of a half joke. There's some fucked parts. Watch it but watch it at your own peril

First you gotta lose money before you can start losing money.
Pfizer is an mRNA vaccine as well. 

mRNA = messenger RNA. Cellular coding system used for the body’s 3D printers (protein factories) - ribosomes. 

messenger RNA vaccines carry a code to our cells to produce the spike proteins. That’s it. No active viral component. 

The body will recognize the spike proteins as foreign and form antibodies.
If it helps get deeper..... eugh
tsla stock is too high imo
And the haters say you can't time the market 😤
Nah it's a bullshit cult. If you are actually addicted to masturbation and porn (very, very few people are actually addicted) then it could definitely help.

If you jack off like once a day or every other day; it might benefit you in the short term and make you a little more motivated. But it's not going to magically solve your problems.

Just cut down on the hardcore porn.
It probably will reach 3300-3500 range by EOY/thru January.

LEAPs are safer in the sense you aren't forces to make critical decisions so quickly because expiration is right around the corner.

You can still get into a lot of trouble though if you are on the wrong side of volatility and direction. Also a huge risk of the bid ask spread widening and liquidity drying up.

Use the On Demand feature on ToS, his positions and orders check out at the exact strike and price, as well as option volume traded that day. Check the 1/15/21 680C on July 29, 2019. He purchased 2 that day and I'm assuming he bought another 2 in the subsequent 3 months while they were still under $1.15. His original cost basis would have been $1.15, so when the 5 for 1 split happened, each of his 680C would have been split into 5 136C with a cost basis of $0.23!

But consistently gets handouts from democratic cities like Chicago and NYC through budget restructuring and taxes. If it weren’t for democratic cities rural areas would be marginally worse off which would hurt everybody but yea let’s totally let cities die because they have higher populations and got hit harder by the virus.

Options aren’t the same as margin. If you have the funds to purchase the contract you don’t need to use margin. If you don’t have the funds you have to use margin. Brokers have limits and restrictions on buying options using margin. You’d essentially be multiplying your leverage doing this. Would not recommend it.

Based on maintenance margin I've seen for short puts, I don't think you could get to 300% leverage on something volatile like options. They put in limits based on risk, and liquidate automatically when you go under the maintenance margin (there are no margin calls, an algorithm closes whatever positions it likes).

What makes u say that and what strike??
This is easily the single dumbest take I'll read today. OP's helmet must be on a little too tight.

The "logic" this moron on Twitter is shitting out of his fingers is that COVID spike = Syncytin, antibodies to COVID spike = antibodies to Syncytin, COVID vaccine = infertility.

Literally wrong on every single point. COVID spike may share some [vague similarity](https://virological.org/t/response-to-ncov2019-against-backdrop-of-endogenous-retroviruses/396) to Syncytin in the primary structure, maybe. No indication that it does in secondary, tertiary, or quartenary structure. No indication whatsoever that COVID spike antibodies would target human Syncytin. No indication whatsoever that this would cause infertility. No legitimate clinical indication of fertility risk in any vaccine trial thusfar. This take is absolute garbage.
🥵🧣🥵
It's absolute garbage. "Here run our dell support assist shit that just says nothing is wrong every single time". Well since you have a warranty I guess we can send some schmuck into your home in the middle of a pandemic to put used parts in to replace your shit.

Over the summer they offered to have me send in my laptop to them for repairs. Without offering a loaner or anything. Not being able to work for however many weeks while the diddle my laptop would cost me so much more than just buying a new one. Dell is fake and gay and the absolute worst.

If you want to gamble I'll give you 3/1 odds on a coin flip.

Just wire me $530 and call it in the air.
The closer you get to expiration the faster they'll lose value (theta), so you need a larger gain in the underlying to make up that loss.

If you hold on for too long, even if it goes to 30-35 you'll lose money, so buy calls further out unless you think it will skyrocket by January.

PSTH will hover around 20-25 until Bill announces something. Rumors are that we'll know before end of year, maybe next week if we're lucky. So if that doesn't happen, your calls are likely fucked

They have been lowering nicotine yield, not content. Lowering the 'measured' yield is not nearly as effective as lowering the nicotine content of the tobacco.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC493271/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC493271/)

The nicotine yield of cigarettes measured by machine-smoking does not reliably predict the exposure of smokers. Smokers consuming low-yield nicotine cigarettes did not reduce actual intake of nicotine to the level that might be expected, especially for those heavily dependent on nicotine.

We have shown here that smokers of low nicotine cigarettes did not reduce their actual intake of nicotine to the degree that would be expected from the nicotine yield on the packages. Although smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.1 mg nicotine would be expected to ingest one-eleventh of the nicotine ingested by smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.9–2.4 mg nicotine (average of 1.1 mg), the average urinary cotinine concentration of the former group was more than half that of the latter (535 ng/mg Cr vs. 1010 ng/mg Cr).

&#x200B;

They've been raising the prices for ages now and that seems to help somewhat, but reducing the nicotine content to non-addictive levels would ensure the addiction is never created for new smokers.

I think the main issue with your post is that you leave out the fact that the people posting serious DD on this are being pretty upfront about the risks and the fact that it’s still a speculative play. I would say YOLO is the only serious poster who’s really gone into YOLO land.

The DD above, as you point out, is good but at the end of the day it’s all speculation. I appreciate the fact they have at least brought things together in a tidy way for the rest of us to see and make decisions on.

That’s said, and as DD mentions, whether it’s Stripe or not it’s gunna moon.

There’s just a lot of circumstantial evidence in favor of stripe. Also your WB stuff is particularly misleading and erroneous.

It's a monthly minimum fee. If your commissions are >$10 in a month you don't pay any extra.

1% interest on $10k is $100, so you'd save that if borrowing that amount for a year with Pro vs Lite.

I think you have to pay market data fees with Pro, they can be $4.50/month, level 2 data is more.
yuppp nice little balance on the edge of fire
Or perhaps they are simply taking some profits since we've quadrupled since earlier this year? Lol
There’s still a month left for 2020 to surprise us.
You need to understand that the day you buy the option, you are paying a price that is factoring in the current rate of growth in value expected for the stock.  For example, if you paid 800 premium for a stock that hits X by Y date, and it exactly does hit X by Y date, you will be out your 800 dollars as your option has no value when you exercise it.  If X hits Y+ the amount needed in order to save you 800 dollars, all you did was break even (except you were out your 800 dollars for that whole time and unable to invest it :P)  


An "accurately priced" option is one that exactly hits the needed break even price by the expiration date, but in the real world situations change due to new events being brought to light.  Say a massive increase in value due to one of X's largest competitors going out of business.  This was unpredictable at the time the option was written and/or bought, and so not priced in to the premium, hence the gambling nature of options.  

&#x200B;

You are "betting" that the market and everyone buying/selling the stock is wrong about the valuation.  Whether this be because you actually have knowledge or informed opinion, or your just a degenerate gambler with an addiction, is the reason you would take on the option.

Reading tons of bullish sentiment on the QQQs and Apple, specifically. So far AAPL and AMZN haven’t cooperated and seem to have lost all momentum, yet everyone “knows” they’re getting ready to break upward. I’m betting mega cap continues to underperform the market. Also seeing a ton of bullishness in CRM for some reason despite the stock trading like absolute shit for three months. Betting that too continues to drop.
Yeah so if you think it’s gonna moon you want to buy before it moons....

GME 329 Shares at 17.02$
Why ban??? I worked hard typing jargon
Thanks dude 🙏
The rise in GME share price this year is mostly a correction from its undervalued levels. Up 165% isn't shit when you consider it's still down over 50% on the 5 year. Also consider they did massive stock buybacks of 38% of existing shares at this point last year. 

So up 165% on the year isn't that impressive when you have 38% stock buybacks at the start of that period, then you got Ryan Cohen buying 10% as well as a few other major investors and other major catalysts boosting the price.

May I ask what your psychology was during the day(I’m assuming it was the day where you had a 200% run up before deflating)? I ask because I used to be in the same position when I didn’t have enough to for pdt and would refuse to sell positions after good profits. My cut off where I was willing to call it a day trade was +100% in one day. Between that and keeping 2 active portfolios(schwab and robinhood) I found that it’s easier to bypass pdt with smaller amounts of money, but you’re limited to bargain purchases until you hit a couple bangers.

You're obviously not a home owner, it's not that easy to sell and buy a new house.  I spent almost a year renovating and buying furniture and now I should just move out?  Airbnb is the one that should be pushed out, if you want to party go to a club or somewhere where you're not disrupting other people's lives.

I did some reading. Evidently, 'light' smokes are measured using YIELD vs content. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC493271/

The nicotine yield of cigarettes measured by machine-smoking does not reliably predict the exposure of smokers. Smokers consuming low-yield nicotine cigarettes did not reduce actual intake of nicotine to the level that might be expected, especially for those heavily dependent on nicotine.

We have shown here that smokers of low nicotine cigarettes did not reduce their actual intake of nicotine to the degree that would be expected from the nicotine yield on the packages. Although smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.1 mg nicotine would be expected to ingest one-eleventh of the nicotine ingested by smokers of cigarettes yielding 0.9–2.4 mg nicotine (average of 1.1 mg), the average urinary cotinine concentration of the former group was more than half that of the latter (535 ng/mg Cr vs. 1010 ng/mg Cr).

XXII is the only company actually producing tobacco with nicotine content at such a low rate. And they have dozens of studies to show that the lowered nicotine in the cigarette leads to lower nicotine consumption & absorption, vs with the light cigarettes we do not see the same sort of effects.
Because no one can accurately time the GME rocket's take off. We know it's going to, we just don't know when. In other words, buy shares.

Approval is in the hands of the FDA. Based on other companies and their timelines for MRTP approvals, we are right around the time when we should hear on ours. Given the pandemic and the vaccines and the state of everything, a bit of delay is understandable but unfortunate.

Interesting. I'm not sure what the best play is, but a bet on volatility increasing over this next couple months sounds like a pretty good one. I also like the play of just loading up on clean energy and buying the dip if there is one. Blue Wave or not, 4 years from now (even 1 year from now) I'm confident clean energy will be higher.
Rudy got the corona. Bullish?
So i havent reached Autism then, still got some time to get there?

Is the trade take both sides of the Jan weeklies (puts and calls) and hope that the gain in one pay's for the losses in the other?

So a few of the “dangers” of LEAPS that I’ve experienced which can be easily avoided if you just do your DD and know what the greeks actually mean are as follows
-Liquidity. 
Far OTM/EXP LEAPS for anything that’s not a major blue chip and or index have very low volume so you need to make sure that you get somewhat of an acceptable fill and can plan your exit accordingly.

-IV.
A lot of people forget that the further out exp just inherently have higher IV by percentage and can be subject to severe IV crush if market volatility is high.

So to give you an example of a leap strategy back in September I picked up some 1/15/21 SPY 370C for 2.30 at the time it had a delta of .23 and a theta of -.003. So that means for 230$ premium I paid. i have a position that would move 23$ up or down with SPY in correlation to the stock price so with a higher overall exposure with inherently less risk in capital because in order to mimic that same return with shares i would’ve had to pick up well over 32K of SPY.
Doing a lot of saying, but it's really just a bunch of wind trying to cover up the fact that you misread my initial comment.

Keep going, I'm still amused. For now.

I know you're hugely bearish on GME but no HF can hold their position in GME with an average cost under $15 and a quickly rising share price. There are risk management measures.

It's not like a long position where you can just hold through losses. Mark-to-market losses and margin will make it impossible for them to hold a position that is hundreds of percent underwater.

 "Chump gonna veto it if it passes and tell Fox News that the libtards ruined it" 

Also after re-reading your original comment it is quite ironic how from late July till the present the "libtards" are actually the one cucking a stop-gap stimulus package. Of course, you know this but for some reason won't acknowledge it.

Index fund retard here.

100% believe beating the market is not only possible, but doable on the regular. The problem is that extracting that market beating premium takes hard work. You have to put effort and intelligence into making money consistently just like any other job.

I'd rather be good at my job and make the beaucoup bucks there than learn everything I need to know to beat the market consistently, so invest most of my wealth in index funds. Still do buy FDs occasionally when I think I have a real edge.

this stock is so frustrating.  I can't really figure out what they do, but by looking at the chart, it appears so underwhelming.  In these days of easy money, and a large dividend, this company might as well be a local mom and pop.  They have 10 billion market cap, and there are way smaller companies out there that are less sophisticated, but have way more market cap.  Like TWLO for instance.

He paid $1.13 per contract.  And that's believable because I bought 1/15/21 $420 calls for $12 per contract.  This was when TSLA was around $240.  $680 calls when TSLA was $200 would've been in the buck or less range.

You have to remember TSLA was rangebound for like 5 years.  People thought TSLA would go bankrupt and very few thought TSLA would even break $400.  It's previous all-time high was like $383 or so.  $680 seemed crazy when TSLA was at $200 with all the bankruptcy talk.

Don’t compare me to poors who still use toilet paper and regular blankets.
Besides stimulus and re-opening, a major near-term catalyst I'm not hearing enough about is the Georgia run-off election January 5th and the two possible outcomes.

1) Republican's preserve at least one of the two seats: This is the more likely scenario. This will result in a short term blow to Biden favorable stocks. The last hope for a Blue Wave will be snuffed out. The chances of marijuana being federally legalized diminish, and prospects for clean energy lose their luster on the short term. At the same time this will be a bullish long term catalyst for the overall market given that the Biden administration will not be able to hamstring corporate America with as many policies, and the status quo would be mostly preserved, which decreases uncertainty and thus encourages investor confidence. This could also be a short term bearish catalyst because it makes it unlikely that we get as large of a stimulus bill.

2) Democrats steal both seats: This would be a shocking and less likely scenario, but far from the realm of impossibly. This would result in the fabled Blue Wave. With Democrats in full controll of the executive and legislative branches, it will be four years of pumping out Democrat policies with little holding them back. This would be extremely bullish for specific sectors, weed and clean energy being the most obvious ones. It could also be bullish on the short term due to the possibility of a large stimulus package. However it would be a bearish event for the next four years and we could enter into a long bear market as corporate America and Wallstreet seek to protect their wealth from a Biden administration.

Pay close attention to how it plays out, and place your bets accordingly!

You have balls man. I wouldn't have thought of putting 5k worth into INTC contracts.
True, that works, until it doesn't and you have to B-T-C as the LEAP would be worth too much. I wouldn't devote more than 50% of an active portfolio to LEAPS. Buying shares (at that point), you can get more margin, divs (lol) and sell true covered calls at a strike you'd gladly sell your shares at.
My friend in India didn’t even get back his covid result and its been like a month.
Dude didn’t lie, the calls were trading for $1.15 last July when Tesla crashed to $200.

Do the math. He bought 6 of them for $1.15 each and post split had 30 contracts (5 for 1 split is 6x5 = 30 for the tards who missed the news). He sold off 10 of them and holds 20.

At the time he was guessing Tesla would more than triple from $200 to $680 by January and he got lucky.

TLDR- Does  a "pass" on a college transcript look like a mental midget of a  student? 

So a fairly "well respected prof." has  been saying it would be a good idea take a "pass or fail" if a grade is going to hurt your GPA. Meaning if you have a 3.82 GPA even if you got an A- in a class take a "pass" (just in that specefic class) and just tell interviewer's "it was pass or fail becuase of COVID" and "it will be no big deal" according to the prof....IDK seems kinda sketchy and looks like you can't take a "loss" and realize growing pains to an interviewer (less to talk about really actually learning imo too) but my prof. has a point. What do ya'll think? Take pass or fail or just suck it up and take the B or B+. I have a 3.8

Look at your current favorite stocks and look at the value of Leaps in the past year. Chances are they are worth less now than they were a couple of months ago. To break even on a $50 dollar LEAP you might need a price of $60. If your break even is double the stock price, why not just buy shares and double your money?

LFMAO. Why don't you read the Plomin review? Even just the subheading would be great. Plomin is arguably the top authority on Behavioral Genetics. IQ is one of the few behavioral trait where the heritability actually increases with age.

>Socioeconomic position (SEP) is a multi-dimensional construct reflecting (and influencing) multiple socio-cultural, physical, and environmental factors. In a sample of 286,301 participants from UK Biobank, we identify 30 (29 previously unreported) independent-loci associated with income. Using a method to meta-analyze data from genetically-correlated traits, we identify an additional 120 income-associated loci. These loci show clear evidence of functionality, with transcriptional differences identified across multiple cortical tissues, and links to GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. By combining our genome wide association study on income with data from eQTL studies and chromatin interactions, 24 genes are prioritized for follow up, 18 of which were previously associated with intelligence. We identify intelligence as one of the likely causal, partly-heritable phenotypes that might bridge the gap between molecular genetic inheritance and phenotypic consequence in terms of income differences. These results indicate that, in modern era Great Britain, genetic effects contribute towards some of the observed socioeconomic inequalities.

Feel free to believe whatever you want, but I truly because the west is on the decline compared to China because of people like you who categorically reject a fact because it's fucking thoughtcrime. And let me tell you Chinese people doesn't have that white guilt complex like you do, and Xi Jingping is someone who have the emotional maturity to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.

>The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns states that wherever it has been studied, children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers. The correlation between IQ scores and grades is about .50.

>According to Schmidt and Hunter, "for hiring employees without previous experience in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability."

 >The American Psychological Association's 1996 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was −0.2. It was −0.19 between IQ scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large Danish sample; with social class controlled, the correlation dropped to −0.17. A correlation of 0.20 means that the explained variance is 4%. The causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect. Children with poor scholastic performance may feel alienated. Consequently, they may be more likely to engage in delinquent behavior, compared to other children who do well

>Multiple studies conducted in Scotland have found that higher IQs in early life are associated with lower mortality and morbidity rates later in life.

CCL has no business being above 15 right now but you can probably hold it until 25 or so just on a purely technical basis.

I do expect that it will go below $15 again but saying when is the tricky part.

Eventually, this company may pose an actual systemic market risk. 

The amount of shares that institutional buyers are accumulating to write these insane call options is extraordinary. At some point, owning 5,000,000 shares of a company trading at 100x trailing revenue is going to catch the attention of a risk desk and there is going to be an unwinding with retailers holding extremely heavy bags. 

For instance, AT&T peaked at $57/share in 1999. It has literally never recovered that price in the intervening 20+ years. At that time, the world was convinced that they would take over the planet and there would be nothing to stop them.

WSBGOD is probably legit. He makes the calls and then post the positions before he makes the millions. If he was just photoshopping fake trades, then he's probably the best paper trader of all time.
Sell to open ITM puts that you won't get assigned.
No, I'm talking about the way WSB memes a stock. 

When the discussion goes away we're not meme'ing it anymore.
Sure. Life is about taking risks. But it’s also about having backup plans. Max out your retirement accounts, lower your AGI, take that sweet tax write off and put it into risk.

I got so lucky, I had my app open two weeks ago watching PLTR and a guy I know asked me about it. He bought 8 contracts right there for 31c expiring day after thanksgiving. Thank fuck it opened high and he made 80%, was obv able to sell before it shit the bed
I agree sister
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the 3rd grade math, and I've been involved in numerous stonk raids on down jones, and I have over 300 confirmed losing plays. I am trained in buying high, selling low and I'm the top shit poster in the entire WSB sub leddit. You are nothing to me but just another boomer. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of autismos across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid.

Not only am I extensively trained in printing tendies, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Federal Reserve and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Use a real trading platform.

In fidelity active trader you open the chart for the specific option and then just change the date range. I have another reply in this thread showing it
This is called the option *style*.  American-style options may be exercised any time up to and including their expiration date.  European-style options may only be exercised at their expiration date.

American-style options are available on exchanges based in Europe; the terminology is potentially misleading.   There are many other option styles used in the OTC market, but these are the two you'll encounter with vanilla listed options.

Capital gains are less under trump administration if Beijing biden gets in he’s raising it and you’ll get cucked in the ass ... thank you democrats! I love high tax rates 😘👍🏻
Not the govt but maybe the exchanges. My worst fear is them adding collateral requirement needed for exercising the options you buy. Boom game over.
You also realize that short sellers are paying to borrow right? It's not like holding shares where you can hold forever and it costs you nothing. 

As less shares are available it gets harder to short and cost to hold the short increases. Eventually it gets to a point where it's more expensive to hold the short than it is to take the loss.
No but selling the one behind it is, say we open red tomorrow I just buy back the shorted contract for a cheaper price and collect the premium, technically I still hold my call and got paid for its decline.
That shit is fake af. The all time chart he posted was clearly photoshopped (if you increased brightness and zoomed in you could see there were text boxes and other edits). If the all time chart is faked, I have a hard time believing the positions image wasn’t too

This is an exact replica of 2000. You are married to this position, and you will ride the sled down the mountain when it finally cracks.

The idea that Tesla is going to command a full 20% of the entire worldwide automobile market is absolutely ludicrous. I am not sure how sub-Saharan Africans will be affording to purchase these automobiles, not to mention the fact that China is absolutely not going to allow Tesla to gain a foothold there. 

Further, there is massive competition for self-driving automobiles. You think that Google is somehow behind on that front? They started their Waymo project in 2009, whereas Tesla only began their autopilot program in 2013 or 2014.

Tesla exists to do one thing: increase its share price.

CRSR calls or shares?
My only issue with 10% compounding is having to wait til my body is old and decrepit to be able to enjoy the fruits of my labor.
You have the option TO BUY 100 shares each at the specified strike price. So $72 * 100 shares = $7200. $7200 to buy 100 shares IF YOU exercise the option. 

You only exercise if you want to own the shares and have the capital to purchase the option at its premium + 100 shares. Most people sell the options instead of exercising.

What’s the best chance of big returns to buy LEAPS in tomorrow?
Yeah that's exactly what you wont get with AAPL calls. Lol.
Ok thank for the info bro. So here is what I would:

If you are ok with less risk; Sell the $25 12/24 if it gets there (give or take .50c) by this Wednesday. That should allow you to sell and get approx 30% of total value. Let the others ride until the following Tuesday and then bail for the pennies left.

Your first comment is misdirecting blame and villainizing Trump by implying he is the one who is cucking stimulus. Had someone not been informed about the developments surrounding stimulus, they would likely come to the conclusion that Trump is the problem. That is what I dislike. Stop being dense and admit that was the original intention behind your post. The way you say "Chump" says it all.......
You only posted a picture with words on it that I can see. No title, no follow up, no citations.... why don’t you post some of that and we can talk about it.
If you see someone degrading someone based on race it is okay to call out their racism. You don’t need to know the skin color of someone to call them racist. White people are not the only people that are racist. There are racist people of every skin color. African Americans, Asians, native Americans, Hispanics, Europeans and everyone else can be considered racist, and their beliefs are what makes them racist, not their skin color.

I'm pretty sure it did.  TSLA hit $373 or so back in Dec 2018.  So lot of higher leap option prices got released then.  TSLA tanked over 50% and hit low of $179 on June 3, 2019, I think and I'm pretty sure leap options were dirt cheap because all the FUD about TSLA going bankrupt.  The negatively and FUD was insane back then and everyone hated TSLA.

More leverage is GOOD if you have "so much faith in a company". That's exactly when you should use the power of options for more leverage. You're not making much sense. Go educate yourself bc it's painfully clear you have no idea what you're talking about. If not and you're simply opposed to options, WTF are you even doing on this subreddit? The whole point is to make high risk high reward plays and share in the pain or glory.

I guess future competition could arise. Currently there’s VRBO, owned by Expedia, and I vaguely remember a site called CouchSurfing that I think is free and nobody uses. CouchSurfing is also more social and geared towards actually getting to know your hosts. Weird IMO.

I wonder if being in The Economist has prompted the SEC to legit monitor this thread. If so, Hi   
guys! 👋
SHOP, ZM and SHOP are all growth companies with +80% revenue growth yoy. PYPL is „only“ growing ~25% yearly which is still great but it has clearly more or less matured. Also EPS means shit for these kind of companies as most dont even have a positive net income because they invest heavily in growth.

Even if it was reinvested you still need money to live on. Conservatively following the 4% rule that gives you 40k per year plus dividends minus taxes. AT MOST you’re living a life where budgeting is still a priority. 3 or 4 million is really where you can begin thinking about retiring while also having some room to diversify your self sustaining income

Great douchebag post. Let me guess you went into PLTR this past week.
I know you’re stupid and highly impressionable, so I don’t anticipate you’ll get much (or anything at all) from this, but maybe someone who isn’t you will, as you are regurgitating false information that is easily and quickly debunked with even a small amount of effort.   

You can find the study that the false claim you are repeating refers to right here:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599911/pdf/nihms76103.pdf   

If you go beyond your original research (of reading and believing your pedo uncle’s Facebook posts) you will find that this study makes no mention of masks let alone reusing masks. The study posits that many, if not most, of the deaths in the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic were likely caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia infections resulting from the primary infection of Influenza A, and not the Spanish Flu/Influenza A, itself.   

It’s a bit like determining that jumping off the roof of a building doesn’t cause a jumper’s death, secondary contact with the ground causes their death.   

We all have bacteria in our lungs. We all walk on the ground every day. Respiratory illnesses can cause that bacteria to flourish and become bacterial pneumonia. Falling from the height of a roof can make contacting the ground a much more painful experience than going for a walk.

Honestly. 

The development wasn’t THAT accelerated. It really wasn’t.  

mRNA vaccines have been the “next thing” for vaccine for several years. The reason for the excitement about them is that they will be much faster and more flexible a vehicle to deliver the vaccine. 

So, the groundwork was done.  All they had to do next was figure out a target for the “payload”.   

That portion was sped up considerably by having a concerted effort in the medical/pharmaceutical community INTERNATIONALLY. 

Basically China gave us the viral genome from day 1. That saved months. 

This  was a worldwide effort. 

Second, production started BEFORE the vaccine was finished and authorized. That was a HUGE gamble. Yes, it would have to be scrapped if the vaccine didn’t work. But the US Govt gambled that it would be good. And it worked. 

Lastly. mRNA vaccines use the human body to produce the antigen (target for the immunity). This is MUCH faster. Otherwise, viruses have to be grown in chicken embryos deactivated/processed...etc. That actually takes YEARS to do. 

That is why mRNA vaccines are revolutionary. We can bypass that whole growing step.

False: "Do you think that I hold you in some regard where there is value to me in proving anything to you? I think you have a Napolean complex and that you sound arrogant. It's fun that you keep going, but it has gotten a little boring now."
Did you even look at historical price action and then adjust to current day variables? Its right on the chart OP posted. This time is not going to be any different except that the longs will benefit more.

$100/share is 6.5bn market cap. That is what GME revenues in 1 year. 1.5bn will be coming from e-commerce sales that usually receive a 2x multiple from the market. That is $32/share on its own and only represents <20% of total sales. It's not like $100/share is even a wild valuation.. Focus on market cap not share price. I swear you guys think all stocks start at $1 and are somehow priced accordingly to that.

GME will be getting to that price with help of the shorts exiting when it hits max pain soon enough.
Tesla first to produce an EV that can run on gas this is truly remarkable science
No hasn’t even ran yet. Pt 20-30 by eoy. Look at the dd posts on here.

I don’t think the bear analysis about AMD is going to be the death of Intel. I think it’s going to be NVIDIA and Apple with ARM... Intel is completely behind with new CPU architecture. They are already trying to resist change by trying to ban i86 emulation just like IBM was with PCC.
I think the rule is the grosser and more boomer the UI the more money or something like that.
That's not what I said.

There's no guarantee they do a raise and given how beat up it is,  puts are risky as well.

Longer term calls is the play.
How does it compare to teams? Teams is the go-to and I don't really see that changing just because CRM integrated it. Teams is also practically free bundled with their other softwares. How will they make a good convincing price point to sell slack services to the customer that will ever justify the acquisition. I liked CRM stock until they announced the acquisition.
You’re the only individual person I’ve actually ever claimed to be racist. If you’re asian from Asia you will understand that there is a ton of racism tied to asian cultures. That is one of the reasons my dad raised me and my brother with an American culture instead of Korean culture. Racism= no good. I will happily call out asian racism against other asians. And you don’t need to know the race of someone to call out their racism.

“Averaging down” SPY weeklies is what killed me
It’s been dead around here lately every since people got wiped out in PLTR
You buy 100 shares of say, AAL, then sell a call for a 5% higher strike price 2 weeks out. You can't do anything with your 100 shares since that's collateral, but you pocket the money from the sale of the stock option. The worst case is the stock falls hard enough to where the current price +5% is less than your initial investment, since at that point you will lose money if you sell a call and the call is executed, so you either have to bag hold until the stock price goes back up or sell a call and possibly take a loss.

&#x200B;

Otherwise the stock basically stays the same and you just pocket the money from the sale of the Call, or the call is executed and you're forced to sell your shares at the strike price (still profit) and you still have the money from selling the contract. Then you have to re-buy your 100 shares at whatever price it's at now if you want to go back in
Eh, only if someone is naive and inexperienced. 

I had precisely one girl like that, and cut bait because she was looking for commitment after she had just gained like 40 pounds, and I was 27 and just starting to make really good money and had absolutely no interest in settling down. Lo and behold, like 12 months later I saw I saw on social media that she had found some dude and they were getting married. 

I can't fucking imagine being married to that chick right now, I'd probably be completely numb to the world. Honestly, the fact that I was single through this COVID bullshit is one of the most fortunate things that has ever happened to me.

But Brokers can force shorts to cover the short. They may not get a choice that’s how a short squeeze happens. You think all the short sellers who had to buy share of VW at its peak in the short squeeze wanted to? Everyone new the company wasn’t worth being one of the highest market cap companies in existence but for a brief period it was.

Anyone remember using YouTube for the first time? I typed in "sex" and it was a POV video, just some gay kid humping his bed. The funny thing is this would have been like 2004 so this kid would have had to get his parents digital video camera transfer it to the computer and burn the files, convert them to then fucking upload them on dial-up internet. It's not like he just swiped once on his iPhone hit record and sperged out his bed for a minute, then hit share. He actually went through all this effort to upload this gay video. I can respect that.
Hey, I’m really new to this so I appreciate this post a lot. I have a question: I have $500, how many GME shares do I buy now and how much after the er? Thanks so much!

All kidding aside, your options or YOLO shares plays should be a tiny part of your portfolio. Like the straight up gambling part, because that's what you're doing. If you have a fully funded Roth and/or 401k and also want to do some fun trading/gambling on the side, go for it. But don't mortgage your future because you think you can beat the market.


Buy index funds for your retirement and watch them grow over the next few decades. YOLO bets on PLTR, GME, and TSLA calls in your fun account because it's fun and even morons can get one right once in awhile.
Puts on your company. Find something better bro.
Has to be lol fuck all those spacs😂
Well you’re right but I’m already down 80% and there isn’t much left. The calls I have are 28 & 29 exp 12/18 and 25 & 29 exp 12/24. Even though the SP seems reasonable, I bought the calls at the top. But if they reach close to it, I can cut my losses from this calls and profit from my other calls which I got for much cheaper. Still sell ?
I just told the waiter to get me an IPA for all I know she probably slipped a roofi in there
Thanks for clarifying retard. I’m not necessarily shitting on CRSPR as a stonk - just your belief that it’s going to move 100% in the green next month without any catalyst - a drug approval would be a catalyst that can typically move a biotech stock by this magnitude  but you’re referencing at positive data read out from a not yet completed ph 2 study...

This is just one of the many price that we will have to pay for stopping COVID. Don’t take me in wrong way but, the main goal right now is to control its spread. It’s not out in public discussions, but am ardently sure that governments around the world don’t care about any effects that this vaccines will have in future. No wonder the development of a vaccine to novel virus took just 7-8 months with expedited approval processes. Stopping is all is cared for right now, not saying vaccines won’t work, they will and are already having bigger success rates for us to roll out in public.

Another price we are going to pay is human behavior change and seeking more isolation in this already isolated time/world. We have changed on a mental level after this virus. 

Good god, am so retarded for writing this in wsb.

Jesus, OP is asking about LEAPs and safety and you don’t want to factor in growth of the underlying in an instrument designed to replicate the underlying with a leverage factor. Yea, you can risky up your choice of strike and underlying to leverage your tits off, but the reason it’s risky is because you could have a continuously depreciating asset with dwindling marketability and decreasing IV making you lose larger sums of money than near term options. This market currently is fucking insane but we absolutely could return to the 02-06 market.

why the fuck do you keep buying puts?

I hope so. It will save me from deciding to buy at $60 off the rip.
GME is not worth $100 a share so why would a short try to cover at such a ridiculous price instead of just paying the margin call and wait for the inevitable correction back to realistic numbers?

Say it hits $100 and all you guys try to sell your shares who is going to buy them? This will lead to paper hands retail slowly lowering the price down trying to get out of their long before it drops back to a fair number. All the shorts have to do is wait for that. If no one will buy at 100 then people will sell for say 95 then no one buys and they drop to 90 and so on and so on. 

Your entire plan is based on the shorts panicking and buying at numbers that we all know are un realistic in relation to what GME is actually worth.

oh my.... i don’t know about it going to 250 but it definitely has a large gap to fill and a great graph so it’ll make its way back up hopefully
I’ll be happy if it goes up a buck or two. It’s dumb how you can’t expect it to ever moon, but yet it’s totally possible for it to reverse moon to $0.75 a share.

Gahdamn that’s good. I’d gild you if I didn’t already lose all my money on PLTR yolos
Anyone who is too sure is going to lose. I have 5k in those april 30c. If green monday might sell and put half in shares then wait for the shorts to attack to buy calls.

Politics aside, based on your previous comment you're making it seem as though Trump is the wrench in the deal when in reality he isnt. Id say most of the blame goes to Nancy (who is actually ruining the finances of Americans by delaying a stimulus that could have been approved 3 months ago for the sole purpose of making Trump lose the election). McConnell is also delaying things but was ALWAYS willing to accept a 500 billion interim deal which of course Nancy refuses to accept.

Yes it is. And I should not have been such a lazy fuck and wrote out the rest of the details. I like ATM leaps because with a tiny increase they are ITM, which then hold value though ups and downs. This is a nice balance between the breakeven price and the ability to hold value over time.

Index funds are for people who can't beat the market so they come up with stupid modern portfolio theories and all sorts of self gratifying academic bullshit to justify and praise their mediocrity. These people are the finance world equivalent of parents who want every kid on both teams to get a fucking trophy. Even Buffet thinks its a stupid idea. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJzu\_xItNkY&t=97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJzu_xItNkY&t=97) 

That said, ETFs are great if you don't know what you are doing and want to be safe, and for that reason Warren also like ETFs because it makes average gains accessible to stupid people like you and me.

I buy a lot of ETFs because I am stupid. But I have learned to pad these gains with options and companies I feel strongly about from time to time.

the replies made me laugh, and even though I got eaten alive for posting, I learned my lesson lol I have a lot to learn about stocks
Yes
To be fair I think those statistics are misleading. 

Options are designed to lose, that’s the whole idea, and mostly what they’re used for by the big financial institutions. It’s like homeowners insurance. I don’t pay my insurance and then cross my fingers that my house burns down. I pay my insurance, basically with the intention of throwing that money away and taking a loss.

I’m not sure how the numbers are being put together that I always see people trot out about “95% of options traders lose money”, but if they’re including all of the people who buy options as insurance with the intention of throwing that money away, the way you do with any insurance, then the stats they’re presenting about options traders losing money is wildly misleading.

You also have to consider that with every person who trades a spread, even if they win on the option they bought, they simultaneously have a loss on the contract they sold. If you’re just looking at trades and not considering dollar amounts, you could say that trader had a winning trade and a losing trade, so in they end they were neutral, when in fact they came out ahead.

Again, I don’t know how they put those numbers together, but there’s a lot of ways you could make that data tell a disingenuous story.
Says the guy with paper fuckin hands
not saying it'll hit 300. that I think it is too much? but going from 50 to 80-100 range the day of its ipo is very likely, and I would be hesitant to buy shares when it hits 100 this early. I will wait for a pull back. The hype has been unreal.

I assume its intent/design was to be able to monitor current positions. It's not their try at a mobile focused trading solution, or i would hope not. They need to release something for new gen of traders wanting to get off robinhood, like SwimorDrown.

During a volatile market, like the one we are in, LEAPS are the best way to go imo. 

If you have a reason to believe a stock will be much higher months, or even a year from now, LEAPS will pay you handsomely compared to buying stock.

That said, they are a lot riskier. 

Weeklies are for degenerate gamblers who think they understand what’s going to happen to a stock on a day to day basis. So essentially all of WSB lol

Here’s the real question: did they buy the right calls?        

Food for thought: institutional investors make up the largest share of options traders. Institutional traders tend to trade options as hedges against their own portfolio positions. That is why you tend to see markets trend the other way of call:put ratios.

The only potential in this stock both short term and in current outlook is driven by hype.

You’re contradicting yourself and taking articles describing relative demand as valuable. “Let’s not think about COVID, think forward.” “But Google Airbnb COVID demand”.

Not that I made any specific point about this, but rural properties are less plentiful and much cheaper. So demand for “Rural Rentals” and “Getaways” will not balance out loss in Urban demand, and this will evaporate as the need to get away from urban density due to virus eases up. Case in point: their financial losses in 2020.

Looking forward further:

1. They’ve completely scrapped or put on pause most of their diversifying aspirations, and went directly into survival mode within the first quarter of the pandemic. Travel services, experiences, property management, real estate ownership.

2. As a consequence, they are, for now and the foreseeable future, operating to compete as and against hotels and nothing else. The last thing you want for an attractive tech IPO is for them to settle as a regular competitor in a long-standing and existing market

3. Regarding hotel competition: Prior to COVID, large potential line of business for Airbnb was growing acceptance in business travel. Which will have a large chunk permanently erased with permanent tele-commuting capabilities.

Gotta run, but you see the point. I haven’t done the data analysis, and again anecdotal and word of mouth, but I have friends who are longstanding engineers, data science, Strat planning at Airbnb, and the ones left are the ones reflecting the above sentiment. Might also not have been you, but someone mentioned that the regulatory concerns are relaxing — and that’s straight up not true.

Not to say the IPO can’t go well. Look at fucking NKLA and Hertz and all these other meme stocks.

No you referenced “cancer” explicitly in your now conveniently removed post
I dont know all those fancy words but I buy them all the time.

Example:

AAPL - current price - 122.12

7/16/2021 50c - premium 72.50

Intrinsic Value: 

Difference between $50 strike and $122.12 stock price is $72.12,

So you can buy this option and purchase the 100 shares for $5000.00 then instantly sell them for $12212.00.

Extrinsic Value:

Premium - Intrensic Value

$72.50 - $72.12 = $38 in premium (0.5% of premium over 6 months) less than 0.1% per month. 

Additionally the delta is 0.9899, you make every dollar the stock goes up and you can get 3 of them for control of 300 shares for the price of 200 shares.

Diversify with $100-$200 of cheap calls so you don't lose everything. XOP, XLE, and XLF calls for vaccine approval. ZNGA calls look good to me, too. Then you have $300-$400 left for day trades or new opportunities.

Of course it's possible to beat the market for some period of time.  People do it all the time. Most people can't tho because they don't understand how, nor do they care to learn. And that's fine. They should do index funds. 

If you lived 10,000 years it's doubtful you could beat the index for that entire time. But we don't live 10,000 years, we live maybe 100 and we invest for maybe 30 of that?  You only got to beat it for a few decades and then retire. People do that all the time.  Some get lucky, some get unlucky. And skill and knowledge makes a difference but not ALL the difference.

Think of it like poker, you can't win every single hand and luck plays a role, but guys make a living playing poker because they have something everyone else doesn't.

No, an inherently failing business model is, for example, one that is not profitable. There’s room for both streaming services and movie theaters. They’ve coexisted for over a decade. I agree that the buyout poses risk to anti trust, i don’t know how to solve that one

this airbnb motherfucker is going to hit $100 before options even come out at which point, it'll be already too late. fuck this ipo shit.

ngl if OnlyFans did IPO it would probably not be a great buy because zero moat and if they really do grow enough to warrant serious tendies then other companies are going to get in on it and grind their margins down

Gosh, you are stupid. Did you know it was Nancy Pelosi who REFUSED to negotiate a 1 trillion stimulus plan that was McConnell's opening bid? They likely could have worked out a deal in the 1.2-1.5 trillion dollar range had Nancy been willing to come down from her RIDICULOUS 3 trillion-dollar proposal. 

Furthermore, leading up to the election Nancy also refused McConnell's 1.9 trillion dollar offer, even when her party members advised her to take it. She is the one holding up stimulus along with McConnell, Not Trump.

You could, but that shouldn’t be the expectations. Depends on your risk tolerance and timing. It should be expectations of nominal stock growth with an added compensation for risk. Normal growth would be 10-20% and add a 30% risk factor on top.

Netflix started streaming content in 2007. Here we are in 2020 and people are still choosing novel movies in theaters over the same old convenient Netflix content.  

Absolutely theaters are comparable to movie-themed amusement parks with regard to brand building as well as how much revenue they generate. 

The theater is where the Disney experience begins. Little kids learn about the Disney multi-verse and it’s characters on the big screen, and later beg their parents to take them to Disney Land where they can freely interact with these characters. 

In Q4 2019 (pre pandemic), Disney made $6.7B from its parks and resorts, and $3.3B from its studio.

Robinhood is legitimately easy to use and has a great looking mobile app. Clean and simple.


Robinhood is also the most retarded company in existence. It's shocking they're allowed to handle their own money, let alone anyone else's. They fucked up and forgot to account for leap year in their software code. Trading around daylight savings time is always a risk for the same reason. And they routinely go down just when you need to execute a trade. People on here have some serious horror stories.


But yeah, I use Robinhood.

RH is pain. I have ToS up on my monitors and sit there using RH on my phone. Limit sell triggers on RH work 30% of the time, even if the call has a 20 cent bid/ask spread and u set the stop .20 below ask (at bid). Lost almost 1k of extra gains on friday alone because of that. 

Besides having to fight citadel algos on every low interest/volume call, they have endless bullshit. Nickel and dime increments cuck you from doing cheap otm yolos. You can't even buy FDs on Friday's. 

That said, I'd never want to make some of the plays I've done on my TDA, RH provides you visual xanax so you can calmly do the trade that shouldn't work but makes so you a lot. ToS mobile is an awful app, I'll give you that. Almost as bad as RH website.

Not true at all, and the reason it’s not true is the same reason bogle made index funds.

 Median stock returns ~2% a year. Index funds average ~9% a year because 4% of their stocks account for 91% of the gains offsetting the fact that the other 96% didn’t perform well. (This maps pretty closely to studies indicating ~95% of stock pickers underperform the market). Also, 40% of stocks return negative a year.

If you already have an Ameritrade account then identify 3 or 4 diverse, dividend preferred stock positions,  (energy, tech, retail, finance) that you absolutely want to hold long term and not really look at it.  Put majority of your money (70%+) into those holdings via Ameritrade and withdraw the rest of your money for RH or WeBull for active trading.    Robinhood gets a bad rap because of the sheer volume of inexperienced traders that use it but it honestly makes daytrading very fun, the UI is clean and free of clutter so it makes tracking and selling options much more efficient and enjoyable and doesn't have nearly as many order/transaction fees as Ameritrade

see i've been on the buy the rumor sell the news train regarding FDA approval, but based on M1 half a trillion increase and M2 stock velocity, I think the news is gonna cause a face melting pump like the first Pfizer vaccine result did except the price isn't going to come back down. I'm excited and hope everything just rips up

Again, you are the only person talking about race. You placed race into the conversation so that you could try to use it later. I brought up your Napolean complex and then referenced a stereotype to give you the opportunity to jump on race - which you did. This is a common tactic for you. You probably had success with it and now it happens unintentionally - but it happens, doesn't it?

Alright I fucked up last week and lost almost everything. Down to my last $600. What’s a solid play? I threw it into long AAPL calls.
Probably not. Orwell wrote people to be the perfect form of whatever trope he was ham-fistedly trying to convey. They dont act like recognizable persons, and as a result his models of dystopia are ultimately unrecognisable in most respects. He did have a deep understanding of basic social structures. His creations are like someone who new what a lego build was supposed to look like but only used square bricks. Huxley understood the nature of the human animal, and Brave New World is a masterwork in reflecting an absurd result of that nature. Neither was predictive.
There’s a median to building wealth imo, like I only have 1 stock that’s a growth stock that has no competition risk, no fda risk, no regulation risk, good growth, good ceo, good financials, high upside, and positioned perfectly for the future. Aka Tesla or Apple. So knowing this it’s not really a risk to me so I can pick one of those to put my entire life savings, DCA, 401k, etc into. So when Tesla does 700% like this past year (during a market crash) I will increase my entire net worth by 7x plus by only next year, now think the next 5 years.... it’s the power of capital efficiency and Dollar Cost Averaging on the right company in order to build true wealth. Diversification is for keeping your wealth once you have it. Capital efficiency is for building wealth.

Knowledge is power.

I’m all for CRM calls, but don’t you think with the recent sell off plus tech trading flat, it will uptrend at a slow pace? Like 240 by Feb so slow
Ok and how much are you working with right now
Hahahaaha
Lol nobody is getting the check.
Think of it this way.

You are paying a large premium to give the stock more time to "jump". If you buy a far OTM leap youre hoping that at some point the stock gets a crazy bull run.

If all the stock does is slowly climb up over time, you may lose money from theta burn and iv drop.

Also you need to be careful of the bid/ask differences. Unless youre getting options on an ETF you could end up buying an option well above the mark.

You could try to use that to youre advantage by the way....try to buy an option for below the mark, and then just sell it for a higher price.
Hahahahah

Hmm the thoughts of someone self centered in racism? Lawsuits related to wrongful death happen no matter how rich or poor someone is in most cases(within developed countries). The fact that the more money someone has the more money their family receives in a wrongful death lawsuit should not be surprising, nor should it be surprising that the cost of court expenses would increase dramatically as the wealth of the victim increases. The relation between wealth gap and increased court costs is something you will see in every country, including developing nations.
Thanks!

INVERSE THE NEWS 

good news? Stocks go down?

Corona mutates into a zombie virus and dead people start reanimating? Money printer go brrrrrr tendies for all bulls
Lots. They are actually in a better position then they were before the beer flu hit. Pre rona share price was around $46, current price is $41. They were already heavily discounted before the rona though mind you. So $46 isn't a resistance level, it is a support level. Meaning there is almost no chance this thing dips more than a few $ without a serious catalyst. You have potential upside of $100+ with very little downside risk. 

They are going to start paying dividends again in 2021, which means yield on cost at these prices will likely be fantastic. That's huge. They are becoming the new becky supercenter with their new athleisure product lines and the Sephora deal as well which could lead to huge growth. They are going to capture market share from JcPenny and Macy's in the coming years as other retailers were caught on the backfoot by the virus. 

I predict this stock could go to ATH within a year due to pent up demand and new marketing initiatives.

No. Fed won’t let it happen.
Risk tolerance.. Index funds are highly diversified and work for a majority of people who prefer a low-maintenance, passive style of investing. With that relative stability of risk comes a relatively lower potential gain.. Generally, the higher the potential for failure for a given bet, the higher the risk, therefore theoretically the higher potential gain.. Rarely do you find massive losses on subs like r/investing, and likewise do you ever see massive gains. WSB in comparison, you see both massive gains and massive losses.
Ok is the stock name bitches or bigcock someone help!!

They’re slightly more risk than buying stock straight up. Obviously if the stock goes down the can expire worthless. If buying OTM, the stock could trend up early and then flatten out below your break even. Add in if you’re doing LEAPS on a dividend stock that your missing out on those.

Good news is you can run a variety of strategies to either reduce your cost basis or make income while the leap is in play. You would need 100x shares of a stock to sell calls normally, but you could sell further OTM calls and turn it into a PMCC 

The gains shouldn’t be expected in the same range as FD’s or short term trading and should be targeted more as an investment, I.e. 15-30%. Obviously timing matters on leaps as they aren’t decade long holds, so aim for entry at resistance  on the daily chart.
Don’t insult Idiocracy like that that. You’re tarded.
are you saying he turned a profit?!
[removed]
Only danger is opportunity cost and time value of money. If you put everything into 2023 leaps, and say in 3 months you're $20 ITM, are you really going to sell with 2 years left, esp if it's clear a winner? How are you going to get tendies in 2021 and 2022?

LEAPS are great but too smart for us to go all in on because we're impatient af, which is why we trade weeklies in the first place.
Just follow the red lines it’ll lead you to heaven

TLDR
A couple of diametrically opposed thoughts encroaching on market outlook for the next 3 months -

\*we have a vaccine, we're saved

\*# of deaths expected to double from 275k-ish currently to about 500k in only 4 months, likely spawning more lockdowns

MMs likely to use either outlook to push the lines to the points that yields the most profits for them.  I expect a reasonably active kangaroo outlook, fairly unpredictable, with minor news having outsized influence on the indexes.

Eh, you have no point beyond and opinion. I see what you are getting at but my opinion is that it is not up to the government to tell people to be healthy. 

Do you get mad at Taco Bell when it gives you the shits? No, because you are accountable for the choices you make. Yet Diarrhea kills hundreds of thousands every year. 

I understand being proactive to not spread the illness but again, it is not the government's job to force citizens to stay healthy, it is the citizen's responsibility.
I know little about blue states, but people in red states will not accept a 2nd lockdown.

I made a nice profit buying RKT on IPO day and then dumping it shortly after.  Haven't really looked back since.   That was just one example of how IPOs spike and then drop.  Other examples are BYND, FB, GOOG (yeah I bought that one too).  Then the good ones go up and never stop.  As you say RKT is junk.  Time will tell for AirBnB.

That’s what I’m sayin looks like there’s going to be another serious lockdown and then they’ll get the vaccines rolling after - but this might be a nice hammer blow to the market - although I think it’ll be a lot less harsh then the earlier - now that the market realizes that tech only gains from lockdown - but I’m thinking maybe go short on rty because retail should gap down
With Covid and every other trash that 2020 has brought, I haven’t had the patience of getting into arguments. I simply just ghost the person, either for the day or long term, depending on who they are. Too much other shit to worry about.
Yes, and yes lol. But understand that you have a time limit on that investment and have to be prepared to lose everything if it does not reach that point.

How we think THICC B is gonna do next week? Has there been any talk of when the merger will actually be announced?
better to lose 22% than 99%

also i've had spreads down over -80% that i cut my losses on, but had i not then they would have expired fully ITM 🤷‍♂️

it depends

I dont think of ta as rules, just quite interesting how often these things work out. My favorite indicator of price movement., so far, is a crossover of 13 amd 30 period sma on and hourly chart (13 is avout 2 trading days 30 is about 1 week). Especially if they have not crossed for a few weeks, and even more so when they are crossing the 200 period as well. Works for bullish and bearish. Of course the news drives the stonk cycle, but the algos buying in between def have some kind of equation for buy and sell. If only we could find it

The 900 billion bill seems promising.  The election has passed and i don’t see the political jockeying playing as much of a part.

Definitely in the minority. More and more positive news on vaccines and more and more reports that the flu numbers are getting lumped into covid numbers and it really feels like people just don't care about numbers anymore, just want to vaccine news.

Guys, looking at $SPY lower and lows and higher highs - is this a pattern forming?

+ Jan 2016 $203

+ + down Feb 2016 $186

2 years stonks go up

+ up Jan 2018 $286

+ + down March 2018 $258 

+ up Sept 2018 $291

+ + down December 2018 $240 

1 year stonks go up

+ up Feb 2020 $337

+ + down March 2020 $228

+ up Dec 2020 $369, possibly higher

Will $SPY go lower than $228 at the next dip?

Usually real estate market crashes happen ~1-2 years post stock market crashes. It is yet to be seen for this one (if it even happens), but I can tell you that many commercial RE companies are nervous. 


In regard to millionaires getting rich in financially burdened times, just know that RE is the easiest way to maintain wealth. It’s just buying during bad times leads to greater profit margins in the future should the market swing your way.

Don't forget the fun of selling calls then watching the stock break out and jump 20 points, while you stare at your $22 in premium.  

Of course at that point, you could buy them back for 30x what you sold them at, or roll out and get stuck waiting for 9 months, during which time the stock pulls back to below your purchase price.

It's free money until it isn't.
true. but chasing 100x baggers are useless in my opinion. youll get the same way chasing 1/2-1x baggers and you can actually do it with skill instead of hitting a roulette table
Possible... there are beautiful autists out here who made 1.000.000 from $500 ...

If it doesn't you are fucked, thats why its dangerous. Same issues as any call option, just spread out over more time. Look at the market since 2018, there have been lots of big drops... You leaps will rise and fall too. I prefer ATM leaps to hold long term because edit: "with a small price movement they become ITM and theta doesn't degrade ITM leaps" like OTM leaps, edit: " which I find provides a nice balance between the final break even price and managing theta". When it comes time all I have to do is pay my broker a small fee to exercise them and give me the cash in return.
That’s exactly why I posted this, like who cares.

The max pain point is on the top chart where the bars are smallest. This is the point most of the contracts will expire worthless. The further out you go, the option writers (usually Market-Makers) will lose more on their position so they have incentive to try and close the stock price closer to the 'max pain' strike price. This is just a theory and can never be proven. Personally I do believe it happens. Maybe not always, but sometimes.

Agree that our date formatting sucks. I use yyyymmdd wherever I can. Fahrenheit does offer one benefit, it gives us something to argue about. Since it makes precision easier when it comes to the temps you care about, we argue about the ideal house temperature, 68 vs 69 degrees. I’m pretty sure that’s all just a single number in Celcius.

In my area it’s super cheap. I get a weekly 10-20% off and free delivery so it’s like $3 more than going and doing it myself because of a tip.  I ordered food 2 days ago, checked on every app and called to check prices since I hadn’t been there before, it was all the same as DoorDash already had so I only paid for the tip of the driver extra.

If you’re not a dumbass it’s not expensive, they have coupons daily.  I only order food like once a month though because I’m not a degenerate and like cooking

On the bottom chart the right side y-axis is the value of premium expiring. Those colored bars at the bottom are the value of premium at the strike below max pain, at max pain, and strike above max pain. You can see a spike in volume of the bars every 4 weeks because of the amount of premium expiring on a weekly option contract vs that of a monthly option contract.

That's why I decided to track the premium as well because you will notice on a monthly or quarterly expiration (like qUaD wItChIng), the amount of premium expiring is exponentially larger than that of just a regular weekly contract. The next big expiration, actually quad witching, is Dec 18 which has huge amounts of premium related to options expiring.

Max pain theory is just a theory because it implies markets are manipulated to cause max pain. My theory with is it that MMs will let some of the weeklies expire at a loss for them as long as they can recoup some losses on the monthly and quarterly expirations. For example, a weekly option for SBUX might only have $10 million in premium expiring, whereas the quarterly and quad witching will have $1 billion expiring so they will focus more on driving price to Max Pain on the quarterly instead of the weekly with less premium.
How’s my VALE gang doing

When do I give you my venmo dad?
50pip stop loss and 150pip take profit. A pip is one piece of the currency used to measure currency exchange. So in the example I gave the EURUSD at $1.2505, so a single pip would be where the *x* is in $1.250x. 

50 pips is a moderate stop loss, or an automatic close of a position on the downside that you set to minimize risk. 150 pips as a take profit is 3 times the stop loss, making for a moderate take profit, or an automatic close of a position on the upside to, again, minimize risk. 

Using $1.2505 again, a 50 pip stop loss (SL) would close the position at $1.2455, that way if the trade goes the wrong way you expected, you don’t lose your account. Your take profit (TP) would be at $1.2655, so you don’t get greedy and think “oh it’ll continue upwards” after moving 150 pips. 50/150 are good numbers for a solid strategy. Some people like to play with a little more risk and will opt for 75 SL and 150 TP, but it’s up to you. 

Hope this helps.
Not confident enough to buy LEAPS on anything at the moment but if I hear about a rising company that I expect is trading at low IV currently and anticipate a rise I'll look at them and research them in more detail.

I am watching some companies such as LAZR, BB, and CRSR

But I won't be trading them right this moment. I take a very cautious approach and try to stack all of the odds in my favor before entering a trade. That way I feel I'm less likely to be wrong, and when I am wrong, it's not a big deal because I'm not going all in on anything.

> I know. But i still think LEAPs give you a better chance of coming out with a big gain than buying calls 1-3 months out.

LEAPS give you a better chance at giving you a gain, but weeklies give you a chance at giving you massive gains with a 10x risk of losing it all. for every 1 leap that gives you a 10000x gain there were 100 weeklies everyday that did it

This is how I see the stimulus going. Pelosi, “we will not ask for anything less than 2.2T.”  Mitch, “Well fuck you. I’ll only approve 600B.” Talks stop. Mnuchin, “Come on guys, we need to stimulate!

You know why this 'covid crap' has gone on a year and our numbers are worse than ever? Because people like you refuse to do your part.

People will choose convenience over novelty every time, theaters will stick around but nowhere near the capacity they are at now. You literally can't compare Disneyland to theaters, those are tourist attractions that families will plan their vacation around. They bring in billions of dollars alone and build brand in a way that theaters can't live up to. Disneyland is an experience, theaters are a place to watch movies in the best quality possible. This is just a burden they don't need, it would be a bad business decision.

You buy in and the stock goes up which is great, but every time you buy in you're decreasing your break even margin... At least when it's going down you know you're buying cheaper than before but buying in an uptrend makes me feel weird even though it's a perfectly normal investing strategy.

Generally when companies file, they intend on using it. It's a risk.

I know. But i still think LEAPs give you a better chance of coming out with a big gain than buying calls 1-3 months out. I will never touch FDs. But for example i bought SPY 280 12/18 calls back in like April for $3.00 each and sold for 13 or something a month later. They’d be like 11k each right now 😩
Yes - but I am not sure why he would do that. 

The politics here aren't great. It is unlikely that treasury is going to strike a multi-billion dollar settlement with shareholders in the middle of COVID when the admin and congress can barely get their act together on stimulus spending. Plus this would unsettle the mortgage market which is a bright spot in the recovery. 

It is likely that SCOTUS will rule this whole Obama era regime unconstitutional. This is a ruling that Republicans welcome because it will set a precedent that hamstrings the Biden administration's power to do something similar. 

So at the end of the day - I agree that the current structure is coming to an end and that FNMA has the potential to pop, it just won't happen under the Trump admin. Look to Spring 2021 for the court to rule on this. Get in now if you think the price is attractive.

Exactly. People forget that what is often called "toxicity" "Negativity" or "Bullying" is just a natural and healthy response mechanism designed to reinforce pro-social behavior and discourage anti-social behavior. One of the reasons I'm concerned for Zoomers who never have to face anyone be mean to them and why I think Chris Christie's decision to ban bullying from schools is one of the worst decisions he made (besides giving out massive tax handouts to failing companies.)
It's at an all time high, so yeah. Just make sure you wait for a big drop to sell

I never liked Uber but everyone holds it up as a failed company so I think it’s funny that even though most people I know went from taking multiple Uber’s a week to none during the pandemic they are at all time highs as everyone whines there was no possible way to not lose all your money on the IPO

Meanwhile if you sold covered calls you’d have broken even a lot quicker if you were so worried and literally bought the top of Uber which was a total scam company with their “self driving cars” that killed one person and then got canceled

Filing that just gives them the option to do it quicker and easier sometime within the next 3 years, if and when the market conditions are favorable to do it. It definitely does not mean it will happen anytime soon....or really, even in that 3 year period because they can also file for an extension. It’s just a good thing to do and have sitting there in your toolbox.

Well this isn’t a bailout, it’s a buyout. And it’s not a failed business model as much as it suffers from government-imposed restrictions to help with the pandemic. Yes, streaming is gaining popularity, but the theater business is still big business. It makes movies *far* more profitable than streaming services due to ticket/concession sales, which means greater innovation and more jobs in film and production. For these reasons i’d argue that the government has a responsibility to allow theaters to be bought.
Huawei was the industry leader. Now that they are pretty much banned it’s left a big hole for Nokia and a few others to step in.

Level 1 is covered calls and cash secured puts, level 2 allows you to do options trading so that is long calls and long puts. levels are there to better protect a broker in this case Robinhood, from too many people losing big positions on the market and people filing for bankruptcy in which Robinhood would have to take the hit of the money you lost

As far as egos go, wouldn’t trying to use race to belittle someone else go under the classification of ghetto or trashy? “Let’s not get into stereotypes about sizes or anything” I mean, why not? Race has nothing to do with size of anything, but congrats on displaying your apparent racism. You have truly shown the depths of how poor you are and how low you are willing to stoop to try and win in a conversation.

The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism is a fictional book in George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). The book was supposedly written by Emmanuel Goldstein, the principal enemy of the state of Oceania's ruling party. The Party portrays Goldstein as a former member of the Inner Party who continually conspired to depose Big Brother and overthrow the government. In the novel, the book is read by the protagonist, Winston Smith who recalls that "There were ...

youtube idea;

This seems spot on from what I’ve been looking at.

Looks like as much as a 10% correction coming up followed by another run up through 21 as industries recover to precovid levels.

However a correction may be minor, if any, as vaccines ramp up and stimulus is injected into the economy.  This is helped along by FEDs interest rates remaining low.

If they botch the stimulus bill before they go on leave the 18th, expect to see the downturn start.
Those spreads though 😩

You need $125.13 for break even right now.

If you think $125 is possible, you could sell the $126c for $0.61 as of right now, meaning you only need $124.52 for break even.

In this case, you’d be legging into a debit spread since they’ll both expire on the same day.

The big question is whether 124 is going to hit for you or not.
I have no idea, but a 1% rise over the week is entirely possible.

Creating a spread would limit your potential payoff to $1 - net debit of $0.52, so $0.48/ contract.

If you think $125 is a sure thing, sell the $126c, or higher.
Happy cake day, fren!

You know everyone knows GME's earnings report is going to be dogshit, right?


At the very worst, we'll all make money when it bumps to $25 by April. If it starts dropping back to $17, we'll all dump it. No one is gonna hold it past April if the Q4 ER doesn't pump it up.
They are... somewhere.
Would you guys throw money into TQQQ now riding into Q1-Q2 next year? I think AMZ and Apple Q1 earnings are going to make a huge pop

Why? Why wouldn’t it go up to 240 or higher? Good news, news sales, yeah  the Dreamliner production cut by 1 a month isn’t great.  But also vaccines - even if rolling out slowly means that the demand will return
[removed]
The market has risen pretty far from the most recent low in November, the rate of growth should start to slow. The question is do we see a 5% pull back before that happens. I don't think so. The market have been more volatile the last couple years and is more prone to larger movements both down and up, the turbulence in 2018, followed by the huge run in 2019, followed by more turbulence in 2020... and the pattern repeats. Get ready for lots of overvalued claims, record high valuation headlines, and doubt to become even more prominent (as hard as that is to believe). We will eventually have another large correction, at this rate its likely to be late January unless the market slows down a bit.

You're still able to view the historical data of the original strike, same way you can see the data of the post split strike.

But that matters much less than the fact that the guy has been commenting nonstop for the last 24 hours saying he's sent verification videos to "random jerk skeptics" while refusing to send it to anyone else that requests. Post the video or shut up about it. Saying that random people (who totally aren't alt accounts) have seen it proves nothing. He could easily share with a mod to verify but again, he's only sending video "proof" to randoms.

The guy put too much effort into avoiding requested verification while putting a ton of effort into bickering with the people asking for evidence. It doesn't add up unless he's full of shit
That because you can never call anyone out because your response and all the obnoxious replies will be there for the World to see.

 I wouldn't dare call her out as that would be bullying but also none of my business.

I know people with the type of money people like yourself would refer to as “a billionaire” which in your terms means someone with exceedingly more than a couple million dollars. Saying you know specific people isn’t saying you speak like them. I’m saying you need to open your perspective to think more like them. I like how you try to act like everyone else has ego issues, but you fail to learn your ego says one thing but your bank account proves another. Keep talking about egos because in a world of haves and have nots, you definitely align with the have-nots of the world.

Everyone responding to you is a fucking idiot.

IV is an indicator of investor sentiment with regard to the probability of a price movement. The higher IV is, the more likely that the price of the security is going to change.

You also want to be familiar with IV Percentile (or similar depending on your platform). I use think or swim and it shows the 52-week high and low as well as percentile for the year, in the options chain.

To extrapolate on that:

If you're talking about High vs Low IV of a specific security, you want to use IV Percentile as well as historical High and Low IV. If you're comparing the IV of two different securities, you can just use IV.
This sounds like Foxconn I’m out.

I'm not sure what you mean but what I'm saying is that historical option data for TSLA (or even APPL) on many of these websites are wrong because of the split. 

The you'd need Thinkback on TOS or find a broker that properly tracks options data in both pre and post split.

That's why for this website, that data looks fucked, they ended up combining charts from what another redditor said.

You try to act as if you’re smart but you fail to bring up any information that makes me think you graduated high school. Again if your pride is in being a grammar Nazi, I can refer you to a high school dropout who is an aspiring author that used to make $2 above minimum but is now close to homelessness.       

“From the moment I joined Reddit I have had no intention to post information” yet you try to say you will compare statements with me but don’t have the balls to back it up when asked to provide proof. Probably the same reason you were denied a mortgage(couldn’t provide proof of income).

Hmm yes I see your logic and present to you stocks only go up
I haven’t seen the ticker I’m on this week mentioned here a single time so I searched for it and it’s only mentioned on here like twice over six months ago, so weird, it’s kind of a re opening play, but also kind of a fintech play, kind of a travel play and kind of a gaming play, it went up thirty percent last week and the chart is the that perfect consolidation line, that little tute bump and then parabolic, it only just started its parabolic run, it’s one of those small caps that’s gonna bounce from ten to twenty in a week, and the options premiums still so cheap even after a big week.

If there's an absolutely massive NKLA sell-off this week ya boy will be ordering a Huracan, otherwise I'm doing some serious bag-holding
Per contract:

Call: Right to buy 100 shares at the strike price you choose and expiration date you choose

Put: Right to sell 100 shares at the strike price you choose and expiration date you choose

Example: Buy 1 AAPL call $130 Strike 12/11. If AAPL closes at $140 you make $1000 ((140-130) * 100)
Damn hope you banked

There are tons of articles contradicting your, as you say, anecdote. 

Of course demand in major population dense cities is down since there is nothing open and its high risk for covid, but it's soaring elsewhere rural and more secluded getaway type places, perhaps not for the holidays as much but we don't know that yet. Post Covid demand will be higher than ever. 

You have no valid argument that I see, again, it's as simple as googling COVID AirBnB demand to see A LOT of support behind the company and their future potential

Why are two Virgin shills making identical wrong arguments in two different reply threads to the same post? I'll tell you exactly what I told the Joey guy. Virgin has demonstrated zero capability to compete with SpaceX. Starship's projected launch cadence and capability vastly outstrips all satellite production in the world, so if tourists want to pay for a Starship launch there's no reason it won't happen. You have this set idea in your mind as to what Starship "is for" without understanding that rapid reusablity makes Starship the DC-3 of rockets.

Damn, is buying shares and selling covered calls just free money? Buy 100 shares at $31.52 then sell a 05/21/21 covered call for $7.90. If it gets exercised you made 50%, if it stays under $40 your cost basis is like $23.62
Yup. DXY is below 91 now and it’ll likely break below 90 soon enough. There’s no incentive for the big money to be on cash or bonds. The only other thing giving a similar return as stocks are shitcoins, but the risk there is much much higher. Hence, stocks have become the “safe” bet.
My January 30c are bleeding right now, but I’ll hold. It’s the kind of stock that can randomly have a 50% week. Float is basically locked up by institutions so a little buying pressure goes a long way.

 Index funds with nearly identical portfolio mixes and investing strategies can have different fee structures. Some index funds charge [front-end loads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/front-endload.asp), which are [commissions ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp)or sales charges applied upfront when the initial purchase of an investment occurs. Other funds charge [back-end loads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/back-end-load.asp), which are charges and commissions that occur when the investment is sold. Other fees include [12b-1 fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/12b-1fees.asp), which are annual distribution or marketing fees for the fund. However, the 12b-1 fee can be charged separately or be embedded within the fund's expense ratio.

Ive been debating all weekend if I should find a lower stress but lower paying job since I am consistently making way more trading than I have been working. 

I loved my job and was making great money, but they cut my overtime and now im starting to get crap about not being as productive.I get called on my day off to be bitched at about why something got scheduled for monday, they wanted it done on friday. When you take away 20% of my work hours, I get >20% less done while working, who could have guessed. Either give me back my hours(which at this point I don't want, Id rather leave at 2:30 and make a days salary in the next hour) or hire another person.
Okay, first of all, you're just wrong about what Starship is "for". Starship has an estimated launch cost in the single digit millions. If someone wants to pay for orbital tourism, they'll get orbital tourism. If someone wants to launch 100 tons of ice just for the sake of launching ice, ice shall be launched. Starship's orbital capacity will vastly outstrip all demand for years, they aren't going to turn away paying customers.

Secondly, although competitors exist, in order to compete you need to *be competitive*. Virgin Galactic has shown zero capability to compete with SpaceX. RocketLab is closer to competing with them. SpaceX is building a Saturn V sized rocket that will still be the cheapest ride to orbit, and they're in the final stages of development. The engines work, the aerodynamics are mostly settled, and they're rapidly prototyping vehicles. They've built 15 Starship test articles so far.

What does Virgin have that makes you honestly think they can compete? What evidence is there that the "orbital spaceship" has left the drawing board in any meaningful way? To develop an engine that competes with Raptor would take years, maybe a decade.

Nah, that shit is so deep in the money he’s a millionaire regardless of what he does.

If he exercises the calls he gets 2000 TSLA shares, currently at ~$600.. 600*2000 = 1.2 million.

If he sells the contracts he makes $926,000.

So this is one of those instances where it’s much better to exercise the calls than just selling them. But he’s a millionaire either way. Problems I wish I had lmfao

Decides to sell to diversify or secure profits, stock goes up 10% the next day.
True, might make more sense to wait until it settles a bit, but I think long term gains could make up for a potential IV crush. I'm tempted to get in ASAP just because I can see a lot of hysteria pumping the stock in the short term before a level off, I want to lock in those gains... I'm sure it will experience more periods of high IV that might be even higher than the IV it's currently seeing (which is high, yeah, but the stock traditionally has high IV).  Probably leaps for 7/16/2021 or Jan 2022 (they're expecting more clinical trial news sometime in 2021). Not sure though, it depends how crazy things get before open Monday. I'm on the fence. Might just buy some shares Mon and hope for a drop in IV  to get into 2022 leaps.
Yes but you saw the effect mass hysteria and feedback loops can have on the market in March, at which point retail made up a much smaller percentage of the market. Since retail is more easily influenced by mass hysteria, if there is another major sell off like in March, the outcome would be worse. As such, assuming everything is priced in is a dangerous game.
The stock market is not the sum of an economy, many many businesses are not public and not in the stock market - nearly all small businesses, and a couple large ones.

> fuckery if the value drops too low 

If you mean a margin call they're required by law, not Robinhood.

The legal maximum on leverage is 50% but a broker can set those limits lower based each stock. Like TD only does (or did when I last checked) 30% on Disney.
It is known
Yes. I prefer buying OTM personally.

I've made >300% gains on premium by trading INTC $70c when INTC was below $50 and not expected to even reach $70

Just because. 

It doesn't have to be ITM to make money with this strategy. 

And the increase in value can be huge with very little underlying change sometimes.

This is why high volume stocks with >10 million average volume are good because of liquidity and being able to get in and out of these contracts.

If you're trying this on stocks with too few people involved then you might be stuck holding contracts without buyers. So I aim for stocks like INTC that have even greater than 25 million average volume

1. It’s not a small profit margin. 2. The theater is more than a revenue stream for Disney. It’s a cultural epicenter, similar to Disney Land. It is absolutely in Disney’s best interest to preserve the theater business

Your last point is brilliant, and one that I could not see being new to options. I have no gauge of how expensive option pricing is relative to even last year.

I sure hope so. Don’t bail out a failing business model. Capitalism 101. Just because AMC goes under doesn’t mean that the theaters they lease or own disappear, it doesn’t mean that the projectors and the screens, etc just disappear. Someone else can come along, re-invent and innovate the theater industry (or whatever the next iteration of it is), and then the economy and consumers are better off. Watching movies is not going to disappear tomorrow because AMC goes under retard.

It’s the same shit with airlines. Don’t give them billions for being over-leveraged and not appropriately managing their finances. It incentivized tired, old, un-inventive, and anti-innovative practices that suppresses long term growth. And long term growth is the only thing that matters. Let the shitty businesses fail and let someone better take their place

Edit: I guess I agree they could be bought up, just not by Disney because of anti-trust shit. And if it’s between them failing and dealing with anti-trust, let them fail and have someone start over in their place. Gay monopoly is more problematic long term than a failed theater

Funny how people believe this guy.  He has no clue how to look at this. I’ve provided more detailed videos to skeptics who have a clue. DPanda doesn’t understand how options are priced by share rather than cost per contract. Pretty incredible.
No. We’ll get another correction sooner or later because we’ve had a ridiculous run-up, but the lockdown has no relation to the market.

Ballsy and/or lucky. I assume you bought after their 2nd earnings dump. Sentiment around INTC was that they’re ruined by bad mgmt and losing their footing for 6 months, so shitty earnings weren’t really an overreaction, and they rightfully traded sideways for over a month after that. Even AWS with whom they have this new partnership that served as a catalyst for this recent run is actually moving away from Intel processors to cheaper alternatives. Why is INTC all of a sudden a “hot” company is beyond me. The only logic for such moves would be reversion to mean.

More seriously - why didn’t you buy leaps, if you believed in INTC, but bet that they’ll recover in only 2 months? They’ve basically recovered most of their post-earnings losess in the last 2 weeks. Would that have been more or less profitable?

It is the same. You can have short and long term unrealized gains in 2020. As long as you don’t sell the stock in 2020 you don’t have to pay tax
All good. If you have 400 shares, you can sell 4 contracts of PLTR (covered call). 

For instance, as of Friday's close, you could sell the 12/24 $35 for $55 apiece. It would both give you some cash ($55 x 4 = $210) and lower your cost basis from $32.50 to $31.95.

The risk, of course, is that if PLTR rose past $35 in the next 3 weeks (I think unlikely), but if it did your shares would be called away and you would be left with a total profit of $1210.

The upside is that you can sell calls every few weeks and make money while chipping away at your cost basis.

Yeah I am pretty passive these days but when I was more into it I was just kinda trying to think of myself as a mutual fund manager, thinking about sector allocation at a high level and then trying to pick some winners from within each area (although let’s be honest it was 80% tech). Just don’t ever try to get cute and think that you know something that the market doesn’t, or at least don’t count on outsmarting the market on a regular basis.

Okay but even so, the guy holding 75% of the bag controls the action. That’s my whole point. MMs are constantly hedging positions and buying new shit, and if they don’t want it to go higher it doesn’t. Retail can’t drive up the market alone. Banks are along for the ride too and will basically veto price action if they don’t want it going higher. They’re called Market makers for a reason.

interesting interpretation of the Gulag, I like it
Yes, 90% of the plays I take ive used flowalgo one way or another to choose that play.

The problem is that alot of people dont have the time to do what I do, which makes things harder. But I stare at flowalgo every. single. day for 6 hours. Its literally on my third monitor 24/7. You also need to be able to read option chains, and know how the money is flowing. Once you get good at the game, its not too hard to understand if options are being sold/bought/hedged etc. Sometimes it is, but othertimes its clear as day. 

I am a big believer in just following the money. If I see an unusual amount of call activity on one ticker on flow algo, especially if its a smaller named stock on a red day, or has a bearish chart it usually flickers lightbulbs in my brain. A recent example of this is VALE. I cant tell you the amount of buying I saw on Vale a week ago while it had a -5% day, jumping into plays like these with no other background dd but just from flowalgo has never failed me yet. (it doesnt happen often, but when it does Ill notice it)(and i dont all in every play, i follow risk management rules etc. im here for the long term)

Since that day in a week vale has jumped almost 2$ (~20%)

I was also seeing similar buying in Uber/lyft over the last week of november which I jumped in. (look at it now)

Sometimes I will use it to confirm my own watchlist plays. But the highest success rate Ive had is literally looking for mass call buying on stocks that have bearish momentum or a deep red day. And the reason for this is because usually when a stock is dying I will always see put flows coming in. When I see a stock on a -6% red day with 100% bullish call volume, it means INSTANT BUY.

At least r/WBSers recognize that a life of employment is fucking gay so we’re trying to finesse our way out of that fate into beautiful early retirement. These linkedin drones live for employment. Updating their resume is like their favorite past time.

Gonna buy some GME 5p expiring 2022 at market open.
I do not need a roommate, I live in a four story house on the Hudson. Thanks for the offer though. 30 minimum hold sucks yeah, but I can still sell covered calls to lock in profits if I want so it's kind of like the minimum hold isn't even there.
Ecommerce rev is usually given a 2x or higher multiple by the market. GME will have 1.3bn-1.5bn in ecomm sales. That alone equates for about 3bn in valuation, or $32/share. These sales account for <20% of total sales.

B&M 4.5bn rev at 0.45x will equal another 2bn in valuation, plus 800m in cash, plus inventory = 3bn+

There is your 6bn+ market cap. Or $100/share. This is not giving GME any sort of special treatment or high multiples. It's just fair market valuations given their revenue numbers.

Unprofitability, shorting, negative sentiment, and covid had driven this stock into the ground. Now it seems as if all of these things have changed or are changing for the better. Total company turn around is delivering good results so far.

Don't forget to factor in Ryan Cohen and his plan to grow GME into a ecommerce category killer. That is where even further speculation and growth comes into play.

TLDR GME will be over $100 within 12 months for many reasons. This does not account for a squeeze.

But yes
But there will be, the question is what?
I feel you, and that is a possibility, that's why this is stocks, there is no predictable future besides opinions, a lot can change what happens to companies even out of their control and out of the market's control.

But I am Bullish on Intel and I do not believe the bear sentiment is justified. They will go up, even if they're failing, because they're Intel. That's just how it has been for companies too big to fail historically.

Besides when I read this kind of news, I'm very confident about INTC going forward:

> Rising competition will always be a problem. But Intel has so much more manpower, resources and experience than anyone else in the CPU game. The company should be able to leverage those advantages to formidably defend its leadership position over the next few years. So, while Intel may never again enjoy a monopoly of the CPU space like it did five years ago, the company will forever remain a very important player in this market.

> And losing “monopoly” status is just fine, because the semiconductor market is on the cusp of enormous growth throughout the 2020s, as we increasingly pivot to a technology-driven society built on the back of CPU chips. So long as Intel stabilizes market share in that booming market, revenue growth trends will remain healthy.

> Meanwhile, gross margin pressures will ease as Intel finally scales 7-nanometer chip production in 2022. Brining these chips to market will help Intel win back higher-quality, higher-margin business, and will therefore, provide a material boost to the company’s overall gross margin profile.

> Big picture: Intel is down, but certainly not out. Over the next few years, this company will bounce back from what appears like a very precarious position today. As it does, INTC stock will rebound with vigor.

https://investorplace.com/2020/10/unimpressive-intel-earnings-are-no-deal-breaker-for-intc-stock/

> But Intel’s stability might be better suited for our current market and it is prepared for the future. “One year into our long-term financial plan, we have outperformed our revenue and EPS expectations,” CEO Bob Swan said in prepared Q4 remarks.

If you’re gonna leverage yourself, why not buy shares, sell otm covered weeklies and use some backup money to buy leverage against your own position through puts? Personally, I don’t mind wedge trading, but Tesla’s IV is so high for anything expiring before January that it’s really negligible from a % standpoint unless Tesla has another -7% and +8% days back to back allowing you to play the volatility both ways on a wedge.
It’s just salty people who didn’t get in early or who lost their money on weeklies. I got 1100 shares at ipo and am very confident with holding for a couple years. Rome wasn’t built in a day.

Omfg never considered that but.....
lmfao I know right. & there’s a bunch of confused people in this thread calling this fake because I suspect they also don’t know how to read this.

There was a 5:1 split between the time he bought this (Summer 2019) and now. So we can find this call’s strike price at purchase from the breakeven - cost ((136.23 - 0.23)*5X split) = $680 strike.

These were TSLA 680c 1/15/21 bought Summer 2019 when TSLA was trading for like $220. Way way out the money with a year and a half of theta. 

Now that we know the strike we can check it out ourselves, and the Open Interest is 22,000+, which means that while OP owns 20 of these calls there’s still 21,980 of them still being held out there
Yea... Locked downs are priced in but vaccine news since June arent..

I disagree with the retards that think some massive squeeze is pending; the share float is way too high and smart money can unwind slowly. But I also disagree with the people who ignore the strong fundamentals. GME is cash positive and actively transitioning to meet a lot of their weaknesses. 

I don't expect some massive spike but I do think it's undervalued and for that reason I'm long
Any predictions for pfe this week? Does it seem like it’s still undervalued with stock price
Do you think that I hold you in some regard where there is value to me in proving anything to you? I think you have a Napolean complex and that you sound arrogant. It's fun that you keep going, but it has gotten a little boring now.
Retail investors are the ones pumping stocks by buying in at all-time highs, not banks.
Good luck, have fun :D
Definitely healthy market.

I will buy calls dated a month out, and puts dated a year out
You're welcome. Here is some more info:

I feel bad that OP's so poor that he has to buy fractional shares of a stock that's worth $24 :(

Thoughts and prayers peasant!
I also think people here have forgotten that GME is a p&d play, or if you really believe it a short squeeze. Not an actual earnings run up play 🤦‍♂️
Yeah. Just checked long&black.... Nuthin'
They need the trivago guy to make this stock moon.

Can you imagine being an MM?

You spend all of May through Sept and claim there's going to be a double dip recession and you dont even have to ever acknowledge how fucking wrong you were.
Current price is $122. It’s way above your average cost. You need to decide what OTM call u could sell 30-45 days out. I can’t tell u what to sell, that decision is yours. You should know that there is always a possibility that the u r exercised.
LMAO. You're insulting the guy while posting wrong information. For most people who owe taxes every year you're required to pay quarterly estimated taxes if you expect to have over $1k in investment gain tax liability.
Uranium market is going to the moon this month mark my words

They could adapt, but console is on its way out. Steam has it all covered on PC and they’d be late to the party.
Agreed the name is wank but it looks decent. Looks like Zelda BOTW which was a savage game
I buy OTM because the trade off is lower premium, but also lower delta and vega, yes.

That's where you have to determine your risk tolerance and expectations for the underlying, as you would normally with any trade.

Nah there are lockups
i dunno if Brrrrr is even accurate at this stage, i dont think its loud enough

this is like a nuclear missile sound of money being pumped in
So GME is going to run up bigly into earnings right?
IV crush and theta are not real things just like any other fundamental variable when it comes to TSLA and the sheer volume that follows it

its literally the ultimate gamble-meme stock, it will either go up or down and there is absolutely zero TA that determined its' buildup to this point, and there will be no reliable TA that determines its' future path either.
Lost Planet Extreme Condition lol
Agree.
If Trump/Mnuchin had managed to get Fannie & Freddie out of conservatorship this year then 2020 really would feel like the Twilight Zone. WSB will have a field day when it can play those tickers again.
May have a quick pullback to reset the ratio a bit before continuing the SPY climb
snow is going to get absolutely demolished on the 14th with employees who’ve been paid in shares can start to dump them.  the current squeeze has to end soon
Better yet let’s start a hedgefund and you can all deposit that money into my account and I’ll manage it for you, guaranteed 200,000% returns but you can’t touch the money for 2 years

Lmao really we knew about lockdowns last week, do you think Goldman Sachs with its superior information channels somehow didn’t know about them before you did?
Downies before uppies. I was hoping it would go to $40 too, but it’s time to embrace reality - it’s a $20 stock for the foreseeable future.
Money printer go Brrrrrr
Same. I’m in on both as well. Love it

Yes also worth noting that China and Europe both tried to clone Airbnb for ten years and largely failed. Wimdu was a super well funded German competitor which went under entirely.

https://skift.com/2018/09/27/airbnb-clone-wimdu-to-close-despite-having-raised-more-than-90-million/

I think they’re trying to revive the brand but it’s really sad
IMO both are bad but bioshock has a better story.
It really [doesn't ](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/08/07/more-pain-than-gain-how-the-us-china-trade-war-hurt-america/) , it cost the USA 1.7 trillion at the time of the article and a little over 1% gdp. They might be making a bit at the border taking in tarrifs, but they're hurting more on the back end. IMO incentivising production to move or stay in USA should have been explored more heavily before discentivicing importing those goods.
Gotcha so big options are not a thing for me
I thought it would dip more, and then I never got in :/
i work in a travel industry, and let me tell you. Bf this covid shit, travel industry was one of the industries that were expected to grow the fastest + largest, mainly bc of small home vacational rentals businesses pouring out.. thanks to airbnb.

We are getting a small stimulus within 2 weeks. The stock market requires it and our government works for the stock market.
If I focus hard enough I can make SPY go up nickel

The expectation of them beating earnings is already priced in by most analyst and investors also  “any” and I mean any “good news” is going to make shorts cover due to fear. All GameStop has to do is be above below average.

Well I have 100 shares and a $16p so...
Lol. Yes.
Sure I’ll show you my parents tax bill if you show me your mortgage statement. You’re the one that brought up comparing mortgage statements and now you’ve got cold feet? Sounds like the typical “I don’t have” type of personality. Also, trying to repeatedly talk about my parents’ taxes shows how extremely jealous you are of how I had a good upbringing while you likely had to worry about getting shot while you sleep(reference to living in the ghetto).
I’m buying GME puts at open. F the IV crush, it’s going down. I’M YELLING TIMBER!
Yea Airbnb is going to fuck themselves into the Stone Age between bullshit fees and thumbing their noses at legislators in big cities. The city I live in, my parents tiny little beach town and every other city worth visiting has community groups that actively campaign against Airbnb.  But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a ton of money to be made off of them.
tl;dr. calls on absolutely everything.
There is no such thing as free money. For every winner on the stock market, theres a loser. And right now the losers are everyone not in the market
So you would “add” 10k in income from your gains then it would wash out from your contribution right?
Did u end up holding? If u did ur gonna make mad money on Monday
Don’t worry about it.
If I made 250k, I wouldn’t change a fucking thing in my life. It’s all just a game with green and red lines anyway right? You can cash out in this game?
sorry for your loss 😂😂😂
Don't underestimate the value of the convenience of going to a store vs working with a dealer, for most people.
Yes
I’m a fan of both of those too.
Being boring is a mental illness.
Nothing, but the people buying the dip will more likely have diamond hands, giving the squeeze a better chance.

I’d use the sand wedge here, not the driver. Make a brief, small play and try to catch a December tax loss harvesting selloff. Promise yourself you’ll get away from this idea if this play fails. 

Otherwise, you’ll get well into 2021, hoping a crash allows you to get back to break even, so you can exit this shit. Then the crash will happen and you’ll be like “fuck yeah this is the BIG ONE I KNEW WAS COMING.” So you’ll hold, hoping for monumental gainz. The dip will be bought, and you’ll be right back to fucked, but far more depressed that you got greedy. Then you’ll sell on the next minor dip for a 70% loss on this trade.
Nothing will stop it

-Sell the news.
-The fact that GameStop is a joke of a company and is incredibly outdated. You ever been in one? Smells like cheese
with about 2k id buy 100 pltr and sell a dec 31 call for 30, make 5%, or if it gets called away make 31%, then repeat. I'm not sure how i feel about selling puts here though, too easy to miss out on appreciation.
this thread is spam lmao

When did you purchase them and how did you catch the entry just day two prior to it took off? Yes I know it was over sold but what indication gave you the that big rally..? EMA cross over?
I don't, that's certain, but the only examples of what I'm looking for, that I've seen, cost a fucking TON+/
The only way we get a stimulus is from Mitch's cold dead hands, he likely won't even pass his own stimulus deal. That one is just for looks, watch dems agree to 500b and he puts a 1b on the table.

It's much harder for the gay bear parade to sucker punch a company with 500b mkt cap as opposed to one that is a 40b cap.
Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. You would pay tax as if the 10k was standard pay in the first example.

Venture capitalist Nick Hanauer, Politico Magazine 2014:

“What everyone wants to believe is that when things reach a tipping point and go from being merely crappy for the masses to dangerous and socially destabilizing, that we’re somehow going to know about that shift ahead of time. Any student of history knows that’s not the way it happens. Revolutions, like bankruptcies, come gradually, and then suddenly. One day, somebody sets himself on fire, then thousands of people are in the streets, and before you know it, the country is burning. And then there’s no time for us to get to the airport and jump on our Gulfstream Vs and fly to New Zealand. That’s the way it always happens. If inequality keeps rising as it has been, eventually it will happen. We will not be able to predict when, and it will be terrible—for everybody. But especially for us.”

Need a stronger virus to keep the public scared and submissive or this powder keg might blow.

I tell people buying an option is like renting a stock with an option to buy. You pay the owner some amount of money and he lets you hold the stock for a period of time (expiration).  If the stock goes past the agreed price (strike), you can sell the option and keep the extra money. So your profit is current price - strike price - option price that you paid the owner. If you wait until expiration and you like the stock, you can buy it at the agreed strike price.
so the fda taking the device of the market is not hurting the company?-especially when a shitton of their revenue comes from products related to the jet 7?
I can’t find the exact article that compared it directly but you can see the two numbers:

https://thinkrealty.com/airbnb-bouncing-back-ipo/

For hotels through August: “Since mid-February hotels have lost more than $46 billion, occupancy rates are at less than 35%, and 70% of hotel employees have been laid off or furloughed.”

https://wtop.com/business-finance/2020/12/airbnb-hopes-to-raise-2-6b-in-mid-december-ipo/

For Airbnb: “The number of nights and experiences booked, which plummeted more than 100% in March and April, were down 28% in July, August and September.”


So by these numbers hotels were down 65% in occupancy in August and got rid of 70% of employees

Airbnb was down only 28% going back to June and as widely reported got rid of 25% of employees

They’re doing a LOT better

You didn't read.

"Yes 4Q20, which comes in March, not 3Q20 which comes on Tuesday."

Dumbass.
Yup. I started Taking profit on my long positions and bought some puts on Friday.
I like it, but given that the market is up HUGE all over this year I could see the crash waiting until after Jan 1st for tax purposes.
That’s why I bought LEAPS. While I don’t think a pullback is coming, I also believe that it will peak next summer. I just want to be in early so I maximize returns.
Citron is trying this again? Burry is too so this is going to be interesting to see if this works for him.

I want to cop some LEAPS on something, but I have to admit I am a gay bear on the Airbnb IPO, fuck that dogshit company.
Think we'll get to 10k deaths per day in January?
You pay me money, so that for a limited amount of time, you can, but don't have to, buy or sell 100 shares of a company at a different price than the current price.

If the current price is $110, and you have a call option that lets you buy at $100, you can buy 100 shares at $100 but immediately sell them for $110. Instant profit.

Check out the videos linked at the bottom Adam can explain it much better than I can.

You’re not sufficiently leveraged then my friend
Not a 100% sure but I think your brokerage firm covers it? And then the originator of the contract owes money to the brokerage firm.
Probably true, I never jerked off as much as when I was holding PLTR shares, what a wild ride
🚨 Question(s) for Tax nerds 🚨

If you have say, $10k realized short term gains EOY, and you’re a loser fuck with no other income, would the standard deduction apply to that and you’d pay basically 0 in tax? 

Also, same scenario, but you aren’t a loser fuck, and you *do* have other income, if you contribute $10k before the year ends to a tax deferred account, would that offset the 10k in realized gains?
Thanks. I’ll just let it get called away. Been bag holding PFE for 3 months. Average cost 38. Worst investment I have made this year. Thought it was going to moon on vaccine news.

Same OP. I went all in at 50 shares of Tesla when they were $178 ish each. Been holding ever since then, but I'm curious how much that would/could be now had I done options/calls. What would a successful call have looked like? I'm dumb, so if I could get an eli5 that would be great.

You seem overly optimistic about a vaccine, and it will likely cost you a lot of money, friend.

- December tax loss selloff coming  
- 2k deaths per day, 1 mil cases per day and Christmas/New Year holidays not even hit yet. The new administration wont sit around like the old one did.  
- vaccine does not cover all strains of COVID. The Balrimore Ravens found 4 different strains within their own team at once.

I don't follow the stock but from a look at the charts... it's been on a couple $8 runs within the last year that happened in periods shorter than a month. Everything I can see is pointing toward it currently in the midst of a run.

Personally, I'd take the $1k gamble. OP, that looks like a fking bargain for being so possible. What made you dig through intel options prices?
stimulus? everything with a fat emphasis on airlines assuming they're included in the package

vaccine? recovery and travel stocks go up and if stimulus doesn't pass then possibly a tech dip too  (i hope)

Employment status is distinctly *not* a requirement as it is not uncommon to be unemployed and have earned income. Any earned income at any time can be contributed despite being unemployed. The statement, “not if you are unemployed” is wrong and you even know it.
Okay but if your making it out for a year later there must be a decent chance it will hit or go over??
Yes, let’s commit securities fraud openly on internet forum
Lot of fucking questions here...

Debit spread =you pay to open

Credit spread=you are paid to open

Max profit on debit spread is difference between the strikes minus the capital needed to open the position. If its a $1 difference between strikes and you pay $.5($5) to open, max profit is $95 minus commissions and fees.

Max profit is reached when the underlining is trading above the sold strike price.

Deep ITM option spreads do make money just not much. Buying a $580 Tesla call and selling the next strike, $582.5 will cost $1.47($147) with a max profit of $1.03($103) where as a $625/$630 spread costs $1.40(140$) and a max profit of $360.

Yeah we’ve had so many good IPOs this year that I don’t know why this dude is so cranky. Airbnb already indicated high demand for their IPO. Call fidelity and ask them how oversubscribed it is. They’ve told a few people here they’d have trouble getting shares.

I actually don't know if it's a FINRA regulation or just an internal insider trading compliance thing. I work as an engineer for huge trading applications and get details on thousands of trades per day so everything I do has to be pre cleared.

Also, anything that I do trade I have to hold for a minimum of 30 days. I've found that the best way for me to lock in profits on something that I want to sell is to just sell ITM covered calls :)

What am I supposed to do with 250k?

Like the democrats matter in the senate lmao.
This is definitely the positive scenario. The more reasonable scenario is probably 100 million people vaccinated. Which not enough to open up. So have to wait till the summer (Q3) to open up at the very first

Yeah the other dude didn’t read the details. They ramped up Google Ads in 2019 and found they didn’t help that much so they cut them in 2020 to save money since travel was slowed anyway. When their business bounced back much quicker than expected, they realized the Google marketing spending was largely a waste and decided not to pay for it going forward

They gained market share on hotels this year so all signs indicate its working well.
Consider yourself lucky is the catch, congrats.
That is an absolutely fair take. You could very well be right. I think the Republicans will win both run off races, but obviously it is going to be so so close. It is probably true that the markets are brushing off this possibility way too much. As if a little more stimulus would be worth 35% corporate tax rates, higher investment taxes, etc. the additional gov spending would in no way compensate for all of the economic headwinds that they would pass into law.

It's legit, confirmed publicly by the DoD, CIA, military veterans, and members of congress that oversaw our defense budgets from both sides of the aisle. It's pretty crazy that they've been releasing a steady stream of information on this since, I believe, December 2017 and most people are just yawning. I guess now that it's not a conspiracy anymore it's not as exciting?

where you got that
cohen takeover / good q4 results. this earnings supposed to be meh but could possibly trigger cohen takeover without good forward guidance. hopefully they mention how the consoles have been selling on the call. i cant imagine the price has risen so much this past month solely because people expect good q3 results - that would be retarded. i think people are getting in solely for next quarter, so i don't personally expect much of a sell off.

2. You want both to expire ITM to get max profit. 
3. Yes. Max profit is the difference in strikes - debit.
4. Idk but it’s the only way I could afford Tesla calls so that’s what I did. Of course the one time I do it I buy $500/510 and it rockets to 600.

Not a good idea for a number of reasons. 3x leveraged ETF’s are designed primarily for day trading/swing trading. If you want to mess with options, best to stick to a non leveraged etf. In addition, puts generally yield a higher return than calls. So even if you were right, and didn’t get IV crushed or burned by theta, it would be a smarter idea to buy puts on the 3x ETF rather than calls on the inverse. Between QQQ, TQQQ, and SQQQ, the smartest play would be to buy puts on QQQ. You shouldn’t really mess with options on the 3x ETFs
Awesome!

If you are seriously considering doing options, there are more ways you can leverage yourself. Buy an ITM options, use longer expiry (more time to be right), and such.

You seem overly skeptical of vaccines, until you get over that it will likely end up costing you a lot of money, friend.
Is FAP taken?
nah just the thought of coffee does it for me
This is smart
there might be a dump after earnings which is a great time to put more money in. everyone buying options rn is going to get IV crushed. even if the short squeeze doesn't happen, the general consensus is that the stock is undervalued. but there's always risk involved
Are we pretty much playing GME on the hopes of the console sales?

Pfizer already fucked up its distribution.

Wait until they realize how much distributing a vaccine alongside Christmas gifts get when UPS has already told retailers to go fuck themselves.
Fuel for the uneducated to feed their conspiracy theories, so that they don't focus on reality.

If you're going to buy into that you might as well go out and buy a bigfoot T-shirt and baseball cap tomorrow.
If the earnings call is poor I can see the price come down a few dollars but there is a lot of great support at the $12 range from what I understand. It will slowly creep back up as others get excited for the Q4 earnings. 

If you've got shares I wouldn't worry too much

Yeah I meant Congress senate and executive my bad... but if they get the senate and expand the Supreme Court there is a fair argument to be made that they would in fact have all 3 branches.
I just discovered WSB like a week ago, I don't take it seriously. You know how DAT hindsight 20/20 works though when you think about how much more $ you'd have if you'd made every trade perfectly.
Missed your post but good timing. Tuesday auction should be very interesting. Considering bolstering OTM positions in ER!C. QC0M already made my account back.
Basically the idea of reversion to the mean is that stocks tend to return to a price that they were previously at after events. For instance let's say a clinical trial went badly, so the stock dumps 40%, it will, over time, likely regain some of that (I always say half) so 20% would be my price target. The same is true with bumps; the cannabis stocks are doing that now, go up a lot, drift down; price target is about 20% so you would buy puts to that and move on.
Expect -30% downside risk at worst imo

The last 8 quarters have been earning disasters. Q3 is not supposed to be good, but guidance is the play
I personally believe we are seeing one of the biggest pump and dumps of all time. Apart from my index fund and a few positions in growth industries I'm going short on everything else so if the market tanks overall I'm not screwed.
Imagine the life with Covid around and no stock market. Most of us will go real mad.

Don't be attached to the shares. You profit either way with an extra premium from the call itself. Then you switch to the cash secured puts to potentially get the shares back at a lower price if you so choose if its a rather volatile stock. Or just buy back in at the new PT if you feel it has too much support at the higher price. Stocks could also always go to 0 even if you like the prospects of the company. Anythibg is possible this is just conservative money making without YOLOing everything on a SPAC

There is a scientific proof that states the pain when you lose is greater than the high when you win.  That's why you remember losses more than wins, and this affects your behavior negatively.
Get out of here with those reasonable takes.  I don’t think your attainable goals of that type of mixed economy (minor tweaks to the current US economy) are far fetched.  Private property rightS are a must and will continue to be protected. The safety net talk,  seems like a big part of the current problem is the failure for the government spending to adequately or actually maximize many of the current “safety-nets” programs.  Actual education investment that provides better employment prospects (at CC/trade schools/universities), rather than a lot of wasted investment.  Can’t even pretend to know a lot about health care, outside of the ACA providing me 2 years of coverage as I found my career.  Failed programs are just a productivity suck and too much political capital tied to them.  

Capitalism or more free-market economics is always going to produce more innovation than a centrally planned economy.  The centrally planned economy under the right leadership is going to be more efficient. I completely agree about Rand and the ignoring of many of other lessons (value for value, skin in the game); but do love the hero entrepreneur mentality.  It seems like with basic needs covered responsibly (healthcare) then we would have increased in entrepreneurship and thus more US based innovations.  For me it seems like the economic populism coming from the left is marginally better suited/ more likely to get some programs in place and boost innovation.  On the right I see a lot of accusations of socialism and economic populist talk, but no real action towards facilitating new entrepreneurs.  Could just also be due to last four years being team red in charge and I forgot team blue doesn’t actually move the needle much (if at all) when they are in charge.

Appreciate the good faith comments

Vaccine DD:

Moderna can do 125 million doses in first quarter so 62 million people can be vaccinated 

Pfizer: 50 million in December = 25 million people
1.3 billion in 2021. Let's say production gradually rises next year so first three months is: 60 million in january, 70 million in feb, 80 million in march = 210 million doses = 105 million people vaccinated

Total vaccinated people at the end of Q1 is around 192 million, although probably lower because might take a few weeks before a produced vaccine is inserted

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/pfizer-shares-fall-on-report-company-cut-its-covid-vaccine-rollout-target.html

https://time.com/5917847/pfizer-cut-covid-19-vaccine-targets/

"Moderna Inc., which has also submitted a messenger RNA-based vaccine to the FDA for emergency clearance, said in a statement on Thursday it would have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first quarter of 2021."

Pfizer: "“Finished doses are being made at a rapid pace,” said Rose. “We are confident in our ability to supply 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.”"

Right, the municipal restrictions are what people keep trumpeting, but remember the same thing about Uber 7-8 years ago? They ended up making It work. Unlike Uber, Airbnb is already in 220 countries. They can absolutely afford to lose some revenue in some cities and continue to grow in others because they are everywhere already though nascent in many markets. Long-term viability will not be decided by a few cities or countries rental/lodging codes. Many titans have geographic areas they can’t break through or into. Walmart has consistently struggled abroad. Target too. Firearm manufacturers face restrictions in many countries, etc.  Those companies, if well-run, either adapt, lobby, or focus their energies in more profitable areas. 

Actual concerns about long-term profitability:
1. Global economic recovery - it already is incredibly uneven. The broader the recovery in the US industries, the better. Printing tendies in joke valuations in us markets doesn’t help many people travel. The US is lucky to be able to brrrr most countries cannot. This will hurt discretionary spending. This hurts airbnb. 

2. International conflict. Historically follows economic downturns as scarcity forces aggression for limited resources. Any of this hurts air bnb in affected regions. 

3. Covid recovery. Much like the economy, vaccine rollout will be uneven and favor developed nations with functional health care systems and an educated populace. Lack of access to or refusal to take vaccine will slow travel recovery in these areas. US could well be one of these with its 6th grade educated populace. Any lengthening of Covid era hurts Airbnb. 

4. Moats are lower than other household names and poachers know how to doppelgäng good ideas. China will undoubtedly copy the concept with its own state-backed or culturally embraced company. That’s a big market to lose significant share in. Last I remember reading Uber was still doing OK in the country with a similar story in India, but not the level of market dominance you want to become Amazon level ubiquity and global dominance. 

Those are what I see as true exposure, short and long. That said, I’m still totally hot for the stock’s long-term growth and will be buying over the first 6 months-1 year, even knowing the above concerns because it’s clear Airbnb will overcome them and the inevitability of them either being bought by a Marriott, Booking or vice versa to achieve total market dominance is a foregone conclusion for me. Buy and hold and buy more.
There may be 100s of ways to use it correctly, but you found one that doesn't work. You have also severely overestimated the power of your goading. You caught me, I am too poor for a mortgage. Did you forget you made a play on "slice" in the beginning of the sentence, or did you think it was so clever that you intentionally used it again at the end of the sentence?
Lol you’re sitting here telling everyone this is just like Uber which is at all time highs and worth $97 BILLION

Yes that’s right if people bought the Uber IPO you hate so much they’d have made major profits even before selling covered calls. This is despite a pandemic that shuttered their entire core business. But keep sitting here telling us how Uber IPOed without profits and it was doomed to fail

TLDR you have no idea what you’re talking about and you’re just talking shit and being an asshole 🤡

Fannie on wsb? What is this, 2016?
Yes. For a call, you’d rather buy at the strike price and then sell the shares at the current price (which is above your strike price) for a profit.

For a put, you’d rather sell at the strike price and buy the shares at the current price (which is below your strike price). 

For put, which seems a little more confusing. Think about buying 100 shares at $2/share knowing you have the option to sell them to someone else for $10/share. 

Keep in mind, assuming there is liquidity in the options, you can always sell the option to someone else before expiration so you don’t need to buy or sell the underlying shares. 

As we talked about, the premium should have adjusted to reflect the changes in the underlying stock price. So you should be able to recognize the profit without going through the work of exercising the option and purchasing or selling the underlying shares.

Fuck the tax man im cashin out and buying kush

Eh I'm long INTC and even I think that's a bit optimistic. It tends to run up before earnings just like anything else these days because everyone is always expecting good news. But for a low volatitly stock like this to run 8 dollars in a month is too much. Sell while you're ahead.
If you're a bear maybe

Gamestop short squeeze before the end of the year?
What you’re basically going to do is put your foot down and say “right now the economy ends” do you really feel you’ve done enough research to accurately Time the peak? If not then wait for real news to act on and see if investor sentiment shifts. In the long term you may be right but in the short term buyer sentiment will remain the same and for the most part the market will move upwards, making your position cheaper. So why not wait to time it and buy lower
And have a very merry Christmas!!!!
If you bought FB at the ipo you only had to hold for like a year to start making good returns and making bank after like 2 years. This *is* a short term investment pretty anywhere but this sub.

How much bragging is too much bragging?
yes but it doesnt work blindly. you need to understand option chains a little and be able to have a educated 'guess' if options are actually being bought vs used as a hedge, part of a spread and being sold etc. 

ive developed a working strategy and i have like a 95% success rate so far. but its a bull market so even blind moneys are geniuses.

ill wait till a bearish downturn to see if i can keep this up
Yeah, he does

I agree business travel will never return to pre pandemic levels. Travel relies on two things: fear/willingness and ability to pay/travel. There is a willingness but less means to travel in 2021. Airbnb supply is/was largely people renting their place while traveling for business or a second/third residence. What happens when foreclosures go through the roof? Reduced supply. Who gets government bailout money? Big business (hoteliers), not individual landlords/Airbnb owners. I suppose we’ll have to agree to disagree here. I get your point but there are too many headwinds and ways for their business to unwind for me.
It’s gonna be yuge
gooba gobba one of us we accept him one of us
Disclaimer: I just stated i don’t know a thing about options. And I’ve never really made it that far. I sell the contract before it expires and have never executed one. But....

The contract is the right to buy a given amount of shares at the strike price by a certain date. Exercising the option will buy those shares at the strike price and you will be sitting on the shares you bought the contracts for and minus the money to buy them. But will be sitting on potential gains as you can now sell those shares for the market value, which should be atleast high enough above the strike price you bought to break even. That price target should probably be figured out before buying the options, but yolo.
Just a reminder that the year is almost over retards.

And the tax-man wants his cut.
Poor boi here hasn't experienced the buy the rumor sell the news phenomenon. God speed
God speed fellow retard 🚀
Ditto lol I'm not rich enough to stay liquid as long as this market has been irrational
Of course I did. I panic sold at the very very bottom after holding strong for a few days. Then I made it all back and then some on Apple and MSFT options
Actually Steam is the Amazon
Am 🌈🐻 v. Snowflake.  

At the minimum hoping for a pullback with the first insider expiry date coming up.
So, essentially most people are gonna pump thousands into shares premarket and then dump them as the price rockets and then there are gonna be 1000s of bagholders that weren't in on the scheme at the bottom of the drop.

The bear thesis is done. Large cap companies do just fine in this sort of environment. Retail investors who think the economy moves based upon the demand side rather than supply side are so smooth brained it hurts. The only real catalyst to the down side is if the Dems win the Georgie senate run offs in January which would give them all 3 branches of Gov. Or perhaps if COVID somehow mutates and starts killing 5% of infected people with a more normal distribution of ages not just the elderly. Other than that pls explain what the downside catalysts are.
Cashed out during the pump Friday. Will buy back in to 12/18 calls if it trades down or flat.

Still have Mexico legislation news by 15th.

My guess before the vote is while we wouldn’t see a huge pump we’d probably see higher floors. We will see if that plays out.
Now move your mouth up and down
> MOST brokerages will usually exercise your contract, or sell it. If you don't have enough capital to buy the 100 shares, they will exercise the contract and then liquidate the shares, giving you the profit between the strike price and current price. To avoid that, it is usually advisable to sell your contract before expiration.
market is jacket to its non-gendered tits
Agreed
Yes just like Uber which is at all time highs after a decade of “wise” investors like you saying it’s over. LOL

They even survived a pandemic which is much worse for them than Airbnb which actually gained market share vs hotels

You’re clearly not familiar with venture capital investing. The whole point is to pump in billions of dollars to grow quickly and create network effects which make it extremely difficult for anyone to compete (and then you buy the best competition)

None of these companies are trying to show a profit. As they come public they start to appease the public investors but yes obviously they could have been cash flow positive for years if they wanted a slower growth rate.
Those days don’t mean shit anymore
Dalwhinnie
The right play seems to be buying shares and selling weekly covered calls to wsb at inflated premiums once this starts to pump.
I learned not to bet against the market. Too difficult to time. If you do want to, just dump a couple hundred in it. That way when you’re wrong like 5x in a row, you’ll only lose $1000. Then when you’re right that one time you can maybe make the $1000 back. 

TLDR: Stonks go up
i know i've been here lol

it's just fun to fuck around on the other side of the table sometimes

Pfizer: "“Finished doses are being made at a rapid pace,” said Rose. “We are confident in our ability to supply 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.”"

If it's true that the Pfizer vaccine can start being distributed in 2 weeks after approval from the FDA this week, we are going to green like we've never greened before.

What's the plays boys?
If you’re in margin yes that’s an option. Or move the shares to a cash account.
The price of a contract is made up of INTRINSIC value (Stock price - Strike price) + EXTRINSIC value (premium - intrinsic value). EXTRINSIC value is affected by time decay and implied volatility.  If a stock price is OUT OF THE MONEY, it will have 0 intrinsic value and only priced according to its EXTRINSIC value. Once the contract gets IN THE MONEY, then you can start factoring its INTRINSIC value.

I will use that 1,000,000 dollar TSLA option post as an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7anqp/200000\_return\_4\_presplit\_tsla\_options\_purchased/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7anqp/200000_return_4_presplit_tsla_options_purchased/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

In that post, it appears he bought 20x 136c expiring on 1/15/21 for 0.23 X 100 each. He paid 460 dollars for those contracts that were comprised of only EXTRINSIC value. As soon as the price of TSLA got above his strike price, his contracts were now worth the INTRINSIC + EXTRINSIC values.

If we calculate the INTRINSIC value of his contract, it is 598.98 -136 = 462.98 (Stock price - Strike Price). The EXTRINSIC value is 463.35 - 462.98 = 0.37, but is extremely small in comparison to his INTRINSIC value. If we calculate the total premium for the contract, it is 462.98 + 0.37 = 463.35 X 100 shares/contract = $46,335. Since he owns 20 contracts, his total equity is 46,335 X 20 = $926,700.

Essentially, he bought 20 far far OUT OF THE MONEY contracts for cheap and once the stock price hit the strike price, he started getting $2,000 for every dollar that TSLA went up. This is the power of options.
Too basic
Blue Horseshoe like Gamestop

How often do you see a huge surge after IPO and a then a giant drop to below the original price? I feel like I see that kinda often in charts. Makes me wonder why everyone is cock throbbing to get in abnb immediately.

No, Yes
Flu vaccine is the way it is because it's made as cheaply as possible so that we can literally give it away to anyone who wants it every year. The process for making the vaccines that are currently being produced is significantly more expensive but more reliable, and the techniques being used to design the vaccine are cutting edge and fundamentally more effective and safer than that used in a flu vaccine. Breakthroughs in the science that were just discovered and shouldn't have hit the market for another decade just due to cost of implementation have been pushed into current industry practices.

I have a chub for biosciences and watching the development of the vaccine has been pornographic for me.

Sweetheart, there’s a 100 ways to slice up the humble pie reference and humble pie is something people have been referencing to for over a millennium, so you might say there is no wrong way to slice up that pie.       

Why not just post it on here? Cause you’re too poor for a mortgage?
Will CRSR go back up to $50?

Will BABA go back up to $280?
Yes because this sub is all about long term investing. This will probably be a bit like Facebook, short term a bad idea.

Lmao.

There's a difference between that and taking a jam packed airplane to visit parents that never liked you.

I always buy these $20 calls just because it's only $20 and why not but I've bought like 40 of them this year so that's retarded
I’m surprised more people don’t talk about TSLA here
Enough to buy PLTR 12/11 $50 calls right?  Asking for a friend.

So how’d this work out?
PLTR calls
Yeah quoting Q1 numbers when we are most of the way through Q4 but not their profitable Q3 number as the lockdowns eased is really the way to do fair due diligence. Not to mention that Q3 and Q4 are good every year...

Here is the title of the WSJ article which gives the exact opposite impression that you tried to give: **“Airbnb IPO Filing Shows Profitable Quarter After Deep Cuts”**
Are u saying fuck TA because that’s how I feel and if this lets me beat crayon gang I gotta check it out. Right now I trade by gut feel alone and doing pretty decent but not phenomenal
I appreciate it but the last thing I want is to drag this all out. The case would just be a he said she said thing. I already told her that she made me feel pressured and unadded her on everything. Hoping I can just move on
Yea I’m definitely going to invest in a Roth, some Mutuals, etc. just some basic shit to start building towards some minimal passive income. In the next few years tho I just wanted to play around with some stocks and get my feet wet, nothing crazy. A few thousand up or down a year for my first few years would be fine, just for the fun of it.
You're a special kind of retard.

Perfect for my 360p 12/31
These aren't as risky. I do something similar to OP, I just don't hold quite as long. I bought $35 2022 XOM calls back when the stock was ~$32 then sold them when they went in the money and bought $40 XOM calls. Just sold those this last Friday and bought $42.5 calls. All of the profits go into stocks that I sell covered calls against and I keep the same or close to the same buying power in options.
Too peaty imo
Wait for the ABNB dip. Yolo it all. Collect tendies

Yes and buy some calls! Arc is crushing it

Options are an excellent way to lose your money quickly, because they retain little to no value of the stock that underlies them moves the wrong way, or not at all.

But if they move the right direct real fast, you rich af. This only happens if you're smart. You, being a member of r/wallstreetbets, are immediately disqualified from this outcome.

Not even close. This is a long play.
Low IV and the relative percentage gains that accompany it change depending on the ticker. Some tickers go through daily movements of 1-2% stock value while others routinely swing 5-10%. This causes the general stock option IV to be higher or lower but pretty much staying consistent so IV crush isn’t really a thing unless you’re buying short-dated options right before a publicly announced date catalyst like an earnings call. But know that IV over say 200% needs much more than a 1% stock movement in your preferred direction to see profitable gains.
CRM. That is all.

He's guaranteed to veto any stimmy bill. He'll use it to pretend that he's against big government spending during his 2024 campaign.

So XOM went from $30-$40 and you only made $2 or 115%? Why would you even brag about your position if you don’t have the balls for weeklies? You’re trying to tell us to pick up positions and trust your Dd after a 33% run up in which you failed to pull in the 100-3000% returns XOM and BP have been getting to compound daily.
So isn’t it correct that the more ITM the option is the more it is effected by Vega? You say you buy OTM, so doesn’t this reduce your Vega price swing?

Yep. This isn't Uber, which had to deal with taxi companies all over the place. If it's between people defaulting on their mortgages or putting hotels out of business, the government isn't gonna regulate shit.

50c 12/18 🤣
Would need volume in premarket that they wouldn’t have, I think.
Ehhhh I don’t know. It started out as something for people to do for extra income,  now you basically have companies pretending to be people renting out their vacation homes.

This strategy is about IV gain, not earnings in particular.  That is a different method.
If this is calls you’re talking about, 500@0.55 is $27,500. If the cost basis goes up 0.45, you make $22,500 in profit. Basically, you would make $500 for each “cent” the options moves.

If this is shares, then yeah, you make 45 cents per shares.

Lol did you buy PLTR on IPO day? I did and one the dip I doubled my position, I'm up over 100% now. 

I'm approaching AirBnB the same, put 5k in on IPO day, and double then triple if it goes down significantly. 

But too many positive catalysts with the recovery to risk not getting in on this one imo.
RDSA slashed their dividend for the first time in history. They may not be able to pump back up to the mid-50s by next summer. Too much of a gamble, not enough meme potential.

Airbnb does not rely on business travelers they go after backpack travelers, families and younger travelers. Long term stays. Business travelers are a new opportunity for them. Hotels are pretty much fucked I manage hotels for a living. Business travel won’t return for a while to pre covid travel now that companies found out they can survive without it they will just save those expenses. People will be hesitant to stay at hotels so they will opt out for Airbnb.

The demand for travel next year will be through the roof next year and hotels will charge premiums to make up money from this year tons of hotels will also be out of business
The high was in the $60s, but many more shares were in circulation at that time. If it hit the same market cap that it reached at the previous high then it would be over $100 since there are less shares now.
How we feel about tomorrow retards? Red or green ?
I think the best advice I ever got was to look at /r/wallstreetbets as entertainment but never take advice or any post seriously. You should really do the same because multiplying your money by 6 times and thinking that's pathetic is incredibly dangerous to your financial health.
Gme had its peak at 60 back in 2013, correct, but since then the available float has been but in half. This means the old price is only half what the new price would be if it happened today. So 100 is reasonable if we hit 2013 levels
Macallan and Fidfich are go tos and am looking to branch out a bit. Thank you!
I know. Just so mad i found this play on my own and researched it and did dd and love everything about it, then sold to free up cash. Check it friday afternoon and felt physically sick
>No, it hasn't. In fact, the highest GME has ever hit was $62.30, on Dec 28, 2007. 

 Back in 2007 when it hit $62.30, there were 168 million shares outstanding. Through buybacks over the years, there are now just 65 million shares outstanding. The equivalent price today would be $161

Well you just bolded random passages about Q1 and Q2 when they’ve already reported Q3 results. Are you really quoting that a travel company laid off staff at the beginning of the pandemic as a bad thing? Every single company did it. Disney is largely shut down, has fired tens of thousands of workers, and is at all time highs. Even Apple took long term loans in the spring. All it did was help their margins so you should be happy.

So yes feel free to highlight that in March they weren’t sure how October and November would go just to be a jerk. We now know they went super well and a major analyst is already saying it’s worth $75+

Not everyone agrees with me, but I think the likelihood of a short capitulation from this ER event itself is slim, and I don’t see a wave of buying breaking them just yet. Hence my bias to be short vol and expect an attack + short window buying opportunity.

If you buy a call from me, we agree on

- a strike price

This is that pre-set price. At any point during our temporary contract you can buy 100 shares of XYZ from me for this price. If the actual price goes above this price, you can immediately buy those 100 shares from me and sell them for immediate profit. But if it doesn't go above the price or if it goes down, you don't have to.

- an expiration day

This is when our contract ends. After this day, the contract is over. I no longer have to sell you my shares.

- a premium

This is what you pay me at the beginning to buy the call.

So when writing it out, you'll see it listed as XYZc $100 12/21

XYZ is the company, the little c means its a call, if you see a little p it means put. $100 is the strike price, and 12/21 is the expiration.
Yeah it’s weird. They’re not black and don’t rap about shooting people
I could only imagine in this sub 😭
You lucky bastard
💎🙌 or 😨🤳 (panic sell):

1000 contracts of SPY 12/11 $380c

20 contracts of TSLA 12/24 $600c

50 contracts of GLD 6/18 $170c
This is the way
This is going up past $300 by the first half of next year for sure.

I have some calls right now but I was legitimately upset that BABA did not fall (it fucking rose instead!) after the House passed the China delisting bill. Was prepared to buy another round of LEAPS calls if BABA had fallen to $250 and below.

I hope Trump's signing of the anti-China bill tanks BABA's stock price so I can load up on much better prices.

Every legal scholar agrees the court will rule against the gov.

The gov (Secretary) has ability to make a deal and avoid court case. If that was going to happen it would happen right before oral arguments (Wed). Allows gov to save face.

I want you to think hard about what is happening to you in that infographic. You have been given faces and accomplishments however you have not been given *options*. You have no idea what applicants actually showed up nor do you have any idea if these people are actually best for the job; you only have their accomplishments (which of course are stylized to attract you, dear investor) and the implication that this team is a great team.

In reality I propose that the picture afore you may not be the reality you think it is; I don't propose that we overdiversify but I doubt that these individuals are the cream of the crop, no biases were in place in hiring, and that there wasn't some kind of inclination for presentation here. There is tons of material on this but basically again it is fine that you do not know anything about this, that's good, just stop pretending you do or understand the issues here.

You don't. 

I think this is the problem of expertise. You can tell right away when someone is flat out clueless but I don't think you think you're clueless. I think you think your points are valid because you don't know any better.

If you've read the countless serious DDs on this, you would know that there hasn't really a fair enough comparison in the history of short squeezes. Read the 3+ main DDs from the foremost WSB researchers on this, and they give out PTs. But even then, were not really sure. If we knew how to predict the future, this sub wouldn't exist and we'd all have our own hedge funds.
Also note that the squeeze, atleast from what I've read here as well, should take days to happen, due to the amount of shorts that need to cover relative to the average daily volume (see: short days to cover).
Go through the sub and search GME, and read everything you can on it. At the end of the day, no one here is responsible for your gains and/or losses, and DDs are only as useful as you make em.

No, you just want to draw a face on it in MS Paint and I'm not okay with that.
They hate us cuz they anus.
I want to answer since you asked without artifice but I'm not worldly enough to speak knowledgeably. 

Instead I'll answer what my ideal (attainable) capitalist society would look like.

The means of production are privately owned with strong private property protection. Social safety nets exist but they're engineered to help you help yourself. I'd like to see job training and community college to be replaced with welfare. I'm far from smart enough to talk about health care reform but anything like Sanders' plan to outlaw private insurance is a non-starter for me. I'd like to see what Biden does with the public option. 

Unattainable capitalist goal? I love Ayn Rand and believe she's right about rational self interest and trading value for value. Unfortunately too many people read Atlas Shrugged and come away with greed instead of selfishness and cheating instead of trading value for value.

> Options are contracts that allow but don't require the buyer to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a pre-set price.

And that's where I am lost, never to be found.
Meh it doesn't need to move much
Originally it was an insurance method. If I wanted to buy 100 shares but wanted to be sure about the profit I could buy an option and only buy the 100 shares if the price goes up. There is a good chance It won't go up, and I'll lose my premium. But if it goes up, ill make a bunch of money. High risk I'll lose, but if I win, I'll win big.

To the person selling it, its great, you can make extra money by selling options against your shares.

The benefits are magnified effects of risk and reward.

The seller gets to greatly increase his chance of profit, while the buyer gets to greatly increase his potential profit.

There **are** areas where your losses are infinite, but not a standard call/put on Robinhood. What you pay is your max loss, and they charge you an exact amount.

This is very true. There are some you aren’t even allowed to name like one My Very Intelligent Sister recommended that I’ve tripled my money on just holding it.
CSPs lower your capital investment on a stock; this is a great way to extend your dollar (albeit there is risk).  If I want XYZ stock and it's @ $110/share, I can write a CSP @ $100 for $200 premium and if XYZ drops down to $100, I then buy 100 shares @ $100 ($1000 total), but I've collected $200 in premium so my cost/share is really $80 (($1000 total - $200 premium)/100 shares).  So as long as XYZ doesn't drop below $80 (this is the risk part), you're "making money" since you could then re-sell the position at more than you paid for it.

Edit: yeah I fucked up the math; underlying concept remains solid
You’d be up 15x if you held Facebook

These mega IPOs are almost always a good hold. Airbnb is going into Nasdaq to be another meme stock.

It's only 37% on the portion above $518,400. The overall tax percentage on this would be someting like 30%. Still a ton of fucking money to give those shitbags.

You know what they say, an AAPL a day, the gainz will stay
they lived in a fantasy land where the value of their homes doubled sometimes every couple years, so they took out equity and bought more and more and starting renting to college kids. Now those college kids are getting green lighted to not pay off debt and rent and boomers are shitting themselves.
Yeah you’re clearly retarded. You definitely belong here
Nothing against you. I've noticed so many people on wsb can't do a simple valuation. They always just look at P/E and say "well, I'm done."
Low integrity = high profits
Shares, to write calls
Crude oil is $.84 per gallon. Gold is like $.60 per milligram. It’s a lot easier to deal with the gold.
It’s fine to learn about this stuff, but unless you are sitting on a large pile of cash, it’s just not worth spending that much time on advanced stock plays and trying to outsmart the market. Spend that time focused on earning money and increasing the size of your paycheck. If you want to invest, don’t over think it. Put it in broad coverage ETFs like VTI and QQQ, and leverage the massive tax benefit of maxing out a Roth IRA ($6k annual limit) and it’s a near certainty you will be better off in the long run, and highly likely in the short term as well compared to the fuckwits on this sub (all of whom I love and appreciate dearly).
But I still don't know what a call is

Berry is an idiot, why would Elon sell his shares and tank the stock for some capital? The company is growing nicely.

It's better to let TSLA moon, other people can sell the shares/options and buy a tesla with the gains and Tesla can gain the capital that way.

You don't know what option premium "means"?

And the fact that option value will move with TSLA is why they aren't suitable for "any bank" - buying these calls is a bet on the price movement of an insanely volatile underlying in a bubble, at all time market highs, with a time limit and a depreciating premium component.
So who do I have to sodomize today to get my award ?

Vega is highest for at the money options because that's the price where people are most uncertain about the future price of the underlying.  Think of it this way: a far OTM option will stay OTM even if the IV changes a little bit because regardless, the option is still trash.  Similarly, a far ITM option is not about to become worthless because IV has changed.

Was a little pretentious... but your” not supporting handouts” isn’t really an accurate reflection of anti-socialism sentiments.  If someone “anti-handouts” they should be appalled by the propping up of these corporations with the handouts.  In the last 21 years the airlines have gotten government handouts... Large ISPs have gotten government handouts... 🥭(really Paul Ryan’s) tax cuts were essentially handouts to the top 15% of Americans... All supply side or trickle down economics is just benefits for the corporate and/or upper socio-economic classes.  Yeah to pretend that one handout is capitalism and the other hand out is socialism is silly.

Just when I think it can't go lower...it does
yea me too fuck this shit im so exhausted
If you want to be realistic, the short squeeze isn’t going to really happen. VW and every other squeeze require a lack of liquidity to pull off. 

“We hold 5% of shares, CHEWY boy bough 10% there is not float!!” You say, but the daily volume is still 10% of outstanding shares. So despite all the holders it still gets crazy volume. Enough volume that short sellers could exit positions by the thousands and barely affect daily volume
I think C3.AI is going to be huge after it IPO’s. Surprisingly my favorite IPO this next week
Yes they are higher risk/reward due to the leverage and expiration.

Calls = the right but not the obligation to purchase shares at a specific price on or before a specific date.

Puts = holder has the right to sell at a specific price on or before a specific date.

Buy calls when you are bullish on a company, buy puts when you are bearish on a company.

I won’t get into options strategy because I don’t know shit, but the two that a beginner should understand would be:

Covered Calls
Cash secured Puts
Tesla is also trading at over 60 times revenue. Completely fucking overvalued. Lol
Calls == a bet that the stock will go up and hit a certain price by a certain date

Puts == same but a bet it goes down

The price you pay pay for making this bet is the premium. Once you buy one, you can resell it so it can go up or down in value based on if the bet is more or less likely to happen. Obviously if it's a bet that it's goin up (a call) then if the stock goes up, it goes up in price because it is closer in price to the strike (the price you bet it would hit). Also, as the date gets closer, the value goes down, as the uncertainty and speculation is less as you get closer. 

It's called an option because this bet I speak of, is actually the option to buy or sell 100 shares at the price you choose.

If you buy a put, you'll pay the premium, that is your max loss. The chance you'll profit is probably pretty low, but if you profit you'll profit greatly.

If you sell a put, you get paid the premium, that is your max gain. The chance you'll profit is great, but if you lose, you'll lose a lot
We YOLO’ing this shit boys?
If you want that type of play I'd consider a $20C/$30C debit spread, and then if there's a dip after & IV crush close the $30C leg. Or even use the $35s. I personally don't think the 3Q ER is the squeeze event trigger based on the entirety of what we've observed over the past few months with the large player(s) on the other side.

I'm all in based solely on how trustworthy you look in your Twitter picture. The rest is far too complicated.
I have a bunch of $10 strike because with 75 delta they are the closest stock proxies. When I bought them initially I wanted to sell short term calls against them but that's pointless because PCG option premiums are peanuts. 

Recently I've moved more towards $20 1/23 options. Will also start picking up $25 strike. Because those get more upside as PCG starts going up due to gamma increases.

Dude this same bullshit happened to me. I think comes down to Robinhoods bullshit ass system of “would you like to receive a credit or pay a debit?”
Which is retarded because if i am closing a debit spread, obviously i want a credit. My finger accidentally hit debit though and i ended up getting $0 for my order. I believe it was about $500 i lost. Contacted robinhood. No answer (this was in feb/march mind you).

Yeah that's the problem.
You have to have a call for said company at 12,000 strike price so if you do, you’re in the money if you bought your ticket saying it’ll be 3000 then your out the money, it all matters on what you bought the contract for, it’s betting on the ticker, call go up, put go down, date of expiration matters so what are the odds of you getting to your desired ticker price by said date, if your expiration date is too close and you expect it to jump $100 probably not a good option as it’s unreasonable

It broke me first tho.
The very reason I made this bet is because people like you thought it was impossible. You can only get 100:1 on your money when someone has extreme confidence in something being impossible, so thank you and others like you for extreme misplaced confidence.

Tbh it’s kinda ridiculous that even after this happened you’re arguing that there’s no way this could have happened and you think I’m wrong for literally thinking that what happened was possible. That’s extreme confidence for ya 👌🏼

Anyone sell covered calls on NIO?
Not all! I’m coming back with my $2
Okay so you can think of calls as coupons and puts as insurance.

Calls/coupons and puts/insurance have three things you gotta consider. Strike price, cost of contract (premium), and the expiration date. Each contract represents 100 shares.

Strike price price of call is the $ amount/share the call/coupon will let you buy all 100 shares at. For example, if a call has a strike price of $10, and you have 1, then regardless of what the stock price is at, you get you buy all 100 shares at $10 a pop. 

Okay so before you buy that $10 strike price call, you need to consider how much you are paying for it. If the call says $1.00, it actually costs $100, since the call represents 100 shares. For you to not lose any money (break even) in the example, the actual share price needs to reach $11 ($100 profit - $100 entry cost = no profit or loss). If it hits $12, thats $100 profit, $13 is $200 profit, etc. 

You don't actually need to have enough money to buy the 100 shares. The call/coupon itself will reflect the change in value of the stock. Robinhood sells contracts automatically 1 hour before they expire, as long as the contract is in the money. You can sell contracts anytime you want as well. Just remember that it counts as a day trade if you buy and sell the same contract the same day. You can sell and then buy the same day without it counting.

Next up is expiration date. How far away the contract expires influences how much the contract costs. Consider this.. two contracts with the same strike price but different expiration dates. A contract that expires a year from now is going to cost way more than one that expires next week. This is because the year out contract has much more time to reach the strike price and go up from there. If you weekly contract doesn't reach the strike price, then it expires worthless and you lose all the money you spent on it. 

Weekly contracts are very risky, but can net you a lot of profit, since usually they are very cheap, and if you stock jumps up suddenly, that cheap contract will then not be as cheap. This works best when you buy more than just a few weeklies. Say I buy 50 at $10 each ($500 total) and then goes up whatever amount and the contracts are worth $50 each, then I can sell them all for $2500, netting myself $2000 profit.

Puts are basically like calls except they let you sell 100 shares at the strike price. You don't have to have 100 shares of a stock the buy puts, as what you want to make your money on is the share price of the stock dropping below the strike price, so you can sell the put to someone else.

Options are extremely risky and you will lose all your money. Weeklies even more so.

Bruh why you trying to crush the man? Everyone knows buying a stock posted here makes it tank, let the man keep some dignity, fuck.
If this is a turnaround story then I'm hoping it steadily grows over time. The highest strike on 1/23 leaps is $15 and is going for about $2.25. It has a 50 delta. Which means compared to buying the stock, there's about 2x more upside. These will also be the least affected by IV crush compared to near term options. And practically 0 theta. And as BB gets closer to $15, you get gamma increases too. 

Might pick up these on Monday.

Sell it on 24. Jump back in on new year for earning
No doubt.
Sure
There are a few questions in here I’ll try to answer. 

First, in my example, I referenced a “call option” which is the right to buy shares at a specified price on or before a specified date.

Note that you paid for the right to do this but you are not OBLIGATED to do so.

Second part, if the share price drops after you purchase the option, you simply let the option expire worthless. Meaning you lose the premium you paid and the contract terminates.

Third, the contract doesn’t go negative. It just sits at $0.00 or $0.01 until it expires.

Fourth, the short answer on who sets the premium is “the market.” So people will buy and sell options contracts just like individual shares of a stock and they have bid/ask spreads on them that change every day.

Fifth, to expand on premium pricing. If you want to go down a rabbit hole google “the Greeks” in options trading. Essentially, people set premium based on things like the timeframe the contract will be open, volatility of the underlying stock and some other considerations. 

Sixth, going back up to my initial points. Buying and selling shares only needs to happen if an options contract is exercised. 

By that I mean, in your example where you bought a call option @ $10 and the stock price goes to $2. No shares will (or I guess I should say “SHOULD”) change hands. If you’re the one with the option contract - why would you exercise it and buy 100 shares at $10, costing you $1,000, when you could buy 100 shares for $2 costing you $200? It doesn’t make financial sense.

So a significant amount of options expire each week without ever being exercised.
[removed]
What the actual fuk
Yes but robinhood will automatically sell it before closing that day if you don't have enough money in your account to buy the 100 shares. Otherwise it will automatically buy the 100 shares.

I agree with you 100%. MAC is 100% of my portfolio, and is the most undervalued stock on the market right now. Bought in at $9.4 with slight leverage. Their Covid-affected FFO is $2.08, apply a 10x multiple on that and your target price is $20.8. If you use 2019 FFO of $3.52, which I think we will get back to by 2022, and Multiple of 10x you’re looking at $35.2. NAV analysis at 6.2% cap rate used for Simon’s Taubman acquisition would indicate a similar valuation of $36. 

There’s no other stock on the market where you see this sort of 200% upside in such a brief period of time without assuming ridiculous growth assumptions. The only assumption here is that the REIT will trade at some point at the value of its properties - debt at private market valuations. Another point of note is that I’m also bearish on malls, but on class C and D malls. Those are shutting down left and right, which is good for class A malls. There hasn’t been a single class A mall that has shut down in the last 10 years. MAC has similar asset quality to SPG, primarily class A malls with some class B. 

The mall REITs were the best plays in 2009, with Macerich returning 700% in one year.

I have 30c april calls I bought last week. Should I sell and buy back after earnings?
You can't, and that's a great point AND reason why I ask these types of questions. It helps me refine my thought process to make an informed decision.
For VW, I’ve read that short interest was 13% and when Porsche bought it out the available float was about 5%. Gamestop’s short interest as percentage of float is even higher at 297%.

I'd tell you Virgin Galactic took the entire time SpaceX used to develop Falcon 1, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship to get one suborbital rocket flying. And currently has nothing more than powerpoint slides to show for any follow on rocket.

Show me literally any hardware for this "follow on rocket" that will need to be flying in less than four years to compete. Much less compete with a rocket nobody else can come within an order of magnitude of competing with.

Anyone who thinks Virgin has a Starship competitor is delusional.

I’m in the same boat. I’ve almost ordered a call a few times and then my ignorant quivering asshole tightens and I stick with pouring money into SP500.. which has been slowly successful, but not as exciting as what I see some of you guys experience
Honestly speaking- 

Do you know the true value of the company per share based on book prices/assets? Have you run any sort of sales analysis or profit analysis?

If you’re basing the entire hope on a squeeze, it is dependent on how long the other investors hold. Because as soon as more start taking profits the squeeze ends. That could be at 20. 25. 30. 35. Etc. there’s a good basis to know when to expect it, when pricing has too far exceeded valuation. People will sell.  If book is 20, when it hits 40 do shares get dumped? What is burrys exit price? Cohen? 

Bottom line, $50+ sounds absurd based on the company prospects and is entirely squeeze dependent. How can you say with any certainty that at $40 the WSB autists plus burry and Cohen don’t all liquidate?
Isn't there a chance that they wrapped up all the years major loses due to pandemic and closures into last earnings, with the msft deal hitting this earnings and all the new consoles hitting guidance making it an epic earnings report?

It's now or never on this stock. The next administration will not be interested in releasing FNMA.

Looks like it expired worthless to me. Probably set a limit price but it didn’t execute. At end of day it probably “filled” by expiring worthless.

Puts are a little bit like buying insurance for your stock. It's a contract which lets you sell a stock at a certain price. You would buy put contracts if you anticipate a stock will go down.

You can also sell calls and puts, which have the opposite sentiment. You sell call contracts if you anticipate the stock to go down. You sell put contracts if you anticipate the stock to go up.

So if you predicted a stock would drop tomorrow, you'd buy a put now, and keep your selling price high, provided it actually does drop?
Hopefully this will make us all a little bit less retarded.
This is sound.

Weekend dow turned red. Was green.  Not looking good.
If you buy a $10 call option and the stock goes to $15 at the end, that means you can buy 100 shares at the $10 price (plus the $50 premium you spent to buy the contract) 

If it drops down to $2, you effectively lose your $50 premium and your contract is worthless, because you don’t want to exercise that contract. Nobody would pay $10 for a $2 stock.
I would compare to Uber and Lyft...   then decide your play

He was doing a put credit spread which involved selling a put at a higher strike price and buying another put at a lower strike price, giving him a credit. Because it was done over the weekend, the Robinhood app erroneously displayed cash balance of one side of the spread. Had he just waited until the following Monday, it would have shown him his correct balance.

I honestly do believe though that, much like a casino, you can to a degree educate yourself: Do DD, learn to do at least some level of technical analysis and learn how business works in general. If you get a good grasp on things, then you look at it like a run in poker. It's not about winning every hand; just gotta keep things above 50% winrate if you will.

If Tesla opens higher then $600 tomorrow, I promise I’ll sell my call and not get greedy. 😉

Its similar. They connect individuals who offer a service to indivudals who need that service, in both scenarios the companies don't own anything else other than the platform to connect these people. Both are in the travel buisness.

Also, dispite making 20-30% on each booking with other people doing the actual work, they somehow manage to lose 100 millons of  dollars each year.

I also eat very little sugar, and it has been great for my overall health. 

It has amounted to me cutting out basically all fruit.
The $50 part was the simplification and a little fuzzy math since things decay as the option moves closer to expiration, but leaving that aside I’ll try to answer. 

The option pricing should leave the investor indifferent between the option and owning the shares.

So to buy 100 shares @ $10 = $1,000

If it goes up to $12/share = $1,200

That’s the total outlay. 

So for the option contract, how do you capture the $200 gain in the price? 

$200/100 shares = $2 increase per option contract. 

So if you purchased the option contract when the shares were at $12/share, your premium would be $2 plus (some varying amount based on time to expiration, volatility...etc.).

So option premium $2/share = $200

Option contract gives your right to buy @ $10.

Exercise the option and buy the shares at the strike price costs $1,000 ($10x100).

Total cost = $1,200. ($1,000 purchase plus $200 premium - for 100 shares)

Current stock price = $12

Selling 100 shares at $12/share = $1,200

So, you breakeven. It leaves the investor indifferent between owning shares or owning the option contract.

The fuzzy math part is why in real life, the breakeven price for this strategy does not exactly match up. You pay more premium for a longer dated contract, for example, and that decays over time as you move towards expiration. Volatility of the underlying stock can increase premiums if it is high volatility and decrease premiums if low volatility.

A call is cheeper than 100 shares so if you can’t afford or don’t want to own the shares you can still take advantage of them. It’s less risky than buying more than you can afford with margin because you can only lose what you pay for the call. 
If you sell options you get the money the person paid for the call as well as the strike price for your shares, so say I want to sell 100 Ford shares if they reach $11. I could sell monthly call options on those shares with a strike of $11 and get paid for selling the option every month until they sell.

You can’t buy options pre market. What broker are you using? I’m thinking there will be time to get in Monday. This stock doesn’t gap up like others. I’ve noticed from following this stock and the options activity for it that with the high OI on that otm strike that’s still over a month out, there’s a very good chance that it will be itm before it starts getting too close to expiration. I hope to have enough money to actually exercise if this plays out the way I want it to so I get the shares. It’ll be my first option that I do that with.

I’m in the Robinhood app. Where do you go to trade options?
Not sure why you feel the need to make two hype comments in this thread. Before you even bought it. But here is Wall street journal with a more sober take on the IPO:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-ipo-filing-shows-profitable-quarter-after-deep-cuts-11605564419

Airbnb **lost $697 million** through the first nine months of the year, **more than twice as much as it lost in the year-earlier period**, underscoring the toll of the health crisis. Revenue dropped 32% over the nine-month period.

The home-sharing platform’s ability to resuscitate to profitability and proceed with an impending public offering show how unpredictable—and yet ultimately navigable—this year has proven for some companies

**Airbnb cautioned**, however, that a recent surge in Covid-19 infections in Europe **could damp its prospects for the fourth quarter**

**Mr. Chesky quickly pivoted to raising capital to keep the business afloat, laid off a quarter of staff and shed noncore businesses.**

Airbnb is expected to garner a valuation of roughly $30 billion in its offering. Airbnb’s valuation fell to $18 billion when it raced to secure a loan as bookings plummeted earlier this year. 

Airbnb has been under pressure to list this year because some employees lose their stock options next year. **The company said it would allow employees to sell up to 15% of their shares when it lists in December.**
Ok now that changes things
Thank you finally someone explains it in the format it’s always posted here

I appreciate that. I knew it wasn’t a great example, was mostly trying to get validation on the thought process. I’m currently testing to become a life and health insurance agent so I’ve been learning about annuities and shit like that, and I felt it might be a microscopic springboard I could use to finally learn about stonks and investing. 

Options are basically just higher risk/higher bets on short term spikes, as opposed to shares that are a longer term investment, with arguably less risk and less reward? 

The only other thing I’m curious about is the absolute basics of calls vs puts. 

After that I figure I’ll be able to translate this sub more easily and learn from there.

Update on sugar reduction. Kanzi apples are too sweet for me. Trying out pink ladies next. Feels better knowing that I’ve cut out at least 80% of all the sugar I use to eat. However, now I can’t really bake cookies since I’ll just tell myself, “No, you can’t eat that,” and that’s honestly the most depressing part of this life style change.

Position-wise, sold $AAPL $127c and hoping for a run up. If I get assigned, fine. If barely dodging assignment, even better. I’m 4% away from hitting 20% ROI on my Roth IRA before the year is over. Still want to play $TNA but the rapid run up is scaring me, that ain’t normal to me but what is normal now in these days?

I have honestly read a bunch on options trying to figure out what you retards are doing in here. (It's sheer jealousy of the big gains posts and a little bit of ego butt hurt not being able to understand) That explanation actually made sense to me.

you've bought the option when it was worth $50, so if you exercise it after it becomes $250 then you're getting all the 100 shares for $1000 and can sell them for the share price of $250, OR you can directly sell the option to someone else for $250 who thinks that the option will go even higher. 

You don't buy a $250 option and exercise it there and then without any activity (up, if it's a call option). 

You let it expire if it goes down but only exercise it if it goes up.
But even on weeklies the price of a stock can shoot up 15% or more. I know it's unlikely but the premium for weeklies is so small for deep OTM options it hardly makes it worth it.

So ideally with the fractional shares, is it best to buy more volatile stocks in the gamble of actually making profit? Doesn't seem like the larger/ popular stocks move too much. Or just buy them, sit on them, and wait till they make a profit?

A put gives the buyer the option to sell someone 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. Think of it like a call going the other way. If PLTR is at $25 and I sell a put with strike $22, I'm selling someone the right to sell me shares of PLTR at $22. They are betting the stock goes down, because if PLTR hit $18 they could buy shares from the market at $18 and sell them to me at $22.
Dude what is this fucking knight dance
Worst case, you just sell a ton of CSP's and collect another absurd round of premium to get back into it. I have 5,500 shares @ $18.35 and I've been selling weeklies. Can make a ton of money even if the stock just trades sideways for awhile.

You find a girl who has them and you just grab em and don’t let go. Sure, she may call the cops on you, but whatevs

(Real answer, someone sold the call contract to me)
He loses his shares at a pre determined price. His cost could be $20. And he could set cc strike at $30. If they got called away thats still 50% gains plus the cc premium.  Not bad for a stock he just bought.

What did you buy?
I started out shorting travel when they peaked 6 months ago, that got me to 2.5k where I made a margin account, bought fcel and various other hype ev/tech. Sold them all for good profit, than I bought abunch of recovery stocks/oil and am currently riding that wave. Also abunch of other hype stocks/low cap stocks in the mix
For the love of god plz
Yeah but WSB doesn't really work that way. 

You basically chose a meme stock.  2 weeks ago it was PLTR and you buy calls .

You don't have to understand the company, you just go with the trend.

To make money, you have to do what nobody talks about on WSB, not being an autist gambler.
This is just the closest they’ve been. They’re still several hundred AU apart.
Damn you
Smart
I’m here from the front page so this may be a dumb question... who sets the premium to $50? Isn’t that like buying $1000 worth of stock (100* $10) for $50?  Is it because you have to sale the stock at the end of the period? What happens if the stock goes down $2 instead? Does the premium go to -$150 instead? How does that work?
Correct. Buy the 700, sell the 750. Max profit is 5k minus cost. 

This also helps mitigate massive iv crush

That's why they're calling it "yolo". Just jump in once with whatever you're willing to lose.
Your thought process regarding how to use options effectively is correct here. Meaning, yes, one way to play them is event driven.

However, that specific example I would exercise a lot of caution on. I know it seems like this was recently announced, but I think it has been known since at least October. And if you look at the price movement for CVS over the last month, it’s up 23%, so it’s likely this is already priced in to the shares.

This is why you see others recommending LEAPS or long dated maturities on options, because it helps to offset some of the timing risk in your bet. In other words, there is time for you to be right. 

I’ll try to answer any other questions you have because I know this stuff can be confusing. But I will also say that I’m nowhere near the most knowledgeable person on this sub.
More OTM calls? Deal!

I bought 1/15/21 calls on Friday EOD on the chance that it starts this good movement over the weekend. If the stock drops below 3100 I’ll probably exit them. If not I’ll hold them for a couple weeks
If that actually happened you wouldn't be posting here but nice try
Interest rates today (~0.09%) are at 1/16 of the rates in January (~1.5%) this year. In addition close to 25% of the current total dollar supply has been printed this year.

Based on this assets should be trading close to ~21x (16 x 1.33) compared to January, all other things equal. This is not the end of the bull runs. Stocks, real estate, gold w/e, BUY. Cash is trash.

A lot of MMs short gme and retail and buy Amazon and tech. 

This has been an extremely profitable trade for the last 10 years and gme is such a small part of the trade that most MMs don’t even notice- we have talking funds with hundreds of billions shorting a company that was worth 300 million in total. 

Also, PTs for gme are as low as $1.6. A lot of hedge funds think that the recent price action is temporary euphoria and their short position will be proven correct. That is why heads will roll when this stock pops to $500 🚀🚀🚀😎
Seeing Guliani just turns my stomach, anymore.
It is entirely up to your risk profile wether or not to buy more. If you can afford the risk, I think this is a good one. IV took a good spike on Friday, so it is pretty high on these and we haven’t seen much movement in stock price. Monday is a pivotal day for the market so I’d wait and see what happens early next week to potentially scope an afternoon reentry.
Lol, you can work remotely, right? Why aren't you in Mexico or somewhere cheaper with good quality of life?
These are not the actions of a company in hyper growth (which you want for a tech IPO), but for a company in distress. Which is not really their fault because their buisness is hit by the pandemic. But you don't want to over pay for something like this. Which you certainly will on the IPO day. If you are planning to find a bigger idiot, then you can try that - but remember more often than not, you're gonna be the biggest idiot.

It was pulled from NYSE and now trades on OTC. Basically all the profits for the last ten years are just being dumped back in to the treasury every year. Insane amount of capital. They are just bleeding it dry unlawfully. Its taken time to get to SCOTUS and like always, SCOTUS forces the hands of the gov agencies/politicians.

Re your question:  "Even though Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are technically shareholder-owned, they have been under government conservatorship since the Great Recession. Many investors who hold stock in the two companies are eagerly waiting for them to emerge from government control so their stock can trade on public exchanges again."

So no. The gov has FNMA in this conservatorship limbo where they just steal the profits every year and dump into treasury. FNMA has paid back all of the original loans given out in 2010 to keep the company afloat and then some (over 10% in interest so far). SCOTUS is gunna mangle the unlawful gov practices.

This company is a juggernaut. It trades at $2.50 because its been in conservatorship so long and people have now just wrote it off (lots of hype in 2016 with no changes). Lots of material changes since then, most notably, finally going to SCOTUS. It's a situation where the boy cried wolf, but the wolf is at the door now (SCOTUS). Time to get in for tendies, folks.

Shouldn't the adjustment on the premium be less than the gain in the share price? Otherwise, there wouldn't be any incentive in buying options.

Going back to your example, let's say I buy your option for $250 and exercise it. I will then be having 100 shares of that stock which I acquired for $10 each. So the total money spent including the option premium is $1250.

How is that better than just buying those 100 shares directly?
Lmao ilhan likes incest

Instead of buying stocks, sell to open puts.  Also, sell to open calls on stocks that you already have.  Basically get paid to buy shares that you already want at a price & date you set and get paid extra to sell shares you already have & wouldn't mind selling for the right price.

Respond with 
“ I’d already be doing it when you say it ;)”
Essentially, if a stock runs up, the market is pricing in a pullback or a correction in the long term, but maybe not in the next 2 days. 

This means if a stock runs up the increase can be more than the increase in your leap, so you are negative on the trade. 

This does not happen with shares since you just get the calls assigned.

Its best if you have the risk tolerance. Just take a look at some of the losses around here and understand the really might be you. Without a well thought out plan, and research, you're basically just gambling.

If you have no trading experience its better to start with stocks. On robinhood you can get on the waiting list for fractional shares. You can buy parts of shares. Get into multiple companies, diversify, and experiment.

You can also make a paper trading account on TD Ameritrade so you can experiment with options without risking real money

I dunno, as someone who is a stronger-willed version of likely the same personality type as he had, his life didn't seem to be problematic anytime prior to this year. Just an eccentric guy with money and was doing things that made him happy. 

The reason he was cutting people out of his life is because they don't understand the fact that it isn't a problem. What appeared to be problematic to outsiders was not at all. But losing social interaction and freedom takes a big toll on these personality types, because it disintegrates their entire in-person social network.

It's not a good investment compared to the market when you factor all in costs and the upfront of a 20% down payment. I'm not saying it's a bad investment, but it's not a good pure investment vehicle if you aren't enjoying the housing and safety net benefits associated.

I wouldn't make the mistake of assuming the USG is not behind. It is. Diversity and inclusion programs have been in place the world over for decades before it really took hold here.

Ah yes I see where I’ve been going wrong
I keep coming across stocks like LAZRW and KXINW, same company description in the information on the stock, but the name always has Wt. at the end.

I presume these are "weighted" stocks? They always cost less than the real stock, but they also always move further in the same direction as the real stock is moving. I.E. LAZRW was up 64% Friday, LAZR was up 36%.

No options, but if the swings in price are going to be almost twice what the original stock swings, who cares right?

What am I missing about these stocks?
Thanks! Appreciate the feedback

 **The Supreme Court will take up one of the cases involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac starting on Dec. 9. Tim Pagliara of CapWealth Advisors questions what Mnuchin will do, given the fact that the case involving the government-sponsored enterprises has gone all the way to the Supreme Court. He said that from talking to legal scholars and attorneys who are involved in the case, it seems clear that the government is going to lose.**

**"They're going to lose on the issue of whether or not you can create a loan for a troubled company in a statutory conservatorship that they can never repay and violate the basic principles of conserve and protect, which is what their mandate was under the statute," Pagliara told ValueWalk in an interview.**

**Pagliara added that the Supreme Court essentially "mocked \[Andrew\] Cuomo over the inconsistent application of steps for public safety." He said five justices on the Supreme Court are very no nonsense, and he expects them to point out how absurd the situation involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is.**

**"They're going to finally say the same things we've all been thinking since 2012," Pagliara said. "That it's absurd; you can't create a statutory remedy like the third amendment sweep that perpetually keeps companies in** [**conservatorship**](https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/11/fannie-mae-bull-case/)**."**

**Pagliara believes Mnuchin will declare that the senior preferred shares are paid, which he said is the right thing to do. He also believes that if Mnuchin doesn't do that, the Supreme Court will.**

Market wars: Episode III - Revenge of the bears

Coming 2022
One question I need to know. If I invest $6000 in the market for like 30 shares of a company, and the next day it’s doubled to $12,000, can I just pull out with the money? Why do so many people make it big and then lose it all? It is cause we’re tards or are there reasons?
Chicken tendies will satisfy me way more
Streets ahead of me, that's for sure. Wish I traded paper for a months instead of jumping right in.
If you hold the security for more than a year it’s up to 20%. But if you crush it in less than a year, they tax it as part of you income tax. So this guy might actually be like 37% I think.

Chinese..chicken and broccoli my boi
Bro is that bee gonna pop up already /(
The price of the contract is always listed as the premium of one share. But since a contract is always for 100 shares, you multiply it by 100. So, for instance, if you open an option chain on Robinhood and see a price of 1.00, the actual amount to purchase it would be 100 dollars for that contract. If you see 0.01, then the price to purchase that contract is actually 1 dollar.

Best way to get over one is to get under another.  Same theory works for stonks.
I know it's a meme, but in case it's helpful, here's my oversimplification: it's gambling. You can bet on a stock (call), but you can also bet against a stock (put).

You choose a date and price that you want to gamble on. If your price starts to look more likely as your date approaches, you can sell out to take some profit and run. If your price starts to look less likely as your date approaches, you can sell out to cut your losses and run.
Lol it was a joke you fuck.

I’ve been investing for over 20 years and would love to help.

Calls - these are what you avoid after you’ve invested a lot of money in just one stock and then that stock tanks and now you’ve got no money.

Puts - is what you do with money you earn from your third job that you work after losing all your money from the tanked stock; you puts it aside to invest again.

Options - are what your ex-spouse gives you before you already invested your Puts into that same stock that tanked.

Glad to help, gotta go now because I think the library staff notice my smell.


— This message has been sent from my tin can.
Yes, contracts can be traded just like stocks can. The reason you see such huge gains and losses are because they are highly leveraged since each contract controls 100 shares. Take for example that million dollar Tesla option guy. He bought those contracts for super cheap, probably because they were so far out of the money last year. But as you know, Tesla has been on a massive growth streak and his OTM contracts that he got for super cheap are now deep in the money. If I recall, he owns 20 contracts which gives him control of 2000 shares. Basically, every dollar that Tesla goes over his strike of 136, he makes 2000 dollars. Since his contract is close to expiration, his contract is almost purely intrinsic value (stock price - strike price). So if we took the current price of Tesla at 599 and subtract his strike price, we get 599 - 136 = 463 X 2000 shares = 926,000. That is the power of options.

Considering that Theta fucks you, it's not bad to be Cash if you play options. Makes sense to wait for a good play instead of always having your money somewhere.
Another person in the market.
I’m holding shares in NIO after making a killing on calls. Converted a call to 100 shares. Cost $700. Otherwise I’m not in EV or batteries either. Weekly calls for SUMO SNOW. Looking at C3 AIRBNB Affirm IPOs. Good luck bro hope you hit a couple 5 baggers this week 👍
Every single time NIO has dropped under $40, the RSI switches to oversold, and it quickly recovers, within minutes. Without some kind of wonky negative news,  I see this as the floor.    Anyone buying puts after the last week is in for a really bad time.  

I believe this delisting bs will start to fade away, as people realize the US is not going to remove 8% of the market.   We might weed out a couple shady chongs,  but companies like Baba and NIO are not going to be delisted. 

As soon as they release their firm plans on the move to Europe in 2Q 2021,   I'm sure we will be seeing some more parabolic action. 

To answer your question about NIO day, any press for any company normally invites new potential investors to look into the company.    NIO day will put a positive touch to the shares. 

Currently holding just over 5k shares, and a huge amount of 4/21, 5/21, and 6/21 C

You can't even get the ticker right retardo
If I have 100 shares I can sell you a call if I dont think I the stock price will go up enough for the call to make money.

I get to keep the premium no matter what. But if the stock price soars, I lose potential profit.

Because I had 100 shares, and agreed to let you buy them for $100/share. If you do that, while the market value is $110, I lose out on that $10/share profit.

But if the stock price is under $100 share, I get to keep my 100 shares, and the premium you payed me.

Its also important to note, you can still make money by selling your call to someone else, you don't need to buy my 100 shares to make money. Because that would cost $10K. Selling the call to someone else usually is worth the same as the profit you'd make buying and then immediately selling the shares.

No I sold the right to buy TSLA for 600, whoever I sold that contract to decided to exercise their right to buy 100 shares of TSLA from me for 600 when TSLA closed at around 598.50. So effectively bought at above market price outside of trading hours. The only reason someone would do this if they thought TSLA was gonna gap up on monday, if it does then I'll be short 100 shares aka fucked in the ass.
They always say to inverse wsb. Poeple are saying not to touch. This is a difficult one chief. Will it get pumped by all the retards like its 2000. Or will this be rational
I am 50% cash now, and I'm going to cash out about 60% of my remaining calls this month in exchange for OTM LEAPs in the same tickers.

Because you’re betting money on it lol. And Tesla premiums are expensive. Don’t forget you have a lot of things like theta and potential IV crush working against you too. It’s also way more difficult to try and time puts instead of calls

No. In fact is just 2/3 drop. Or 66.66% down.
With spreads, the same way you subtract one option from another then multiply by 100 to get a lower entry price, you have to the same with the stike price.( 800-750)100=
Lockdowns have decimated small businesses (not that they weren’t already on the way out). Corporate welfare is instituted by FED policies out of necessity because of a debt laden system.

Sell 62 contracts of $30c expiring on 12/11 for a premium of about $1200 (considering theta and a flat open) on Monday. If it hits $30 this week, then you just made $40k after assignment in a single week.

HF is actually a piece of dog shit of a company but there’s some major buzz about the IPO among the “weed funds”...   all the big ones are coming in.  I’m jumping in for the hype and I’ll dump this thing the minute it hits my target.  I’m in the industry and this company is in bad shape so definitely not even thinking about long term hold...  I expect they’ll do a secondary or follow on offering very shortly to raise much needed capital...  that could go either way, grow gen did it and blew the fuck up because they used the money right...  but generally dilution in a struggling company is different than dilution in a company with heavy positive momentum.  Thats my thoughts on that
We can all win in this wonderful game. Just buy and sell at the right time!

But in order to cash in that profit, would you need to have money to buy them at the strike price? Or do the stocks get transferred over to you immediately once the contract expires? I'm asking because I have $50 on stockpile id like to try to make a call on TSLA with but don't have any more money atm to do anything else with.

The pent up demand is off the charts. Just look at what happened after 911. Also, valuations are totally meaningless in today’s market where the fed is like the hand of god protecting all equities tied to boomers pensions and retirement accounts.

so its says the margin interest rate for robinhood is 5% and for sites like TD ameritrade 9.5%(less than 10k) how is it calculated for the contract period, and for beginners like me trying to get in with small amount would it makes more sense to get robinhood?

Correct, but the higher the potential upside, the greater chance that you will actually lose the whole thing.
If it memed once it can be memed again
Premium will never be 0 dollars. The least the premium can be is 0.01 x 100 shares = 1 dollar. If you go look at options that are far far out of the money, they can be 0.01. This is how some people get huge gains, by buying 100’s of contracts that are far far out of the money and then some miraculous news hits and the stock shoots up beyond their strike price. The chances of this happening are low and more akin to purchasing a lotto ticket.

Agree.  Most Casinos blew past ATHs, due for a correction in MGM, BYD, CZR, PENN, WYNN and LVS.  Online gambling isn’t gonna make up on lost revenues, consumer habits are changing.  I doubt people will be returning in flocks next year.  People are rattled.
This is pretty much it.  To be this short float means that the squeeze hasn't even started.  It also means the the squeeze will be fast and crazy.  Study VW in 2008 to see a glimpse into what to expect.
You can’t even define addiction.

If Senate is divided and FDR era programs don’t happen, I agree on this one. The second the Georgia races look evident, if they go red, then one could expect gridlock on meaningful main-street political job and support solutions, which will cause a significant uppermiddle, middle and lower income worker fallout, insolvency and defaults.

One minor correction: an ITM contract isn't, by itself, profitable. ITM is when the contract will have value at expiry, but that value may still be less that what you paid for it.

To profit at expiry, the underlying must be above breakeven, which is strikePrice+premium.

If you go back and look at the meme stocks this sub pumped in the last calendar year, buying stocks probably could have netted you bigger gains than buying ill advised options.  TSLA, AMD, PLUG, PLTR, NIO, all up massively on the year.  I bought like 10 shares of PLUG at $2 before it was memed and that shit is sitting at like $25 now.  Wish I had just emptied my savings account into it this time last year

So the key here is to manage your contract. It is always advisable to sell your contract before expiration. If you do, however, let it expire, what happens to it depends on the brokerage. Most brokerages will exercise your contract so you would end up with 100 shares (or however many based on how many contracts you have). If you do not have enough buying power, most brokerages will either sell the contract for you or buy the corresponding number of shares and then liquidate it.

Maximbrutii did a good job explaining what an option is and I'll give the dumbed down version.

Options are insurance, it gives you the ability to buy into a stock and minimizing your risk.

The price goes up, you can make a lot of money, in theory, infinite money. Price goes down, you lose your premium you paid for the insurance.
I have some good position I've been looking at for Monday but don't want to share till I get in. Anyone else like that?
Eh, there are plenty of functional people who drink regularly and do drugs. Especially if they have unlimited money and free time. But he clearly made this lifestyle work for many years without issue. It was the lockdowns that pushed him into a much darker place.
Exactly. Your total loss can only be $100, but your much more likely to lose the whole $100.

If I put $100 into SPY (This a safe investment) with fractional shares (buying part of a share, only some brokers let you do this), I *could* lose it all but that most likley won't happen. Chances are in the short term I'll only make or lose a little bit of money. Low risk, low reward, but safe.

Options let you take a more dangerous high risk, high reward chance.

Well... It's coming from the value of the underlying stock. This is where naked vs covered options come into play.

If the seller of a call option already owns enough shares to cover his ass if all the contacts he sold go tits up, then this is a "covered call", and the seller _may_ also profit, albeit less than if he'd sold the stock at market value, if the strike price is higher than his cost basis.

Conversely, if the seller of the call option does _not_ already own the shares, then they must buy them at market value and sell them at the strike price. Thus puts his cost basis at market minus premium (how much he sold the contracts for), and the difference is now his loss.

(For puts, the cover is the cash needed to buy they shares at the agreed price, and is called a "cash secured put".)

So... The money value of a bought call is marketPrice - strikePrice + timeValue. As you approach expiry, timeValue goes to 0.
Fuck no we don’t more millionaire politicians in positions of power😂
it's just stocks but more
Question though... how the fuck were those premiums so low? If I wanted to do this with Tesla today, I would need to shell out like 10k for 1 contract.
Your forgot another two zeroes.
100 million vehicles a year market by 2030.  Tesla captures 20%.  That's 20 million cars.  Tesla will grow 40-50% a year compounded this decade.

Current market cap is saying Tesla will sell about 3 million cars in 2025.  I think Tesla will sell close to 5 million cars in 2025.

Tesla is shooting for 20 million cars a year by 2030.  If so, Tesla won't be trillion dollar company.  It will have 2+ trillion market cap.  Like I said, FSD alone is worth over trillion by itself.  Seriously, you know very little about bull case on Tesla.  You should be open minded and do simple math calculation on Bull case numbers.  But really I don't give a crap what you think about Tesla.  I already won.
Didn't europeans inject 1T+ of Euro at this point? It's less than in the US but it's still a lot. That would explain why EUR/USD pair didn't change by  27%.

Unless you’re in my city lol. Literally no jobs, but we’re the exception not the rule. Our city relies heavily on tourism, and degenerate gambling addicts.
He's telling the 100% truth. Shares in a contract 100% or more OTM expiring in one year is typically worth 0.08 - 0.30 cents. Have a look at any options chain yourself, then max the range x4 the strike and you have your biblical million dollar bet. The IV doesn't matter in those case, could be 10 or 100, you'll still yield the same returns.

If I recall correctly from the options volume at the time, hundreds of people placed bets like the OP at the same time, I could assume 50-60% of them left when they reached target, he's just the only one to not have a target and also go public with the gains. I wouldn't be surprised if some cashed out 20mill+, you'll never know them.

Gibson is pure swag... lets say you pay 1000 for a gibson... 700 is for pure brand swag and 300 guitar. They look cool and awesome... All the cool boys ever played it. So if money is not an issue go for Gibson.   
But ESPs are good guitar. you can get same quality for half the price of a gibson. like a 1000 dollar gibson is a low end gibson. but 1000 dollar ESPs are probably some of the best ESPs...

I feel your pain- after About a minute of any stock market video I get so incensed that these BS games are how money is generated in our economy that I find it hard to concentrate.

Stocks are not “invest in a company and as that companies value increases you share in the profit” as we were told as children.

It’s more like “perception and market manipulation cause stocks to go up and down and you can capitalize on all this unreality with a million different side bets and con games invented by people with REAL money!”

later as in the next tax year, yes, but also maybe. Any carry forward losses can be deducted from future gains. the 3k cap is just against ordinary income.
No, If you're buying calls or puts you can only lose the money it costed to buy the contract.  Selling options can cause you to go in the negative.
I just look at their chart. I did 1 year for all. Even YTD's look shitty. Flip your phone right side up. I should note I was just saying they are all down. I'm not fucking with any of 'em... anymore.
Literally so stupid. The closest we got to a liquidity crisis was March. Fed and treasury came in and backstopped literally EVERYTHING. Debt markets stabilized in a matter of weeks and now here we are at all time highs while you’re spewing idiocy about an incoming crisis. What, do you think policymakers will just forget about what literally happened six months ago? Big time stupid my man. trying to use the last crisis as a blueprint for the next one.
I bought a put option for like $30 on Hertz because I learn by doing and $30 was an amount I was ok with losing. Well we’re approaching the end date and I’m nowhere near learning what they are or how they work. Best I’ve been able to gather it’s like a dumb short sale.
Well it seems like you don't, because you can actually reduce the risk of a portfolio consisting of 100% stocks when you use the correct additions.
The premium is just money.  If you sell a contract it goes into your cash stash. If you buy, it goes to the option seller.  The option itself has intrinsic and extrinsic value.  Extrinsic value (time value) is comprised of hopes and dreams. It slowly evaporates (theta) up to expiration date.  Intrinsic value is comprised of cold hard dollars.  Neither value is written in stone, they fluctuate with time remaining and underlying stock price.
Just sell your winners when you collect half of your premium. And don’t manage losers. It’s really that simple sped...

What happens if it goes down? Can you lose more money than you have in your account and actually owe money?
That's The IPO price, not the price it will begin trading at. IPO shares are organized through a bank and are only available to select organizations and individuals. All of this happens before the company is publicly traded.

Fuck spreads, I don’t like management
I'm having trouble understanding the purpose. Maybe I need more info on real world examples of how much a contract like this would go for. 

If the stock price is currently under $20, why not just buy 100 shares instead of the contract? If the stock price is already over $20 why sell a contract instead of just selling off shares?
Two different styles of music with those brands - what are you trying to play?

Lmao. Short it at the bottom.

Go ahead.
At expiry, are you then obligated to purchase the shares at whatever the strike price is? So it wouldn't just be that you'd lost whatever money you paid for it, right? You'd lose much more than that, although you'd also gain the stocks.

Lol, Europe and Canada are not doing fine at all with their "Socialism". Their Socialism is running on fumes and they need to rely on what amounts to foreign slave labor to keep it viable, as well as importing laborers while also having a 10% unemployment rate constantly.

Prior to earnings, there is no clear direction where the stock is heading, causing a major spike in volatility, but as soon as earnings are reported, there clear understanding where the stock is going leading to a massive drop in IV which leads to drop in contract prices.

don't buy GME for the short squeeze. It's just a bonus on top of it being fundamentally undervalued. If high short interest was all that mattered then you'd just buy garbage like AMC and hope they squeeze one more time before they go literally bankrupt

The point with GME is the large discrepancy between short sellers betting on bankruptcy vs the real situation. It's like all these institutional short sellers were ripped off by Gamestop's trade-in offers in the past and now they hate Gamestop irrationally

Crazy article in WSJ today about the founder of Zappos who died this week. This dude reminds me a lot of myself, and almost certainly died because he went crazy because of decreased social interaction during lockdowns.
He can also sell the contract right? Like let’s say he bought a contract to buy 100 shares at 1 dollar strike price but he doesn’t even have the 100 dollars available on cash to purchase the shares. He can then sell the contract for (hopefully) a higher premium than he bought it for right? As opposed to exercising the option and getting the shares.
Ok, fair point. I guess I just find it hard to imagine why there are still people adding to their short position currently.

> The program needs to exist Becusse the sad fact remains, America has a huge retirement savings problem. People don’t do it and therefore need that hand held by the government to do it for them.
However, those who are smart enough to plan,budget, save, live within ones means. Could take that money as invest it themselves and have a shit ton more than what ssa pays out

None of this is good for the markets. If retarded consumer debt taken on to impress people you don't care about on Instagram were to disappear, and everyone lived within their means, stonks wouldnt go up.... and "smart" people like us who are investing for retirement wouldnt profit as much

You open your book and settle into a long, quiet evening of reading. The bookmark the library gave you indicates you left off on page 367. Stephen Bull's *Trench: A History of Trench Warfare on the Western Front* has been less detailed than you'd like, focusing on amusingly emotional first hand accounts of soldiers, but you slog through it in hopes of discovering nuggets of strategy. You find World War 1 history pertinent to your efforts because it was the ultimate war of attrition. And because it predated ethical considerations now inhibiting modern warfare.

You scratch the new growth under your chin, and then your hand instinctually reaches for the itchy tag of your shirt. You stop yourself from tugging at it. The thrift store allows you to return clothing if you do so within a month, and this is how you have avoided doing laundry for 3 years now. Laundry detergent is a totally unnecessary expense.

An unexpected knock at the door makes you flinch and elbow your tea off of the end table, directly onto a stack of library books. You scream in horror as you inspect the damage. The coloring to the pages will be light, since you were using that tea bag for the fifth time, but the library will likely fine you nonetheless. "What, Mother!?" you bark at the knocker, knowing it is her because she is the only person who ever knocks.

She opens the door slowly and softly asks down the basement steps: "I wondered if you'd like to have dinner with me and Jim?"

"No!" you moan as you lay out the books, open, in hopes that they will dry. "I would not like to have dinner with you or *Jim*!" You spit the man's name with as much bile as you can conjure. Your mother has been much more nosy since Jim appeared, either because he explicitly instructs her to inquire about your health or, more likely, because his presence has awoken some dormant, dead, and forgotten hormonal part of her that cares for others.

As she closes the door, you assess the scene. The fines will be steep. $40. Maybe $50. This will undo months of work. And you had been so careful.

You sigh as you settle further into the trench of selling calls.

AT&T has got some internal issues
Not necessarily, there were a couple of things that made the retail sector special. One is they they took a massive hit in comparison to other sectors because of the bankruptcy narrative painted by Wall Street, but unlike other sectors (movies,cruise lines,travel) retail was actually still able to generate revenue through online the whole time. So they were limping, but not all the way knocked out. Nordstrom posted a surprise profit and that’s what ultimately let to the run up. 

I had 20k of my life savings that I earned literally, I’m not making this up, wiping ass at a elderly home for a living. I’m not special by any means man.

Question: what's the difference in what that guy did who put like 14$ in TSLA and made out with 14k versus me just putting in 50$ in stockpile app, if the performance of the stock goes wild again would I reach the same results or no because I didn't do some fancy calls etc etc like im wondering is there must be a multiplier when you guess right on these options versus just betting some money and buy a fraction of a share. Besides I think in stockpile you can't do any fancy betting, just invest a certain amount of money into a company and that's it.
Wow, you are really reaching and creating straw-man arguments. I provided actual, public quotes from officials while you provide baseless accusations and ZERO evidence. Sounds like you are the conspiracy zealot. 

“Economists thinking they can toy with the structure of the global economic system” 

Ok, this is by far the dumbest thing you have said yet (which is saying a lot). The world banks are LITERALLY developing central bank digital currency. China already began rolling it out. The head of the IMF and bank of international settlements are calling it “Bretton Woods 2.0”. Jerome Powell himself has talked about CBDC over and over again. This isn’t conspiracy shit, this is common knowledge.
My portfolio is the exact same thing as my partner's shrimp tank, but the shrimp turn money into joy.
Strike is the price of the stock. 

Calls mean up. 

Puts mean down. 

You don’t (and shouldn’t) hold an option until expiration. Sell if if it’s worth something before the date, even $1, let it expire if it isn’t. Preferably you sell it when it’s worth something more than you bought it. 

Morons on the sub buy cheap way out of the money calls hoping they’ll get in the money and become expensive so they can sell them. 

You could also not be retarded and sell options. Let’s say you plan to buy 100 shares of ford but 9.29 is too high. You can sell a $9 put which would require you to buy 100 shares at $9 if it’s 9 or below at expiration. 

The above would give you the price you sold it for (let’s say, 10 bucks) and you wouldn’t have to do anything unless it went to 9 or less. You can sell that same $9 put, putting up $900 collateral, every week if you want. You’d either eventually buy 100 shares at $900 or make a ton of free money. When you do get assigned, and buy the shares, you have all that sold option money to take off the price of the shares. Let’s say you did it 3 times. $30 total. You’d have to pay 900-30 which means you essentially bought 100 shares at 8.70. Instant profit if it was anywhere over 8.71-9

Anyway, you’re probably already lost. Watch this video once a week until you get it.

Close, you're paying $100 for $10,000. But you don't own the stocks. You have some level of control over them, but you don't get voting rights or dividends with them.

An option is a contract. This contract lets you at any point say you wanna buy those 100 shares. But you get to buy it for $100 a share. No matter how much more it costs.
It is unfortunate people are actually needing to depend on a stimmy. There is no one on either side in this government that cares about passing a stimmy. Best bet is prob to assume its not coming and try to figure a way to get by without.

So this bb is the new play.. Too late to get in at open?
one thing that i think im always confused is that, how much does someone has to pay when he is going to buy the call? is he going to pay only the premium, or is he going to pay the premium + the strike price X 100 shares?
Yeah the guys making contracts are
There is always a CP to every trade, even if it is a market maker. If that dude is holding those strikes that means someone somewhere has those on their books waiting to either buy them back or get assigned. They can either sell a fraction of the contracts to get the money to exercise the others, or they can find buyers who are looking to do the same.

If he sells in 2021, he's fine. His expiry is next year.
My personal advice is accept ANY money you play with as a loss. 

New or old, always expect your next play to wipe you. You'll be less surprised when you do, and you'll play smarter because you'll always remember the risk.
Anyone with 100 shares can write a call option. You can also write put option using money as collateral. Check out r/Thetagang if you’re interested in writing options.

> The markets can provide healthcare much more efficiently and cheaper here, they just need to wear down the power of these predatory Insurance companies

You sincerely believe, that in a capitalistic society where maximizing shareholder wealth is the primary goal for big publicly traded healthcare, that they would seek to lower prices to the "consumer"... out of the goodness of their heart? What?

If insurance companies were to magically disappear, healthcare companies wouldn't fight tooth and nail to find a way to keep and increase their margins?

The options are tied to the underlying price of the stock, but the premium paid adjusts/fluctuates to essentially remove the arbitrage.

So 1 option = 100 shares.

Premium is $0.50 = $50 for that option.

Let’s say the strike price is $10. And make it a call option.

Stock price goes to $12. 

If you owned the stock, you make a 20% return. For the option, the premium adjusts not the stock price.

So if you were going to buy the same option after it moved to $12, it should exactly offset the $2/share gain.

In 100 shares that equals $200 gain. 

So that call option premium went from $50 to $250 (simplifying a few things to show the move).

So then, our 1 option, consisting of 100 underlying shares, now costs $2.50.

So while the stock went up 20%, the option has increased in value by 5x.

The reason being leverage, since one option contract is priced on an underlying 100 shares.

No, you lose if it’s below 20 at the expiration, which, in his case, is on 1/15/21. So say it dips to 19 dollars a week before expiration, his contract is OTM and is only worth the extrinsic value but as soon as it crosses above 20 again, it’ll be worth intrinsic and extrinsic value. If it remains above 20 at expiration, then it will be worth whatever intrinsic value (difference between strike and current price) is left. It will no longer have any extrinsic value.

Good point. Hopefully there is some sort of official statement at some point.

I get that and I get what you're saying. But I thinknwe can agree our elected officials are useless. Imo if the government shuts down with no direct stimulus before Christmas the movie purge will be based on true events. Shits going to get real dark real quick. Hard working people got fucked over the first time because our elected officials are more retarded than the wsb collective. I've heard a few stories how single mothers or struggling mothers who have cash paying jobs didn't get the first stimulus after the government told their employers to shut down or get fucked. Next weekend if the government shuts down its going to be a dark few months for America.

Awesome response, one thing I’m still confused on, if you could please answer. I’ve never held a contract through to expiration, I just have sold to profit from the premium. If I hold the ITM contract through expiration, how does the broker handle that?
So what's up AOC? I'm a europoor but from what i'm following i see here name a lot this week. Is she running for 2024? She would be a good call tho if here pockets wheren't fullfilled of green energy lobby's.

They posted negative EV news on Friday. 15% of Cadillac dealerships will close rather than sell EVs. GM is spending all of its profit for the next 5 years to compete with Tesla. They’ve failed every step of the way so far. Every time they make a big EV announcement, 6-9 months later they’re retracting it, revising the cost, or retiring an EV. Where’s the Bolt? Do they have a software company to update their future EVs like Tesla and Nio?  I hope you’re right and an old giant US company can survive but I highly doubt it long term. But good luck bro.

I will never forgive you for misspelling "Grogu" and I hope you understand you will never deserve forgiveness.
A covered call would be when you buy 100 shares of a stock, and then sell a call on those 100 shares. It's "covered" because you have those 100 shares already purchased.

Let's say you buy Tesla at 500. 100 shares for 50,000. You then sell a call for a strike of 600 for $2,000 premium. Let's say tsla moons to 650 and your call gets exercised. You don't have a net loss, since you owned 100 shares @500 you gained the difference of the strike of the call and your stock buy in price plus premium. 

So you make 600-500 = 100 x 100shares = 10,000 + 2,000 (premium collected) 

$12000 total gain even though your covered call was exercised. 

You do miss out on gains though. If you didn't sell the covered call you would of had $15000 from the shares. But you sell a covered call to hedge your risk. So if TSLA went to 480 instead. You would of broke even since you got 2000 from selling the covered call.

Me too please
It’s just a promise to buy or sell a stock at a certain price.

If you buy a $100 call and the stock moves to $125 you can either buy 100 shares at $100 or sell the contract to somebody else (it’s worth at least $2500
You answered your own question.

And there simply aren’t enough shares in existence for the shorts to escape. It’s a long slow death or a quick one. They’ve opted for the former.
No, only if it's less than 20 at expiration. You do slowly lose money over the length of the contract though.

GME 1/15/21 20c
I got in at $10.80, then sold at $13.30 for a reason I can't even remember. I can rationalize buying back in at $12
So you are saying market cap should not be factored in when making an investment? $600,000,000,000 for a company that would take 700 to 800 years to make 600 billion is not overvalued?

I mean it isn't if you are living in a la la land (which is what tsla investors have been doing for years)....Saying, "well, well, well, in 5 or 10 years they'll finally hit 1 billion or 2 billion in profit".

Compare Tesla to other highly valued companies:

Google: Valued at $1.24 trillion earns $40 billion a year. Money back in 30 years.

Microsoft: $1.62 trillion earns $55 billion a year money back in 29 years.

Apple: $2.08 trillion earns $52 billion a year money back in 40 years.

Yes, I know, we are freezing most recent year when reality is in 15-30 years those companies will be making $100 billion a year. 

Tesla, valued at $568 billion made:
Q3 2020: $369 million
Q2 2020: $129 million
Q1 2020: $68 million
Q4 2019: $87 million. 

$653 million last 12 months. It would take 870 years to make your money back. They were founded almost 20 years ago and have lost money every year. Finally, in 2020 they are set to have their first profitable year since inception. 

They are nothing like a Google, Apple, or Microsoft and should not be valued as such.

If you don't have the capital to buy the 100 shares at expiration you need to sell the contract beforehand though right ? I guess a better question is what happens if you're in the money at expiration but don't have the capital for 100 shares?
Agreed 100%. Globally we're talking hundreds of billions of dollars annually in the tobacco market. And much of the world only smokes cigarettes compared to the high vape usage in the US and a few other countries.
That gambling is more important than your family.
Someone will buy so that they can exercise the option, or because they expect the price to increase further & then they can resell.

That was great.  The thing that I’m trying to figure out is how to calculate how much you are up or down?  For that 1/15/21 call.  If the price is 25 today, then how much money are you up?  If it goes to 30, how much are you up then? Is there a formula for this?  Is the number of days from the expiration date a variable?  I see people posting positions, but makes no sense how it got from $500 to several hundred thousand.  
Can you clear this up?

Boo. Su Bae also sold her shares at 14usd ea.
There are 68 million vehicles projected to be sold worldwide in the next year. You legitimately expect that Tesla is going to command about 30% of the entire global vehicle sales market? Over what time period do you expect that growth? 

The basic issue that the company faces is that cars are a latent industry. The number of vehicles required globally is itself not growing exponentially. There is basically a fixed number of cars everyone in the world needs, so the total addressable market is pretty well known. What you are suggesting is that Tesla is going to completely supplant the entire automotive industry and will become the biggest player by far within, let's say, the next decade? Not only that, the share price has ballooned to basically capture all of that growth already. 

For the sake of argument, let's say you're right and Tesla becomes a trillion dollar revenue company? That is twice the revenue of Wal-Mart. That means their current market cap has essentially priced in the overwhelming majority of their growth. There is less than 100% left to get to a $1T market cap. Do you think they will get a 10x revenue multiple once they have captured 30% of the entire global auto industry, despite the fact that at that point, they could only triple in size?
I get that and I’m sorry to hear that man. It sucks trust me I got layed off and denies plenty of times in my life.

Okay so without getting into a debate on whether it is real or not, if that dude that bought the TSLA LEAPs actually has those how would he sell or exercise those contracts?

Fuck you. You now have to buy more. Your new position will be 2345
You have to own at least 100 shares of a stock (say SPY) and you can sell covered calls on that stock based on your selected strike price. You gain the premium paid by the call purchaser no matter what. So the upside is you always get paid the contract premium. Only drawback is if SPY shoots up 20% and you agreed to sell once it hit +5%, then you just missed out on 15% gains - option premium.
What makes you so sure it will moon?

OP are you me?  

I started doing Robinhood towards the beginning of this year when there was the "loss post" and this guy in the comments felt bad for the OP said he could turn his $30 into $140,000 in about 1 year. So I said what the hell...ill just drop $30 into PINS like the commenter suggest to be the first step from $30 to $140,000...

Now the guy seems to have ghosted reddit about his journey from $30 to $140,000....and his "guide" on how to make it there. 

So now I'm sitting on 1 share of PINS at $67 atm not sure if that is the correct thing to be doing now lol.

That is a fascinating subject and one i could talk about for days. So many different avenues to approach it from. The publicly funded industrial military complex certainly exists but even still I would argue that is far better than a privatized military.
Cool story Hansel.
Smdh.
If you have Robinhood, it’s just selling the option instead of buying it. You need to have the stock held as collateral (you can’t sell it before the expiration date), or, if you’re selling a put, you have to have enough money to buy the stock at the price held as collateral.

The premium sold goes into your buying power and your accounts net value will be less the price of the option. If you have a hundred shares of XYZ and sold a call at a premium of $1 per share, my buying power goes up $100 and my net value goes down $100. If the option’s price goes down, to say $50, you could buy it back and hey you’ve profited $50. 

The only way that would happen though is if the stock didn’t go up (impossible, heresy) or if it isn’t likely to 🚀 moon 🚀 before the expiration date. If you don’t buy back the option before the expiration date you could get assigned (made to sell the stock) - you need to be careful of this around dividend payment time because folks will exercise their option to get more shares so they can get more dividend payments. If the difference in strike price and the dividend payment is positive, then it makes sense for them to get the stocks now. 

If you get assigned then you also get paid the strike price as well. Let’s say you bought $XYZ at $50. So if you sold a $1 call expiring 4/1 a strike price of $100, then on 4/1 XYZ is at $150... well hey you still came out ahead, just not as much as you could have. You made $100 selling the call, and $5k profit selling the stock at $100. You could have made $10k if you were able to sell at $150... but that extra $5k goes to the WSB chad who bought your call.

I’m such a stupid pussy for not buying PLTR calls Friday. Just holding onto my puts that I sold to 🌈🐻. But PLTR will moon and IV gonna be high which will suck for buying calls

Edit: wow you guys are like the seagulls from finding Nemo, I’ll just say it here I guess. Instead of dm’ing every kid on the short bus.

PLTR fell 15% in a week. On Friday, it found support at 23.90. I’m not a TA guy, but I do care about investor psychology. What does support mean? It means investors can’t agree. It fell below, was bought back. It rises above, it was sold off. No one can agree, it’s stuck at 23.90. What can break this level? A big move that is amplified by retail. If big boys come in and buy huge blocks, it’ll cause a noticeable pump which will signal retail to BUY, but the opposite it also true. We just had a 15% correction. There is no upcoming news that could be bad for PLTR. Is it more likely big boys but the dip or sell their shares?

There should be a more structured verification process. I’m a bit of a hacker do I know the more data points given the easier it is to get through verification channels and if 100,000 people view a video like that it is an exponential increase in risk of account compromise.

Learning that options trading doesn't mean you're actually buying stocks at these prices and instead buying the contracts to buy/sell at these prices really opened my eyes as to how people are able to make money doing this. It also highlights to me how easy it would be to gamble away everything with the price of entry being so low compared to the payouts. This is fascinating.

In my state corona is getting pretty bad. If we lockdown again we’re so fucked. Plenty of people I know are struggling financially and that would be the finishing move for sure. The only difference is who is actually to blame? Sure it sucks that people only got one check and then left in the cold being stringed along. But let’s be honest there are in fact jobs out there to apply to that can keep u afloat. May not be a job u want but it can get you by. The ones who complain the most to me about being broke are the ones who don’t do shit to fix the situation. I got off my ass and applied at plenty of jobs to get me by this year and they were awful but it was temporary. I researched the market and found ways to keep myself afloat through trades. Not hitting 10 baggers but inflation isn’t bending me over either. Just my two cents on the situation
I’ve been thinking Tesla will have another crash after inclusion as well, bringing down the entire market with it. Personally wouldn’t bet on it by buying puts. But keeping cash on the side would be a good idea.

Welcome. First step is to turn your account red like the majority of us.
/u/Jesus_Shaves_ this is a perfect explanation. Read it. Clear, concise, and to the point.

If you feel a stock will go up or down based on some information you have found, go to Robinhood and mess around with the calls, puts, different costs at different expiration dates. Then, it will hit you just like it did with me. It will all make sense. 

I recently paid (BET) $3 that Fitbit would hit $9 by sometime next year. I will make ~$200 if it is $10-$11. 

If you get into one of the meme stocks on here and it's blowing up, buy a call. All the autists here will literally put you in the money.

Sorry for picking on you, it’s not being right or wrong. It’s all about making money. If this makes money,  good for you, put your money where your mouth is and let’s see who makes the most.
I 100% agree. The fact that close to 30% of workers eligible for a 401k match opt out. Proves that point.
This might be dumb but how exactly do options pay like that? Is it the lender basically offers the option because if you’re wrong you lose way more money that goes to them? And presumably people are often wrong so they don’t mind paying for those larger odds if you’re right?

The opposite of this.
No the assumption is that it goes from $100 to $110.

You're paying $1 per share to get the option. But that price could be anything.

The stock price is still $100.

GM announced plans to spend $25Bill over the next 5 years in order to build and compete in EV. That’s their entire profit for those 5 years. 

Now news comes that Cadillac dealerships are choosing to close rather than sell EVs. So GM will now need to invest more into sales and distribution above and beyond the $25Bill.

GM is fuk. It’s such a boomer stock Motley Fool recommends buying GM not TSLA or NIO

This is the most informed I've ever been reading something on here.
Shit happens. I once had my car repossessed, and had to go to my father-in-law, hat in hand, and asked for $20,000 to pay it off. One of the worst experiences in my life. 

But you know what? He loaned me the money, basically took out a second mortgage to do so, and only made me pay pack what I could afford every month. It took me a few years, but I’ll be damned if I didn’t work my ass off to pay him back in full with interest. 

And now I’m in a position where I can help my kids when they get older and get into a similar situation. Parents should be there to help their kids. I want them to come to me when they need help, just like my FIL helped me. 

It sucks, and feels terrible in the moment, but I guarantee you that he’s glad you came to him instead of someone else. Just work your hardest and eventually you’ll pay him back. Good luck!
It’s not mental at all. There are 65M shares out now vs 102M a year or so back, which makes a big difference. If you think about the price to sales ratio and the rapid growth of the e-commerce business it’s very easy to see a re-rated GME trading over $100 by 2023.

The prospect of a months-long melt-up squeeze may simply accelerate that re-rating in 2021.

Sales will grow from the November inflection point forward, so let’s give the e-commerce biz a higher multiple and the core biz BBY’s multiple and you can see it’s not crazy at all. 

What’s crazy is the shorts are so convinced of bankruptcy and terminal value zero that they’ve completely fucked themselves

I've found the best way to do it with relative low risk is buy calls with long expiration dates and sell the option as soon as I hit 30% profit. Obviously 30% profit is not super exciting, and I've definitely sold a couple earlier than I should have that would have netted me more profit, but I'm seeing an overall gain. Been reading about theta gang, but not ready to try it out in the real world just yet

NIO has more room to drop. It’s still currently in a downtrend so I would wait till it reverses first. Definitely huge support around $38-40, but it could break depending on news. 

I think NIO day and a lot of other catalysts could send it flying, but at the end of the day it’s still a Chinese company. There’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding Chinese brands. Honestly I would rather yolo that money on Tesla if I were you.
It’s because there’s a lot of people like you out there that believe everything good out there is part of some big behind the scenes plot to fuck you over that we never get anything done. Europe and Canada is doing fine with their “socialism”. Chill out and take off your tinfoil hat.

There are several different ways to calculate theta.   Depending on the pricing model, it might be a standard 7 day week or a 5 day trading week. And to make things more complicated, it is never constant as the theta decays at different rates as the contract approaches 0DTE... The drop isnt an equal x/7 rate.

But in practice, the markets have usually already priced the weekend theta into the premium Friday afternoon...
Was thinking about it, any one you recommend? Needed something with a mobile app since I’m always working/never on my computer

Gme gang rise up and lemme know your thoughts on my thesis for this week.... 

Thesis: gamestonk payed ton of debt early..... but why? Some say its so they can have less debt on books and get stonk price increased. Well yes. But why pay early in this uncertain time. I think they payed it early, because they made bank this quarter and wanted to send a silent message. If you payed attention they haven't broken the silent period, but they have addressed a few of rc's points in their letter, or as much as they could w/o breaking silent period. Personally i feel like this earnings will be one for the ages. Pivotal imo. Gamestonk has payed a ton of debt early (already said that), but why, because they made Bank have plenty of cash on hand and will have a banger of an earnings. Imo this q will be positive by atleast +.03 eps or higher. I know a few people who dropped a few hundred on used games just to get the time to go by. Plus the market is forward looking. All it takes is one analist to say let's hear more about this Microsoft deal. How much money is estimated for gamestonk on this partnership. If the answer is 500 million or more over 5 years shorts are fried. 

Otm weeklie calls are risky. They may or may not pay out. If you have otm calls pull out by Wednesday or Thursday.

So imagine if you're really really confident a stock is about to go up...an option would be the best way to make the most money on that increase.  Even a 10% increase in price could be 2x+ on the value of an option...where a 10% increase if you owned stock would be 10%

Higher the risk = Higher the reward

I mean, who wants to be eating bagged ramen in a studio apartment in Hoboken when you can bet it all on three incredibly high-risk trades and eat filet mignon and bathe in Dom Perignon at your seaside villa?

What are your calls for TSLA around 21st this month?

edit: A guy on Etoro did some math that TSLA's cap will increase by 50% on inclusion day. Unless more shares are unlocked, doesn't that mean a 50% increase in share value?

edit2: That would be 12/21 800c, if I could trade options, but I'm stuck with CFD's.

Not everything. But the squeeze landscape makes this question difficult to answer. If the price is $100 and short interest is the same would I sell? No.
The grandparents on the above own real estate. They’ve named the grandchildren as shareholders in the company. In all likelihood this is an LLC. If the LLC holds real estate with mortgages and loan then the debt is not retired. It depends on the operating agreement and the state. While most debts cannot be inherited, it is not absolute with LLCs. You cannot inherit a house from a partnership and not have to pay the mortgage. A mortgage is a debt. If you own a mortgage on a house and you die, your wife doesn’t just get the house if there’s a mortgage.

I think Ive already commented in another thread that youre likely just going to lose money if you buy this on day one.

They have let go of like 25% of their employees

Cut all advertisement spending so that they can manufacture a profit for Q3 to put lipstick on their numbers for the IPO, while revenue is down year over year. 

They recently needed a 2 billion emergency injection, in other words they need cash more than ever.

All this would still be fine, if you were to actually buy the dip, since the brand recognition of Airbnb is excellent. Except youre not buying the dip 100% above IPO price, youre likely justing buying into FOMO.

But what do I know, maybe this will be WSBs new obcession. Might still be worth it to short Palantir then.

Oh no. None of this. The call option you paid x premium for is going to have more value when and if the stock price goes up. Then, when you’re ready, you sell it to some other retard before expiration. It’s really that simple. If you were to “exercise” and buy the 100 shares then it would be at the strike price. But you’re not gonna do that.
Lmao obviously I wouldn’t do it. I was just curious in a hypothetical sense

This is what I hate about alot of people that preach conspiracies. I like to look at other perspective myself, but when you present everything you say as the truth when in fact, its not, you lose a lot of people you are trying to bring to your side. 

Somehow the only facts you were able to provide are wording in a policy name, and reached to the fact they want communism.

Jesus I feel bad for people who are as brainwashed as you, my fucking god.
This is precisely why Australia is ass
True. There has to be a pull back relatively soon. I’m thinking after New Years we see a drastic pullback/correction

You’re missing a few things.

The console cycle has an outsize impact for a specialty gaming retailer. GameStop attaches 2x as many accessories and 3x as many games as mass merchandisers to consoles. Selling the consoles (especially early in the cycle) allows them to achieve very high attachment rates. 

Note the margin degradation you worry about would be more fair if the were only selling hardware, but consider that a massive portion have been through bundles (closet to 20% gross margin than the 10% for standalone consoles).

E-commerce fulfillment isn’t so expensive when you’re already leveraging a leased store network for placement and fulfillment optimization — they can offer same day delivery (new within the last ~month), in store pickup, etc.

And the closed locations comment is idiotic. They’re 90/10 strip to shopping mall in the U.S. Go-forward covid closure impacts will be negligible, potentially a positive as consumer entertainment dollars continue to be shifted to video games.

Not after seeing the price movement last week. Maybe it’ll hit 615 but I doubt we get anything crazy before inclusion.
It’s the same reason out of the money have value. They might not be in the money now, but the more time left until expiration, the more likely it could be in the money at some point.

Basically, even if a contract is in the money, it will be worth more than its exercise value.
People won't stand to let morons who opt out and went broke go homeless by the millions. 

Same reason we can't just ban the uninsured from using ERs. We'd rather have an inefficient system than see that ugliness.

"Earned" is subjective

No one "earns" a billion dollars.  They got there exploiting a rigged system.  There's no "self made" billionaires.  It's like playing monopoly but you only get to roll one dice while your opponent gets to roll two, he starts with 5x more money than you, and when he passes go he gets a thousand while you get a hundred.  Gl overcoming that
My guess would be if you still think the stock has higher to climb. If your exercise, you get the stock. If you sell the option, whoever buys it has the option to buy. I just started learning about this though so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
So I can never lose more than what I paid for the call/put but I can make way more than what I paid for said call/put, I feel retarded that I been missing out on tendies
I wasn't rooting for loss porn, but you better bet your ass I am now after this autistic onanist wankfest. No wonder MB deleted his shit after this response. You can bully people to keep quiet, but you can't bully the market to keep your bubble from bursting. Reality will come eventually, and then I will laugh my ass off.
Conspiracy? It's the truth.

If it weren't the truth, they wouldn't be advocating a program called, "Medicare for All". They would just be advocating "Healthcare for All". They specifically want to expand the reach of the Federal Government here, and aren't even trying to hide it.

The markets can provide healthcare much more efficiently and cheaper here, they just need to wear down the power of these predatory Insurance companies.
No... but I'm betting GLW will have to hit. Gonna need a shitload of vials for a long time.

You guys are all actually certifiably retarded.

PLTR started trading on Sep 30, 2020. He states that this is his portfolio as of Nov 29, 2020. There is nothing odd here.

OP is Canadian. Everything is priced in Canadian dollars, fucking retards.

Sorry you have to deal with these retards, /u/banana-flavour. It's a common disorder around these parts. A legitimate gripe I have is that you don't have any screenshots of covered call plays. Although you do have the capability of selling covered calls on multiple stocks you own, you only showed your current exposure and past purchases, but none for the sell-side.

first one to reply to me with some good points
Delta has to do with how much the value of the call changes for how much the price of the underlying stock changes (higher delta means your call increases in value even more for every dollar amount the stock price increases). Theta refers to how much the value of the call depreciates over time (calls lose worth as you get closer to the expiration date). This is why a call loses value sometimes even if the underlying stock is slowly increasing in price (because the price of the stock may not be going up quickly enough to counteract the depreciating value of the call contract over time). And this is why options trading to make money is gambling.

Or "iron condors are literally free money" until they suddenly go down 6 figures over night.

If you know you're retarded, at least introduce yourself as retarded. Don't try to act like you're anything more than that. I say this, as a retard.

1.8 was a “deal”. The Dems passed on it. Reps wanted much les.
Holy shit Australia has a stock market? I imagine even Australians don’t trade on it so what’s the point?
It's a Risk vs Reward.  Because an option is already in the money 6 month early it has value - for the moment.  You can either exercise the option and lock in the value earned (the safe and conservative option) or sell the option to someone hoping it continues to go up in value and will become worth more later, which relies on someone wanting to gamble but there's always someone wanting to gamble.  Selling usually is worth a tiny bit more because there's speculative value added ("it could be worth double tomorrow" - wsb autist), but you risk a bit by not just locking in your profits.

FWIW, exercising also requires you buy 100 shares of a stock at a fixed price, which might be beyond the budget of an options trader.  1 contract for Tesla might cost you $60,000 to exercise when you were only in for a $25 contract that's now worth $1,000.  Selling the contract is just more reasonable than exercising to a lot of people.
i don't think there will continuously be billions of more dollars spent on fancy freezers over a period of time that isn't short
Yes it’s a tax used that’s then borrowed from to spend more money we don’t have. 

Plus when it was implemented in the late 1930s, full benefits were 65. Life expectancy was 62. The program imo was created for those who made it past there working life and out lived there life expectancy. Hence a true safety net. 

The program needs to exist Becusse the sad fact remains, America has a huge retirement savings problem. People don’t do it and therefore need that hand held by the government to do it for them. 

However, those who are smart enough to plan,budget, save, live within ones means. Could take that money as invest it themselves and have a shit ton more than what ssa pays out. Plus ssa is only passed on to a spouse. After that it’s gone. You could work your whole life, pay into it and die at 70 collecting only a few years. 

I suppose the argument could be made, one who opts out could yolo it too on gme next week but that should be the degenerates choice!

This is some wild shit. 

Healthcare as a WHOLE is around 20% of GDP. Pharma, research, biomed devices, insurance, hospitals, clinics, billing, dietary, etc. 

Its not like an entire 20% of the GDP would magically go to the hands of exclusively Democrats who are in political positions. Shit, name me a democrat that controls medicare/medicaid money right now, personally, where the same cannot be said about a republican. 

Also, Medicare is already the largest provider of HCI in the nation, with the most satisfication btw, for the cheapest costs, bc they have the biggest dick. Private insurance will, from this point forward, *always and continue to be* shittier, more expensive, less efficient, and associated therefore with unnecessary higher healthcare costs for consumers, while providing businesses with a major financial barrier to overcome and preventing individuals from easily transitioning their career paths / personal lives.

Universal affordable healthcare, likely most expediently provided by a public option, will literally only harm the increasingly irrelevant private insurance companies, and will economically be a boon to everyone's liberty, health, and happiness.

Delta is what the difference the price of the option would change if the underlying stock went up or down, per dollar. 

If delta was constant at .5 and the underlying stock went up $3, then the price of the option goes up by $1.5. Delta does change as the underlying price changes, and that’s what gamma is. So say we have a gamma of .1 in the above, then after the price movement of $3 up, delta would then be .8

Theta is how much the option loses value every day. If you have a theta of -0.01, then tomorrow your option will be a cent less than it would be today. If theta was -0.1, then it’d be worth ten cents less tomorrow. 

Note that in these examples stonks are not mentioned and that is because they monotonically increase.

It's like buying a coupon for some apples for a fixed price, like $1 per apple, but the coupon expires tomorrow and the apples sometimes go up in value to like $10 per apple. So you take all of your money and buy these coupons and hope the price of apples go up before your coupon expires and then sell the coupon to some other idiot for more than you paid.

The value of the coupon drops really fast as you get closer to the expiration date, because the other idiot you are trying to sell your coupon to will say "wtf bitch this coupon to buy apples for $1 expires tomorrow and apples are currently worth $0.50. you can keep your coupon I'm gonna go back to having sex with your wife."

And then tomorrow comes and your coupon is expired and you have to deposit more money of your wendy's paycheck into your RH account so you can do it again.

Yes it’s old.  That’s what next year looks like though.  There is an end in sight here.
Little secret OP: A lot of what you hear about in WSB WILL hit, but it needs time, and so playing that in shares OFTEN works out very well where an option might be really hard to time right (options = timing). If this is your strategy... and it is making you $$$, do that.
Stonks only go up 70%/year. Options go up or down 100%/month. One of these things is true this year, the other is true every year.

A call is when you show a vertical line going up on stonks, a put is when you put your name on a few companies you'll buy and lose it all.
There was a great summary posted just a few days ago about this!

I'm right there with you. I find this stuff to be very complicated betting, having to keep a few "if/thens" in your head to keep track of how I can lose money. So I don't do it.

But the post was a great and fascinating read!

I come to r/wallstreetbets for the memes and read mesmerized the posts of wins and losses. It's like when I go to a casino. Not to bet, mind you, but to watch others as they sit focused on attracting fortune to their hand...

I think this is the most mediocre way to look at this. Pass all you want, but to be clear, the product that already exists is the chunk of a gigantic market (tobacco - 48 billion) that is the **leading killer of people**. And, supposedly per studies, ~65-80% of those people want to either cut down or quit. The value is far more than satisfying an addiction. It’s cutting down a very common addiction that kills many which affects all. The value is beyond price targets and capital gains; the value extends to human lives. There are many good people in this world who smoke and will lose their lives because of it. It’s time to end the trend and XXII is contributing, potentially significantly.

Couldn't you have entered almost any stock in March lows and made similar if not better returns?  I know I did...

It starts off as “just social safety net,” then it snowballs into making sure everyone is equal regardless of the circumstances. No matter how you label it, you’re permitting government to forcefully take money away from someone who earned it in order to give it to someone who didn’t earn it.  Socialists in America are free to start a large gofundme to spread their wealth at anytime.

Yes...I worded it badly....the point is that if you manage that size of a gargantuan amount of assets, your earnings will be big from fees.  EPS for black rock is like $30-40 this year and likely over the next couple of years. Meanwhile while SNOW has negative EPS and is worth more than black rock? Sure, different sectors, but come on, a company that makes that much  money per share is worth less than a company that makes negative earnings per share?

It’s called gamma hedging. Wall Street journal had a good article on it. Basically some people believe such hedging makes the market impervious to bad news. Unfortunately these hedges need to be rolled and so when that happens the reaction can be terrible. This explains last spring...market just did not react too news from China and kept on mooning and finally it crashed. It didn’t react appropriately.
I had it at 19 with a 22.5 strike. Sold at 23 cause I’m a dumbass. No advice here. Do better than me.
How people don’t understand this is beyond my comprehension. The societal acceptance of a BIGGER government is so disheartening
Probably means that the extrinsic value of the option prior to expiration would be included in the price of the option so that the total value of the option includes some additional premium (extrinsic). The value of the option would increase by its intrinsic value (($40-$20) x 100), and since it’s In The Money there will undoubtedly be extrinsic value ($) added.

I won't deny that it's about power, but the only reason the Republicans weren't willing to deal earlier was that they already had given up on Trump winning. If Mitch thought passing the stimulus would give Trump the edge, he would have done it because the austerity and fiscal conservatism is their minority position.
Mark my words: Airbnb is the next WeWork. Seemingly great idea but at the mercy of too many factors. Airbnb had competition (hotels) eliminated this year and where do business travelers stay? Hotels. I'm one of these people. Airbnb facing litigation in huge markets like London where I work with hoteliers. Once consumers begin traveling again for for business and travel, hotels take back their share, Airbnb faces shrinking supply and rising costs, rising lawyer costs and diminished markets of operation.

Are you me?

I took a break after a couple failed relationships earlier this year and working on myself for the last few months. Meditating every morning, exercising, eating well, etc.

Plan to jump back in to my former lifestyle (while being less of an asshole this time around) in a month or so but until then I'm focusing on other things. I do definitely miss it though and get lonely like a mofo.
Because large social safety nets take a massive bureaucracy to implement, which means significantly more people are dependent on government and therefore can be easily manipulated.

The reason Democrats want socialized medicine isn't because they  want to help people. It's because they want to nationalize 25% of the US economy, which would therefore increase their power significantly. The only reason healthcare is so fucked up to begin with in the US is because of Unions back in the 1970s, which were largely Commie organizations at that time. 

So basically this is all out of the leftist playbook. Use leftist tactics to fuck something up badly, then propose government as the solution.
There are two answers: 
1. SNOW is a cloud based business software. It hooks people with a free version then charges to unlock more advanced software. SNOW’s value to other companies is its ability to analyze organize and evaluate a company’s data and give them a path to productivity and profitability gains. The business retention rate is 150%, revenue growth is 170%, and the profit margin is 56% of revenue. 

2. Or: SNOW is a bubble and doesn’t have any classic way of valuing the company and is therefore overpriced. 

I think SNOW is 1 not 2

Black Rock hold actual assets which could be a liability to the company. Like commercial real estate. In a pandemic offices are closing everywhere. They’re also heavily invested in coal and oil assets.

I haven’t done them in years. Works until it doesn’t.
What is BI sector?
14% is great, you dont need options at all. 

If you want them, here's how they work.

Call: let's say it's a call on AAPL. A call is literally the right to buy 100 shares of apple at the "strike price." So if your strike price is 100, and the stock goes to 150, you made out real good. If your strike is 100 but it fucks around at 100, 105, 110, back to 105, 100, you'll see yourself lose money quickly. The further out the strike price is, the cheaper. Also. The sooner the option expires, the cheaper. 

Long story short, buy options with 1+ year til expiry or be sure as fuck about where your stock is going. Still buy mostly shares tho. Options are like bonus bets, you're not supposed to invest in them exclusively.
Personally I’m fine with a lot of the programs. But one should be able to opt out of paying into social security. Just a scam of a program.

bc vaccine now threatens to solve the problem for the rich people in that they can begin to reopen fully, while the poor people are likely still trying to / delayed in getting employment. Thus, the wealth is much less threatened (so the dems and GOP are both much less motivated to dealmake) and now the Dems are trying to pass something to just give some poorer folks menial relief, while the GOP is amenable to it bc maybe it will help small businesses a bit / larger businesses return to normal faster of more money is in more hands.

Dems clearly lost the negotiations. They were gaslight by the media and polls saying dems will win house & senate.
I know this isn’t the right sub for advice but anyway, I don’t get why you would sell covered calls. Surely you buy shares because you think the price is gonna rise but then you bet against them by selling calls? This also risks you losing the shares if the option is exercised?

Can you explain one more thing please. Let’s say I bought 20c PLTR at 1/15/21 and the price reached 25, do I have add more money to buy it? Or do I just get the difference? And what does the premium add? Do you get more money if you increase the premium paid?
Don’t think it was faked, Tesla leaps pricing is off because when it split it doesn’t split the historical transaction prices so it’s showing the pricing of a strike that was 1/5th. So a $50 strike post split would show the pricing of the much more expensive $10 strike.
BEcause Dems don’t care about people any more than Reps when it comes to weighing peoples welfare against their own power. 

They turned it down because they knew Biden was leading the election and they didn’t want to give trump a political “win” before the election. The more miserable people were the less likely they would be to vote for trump.

Gonna have 1k in my account by the end of the year. Started with $50. At $230. Let's gooooooooo!
We’ll say your contract is for a $10 call. Stock is at $111 day of expiry. Potentially your contract could be worth at least $101 dollars or maybe 100.99 and even though it may not seem much when you’re buying thousands of shares it adds up. So basically big investors will to save money anywhere so they pay that much for the contract even if it’s almost as much as the current stock price

I think this year is when people are starting to realize that it's all a bunch of bullshit. "The market is not the economy" is hilarious to me- because when it was created, it was supposed to be a reflection of it. Abraham Lincoln was opposed to the creation of a privatized central banking system (Fed) because it would lead to "unnatural rises in asset prices and make the market prone to crashes and crises." JFK was opposed to the Fed and was assassinated. It's a very obvious ponzi that is perpetuated by talking heads who have to make up terms to confuse the masses and use excuses like things being "forward looking." We were told that the market would get "a pass" in Q2 because of COVID, which was reason for the initial rise. Then it kept going, so the reasoning became "vaccine optimism." At the end of the day, market is supposed to be the value of a company. You're telling me Live Nation is worth as much as it was 10 months ago, despite not holding a single event since then? It's all a farce.
hahahaha. I already have the 40p 12/11 and was going to add to my position in PLTR...I MEAN SHEEEEEETTTT NEO, crap NIO. ;)

You have to have options trading allowed on your brokerage account first. Then you “Sell to open” a contract at your desired strike point and expiration date. Make sure you have enough stock to cover whatever options you are selling. 1 contract = 100 shares. Selling “naked” calls is when you sell the contract without the underlying stock to cover. Probably the most dangerous thing you can do in options since the potential loss is technically unlimited.
Nothing's free. You can god damn be assured that if everyone was getting $2000 a month from the government you're going to pay for that shit in the future.
And what Eman is maxing that out?

Options are contracts that allow but don't require the buyer to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a pre-set price. Calls mean you want it to go up, puts mean down.

If I buy a $100 call for ABC and it expires next friday, I need it to surpass $100 by friday to start making money. $100 is called the strike price. And friday is the expiration.

But I also had to pay to get the option. If I paid $1 per share for the option, I'd have paid $100 for the option. $1 is the premium. So I really need the stock price to reach $101 to break even, this is the break even price.

On Friday, if the stock price is less than $100 my option is worthless. But if it's worth more than $101, all gains that day are multiplied by 100x. Because on friday I can still by 100 shares for $100 each. If the stock is now worth $110, I can immediately sell them for $1000. I paid $100 at the start so I get $900 profit.

Rather than owning 1 stock in the company indefinitely, I can take on more risk, to maximize my reward. I only control these 100 stocks for a limited time, but I control way more than I could have for the same price by buying stocks.

Edit: this is just a basic explanation. There are plenty of nuanced concepts involved. And while I have a decent grasp of what options are in a basic sense, im by no means an effort. I'm basically retarded, im down 90% this year 😤.

I recommend [this guy](https://youtu.be/SD7sw0bf1ms) on YouTube. He has a good explanation of what options are, how to trade them on robinhood and TD Ameritrade.

He also has videos explaining what "the greeks" are which are Greek letters that represent variables in options trading.

He also has videos explaining what "spreads" are. Which let you take on less risk for less reward, or more risk for more reward.

And just remember no matter what anyone here says, it can almost always go tits up.

You’re the smart one bud. Buying stocks and forgetting about them is the true way to go when it comes to investing. Try dipping your feet into other avenues of investing like real estate and you’re start to become a mogul!

Biden doesn't care about weed and won't touch it. If Democrats win the Senate, they MIGHT pass the MORE Act. But that's a legit gamble. You'd only need one Democrat to flip (Manchin) and it'll fail.


That being said, those calls are like $0.20, so it might be worth the gamble regardless.

As someone who works in the BI sector, PLTR is a good meme stock but a terrible actual stock.

Almost every other BI vendor out there today can do what they do - real time or near real time data aggregation from multiple raw sources.

PLTR's advantage is their existing government contracts and contacts, and their solutions arm which seems to be good.

But even with that advantage they haven't been able to turn a profit, and how long until a competitor bribes the right people to bring another product in? Be careful.
Haha nice! I’m over an hour WSB today

The only real difference between buying stock and a call option is the option has an expiration date. When you buy stock, you're betting that companies price goes up... eventually.  When you buy a call, you're betting the price goes up in a specific time period, and you make a lot more money if you're right on options.
I bet His mom was an antivaxer
I’ll sell you those calls
You know I realize there is a problem! I got to talk to you
Jkjk My wife cheated on me im just trying to get some 🐱 and feel better about it lol
Hey man, liberals are the ones who pass wealth distribution programs. Ie Obamacare, earned income credit, child tax credit etc. those smart enough enough to take advantage are just doing there dd.

I missed the interview for my dream job.

I networked, studied, and practiced for weeks to prepare.

I left on time the day of the interview.

On my way to the interview, I saw a stray dog on the side of the street.

I pulled over and spent the rest of the day taking care of the dog. I fed it, gave it water, and took it to a local shelter who arranged for it to be adopted by a loving family.

The next day, I called the company and asked if I could reschedule the interview.

"There's no need," they said, "You're already hired."

Turns out the stray dog I helped was the CEO.

The moral of the story is that I'm an amazing person at all levels. Please like and share.

Ive fucked one girl with DDs, but she was the only unattractive girl ive slept with so she doesnt count.

I had a great sexual relstionship with a C cup, but every other one has been wayyyy more full of themselves than the A cup girls, who are super generous and (historically for me at least) less likely to play games.

Im programmed now to pursue highly attractive A cups over the others now cause i know the emotional return and generosity is way higher.

Its like C cups are high premiums and low returns, but A cups be those Nio calls before WSB caught on.
Thays actually great advice. I like your style haha. Not even trying to be serious with her. Shits unreal. This has been happening online all over the place too but this is the first time I've seen it irl lately. Other then i own a business and the customers have all fucking snapped too so it makes perfect sense
No you really don't know options. There are way more quant analysis involve. There are infinite number of strat/combo to pull out. And by the way, you can edge and modify your risk and premium by buying à further naked option ITM or simply with a longer DTE.
Like this:

This...never seen a sustained hype stock like this ever so I don't fuck with it
TSLA
Somebody sold him that contract, hoping it would expire worthless. In that case, that somebody would have have made a profit: he would have just kept the premium the guy paid for the contract.

It looks like this isn't going to happen. That guy holds a bunch of contracts allowing him to force that someone to sell him Tesla stock for (e.g.) $500 a piece. But Tesla stock is worth $600 dollars - so if the option expires/executes, that someone has to sell him Tesla at a $100 loss per stock. 

This is where the money is coming from.
i wish i could join y'all while we keep going up, but im retarded so im gonna keep averaging down on bearish positions.
Solo 12/18 calls high volume? Is that a bull trap or nah

Up 18% to 6 hrs 37 minutes here

You collect the premium as soon as you sell the contract

You may be right bro, haters gonna hate
It comes from whoever sold all of those options to him. If I’m thinking of the same Tesla guy I think he had like 20 call contracts? So he will be owed 20x100 stocks of Tesla upon expiration. Or it comes from other people wanting to buy those calls off of him for very high premium because they are guaranteed in the money
Sigh...
Yeah see the second part is the part I don’t get. Surely the higher price of Tesla is compensated by the higher price of the option? Or am I seeing this wrong and is the rich asshole in fact making profit if he buys and immediately exercices the option. If this is the case then wouldn’t this be free money?
I fucked up last week now I can’t afford to pay rent this month. Had to ask my dad for bail out money for the first time in my life and I’m so ashamed. I need to assemble a Hail Mary parlay to pay him back, you know, the uncut gems special.

The point is innovation helps profit. It aligns corporate incentives with public good more efficiently than other systems. That is one of the benefits of capitalism. 

And yes, the fact that I have not bought headphones in years with wires absolutely is innovation. The fact I have access to any song I want wherever I want is innovation. 

You must be too young to remember the days of walking around with foam ear covers, wired headphones, and one cd in a portable disc man the size of 3 iPhones that skipped if you ran.

Because I feel like it makes sense to sell the highest strike I think is probable to expire worthless if the assign risk doesn't bother me. If it goes below 40, that's the only real downside, but I think that's unlikely.
ELI5: how does a company like Snowflake have a larger market cap compared to a company like BlackRock?  Snowflake make zero profits and only has about $700M in revenue.  Meanwhile, BlackRock holds assets worth $8 trillion.  Why does BlackRock's market cap not more closely match the value of the assets it holds?

If it expires and you did nothing with it, it is worthless. 

If it’s say day of expiry dude can either:
1. Exercise his option meaning purchase stock 1 at price x and can immediately sell it for price Y which is a lot more than what he would exercise for. 
2. He can sell the contracts to some rich asshole who will pay him a million for his contract because the price of Tesla is that much higher than the stock price in the contract is.

All an option is is a contract to buy or sell a stock to or from someone else at a set price on a set date.  The stock price at that date determines who makes money.

Every day the stock price changes and the value of the option contract changes based on likelihood of hitting that price.

That’s simplified enough I think.

The stock market is not forward looking whatsoever, it’s a bunch of retards throwing money at whatever they think will be profitable on a day-to-day basis 

If the market was forward looking why does it moon on premarket vaccine/stimulus news that it got 15 minutes beforehand. If the market was forward looking why did it crash in March and not January?

The market doesn’t think. It doesn’t look. It does not have sentience. A stock does not “want” to move anywhere. It’s a bunch of monkeys heaving money into it and hopefully taking out more than they brought. Some people participating in the market sometimes can predict the outcome of a gamble accurately, and that’s all.

I probably wouldn't under most circumstances.

I'm 34. If I magically dumbassed my way to like $10 million I'd still want to fill my days with productive work I can be proud of. I like my job, the people I work with, and feel accomplished most of the time. I don't want to leave that behind.

My wife would probably take some time away from her job, but she's also happy with her work. We have kids so it would be silly to  have that much money and have them in daycare when a parent could stay home with them.

I guess there are other ways to feel accomplished without subscribing to the 8-5 life, but I don't want to coast at this point in my life.
Nah

Yeah. Exactly right. Monday is going to be very interesting. I expect a gigantic afternoon like we saw EOW last week but bigger.

Court hears case on Wednesday so a deal to avoid that will be announced Tuesday if there's a deal. The treasury and Trump admin knows the court is gunna rule against the gov and in favor of the shareholders. Most conservative court ever.

Anyways, Monday am may be last time we see this thing at $2 or even $3. Announcement puts it at $5 and NYSE listing in 6 months puts it at $10 easily. Some people following this online are projecting $20 share price given how big the company is.

Here is a list of companies that it exceeds in revenues:

1. Bank of America
2. Home Depot
3. Wells Fargo
4. Citigroup
5. Johnson and Johnson
6. Raytheon 
7. Boeing
8. Target
9. General Electric
10. Dell Technologies 

And you wanna tell him this stock should be at $2.50, lol. This thing is gunna popppppppp tendies...

60/40 or 70/30 cash vs invested the past few years. Have missed out a bit but I'd been waiting for a correction and Covid seemed to be the pin for the balloon. Turned $65k into $350k in March shorting then lost all of it because my fair value S&P was $1,800 and was waiting for the dominos to fall. I'm a big fundamentals guy and I got bent over by Jerome and the Fed. I've been playing the rise but still have 60% cash because the fundamentals are even worse than before...right now especially we're on a knife's edge, starting to open short positions again with my 40%.

AIRBNB IPO this week, Dec. 10th @ $44-50

Going to dump $30k into that shit see you at $100
On the one hand, having the stock market close on the weekend is really good

I get to take a break and dont have to check my phone every 3 seconds wondering if ill be sucking dick for coke because i lost my entire lifes savings betting on a meme

On the other hand, its like a dealer that doesnt answer on the weekend. Like im desperate for my fix and theres a couple asian plugs that work onnthe weekend but their ahit is cut with meth and baby laxatives, and i always get diarrhea doin their shit
If you’re addicted to porn there’s arguably benefit to cutting down if that’s something you want to do and using NNN as a starting point.

Whole lot of responses to sift through, but I promise I will check each one and stay true to my word. 
!remind me 6/4/20
For example take the guy whose TSLA options are currently worth nearly 1 mill. How does that option turn into one mill cash upon expiration? I get everything about exercising an option, but can’t see how it can make you money if it expires.

Sadly, this dream is fake.  Without going into "how did he acquire calls of $TSLA at $0.23", I just consulted photoshop, and an answer was revealed to me.  If this was truly a screenshot, from his phone, without getting re-compressed (uploaded/downloaded) more than once, then the kerning should be perfectly consistent.

Alas, it is not.  The spacing between the decimal and the 2 on "$0.23" is different than the spacing in "$136.23" - he probably used paint to make a copy of the "23" number from the TSLA break even price and put it under avg cost, but he put it one pixel to the right from where it should be.  NOTE - this effect can NOT be due to compression.  Compression could shrink/enlarge the numbers appearance from their sub-pixels, but it cannot entirely shift a full arrangement of pixels to the right or left.  Additionally, the image is suspiciously crisp to even suggest it's gone through compression/decompression.

Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL](https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL) \- The $0.23 is dragged above the $136.23, aligning decimal points.  Space between decimal point and number 2 is only 5 pixels for "0.23" but its 6 pixels for "136.23"

Alternate proof: [https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG](https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG) The .23 from avg price was given 50% opacity, colored red, dragged over location to align decimals.  The break even price was colored blue. You can see decimal is perfectly purple, but the numbers of a layer of red on the left and a layer of blue on the right.

Edit - Apparently imgur compressed. So heres a screenshot of it open in gimp for higher resolution [https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k](https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k)

TLDR - The image you're seeing can only be made through repeated compression/decompression, or photoshop. Likely the latter.

#The image he linked for his All timeline is missing percentages and start date. You can also see the edits he made if you look closely enough with low brightness. Fake.

They didn’t measure productivity improvements. In 1929 companies had assembly lines with manual labor. They didn’t have hourly inventory or overnight deliveries. Its like comparing the cost of a crop of potatoes in 1929 to a modern farm today.

You also didn’t mention the fact that you can trade the options contract.
Technically you probably should’ve been receiving k1s over the years (assuming this is llc/s Corp). Therefore I’m surprised the irs didn’t catch the gap in reported shareholders (ownership not equaling 100%). The distribution is one part of it, but you’d be on the hook possibly for years of under reporting. 

I’d shift the burden back to them claiming you had no knowledge of this scheme.
Have 3k in the account currently, daydreaming of my OTM calls hitting 12k. Already dreaming that 12k isnt enough and i'd yolo again hoping for 25k... Then yolo again... What kinda shitty ass daydreaming is my brain doing homies. Obv 12k would be enough to just withdrawal, lmao

roughly 33% in the bank and 66% investing right now. my goal is to one day have enough that i only need to keep 4% in the bank to cover my bills, the other 96% investing. thats the golden ratio for generational wealth.

Ahhh. I’m a cog in a machine at my job. What’s nice about realizing that is I won’t stay at the same company for 30 years like my parents generation. You bet your ass I’ll shop around for the best salary
American Options, yes.
European Options, no.

Also, usually it’s preferable to sell the options to exercising it because there is always some “time-value” for the option.

Let’s say the stock price is $40 and the strike price is $20. If you exercise you would get $20/share.

However if you sold, you would get more than $20/share.

He hasn't made any money until he pulls it out.  Until then it might as well be imaginary
Don't listen to these idiots trying to "explain" things. Those are just "facts". You don't need "facts". Just *feel the market*. All you need to know is C stands for Zoomies and P stands for Poopies. You buy Cs when things are zooming and you buy Ps when everything's going to shit. When there's a number there, that's to show how much money you're going to make when you're right. The date is when you want to get that money. 

Example: 12/10 SPY 420c means you've bought a Zoomie on SPY that's going to pay you a lot on 12/10 'cause the number is so big. Vs 12/10 SPY 200p means you've thrown your money away on SPY Poopies and on 12/10 you're not going to have shit because the number is so small and it's also a retarded play. 

You are now ready to get approved for level 4 options. Get out there and have fun!
The one thing I don’t get about options is where the money comes from in case it expires
Holy shit why

Yeah sure. Did he have square pants too?
Calls are uppies and puts are downies retard
Overwhelmingly bullish market = low IV.

Calls go down in price with lower IV because short sellers typically use calls during bear markets to protect their short stock positions.... at latest thats what I've always thought. Thats the only explanation I can think of for why IV affects calls the same way it affects puts

Meh, only about $5-10k....mostly for emergencies.  Push comes to shove, I can put more on a credit card and pay it off all at once.  Most of my wealth is invested. I hate holding cash.  After inflation, and an interest rate of .00000001% that you get these days from banks and bonds, you lose money holding a lot of cash.  Even high yield savings accounts have shitty interest rates.   

If I hit an extreme emergency, I can always pull cash out of a roth ira penalty free.  After that I can liquidate all of my brokeage account for more money.  If all of that is wiped I can take loans from my 401k that I pay interest on towards myself anyway as a last resort in a doomsday scenario.  

I hate lots of cash. 75% of my paychecks go into investing after all bills are paid.
Hopefully your grandparents don’t die and leave you inheriting their debts.

So my grandparents used all their grandchildren in a questionable tax shelter scheme for my entire life by giving us all stock in their company, but not actually paying out distributions, therefore cutting their tax burden by 20%. Now the company is dissolving, and supposedly I am going to get a final distribution which should barely cover my tax losses over the years, but I'm mostly just pissed knowing that I have to wait until the end of the year or later and can't put it to work now.
You get that $8 joint. I'm an effing Champion.

When Warner Bros made their announcement that they would be releasing all of their movies on HBO Max for 2021, I thought I would “cash in on these option thingies”. I knew I wouldn’t be the only one thinking this but I figured I could get at least a little bit of the pot. 

So I researched calls/puts until I fully understood what they meant and how they worked...

You guys are some real retards! The amount of risk combined with the premiums are absurd. You truly have to “win the lottery” in order to see substantial gains that don’t leave taking more and more risks that could drain your reserves.

Hahahah. The fomo is strong
>Some guy said it'll only cost 25 billion so it must be true!

>is there something I'm missing?

Lol yes.  The federal government spends 3 times this amount on food programs annually and roughly 80 times that amount on an assortment of programs for the poor. These sort of quixotic, millenarian visions of the future almost always cost much more than their proponents suggest they would. He seems to be suggesting that  "raising the purchasing power of the food insecure by 26 billion" alone would fix the problem, but administrative costs alone would probably double this guy's estimate. 

Sides, I think it's healthy to be skeptical that some guy with a poly sci degree would have the answer to "solving hunger" and saving the federal government billions of dollars in outlays. Even if he were an economist with a focus on agriculture, these claims should be met with skepticism.
Lets say a stimmy passes and there are no checks and it all goes to big companies. would QQQ 3 months out 5% otm be the play or is there anything mor specific that might work better
Why
Get in early, then sell.  Most ipo pop and then drop to below ipo price before starting a steady climb.  Look at RKT.
PLTR was a direct offering - so different.  Stock already existed privately and is now able to be sold.

4) Consider prostitution as an OPTION.
That’s my strategy. And buy them leaps continuously on the way down.
Well im poor so i was gonna buy a few 700/750 12/31s. Maybe 750/800. These were 800-1k or so on friday , max profit be 5k minus the cost. Then ive been holding some shares.

#You guys are STILL all fucking retarded for believing this isn't edited. 

**If you guys haven't been around long enough to know the lengths people go to lie and LARP on here, you haven't been around long enough.**

Other people have pointed out fishy shit on the options chain. First of all, Tesla LEAPs for fucking twenty cents? **Yeah, strike one.**

The biggest one? https://imgur.com/a/ZUtVmBD Look at the OP's "All Time" screenshot on Imgur. TURN YOUR BRIGHTNESS ALL THE WAY UP.

**YOU CAN SEE A TEXT BOX DISCOLORATION WHERE THE ALL-TIME IS EDITED. YOU RETARDS.**

**STOP FALLING FOR THIS SHIT**

Also, here's my previous comment on why you guys are absolutely retarded for falling for this. More evidence:

---

So, so far, for evidence that this is **absolute bullshit** and you guys are all retarded for falling for shit like this all the time, is:

- The image he linked for his All timeline is missing percentages and start date. You can also see the edits he made if you look closely enough with low brightness. Fake.

**And also:**

- The $136 contracts didn't exist until September 2020. But even if you pick a similar contract that did exist such as the 15Jan21 120C they only went from $20(if bought at the bottom in 2019, split adjusted) to $500, which is a 25x return(2500%).

[He's the chart for the 140C(700 pre-split)](https://i.imgur.com/LYnMv2n.png)

[He's the chart for his imaginary 136C, they didnt even exist until September](https://imgur.com/ogsJ6PZ)

**To which OP Replied (and got downvoted for being exposed):**

**"That is because this when the stock split. A $680 call becomes 5 $136 calls on a 5 to 1 split that happened... you guessed it... in September 2020."**

**Nope.** Contracts don't stop existing after split, they split just like the stock...again you show you're a lying fgt...also split was in august not that it matters. And as I said, the numbers I gave you are split adjusted already.

Nice larping though fgt

mods plz ban this fucker.

so in new to this subreddit and I got here by joining this random discord and every morning they got like 10 people talking about what options to buy and graphs n shit. But why are they unifying what benefits do they get buying stuff together can they manipulate the market?

I don't have a dog in this fight, with the closest position I have is an order for some calls in MRVL after their dip this week.   But the question posed was why are people hating on them.  They've botched two quarters, and this quarter they wouldn't take questions during the conference call from the analysts that grilled them the prior one.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-23/intel-dodges-wall-street-critics-on-another-tough-earnings-call](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-23/intel-dodges-wall-street-critics-on-another-tough-earnings-call)

Two key graphs:

*The world’s largest chipmaker is at the center of a debate about its future, one that its detractors are winning. They argue that multiyear delays in introducing new manufacturing technology has cost Intel its main competitive advantage and rivals are going to thrive at its expense.*

and,

*“While we thought last quarter’s call was bad, last night’s was potentially even worse as fundamentals are now deteriorating at an alarming pace,” he wrote. “Frankly, while CEO Bob Swan suggested 2020 has been the most challenging year in his career, we have to believe that 2021 is going to be worse.”*

I think you can add to it that Swan wasn't the first, second, or third pick for CEO and Intel had to basically settle for him after a year long + search for a new CEO.  There's just not any confidence that the company can keep up right now.

This is why there are markets.  If you're right, there's money to be made here when they get things squared away and return to form.  If the analysts are right, Intel becomes a next tier commodity producer in an industry that only values innovation.

Also, congrats to OP for seeing value when most were bailing.
What are “Oct” calls? Are you calling the 12/11 calls as Oct?

Ive been thinking about this a lot lately.

Of course "the big crash" everyone talks about being on the horizon could happen like 100 years ago..

But how many 401ks were there in 1920? We have  a hige amount of money pouring in every week from that alone, international exposure thanks to globalization, and my main man JPOW backing up the market no matter what.

Also while retail traders obv arent as big of a deal as MM, how much does retail fuck with MM algos which cause a kind of self fulfilling prophecy?

Idk, im pretty dumb so maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, but if a global pandemic crash can recover in a few months, I don't know how we could actually crash anymore.

They will absolutely pull every dime of profit they made this year when January hits; they're gonna roll their taxes to 2021 and pull the rug so fucking hard, IMO
So this is the fucked up part, I live in Canada and I feel like this is exactly what the gov is trying to do. They either lockdown and fuck the economy to save a bunch of people that will likely die in 10 to 15 years anyway and be a drain on social services OR they let them die and save the economy... 

Which seems like the most logical solution in a country where one of the biggest healthcare nightmares we've been discussing for years is the financial burden the boomers will be on our universal healthcare... Fucked but true

Then you should split your current position in half, invest one half in memes, and invest the other half in literally anything else. Maybe buy some boomer stock to sit on... or Maybe brakes for your car? Maybe a dentist visit you've been avoiding. Something terribly boring yet expensive, that you have neglected. Or an investment more "stable" than the memes.

Absolutely. The weak and old are dying, AKA, burdens. We should benefit greatly from their deaths, part of the reason why I’m against all lockdowns/mitigation efforts by the government. They throw around 2 million deaths like that’s supposed to make me want to lockdown, wrong. Makes me want to go out and socialize with some fat welfare queens.
If you think a better thing will happen but it’s more likely a reverse thing will happen
yeah I took a little hit. Glad I rolled my 12/4 to 12/11. They might rally with the rest of 5G this week. I may recoup the 600 (net 300) I lost Friday.  I bought the dip in leaps.

Leverage...500 in stock is just that...stock. However, 500 in options contracts is 100 shares per contracts... so depending on what you bought at. You can control 50k worth of stock with 500. More control = more money to be made and lost. This person was on the lucky side of the coin.

I was In at 4 at June, loaded more at 5, if I can free up some cash this week I'll likely add more. It was one of S and PS worst performers last year, they went through 5 CEOs, it was a risky play until they hired the current CEO, cleaned up their balance sheet, became more innovative with their online presence. Before the pandemic they were in rough shape and were trading around 13$

What are the moves for this week? Need some tendies.
[deleted]
**The guy who owns the stock is selling the contract**, so they collect the premium from the buyer of the calls/puts (the premium can be a lot of money if the volatility of the stock is high). They get this premium immediately no matter what happens to the stock price.

If you buy calls or puts and they expire worthless, your max loss is the premium that you originally paid (the person you bought the contract from gets this). They get your money. (whether they profit or not depends on where they stock price goes and if they own it. There's a chance they can lose money if they're selling covered calls and the stock price goes down, but in the end selling those calls is downside protection)
Because it's had a massive run-up already

Here's the issue, I think the old way of thinking is dead. The market has always been irrational but I think it's truly gone off the deep end, but it's literally too big to fail. The market is a major reservoir for retirement savings and overall wealth, it can't afford to plummet indefinitely. That's not to say a flash crash can't happen if there's an extreme shock but it's basically, get the fuck in the market or inflation is gonna leave you behind.

TLDR; Stonks only go up.

Yeah, I’ll take the most talented/capable team but thanks anyway.
You say that like it’s over
Which will do better in 2021:

#RKT or PTON ?
would you sell just prior to earnings even if you thought the earnings would be good news and the stock would go up?
With IV so high your best bet would be to buy a vertical call. I’m looking into this myself now. Buy a jan 2022 45c and sell an 80c. The trade costs $668 with a max gain of $2,800. If it’s above $80 at expiration you’d be looking at a 420% gain. 

I would be looking to back the 80c if IV comes down or when it gets closer expiration.

The simplest way to describe options: You pay extra money, to make a riskier play, with more specific timing, that loses value as it gets closer to the expiration date. It's probably good you don't really know what it is, because it's the only real way you can lose money on stocks even if they go up. That said, options is also how you risk money to get huge returns. If you don't even know what options are, just don't do it. Learn everything you can before you dive in to lose your first 1000.
This is the way!  Now show us that loss porn baby!

JPM 110p 12/31 would be a solid bet. The big reason banks have gone up so much is because of yields rising and vaccine news, coming up this week is the earliest that the FDA can approve a vaccine if it doesn't get approved we'd likely see bank stocks dip abit.
No doubt in my mind gonna rip hard tomorrow after the Cramer pump and merger vote. Could hit $25-$30 this week easy.

I deleted the part about the profit bc it doesn’t matter much IMO.

hmm good point. should i delete post?
I trade on intuition mostly. There’s nothing for me to “research,” about AAPL, C, BABA, NVDA, etc... they’re good companies and when they drop below a certain amount, I buy them, and when they go up, I sell them.

Yep all you needed to do to retire with over 10 million dollars is spend $5k on certain TSLA calls in 2019 and wait a year

10 million before the government robs you for being in the highest tax bracket ofc
But that doesn’t really answer your theory that analysts are conspiring to keep price down because PLTR didn’t use IB’s in their IPO

Can you find a case where this has happened in the past?

Look at how much $TSLA has gone up over the past year and a half. He bought some impossibly OTM YOLO options and then TSLA did what no bulls even expected could happen so quickly.

Yeah I will :) but Google was giving me gibberish! Once the other dude mentioned strike price etc. I did as you advised.
call gives you the option to buy 100 shares at the strike price before expiration, put gives you the option to sell 100 shares at the strike price before expiration.

Money doesn’t = happiness.
You're in WSB and you're asking why retards do retarded things. Just last week we saw meme overload because so many people here lost shittons of money by gambling on weekly PLTR calls.

People here aren't investing. They're gambling. Weeklies are cheaper up front cost than LEAPS. They're gambling that it does shoot up by then and they'll be able to make a ton of money. But it's all a gamble.
How many hours do you retards put into actual research? I have about 50 stocks and 50 options to keep track of, on top of looking into every companies filings/trades/charts and just plain news. 2-4 hrs on a trading day. ~2hrs after closing. I dont trade AH....but i do this with a full time job...

Not saying the TSLA post isn't fake, but here's [proof](https://i.imgur.com/MCdmpj5.png) for you tards that don't believe that TSLA 01/15/2021 calls were trading that low. Yes that's $680 strike because assuming it's not fake that's what the original poster bought because they were purchased before the split happened. $680 strike divided by 5 is his weird $136 strike

Tastyworks does not adjust the price for the split, it states what it was traded at on that exact date so you need to divide the price of the option by 5 as well. You also see a massive difference in the option's price when the split happened and I showed where it was by using a red line.

I found the lowest price I could which was like 30% less than what OP bought them for. $0.23 x 5 = $1.15 premium. They were definitely trading below $1.15 for quite a while. Notice that massive window to buy and all we had to do was hold. $500 into almost a million

^(ok end of rant, i'll fuck off)

edit: 0 balance because it's my GF's new empty account
He bought options on TSLA. He didn’t buy the stock. He bought the right to buy the stock. 1 contract = 100 shares, and he bought 20 contracts. He bought them a long time ago with a strike price that it was so far out that the contract only cost 23 cents. I.e whoever is on the other side of that trade thought ‘this is so unlikely to happen, I’m happy to just take 23 cents for doing nothing’.
Piece of cake with options. YOLO the wrong way on earnings is an easy way to do it.
Let's be clear. Yoy always get to keep the premium no matter what. The question is whether you have to sell your shares or not.
Bitches don't know about redemption.
It would be more profitable if you were right.  You lever your portfolio like this and then a sustained down trend like 08 would murder you.  Who knows if we will ever see such a trend again with the fed doing what they are doing though.
And on the next episode: Loss porn, regrets, frustration, and permanent retirement from trading. “Buy and hold strategy only from now on” you’ll say...”No more meme stocks”...But we all know that’s a lie....

I listen to him just about everyday and not the edited YouTube videos. Sounds like you watch the msm edited rant videos by Alex. He’s actually a lot more logical and rational than you think if you give the entire show a chance. He goes over the top with his rants for sure but his predictions are accurate. He already predicted that the democrats would steal the election as well a couple of years ago and it’s true.
A guy I knew from back in high school recently made a very similar post on Facebook, but for a $4K gain. It seriously made me wonder if this is the end. This is the kind of idiocy you saw at the top of the dot com bubble back in 1999. Everyone was a trading genius.

Spooked by 7B in a 40T or whatever market

Basically, it’s like this. He bought 1 contract that gives him the right to purchase (a call) 100 shares of PLTR at 20 dollars (strike price) a share by 1/15/21 (expiration). If the price of PLTR is 20 dollars or above, he is IN THE MONEY and if the contracts expires while the price remains at or above his strike price, he profits. If the price of PLTR is below 20, he is OUT OF THE MONEY and remains below 20 at his expiration, the contract will expire worthless and he will lose whatever money he paid for that contract. That is the basics of a call contract. 

Now there are other factors to consider, such as the amount of money he paid for the contract which is called the premium. The premium is comprised of two factors called the intrinsic value and the extrinsic value, but that gets a little bit more complicated. Just know that he has paid a premium for that contract and he will need to clear that premium at expiration to make a profit. So if he paid a 1 dollar premium on that contract (1 x 100 shares = 100 dollars) he will need PLTR to be above 21 dollars to be profitable.

Edit: Just a retard helping fellow retards be a little bit less retarded. I had no idea this comment would blow up. I’m trying to answer as many questions as I can while at work.

Just type your income online. Taxes is just copy and paste
It's very simple and most people explain it absolutely retardedly.

I'm not going to explain puts because they're magic (yes I know how they work but I'm drunk and don't care to explain them)

When someone creates/sells a **Call** Contract, they are saying "I will be obligated to sell the buyer of this **Call** Contract 100 shares of this stock at the strike price by the expiration date" (assuming the stock reaches the Strike price by the expiration date). They also collect a premium for selling this contract

When you buy a **Call** Contract, you are given the right to buy 100 shares of this stock at the strike price **from** the contract writer when you exercise the contract (assuming the stock reaches the Strike Price at all).

"1 20c 1/15/21 PLTR"

1 contract

20 strike Call (c) Contract

1/15/21 expiration

PLTR stock

This contract can be exercised because PLTR is above the Strike price and the buyer can purchase 100 shares from the seller for $20 per share (PLTR is currently above $20 per share and so the buyer of the contract will make a profit on this trade).

A lot of the time these contracts aren't exercised though, because you can resell the contract for money. Exercising the option would mean owning PLTR at $20 per share which you may not want to do.

The writer/seller of the contract is a chad no matter what because they collect the premium that you pay when you buy the contract and most likely owned PLTR before it was $20, so collected the difference between their average price and $20 as well.
I still think Spider-Man is the only reason to buy a PS5
SPY 200P
God, Brexit talks are apparently still going on.  How long does it take to negotiate an exit?
I'm in the same boat. I just started looking it up. So when you but a call, you are paying someone who has the stock you are interested in to guarantee a purchase price (strike price) for you at a later date. If the stock guess up, you can buy the stock for the strike price agreed upon. If the stock guess down, you are only out the money you paid them (that's called the premium). 

Puts are where you are paid a premium and agree to buy the stock at an agreed upon price (strike price) on a certain date. So if the stock guess down below the strike price you have to buy it for more than it is currently worth. If the stock is above the strike price on that date, nothing happens and you get to keep the premium that was paid to you.

Calls and puts are known as "options"
Have calls but what makes you confident

22% in circulation, not inflation. Inflation will probably be closer to 3-4% for 2021 and then who knows from there. So whatever percent you’re up, deduct 4% vs historically around 2%. You just hope it’s not a hyper-inflation scenario in a couple of years. Google ‘hyper/inflation Venezuela’ to see what happened there a couple of years ago...
Closing out everything except my losers (2021 tax strategy lel) and opening up a mid term bearish hedge once we clear 370. But I want, like, a spicy hedge. An spy 300p is boring.

I've tried digging into it too. It was trading just under $200 last June which makes the cheap leaps questionable. The price is plausible for a boring stock flat stock, but not one as volatile at Tesla.

I went to a mini super spreader event last night with my friends. It was a pretty fancy affair too with fondue(both chocolate AND cheese) and wine decanters and a raclette which something you degenerate monkeys probably have never heard of. Anyway I made a bunch of jokes about covid and then I overheard the cute girl I was working on mention her dad died of it earlier this year. So I probably fucked up that opportunity!

Feel like there have been no surprises on this. Unlike spring/summer/fall, people tend to stay inside more often anyway. The economic losses from COVID are far less.

Plus we've seen this song and dance before. Markets are factoring it all in more. Look at vaccine news pumps through November. The Pfizer vaccine news had Dow opening up nearly 2000. Following events were less.

Things that are bearish are all the same and we've been seeing them all year. The summer spike was not anticipated and caused more selling. This winter spike has been advertised for a while.

Also, who the fuck knows really. I sure don't. I just don't get paid nearly as much as the boneheads on CNBC to know nothing.

Your calls are fine.

i looked into it and maybe it is fake but those calls were really trading for less than what he paid for it 1-2 years ago, so it definitely could have been done

i also found NIO calls that were trading at $0.03 premium in 2018 and they recently were trading over $40.00 premium, in other words $3 into over $4,000 each call
Just ignore them, very low chance anything will happen

I get the same feeling, I think, right before I have to get blood drawn. It this weird exhilarating nervousness, as I’m sitting there waiting, watching the phlebotomist as she expertly moves around the room. 


My arm, laid out on the arm rest, hand clenched as she probes the crook of my elbow for just the right spot. With light but firm pressure she makes sure she knows her target. 


“Just a small pinch...” she says softly, as she steadies the needle.


I draw in a small shallow breathe as I feel the tip of the needle against my skin. My body begins to feel flush, the hairs on my arm and back of my neck stand up. My eyes ,wide open, are locked on the needle, the rest of the room seems to fade away...

Past results are not a present indicator blah blah blah but previous recent years nike underperforms December and then recovers in January.
I shoulda bought this when it was on micro ventures.
yes please

So I have about $27k in NKE calls between two accounts. I am planning on selling 1/2 on the potential run up to earnings and holding the rest of my April calls through earnings.
I’d really like a red day on Monday. I want my hedges to go itm so I can flip them for cheaper calls and shares in this 🤡 market
Bullish

Yeah but usually after they make massive gains. Specifically so the autism hurts more.

It’s an emergency approval. It won’t do miracles as it is partially priced in. The approval though would move the stock a bit. Everyone knows this is coming. Not a surprise.
Thoughts on AMZN weeklies
Naw this shit is bought up now and you guys will buy it 5 years down the road when oil is at 300 a barrel there are massive oil shortages and the stocks up 2000% since everyone was to afraid to maintain oil production due to EVs, and lack of oil expansion yet we still need it... Oil will need to cost a arm and a leg before EVs become the norm... 🤣

They don't.  Retards here turn it into losses.
I keep telling people this virus is the best thing to happen to me.  1) save money on rent 2) student loan forbearance 3) massive gains in the market.
At some point there will be no more shares outstanding to give and shorts will have to cover? The squeeze is inevitable. I’m all in 🤝
But there’s so much money & attention (money) in people thinking you’re some kind of god with investing (and somehow by association finance).

If only it wasn’t all my friends & families money I’d be losing
I’m new here and I don’t understand how 500$ of stocks can turn into a million dollars in one year. Sure, Tesla’s stocks increased in value but surely not by that much. What am I missing here?
Tax season is gonna be a mess this upcoming year for me. I’ve had 5 different jobs this year. Unemployment benefits. Started trading. Been doing my own taxes for a few years now but idk about this time lmao

Wsb Using technical analysis from 10+ years ago.

Thank god I bought puts at close
You don’t know what a short squeeze is and SNOW will absolutely not have anything close to one expect the stock to pullback heavy this week to 360 range at minimum based off charts and volume this bitch is going down
I’m not taking advice from someone yoloing in gme. Lol.  Nobody is 100% sure what’s going to happen, but it’s pretty clear gme is a garbage company and this forcing of a short squeeze strategy might be the most autistic move in all of wsb history.  There is a reason why short interest is so high.  You will need a lot of manpower to really scare the shit out of the shorts. You might get it pumped up here and there but it will almost always dump after.  It’s unreal that some of you think it’s going to $50. Lol. You think this is tesla?  Tesla has a future. Gme doesn’t. I’ve seen stupid shit happen though so why would I make a medium risk low reward sideways play on gme when there are many stocks I could put myself into at the same or lower risk with high rewards.

You keep talking about why I’m not making a play on gme if I really know all this. I’ll make a deal. Take out the biggest loan you can and all in gme, then I’ll make a sideways play in gme.  If you really know this short squeeze is going to work, you would risk everything on it. Right?
My boss uses Hargreaves Lansdown and holds onto positions for months. He’s into Jaguar, TUI and Next. IF I ever do it again I am certainly not using CFD providers.

No no... that's too neutral. 

Talk a lot about your losses. You need to appear properly fucked for the Universe to not recognize that it has an urgent need to shit on you.

You don't have to tell people, or even believe it... you just need to broadcast it.

2021 Year Of The Ox (Bull). Your kind had its opportunity from March to the fall. I hope you all got fattened up because it will be a hard bull run now that "normal" policy can dictate some semblance of predictability. Do you remember hearing "no guidance because of COVID" in ER for like half of publicly traded companies?
if that's the case my mom is gonna whoop my ass 😣
I would go with shares as a safe bet.   
There is just too much going on with BABA that can mess up your calls.

Ivy is what's going to materially add to the revenue stream here. That said,  the notable thing about QNX is that it has very recently been adding large new customers, including XPeng.
No, the funds hedge with shares on options anyway. The reason to go shares is because the exact timing and behavior of the short is impossible to predict.

Catalyst OP is mentioning is almost a nonfactor in true valuation. Only reason it pops is on the meme that this post drives.

It’s overall the same thing for CVS, but CVS in theory gets some tailwind from vaccine delivery as it has a strategic roadmap for community health via its Caremark / Minuteclinics.

Not saying you won’t make money. But the news itself and the financial implications, accounting for any additional foot traffic and sales will not be the reason.

Sep start: SPY was at 358, now 3.5 months later, it's at 367, 3.35% up. QQQ was 302 and now at 305, less than 1% in 3.5 month. So, no, sir. I am not joking at all.
When you get those responses you know you're doing something right, or are just a retard.
Meh I've been to hell and back a few times early on. Those first couple hundreds/thousands invested that were momentary lost were the most painful, but made me strong and better understand the emotions others fall victim to. 

Investing is not for everyone for some the mental strain of lossing money months on end can cause them to throw in the towel. If you can't handle loss from time to time you will never be able to achieve gains. I held through studied harder, and kept investing every extra cent I made. 

Being able to firmly price companies and maintain solid expectation. This provides the foundation to a level headed behavior. 

I am also a firm believer in buying 5-10 years forward looking. So many people lose by selling to early and only looking a day/month ahead.

Last off options are poison and often kill just like casinos. Your lying to your self if you think it's not gambling...

You retard.  The option existed back then.  And it did drop below $1 or $0.20 split adjusted.  You weren’t trading Tesla back then so of course you wouldn’t know.  Find better historical charts.

Airbnb prices seem to have exploded in my geographies based on the crawler bots I’ve thrown out, with main driver being cleaning fees. 

They’re no longer cheaper than hotels, and while this is anecdotal, I know a ton of folks who have basically delisted or blacked out dates for the time being just because of COVID hassles.
This is not a good idea. Analysts are overestimating next quarter and pricing in success, whereas last quarter they were doing the opposite. Nike traditionally has bad q3 earnings because they don't benefit from things like people wearing outside clothes in bad weather and the back-to-school rush. 

Most worrying is that fact that NKE ate hog shit in June because of supply chain issues, not sales per se. And with UPS strangling their deliveries, guidance will point to, yes, more supply chain issues.

If you hold through earnings, you are going to lose your pubes. I YOLO'd 20k on NKE and held through earnings in the fall. I posted CROX DD when it was trading around ~45. I know what I'm talking about, probably

It has all of my transactions from last summer plus video of my all time returns. I will share with mods but not every shmo who asks.

Lol 6-7k a week. I could make 500k a week buying Palantir.
The stock is fundamentally undervalued. The squeeze potential is a cherry on top.
That’s Theta Burn coupled with IV crush. It’ll go away eventually.
UK is rubber stamping at least one basically without reviewing the data at all.
Christ this did not hold up well, lol
This is very concerning to me. I mean would you rather own Apple, or the entire Australian economy... like doesn’t this scream a market out of control and touch with underlying value?
He means your 15’s likely won’t print because of IV crush. Make it a 15/13p debit spread you’ll protect yourself (partially) from decrease in vega.

As someone who works for big three we are so fucking far behind on autonomous and ev it's not even funny. 

Now let me tell you something about the big three. I work in one of the most productive auto plants in the world. We make a fuck ton of cars at very very high efficiency and low cost. We have retooled this plant before. Let's say it's about 1 million square ft facility. So that gives you an idea of the size. Once we have an ev ready to produce, it only takes 2 weeks to rip out the entire plant to a blank floor and 3 weeks to rebuild it. 

It does take a while to work production kinks out, but as soon as big three are ready to switch to ev it will be like flipping a switch for them. We already have all the logistics, shipping, receiving, parts facilities, subsidiary manufacturers, FIFO supply chains, established quality and testing methods. 

Now I think it's too early to jump in as of yet but I think a company like VW will have the capability to crush Tesla when it comes to manufacturing. 

Now Tesla can still catch up, they can win in design, they can win on sentiment and they may still very well win on technology. It's totally possible they end up getting bought out one day. 

Anyway I'm just an idiot who works in the industry so take what I said with a grain of salt.
Predicting Damian Lillard as next season's MVP is like a 5 bagger. And I think it's pretty likely that he wins
China is Hellbent on running the EV boom in Asia and Europe and they will nothing you can do about it. Tesla will dominate USA and maybe a some other countries but NIO Xpeng collaboration will win Asia and Europe for sure
Luminar CEO is the youngest self made billionaire at 25.
Enjoy your slow ride. I’m going to tendie town
My thoughts exactly
[deleted]
NIO will have a 1 trillion dollar cap in 3 years I can garuntee it. They are going to grow over twice as fast as Tesla they are already doing it. New guidances show that 150k to 200k is low end for NiO car sales next year and both them and Xpeng could likely do 500k each
He knows elon is going to part ways with the company within the next year 

People don’t buy Tesla because they love the stock, they buy Tesla for Elon

What if he leaves lol

You’re right. Doesn’t have to be now. If you’re tolerant to a bit of risk and exposure then now is fine will the IV is low. 6 months plus or Leaps would be a great option now. 
But waiting is fine too. A close above the 50ma or 270 would be confirmation
With not even 8 mln in cap this thing will moon so hard
Walgreens is better.
Most peeps around here are patau syndrome.
that was hilarious

Same bro, I just buy stuff and watch. 

Up over 500% maybe I shouldn’t learn
I'm not in it for the long run (year+ hold). I want to try and take advantage of the current situation and see if I can make a profit in the next few months before I move on.
 instituttions going to dumping there over priced stock on you retards CANT wait for all the bag holders to be crying

Vaccine has arrived in the UK and awaiting distribution. If we all survive, the rest of you will get it too. 

If we don't... well... buy shares in bodybag manufacturing.
Silly bear, puts when i arrived. Calls now post dick surgery $ME 4c 12/16
That kind of accountability will take that kid to the moon! 😂
NIO 2000 shares at 17 each Xpeng 1000 shares at 20 each. Can’t go wrong because growth is exponential and NIO is already setting up robo taxis in like a dozen countries such as Israel and Denmark. Also China loves them both and they love Chinese products, middle class is huge and will be forced to buy these cars, NIO has better batteries business model and growth than Tesla I could keep going on. NIO has clubhouses that are bigger than malls in a few a few dozen cities and the government is backing them...Litteraly can’t go anywhere except the moon homie Americans just need to stop being spooked by nothing
Don’t talk shit on PLTR

that's pretty much why I bought some puts EOD friday

i can't look at the RSI right now and convince myself it's still a good time to buy calls...idk. i'm not all in puts though or even close
This is the way.

Wtf teach me
This is the kind of input I'm looking for. I honestly don't know the answer. This kind of math has generally been very profitable for me in the past, but I don't know the sector well enough to give you a good answer on your specific questions. I'll do more research and see what I can find out.

I truly appreciate your thoughts as these are the things that I'm still weak in as an investor.
Sooo calls it is
So when is the mkment we buy up on stuff if its gauranteed to be approved

WSB bearish on TSLA = calls
Pussy.
If I knew what that meant I’d be jealous
Sure. But why get in now? Let it make a convincing close above the 50ma, survive a ret test of that, then get in with a solid stop just below the 50ma that would just have gone form being resistants to support.
That is probably the smartest play i have heard in a bit. If you are gme bull. Doubt anything at 13 or lower gets assigmed tho, no matter what
Puts on you
I am very happy to know that this was genuine. Well fucking done, you are now the king of WSB and you are not even a part of wsb lol

LGVW Dec 2021 price prediction?
I have a big losing credit spread I need to rollout over the end of the year.  If I were to just close it at a loss it would offset a lot of gains, but I think a rollout would be a wash sale and so the gain/loss would all go to next year?  Anyone done this?
I didn't remortgage. I had the choice of getting a house next year but decided to yolo it instead :D. I'm not settled yet, so could afford the risk. Yeah you're right, day trading is 100% gambling. Especially on very volatile stocks.. But making smart investments into well researched companies can pay off. I mean a lot of the ppl posting good/great gains on here keep saying do your research, pick a company that you believe in and hold it for 3+ months. 

The only shit thing for us is they get options and we don't. We just have to CFD/spread bet...
I suspect it'll be more than half.
no need for crayons to determine that BABA and CRM are basically free money. Market completely dumped 2 amazing businesses with amazing growth for how big they are already.

Just when I thought I could not get any more retarded, I watched this. 

Good shit. PLTR to the moon 🚀
The World’s governments > The US Government. See how smol it is when compared to the world. Perspective is a small shiney light in a tunnel you ventured too deep into that suddenly gets very big. Metaphors are to help people understand ideas they cannot grasp. The light is a train and you’re in a tunnel, it’s a train wreck, just like your dumbass opinion on diversity.
Public hearing on the 10th. Approval on 15th. They've been telling states to get ready to do jabs on 15th. Moderna to follow after their hearing on 17th.
There's far worse than cali lockdown
Yeah, a market correction is not bearish. The market pulling back 6% isn't bearish, it's healthy. Why does it matter what I think anyway? when the market corrects this month you will see it for yourself. Doesn't matter what I say.
I was actually hoping to trigger the wiki bot again.
There couldn’t be a worse time for them to IPO
It's not just that you are shilling, you are not posting a single hypothesis about how the trade could go wrong. And u refuse to give your positions. Nobody should be listening to you
There are a quite a few of us. Probably because we like to make money 🤷‍♂️

But it's called "Morgan Stanley slashes value in PLTR"
So its dropping?
OMG. It has nothing to do with the year. Institutions have their money in the market. It doesn't matter what reality is, they see the market is over-priced (IE Risky) and they will raise cash. You think they are stupid? the year being atypical is just going to make them more panicky.
with a significantly better return

I'm so confused right now on so many levels.
🤪⛄️
Up too fast? QQQ is where it was at the start of September
What’s funny is u dumping money into a company with shady financials and govt harassment. Looking for conformational bias in WSB to justify ur position?? the US isn’t going to back off Chinese securities anytime soon. Fuk outta here🤡
Yes
Elon gonna tweet something and pump the living shit out of Tesla anyways. If it goes down I just buy more and hold. EZ MONEY CANT GO TITS UP
For those bashing PLTR and saying it's going back to 10$, here is an article from 2016, it says that Palantir was estimated to be worth around 25B at the time, the latest fundraising they had back then went for 11.38$ per share. THE IPO (Edit : Direct Listing for the salty gentlemen) WAS UNDERVALUED ! We are almost in 2021 and they stand at a 40B market cap, plenty of room to grow. Article : [https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/blog/techflash/2016/02/morgan-stanley-slashes-value-of-stakes-in-palantir.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/blog/techflash/2016/02/morgan-stanley-slashes-value-of-stakes-in-palantir.html)

This market is ripe for a correction. Don't forget that Trump would have the government pull a rabbit out of the hat weekly to pump the market. Now Trump don't give a fuck since you ain't helping him with his election. Doom is coming. Just look at the chart, S&P hasn't moved up this fast since 2009. That's just the data. Like 17%+ over the 200 day MA. This don't happen ever.
The penis prospectus. It’s required prior to IPO
People who wait for the dip usually miss it, happened last week at 38 and I missed it and knew it was coming. Moral of the story is with a winner stock just be happy to get in on a big red day that’s a discount. In a year from now anyone will be thanking god they got in under 60

CRSR on Monday?
I didn't realize I had switched commenters, and thought you were the one talking about Alex Jones being valuable, and that's the context I answered in. As to your specific claim (which is already a loaded question, because it presupposes the conclusion you think analysis should find), I was able to find references to it, and opinion pieces (including negative) on several MSM outlets within 30 seconds of a google search; the WEF website outlining it as *the first result* on google, and tons of opinion pieces from large conservative websites (nationalreview), all the way down to conspiracy, Alex-Jonesy nutjob blogs.
Damn those will pay off huge holy fuck
Go go go, Go shawty it's your birthday

Big whoop man, we're on a six week lock down that'll go on through the holidays in Belgium right now, except for us it's 30 degrees and not 70. We have a fucking midnight curfew lmao. I'd kill to be in SoCal right now.
Add to that the fact they have way less restrictions on anything they build and sell in Asia, and to some extent Europe, compared to North America. Somebody posted earlier that similar valuation as TSLA would put them 300-350 per share, which is also the price target for several analysts. 🤔
Lmao what if it's photoshopped??
I think we are just hitting that point where even bulls are starting to question whether the indexes should realistically be as high as they are.

Who knows.
But leaps are expensive :/
I see those NIO 80C 2022's closed pretty reasonable Friday (around 1K). Thinking of getting back in with that.

Damn, you are well versed at bragging about yourself. That is a practiced skill and I can appreciate the amount of time you must have spent talking about yourself to be that good at it.  As a person, it doesn't have to be because you are Asian.  A lot of people have that mentality, they just show a little humility along with it. It's what we call being a well rounded person. You missed the point. New money is a way of acting. You could have old money and still act nouveau riche. Taking 3 paragraphs to describe how rich you are is a prime example of nouveau riche behavior. Anyways, this has been fun. Some people are better than you. I still think you are 25 at best.

I’m not conflating anything. This was my original question and you ignored it to go on a rant.

    Where? Where can you find plenty of outlets talking about Bohemian Grove and the dangers of a great reset? I only saw maybe a mention about the dangers of a great reset on the fox opinion shows.

you realize that QNX is the industry standard for safety certified high level operating systems, right?

Maybe Ivy is the next big thing, but QNX is used for systems in a lot of vehicles on the road, sometimes even multiple times over. To take that even further QNX is also used in other safety critical applications outside of automotive.
So what happens if there is no additional news?
California on 3 week lockdown. But I was told there would never be another lockdown..
You're conflating analysis with Alex Jones, who does not do analysis, and does not provide a public service. They give the proposal, and if people want to talk about it, they can. But in the end, it's going to be represented in how our country manages our own policies, and that will be the relevant subject of debate people pay attention to. But there's nothing inherently shady about an entity called the World Economic Forum proposing policy goals in the wake of a historic pandemic. There *is* plenty shady about people who tie it to conspiracies about manufactured viruses, and thinly-veiled antisemitism.

American nationalist China EV bears keep saying “you’re wrong” “it’s dead” and blah blah blah but they have no evidence and can’t tell me a single logical reason for their claim while I have plenty for my bullishness. Whelp guess there’s some more bears left that will get wiped out by the end of No bear December. I don’t hate anyone and I really do want everyone to make money but I guess there’s people who you can’t help who refuse to do research before putting their money on the table. EV and China aren’t going anywhere but up, you can sit outside and hate and get nowhere, or you can learn to open your eyes and see opportunity.

great work man
Monday gonna be greener than your mum after last week’s flat ass
Yes, cold weather puts bears in hibernation
Fuck it. I’m in. Watch this shit crash like everything else I buy into.
Can you maybe do some more?
If you make it big enough to retire, as you are describing, then only withdraw enough to live on periodically rather than the whole thing. Taxes and penalties should not be a big deterrent under your assumption
with another 10k deposit she could be selling a 30 DTE leveraged call and put every month on tesla for 5k premium 👍

Sad days (actually sad couple of decades) for the working class

Happy day for me
That $7 billion pullout of vanguards S&P ETF has me scratching my head though. Thats 4% of the whole fund pulled out at once aftermarket on Friday. Wasn't an institution, looks like some fat cat knows something. 7 billion dollars. Thats big for a private move.
Crm Jan
Election day for the Georgia runoff is on January 5th. It may be on people's minds, but I doubt it would have a major effect.  The smart money is on the Repubs winning because dems only show up for Presidential elections.  Also, both parties are on team Wall Street.  They may make noises to the contrary every once and again, but that's all that ever is, just noise.  There is a better chance of Biden and Pelosi winning gold medals in the Summer Olympics for synchronized swimming than them biting the hand that feeds them.
This is true. Waited through a -%75, now it's +%70.
tf kinda expansion do you see in grocery stores? the run up to online shopping is over, you missed it. get your money working on things that have room to improve
They could be a TV show to be aired after "It's always sunny in Philadelphia"
They talked seriously about the negatives and dangers of the great reset within the proposal?

Any breaking news on stimmy, vaccines or meme stocks that should have an impact on Monday open?

The only bad thing is that we got vaccine.
It's a lie, strike price did not exist until a year after he purchased
Yea this dude is obviously a trump chump worshiper. People who are one track minded and can’t see outside their little world miss out on opportunity. China isn’t going anywhere
The amount of debt I carry is so minimal a car is probably cheaper than the amount owed on my mortgage. Don’t get me wrong, I do want to buy an investment property just because interest rates are so low, but I am broken between now and 2 years from now when mortgage forbearance is at its highest.         

I played national tennis. I haven’t heard of any Americans that were poor, played national tennis and had daily private lessons with Billy Stearns and Nick Bolletierri(I forget who billy taught but he was big in Sarasota, and Nick was Serena, Venus and Seles’ coach for a long time but my dad didn’t realize he was paying nick to hit on my coach while she fed me balls).         

New money? Maybe, I haven’t heard of a Korean that was born rich, although my Mom’s dad was a principal in the best district in Seoul, and my Dad’s dad was a “professional soldier.” The main thing my parents taught me is “don’t take shit from anyone because no one is better than you.” As an Asian, I must say that is a mentality I appreciate growing up with. It’s definitely a mentality that demands respect when you talk to older folks.
No worries! Feel free to ask anything else :) I edited it to make it a bit clearer.
I have $80c in jan 15,

I think $85 is too high of a price target
False information

Maybe I’m optimistic but they have just started dipping their toes into EV and their latest earnings were very nice
Yeah i was thinking that lmfao

part of me wants to sell an OTM leveraged call until we dip down at least into the low 360s before closing it and buying shares but watch us moon through 370s into 380 before i panic buy the call back and buy shares before it actually has a correction 🤷‍♂️

idk i'm probably going to have her wait unless she wants to make her own decision
Ah, yes, of course. I think I mixed something up. Thank you for the detailed help!
The Great Reset proposal was literally a public announcement with detailed, publicly available policy suggestions. They literally published a fucking book on it. You can disagree with them, but it's not some service Alex Jones is providing by evoking it for the pure reason of being nuts, and monetizing the fear aroused by a bunch of unsubstantiated claims he finds by anonymous idiots on the internet who don't have hobbies. The WEF, which proposed it, has zero authority to make it happen anyways; all the New World Order, coronavirus conspiracy trash it brings along is hysteria for idiots. And people like Alex Jones dabble in it because that's how they put food on the table. And claims that it's some shadowy organization pulling strings behind the scenes are baseless, paranoid, and in lock-step with the dime-a-dozen conspiracies these groups put out which are wrong 999 times out of 1,000. Yet, somehow *they're* the ones just trying to get the truth out, despite constantly being wrong, while everyone else is "in on it," and doing nefarious, evil things. 

Actual evil is almost always more mundane, and these wild conspiracies are not credible, don't hold up to even minor genuine scrutiny, and are boring, because they're all the same.
I cant wait to see what BB opens at on Monday. Slowly gaining retard strength 😂
Not true
I remember back in September, I said all they have to do is keep talking about stimulus and market will keep going up. If it ever passes, it will be one of those, sell the news events. They know exactly what they are doing lol.
If you do the research, those options did not exist until summer 2020 which is a year after he supposedly purchased
No doubt
[deleted]
I'm talking like in your 30s.
Funny because it seems most people are bullish on it. Do you really think Pre NIO day run isn’t going to go to new ATH? They are only going to keep growing so why wouldn’t people hop in now while it’s 30 percent or more under the value? Just thinking logically, so are most buyers and institutions. Most of them are greedy and think they will snag it under 40 but plenty of people are happy getting in at current level since in a year it will be well over 100
Sorry. If you buy 100 shares at $100, and you sell one call option with a strike price of $125, if on the day of expiry the stock is above $125, you will receive $12,500 ($125 * 100), no matter how high the stock price is above $125. 

So your profit is $2,500 plus the premium you got when you sold the option.

If it's less than $125, you keep the premium and the shares.
Are you a boy or a girl?
How do you figure that?  I realize it's a long time but I am not very hopeful for their future.  Their 52 week high isn't even 10$.  I say this as someone holding shares too.  Is there news I dont know?
Why? If you want to park money, use SPY or VOO next time.

So let me see, continued shutdowns, still 2-3K deaths a day, continued lays off, still not even into Winter yet, Thanksgiving surge, upcoming Christmas surge, Orange still hasn’t conceded, government shutdown, record covid cases a day still, economic recovery being halted, no stimulus still.

SPY 375 EOD Monday.
How did you go negative when you started with $500? Generally you need more than that before you can trade on margin or write naked options.

Anyway, the easiest way to get your account from $500 to 1M in a year is to deposit another $999,500. A lot of folks that build up massive accounts are adding more cash as they go. You also have to remember that we went through a crazy year. Anyone that yolo'd on a DEC option back in March would have made massive profits. Doesn't even matter what the stock was.
 
As for what you can do right now with 500, I think you've got a few choices. Buy 1 share of something big, like TSLA. Buy a lot of something small, like GME, X, GE, RIOT, etc. Or buy one or two options on just about anything. Just remember that options can expire worthless, while stock will generally always be worth *something*.

Yea. As an ex-user people fail to realize that it's not the drug itself that hurts you anywhere near as much as the side effect of staying up for days. Lack of sleep kills.
I understand but isn't state tax 7-8% a lot of states? So what I'm getting at is you're almost offsetting the 10% by moving.

Edit: a quick Google search I found 8-11% among the highest states.
BB acquired Cylance couple years ago and I believe this is BB’s endpoint protection product. Anyone who works in cyber security will know this name

Gonna laugh when spy crashes this week.


But for real, even if you are bullish, you gotta objectively admit that this probably isn't the most ideal entry point for SPY.
Yeah right how do I yolo if I’m already all in

Both world automotive and energy are trillion+ markets.  Calculate how much money Tesla would make once they’re selling 20 million cars a year.  And then add in same growth for energy.  FSD alone is probably worth trillion by itself once Tesla solves it.  You need to look ahead like this guy did.  Stock market is forward looking and not backwards.  You only look backwards so of course you can’t and won’t be able to see.

Twitch Plays Pokemon had a bunch of people try to beat a Pokemon video game by typing the names of the button presses in chat, which a bot read and made all the inputs, and it blew up with tens of thousands of people participating. They also had to for certain sections of the game do a "democracy mode" which had everyone vote on which button to press next. There was already a "democracy mode" style brokerage stream a few years ago, but I was wondering if you could do a more anarchic one without trade violations.
Ehhh it’s honestly a coin flip based on news today and tommorow

They get exercised at the strike. If you sold an NIO 50c 12/31 you'd collect 3.25 x 100 each in premium Monday. And 50 x 100 if it gets exercised. There's no way to lose any actual investment. Possible that NIO could be over 53.25 on that day, but that difference would just be unrealized gains and if you bought NIO at day 25 originally, that's still be over 100% profit in 6 weeks or 25% profit in a month if purchased at $43 a share Monday morning

I only need 1 10 bagger to make up for 100 10%ers (not counting amortization).
That’s a bit much lol might see a dip to 40 but it’s getting insta bought anywhere under that. Already consolidated these past few days and everyone knows it’s safe now. I’d be surprised but there’s a slight chance it could briefly dip again before mooning back up
Trying to figure out what this shit is doing here
I had previously commented this elsewhere :

Why? Their platform isn’t all that great, their ml/ai capabilities (which is not the main product they offer, it’s the platform) is rudimentary and something that can quite easily be replicated. In their filings they mention ai/ml 50+ times but their main product the platform only once. Seibel management isnt great either, they are bleeding money as a tech company. Their product isn’t great but their marketing sure is. I’m not buying but the decision is urs to make. The stock will prolly go up j off hype but imo it’s a total money grab

Tbf hes losing it all within 6 months regardless
Whoops the split fucked it up, now got 600k dollars of buying power

You aren’t gonna make much by “investing” $500... for the most part, the people making insane gains are gambling. If you’re prepared for and okay with your $500 disappearing in less than a day, you have the potential to make a lot of money. Just like if you head to the casino with $500, you have the potential to make a lot of money. If you’re willing to gamble that $500 (as opposed to investing) you can easily flip that into $5,000-$10,000 with a bit of luck. The problem is knowing when to cash out. The day of the Tesla split my originally $2,000 “investment” in a call option was suddenly worth $15,000. My goal was $20,000. A week later my entire account was back down to $4,000. By Monday I was back up to $11,000 and yesterday I ended around $5,500. 

Now personally I’m okay with this... my goal from when I started this was to try to flip $2,000 to $20,000 within a year or two so I can put a downpayment on a house. Proper investing will not hit that goal anytime soon. My brother, who introduced me to Robinhood and has steadily made 50% gains over the last 6 months without playing options at all, referred to my “flashy trading style” the other day, and I had to stop him and explain that no, I’m not trading or investing. I’m trying to win a house downpayment at a casino.

Can confirm. Just read the NEJM article. 2 kids w/ different types of sickle cell underwent gene editing, and after >1 year they both had non-sickle cell traits. The edited, sickle cell correcting, genes were also still active in their body. This is incredible news for the medical community and if they can continue this momentum with additional studies in other chronic illnesses we will see them either being gobbled up by Amazon for trillions of dollars or they will be the greatest medical company that has ever existed for 10’s of years to come. 

TLDR: Hell yeh I’m buying CRISPR
Imagine the agony of the call writer... still holding these 2000 Tesla shares for you and he collected $500 premium for it.

I've tried to read up on this but I've been getting different answers. Some articles say it's going to be decided at the meeting on December 10th while others are saying it's going to take a few days/weeks after the meeting to get approved. FDA is having a meeting for Modernas on the 17th of December
Don't give them so much credit. Greed index has been over 90 for a while, and I've thought about dumping my indexed funds as well. Plus, that kind of money means they could have lost a ton in March on riskier shit and needed some tax free profits to counter for EOY.
He’s dead like the rest of the bears, everyone would do so much better if we all decided to be bulls lmao
Lucky retard. It’s like a temporary retirement for you
I just started thinking about whether or not it would have been possible to have started a Twitch Plays Pokemon style brokerage back in March. If you disabled options trading, I feel like it would have been nearly impossible for a random group even with saboteurs to have drained an account this year, but I'm not sure how you would make it work mechanically with the legal restrictions.
Yea except there’s that fact that the company is growing exponentially and will be half of Tesla by next year along with setting up claims in dozens of countries for the robotaxi industry so yea there THAT lmao. All you bears growl but have nothing to back it up
The guy who got 200 000% gains on Tesla. If I did my math right it means that the impact he had on tesla stock with 500 dollars equals to almost 2,4 million dollars buying power on todays share price? If the market makers want to stay fully hedged
If the stonk rises 25% above spot price to the chosen strike you will actually lose that amount because they get taken away at the 25% lower price, and from the difference plus premium you cant buy in again without a loss - no?!
Yes, he could have withdrawn money but my experience tells me otherwise. Unless it is an All Time Chart you can't be sure.
Make Tesla memeable again 😌😌

Stop making it emotional dawg. Would you be happy with a 25% in 4 weeks? There's your strike, and you get premium to boot in the event it gets exercised. Then you just rebuy 100 more and be happy with free money
Wow. This is serious Dino juice.

Do not forget. Reddit is still manipulated  by mods to the hilt.

When ever it's to manipulate opinion on a political person or to pump a stock.

As we only saw PLTR gains during the run and we saw orange man bad every sub, mods literally declaring in non political subs (r/law, pics, breadmaking, 500 others) that they support Biden.

So brainwashing works. In this case they portrayed Trympy in a horrible way. Reading comment was interesting. They say thing like: Yeah, I dont think he is as bad is hitler, but I dont like him. BOOM.

Guy was manipulated to not vote for him. Simple as that. Reddit has grait power over manipulating people and making them believe all kind of BS.

Now 99% redditors dont trade sadly, but we can all make money off idiots who got brainwashed.

Same way as the election manipulation, PLTR and countless other stock were pumped and dumped here. I bet 99% of people here never read one single book like random walk or watched any Sykes dvd from 2008. 

But that is good. The day they figure out they were duped and brainwashed, the day I have to go back to work as I can no longer make money off idiots.

Until than, good life.
That selling has been going on already as the delta of calls like this goes down.

Let's say you trade in a roth, and make it big, then want to withdraw early. If you changed residency to a non income tax state, then withdraw the money,  wouldn't you lose about the same amount (within a few %) of money even with the 10% penalty? Idk, I've read a lot on here about trading in IRAs is stupid because you can't touch the money until 59, but really its just the 10% penalty.  Wondering if there's work arounds..

Currently it would be around 350 if priced like Tesla
I am not focused on that either but that is what has been holding back more studies. Promising!
Not too far out.

The analysts recommendations are insanely biased towards SNOW since the IPO was issued using Investment Banks (IB) .SNOW is projected to have $500 million in revenue at the end of this fiscal year and its its value is $90 Billion. While PLTR has a $1B revenue with a valuation less than $42B, yet SNOW gets a Buy recommendation and PLTR gets a bearish outlook. These IB folks are manipulating the stocks.
Dollar collapses nuggets become the new currency??
How many shares are we all going for? 🤣🤣🤣
Look at IPOs 99.9% of them drops 80% in 3 days after IPO than bounces back. 

So wait before you buy it.
I don't say this often, but you are easily in the top5% of intelligence on this sub. You should show these posts to your parents next time you meet up to discuss still being covered by their insurance.
Hey i see this format a lot. 50 cent i get, but what is the future date you've put?
What would the current price be if NIO was valued like TSLA? I actually don't know.
Why would it go down on their earnings?
You probably won’t get that I am 13 have been trading since March and up about 80 percent but it was over a hundred last week

Sir, Eastern Europe is our colony
When the option expires, the share price minus the strike price will give you an exact value of the option.  Before that time, the option may not be worth anything on its own, because it is out of the money, but the option will have value depending on its chance of getting in the money.  The closer the stock is to being in the money, the more time left till the option expires, and the volatility of the stock (how many shares are exchanging hands or if there is big news on a certain date that could move the price and probably some other factors) all mean that the stock has a better of chance of moving into the money, so these things will usually raise the value of the option.
1000 in a yea is wayyyy bullish but I think 200 end of 2021 is definitely a good possibility and 3 or 400 by 2022. Could reach Tesla levels sooner than people realize
meh, that's pretty small loss. You will learn.
I'm talking about the debt you carry, not your stocks. People who talk about money like you do usually say things like "interest is so low, I'd be stupid not to finance that." I think they call it nouveau riche, forgive the spelling, it means newly rich. It's when you think things like districts are really important so you not only pay the big ticket to get in, but then also have to show all the other people with money that you actually have money (and more than them), without having the patience to wait and buy with cash. Couple that with spouse with a shopping problem and you'll find that life in the nice houses is not always what it seems.
Yea meth rehab a million times better than opiate. Sorry you had to go through that. Hope life is better for you

I don’t have a net short position on them, nor am I that fucking retarded based on bond rates and expectations of rates. If bonds get to 10yr 1.06 by 12/17 or 1.10 by 12/20, I will consider opening up a large short position on any cyclical you want to point at. Until then, SPCE should do well/decent. I was merely attempting to answer the question in discussion as to why someone would open a short position agains SPCE. My current short positions are against RY, MPW, CRS, UUP, VXX(bought puts as leverage against stocks I bought a while ago and lost 10% on to date). All of my puts are leverage, and all my shorts positions are leveraged with calls until VIX drops below 15.

Soo... all in CRM, OSTK, JKS, and NIO calls Monday @ open dated 6 months to a year out? 🤔💰 Maybe NIO will be 1000/share a year from now and we can all be like 200,000% TSLA guy!
That level of bullishness made me moist not gunna lie
Big Money can’t keep both PLTR, GME, and BB down at same time. TOO THE MOON
[removed]
I have never owned a put in my life and I never will.
The farther OTM the less chance you have to lose the shares, but the less premium you collect

30 delta is a sweet spot for premium, but if you don't want to lose your collateral then 15-20 is better

I turn 150k into 100k in 3 days lol
ICLN slow boi compared to those, it loves being flat too much
I tried that with PLTR and got burned.
Did you try to pull it off and on again?
I read ever word this time, after buying 300 shares and selling a put spread (keyword: after). Thanks for the DD. I'm pretty deep in this now. One thing I don't understand - what does smartmoney see that we don't see that makes them want to short? Or why can't they stumble across WBS's GME DD's and see this... what's WSB missing hear...?

Also, how can anyone predict how much a short squeeze will go? It could just like 1.2x and fizzle right? as paper hands sell into short cover-ers? (don't worry, i set my sell limit at $160 doe)
He's only following the example set by the tsla bull cultists.
This guy has puts btw 🌈 🐻
A drop down to the 350s on Monday and high 330s on Tuesday would be fucking glorious, you're giving me hope 🙏
Do you know da way?
Yeah I dont full on binge out i just smoke a little in the mornings as its cheaper than adderall.

Those short sellers made more in a week in March than all longs in a year 😆
So... Buy at 9:31, sell at 9:55 +40% before the 10:00 crash?
This isn’t 2000x now everyone is desensitised. Jk this is really good nice
is the extra price you pay for having an expiration thats so far away worth it most of the time?
I would not be surprised to see F hit 25-35 by than anyway.
Omg I’m goin straight to hell, do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars
Day one, big all bid all in, selling by end of day is my play
10, 12, 15. The dates range from 2021 through 2022.

Edit - also have 2023.

I like to have a variety that way I can bail out a portion of my money as time goes on, hopefully for a profit.
Got some logic behind your anger?
Embarrassing.
Third-party apps will run on it, yep. That's one of the main perks.
PLTR 😘

Also, nonsense.
I did notice SNOW only popped after PLTR sank. I guess that's where some of the money went. Other crap like BB and GoPro that hasn't been up in years. Like someone is trying to hype a sinking ship instead of a solid company. RIP to the new bagholders.
Sounds interesting, any bear cases except for the TSLA one? 

Not a gay bear, I just think it’s stupid to not know your downsides and risk
There's options trading in ASX?! Do people actually pull a profit?
[removed]
It's all pump and dump tactics with GME though. The short squeeze thesis is laughable
I can't believe u/Weird-Lie-3228 has flipped out about people shorting NIO no less than 3 times in the past 15 minutes, 1 of them was specifically not shorting NIO, which he commented and realized his mistake, and then he proceeded to launch into an identical spiel about someone else who was also specifically not shorting NIO in the exact same comment thread a few minutes later.

Seeing NIO and Put in the same sentence should not trigger your autism enough to make you unable to read multiple times.
Well somebody pulled out $7 billion from vanguards S&P ETF aftermarket on friday which is 4% of the whole fund. So I think you're pretty damn fuckin safe on the spy puts.
Stop pumping gme please, need less paper hands that sell on dips
For you to be right, the company would have to file bankruptcy due to being sued for causing the death of a billionaire. It does kind of sound like that is what you are hoping for. Again, post your short position.
Imagine using elliot wave theory as a primary indicator. Can't wait for this mystical "short squeeze"

Oh God you are dead. DEAD.
Can't wait to see how GME goes. They're expecting to "hold the line". Same ones who sold PLTR at the dip.
I forget the source but something about a pink slip thing, idk how it works im not that familiar and I could be incorrect.
Never a dull moment with Donny
Sooooooooo buy long long call?
Agreed!
Will we get some sort of notifications before the highly anticipated but totally secret IPO drops in a couple of weeks?
Yeah I feel that. But this a huuge move. I'm not much of a bear but I've been feeling wary about the state of the market. This bull run seems very uncanny and its treading more and more heavily above synthetic support from the fed. Idk what I'm saying though, just feeling eerie

How bad will the drop be after the earning announcement? Is it around the range of 2-5%? Any estimate based on experience/historically speaking?

I want to hold this a bit long and average down when it dips but no more spare cash to put in.
I'm pretty new to trading, have only started looking at trading when all this corona shit happened. Hahaha Would love to own local stocks in the future tho!
Yeah I figured the meth comedown would be pretty hard to control for just 48 hours, when I was in rehab those meth fuckers would sleep for like 6 days straight while Id be going through opiate withdrawal. What a bunch of assholes.
Thats why I said I want to hold them
Sounds sustainable

You mean chase your losses instead of cutting them?
Just because they’re taxing it doesn’t mean they’re cracking down on it. In fact, it kind of means the opposite, since they likely want money. Countries all over the world are starting to put US tech in their cross hairs under the guise of equal tax (consider the OECD’s BEPS project Pillar One and adjustments to the permanent establishment regime).

Jokes aside, If true, I wonder why that is. If blackberry endpoint solutions incorporate machine learning / AI tech, you’d think they are doing well on the tech curve. Where are they falling short in your opinion?
That’s fine. Get back to me in about 2 years when we know more definitively. If you’re right I’ll donate $5,000 to a charity of your choosing.    

Food for thought: look up market tendencies for newly IPO or spac companies. I think they have a 90% failure rate.
Thanks hog fucker
Yes, albeit a very small one better suited for r/smallstreetbets.
at what price? they around 10 a pop atm
Honestly as long as your capable of choosing realistic strike prices and dates that shit is irrelevant
The "threat" of delisting. It hasnt happened, most likely wont happen, but theres a very very slim possiblity it does. And on top of that, theres a chance people have been scared off of NIO, at least temporarily due to misunderstanding. 

The stock markets go up and down based on perceived fear/confidence. Some people perceive Chinese stocks as red flags.
Don’t you mean bat? ;)

I’m down to compare based on balance owed. I’ve paid a decent amount on my house and paid an even larger portion towards my down payment. I am 80% cash, 10% stock, and 10% options on a 6:4 ratio. I’d say I’m perfectly levered to take advantage of volatility, while mitigating losses in case of a stagnant market(too much vaccine news and bond markets have been spikey). If you think 80% cash is too levered you should try talking to any investor. They would all say I’m too liquid until you tell them my plan of exercising options after markets on days with huge runs and selling in premarket around 2:30 am et when markets are highest(after large jumps and only on Webull or schwab, TD does it but I use TD as a savings account and for TorS).
it means you're gay
Correct. Have a loook at Sea Ltd (ticker: SE).

The shorter the DTE the higher the theta so you can use that as a tool to help you decide. 

Also remember you can just buy back the short at any time, so if it gets in the money you'd be taking some loss, but OTM you'll have some profits

Chinese EV bitch - get in, get what you need, GTFO.
The thing ppl are ignoring is that PLTR did not use investment banks for the IPO. The IB cartel is pissed and are taking revenge by providing bearish outlook when the company is projecting a $1 Billion revenue at the end of the fiscal year. Look at $SNOW fundamentals and you will see the difference in treatment.
Dope I love the charts on them and thought between QCLN which has Nio/clean energy and arkk/arkg/ARKF and adding xpeng maybe some Pltr it’s all I need to be set for life selling puts. Thinking of selling my condo in San Diego I’ve had since 08 and traveling the country
Was my first trade, to be perfectly transparent lol. Didn't profit a whole lot, but was able to cover the $22 PLTR put I had and have some change afterwards for more trades to come.
God I hope so
Quick! Buy some TSLA and show her so she will feel stupid every time she hears the name!
I'm selling puts, cause I agree, it will bounce back up immediately after touching 3x. Assignment wouldnt be bad either.
Guys. I have a 100 shares of PLTR, GME and NIO that I would like to keep. So how do I choose strike and DTE when I sell calls to collect premium? I dont want the shares to get called away. Or should I just leave them in my account as buy and hold? Until now I just bought calls/puts and got rekt fighting the FED.

I’m surprised by how uninspired your portfolio is. Like, there’s no theme, I don’t believe you’ll be able to contribute much to “class discussions”, sorry. What’s the point of going to study finance if the extent of your research doesn’t go far beyond “stonks go up, lol” and buying into memes and a few consumer tech big caps. You can do MUCH better. Do it.
You got more balls then me man in my mind it’s like 30% chance it even touches that again and you’d have to exercise it so damn fast before it shoots up from everyone buying at that level
If they're weeklies why not just go a bit further otm with more contracts? If your wrong, it'll be hard to salvage anyway. If you're right...well who doesn't like 500%? I remember hitting a spy weekly put, once. And it was a lousy hedge, might as well have been an accident.

He knowingly slighted you. He is supposed to inform you on any changes like that. You had only agreed to the deal with insurance. If they don't cover it you need to make a new deal. He can't just go on with a different plan.

Tell him, ah shit thats really unfortunate for you that the insurance isn't covering it. I'd phone them up and get that figured out soon because I need my car back.

I don’t think they’re discrediting his finances. It’s his attitude that’s the issue. There’s no problem with making money but to think you’re hot shit by posting your RH balance on your resume is 100% delusional.  Also 50k in 6 months is not that impressive.

I'm not sold on this one to be honest, how is this different from Habbo Hotel? Habbo was huge 10 years ago and it's a pretty similar concept/platform, except there's a legitimate revenue stream for content creators. Habbo's in a recession at this point, and in my experience once a certain player set grows out of a game, a newer generation rarely jumps onto the same game.

I understand your logic but I also see the orders whenever it gets near 40. Institutions are insta buying at that level and every “trader” thinks they are gunna snag it at 40 because their favorite YouTube investor told them to do it. Meanwhile plenty of people are happy to buy back in now since the waters safe and they are good with making 3x gains minimum in a year from current level. More people are long on it than short

I'm not buying puts though.
I predict they will open to friends and family until almost 1PM and the open it to retail once it is WAY overpriced and then I say fuck it and go back to watching TSLA.

I disagree.  More capital results in greater returns which allows you to dial back risk.    Taking money out of your account is like removing pieces from your side of the chess board so they can't get captured.

That being said, everyone has a different strategy and if it works for you, that's awesome.
Take a break, think of it like a circuit breaker for yourself, after a sufficient time, maybe paper trade; do not fomo, you'll get fucked

Well, this comparison doesn't make sense.  EuroNext is the largest in Europe and has physical buildings in 5 or so countries.  It is a pan European exchange. Not every country has it's own exchange.  It doesn't work that way.  Frankfurt is almost as large as AAPL on its own but Germany has several other exchanges and a lot of the German stocks are listed in EuroNext but not necessarily on a German exchange.

Not sure it'll go higher than it's ever been, but just recently it was at $123 and Christmas is going to moonshot sales befowe their earnings in February.  Premiums are low. If it gets anywhere near $120 again I'm still good to go.

With that said, if you haven't been around too long do you're own DD and maybe be conservative.

If you own a house, have been house shopping, or even looked at houses where the minimum value of a house or townhome in the district is near $1m you will realize that there is a point in saying “I’m from this district.” ^2 Again back to MY point of wealth, try to expand your view to that of someone much richer than yourself and you will understand how corporations can take advantage of taxpayer dollars to make millions or billions while generating no or negative cash flow.       

Edit: obligatory part 2 since you keep on trying to go off subject in attempt to derail the original conversation.
Yeah but can’t sell a CSP for a couple weeks on an IPO and I expect it’ll be much higher by then so I prefer to own shares cheap to sell calls on.

I’ll play CSP too when I can though for sure
Is this a guy or girl? I see stubble.
My bad I’m an illiterate fuck
Premium on ACB is so disgusting

On Tastyworks you can open a 12/24 short strangle $8p/$15c and collect $1.14 premium for only $2.17 buying power reduction per strangle

or to be safe $0.79 premiums for a $8p/$20c strangle
Let’s have another meme run this week
Sell the CSP and then roll the wheel when you get assigned.  Pretty solid in this type of market.
Ah fuck. That sucks
Dividend keeps it pegged at 30ish. Been that way for a decade. Unless you have some insider info you want to leak

Get into the c r y p 0 market. Much wilder and always open. Also banning this term in here for PnD is fucking ridiculous, as if there arent PnDs in stocks...
they parked that bitch at 590 friday then right after hours once the options were worthless literal seconds later they took the foot of the breaks and switched to gas and it shot past 600 .. total bullshit.

IdentifIED? Then what happened?
I wouldn’t buy NIO puts honestly homie that was a move last week. There’s a shitload of people hoping to buy it at 40 because it’s common knowledge now that the stock has a huge future. Institutions instant buy it at any point under 40 or 41. The fakeout is over now and people know it’s not going to be delisted and it should be at 60 right now. You do the math homie, I’m thinking 70 is a conservative estimate for NIO day and a lot of successful traders I know really believe NIO will hit 100 in February
Used to follow space news a lot, this company has done nothing since winning the Ansari X-prize ten years ago other than killing some employees.

I don't have a good idea of when to short this but the long term value is zero (plus whatever SPAC cash they haven't set on fire yet).

Funny, I make a remark about everything you try to point out, then you call it “desperately trying to prove something” when I’m simply answering questions.      

Actually if you look through my post history as I’d recommend to others you would actually find a gold mine of information and current plays, all of which you’re likely too retarded to actually understand.           

“I feel more confident in how stupid you are than the fact that I own my own house” is me trying to show you how dumb you are with your little tidbit points where you are desperately trying to find a hole but failing. I own a house and I am confident that you are dumb as hell.        

ROFL grammar Nazi trying to act as if writing on Reddit or social media is how one actually communicates in a professional setting. I can bet you I went to the school because I was on their tennis team and a 2x state champ(3 time as a team). When you start trying to use grammar as a point of intelligence you’ve lost, especially when you’re talking on a sub about trading stocks(money is the only thing people care about). One of the kids that worked for me had awesome grammar, but he was a high school drop out and an aspiring author. Unfortunately for him, he only made $2 more than minimum wage because that was all his time was worth to me before he got fired for walking into the liquor store at 5am.                

The way billionaires take advantage of corporate expenses is 100% legal and is done as I said on a daily basis.

As someone who is looking to keep a little bit of cash, selling NIO puts looks tempting and selling PLTR puts looks terrifying. I have a couple other plays I like more than both of those, but it's just my perspective on 12/11.

Predictions for Air BnB IPO?
For those who didn’t see, Atlantic Equities from London initiated coverage on Airbnb with a **$75 price target**: https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/buy-airbnb-shares-when-they-list-next-week-analyst-says-51606924737

Getting a jump on the competition, Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell picked up coverage of Airbnb with an **Overweight rating and $75 price target**, a week before the stock even begins trading.

At the top of the range, the company would have a valuation of close to $35 billion. And **at Cordwell’s target price, the valuation would top $50 billion**. He sees a company with the potential to take **a considerable piece of a very large market.**

He said the timing of the IPO is excellent, given that Airbnb will benefit as travel demand recovers in 2021, and that **margins will gain** from efforts to control costs imposed as a result of the pandemic.
He mentioned earlier that he had purchased 30 contracts. Screenshot says he's holding 20. Looks like he sold a third of the position and used the proceeds to open other positions back in March.
that was disappointing

Great job on this man! Couple of questions , I'm quite new to all this so never really seen an 'short squeeze'. 

If it was to happen, would it be a sharp spike over a few hours or a gradual increase over days?

Would the squeeze happen pre or post- Q4 earnings next year (if holding shares, would it be better to sell pre-Q4 earnings or after)

And this is all speculative, but based on your research, what price do you see GME hitting during the squeeze? I've seen some crazy numbers like $100/share being thrown around but that still seems mental to me.
* Retail REITs: MAC/SPG/UBA
* Energy: SLB/XLE/XOM/ET/MRO/KMI

Can't believe someone wants to short this
The year is 2022, NIOs robotaxi industry in 2 continents and car sales are through the roof, Xpeng is doing well also with state of the art cars and tech in collaboration with NIO. Bears still think Tesla is a much better buy at 3000 a share while buying puts on NIO and Xpeng for 400p. The market opens and NIO and Xpeng have another +4% day. Some things never change, time goes on but bears are still in shambles
NIO is already a meme, wait for a pullback

I’m going in super hard on this one. They’ve got great management and have gained market share during the pandemic.

Hotels are getting ripped apart hard during the pandemic and more people than ever depend on Airbnb to pay their mortgage so there is no more political will to crack down on it. They made agreements with most major cities at this point.

Before the pandemic, old boomers used to think staying in a hotel was safer than staying in a “stranger’s” house.

After the pandemic, old boomers realize staying in an Airbnb is safer than staying in a hotel with a shared lobby, buffet breakfasts, shared pool, etc. They are literally scared for their lives at hotels.

Oh yeah, that's from you reading my other posts.  You make large, unsubstantiated leaps in logic.  Your grammar is atrocious - retard. "Google this affluent place, that's where I say I'm from."

I’m forgot to mention; the absolute despair and anger I felt when I calculated the difference if I had just shorted the position instead of bought long. At that time, it was around £26,000 profit.

Fair dinkum.
At open likely. Depends on what price action we see in HK though.
My guess is Monday we will spring back from the price pinning that was happening on Friday.
1 in 10000 bears get lucky like that but the odds are much safer being a bull then just dipping out when shit hits the fan
How am I the retard? You are the one not knowing what Eastern Europe is.
If you had to invest in sundial or vff which would you?
there is plenty of chaos out there.  nothing is solved.
That would make sense. I didn't look too hard into it myself but I was surprised at how poorly it performed, meanwhile selling 0 DTE leveraged puts with 30 delta on SPY destroyed buying and holding
Won’t be boring for EVs and clean energy that’s the next boom for the decade
Everything’s priced in. Duh
Some bear is going to call the top and be getting all the ass
why
Hit the gym pussy
To be fair shit news announced last weekend and dragged through the mud until Thursday then suspicious price pinning on Friday. We can probably expect it to spring back on Monday but consolidate for a while before it gap fills.

I signed something. But I think it might’ve been a  contact info sheet, I’m not 100% sure. Basically I just handed him my estimate from the insurance company. Gave him my car&keys, then left. I didn’t even know it wasn’t approved until he was already done with the car and called me because he wanted the estimator guy to come look at the car because he said he found further damage and the estimator told him “this isn’t approved. This is on the customer”...

Hmmm. How much money would you need to respect women?
I worked at a dealer as a service advisor, insurance work can be a real pain in the ass depending on the company and there is a LOT of phone back and forth.  Here are the steps:

\#1 Inspect the damage, perform diagnosis and recommend repairs.

\#2 Quote parts and labor and submit claim to the insurance company.

\#3 Depending on the cost of the repair the insurance company may send an inspector to verify the claim.

\#4 The claim is adjusted/approved/rejected in part or whole based on the policy and for each line item.

\#5 Any repairs not approved by the insurance company must be paid by the customer.  The advisor **must contact the customer and get approval** before ordering parts or performing work that would be billed to them.

\#6 Parts are ordered and work begins.  Repairs are verified and documented before invoicing the customer/insurance company.  


Bottom line:  Did you sign a piece of paper with an estimate on it?  If so, you're likely fucked, pay up.  If the answer is no then tell him to fucking pound sand and figure it out his own damn self; he's trying to cover his loss for doing unapproved work.  Fuck it, call the cops on him even.  They **HAVE TO** get approval.
having used robinhood and vouching that overall, robinhood is shit, except for the fact that you can open multileg spreads commission free

I primarily use Tasty, but for example if i want to open 20 iron condoors that costs $40 commission while it's still free in RH even though i'm way more limited in choices when i want to close it

How is it actually to trade local stocks? Like in the ASX. When I was starting to look into investing, I was looking at our local one NZX(New Zealand), and just from looking at it for 2 weeks, I knew that the money I would invest on it will still be the same amount by a year. lol

Only hope is I know SWEs are greedy AF, all live in high COL areas, and sell their shares immediately, and they know the company is not worth this much.  But the institutions are gonna buy everything up and HOLD.  fucking boomers and their trillions think is some golden company when it’s a dime a dozen

This this mechanic was referred to me by the insurance company(that’s why I assumed it was approved.) The manager said he never had this happen before. I am assuming since he probably gets so many of their cars coming through, he just got lazy and didn’t call the insurance company
Baby, I’m back! 😂🤣😂😅
No, that’s why you have insurance. You tell him to contact the insurance company for additional payment if he required it. He can’t do additional work that wasn’t requested by you and then demand payment.
don't you need gold for options?
SPY needs a retrace to 366 ish to test new support before 380 IMO
Mind what those cougars teach you and you will be a sex god at 18
The way it's supposed to go is you get the estimate from the insurance, you can take that to your choice of mechanic, but they are supposed to contact the insurance if they believe it will go over estimate to get approval. I don't know what you do now, but this is why it's important to have a good mechanic.
i mean it's not nearly as annoying as two weeks ago but literally every other post was something about that company and as someone who doesn't have or want a position in it, i dont want to read that a million times over
That's what she said

Most noobs start off daytrading. It’s the style of trading that’s most beneficial for your brokerage. It’s also what people think of when they think of trading.

Buying a good stock at a good price and holding it just isn’t as exciting.

But when you daytrade you’re going up against computers. Algos that can do anything you do but better, faster, with no emotion.

It’s why 95% of Human day traders underperform the SPY
Yaaaa I’m almost sure they read how many options are in place and just realized they have to freeze the Fuking stock.. like I know nothing but if 100k buy an option on one Fuking stock who the fuk and how the fuk do the options get paid for????

$8 swing in a month at year end feels a bit of a stretch no? I would prefer not to have it assigned. How should I read into the IV here, the 10 day historical vol currently is around 34.5, IV on the 130c 12/31 for instance is 29.3, makes it risky?  Really just looking for some gas money. To answer your question, not this is not my only holding.
His own fault for fixing the car without even running the damages by you.
As a man in his 30s here is some advice - you really don’t want to play the single game too long if you eventually want a partner.  Some of my friends played it too long and it’s killed them.  Stuck dating weirdos or nobody at all.  People will start to question you as a person.  Younger women will be interested but they will always prefer someone their own age.  It’s just a mess.

27-28 is the max max cutoff, after that it starts to get really hairy.  And I live in a major city, I can’t imagine how it is in a rural area.

Well, at my job in IT we used Mattermost for a while, which is similar but free. Other companies use rocket chat, which is also free and basically a clone from what I heard. Then later on we started migrating to Teams because it came with our license, which almost all big companies have anyway, it has good integration, and on top of it you get video calls as well. We got 5k+ employees btw. I agree Teams makes a lot more sense than slack, which is just a paid chat client with gifs.

Now it is true we also use Salesforce, so perhaps at some point slack will be used, but for now I wonder why we would if Teams is already part of a license we will definitely not give up. And for companies that use Google instead of MS the same thing will apply but with Meet, although I don't know how well that works as I have no experience with it.

Anyway, even if Salesforce bundles their chat client and manages to get some companies on board, I wonder if it was really worth the 27 billion they paid for it. Luckily they are loaded, but to me it seems like a bad deal.
Weird comment. Every country wants to retain domestic ownership of its tech/IP champions.

The way I've been trying to look at it, at least you had the money from investing to look after your family, as I had enough to survive after having all my employment options stripped away by social distancing.

Or switch to another broker has better market hours for free. Td is 7am to 8pm. Not sure of the other broker hours but some are even better starting at 6am. 

Unless your using it to cover margin interest than it’s not terrible

Edited because Td starts pm at 7am not 4am

What color are his balls?
Long story short I took my car to a mechanic after my accident and gave him the forms the insurance gave me(the estimate). He said it would be done in a week. The day that the car is done. He calls and says that he just got off the phone with the insurance and they didn’t approve the job. Long story short he says I owe him $4500😑. The original estimate says $2700(he said he found additional damage). Should I offer him $3000? We never discussed a price before It was finished because we both assumed the insurance would pay for it. Like who the hell repairs a car without knowing how they’re going to get paid? Like he shoulda called insurance people before he worked on the car. What should I do? The car isn’t even worth $4500....

It started after all the earnings. PLTR went up after earnings. Most of the sub seemed to be very into NIO, which they all thought would jump after earnings like XPEV. Surprise surprise it didn’t jump and the PLTR gang started acting like they are the smartest kids in the sub. It never looked back since. Now we have a lot of bag holders shilling the stock

Thanks a lot for sharing this. Despite the rhetoric, actual stories of humility can help. The person that this post helps the most may never show their gratitude because they're still feeling depressed.

But I guarantee you, reading this will help at least one person. And you should feel proud that you were able to share this and that it reached someone.

You make one point that is important:

Having a supportive companion in life is priceless. I hope that those here young enough to not know marriage and family yet understand that life will eventually be much more complicated and much more fulfilling. There are more important things in life than these green numbers on the screen.

OP: thanks again. Way to stay above water. And good luck with everything you're doing, brother!

Plenty are on Gartner report who make up a tiny share of the market. Crowdstrike is a huge growth company whereas BB is thought of as an extreme legacy company. Cybersecurity tech evolves incredibly quickly which is why you see the pure cyber companies like Crowdstrike gaining share. They’re up on the newest tech immediately. Not to mention they have top tier salespeople. Not sure about BB but I’d imagine it’s a very shit crew. Likely they rely on systems integrators like IBM and DXC to bring them in. Trust me man, I NEVER hear about these guys when talking endpoint security
So good
This is why Tesla are fucked long term. Norway is the warning of what's to come. The most EV friendly country in the world and Tesla's market share was totally pushed out by the established companies. Volkswagen and Toyota will be the big EV players of the future, not Tesla. Tesla are currently valued as though they will dominate battery tech, AI, and the EV market in the future. It's not going to happen so where are the gains to be made in Tesla when all those what if scenarios are priced in already?!

I’ll never understand why people have “pets” just to isolate them away. Especially pack animals such as dogs. Adding to that, to have no compassion or simply just lack of awareness/intelligence to understand that it’s freezing cold outside baffles me. This type of shit really gets to me. I love animals and hate how some scum treat them. My temper would have probably gotten the best of me already and i would have to been at their doorstep. Problem is as others said below, a complaint to animal control may not end well. Personally though I’d take the chance of the dogs being taken away and readopted by someone who wants to give them a decent life and treat them with basic compassion. Kudos to you for being aware, man. I hope you see a sea of green this week!

It doesn't have to fail to be way overpriced.

Everyone is assuming Tesla will be the dominating EV car forever. I don't get how that would be the case. First of all, nobody buys a car from a stat sheet. Second of all, other car manufacturers will catch up.

Look where AMD was just 5 years with their CPUs and where they are now compared to intel. Things can change quickly. There are car brands out there with way more money than tesla (looking at volkswagen group)
Finally new lockdowns. Amazon, fedex (maybe), zoom etc to the MOooOoooOoN
Seriously though, do you know anyone who offers that kind of leverage to internet nobodies to gamble on options?
The c means a call.  If it were $40p, it would be a put with a $40 strike price
What strikes are you looking at?
You are buying the right to buy 100 shares of a stock for a set price anytime up until a certain date. That contract is worth money. That price in this instance was 23 cents per share in 100 share groups. So 23 each contract. That's what op bought and is now worth this large sum

This is not good discipline. This is gambling. Any smart trader would have sold a lot earlier in case of a crash. Discipline would be selling a whole lot earlier to not risk losing your money even if you think you can make more.
Positions?????
You can make money on calls that never get in the money.  Lets say that you bought calls with a strike of 20 and the stock is worth 15.  The next day it goes up to 18 and you sell it for more than you bought it for because it is coming closer to being in the money in a short amount of time.  The next week the stock tanks down to 10 and stays there till expiration, but you don't care because you already sold your calls for a profit.  I know it can be confusing at first.
What are the odds the big bois hold their shorts pass the spike if the positive catalyst is temporary. I personally only think that the big spike comes when the direction of the company changes not due to smth like PS5 induced earnings

Fuck took it for fun and it wouldn’t go down for four hours
That's because volatility for AMRN is 100%+. 

The closest I can find would be BA (currently at $230 which is what TSLA was at the time), a Jan 2022 $560C is $4.30, but BA has around 50% volatility, which is still pretty high compared to normal (TSLA probably had 30% or lower at the time). 

I'd imagine a $680C would be closer to $2 for BA, but if you push it to a July 2022, then maybe it'd be like $2.50. 

Keep in mind that Volatility affects pricing more than theta.
holy fuck but positions or ban

CHWY
right now nkla 1/20/22 $60 calls are a little over $3

so we're talking about a shittier company that has never actually made a car, further from the strike price percentage-wise, a few months closer to expiry, and whose stock is about 1/10 of what tsla was at the time OP bought this, and they're trading for about 3x what OP paid. apparently OP's trade was real though, so really this just illustrates how overpriced options are in general right now.

He would collect the premium from selling the shares as well as profit from the rise of the stock itself up to and including his strike price. He only loses profit of the underlying above the strike price.

So if he’s theta gang what does he do? Turn around and sell cash secured puts to collect those premiums as if he still owned the stock, and at the next smartly timed pullback he gets assigned and starts selling those covered calls again.

You want a lotto ticket?  NOK 2023 calls are .33 for $7 strike.  Buy 20-30 contracts for $600-1000.  If NOK goes to like $12, you'll make $10,000-$15,000 alone in intrinsic value, every dollar higher is bonus. That is 10-15x or beyond.    

The world is rejecting China and huawei. Nokia and ericsson are basically the two only other major players for 5G that can replace huawei.  Nokia has a shitload of issues/problems that need to be fixed, but it is a target for recovery. Again, this is a pure lotto ticket.  Go in expecting to lose it all. At least you get a tax deduction in 2023.  The upside is big though.

You got this dw, got enough left to turn it around.
The best part about playing SPACs is that you limit your losses because they all have a redemption value of $10. This is especially amazing right now when there might be a rug pull on the horizon. My thicc shares are only 10% away from redemption value but have 50%+ upside.

it's still ridiculously cheap. i've been doing some hunting for otm options that exist 300%+ its current price they're so rare.

i found one AMRN. i remember when amrn was in the 20's and dropped to 5.

even that one, jan 2022 call 35c is .3 each. that's 600% above strike price and it still costs that much. if we applied that to 2019 TSLA that would be equivalent for a 1050c costing $9.00. but instead a 690c costing $1.

What we haven't accounted for is that the other side is smart money. 
Which is banks, funds and institutional money.

So when you buy the call option you are giving money to the banks.

I was thinking about this on friday after i took out a small hedge on spy because my portfolio is so delta positive i am dangerously leveraged long. Timing puts is tough and long dated hedges tend to just bleed money if the market is in a consistent trend higher. Now, I understand the point of a hedge is like buying an insurance policy, but lost money is lost money. Adding to that, if i have calls i may see consistent small profits each day or fluctuation in an uptrend, and if i feel the position is not working out or my opinion has changed — i can usually get out of it for a loss, but still get some of that capital back. 

Down moves tend to be more violent so to capitalize the most you needed to already be in the puts — which is having the perfect timing — and we all know that is mostly luck. So the difference between those situations is calls make it easier for me to make a decision and get out of the position for less than total loss (usually) where as betting to the downside i am more than likely going to hold that position because it “could be the day we have a pullback” and just watch that money vaporize each day. It’s tough, and all timing, but i just feel like i can manage better being bullish.

National socialism was a losing mentality so it all worked out for Germany in the end by them losing WW2 both socially and economically in the long run.  Happy for them.

That’s cool about the ice ages though—sounds like a natural thing! Perhaps we have a more arrogant perception about our ability to control nature than we think.

Yes and I don't see anything that states analyst. Looks like you're a back office grunt to me, hence the 9 to 5 hours and tedious busy work. You're fucked. The probabilities of leveling up to something higher profile are stacked against you. Press reset and start over with a boutique.
I don’t know how you didn’t expect a response with something along those lines but okay 🤷‍♀️
sounds like you’re in compliance bro. get ready to toil in mediocracy until you die. if you were any good your MD would tap you to work 14 hour days and meet clients. and idk what the fuck you’re doing if you aren’t being allowed near a financial model. sounds like admin. good luck bro!
Was wanting to get DKNG LEAPS but the premium seems fucking absurd right now
Thanks
yeah, that is the risk of selling covered calls.

You can lose out on the gain as the person who you sold the contract to will win what you lose.

&#x200B;

It's the other end of FDs.

If you sell covered calls, you usually want to sell to the amount you don't think it will pass. in that time.

&#x200B;

For example. If I think PLTR won't hit 40 by the end of the week.

I could sell a call for 12/11 $40C.

If it doesnt get there, then I keep the premium. If it does or pass it, the person buying it can exercise the contract buying  your shares at 40$ each. So you still make a profit, but not as much as the guy buying the ~~FD~~  contract.

&#x200B;

Risk vs Reward. As a seller of the contract, you're the house in a casino.  you might not win big, but you rarely will ever lose.

Sounds like you haven't been trading for very long or weren't even looking at TSLA options at the time. TSLA in mid 2019 wasn't making a profit and hadn't been for a while, and by mid July 2019, it was down ~35% YTD, dropping from $350 to $230.

With falling shares and bleak outlook, TSLA had low volatility, and while not as low as SPY like you said, a 200 fucking percent OTM leap is sure as fuck ain't going to go for much. That example I used for SPY was only 50% OTM. 

Don't fucking matter what you think, that screenshot is the actual price at that date, check it for yourself on TOS, you don't have to believe me. 

If you really want to do the math yourself, learn some financial mathematics, and plug the numbers into a Black Scholes model and see for yourself. At the end of the day, those numbers are legit, whether OP actually owns these contracts or not.

The thing is is in your late twenties as a guy you're pretty much moving into the money. Delta starts ripping. 

But as you hit your 30s. Theta start kicking up noticeably. Things start taking more maintenance to do that you didn't have to worry about before. Hairline starts moving places that might not be optimal.

Then as you get older, you've got the capital you can deploy, but the market kind of sucks there aren't a lot of good options. Mostly just stuff with crazy high IV.

I'm not complaining as I've secured my seat in the world of high finance, my exit opportunities will be endles after a couple years and my hours are pretty good in terms of Investment Banking (i'm talking 9-5 good), however i've yet to come across this gruelling modelling and pitch book work that a lot of fellow IBers here talk about.

So far my role has consisted of:

• Oversight of the full trade life cycle through to settlement

• Cash reconciliation on all accounts and provision of funding for daily investment activity

• Resolve queries and issues emanating from custodians and counterparties

• Ensuring integrity of static data and account onboarding

• Daily unit pricing checks & trade reconciliation

• Derivatives trade bookings and managing daily collateral

Can anyone let me know when the "modelling" and "client interactions start", I guess I have to put in my hours of doing the "grunt work".

I would assume yes, otherwise they're mispriced and you found an exploitable edge. Do you buy a basket of them or pick and choose based on where the drug is in the pipeline?
you are correct, it's primed to launch up and I am out of buying power atm......how do you get in on pre market stuff, what kind of strategies/rules are there?

I just purchased 200 futures contracts on butter, based on your advice. Thank you, \*fingers crossed\*
Who did you jerk and whose cum is on you?
There’s a couple different ways of trading options. On one hand, you could trade options hoping that the value of your contract increases, in which you sell it for a profit before expiration. Other investors use options either as a hedge or a way to acquire shares at a discount at a certain point in time, which is when they would exercise their call. The only traders who should be exercising options are the ones who can afford it without margin.

EDIT: All options either get exercised eventually by someone or expire worthless
Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?

I'd like to know your thoughts about SPWH as a deep value play. It seems like a pretty good deal right now. It used to be  a major holding of Michael Burry, but I noticed he sold out last quarter. All of the standard valuation metrics are way below the sector averages, and they reported pretty decent earnings this quarter, including a 200% increase in online sales, but the share price dropped off significantly afterward. What gives? 

I can only guess investors may be abandoning the company because the bulk of their sales are firearms, and they fear increased regulation.

The kid never loses at games involving strategy, and I can reward him with chicken nuggets for every band he makes. I see no possible downside risk.

Best Buy was amazing mid to late 90s.  They used to have these warehouse style shelves packed to the top with videocards.  A whole aisle both sides.  Another aisle of hard drives and soundcards.  Lots of volume on a decent amount of selection. 

I'm guessing that's actually why Walmart stopped selling hardware.  But Walmart was screwy because they were always late to the punch on new hardware and charged release prices for months well after the next generation was out.  In some cases they had old videocards and the sort that was YEARS old and still at release price.  They didn't care.

I stopped going to Bestbuy after their prices started to get non competitive too and I could just order on Newegg (Since BB was an hour and a half roundtrip drive).  Back when Newegg was amazing.  I'd still like a local store that sells hardware though.  Esp if their prices are reasonably close to what I can find online.

All you have to do to understand EVs is drive one for a bit, and even better, own one. The powertrain just makes way more sense. I’ve owned one for over 3 years and have paid $0 in maintenance besides windshield washer fluid. You don’t even need brake pads nearly as often because bc of regen braking. Cost of electricity where I’m at makes the fuel cost 25% of the cost per mile when compared to gas. 

To quote Joe Rogan (yeah I hate myself for saying that too), EVs makes other cars feel stupid. He refers to his Tesla but I feel that about any EV. Eventually, range anxiety will be a thing of the past.

I have positions in Jan 12.5 (safer) and 15. If you wanna be more conservative look at April. Also considering a position in BB for Jan '23, those calls are super cheap
Ya that’s old and bad news for baba. Why would you buy it?
My dad told me tonight that he doesn’t think TSLA will ever go down

He told me the same thing about silver before SLV crashed into the Mariana Trench.

Bro, just cause there is a goalie doesn’t mean you can’t score, just gotta get nice widdit.
I'm a bull but I'm bear-curious given the run-up. Was WSB this euphoric in August too before Sep taught bulls some humility
Xanax is expensive. It costs you everything in life
That’s just 1 stock being bought at AH. This stock doesn’t move much in AH so I won’t consider that. Also I hope it goes up next week. 12/10 is exdividend date so stock might tank by 0.24 cents on that day but again this is a casino 🚀
Looking for some cheap leap calls I can jump into.  Any recommendations?
I was holding several 650s from the week before, watched them climb into the $300s and ended up selling them when TSLA fell to the 800s before diving off the deep end...

Rough.
Lmao well I diamond hand EVERYTHING so I’m either getting a bombshell in the next 5 years or dying alone with a few pets.

Unless the future of the company is to absorb literally every single car bought and sold in the US and every single solar system installation in the US this quarter, a $567B valuation is completely off the rails. I'm honestly interested in your bull case? Is Tesla going to be the world's only vehicle manufacturer? The only solar provider?

The entire remainder of your post is essentially to keep buying lottos until one of them returns the fund. Survivor bias is strong in here. Shit, the dude could have had March 2020 expiries and would have been totally fucked. The Fed could have failed to implement their programs, and Congress could have failed to pass stimulus like in 2008. The idea that a luxury car manufacturer would see its share price go up 400% in eight months during the worst economic crisis in history is insane on its face.
You’re about a month late for that buddy

God, I feel like that’s the video everyone started with. Maybe he’s the reason we all suck here
Its already at 20.38 after hours...will it run up more next week?
So you expecting a 4% increase in same store sales vs q4’19 during a pandemic with many closed locations vs ’19  when trend is close to 40% decrease. I can get behind the e-commerce growth but think their will be decrease in store sales... think your total revenue is $1b too strong. Profit margin is getting worse with waaay more console sales vs ‘19. And e-commerce fulfillment is expensive - 20% would be great with product sales mix. I see net loss even with your e-commerce revenue growth.
 will touch $105 before Friday
Right now you’re holding a call option on yourself. So you can sell now, and catch the best female bid out there. Or you can diamond hand hoping theta doesn’t work you too hard too fast. 

But let’s be real, theta is rarely kind, and I think it’s generally not for the best if your option expires worthless.

Anybody in here want a girl, but also very much so NOT want a girl? I’m so back and forth. 

Some days I love having to myself and could care less about anyone else. Some days I’m a little lonely and want someone to vent to about my losing option plays. Consistent sex is pretty cool also. 

I keep getting to the stage of somewhat talking to someone “seriously” then breaking it off because I feel like I’m too selfish to keep a good relationship right now.

I’m in my mid 20’s, don’t think this is an abnormal feeling but correct me if I’m wrong lol
Yeah I get the drowsy/foggy feeling too, but I always feel like that because I’m a depressed alcoholic so it’s not new. Definitely helps me sleep though.

Big tobacco have been lowering nicotine for ages now. It makes you buy more smokes to maintain you nicotine consumption.

If you want to reduce the amount of new smokers, raise the price. The smokers will pay or go to black market but youger crowds would probably just get into the vaping scene.

A diabolical interest in completely trainwrecking the entire system of payments and exchange. Think of it this way, vendor financing will completely breakdown as vendors will be incentivized to refuse payment since holding the cash will actually cost them money.

Where my fellow 26 yr old degenerates at
Let’s hope so
For sure, I'm sure this product isn't for everyone. They've done studies that show that \~30% of smokers are interested or very interested in trying the product, and another 30% are somewhat interested in trying the product. When we're talking about 34 million smokers in the US alone, even a percent of a percent (say .25-.5%) of the market would be sufficient to drive value to the company. Let alone if legislation comes out to make it mandatory.
Let’s hope so
Much better plays.  I have $150K shares and $40K calls in oil producers.  $0 in meme stocks.

Best Buy's selection is SHIT.

A younger me once asked an overly helpful employee if I could scrub windows 10 off a laptop and replace it with Linux without problems. She explained that Linux was only a fad in Europe and I didn't need to worry about using it here.

I laughed heartily, said "alright I think we're done here", turned around and walked out of the store grinning from ear to ear.  


EDIT: I was there for PC parts for a new build, and the employee began trying to sell me on a prebuilt. I did not find the parts I was looking for there.

Thats interesting. Because its not like my government wants those on the market because its light in nicotine. Since you get like orange, berry, grape and menthol also. Which according to me specifically targets a younger audience which is kind of fucked up in my opinion.

It fucks up my sex drive and causes extreme drowsiness in the morning. Those are the only side effects I notice.

But I take it for insomnia, and it works way better than taking nothing or just melatonin. I will fall asleep eventually after taking trazodone. If I don’t take it, I will probably be up the whole night.

Lower rates for longer (ie QE infinity) leads to higher multiples. Eventually though something shifts with the underlying psychology of market participants. All it will take is one big earnings blow up on a high profile, widely held momentum stock for punters to reevaluate risk/return. Tesla would make a wonderful candidate but first every last Tesla bear and short must capitulate.

> "What is the single best business in the world?"  His answer?  "If you could own a royalty on people spending money." 

Works for the Federal Government corporation.

They get a "royalty" off my paycheck then what is left I spend on goods and services.  And they get a "royalty" off of every purchase.  Some of the remainder is invested in the stock market and in savings.  They take a "royalty" off of any gains on those.  The rest is in retirement account to which they will take a "royalty" off of as well. 

Eventually I'll spend that money, in the retirement and brokerage accounts, on other goods and services.  To which they will take yet another "royalty" on.

So the solution is simple, operate a government and scale it big and tall.  Then you can charge all kinds of royalties.

Doesn’t China have a lot of excess steel they can’t put on the market due to import bans? With a new President you don’t think those bans are likely to be lifted to make it cheaper to manufacture goods as long as your iron worker industry remains strong?      

On Monday I am likely to buy the 12/24 $15.50P and $18C as a small grouping. I plan on selling the put side or call side when the profit on calls exceed 110% of cost giving me 5% profit and a put position to use as leverage against other small cap manufacturing plays.

Ya I don’t think it’ll last long. Beauty of it from my perspective is, if usd goes up the value of my stocks go up relative to my home currency. If usd goes down, the price of my stocks will likely go up to match the difference and my home currency buying power goes up. It’s a net zero hedge over time but it helps smooth out up and down days for anything I own where I can see easily how much price impact currency rates have versus actual individual stock movement. Most people aren’t even aware that their share prices are affected by currency rates

Look, the value-factor rotation isn't new, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-05/value-with-a-vengeance-investors-bet-europe-s-rally-has-legs?srnd=markets-vp

But this is one of the 3 big Japanese Banks, what makes MUFG different from MFG (Mizuho) and SMFG (Sumitomo)? Could there be structural challenges in general facing banks, or Japanese banks (negative interest rates) that might make it more compelling to look for other value plays?
By design, it's all been contained in asset prices. Let the "rich" get a head start before letting the genie out of the bottle. 2021-2030 it starts leaking into consumer goods and wages on the lower to middle tier. If not, we spiral into a deflationary depression and shit gets hella weird.

Y'all got any more of that liquidity?

Congratulations, but you really need to sell ASAP. Is there anyone even willing to buy those options now? There is very little time value left and no volume at that low of a strike price which means you are going to have to sell your position well below the bid price just with the hope that a market maker will pick it up for their spread play. 

Don't get me wrong... I fucking wish I had those in my portfolio, but get smart and cash those contracts in while you can still find someone willing to buy them.
Ayyy.. Holy shit, I didnt realize it was that expensive

Option contract prices are based off of IV, implied volatility. The more volatile a stock, the more expensive options are both ways. Look at TSLA’s premiums compared to NVIDIA’s.  
I’m not an expert, but generally I look for strikes that are unlikely but not impossible, and at a price where if the call exercised I would be happy with the payout. ($10 cost per share, sell $15 CC, exercises at $17, still made $5 per share and got maybe $100 in premium. Probably $100 multiple times over several weeks before you get assigned)
Everyone expects a not so great Q3, its the addressing of Cohens letter, rebranding plans, e-commerce plans, and news about this console cycle that may swing bullish. If there are paper hands who don't pay attention to what was said and base it on strictly current numbers they might be shaken out. But I don't expect more than a 3-4% dip if any at all. They need to have plans on how they're going to carve out their slice of e-commerce and give people reasons to shop their and not utilize their Amazon Prime.
Yeah, official tallies seem to indicate that. But this doesn’t seem to resonate with the life actually lived. I spend $275 for a piece of shit Airbnb in the middle of nowhere.  Groceries are going parabolic. Housing is up. What has gone down, gasoline? Who gives a fuck about that at this time.

Pre ipo buyers like Buffett got shares around $90 so it actually has run up a ton for them
You're not understanding. Internet companies today are solidified as huge profit makers. Investors don't want to miss out on the next Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.. Back in the 90s nobody could say if they were going to make money; At the time it was just hype and fomo. Investors today are pumping SNOW, Tsla/NIO, or whatever bc they know these sectors are profitable

$30c $T 1/15 will print, but why not go further out a bit and more OTM? I think HBO Max will bring in anywhere between 10-25 million extra subs in the 30 days of Wonder Woman stream.  It's a matter of HBO will disclose the # of new subscribers at Wonder Woman premiere or sometime in January.  Even if people cancel their sub after the first month, that's still between 150M-375M in additional sub revenue in one month for the experiment and it's safe to assume people will continue to sub in the month their next movie is dropping on Max.  The play here is just to profit on the first pump and dump, which is Wonder Woman.

TSLA IV is way, way higher than SPY. The two are not at all comparable, even if Tesla IV has dropped considerably that summer.
I'll say the same thing here as I said in your ban message:

> How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man.

> NO POLITICS.
Quoting the PE shows you know nothing about the future of the company.

Read Anti-Fragile and The Black Swan to understand how poorly black scholes does with extremes and how the only place to profit reliably is at those extremes, which is extremely difficult to do because it implies losing small amounts consistently waiting for the big win to make up all that progress. Traders generally don’t play that way because it goes against psychology, but it does work mathematically if you find places for it to play out.

I’m trying to help you if you’re really interested in how this stuff works, it won’t ever work that well on a first play, but that is the misunderstood place that black scholes underestimates and that’s where the odds are miscalculated and ripe for taking advantage of, but it’s still a very hard and painful grind generally, considering you should lose money on almost all of your bets.

I repeat that this event, although very lucky still, was a great risk/reward play because the options market priced it so freaking terribly by seeing TSLA as a not-that-volatile stock for years due to it being rangebound, while revenue jumped 6x. It was an amazing opportunity and would have made a great play for ~5% of anyone’s portfolio, but no one should have actually expected it to happen, just to realize that it could and the potential returns made it a fantastic play.
Fuck you

Actually, you can find plenty outlets talking about these things, sans the New World Order bullshit, which is about the only thing people like Alex Jones add to any conversation. From Sandy Hook to whatever, Alex Jones takes publicly available information and injects harmful, off the wall nonsense into it. That's all he does.

He's not privy to info no one else is. He's a dude who screams into a mic about crazy stuff as part of a business model to sell things. He is a net negative contributor to sane and responsible discourse.
the ban is to stop scams I thought? The shilling/herd mentality shit is already pretty noisey in our noise/signal ratio of wsb being worth the time

This bill passed both house and senate. Says publicly traded foreign companies need to be have their audits be shown to American regulators. Right now china doesn't allow that. If they don't comply they'll be delisted in 3 years. There'll probably be some agreement reached by then but I think it's spooking some people now since it was just passed

Yep
is that a real company? That one looks a bit too vague for my liking lol

lots of other ones are very clearly real companies with real clients and partners. Not saying they are clear winners, but they are not NKLA level frauds.

The stock rallied not because of the vaccine distribution (which is already priced in) but because some analyst released a report citing that that company would make an attracted leverage buyout candidate. CVS rallied in sympathy because its arguably the superior company and therefore if WBA is worth X, CVS is worth X+1.

The argument is the company is mismanaged and needs a private set of owners to extract its intrinsic value.

 I used to know a guy who would do a “T rex routine” he called it on occasion.  All of our friends would encourage it, chanting "DOOOOO THE DINOSAUUUR, DO-THE-DINOSAURRRR". 

Then he would strip down to his boxers, feed his arms under the waistband of them and out the leg holes, and lift so he had a wedgie which resulted in each testicle hanging out the side. 

His arms would be restricted into the T-rex pose and he would chase girls around roaring.

One of the most fucked up but hilarious things I’ve seen in my life. Would definitely not get away with it these days lol

Some people laugh at those who invest in obviously over-valued tech companies; others laugh at those who invest in penny stocks where the DD is more challenging to be confident its not nonsense. All of us laugh at those who buy options based on what WSB tells them to do.

Everyones got their own approach though

So we going shares or optikns on this one. What position if options
🤡
Haha. I couldn’t even afford to short Tesla if I wanted too
 

I'm not complaining as I've secured my seat in the world of high finance, my exit opportunities will be endles after a couple years and my hours are pretty good in terms of IB (i'm talking 9-5 good), however i've yet to come across this gruelling modelling and pitch book work that a lot of fellow IBers here talk about.

So far my role has consisted of:

• Oversight of the full trade life cycle through to settlement

• Cash reconciliation on all accounts and provision of funding for daily investment activity

• Resolve queries and issues emanating from custodians and counterparties

• Ensuring integrity of static data and account onboarding

• Daily unit pricing checks & trade reconciliation

• Derivatives trade bookings and managing daily collateral

Can anyone let me know when the "modelling" and "client interactions start", I guess I have to put in my hours of doing the "grunt work".

Sell weekly covered calls?
> Eventually you’ll get assigned (share price ends week above $15, and you’ll have to sell 100 shares at $15 even if market is $17)
> At this point you sell CSP (Cash secured puts) because you want those shares back, collecting additional premium. Market value is now $17, you sell a put for $12.
> Repeat weekly, eventually you’ll get assigned and now you

What I don't understand is how you choose the value, in your example, to sell the 100 shares for $15. Is it just arbitrary, based off feeling, or is there a way to calculate what value you should be selling your covered call at?

While you are right, it does not mean the market cares, will price it appropriately, or they will ever gain the traction they need as a company to scale to where they need to make real money.

That's why I said that you can't be greedy and accept early loss on the CC.

I sold a $45 when it was $35. It jumped to $50. I would either sell for $45 or cover buy it to close for a loss. I thought, hell it gotta go down a bit after a $15 jump right? So i kept rolling it. It reached $70 and I was still rolling, at some point I just accepted defeat and will try to regain with some aggressive covered calls, but honestly it's hard to believe I will have any success wit the pace NET is going.

Take a look at Kamikaze Cash on YouTube, his video on the wheel strategy is excellent for learning the method.

So the cash secured puts portion of the wheel begins when your covered calls you’ve been selling get exercised, which basically means you have to sell your 100 shares to the buyer at the given strike price. 

So what now? Well, you’re sitting on a pile of cash that you received from selling 100 shares of stock, so you sell OTM puts just like before with the covered calls because you want to collect the premium from the buyers. Once the puts expire worthless, you get to keep the premium, again, just like the covered calls. Eventually, your put option you sell will expire ITM so you will be assigned the 100 shares of the underlying stock. And guess what? You’re back to square one, start selling covered calls again and keep collecting that premium baby.

Once again, I highly recommend Kamikaze Cash on YouTube. He explains the thetagang strategies way better than I could, and he keeps the videos brief and to the point. Go check him out.

It's just a giant contradiction. Everything is going back to normal so retailers like JWN and M should go back to normal.

But then OSTK and W are way up because there is a new normal where people buying more things online, and that trend is here to stay.

So which is it? Are people going to buy online or are they not? You can't have both sides of the brick-and-mortar vs ecommerce battle end up winners.

Usually you don’t get PTO until after probationary period of 60-90 days. So yeah, sure you could do that after that. Usually with bereavement you have to produce proof of death and they’ll usually only give it to you if it’s family, someone you lived with, or you found the body and are having ptsd or something.

How reasonable do you think it would be to put $100k into PLTR shares on Monday and let it sit for a year? Do you think $100k could be doubled at least, or is there a good chance of losing it all?
I might double down some more next week, up 120% on my 200 Feb $20 calls, good call bro, pun intended
Yeah, and it ends up being a taxable wash sale, as well as a bunch more hassle managing and tracking the wheels. If I had more time I'd probably play the wheel more, but right now 85% stock and 15% calls 2-12 months out works better for my limited brain. Hold stocks, watch for calls go uppie, profit

How’d you get a job here anyway ya fuck face?
I may be a little biased since I got in the company when it was trading in the 9$ range (was anticipating the IPO for many years now, and was pleasantly surprised at the DPO announcement), but I do not think PLTR actually has any valid comps. No company does what Palantir does. Google may have the capabilities to do it, but they don't and won't (and is not a good company to compare pltr with anyways, due to entirely different products and business model).

It's important to realize that if Palantir wanted to make a lot of money in the short term, they'd do what the entirety of silicon valley has been doing since day one: sell your data to advertisers. But they choose to pursue endeavors with more social and economical impact, such as vaccine allocation distribution, and military throughput. It's also important to realize that while most tech companies seek to replace humans with machines and algorithms, Palantir's goal is to enhance human capability with tech but NOT replace humans. Humans will always be an integral part of how their software functions.

All in all, it's a fascinating company and Alex Karp is truly a genius. Gives me Gates, Musk vibes (not memeing). It's hard to say what PLTR will look like in 10 years, but I am very bullish in their vision and current product offering. If you want to just compare to snowflake, it currently generates more revenue than SNOW and at a much lower marketcap.
Why try and discredit someone who found a way to make money while being laid off? Whether you think it’s dumb or not, they made money. And if you don’t think it’s a lot of money,they still had more money than they had. Who wouldn’t take 50k ? People never cease to amaze me

There are different ways to look at it. They profit more highly than shares when realized volatility is less than IV. But you don’t want a covered call strategy on a stock you think will go down either.  To me I’m thrilled if I can augment the performance of shares as I still own the non-expiring position and generated a little cash flow to buy more shares. And I don’t really want shares of companies unless they are long term holds. 

I think of it as selling off some potential upside in exchange for some downside protection.

This tracks with my research but the DXY is facing a massive headwind right now at cross points with almost all currencies. I don’t think it will last long (it never does), unless we close below the 86-87 support then we’re looking at a bearish trend for 4-5 years followed by a 4-5 year retracement back to current/higher levels.

My thoughts exactly. I can’t believe how many people here think you can find arbitrage across such a large class of stocks based on arbitrary metrics (like IV) as opposed to actually determining if the market has undervalued or overvalued the stock and over what tike frame a correction would occur, absent any other events. Any cross cutting low hanging fruit IMO would have been coded by algos long ago

With interest rates so low, traditional models and fundamental analysis are rather useless. If you know anything about finance, determining the value of a firm is based on discounting cashflows by the risk free rate. With interest rates so low, valuations are just through the roof across the board.

My suggestion, and what has served me well, is to look at comparables within industries. Analyze the multiples within industries, as well as the management, to determine what is overvalued and undervalued.

If you're playing short term options though, brush up on your TA.

You can sell calls using your shares as collateral and receive credit to lower your cost basis. Just Google covered calls.

So, so far, for evidence that this is **absolute bullshit** and you guys are all retarded for falling for shit like this all the time, is:

- The image he linked for his All timeline is missing percentages and start date. You can also see the edits he made if you look closely enough with low brightness. Fake.

**And also:**

- The $136 contracts didn't exist until September 2020. But even if you pick a similar contract that did exist such as the 15Jan21 120C they only went from $20(if bought at the bottom in 2019, split adjusted) to $500, which is a 25x return(2500%).

[He's the chart for his imaginary 136C, they didnt even exist until September](https://imgur.com/ogsJ6PZ)

**To which OP Replied (and got downvoted for being exposed):**

**"That is because this when the stock split. A $680 call becomes 5 $136 calls on a 5 to 1 split that happened... you guessed it... in September 2020."**

**Nope.** Contracts don't stop existing after split, they split just like the stock...again you show you're a lying fgt...also split was in august not that it matters. And as I said, the numbers I gave you are split adjusted already.

Nice larping though fgt

I don’t think covered calls are free money, but I also think they are under appreciated to bring higher risk and higher IV companies into portfolios with lower risk appetites.

Covered calls on ARKK seems like a sensible investment side by side compared to outright QQQ.
Right, because all the other palantards who bought calls instead of shares at 30 really came out on top, didn't they?

That makes sense. Also is it better to sell weekly OTM, since it is lower risk? But less chance of profit as the premium is lower
not fomoing is your first mistake

They’re trying, have you seen their expenses? It’s hard to have so much debt with their numbers of subscriptions, but they manage it. You can’t just make a hit show. Like you said mando is the only one of its kind on Disney +
I think it’s because they’re running out of good ideas. Disney could literally pull so many great series out of Star Wars lore, and Marvel comics, and HBO max for DC comics, while Netflix has to try 20 new ideas, and 1-2 become hits.

But if you remove the illegality then you increase the supply of hookers and lower the price. That and there is no surcharge because its illegal.

So you lower the rate of all hookers.

That’s also an interesting play. I’ll def have to think about all these things and figure out what the safest one is and compare everything. Thank you
Yeah, no.
far otm and date contracts are never cheap anymore, kinda sucks cuz people know the potential of gains.

however i was there at the time. tesla stagnated between 200-350 for YEARS. anytime it broke the 300's it would get rejected. every. single. time. people made a killing selling calls on tesla during that time period.

so given that pattern why would anyone think a 800c is remotely not flushing money down the toilet?
Yeah but no one will buy his call at 100$ strike cuz it aint hitting lmao and he’d make little to no premium at that strike
Of course you will. Thank you for your sacrifice. I'll be getting the vaccine too, but only after folks like you have tested the risk and either later developed serious CNS issues or actually come up cherries. See you on the other side of "Project Warpsped". Lol

Give us this day our daily gainz
Revenue doesn't matter, earnings matters.  Revenue is how much you get from selling goods.  You have to subtract that with cost of goods and your operating costs to get how much you actually earn.  If you get shitty earnings for years, nobody is going to want to buy your stock.
I mean they are all way under valued right now and everyone is aware they are the future now
That's the risk. At that point he would have made about $35k + $2k from the covered calls. Not bad for a week.

Edit: Also could sell calls at different strikes to further manage risk.

Bro we just had the huge over correction lol why are bears so greedy?
this subreddit loves you back ❤️
Oh I see now. So if he sold call at $100 strike and it hit, he'd still be profiting $76 x 100.
This is why OP is going to lose it all. Instead of recognizing this fact, he is going to believe he has it all figured out.
A covered call is more of a hedge against a drop than a doubling down of a stock. If you own 100 shares you can sell a covered call, basically say X is trading at 40$, you own 100 and sell a covered call for $50 expiring January 20, 2021. So if it hits $50 or higher, you sell them for $50 on day of expiration. It if goes to $49 or lower, you got the premium expense for the call as profit and keep the shares

The premium for puts isn’t worth it. Gme isn’t gonna move significantly one way or another. Option holders are the biggest losers.  Share holders will be losers too. Only pumping it up so the bigger bagholders can dump it at a higher price. There are much better stocks to be dumping money into, but you autists keep trying to push for that epic short squeeze to $50. Muahahaha
Thy will be done 🤲
you’re selling someone the right to buy your shares at a certain price. you collect premium up front, if the stock doesn’t reach the strike price you selected [really, if it doesn’t reach the breakeven price (strike price + premium price)], then you keep the premium and your shares. only downside is if the stock blows through your strike price, you end up making less money than you would have had you held. you can always roll out the call though.

You could make 150% in less than a year being 1 year out leaps betting on the same price trajectory TQQQ would gain in 1 year.

In legal jurisdiction for a decent hoe the rate is $500
You actually make some really great points. Average daily sales of $4k definitely seems excessive, despite the high traffic and demand on the black friday weekend. That would require a sale of 57 AAA Titles per day on average... do they even carry that many in stock on the daily? I think their ecommerce share is greater than anticipated.
So strangely in this case very, very high. Options (and all chronological bets) are continuous functions so for instance buying a leap for one year is the same 50/50 bet BUT each day (so 252 days) is a new flip of the same coin and you get to count every aggregate coin flip.

So for instance if you bought a $1 leap on a company that recently had a sell-off for no reason but had strong fundamentals you'd likely win the bet, not lose it, with regression to the mean.

Stats fascinates me but basically this is far more complicated than it first appears. Your real question is: "For the duration of the contract can you actually lose n days on a row?"
Looking at Koodo pricing they seem decent. It’s good that they’ve tried to reach a younger demographic through that. I’d still call them a boomer company though. That’s based on how their management operates and the business growth potential, not meant to be an insult specifically.
Surely nobody is going to buy them so his only option is exercising. I wonder how that would work for someone like me who doesn't have the money to buy the shares. Those contracts are only worth that in the market but if nobody buys them then what happens? Let's say OP doesn't have the 136k needed to buy the shares (I'm assuming he does), is there a way for him to still get the market value for these calls? Is there some entity out there that will/has to buy the calls? u/Anono-mon can you shed any light here?

Cannabis “crashed” after running up thousands of percent from the early days. I’d say that companies like Mind Med are still in the early days. And that they are developing IP in a way that is different from what the cannabis companies were doing. The mental health market is ripe for disruption. Mind Med is seeking candidates to help treat addiction, anxiety and depression. Seems like it could be a gold mine if things work well. It’s still early though. Uplisting to the Nasdaq will be a game changer for Mind Med and it’s going to happen sooner than I think anybody realizes or expects. I guess we’ll see...

Where do you think they will be in 3-5 years? Better or worse circumstances? Nordstrom just became the first department store in history to make over 60% of their revenue online, they’re becoming a strong e-commerce play. But if you want me to be frank, it always come down to greed. Most of the “in style” stocks have been priced to the moon, if you think WSB was a stock pumping cesspool, just look at Cramer, the guy literally told every boomer to pile on to these companies and was finding creative ways to justify their valuation. What’s worse, is that he is no longer preaching that narrative, now he’s preaching “pent up demand” play. Lol wtf

To go back to your main point, it’s indefinitely much easier and more likely to make a return on your investment if Nordstrom goes from 30 to 40, than hoping these pumped up stocks keep luring investors. Also margins of safety are key, I wouldn’t buy Tesla or PLTR today but I wouldn’t hesitate to buy JWN. I don’t want to bash these meme stocks because I know our little family on this sub loves them, but I just need to remind them to look at the prices their buying them for. The name of the game is to buy low sell high, not high and higher. It could work and some comPanies have leaders like Tesla that find ways to make it work, but generally you want to underpay for shares.

Value investing right there. The one near me has a car line a dozen deep at the least all day long.
The OPEC & Friends supply agreement was very bullish for the industry yesterday. Oil prices also have climbed over the last week. Lastly, these are some of the (relatively) few remaining companies trading well below their February prices.

You sound like the triggered finance boomers back in June that asked why traders are bidding up the airlines.
I also have 367 for Wednesday. So maybe those will be ok.

100% absorption
100% shares. Although I was highly leveraged on the come up. Sold and took some profits, now about 25% cash. And I agree, mid-term (5 year timeframe) I think these companies will do very well. But it’s a tough call. If I sell, it would likely be to rebuy in the near future, as I’m anticipating a significant correction from the massive gains we’ve seen over the past 1.5 months.

Palantir is the opportunity of the lifetime to get on the ground floor of a once in a generation stock imo. I only believe this because I'm a retard that hopefully will be autist one day.

No one knows, if you buy in get ready to hold for a while. Maybe wait until Wednesday just in case it dips following Q3 earnings. I’m holding shares and April calls. I think most likely what we’ll see is a melt up over the next few months

I don't understand this retail run up at all. At least with PLTR or TSLA or some other meme stock the 'unknown' can trick investors into believing something that won't materialize.

But JWN hasn't increased revenue or profit in 5 years, and their stock price fell 50% because of it. Designer clothing is not the trend, beckys want to buy LULU now.

Revenue is still projected to be 20% lower next quarter even though consumer spending has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. So investors are hoping that JWN can recover to where it was in February, a dying brick-and-mortar retail chain that has been getting it's ass kicked by e-commerce and changing fashion trends for over half a decade. Can't miss an opportunity like that!
Are you holding shares? Or options? If shares just hold, If you got a good deal on them, no sense in giving your position up. I’m in the school of thought that these companies had a deep reality check about their business. whatever ideas to improve it we’re expedited during this pandemic. They should hit 2021 with the fear of god to perform. Especially Nordstrom, my boy Eric Nordstrom saw 600 million in net worth value get decimated, you best believe he’s working harder to reinstate the companies position.

It’s only a dollar AT FIRST, but even if you got amazingly lucky, the issue of “who cares” would come into question once you have 50,000+ dollars and then are risking them all.

LEAPS are literally never cheap anymore. you'd never be able to pay .23 on even the furthest possible OTM option 2 years out on even the lowest iv shit like MSFT.

i check periodically if i can scoop up some 1-2 years out 100%+ OTM options for pennies and they don't exist. the closest would be SPY. you can get spy 550c 1/2022 for .45, but none for single tickers (esp tech companies). But the possibility of SPY going to 550 in a year is lower than the possibility of Tesla going over 9000 post split.
No shit they are ahead. 7-10 years being priced into the stock is how I know it’s a bubble though. That’s just such an exceptionally stupid thing to believe.

Funny you say that.... that's exactly how me and my best friend used to justify bodybuilding to ourselves. We thought we were better than everyone because people treated us like gods in the gym. Then in 2019 both of us were just like whats the point bro, we can outlift everyone, bench more, have 3D deltoids and superman chest but that doesn't change the fact that we're broke as dick. We need to put bodybuilding in the rearview mirror and make money, once that happens my dream is to go back to how it used to be all those years... but this time with money to back up my body.

Please do not go all in on fds. Very real chance of getting wiped out. Im expecting a gap up weds but if it doesnt happen, fds will be dead. Majority of the position should be april
IMO it's only risky short term (until MRTP approval comes). They have a game changing product that will be out there in only a matter of time.
People on Twitter bragging about their gains from buying stocks are retarded. It’s not hard to make money on shares when the market goes up 50% in 5 months. 

People like us, on the other hand, are autists. We deserve to brag about both our gains and losses when we bet everything on FDs expiring in a week or less.
You need to consider the value of instant liquidity.  Being above to move your money around to catch stocks as they rise is better than getting stuck in a position X days until expiration that isn't moving (or worse moving down).  

I'd sell 1dte calls and that's it.  Anything longer means I lose out on higher % gains elsewhere.  But each person has their own risk/reward tolerance.   On WSB, I get these distinct feeling people aren't looking for 3% gains a week...
Can you unban H.CAC? Merger date announced on Friday. You’ll have to unban it then anyways. Lots of good posts/comments being auto-erased. It went up 40% on Friday.

Also, summoning u/zjz
For long term yes...it’s on sale while the market is at and ATH.  Find the value...not bag hold at the top.
Yes because 1k / week is sustainable. 

That’s 1.9% per week. 

Compounded = 280% per year. 

Why doesn’t anyone with 50k just retire making 100k a year. 


Don’t pretend you understand risk better than us just because you poked your head into thetagang and feel like you solved the game. 

You’re just an autist like us except wit less balls for risk tolerance.
Agreed, so crazy. I mostly stick with real estate investing, but happy with the gain I’ve made over the past few months. I’ve been telling people about M and JWN for months trying to tell them these stocks are about to pop lol. Fortunately, some of my friends/family listened and made some money as well.

Not entirely but they are way more expensive than these Tesla Calls.

I’m not willing to yolo it but I will try to post the different companies that I believe will zoom up like this—- Amongst them is NIO but it’s pretty expensive already— Another one I’d say, is GOGO, Maybe Revlon— and a couple more that I have to look into

Did it fully recover?
They are 7 to 10 years ahead just because Tesla had their growing pains *years* ago when everyone thought EVs were still a waste of space.  They are also *highly* specialised.

They have a popular, refined product with the best technology available running them.  All those bigger companies will need to pivot and create a competitive product while experiencing the same pivoting pains and supplying their boomers with the gas guzzlers they still want, which will curb their ability to keep up.

Dude, this thing is such a meme it is spawning other memes. Why do you think every SPAC with a picture of an EV is running 80% each time a merger is announced? Every Tom, Dick, and Harry is chasing the next Tesla.

It is a meme because the entire automotive and solar industries in the US are $563B annually. TSLA is worth $567B now. If you think it is reasonable that this company is already worth the entire industry it operates within, the fuse of this bomb is already lit.

Unless he bought them for cheap, owning 6,000 shares of PLTR would be over 100k. 1.2k over 50 weeks would be like 60k. 60% return is pretty fucking good.

If I had that much money to throw around, I’d probably use 20% for Hail Mary options (BB, GME etc) just in case. 20k could make you a millionaire with some of the WSB yolos

That probably was a short squeeze, at least in part. People have been opening new short positions at higher and higher dollar amounts this whole time. You need a really high bump in price in a really short time to get people to really panic and close their short positions.

Basically he bought a contract that says he is allowed to buy Tesla stock anytime from when he purchased the contract, to Jan 15th of 2021 at a price of 136 dollars per share, no matter what the current price of tesla is. 1 contract is for 100 shares and he bought 20 of them. You can likely see why buying 2000 tesla shares at 136 bucks when they are currently going for 600 would be a nice come up.

Management basically has to talk about q4 (the main part of this post)  give guidance, talk about the success of their strategic plan. Not doing so would risk their jobs with cohen on the hunt.

Its possible something happens to drop the price. But im expecting a gap up from the call
Retail accounts for 22 percent of all call volume across the market. This stands to reason the retail call volume in WSB meme stocks is much higher than 22 percent obviously. Then if you realize that options being purchased are up 80 percent year over year, and options are leveraged bets that can lead to gamma squeezes that force dealers to buy the stock up, then yes, with a little bit of research I don’t just believe retail is moving stocks like nio up, I know it to be a fact.

There's quite alot of competitors out here but only a few enables you to trade options. My company actually reviews brokerage throughout Hong Kong, you can find the list here: 

[https://www.planto.hk/en/blog/US-Stock-Account-Compare/](https://www.planto.hk/en/blog/US-Stock-Account-Compare/)  


Naturally you can trade in banks like HSBC but the fees are uber high, think 20 USD per trade execution and they have a horrible user interface. TDA and Interactive Brokers have been in HK for a very long time, and had a relatively lower fee but transferring money in is a pain in the ass and they used to have a minimum balance of 20k USD and have inactivity fees so we never suggested them. Looks like they're changing though, with increase competition, they've started removing minimum balances, making transfer more seamless and removing trading fees.  


I can't speak for Mainland China though but I believe TDA and IB exist there. I heard opening an account is hard though since China is very strict about money being transferred out of China.
that's unfortunate.  it's actually a really interesting piece that covers a little bit of history of tontines.
The number of posts and comments about this stock should tell everyone that this shit is gonna tank hard. 

If you actually believe in the company, buy June 2021 or Jan 2022 calls. Otherwise wtf is you doin boi
50 is cheaper, you can buy a lot more

It's mooning bud.  Back to pre delisting price.
Lol, if the odds were anywhere even near 20%, these options would have cost $200,000 or so per contract. 

Honestly, the number of people in here who are even considering this a reasonable risk/reward makes me all the more certain that there is going to be a bubble burst. 

This same type of thinking washed tech out in 2000 so badly it took 15 years for QQQ to recover its high prices.

Total return is what matters. “Value” doesn’t mean declining revenues. It means solid, mature companies that are trading at a discount to their “true value” (calculated through discounted cash flow or comparable or some other method)

I really like Olsen. Ive done a lot work with him and the post docs from his lab that have gone on to have great careers. Awesome guy, and a true inspiration.

Funny enough, he actually published the first CRISPR protocol for cardiac tissue in rodents. Its nice PNAS paper.

I would not lose a wink of sleep at this but maybe average down to like a 140 leap
Nope. Don’t have a play for you, my friend. Just know that long shorts on EV is not it.

Its a bit funny how everyone wants to call some of these big tickers like NIO and PLTR “memes”. As if the people in this sub have the power to move these. You think we have the ability to produce the daily volume that these stocks get? These are massive institutional orders. MM’s are not buying heavy on these because teenagers on WSB are saying they’re gonna moon.
Another thing... the world has always been dystopian when you are poor living in a society that puts so much value on materialism and individualism

I knew there was a trend going on in retail when Party City smashed earnings far beating expectations the week before kohls earnings. Figured it was a trend. Played both stocks. Originally I had JWN calls actually but switched to kohls because I knew there would be a short squeeze since it was the first retail stock to report that week and analysts would be totally blindsided by it. 

Hell yeah man. People were calling me crazy for it. We need more sure thing bets like this. Bold prediction but I think the retail earnings beat trend is gonna carry over to Gamestop
But wait there's more.....

Yes, because Starship exists. Virgin has about 4 years at best to answer Starship before it's flying regularly and human rated. Virgin so far has taken over a decade to not reach orbit. I have zero faith in them successfully challenging SpaceX when SpaceX starts entering Virgin's market. SpaceX has already booked at least one lunar tourist on Starship.

Wait I thought they were literally actually dead.
Didn’t make the $150K on PLTR. I think he just made $246 so far. But yeah sell weekly out of the money calls and collect premium.
cool
Let me teach you how I'd teach a baby.  
Lets say you own 10K shares of PLTR at current price i.e. 23.85.  


100 shares = 1 contract  
10K shares = 100 contract. 

Now do you think PLTR will touch 30$ by 12/11? Absolutely not. Thats way higher than the current price. You can sell 100 contracts of PLTR expiring 12/11 and earn a premium of 2600$ this week.   


Lets say you get unlucky and it does touch 30$ by end of the week. Well then you'd have to sell your shares at 30$ each and you still get to collect the premium of 2600$. Don't forget that you'd make 6$ per share if it touches 30$. SO thats profit too and if it doesn't touch 30$, you get to keep your shares and also the premium.   


Now rinse and repeat this every week.

While this is the place for you, it's not recommended that you just come here expecting good advice.
The thing u r missing is 

1. These Companies are now mostly extremely high valued already ( Future growth might be priced in)
2. With these Companies growing , also the Competition is growing 
3. The transition always takes much longer than we think 

I am myself invested in tesla and others , u still gotta be aware of the reality , not saying its bad , just saying the high potential risk involved
It’s not that bad. Poors have always had to fight for respect and power. I just think it’s sad that we are so divided and ignorant of our collective power to make a positive difference. I do agree it’s sad we are heading towards a cyberpunk reality instead of a solarpunk style reality.

It depends on the disease and average time to outcome metric. For example, if you open any cancer study you will see 5yr survival and recurrence rates published over and over, and unsurprisingly many cancer trials dont finish until they can publish 5 year survival and recurrence rates (usually about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled). The trial CRSP just did was for sickle cell in an effort  to genetically modify the patients to no longer have the trait... since this has never been done before, only CSPR can give you that estimate. That said, you can open the link I provided above, paste the clinical trial number from the abstract into clinicaltrials.gov, look at the start date of the trial until now, and make an assumption about the rate of enrollment of patients (maybe year or so for a few hundred patients in a trial like this), and then from the theoretical last date of enrollment you now can estimate when they would release data, and of course this is all delayed y the time it takes them to set up a multi-institutional phase 3, which will be another year anyway. Like I said - this will take time. Likely another 2-3 years, if I had to guess without doing the shit I discussed above.

This strategy is less about profitability and growth than it is about income. As I mentioned, you collect premiums on each call option you sell, and as long as it’s not exercised, you’re able to keep that premium. Now imagine you have 6,000 shares of the stock, like OP does for PLTR. That means that he can sell around 60 call options to the idiots who buy way OTM calls. If he sells that amount, with an average premium of say, $20, that means he would be receiving weekly premiums totaling $1200. And that’s at a minimum.

Q3 earnings call is Tues after close. Bad earnings are expected, guidance is more important.

Safest play is selling weekly puts because of high IV. Strike depends on risk tolerance and where you're willing to buy. Worst case you buy the dip. In all other cases you make money. Q4 earnings are going to be great

yes, i've release apps on blackberry phones before, it was no different than releasing on apple or play store really, since their phones use android nowadays...., in fact, they even sent me a cool shirt for having a pretty popular app on their app store, i still wear it even after almost 10 years. but i don't think this is about their phones, it's about integrating their systems with amazons appstore in cars.
This is the way
a lot of what youre talking about isn't necessarilly gene lottery based but is more fetal environment or even early childhood environment. it pays to look into shit that disturbs you. I recommend at the very least reading some laymens stuff. check sapolsky out at the very least. funny easy to understand and you'll be more informed than pop science/tabloid level.
But store pickup and same-day delivery would be captured in your e-commerce sales numbers. That means brick-and-mortar daily sales estimates are still large. Basically each store needs to be selling 80 or so equivalents of new $60 games each and every day
This would be an easy business to start up. Not exactly my cup of tea though, because you generally are stuck in a single location.

It's not if you are broke and have bills. But that why I'm saying take the $25k and set it aside to cover your costs for a while.
If GME is over 100% shorted, why didn't the short squeeze happen during it's run from $5 to $19?
double it before they realize you dont have 25k that way you have 25k in ur account after they take their 25k back 🤡

Being Self Employed can feel really fucking isolating at times, and you have to learn a lot of self coping mechanisms.

 That being said, once you get your business rolling it's pretty fucking great. I'm traveling out of the country beginning this week all the way to the end of January, and already have about $90k in deals that will be going on during my trip and will close when I get back. And yes, I'll also be trading as well the entire time. 

Anybody who manages to build up like $25k+ in tendies should take some time and start a business. And continue to trade obviously. But get something else that provides you a high income as well. My business is almost passive at this point, because nobody is as skilled as I am and I could do this shit in my sleep.

Doudna still steers NTLA.

Feng Zheng seems to be in charge at EDIT.

Beam is David Liu’s brainchild.

David Liu has the best technology. I think BEAM is the best long term hold. He has CRISPR with supposedly no off-target effects and it can cut anywhere

People think shits bad now just wait until gene editing really comes into play. It’ll be the political wedge issue of the century. Whose allowed to get treatment? Does it widen the class gap since only the rich can afford treatment? Do we allow the 1% to make their kids smart and athletic while the poors get nothing? Which diseases are bad enough to allow gene treatment? Why does this disease count and not this other one? Then let the religious folks get in the mix. Does gene editing go against gods will? Is curing down syndrome in the womb an act against god? How about autism?

Or China is editing children in the womb and raising them to be super soldiers with extra speed and stamina. How is the US supposed to keep up? Or we have the power to slow aging, but that brings up questions of overpopulation. We could make age related editing illegal, but CEOs and rich people will just fly to countries where it’s not illegal.

We’re barreling towards a cyberpunk dystopian hellscape and the world is not ready for it in the slightest

Who is waiting for Affirm to go live in December? 🙋🏻‍♂️
Would this actually work? I got 65k lol
Ok, thanks for the context. I audit financial models so my first thought was “provide support for your assumptions” lmao. But I do appreciate the additional info. I also agree that the momentum most likely continues at least through Christmas. I also like that you’re using the 100k daily rate and not ballooning it for those outlier days of 300k. Thanks again for your work tracking this. I will be staying long through April, good luck.

Yo, thank you for the link.
Someone just asked me if they can make a lot of money in the market with 800 bucks, I think I need to refer them here.
This method is called The Wheel. Kamikaze cash explains it really well on YouTube. 

It basically works as a steady income stream, you just need 100 shares of the stock to be able to sell the calls, because if the call gets exercised you need 100 shares of stock to give to the buyer.

When you sell calls on any stock, you collect the premium that the buyer pays for that contract. That’s your income. The thing is, you don’t want the contract to end up in the money because the buyer will end up exercising the contract and taking those 100 shares from you, that’s why you sell way OTM weekly calls because the likelihood of the buyer exercising is very low. 

It’s a little hard to explain over text, I HIGHLY recommend watching Kamikaze Cash on YouTube he does an excellent job of explaining this strategy and other thetagang strategies.
EVs are waaay to mysterious and stupid to make a logical play on.

I got an $800 yolo. CVS calls few months out?
There are ~5000 stores globally, of which ~3300 are in the U.S and are chiefly (~90%) strip mall based. Shutdown risk minimal. Store traffic limits can be overcome through their store pickup & the free same day delivery they’re newly offering on $75+ orders.

International is the inverse, being ~90% in shopping malls across their Europe (France, Germany, Italy, mostly) and ANZ footprints. ANZ doing very well earlier in the year when covid wasn’t shuttering them there.

The launch titles aren’t anemic, Miles is crushing it. And I see momentum building throughout 2021.

You must be wrong on all your trades but this time you were right
Basically GME is guaranteed to short squeeze unless it doesnt. Almost certain it will be next week, unless it's not.
Or meth
BEAM is the best long term hold. Yes. I would high five you if I could.

NTLA, BEAM, and EDIT all are doing good things. I’m waiting for the correction to get in bigger. I love Edit’s focus on the eye and NVTA’s focus on the liver. 

VRTX basically has exclusive rights to Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy because they acquired Eric Olson’s company Exonics. He showed they could correct Duchenne’s in dogs with CRISPR, so I’m bullish.

The dollar.
TSLA closed on Friday at 599. Remind me what the option interest was on the 600 calls expiring Friday? Spy closed at 369.85. Remind me what the options interest was for the 370s expiring on Friday? MMs played the fuck out of many call holders this week. Of course if you were holding 365 calls, you made out well but majority were holding 370s as indicated by the options interest.

If you are going to do this switch to a broker with low margin rates. At Interactive Brokers they charge around 1.5% currently - this is way lower than most brokers
Good / thoughtful model. Your ecommerce estimate and console sales estimates feel reasonable. That would account for \~$1.1B in revenue. That means you are counting on $2B in in-store revenue (excluding console sales). With \~5,700 stores globally, that would be $363K per store for the quarter, equating to \~$4K in daily sales, per store. That seems high given so many of these stores are in malls where foot traffic is down - more cities are going on lockdown, etc. Also, there just doesn't seem to have been any major AAA titles released in this quarter (other than expectations for Cyberpunk 2077) and the launch titles for PS5 and Xbox One X have been pretty anemic

Best answer. CSPs are the safest play here and IV is likely overstated. At worst you buy the dip. In all other cases you make money

Come of Pfizer.
It's a good question and a lot of people don't understand options and just trade stocks. Options have something people refer to as Intrinsic Value that depreciates over time based on market demand. There are at least a few idiots willing to buy just about any contract until it's indeed worthless, so they have some value until the expiration date. Obviously, this becomes less likes as you get closer to an expiry, so the intrinsic value continues to depreciate until then

Look how fast the recovery was for the 2018 crash and obviously this one as well. Consider how much more liquidity, retail investment, and universal consensus there is on buying dips. We’re in a new era where keeping markets propped up by the fed and congress is a major priority. I expect any 30-40% drops in the future to correct as fast if not faster unless it’s more of an apocalyptic scenario. Seems like a worthwhile gamble, but a gamble nevertheless.
In theory yes. The issue of course is that the company could do poorly resulting in BOTH a stock and div decline.

I’m bullish on DKNG long term, my options expiring worthless not withstanding. Good earnings and momentum towards online sports betting nationally as well as internationally, and DKNG is perfectly positioned, it feels more like consolidation into smart money currently, while they’re trying to avoid having it have a massive momentum spike to continue picking up cheap shares.
What are your thoughts about the GME short squeeze theory floating around here lately?
Yes. Bill Ackman. Favorable structure to share holders and rewards long term holds. Potential target is big with. 7B SPAC lots of speculation it is Stripe. That would be a HUGE deal.

Mara gang rise up 😈
which is why it will be so easy for competitor auto makers to catch up. The only "moat" tesla has is in data/software, but there have been many companies developing self driving tech, and many larger software companies who are better at AI. There is going to be a company that just leases out their self driving tech to all the other auto makers and best case for Tesla bulls we basically have it look something like Tsla = aapl, and then someone will fill the android role like samsung does.
Only options. Typically at least 2-4 week expiry OTM. If I like a position I'll roll it and pick up a variety of strikes with early and far expires. I have some long dated Tesla calls for Jan and Feb back from Sept. That is the longest, currently sitting on a set of APHA calls for mid January to play the Senate run off. 

I made a 10x on MRNA, took profits and took later strikes. Have a play on JKS earnings Monday and holding ENPH calls.


My losers have been with JKS when the earnings changed from late November. Also PTON calls. I've played SPY calls weeklies and I'm even on that. Not going to get into those again, have me panicked in the middle of the night for futures.

I guess my plays are a bit meme, but got out of NIO before the run up. No position with gme, had a minor thing with pltr and then got out once I made a quick buck. I played SPCE once in a while but not for this bump. I got to 100k once before on the back of my JKS exposure in Oct, then it crashed. I learned from  that if a position runs up sell it take profits, roll to further OTM with different expires  you get the most pop on OTM when it first starts to move. So you can still get lots of return without sitting on your original position. Now I'm up on a variety of things, diversity is a thing.
Yeah but their mascot is that fuckboy, it is much less visually appealing.

Yeah, I have an okay-ish job making around 80k which is higher than the average, but it would have been difficult to live comfortably there. Can't imagine the people in Vancouver.
thats because he doesnt have actual analysis.  just posting charts and trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.  This is like what kids who take psych101 do after syllabus week.

If you’re young and earning money you need to be going hard on options right now. Blow some money up. Then learn to manage risk. Then start making that guap
is it? haven't gotten into it yet i'll check it out
It's all fun and games until your calls go ITM, you lose your shares, buy them back in at ATH, the stock tanks, and you have to consider selling CC's above your your cost basis or accepting emaciated premiums. 

Seriously, how old are you, 19 and never looked a chart older than April of this year?  There's no free lunch
if they spend about half of their cash it could buy about 2% of float. That's nothing.
Lots of players in the industry.  If 300 is garage what do you call 5-15 friends and family fund?  Lower end garage?
Maybe big dick swinger like yourself doesn’t bother with anything under 100?
Yea the volume is my concern as well.
Damn.
The fuck you plan on doing on robinhood on Saturday?
Okay ok I think I’m getting it. How do I sell calls?
We're upgrading our systems, so some things might not work right now. We'll be done before markets open.

For Texas you need 12 consecutive months to establish residency. Florida only takes a little over 6 months but you also have to get a drivers license there/register to vote etc.

It’s too late for anywhere to qualify for this years taxes

If I use margin with 5% annual interest to buy an MLP with an annual capital distribution @ 9% isn't that 4% free money? Regardless if the underlying stock goes up or down?

Would only get outpaced if the cap dist fell under the interest rate of the margin
Tastyworks  is 1000x better

You can make 1612$ this week by selling 62 calls of PLTR. Strike 30$c. There’s no way its reaching 30$ by end of this week. EASY FREE TENDIES. Even if it reaches, you still make 6$ per share
yea idk
Canoo calls the play on Monday?
Best year of my financial life
>  low volume fuckery going on currently. It’s annoying 

that's a cute way of saying no one gives a fuck about the stock
That is a satire site but still funny
Texas bull gang reporting.
I will hold till announcement, but if it tanks after I will NOT hold till merger

SPACS that don't pump after merger confirmation typically drop like a brick
Call them and threaten them with egging their vans or something
It’s 0% in Texas
You own 100 shares of X, X trades at $10  
You sell weekly covered calls (agreeing to sell your 100 shares at $15 price for Z premium)  
Share price ends week at $12.50, you keep your premium, and shares and rinse and repeat next week.  
  
Eventually you’ll get assigned (share price ends week above $15, and you’ll have to sell 100 shares at $15 even if market is $17)  
At this point you sell CSP (Cash secured puts) because you want those shares back, collecting additional premium. 
Market value is now $17, you sell a put for $12.  
Repeat weekly, eventually you’ll get assigned and now you own back your 100 shares.  
The goal is pick a company you like and think will grow long term and collect premium on the way

Buying $25k of RBLX shares in a couple of weeks. If you don’t have kids or friends/family with kids, you have no idea how fucking annoying the Robux is.

Can I have more Robux? I want Robux for Xmas, birthday, Halloween. Fuck. Off.

I’m buying RBLX so at least while I’m losing my mind, I’ll be making money and encouraging my friends’ future ex-wives children to spend more Robux on their in-game purchases... 

What we’ve come to as a society. 😂

I'm lucky, I work on a different mountain so it's not really a huge deal for me if I don't up for a month or two.  I'm guessing most resorts are going to be screwed because of exactly that though.  Why in the hell would anyone pay for a trip like that unless they were sure it's going to happen?

Puts on MTN because fuck them, they kill the vibe of everything they touch, but also because of sales this winter.
Someone needs to pledge to do this if it actually hits, do it, do it, do it.

Still too late for calls?

Ohh been in since Monday.

What's the psth hype. Worth holding till merger announcement?
Options and stocks are very different
No, the more people want to short a stock the higher the interest rate. Supply and demand.

I’m sitting on cash in case I need to exercise options after hours. Good luck exercising options aftermarket if you have no money in your account.

He literally just did break it down barney style... you have too much money to not be understanding these words
> Sold pltr calls.

Yes, with such high IV you would be dumb not to.

You seriously don't understand sarcasm, now do you. In either case what you just said is irrelevant and you know you're wrong. Low iq degenerate.
When I saw that percentage, I ripped my pants off and had a wank almost instantaneously.
