I read it, I was waiting until a merger date announcement. SPAC fever came again. I just missed out. Was gonna yolo on the DEC 18’s for sick gain. I’ll just wait until day before merger if SPAC’s are still popping. Congrats but it was looking real hairy for bit even if it was stuck near NAV.
Honestly, for your strategy, you should just buy SPY leaps. Its the S&P 500, its definitely going to go up and IV is so low right now that SPY calls are crazy cheap. You can get like 8:1 leverage with longer dated calls on SPY.

If you can afford them of course.

I would recommend also writing options against your long call to do like diagonal spreads to reduce your cost basis as well.
I dont, its overrated. Chicken almost always tastes better than salmon 99/100 times.

If they can turn the Mount Washington resort into a political summit destination then it might be worthwhile. Other than that there's maybe Gorham that's okay? Like the drawback is limited internet access and it's a massive travel pain to get anywhere worthwhile.

There was no calculations. I just wanted to make sure the newbies know if they get early dates the risk is higher because there will not be enough price movements. For later expiration dates, the price may reach a level at some point that makes the option profitable even if eventually the option expires worthless.
Shit, imagine your first shares being in BB...in 2020. Godspeed.
Im 23 just outta college homie, I absolutely do not have any money

Oh so like not a garage fund then you mean. Also funds typically dont pile into stocks. WSB and WSB hype can absolutely move a stock if it has a market cap under 10B. Nobody thinks WSB is like moving the indices.
Holy shit, BAN
You’re learning
If it was that easy every retard in this sub would do it.
Question on your model: it looks like your daily average run rate is basically just extending out the 100k orders per day we’ve seen so far through the end of the quarter. Do you expect December and January to be as strong as November? It’s seems like November had a lot of reasons to be extra strong including the COD release, consoles, Black Friday, etc. but what’s the rationale behind expecting that to extend at the same pace for 2 more months through the holidays? I am a believer in the fundamentals thesis/turnaround story but would like to understand the thoughts behind some of the assumptions in your model
Weeklies?
No idea where it can go short term (next few months). But long term, well, I’m holding my shares and not even thinking about it for a long time. It’s already doubled from when I bought just after their offering a few months ago.

Nah, I’m not Uber rich, but I have a few buddies that are. One of them used to own a drilling company, another owns commercial/retail property, and the high school I grew up in had kids so rich you’d only see it in movies(and sometimes movies don’t do it justice). Look up District 12 in Colorado I grew up with a lot of kids whose parents owned or created a lot of different products you use daily. Also, I may not be as rich as them or my parents, but I’m willing to bet my net worth circles your parents’ net worth like a hawk watching mice.      

To put into perspective, the ceos get paid millions to destroy the company and lose money while the shareholders foot the bill, and the prices of those assets are driven up because they are owned by an etf that passively invests and sets markets. I am 100% confident you’ve never done a single bit of due diligence into a company your damn self if you don’t know the basics. If you think fundamentals are driving this market you are a literal retard and not in an endearing way. It is driven by bond yields.

I have puts around then as well. Some at 335 on Thursday and some at 375 from Friday. My thought is that many company investors might sell prior to year end and take advantage of \~$400 pricing before a Biden Presidency. Not that taxing the wealthy isn't the right thing, but I think people who are going to take advantage.

Why is everyone bullish on cvs I haven’t actually looked it up
Literally selling OTM covered calls on your positions. If it doesn’t hit the strike rate, you get to keep the premium which could be anywhere between 1k-3k depending on how risk averse you are and if the share hits the strike price. You sell the shares on profit and also make premium.

Umm r/stocks or r/daytrading but it’s really your own fault for being a retard that would follow a random strangers advice saying, “pLTr 40C 12/4 Mooon 🚀”. You must be new.
Yeah, I didn't put much in and just wanted the free stock to see what I got. Just don't know much about it but am perfectly fine if I lose my small investment. Surely not expecting retirement just still learning. Thank you for your response
All the posts are serious despite their goofiness. PLTR had its run. Now it's over. Find the next meme stocks.
Just finished my essay for my graduate school application and instead of saying “yolod on meme stocks”  I said “built an investing strategy around taking short term long delta positions on stocks likely to experience gamma squeezes due to large OTM retail call flows”
you lost me when you said fucking Black Berry and bunch of legacy auto will crush Tesla.

Employee options are likely at much lower strikes than the IPO price wouldn't you think? Pretty sure everyone in this conversation is bigly retarded.  


The CEO options can be exercised at like 8 fucking dollars. Snow is absolutely one of if not the most overpriced/expensive mid/large cap to ever exist.  


If you think puts on this stock are so stupid you should be a big buyer of calls no?
Been watching that one for a couple months as well but don’t know much. Check out the link posted by u/mynameispdt for a more thorough write up and the other companies in the same field.
In this bonkers market, selling covered calls probably would have gotten you assigned and you'd have to buy back in higher & higher until eventually you can't afford 100 shares and you're out.

....how in the world is SPY on its way to $400?

The thing is, the stocks I own are going up at a terrific rate, so that most of the time I end up regretting selling calls. AMD, NET, PTON, DIS, SPCE, PRPL have all screwed me this year on covered calls with their random jumps.
I was missing two pieces from this Stratego set but apparently people sell individual pieces from board games on eBay. So for the low price of $4 I can finally sleep soundly knowing I have a full Stratego set.

Well you’re pretty diversified because you’re in the SP50. The whole reason you buy that asset is because having that many companies removes the idiosyncratic risk. I personally think there will be a correction around the new year (to me this environment feels very similar to jan 2018). If your jan 21 are deep ITM it’s fine, if they’re atm I’d be concerned. If you want me to run them through a model to tell you the annualised volatility I’ll do that Monday

Was setting trailing stop losses on the BABA run up weeks ago, and the price dropped below the bid. Had to close out manually, but thankfully didn't lose too much. Never experienced that before with Webull, they always put in a market order if the stop limit is reached

Yop, absolute garbage. We will see I might do same. How does it actually work when you switch to different bank? They transfer all your investments with same buy-ins, same share count etc.? When you have it in TFSA/RRSP it's not gonna count as new contributions, right?

I hope to make back what I spent on the calls tbh, not really hoping to make back my losses on PLTR as a whole. I’m down about $500 at the current moment due to PLTR’s dip, and my pool is only 2k in right now (down to $1500, was up to $2300 a week after putting this money in, by playing it safe).
In that it's vastly safer? Waymo in Phoenix operates without any driver behind the wheel, it's a full level 4 system. It's also testing in much more challenging locations such as Michigan winters.

A lot of people here are not motivating you or encouraging you for your amazing gains. People like you should be very proud of this and cash it out so that you can buy PLTR dip so that it pops a little and I can get out with -39% instead of -40%.

The fact that you need pre-existing relationships and massive AUM at banks to participate in hot IPOs is just another one of a million ways that the deck is stacked in favor of those who already have wealth to accumulate more at an exponential rate.

If your next comment isn’t “I’m giving my brother the full $1300, and I’m sorry to karma for testing her” then I will block you. If you read through my comments and posts you will find out that you have a lot to gain by giving your brother the $1300. I plan to release monthly posts on how to: with my next one including basic terminology and strategies(previous was about a wedge trading tactic and market psychology). Again, karma is the greatest Queen to have lived and please don’t offend her. Do the right thing, and give your brother the full $1300 and tell your brother to learn how to invest it himself. It would be more beneficial for you to work together in the future and share your trading theories and strategies.

I meant to reply to the message above yours (I hate mobile lol). The 30% means a lot because the consoles are guaranteed to sell out for the foreseeable future, meaning the larger share of consoles they get the larger number of customers they will get. No one will buy new consoles without picking up ancillary items to go with them, those ancillary items are what provide profits. Additionally, you are more likely to return to the company you bought things from for related items. So if GME sells someone a console, they are likely to get other gaming items from GME in the future since they sign people up for the rewards program.

PLTR puts?
That poster just isn't aware of the actual dollar amounts involved. Spoilers: Tesla *might* be able to justify their current - as in today - valuation if they manufactured 100% of all vehicles on earth and controlled 40% of the global energy storage and distribution markets. 

It will be a colossal failure on the part of every single vehicle manufacturer and energy company today if Tesla even makes it to 15% market share in either of these segments.
Did same on a100 shares during the last pump. Kept profits too.

Not exactly sure what you mean. Options are more complicated and stressful and you’re a lot more likely to lose money and fast. As long as you don’t pick garbage stocks they’ll always have some value where as options can go to 0 in a day or two

Once the door closes behind her, your nose is filled with the stench of what you'd just done. Not for the first time, you regret being unable to afford one of the climate controlled storage units that circulate air.

You absentmindedly walk over to the ironing board where the last of your clothes hang and pull on a stained t-shirt. It's still a bit damp. Because you can't afford the laundromat, you've been sneaking into the park at night and handwashing your clothes in a stream. Last night, a couple of kids who were smoking weed had stumbled upon you, and your head and heart had filled with their confused laughter as you ran away.

You look again at the only other thing in this storage unit, your mattress, and you can taste the toxic poison of regret in your mouth as you remember what got you into this position. Arrogance and calls. Blind conviction that a mattress company was stronger than a global recession. You lost everything, but out of pity, your now-ex-wife told the judge that you could see your kids on some weekends. But you haven't exercised the privilege once in months. Not since you moved into here. You couldn't survive the anguish if they found out--if they knew their father washes his clothes in a stream at night, when no one can see him.
You do be speaking fax doe.

Let’s say there is a large bid-ask spread on an option, like SHOP where it’s around 400 for 12/11 contracts. Is there a way that a poor retard like me can make money off it?
Robinhood is a good broker, change my mind

Send me your positions and I’ll say
I wish there was a way to help setup more young people to guarantee future success in life. If only there was a Government-funded education system that could teach ‘Finance 101’ instead of lowering the standard testing ‘pass/fail’ line year after year to slowly create a less intelligent populous, that is more easily controlled and persuaded. 🤫

I think it’s always a god strategy to trim as it goes up and then at some point leave everything to ride when it’s all profits. Do that with a $1k trade and it’s good practice when you do that $100k trade
Holy fuck this is the most retarded bullshit. Basically you're saying "careful, stocks are about to go down unless they go up!!"

My friends LOVE Dallas and want to move back there and are trying to convince us to follow them.  

No state income tax....3x property tax.  

For a household in a high tax bracket in Maryland with a 7 figure house, it was a wash buying a similar place in the Dallas suburbs.
The point is that statistically speaking if you make a shit load of money off an option it’s because you *were the statistical anomaly*.  I just want everyone in WSB to recognise they could lose it all in a second and hedge appropriately
I don’t think they can tell you to cut your hair. If you keep it clean and bunned you should be fine. It’s a pretty common style these days, workplaces should be accepting of it

What the fuck those charts don’t fucking matter.
unfortunately it just doesn’t happen, move to stocks trust me. Keep your portfolio 90/10 stocks - options imo. thats still a lot to mess around with as well as recognizing gains

Bad vibes, religiously unholy

It took 8 years for the S&P to recover to its previous ATH after the dotcom bubble. It took 6 years for the S&P to recover to its previous ATH after the real estate bubble. There’s a reason everyone didn’t pile into 2 years leaps in the March crash.

So it comes down to whether you believe the Corona recovery is the new normal or an extreme fluke. And are you willing to be your savings on that answer?
People in this sub either don’t understand options at all or are gamblers and don’t care and just want to yolo.

Desktop platform is actually pretty decent. You can go into the company's detailed financial when you view the stock ticker related to it so it's good for doing research. They also show you forex, commodities and futures although I think you need to upgrade your account to trade those. They also have a good screener.

However, if your a technical trader, the charts and graphs lack detail. It's actually frustrating for me because I couldn't get the charts to show.

Also don't get me started with the App, the UX is terrible and follows this weird Chinese design.
So China stocks are gonna get rocked on Monday, huh?

Actually I told my boss that I want to leave the job but this time the company is trying to keep the bussiness running and this is the hard time for this company due to the pandemic. I worked there for 3 years already and my boss ask me to stay with the company to pass this hard time 🥺
So I'm trying to establish better habits to become more knowledgeable about the market. It's clear you had a solid thesis in this play and it turned out to be correct, but my question for you is what were you reading/watching that eventually catalyzed your decision here? Did it just intuitively come to you to get against the conventional Wall Street wisdom on this sector? This obviously ain't no WSB meme stock lmao

I know you are hopeful, but it doesn't make business sense. If AMC is going down, anyone interested in it should wait until after they file for bankruptcy. That way the debt is wiped out (along with the investors) and Disney can get the assets for cheap. Advertising in theaters is not worth too much if people don't go there. The Warner Bros announcement was a hard blow to AMC. Others will follow suit.  Check their 5-year chart. It's not pretty.
that's a lot of ramen
Here I thought I was fancy for buying 100 shares of TSLA in May 2019 at $45.10. Small bet I know, but I was feeling good! Up 1228%.

Going to ruin someone's life i garuntee it !
😘
Say less babe
Just google high yield bond ETF’s 

Or google high yield REITS.

Do NOT buy REITS just for high dividends if their P/E is crazy. Rent is not a good market to be in rn
The argument was that there are a bunch of things that can go wrong and something as common  as a bird strike can bankrupt a company. You seem to lack the common sense in figuring out the inherent risk involved and that businesses know that doing business with billionaires isn’t profitable, but an LLC or INC business does not come back to you if it goes bankrupt. It is just part of doing business, and those businesses are usually run by billionaires with the expectation that it will be driven into the ground so the owners take advantage of the tax exemptions they can get from it. “I have 100 businesses and only 1 has to be successful” is the motto of billionaires and it stands true. Please feel free to quit responding unless you can expand your point of view to that of someone much richer than yourself.
Yeah but r/investing doesn't yolo deep otm calls on cvx. That's what separates the retards from the boomers.
Depends on how long you wait. 

I all in 500 on TTD IPO day. Turn into 13k
A top 10 by MCAP company so you know its price is totally stable! They'll definitely do it
prediction:

i buy a call and it goes up in value and i either sell it for minimal profit or after it tanks below $500, realizing a -$150+ loss and i forget about it, two years later i'm reminded that the call is now worth over $8000 and then i bitch about it to someone that doesn't care
Or gay 👀
Lmao is this a joke
10k is plenty but seeing that your chart shows you have no clue what the fuck you are doing dot com, you should just stick to selling your ass on the streets.
Anyone celebrating Christmas overseas? Assuimg most of yall are gringos (so am I) are from the US.

This will be my second consecutive Christmas in Peru.
Got 14k in good ol’ spy 372 calls for Wednesday.

Why are you judging them? You don’t understand it either. So shut the fuck up
You crawl into bed next to her. Slowly. You spent good money on this mattress, but it’s still loud, and you don’t want to wake her.

She mumbles to herself, and you fight back laughter. Since you began sharing a bed, you’ve learned to live with a sleep talker, but it still amuses you every time.

She moans, “No, don’t.” You can see stripes of light across her face, as the full moon spills through the slats in the blinds. You decide to play along. “Don’t what?”

“Buy that car.” You sit up at that, allowing the bed to creak. She continues, “It’s garbage.” You choke out the words, “What do you mean?”

She sleep chuckles, “It’s made in China.”

You stand, suddenly, but she still doesn’t wake. The light through the blinds paints your naked form like a sad, overweight zebra. And now a mental light shines on your sad, overweight NIO bags.

“Go back to sleep,” you say, and within moments you hear her gentle snore. But you won’t sleep tonight. Or ever again.
Ban again.

If you can afford 100 contracts , but see Tesla as just EV company. 

Do yourself a favour and go to r/investing. 

Also if you are new to this. Ignore condor and straddle. 

If you’re that insistent on still buying them: 

600 strike Dec 18. 
Sell Dec 15-17 

Have fun enjoy the ride.
When WSBs options on EV, PLTR, and GME expire OTM. Mods gotta bring back the baby Jeff Bezos mascot, it's what we deserve.
And if you held you’d recover. It’s not Exxon or GE. It just Had its IPO only retards on this sub are looking at it like it peaked. Besides Soros not one hedge fund started significantly decreasing their position.
I got this ice cream scoop designed by an aerospace engineer that scoops out ice cream with no effort straight out the freezer. The only problem is that you're then eating the ice cream 30 seconds after it came out the freezer and it makes your teeth hurt and you get that headache. Sometimes the easy way has unforeseen side effects or whatever that saying is. Like when you hit the 10 bagger but get overconfident and lose the gains on something retarded.
Sorry your capital won't beat spy over the next year you retarded meme bag holder

My ex-boss bought $200 worth of bitcoins 2010 and sold half of it two years ago making $7M. I thought that was pretty good. I remember him mentioning it to me and I always through few hundred here and there for Kickstarter stuff etc.but for whatever reason I didn’t do the same at the time. That means that he doesn’t need to work while I do. LOL.

Hey man I hope it fills the emptiness you feel inside
Right. And if (not likely, but IF) $GME rockets up to $30 before Dec. 11, then you just missed out on like $2,400 (300 shares x $8/per share appreciation).
Talking about a diff retard - scroll down a day or three. Is insane
Your entire thought process is dependent on whether employees and insiders sell or hold which is really the only thing to look at here. Snow could be up 400% and they wouldn’t sell at all if they are happy with the company, seeing first hand how things are going for the business and are well compensated that they don’t actually need the extra income. Unless you have some DD to say that employees are unhappy or under compensated then it’s very unlikely that would be the case. Management won’t sell after lockup because if they did at all it would be a massive signal that everyone else should bail out and then the rest of their ownership, all their hard work and future potential would be worthless instantly. I’ve been an employee for a well known tech company as it was going through a similar phase. Employee purchase plans and rsu grants are a good way to keep employees invested in the business, lower net value leaving the business through wages and give the employees a better retirement future or home purchase option than something like a pension plan would.

All their cash is doing is keeping them afloat. There's no shot they can compete with predominantly online retailers unless they completely revamp their entire model. Their brick and mortar stores rely half on games, half on trinkets. The only reason that people go to gamestop is when their aunt/grandparents get them a gift card. With Amazon offering games, at a cheaper price, game stop is a dying breed

I love RKT. I just don’t know if I trust it. I don’t see anyone lending right now even though real estate is hot. My friend couldn’t get a loan and went from his dream home to a condo he could buy in cash. He has a stable job and a good credit score, but he couldn’t guarantee his job would be around in five years from the pandemic
Bro market literally fucking fell and rose 10% in November. It's only been a couple weeks. Buckle up

Compare to how much it “could spike” 


Consider this:  had you not bought this earlier, would you buy spend 5k on weeklies the coming Monday? If not.. sell 

If so. Hold.
Nope. No news soon. I'll hit you up in 2 months when it's probably still near NAV. Good luck

I don't totally disagree - it would be a small win for AMC holders for an orderly takeover though.
Snap?
It’s exactly why
Holy Fuck!
Snap?
Never.
Sure you insulate yourself from a dip but you could also miss out on the biggest part of the spike if we get some very positive news.

IMO with GME the potential upside far outweighs the potential downside so it's a solid buy/hold.

I’ve always wanted to own a stock with a negative cost basis. I think RKT will be it
Umm I meant for like a couple weeks tops while I wait for some dips I like lol relax
This is the way
This is pharma, so don't load up on options unless there is a clear catalysts to drive the price up like expected trail results occurring before you expiration date. EDIT is mainly pre clinical at the moment, except for 1 phase 1/2 trial. Time your plays around those dates.
Imagine seeing +500k tanking to +250k and not getting the fuck out...that's still a lot of resolve to hold through
Have you got your free stock?

Going all in 2 yr leaps on the next one no joke
What the fuck Lmaoo... when did you buy this?
That guy was fake?
I think the numbers we see don't take into account selling calls or puts either. Just selling shares, which may be a small percentage of the total short.

You're obviously trashing GME without doing any research. 30% of the console allotment.
Maybe not 40k though....20 x $23
300% on $5 is only $15
no risk then no reward most likely. I like 5-10% risk for 2x, 3x gain.
This time tomorrow you're all gonna be screaming about -0.38% or cumming your undies over +0.12% and I'm just gonna be sitting here like can someone please finally tell me where I can look at futures?
You fucked up the $ sign in total gains otherwise 10/10 good work
Because fuck you, that's why.
"The [United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Antitrust_Division) began a review of antitrust decrees that did not have expiration dates. In 2019, the DOJ sought to terminate the Paramount Decrees, which would include a two-year sunset period as to the practices of block booking and circuit dealing to allow theater chains to adjust. The Department stated it was "unlikely that the remaining defendants can reinstate their cartel" as reasoning for terminating the decrees.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.#cite_note-10) The DOJ formally filed its motion for a court order to terminate the decrees on November 22, 2019.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.#cite_note-11) The move was opposed by [independent movie theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_movie_theater) owners, including the Independent Cinema Alliance, and independent filmmakers.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.#cite_note-:0-9)

The court granted the DOJ's motion to lift the decrees on August 7, 2020, starting a two-year [sunset termination period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision) of the decrees.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.#cite_note-12)"

That would be deep. Cinema vs. Cinema...
Please, explain how GME and Blockbuster are the same. 

Blockbuster had an insanely bad balance sheet and was losing a ton of money every quarter before it went bye bye. GME has more cash than debt, is cash flow positive, and is entering a new console cycle while also working to improve margins by closing stores and pushing more customers online...
If I bought leaps instead of shares during the crash I would have 10x what I made. fuck
Then why are you asking
PLTR TO THE MOOOOON!!!!
You can choose other arbitrary thrill seeking activities that are inherently dangerous, if I'd known you would perseverate on those examples I would not have chosen bungee jumping or sky diving. 

Do all these companies know that it is not profitable to allow billionaires to use their services? This information seems worth sharing.

If you think I’m going broke you should go ahead and check my post/comment history. I make making money look like a hobby instead of a day job. Again, check my post and comment history and you will see you’re barking up the wrong tree. For some reason I don’t think you would lie over Reddit, but I will block you so you can’t view my future comments or posts unless you agree to give your brother the full $1300 and tell him to learn to invest him damn self(start on stocks before moving to options). I take honor seriously and it is unhonorable to charge your brother a fee for your mistakes when he had the risk of losing it all unknowingly.
Run by the guy who made SPY. That's it lol
But it may spike pretty high Thursday into Friday from the vaccine getting approved, considering I only put $340 into this call it seems like theta may be worth taking the hit on if it spikes

You clearly need to fucking negotiate if you are still paying more than a fraction of a % for VISA transactions, numb nuts.
Would that mean all your shares on AMC would be cashed out?
They posted very strong revenue growth of 61% yoy for Q3. I think those acquisitions are really paying off and the pandemic merely accelerated the streaming/gaming trend. 

I am tuning out the meme stock noise. The valuation is low for a company staring at ~1.6B in revenue in FY2020 and growing at the rate they are. They have an opportunity to cement their brand in the streaming/gaming space and I think if they are able to execute on that they have a very bright few years ahead. 

I do agree that the red is hard to watch, but it’s looking like a fairly standard correction and consolidation at this point given the run up.
Fun 2020 fact: 22% of the USD’s in circulation were ‘created’ this year... in 5 months. 🤔 Nothing to see here.

Lordstown Motors (RIDE) $40c Jan 2023 right now are about $6.50 premium. They're planning on releasing their all electric trucks next year in 2021.

If that company is worth 5% of Tesla's market cap in the next 2 years then that call will be worth over $16,000 just from intrinsic value
bro sell that shit right now...

dude not much good news surrounding uber lately (california lawsuit/regulation, layoffs) but it keeps grinding up to ATH. Got me some 1/15 calls
Most recent rumors are closing down this company since the other 2 owners are all canablizing each other, or at least sectioning off which regions to sell in. Might be a good bet or not, but I wouldn’t bet on this horse in the long run from what I have read and seen lately
imagine homeless people recently homeless looking to this place for a glimmer of hope that they could throw 300 bucks on something make it 400 by eow and they read my fucking stupid comments , im sorry everyone i have failed you

Shits trash. Fucks up your nose and lessens the effect
23% is way too steep for nothing to show for it besides Ackman. Looks like Fu se doesn't have anything either.
I’m deciding to invest long term in either arkg or crispr. I do think gene editing will be the future and I’d like to extend my life if possible through it someday.
Ah. You're one of those folks. Got it.

Crispr is a VERY cheap and VERY simple technology to manufacture. You can literally do it yourself in your home for less than $1000 of equipment, and less than $100 of consumables. You can buy kits online right now. 

Tesla lets others use their patents, but the end product is different. Crispr is crispr, it’s not going to vary much company to company. I’m not even sure if Individual therapeutics can be patented because the there is a huge debate on if DNA can be patented.

The biggest profitability sector I see long term is in personalized cancer therapy, not curing rare diseases. They can charge tens of thousands for an individual cure, but if a dozen of companies are curing sickle cell for pennies to manufacture, it’ll drive down the price.

But I’m learning now that by the time they become profitable, it is usually too late or you have missed a large chunk of the gains and quick money. The time to buy is exactly now while they look like a dumpster fire.

The truth is they have “brand appeal” and trusted name. Just like AAPL and TSLA. It is the current leader in taxis. It’ll pull through. Sector leaders always do.

How tf did u do this
Yes in this case, it’s called time decay, contracts will gradually lose value every day it moves closer to the Expiration date and the strike doesn’t seem within reach, so it has value but like no smart investor is going to take on the risk and buy those calls from him imo, they’ll most likely end up expiring worthless

Tbh. I think uber as a mid-term investment (2-5 years) is pretty solid.

It will go up and possibly triple 3 years from now. And then get crushed like a soufflé when TSLA finally pushes out their autonomous taxi network. But even then it will be slow bc regular people will NOT trust that shit regardless what TSLA fanboys say.

For sure growth is king now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get nice profits on value.  And growth always stalls eventually.. so much priced into these growth companies they’re only setup for a letdown, they were good buys two/three years ago or in March but they’re topping out.  

You just saw it with Splunk, they missed earnings by a couple million or whatever and their stock goes down 25% in one day, so you lose all gains for the year in a day.

I think they will have another great Q4. They will make lot of money from BiitCoiin volatility because they charge some percentage for selling and buying on Cash App. Their 50 million investment in shiitCoiin doubled which means they hold more cash.

Given how manic this market is, and given how other SPACs have gone up 150%+ since merger announcement (cig merger group is an example, can't use the ticker or automod will block the comment), I don't think it's crazy to assume $40+.

I can’t disagree that it sounds very far OTM but you could by a Jan 21 10C for Nio in march when Nio was trading under $1.50. Thats 900% OTM with less than a year of time. These were 18 months out and 300%.

Watch *The China Hustle*
Agreed. I’ve already got some vertical put credit spreads for mid December at 37/38. So, if it stays above 38 I win.   The money I foresee myself making from that is funding mid jan 49/50 debit call spreads (which I also already have).  So over 50 I win.  The entire play will make me about 100% of total risk if successful.   Looking through analysts ratings and wondering if I should be betting bigger on what seems like an obvious easy win.  Currently risking about 7% of portfolio.

everyone does. this is a ridiculous question.
do you mind telling us what stock u bet on?
Fml, you right.
I think the odds on Roulette is better. Put $100 on red and hope to double your money. If it goes on black and you lose. Put $200 to break even. Keep doubling up until you profit.
A FUCKING WINNER!
Agree, but if there’s an overreaction after earnings call, I could see it breaking through to $12. Personally not worried either way.
Fucking low risk my ass. This shit is ~30% above NAV. I have a good amount in it, but it is not low risk

Now F U S E which I have 10k IS low risk.

Throwing $500 at a lottery ticket isn't the craziest thing, but holding onto that ticket when it's worth $100k in the hopes that it will continue to gain value? That's the crazy shit right there. Also not freaking out when your $100k lottery ticket drops to $10k in value. I'd have an easier time believing someone did this by forgetting about a trade rather than watching it miraculously keep going up and never selling.

Im not shorting, I'm looking to buy calls. People will short this because they are technically an airline, and at their current \~6.8B valuation, they are worth more than many other airlines live SAVE that actually have flights and make money. I think the test flight will happen, its supposed to be sunny and clear in NM. 

They represent a lot more than just an airline in that their jets will be going to space, its the tourism and gov contracts that come with access space that makes sense. They can also do supersonic transcontinental flights to, etc, etc. Anyway, enjoy the ride. They want a 1/4M for one seat on a space flight (and they sell these), a standard commercial airliner can't get that kind of revenue from a whole plane of tickets... consider that too.

Again, then how does a private jet company stay in business? Wouldn't billionaires fly on private jets? It seems this would be a problem for cars, planes, and anything that could result in a billionaire's death. How is this problem unique to Virgin Galactic as opposed to the operator of a super yacht, limousine, or private jet? You'd think they'd never be allowed to skydive or bungee jump either if the operator could be "on the hook" for future earnings.

Maybe when it drops below 20 to get in again..maybe. But sounds even more risky than a TSLA for eg.
These kinds of opportunities are basically arbitrage, and they never last. Anyone who promises "consistent profits" based on this kind of strategy is a fool. There is no free lunch. 

The only consistent edge one can have is the ability to analyze A) how much X is worth and B) how much the market thinks X is worth accurately.  And then profit when A and B are misaligned, as they will eventually converge.

The “short“ percentage of every stock is published twice a month and is listed in every stock’s info page. 

GME has an unusually high amount, actually more than the number of shares because some were likely counted twice ( shares changed hands during the count). It’s just a matter of time until the shorts start buying to cover their losses. They were not planning for the stock to increase.

The premium on that call recently peaked at $45.60

$3 into $4560 is the highest return I could find lol. There was a big window to sell the call for over $3000 if you just held for 13 months

An analyst on the earnings call actually asked a headcount question — about why the YoY headcount growth was only 5% (or a number close to this I can’t recall exactly). The response was that Palantir has learned to be more efficient with its existing set up and I think that’s a fair answer. But also a fair question! People are trying to measure up the company and these are traditionally the variables used in making that assessment. But yeah, I agree that analysts haven’t exactly wrapped their hands around the company or its outlook.

[“After the close of trading on Monday, Nov. 16, the S&P committee at last announced that TSLA will be added to the S&P 500 index on Dec. 21. Approximately 120 million shares will have to be bought by passive S&P 500 index funds. Then there is an unknowable yet very significant number of “closet indexers” who will have to decide whether they will buy TSLA for their index tracking purposes or effectively short TSLA just by omitting it from their S&P 500 tracking portfolios. Portfolio managers who have not taken the time to study Tesla’s unique business case thoroughly are now being forced to do so in order to decide whether to buy it.”](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/tesla-stock-could-hit-800-on-s-p-500-inclusion-fund-manager-says-heres-how-hes-trading-it-51606838814)

Ahh, dang! So close. I too am an 818.
you do know that technology is is region locked.... it can only drive in pre-recorded areas. but you keep telling yourself that technology will beat Tesla lol

We all started with the quarters jar and promises to only invest what we earn. 


Then the taste of success sets in. Just a little taste.

Then few months after that you're trading your loss reports for internet points.

Yep if it runs prior and I can get out for break even or small profit, I'm selling majority and only letting 1 or 2 ride through lol if it doesn't run prior then I'm holding them all through lol

Why do people think wall street bets is a trading forum

99/100 have no idea what wall street bets does or what it is. And what they do isn't even that special. They just hear the words "buy this retards" and jizz themselves over the tendies? Or is it because of the memes?

And even if they were the best in class in their theoretical trades, that's not even a lot of tendies.

They couldn't possibly be the next /r/stocks or /r/investing.

[deleted]
both. ark is in the middle of a takeover battle, never put all your chips in one basket
Nah, this is what you want. If they post good earning this week, a buying frenzy starts, the more people that participate the higher it goes. Place your bets before hand.
You are correct in the total risk is 80 cents per contract, each contract is 100 shares though so it will be 80$ total for one contract. Total risk to lose is 80$ and total potential gain is unlimited.
what do you think is the target if it’s not Stripe?
Positions?
Thank you
I think you are right
Lol close by, Sherman oaks.
Yeah it’s all the same bullshit. I just mentioned Facebook because I only see people on there as opposed to big accounts on Twitter/Instagram/snap
Too late to get into crspr or wait for a dip?
Do you have insurance? If your policy covers $2.5b in damages but you kill an up and coming billionaire like Elon who has been earning an average of x-billion dollars per year and their family sued you for $3.5b and can prove he would’ve made that over his lifetime in addition to damages, well you’re on the hook for 1b.      

Getting sued by billionaires is a lot more different because not only is someone’s life valued based on how much they would’ve made in the future, their family likely has the kind of money to hire the best team of law firms. Not one law firm like a broke ass Trump.
Nope. And RKT is a great company just the chart is poop

Yet it's a great company and has the fundamentals. Chart is poop tho
But sometimes they do hit me hard.

That's the frustrating part - nothing gets me more blazed... Just only like 10% of the time...

Make sure you research the stock thoroughly and understand their price targets and have analysts supporting your idea.

Right now with 23 analysts ratings that I see, they have 22% saying to buy, 61% saying to hold, 17% saying to sell.

Consider all factors and don't place bets that make you feel anxious. You should feel confident entering a trade and confident knowing when to exit as well.

Panic is not good for decisions so don't make any crazy bets or they usually end badly.
Im talking about tech. Buying a money losing manufacturer is a totally different story.
It won’t dip post earning. They have a huge announcement 🚀🚀🚀😎

How many autists are buying pltr leaps on Monday thinking they will turn $500 into a mil in 1-2 years 😂
Hey friend, do you have Robinhood? Enable options trading, and sell 5 covered calls at $19. RH shows these options will bring you $148 each, meaning you bring in enough to lower your cost basis by $.75 per share or $17.5.

Then, if gme goes to the moon, you will exit half your position for a profit of $1,250 and have 500 shares you can ride all the way up. If gme  goes down or stays stagnant, you lowered your cost basis to $17.5/share, which is only $.5 from the current price anyways. Repeat next week to bring your shares to even.

You held on for the risk part of the trade and you are about to bail right before the reward. Hold on till January, you will not be disappointed.

Using the method I mentioned above, I have lowered my cost basis on 1000 shares and 31 calls to $3.9/share. Get those 💎 🙌 ready 😎😎🤷‍♀️

As the end of the year nears, let us not lose perspective over what’s happened the last nine months. Over a million people worldwide have lost their lives to a new disease.  Nearly 300,000 people alone in the US. That’s 300,000 people who will never see their children or grandkids again. Millions lost their loved ones, grandparents, parents, and even children — and are now in mourning, wrapped in sadness and grief.

Today, Think of those less fortunate than you, who are now unable (due to death) or too depressed to download a shitty trading app and pick up a few shares of GME. Just think if each of them had bought just 10 shares last week we would be in the midst of an epic infinity squeeze, instead of praying for some miracle with earnings.

What do you think about LAZR (Luminar technologies)? All other companies except Tesla uses LiDAR tech for self driving. Elon thinks LiDAR is stupid and unnecessarily expensive. If LiDAR is not what Elon thinks then I believe LAZR is a potential 5x or 10x stock.
Im up 1500% on my COP 1/15 40 calls since election day.  Everyone is busy chasing EV, Weed and cloud stocks, meanwhile there’s tons of value being overlooked.

Put it this way, COP made $33B rev and $7B net income in 2019 on a $47B market cap.  Whether you hate oil or not, anyone with biz sense can realize this is incredible value.  

Twilio has a $50B market cap, more than COP, and possibly will never make $7B net income, they might never even make a profit. Best they can hope is that they get bought out before someone eats their tech and they go obsolete, but people will keep chasing these stocks even though most have missed the boat and their valuations now will continue to disappoint every earnings report.

You obviously don't understand the mechanics behind the stock market, stock indicies, and in this case most importantly stock index funds.

So you belong right here spouting out nonsense.  you are probably and NPC too.

One more time...  I'll try to dumb it down for you.  I'll assume your gender is female, as your logic so far seems to be quite feminine at this point.

Ask yourself this question.  How much stock is the S&P committee purchasing in Tesla, as you obviously think, before opening bell Dec 21?

Ha Ha.  Wrong answer.  The correct answer is ZERO.  It has always been zero.  The committee owns zero fucking stocks.  The index is a freaking spreadsheet, thats it.   On Monday morning, they will literally erase the line containing the company they are removing, and adding Tesla in it's place.  That will take about .2 microseconds.  And ta da!  The index now includes Tesla at the opening bell, at the EOD price from friday.

It is the stock market funds, the index funds to be precise, who have to physically go out and buy TSLA stock in the amounts that will balance their portfolios to account for TSLA to be about 1.4% of their holdings.  These funds will sell some of their other shares to be able to buy what they have to in TSLA.  This will happen over a period of 8 to 10 days centered around the 21.
wowww YC crew knows what’s up. fintech company trying to have morals 🙄 please
Wtf. Were you short SPX?
No idea what margin impact means. Max loss for a sold put is if stock goes to zero. Max loss for a sold call is theoretically unlimited.

In reality neither are likely to happen assuming you aren't selling on retarded shit like NKLA.

If your gay bear DD plays out you will have some tendies to play with. Honestly though, it’s a trash drug. Way better things to spend your money on in the black market
When you buy options the worst case scenario is losing your $500 premium. Same as going to the casino.

When you sell options there are scenarios where you lose money you don't have. Same as being the casino.

I just want to thank you for making me less dumb. I am still risking half the balance on options but I canceled the deposit to my brokerage and reduced it by half. If I fuck up I can use Christmas money to pay the rest. But thanks you most likely saved me some stress lol

spy puts around the vaccine approval meeting?
I remember when the stock sold off, Cramer tried to pump it back up. The gap could fill yeah, and volume rising. Could be a nice play
Maybe, I’m just so split on how the SP reacts to Q3 ER. Although it seems a bad ER is priced in, I’m sure shorts will still play it off as bad and continue shorting while paper hands sell. I would be fine with either possibilities tbh. If we get a decent ER and SP spikes, I’d assume some shorts will start coverings and more people would start buying. I’d just end up averaging up my shares which I don’t really mind but the options premiums would skyrocket and I want to get it for cheap (I had Jan 15 30c calls for .35 that I bought during that consolidation period but sold at around 2.22 on Tuesday). If we dip, I’d average down my shares and buy some April calls then be able to chill.
I’ll shoot a tail to that
Not the place to ask for new advice friendo

That sounds like the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard and I’ve heard some dumb ass things at the liquor store. Do your brother a favor and give him the $1300 and tell him to learn how to invest in the stock market himself. Based on your trades I would not trust you with a dime of my money. CCL was 100% a stroke of luck where you were able to catch a wave. You seem like a buy high sell low kind of guy. Options aren’t for you.

Biden can’t stop a debt bubble that’s ten years in the making. Only if they can fast-track student debt forgiveness and a stimulus that covers people’s rent for the past 10 months will they have enough time to unwind this bubble. But it will still cause the market to fall. Either the market falls quickly or slowly, depends on what Biden can pull off.
Tsla is exactly the kind of stock you don't want to sell covered calls on. You want to capture any gainns from a large move up.
Nope
Why was I blocked for asking this?
I'm 36, and I'm not wearing rose tinted glasses.

Parents around me are working harder and earning less than their parents, yet still raising kids that manage to function even though most of them don't function that well because of their own upbringing. Entitlement if I've ever heard of it really.

Did both of your parents work full time jobs or multiple jobs from the time they were 18 until retirement? Yeah neither did mine, one income was enough to support our family with 5 kids.

Sacrifices. The magical sacrifices are always alluded to as being the things that made the things possible, but no one mentions what those sacrifices were. It's just more moaning. "You should pity only meeee! No one else deserves any credit or sympathy, just meeee!" Since these sacrifices that were made can't be identified, let's put them on the scale of capitalism and look at what younger generations are sacrificing right now compared to what their parents sacrificed.

Yep, millennials and zoomers have factually paid an order of magnitude more in sacrifices than their predecessors.

Easy like in the old times eh? Better get back in your history books, this nation was built on the backs of immigrants, and only thrives when the borders are leaking like a sieve. Population has nothing to do with it, if it did, China wouldn't be replacing us as the world's largest economy.

Quite the opposite actually.

This was me on Friday and now I'm down to my last fucking $600 again. Fun times. See you at the bottom, retard.
I am unclear on how this insurance policy would be so cost prohibitive for Virgin Galactic but not for every other company insuring aircrafts. The logic was that hitting a bird would bankrupt the company. Didn't that guy on the potomac hit a whole flock of geese without bankrupting the company. It's because it is billionaires? How do private jet companies operate? I think the bird insurance logic is flawed and I don't buy it.

So is this buying 594 call options with strike price $130 on 19 feb 21.

If SP goes $130 or beyond before that date, you’re in the money? If stays below that they pretty much expire worthless?

Sorry I don’t do options normally. I just don’t know how they value options like this as would think if not in the money the gain would always be a negative value, and if it never hits strike price, all you’ll lose is the premium, which isn’t anywhere near the states loss atm of $40k, am incorrect?

Thanks for the advice, I really don't want to paper hand it, but almost every comment I've seen on WSB is someone with a better position than me (hearing a lot of 16s-17s) and I was just wondering if there is a way for me to get to a better position in the short term.
I think it is possible that it spikes Wednesday instead if there is good guidance and many people will be in FOMO mode. IMO not worth selling shares ahead of ER and missing out. Better to sell puts or calls while IV is highest.
Long long term probably

The longest otm option right now is $1,200 C expires 1/20/2023 and that would still cost you $11k.

This was just incredible.
Best moves: Not selling snapchat

Worst moves: Canceling $7 PLUG call leap for january which would have netted me 28k

Nice job.  I recall your JWN call.  I’ve been so engrossed in PLTR that I completely missed it.  I have 5500 shares of PLTR that took diamond hands to hold.  It must have been hard to hold JEN options this so long.  Kudos to you.  Good point on conviction.
How often does this play pay
Really, the only one that still mention RKT are disgruntled bagholders (myself included). But, even then, it's not worth it. I'm just waiting for my year end 22c calls to expire.
WSB at this hour Saturday night is for super nerds and drunks. Currently omyw to being the latter.

Hmm, like say if you remove the prospect of a squeeze, I might get real nervous if it goes down to 10, and might just sell so that I can use the money on something else, instead of bagholding.

You do realize that small/medium/large market capitalization is a set definition and defined range right? Its not some arbitrary number that changes just because a stock got bigger. 

Thank you for your link actually. Im the dumb one, I cant believe I said Tesla was a medium market cap stock. Tesla was actually considered a large market cap stock when he bought it. So your link just makes you look even more stupid. 


> Not with that attitude. Like I just said before you sperged out, there's always trades like this to be made.

I never said there isnt, but there will never ever again be a leap you can get for a 20$ on a medium market cap stock. If you think there is, then you dont understand option pricing plain and simple.

if my premium earned is $330 and my margin impact is $460, does that mean my max loss is $130? Also, why do some stocks have such low premium but higher max losses? Does it have to do with IV? (e.g 155 premium but 713 margin impact)

What are you guys doing right now?
Yeah, except its Tesla. Plenty of people saw the run to 1200 coming, not a lot saw the run to 2000 and split coming. But Tesla was always good for this kinda move. A lottery ticket is random and the odds are pretty poor, always. With options you can get quite a bit of info before you buy. It's a lot less luck-based for someone to have realized that Tesla hype has fuck all to do with their cars and its only a matter of time before the market realizes this, than it is for someone to make this same return on lotto.
That’s a good thing coke is the most over hyped drug there is

Chewy is a vastly different business than a Gamestop. They've got a business model that clearly differentiates itself from it's competitors (even seemingly dumb things like sending a professionally pained picture of an owner's let on  their birthday).

 People frequently go to the big box stores for all sorts of things including gaming systems. What competitive advantage does Gamestop have? Why would I make a special trip there when it's just as easy to buy a system/game at a store I'm already going to and who will just price match whatever Gamestop offers?

What is wsb's fascination with RKT. You people jump from 1 meme on to the next without a second thot but RKT for some reason just keeps getting mentioned all the time when it stays flat for months.
PLTR can do that in 2 weeks
If that energy is there I really dont get how Citron alone can do us in like that... All these memes talk a big game but it hasn't held water. He can just call his institution friends and theyll just dump their efforts into shorting it. Once they're satisfied and they turn their backs to PLTR that's when it will go up

Impossible. PLTR is actually a tech company, RKT is just a mortgage company.
Lol I’m the one being called demeaning when the other guy is calling him a pussy. This is reality buddy. There are people who need that $600. Notice I didn’t say every bartender. I hope PLTR can get as high as the horse you’re sitting on.

if you were talking about January calls or something, yeah i would tell you to panic. But you have shares. At current price, it's still valued at 0.15x of TTM revenues because the market is still not appreciating what the massive share buybacks last year means
The spacing increase would ALSO apply between the 2 and the 3. Not just the . And the 2.

Honestly I try to stay away from shorting a stock. I imagine successfully shorting a stock is probably the best big brain high there is, so like any other drug, I’d rather not try it, I don’t want to be chasing that high. I’m just not that talented to be able to short. Also I kinda already short stocks in a away, if you think about it, by not being invested in them and ignoring them, you’re creating a mental short that allows space for other ideas to flow.

Diamond hands the fuck outta this shit and if you really really want, create trailing limits that are around your cost basis (after GME passes 18.23), in which case, if it keeps going out, your paper handed ass won't FOMO again. Also you really shouldn't be dumping 18,230 bucks into a stock that you're going to paper hand

Cool just in time for the three biggest years of cloud migrations well ever aee
I think the vaccine approval this week will be a massive sell the news event and retail will get left holding the bag.  All the banks are selling the spy 400 headlines meanwhile VXX/Spy correlation combined with massive open interest on 12/18 puts (while broad put volume is minuscule) says SPY - 10%.
one is the market leader in an industry with a TAM of \~$134b with like an 8% CAGR and the other is a short squeezed relic of the early 2000s gaming industry with the backing of Burry. And you're talking shares- literally cannot go boobies skyward.
I didn’t say there was a penalty.

The S&P committee made it fucking clear they’re not buying in batches, they’re doing it at once. If you want to insist otherwise you can be just as retarded as OP for selling just before the S&P adds the largest market cap in their history to their index. Totally makes sense for this sub.

PLTR$ 200$ per share EOM
The big thing about TSLA is that everyone knows what it is and what it does. Big, flashy electric cars. Retail investors can be like ‘this is the future’ and FOMO into it

Meanwhile, PLTR? Nobody knows what it does and nobody outside of trading sites gives a shit about it. It’s like a worse RKT, except even less understandable and without a meme name.
What strike price did you buy? $680?

It’s actually because you’re a low life retard who hangs out on Reddit and you have a bear thesis. Then there’s millionaire and billionaire hedge fund managers who are extremely bullish on it. Reddit cuck or the 1% who should we listen to?
some big dog or most likely an instituion pulled their money out of the fund. the amount equals to 4% of the 172$ billion fund.
Yea they will pump OXY. XLE, GUSH will do well. Just take profits sooner than later.
They’re less effective on some people and it depends on a variety of factors like how much you smoke/take edibles, your weight, if you’ve eaten recently, and honestly I think it varies in general sometimes, but if you’re home making them make sure you’re mixing your ingredients sufficiently to get an equal distribution throughout the batch - on a side note, I think some people just aren’t affected nearly as much as some other people for some reason, I had a friend who smoked occasionally who once ate 225mg and was just really high, nothing crazy

Parents in my generation (I’m 33) are worse parents than previous generations.  

Being born without internet and where the internet is now is light years apart. The fact you wouldn’t consider this makes everything you say questionable. It’s the same with any breakthrough in how we live our life’s, the scope is just greater 

Entitlement is real, passed on from parents to children and spread through social media now.  The children not fully understanding the sacrifices made by their parents for each iteration as it snowballs. 

Anecdotally, My parents were dirt poor. I’m not. The only way I could do this was hard work, find a niche, create something that generates profit. So I will never buy that entitlement is a wound cry of boomers.  Anti entitlement is a shitty retort by people looking to pass blame.

My brother gave me a thousand dollars to invest for him last Friday. I put it into 1 month PLTR calls  but literally 5 minutes later the stock started its collapse. Then I pulled out and bought NIO, which also started collapsing. I instantly wiped off 300 dollars and had to think of something else. 

I then settled on buying 3 Csrnival calls for April and I turned 700 dollars into 1300. My brother doesn’t know I lost any money at first. For all he knows I turned 1000 into 1300 and that should be enough for him. 

Unfortunately trying to help him,  I fucked myself over and now I’m banned from trading
Right there with you. My retarded ass decided to try my first Call with a 40c 12/11. I wish there was a 2021 after that... but hey now I know what not to do.

Great post. I’m going to probably sell half my shares on Tuesday (I’m mostly all in), then buy the dip a day or maybe 2 days after ER, maybe Thursday morning I’m not sure. I’m hoping that there is a nice discount on the April calls after IV crush so that I could buy the April 20c or even the 30c.
I’m sorry. Just take a deep breath and everything will be okay.

I'm new and trying to learn trading. I had a question. I hear all the time about PLTR (PALANTIR) and am interested in buying long term shares (not those calls that you expire within a week that i've seen). So let's say i see a downward trend for the day and they are at 12$ (example), If i buy 200 shares at 12$ (2400$) and then i see a week later they are at 15$, could i sell my 200 shares for 15$ each minus the fees for using the app?

It’s actually only 439% return , if he is going to exercise them.
Nonetheless, good return.
Why the fuck does the market have to close on weekends
BABA for sure. It will go back up eventually. It’s a solid undervalued company with a lot of US institutional investment and they’re prepared for the auditing changes. Now would be a good time to buy imho because they are 50$ below their ATH. The stock randomly shoots up $30 in a week every couple months and I don’t think it’s going to go much lower than where it’s at now. I got five 1/15 $285c on Friday—not quite a leap but I think it’ll pay off. 

But with baba especially you want to make sure to sell them when you feel like it’s “high enough” because it’s so volatile with all of the politics. Or buy a few and sell enough to pay for the remaining contracts.

Depends on how many shares you have. Don't keep more than 20% of your entire portfolio in one stock is what I'd recommend. GME has earnings coming up this week and it could be -the- short squeeze, so I'm keeping 200 shares for the moment.

Great choice. I *love* this guy. I'm just starting to watch his videos. He has a way of making very complex things seem approachable to a moron like me ha ha.
I don't know. Like I said there's no clearly defining language, and CRA employees won't comment on enforcement policies much. They take the 'doing my job, I don't make the rules' rationale to extremes, but rarely ask the minister or finance committee for guidance. In that way, it takes a judicial order to fix badly written tax laws (or any other laws), but those are rare. And then you get more badly written revisions, because a judge cannot tell parliament what law to write; only that they must re-write or replace a bad law, and for what reason.

Thanks! Wow that guy has a lot of subs. Must be really good.
I thought about doing this. Leaps. Has it ever gone well for you? I was thinking SPCE and PAA
This will be my first year dealing with taxes for options so I am not sure about that. I think they are treated as capital gains just like stock gains/losses. 

As for holding later or not, it depends on a lot of factors. If you think it will drop a lot then it could still be worth cashing out before that. If taxes change dramatically under Biden (which is unlikely imo because Georgia would need to have both Dems win), it could also be a benefit to cash out now.  Otherwise, there is a benefit in cashing out in January because (a) taxes are due a year later and the time-value of money and (b) you cannot roll back losses so let's say you cash out with 100k in gains this year and then lose 100k next year. You would have to pay taxes on that 100k this year. If you had realized those 100k gains next year, then you would pay no taxes because the losses would offset them.
Hahahaha I get the reference
I just got a gram for 100.  I don't really don't it often, like once or twice a year.
I’ll find you 100 guys who have taken $50K and turned it into $5.  Is that equally as cool?

This is only because they're still in growth phase and porn is very unsavory. Once they're full on big boy can't touch that shit they can do whatever they want

Options are tricky man, 40k is a lot of money, just make sure if you’re going all in, you really see your thesis. Like you conviction has to be 1000 percent, that’s the thing this sub misses, when getting ideas from other memebers, I rode this options from MaRch saw the rise to back to March levels in September, then doubled down and bought more. If you don’t have a conviction there’s no way you could do something like that. I just knew, from all the work I put in that they were going to turn a profit at best or at worst surprise expectations.
Exactlyyyyyy!   I wanna keep putting black chips  on all the hardways and seven the fuck out I'm gonna have fun doing it!
Wow detective, you might just be my boyfriend’s girlfriend jumping to those conclusions.
I can't figure out why it is so highly rated on RT. It was okay but kinda meh also?
We’re all just trying to make it to the front of the train
Don’t worry, I have more money tucked away in accounts. This is all just play money and a learning process.
In what way? A particular 50 mile square?  How does Waylon handle Washington DC or NYC? (Spoiler: it doesn’t at all)
You guys have problems with edibles not working?

I had 75mg couple months ago and didn't do shit. Made some AVB brownies couple weeks later and got reliably ripped off them. Made the same brownies last week and they ain't do shit...

Like I've had edibles work, but 90% of the time they don't...
Love the fact that I only have to deal with snow ever if I drive about an hour or so.  That said July here takes getting used to.  It gets hot in a lot of places it doesn't stay over 105 for two months straight in most places.  That said Iowa had pretty extreme climate.  Super cold in winter and sometimes during heat wave would be pretty brutal.  Probably wouldn't think so now though on the hot but seen like 103 or 104 with ton of humidity IIRC.  Also saw -30 (-100 wind chill) in early 1980s.
Isnt there a high % of businesses who openly stated if they closed again they would throw in the towel permanently?
I played it for a year, and other forums that mention this ticker say the 20% drop every earnings is expected because of its low volume outside earning days.
Damnit! Fine I’m in. I’m good at losing money.

Here I am having suicidal thoughts again after losing my 5k in life savings that I worked years for, and I see this kind of shit again. Life’s not fucking fair man. Who knew all it took was $400. I certainly didn’t, you certainly did. 


Congrats and luck you. Be smart and protect those wonderful gains for your boy.
Lol i fucking love this sub. I got bored playing stardew so I just got a crunchwrap and a quesarito, pre packed a bowl and qued up shark tank on hulu.

Welp they got until the 11th for stimulus

Don't worry small businesses that were forced shut, you guys can always just start again right?

actually, you're the retard for not understanding institutional money is all on stocks that aren't going to be delisted, therefore you're betting that only other retards buy-in, which is retarded.

Coinb$se is fucking SUS with their conversions you lose at least 3% on “free” conversions and yuge fees for purchases. Mining fees are fucking bullshit, too much mystery in the digital market.

Not with that attitude. Like I just said before you sperged out, there's always trades like this to be made.
But I don’t wanna fuck though, just want friends lol.
Literally none of them. If played it I would use the GUSH etf and yolo.
Yea gimme a Q, a few carts, and some oil pls boss
You’ll know if your doing good coke. I’ve had to lay down on a couch before off a big rail. But I’ve also had access to supplies that it sounds like you have... hate to break it to you but your stuff sucks. Bad thing about that stuff is even if you did a bunch it still wouldn’t even really get you there cuz it’s cut down so bad with inert powder. So your burnt.
I got an accounting degree

Should I just work startups or was that luck for you?
I bought Shell and pipeline stonks on my last payday.  Oil going to the moon baaaaaby!!  We've got about 5-10 good years of oil gains ahead, homie.

Most observers expect a longer duration event. It squeezed for a year off a smaller short interest in 2013

Should I sell some of my shares from PLTR and put into GME? Whats looking better?

Good news for RKT bagholders

Bad news is that they mostly bought in at 18$-24$

If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.

I'm either not doing enough coke or every bag I've ever got is shit stuff cause it's never really fucked me up that bad. It's like a 10 minutes adderall buzz.
Yup oil price is somehow being driven up, making absolutely no sense as per usual in this market. I’m not touching any of those companies only the top few will survive next year.

great movie
I also wonder why ppl think the consoles mean good things for GME. Did they happen to have more stock than any of the other stores like Walmart or target? Or is it just ppl think they’ll sell more games than the others?
Personally I’ve never bought a game from a GameStop. I always go to Best Buy or target to get my games

FUCK THE MODS.
Don’t forget GME
Mine is less!

I left $0.48 in there a decade ago.  It's still there.
If it’s real then why tf does he only post blurry pictures with possible photoshopped numbers and an account history missing a % sign?
because people hate waiting.  they want immediate 100% gains in a day.  but yes, the smarter plays are longer dated options and LEAPs.
Be troofull now. What would i find if I lifted your skirt and looked under it

Lol thanks. I feel a little bad, all i did was tell the moderator I love eating ass. 

Feels good tho. And guess what, I really do love eating ass
I am curious when the squeeze happens...what is your estimate of how high can it go???

Let say on tuesday GME suprises and posts positive earnings that sets off the squeeze.  How high it goes?  All in a day or spread across several days?
...and most importantly..fvck u

Potential Dollar short squeeze. Or a few whales pulling the plug...It won’t take much
whenever GME short squeezes 🤡🤡🤡
I did that with DOCU earnings this week 🙃 Dropped part of the killing I made  this week (from NKLA OTM puts) on DOCU puts at close thinking the earnings beat was priced in .... and I bought 0DTE instead of a weekly like I intended too. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I wanna be the very best

I personally went about once every other month.  It actually became worth it for me to have the CNK movie pass.

A lot of people are probably like me and sitting on quite a few credits from their movie club and will be looking to use them once blockbuster movies start showing up again in theaters.

And if you know anything about movie chains, they make most of their money from snack sales, not ticket sales.

And if CNK locks in a better rate for ticket sales post-covid they could actually be in a good position
Ok.  GME.    gamestop won't stop. Got it!
I like how You have casually rounded off that extra 4922% gain.. jeez I would kill for your rounding error gains

Yup, I live in Sioux Falls, it’s better and bigger than Rapid, plus you’re closer to bigger cities like Minneapolis and Omaha. It is definitely beautiful out in the black hills tho so depends on what you’re looking for. Sioux Falls has consistently been on best places to live lists. Freedom, low crime, low unemployment, still very reasonable housing even with consistent growth and some of the best hospitals. Good luck!
lol theres the first
that flair is incredible.

Just opened an In n Out in metro Denver and it was a 14 hour wait on day 1 in drive thru and there was a fist fight. It's good but it's not _that_ good.
Idk, maybe it's because you can buy games for $50 on Amazon instead of gamestop and sometimes even get it earlier. Even used games you can get cheaper almost anywhere else. I feel like gamestop is blockbuster but the only reason they're open is because we're in the age where stocks make no sense
They didn’t announce decrease for months

And the fucking timing of everything lmao! 

Night before IPO (Thursday): Trump gets covid 

Next Monday: Trevor Milton resigns/ investigations , Nikola fraud - all EV spacs start tanking 

Then first recovery after days of slaughter: Goldman Sachs PT of $22, then followed by Jim Cramer talking shit about it that same day, then the Bonitas short report later that night. 

And to top it off, Thomas Healy and PR never defended the company. Every red day I always thought, ok it’ll bounce back the next day. It was such a shit show but my account has recovered from that and I’m happy now I’m into options and get out of positions with profit when I see it.

Will do. I don't go all in without doing enough research to reach a point of strong conviction like with GME. The plan is to mostly sell puts on a variety of stocks I like and grow some more capital for the next play once I find it.

This is pretty common with SPAC’s the same happened with any SPAC that popped after merger. It rising faster than expected and no real sellers have established yet. It’s why it takes IPO’s a week or so to start options. BYND even outpaced it’s options chain IPO.
Lol yeah i might be fukd
Duuuhhh.. I t'ought ya neww how ta read, george

Wednesday morning? OK.
Nio leaps
Over/under for stimulus being passed next week?
surely if Facebook is decreasing their salary because of relocation they would be aware in advance
Why not just purchase the real thing? It isn't too much work and is kind of sick having your own digital wallet.
Good write up. Go Raspberry!!!
Airbnb has RKT vibes. I'll stay away.
You’re nailing it 😂
here's a thot. this whole rally since March has just been a dEaD cAt BoUnCe. now it's time to drill.
False.  If forced to choose, you choose death.  They both suck, but bay area is like a little less shitty.
I feel attacked...
Social media is the absolute and undeniable linchpin of the problem. They've not just exacerbated the social issues they created, they have made themselves astronomically rich by maximizing the profits they can gain by doing so and are researching fanatically to keep the trend going without a hint of remorse for the cultural impact of their actions.

Parenting is not worse, it's been a complete shitshow of irresponsibility, physical and mental abuse and passing the blame since the 50's and that's no secret. People who didn't grow up without the internet are passing child bearing age, you might need to catch up with the times yourself on that one.

The example you gave is not an example of instant gratification, it's an example of poor financial judgement.

Entitlement is the wounded cry the boomers make when they want to deflect responsibility from themselves for the fact that millennials have a literal fraction of the wealth that boomers had at their age, and Z's only have a fraction of what the millennials had. They look at the iphones and the smart cars and moan about how nice it would have been to have that when they were 25, but don't say anything about how a smartphone has been made an integral part of having any job and is a necessity, not a luxury, nor how they paid for their first new vehicle in cash whereas the millennials and zoomers can only achieve it by taking out a 7 year loan at murderous interest rates.

You're going to have to do better than that to pass the blame.
What in the fuck?
Digital streams are going to be expensive.  They'll be good for a group showing at home, but lots of people still like going out to eat and then head out to a movie to get out of the house.

We'll probably see an improvement in food quality and price as movie chains negotiate a large portion of proceeds from ticket sales due to having to compete with these direct streams.

Discount chains that are horribly dirty and have horribly uncomfortable seats will die out fairly quick.
Small fry here with a block of shares. Should I sell a OTM FD weekly this week to pocket premium and buy more shares? I assume the IV will be high on Monday.
why?
In terms of deliveries target, Xpev is on track to crush it in Q4. Nio needs to push harder in Dec. Don’t sleep on Xpev.
What’s more likely by Jan 1 , SPY 400 or SPY 330
We’re making jokes asshole
Men bitching about women being bitchy and not considering the irony = my wheelhouse. At least women have a semblance of excuse to be bitchy. This guy aint got a cramping ballsack and clots oozing from his peen and a gf frowning about his genitals.
I recently sold my position. The upside potential is massive but they also said that about the Concorde.

"200,000% Return. 4 Pre-split TSLA options purchased summer 2019. Still holding...

Yea I didn’t realize it said the world. Read it as US.
Everyone telling me to donate to charity and not WSB degenerates who will waste it on weed and blow.

Weed and blow is a better use of money than charity. We ought to simply euthanize all poor people. Better for us and them tbhfam.

Here's where butthurt leftist redditors downvote me lololol
Sure you can, 3 2 A
Wait how did you lose money on SPX?
It also has the benefit of giving you more of a window to offset with losses. If you only gained in 2020 and you sell in December, but then you lose money in 2021, you cannot use those losses in 2021 to offset the gain from 2020 (so you pay taxes in 2020 on the full gains and then no benefit in 2021 - assuming no other gains). If you wait until 2021 to realize the gains, then you can offset any losses that occur for the rest of the year.
So no 700% gains every month? :(
Well those contracts already existed, so they could be bought and sold. Sellers probably didn't want to start more of them
Oh whoops. Thought it said US.

Edit: and that still doesn’t work lol.

How do we feel about GBTC here? I have half my net worth in it
currently doing DEEP dd and looking very hard for a good stonk to go all in leaps on so I can be like the $500 to 1m guy 🤓

It's an options trading subreddit lol
I fucked up bought fcel holding on that one for a minute im working class not much extra money but up few percent on my few plays this year.
100% annual return on 10k for five years is over a million dollars. I'm not saying you shouldn't gamble a little but it's something to think about. Instead of one big gamble this week where you lose it all, make 50 smaller gambles this year and every year after that and get rich.
Anyone here live in South Dakota? I want to move there soooo badly, Rapid City area looks beautiful

And when would that be? And you don’t really believe it’ll hit 800......

TSLA and spy
It hasnt even started.
All OTM options
Where do you sign up for that real life thing
Where are you calculating the greeks?
True, if anything IV crush on Monday is ganna be crazy. Good shit
This is literally a lottery ticket win.
watcha think is gonna run this week?
Holddd
Besides TSLA, how many other tickers did you have options on during that time?
Plot twist, OP is unable to liquidate because there is no volume for a $46535 option
He’s only posted two pictures for this trade and he has some post history. Everything else is noise. 
This is no different than someone posting something on Facebook and people believing it. 

This would be the most profitable trade ever posted on the internet. People should be skeptical.
Weren't all tickers 3 letters for the longest time and they moved to 4 when they had to? Nike been around for a minute
big if true and you did draw on a graph, seems legit
cost of living decrease
Lol you just told me to buy puts 😂😂 bro bitch niggas by puts. I am a real nigga till I die. I buy calls and when I buy calls they in numbers yafeelme? Real g shit.
Weed and blow is a better use of money than charity. We ought to just euthanize poor people.
Ok so TSLA c2000 1/1/2022 right?

Seriously it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to make a bet
You seemed like you wanted to answer more questions
How about maybe tell me all your positions so I can copy all of them please thank you
this is how i usually feel about hookers. when i jerk it instead i think about saving the $300 i would've spent

What are the odds they will turn you down and refuse? I’m new to this stuff and someone told me if they want they can just refuse to pay? Sounds lame and I hope that isn’t true. And good job btw, this is amazing!!
Damn. Didn’t even ask please or say thank you.
As long as GME is entering the 3 rd wave. So that my tendies can print. Technical can be sloppy sometimes.
does smell like pennies after
I wish there was a career as fun as working in a restaurant.
What u mean salery go down ? Why taxes ?
It's based on previous year tax return isn't it? And trades are treated differently due to the risk of loss (would be stupid to have to pay like $250k on a $1MM realized investment, and then lose your investment on some bad trades the next quarter)? All of my investing is mainly done in tax protected accounts so I don't really worry about it :D
Ok I’ll do a discount 499

Let us know next time, so we inverse you.
The RV company? Pisses me off I didn't buy when it was at 80 a few weeks ago or at least get some calls
And i mean like August when it started an uptrend.  Ignoring April to August as if it was in a constant trend that while time seems ridiculous.
Probably just forgot his password.

if you have a large options portfolio having no puts at all is pants on head fucking retarded

Anyone doing OTM oil & gas calls for Dec 18?
Take some time. Enjoy it. The next play will come to you on its own and in good time. I waited a few months with a huge cash pile for this opportunity to present itself.
So that you can be part of the famous super squeeze coming soon man. Just set your sell orders to like 800$
🥱
Administrative law
imagine if $50,000 meant nothing to him back then instead of $500
I think Jessie Livermore would call it , “ intelligent speculation” haha yeah I did the autistic thing and yolod it. In hindsight it wasn’t actually that risky. You have to consider that this was once in a life time opportunity to make a bet on the mis pricing of SOME companies. The reason I wasn’t focused on meme or EV plays was because after the pandemic is over, I’ll have all the time in the world to analyze Tesla. If I was going to do some speculation, I was going to search for a safe bet, not a “frontier breaking new valuation trade”(all of cramers picks, EVs, meme stocks). People often forget it’s actually a lot riskier when a stock rises to new highs because it then has to continue to look appetizing to new buyers. When there’s no meat left in the bone, what are new buyers going to eat?
Or Apple just needs to announce a stock buyback.
people working at Facebook making $300K a year that moves to Iowa to buy a McMansion and then saw their salary go down by 30% lol
It was moderately hyped back when it was $4 and then fell off the map because it was a long hold with no additional news going on.  No one was really expecting to see much movement past $4 till spring.
🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
yes buy the call i sell on my 100 shares please
So happy for you man!
no, I buy NIO and SPAC in my Roth but i'm not that retarded
Well in a court of law I would show all your dumb comments from today and they would be inclined to believe me. Have a nice night.
of course I don't. Why do you think im on this sub?

in all honesty, I'm retarded and didn't see the quarter part. Sure, that makes more sense. 10% more by end of quarter 1 2021 totally plausible.
May I ask how something like this is possible? What kind of app is this and what kind of investment do you do?
I am a complete newbie when it comes to investing and I would like to begin otherwise my money is stationary. Also, congratulations on the gains.

Why would you choose April as the start line for wave 1?  Shouldn't it start further to the right when price action first went positive? That greatly increases the slope and pushes the price target much higher.
Might get some leaps and shares with my 9cs for spring if the price is right
What if I want to be?
Only down $2/share. If they wont beat, why would I hold while I still have a majority of my investment?
Probably knew this headline was coming.

Nah you’re a fool, the ev explosion and Tesla’s success means regulations and incentives are LESS likely not more likely. The biggest automakers have already publicly committed to transition to EVs. The job is done, gov doesn’t need to anything anymore. Biden will announce “measures” to grab headlines but ultimately do nothing significant, basically what Obama did. 

And if you knew anything about the market you would understand that we are near the top for EV stocks. 

Also this isn’t DD just your opinion and hype.

WHO has a trading bot and wants to test this??? hahhaah. NIO sneak peek for upcoming post friends.

# 12/7-12/9 NIO Possibilities or Don't Forget About NIO WSB

**Timeframes:**  5m for entrance and exits 15min for trend analysis.

**15m timeframe:** Heikin Ashi candles

**Positions:** 30p 12/18, 40p 12/11

**Hedge:** 40c 12/11

**Theory (1):** At open, if NIO holds resistance at 44.02 - 45.19 and breaks support at 41.70, expect a drop to the 40-38+ range. If NIO bounces off support, expect a retrace to downtrend support at the 40-41+ range.

**Action (1):** Close/trim 30p on drop to 40-38 range. Keep 40p.

**Theory (1a):** If NIO blows past 40-38 support/pivot range, expect a drop to 34.38-33.56+ range.

**Action (1a):** Close all positions at the bottom.

**Theory (1b):** If NIO bounces off downtrend resistance at 40.05-41.68, expect a fall to the 40.55-38.07+ range.

**Action (1b):** Close 40c

**Theory (1c):** If NIO blasts through the downtrend resistance, expect a rise to the 41.68-45.19+ range.

**Action(1c):** Close 40p  Theory 2: At open, if NIO breaks resistance at 44.02-45.19 and finds new support at 44.02, expect a rise to 45.53 - 49.82+

**Action 2:** Sell 30p and 40p  If NIO trades sideways and closes under 44.69, then keep all positions.

What subject?
I once saw a single Palmetto bug drag an entire slice of bread across pavement. And if you get near them they won’t run from you. Think about that.
Do calls past end of the year.  This surge was driven by some support from Kentucky legislatures.  AQB should have an announcement about distribution at the end of the year which should see it jump a bit more if they announce they're successfully expanding distribution in addition to expanding farms.

Most likely no one wants to sell one with a stock that suddenly jumped almost 100% in a week. Someone needs to sell the contracts.

You don’t, this is most likely fake, but if it isn’t, you will  never have a 200,000% gain. No matter how good you can “play” the market. Either have fun with your Robinhood account, or just put your money in a stock you trust and delete the app.

How much is insurance for one of those flights? Imagine having a business tailored specifically for billionaires and having the off risk of hitting a bird. Just a single billionaire’s wife or kids would be able to sue the insurance company for greater than the value of their policy value.      

Given that, I intend to buy January calls soon.

Imo dealerships, like the old ICE guard, are going to be a thing of the past. Plus, it don't matter what public opinion is on EVs if they're the only thing in the road by 2040 or so. Interesting article but it doesn't mean EVs ain't the future imo

Last Week’s Market Summary:

Helium was up, feathers were down.  Paper was stationary.  LEDs dimmed with light trading.  Knives were up sharply.  Pencils lost a few points. Mining equipment hit rock bottom.  Diapers remained unchanged.  Coca Cola fizzled. Caterpillar stock inched up.  Balloons stocks inflated.  And toilet paper touched bottom.
Only bought one contract on them back at $4 because i was so unsure, should have yolo that.  They got an announcement about distribution at end of the year, should be good for another small jump.
Yea it is. But Tanker gang was huge here earlier this year and I’m pretty sure 100% of us lost on lol

I like to follow the Shyglizzy pattern when I try to do TA on GME. Everytime he says it's trash it goes up. Everytime he stays silent for long periods it dips.
also this strategy is a diagonal spread called a "poor man's covered call" if you want to look it up
SPXS, VXX
Can you prove that you think I dont think Trump won?
Now I'm ready for the next big dip
I mean it was perfectly clear at the time that the stock market would rocket to ATH in less than six months /s

You want to buy when theres iv crush. You dont want to buy when its high iv and then you GET iv crushed. Buy calls wed or thurs after earnings for low iv low premiums

Damn that's crazy dude. I'm at 40k now and would love to get to $500k by summer time next year. Are options the way to go, instead of positions if I want to achieve this. I'm already up 100% so I'm off to a good start!

Nice
Same here. Seemed like such the right move at the time.
Fake. need more proof 

In "summer of 2019" i doubt anyone was selling $680 calls.  

Even if they were, a quick look at options charts on yahoo finance / etrade shows that they were going for about $80, $90 

Finally, in summer of 2019 stock price was $300- $340 ish. There is no way in hell a seller would sell a $650 option for $0.23 that too 18-20 months out . 

Video proof will clear it up. We havent forgotten WSBGod yet
Serious question here, why is that more people don't do options like these? I don't do options since I'm not in the usa but what I don't understand is like for example X stock is at 50 bucks, why do people don't do like a call for it in one year for 90 bucks? Instead of trying to do short timed calls?
Probably because it's Saturday

Yes it would. Congrats on being able to do basic math. Now do you know what a quarter is and what “through” means?
Do people still buy puts?
So is it really just no one willing to write calls on it till it simmers down?
If the stock goes up then calls might cost more...

Can you prove that you don’t think Trump won?
Texas has property tax
Depends, in general IV is high before earnings so your options will experience some IV crush, so to be profitable you need a huge move in your direction.

Over the next 2-3 weeks you'll see a lot of SPCE posts, mark my words.
OP said they bought them during the crash.  So wouldn't all the options from the peak still be there until they expired, or were all closed out?  Meaning if stock is trading at $100, then the highest option might be $200, but if stock rapidly drops to $30, then might those $200 options still be available for a while?
No. I won’t change your mind
Yo peep LAZR options right now across brokerages.  

Everything is blank besides ITM

The $30 12/18’s were available Friday but as they are ITM now, there are no OTM calls available for LAZR.

Don’t say because it’s fucking Saturday because it was like that Friday, and all the other previous day premium values are still showing for everything else. 

Anyone have any inkling of an idea why this might be happening?

Epstein was convicted of selling minors for sex 5 years before johnes said he would arrested. Epstein has multiple convictions before his most recent arrest when he was offed.

Damn, wish I had sold 'em dat. But as theta gang, I don't go more than 2 weeks out, because you just never know.
Never done anything with stocks in my life but i just got myself 35 shares of it. I guess FOMO is real with me
This is such an awesome meme. Why is it not on the front page.
100% no if you don’t try. Shoot your shot
if we have even just a small pullback. 5% how would we get to 10% by jan? That would mean 15% in like two weeks
[removed]
Did you used to masturbate to Mr Ed as a kid too?
Well it was going to be one of the next 5 years. So 500 per year is 2500 against 1 million profit. So if you thought the odds of Tesla mooning were better than one in four hundred, its a perfectly good bet.

I'd say the odds of it mooning in the next 6 years were way better than that. Maybe 1 in 5 or less. So the expected return on this bet would be almost 100000%

That's a no brained. Which is exactly why Tesla has mooned. It became a self fulfilling prophecy as everyone piled in.
Doesn't tesla allow other companies to use their patents for free?
You want fries 🍟 with that ?
Take a loan against it instead. Some funds offer them interest free I think.
“I should have picked the other one...”
It means people were making big volume buys for calls on different tankers.
You're right it's too late. This is FOMO
Big words I will trust you, what are the chances we see a tender offer if earnings aren’t good?
Just be real and mature

Well what I was thinking about was this: 720% returns over five years is well over 100% annual percentage rate. At a 99% apr compounded daily it looks like a 10k investment makes you into a millionaire in five years. Is my math totally wrong? I just plugged this into a calculator online.

I know an actual stable apr is different than a fund which has some volatility to it but I don't actually know the best way to calculate any of that.

I like BEAM because the nucleases used to clip the dna have less off target cleavages, meaning it results in less unintended dna mutations. That said, for all I know they might suck at running a company. EDIT is working on some interesting diseases, but again I haven't gone through all their publications science to have a solid opinion on them.

What’s the catch
You’re conflating a flurry of HFT (same as the 70M+ volume on the MSFT news day & after) with there genuinely being hardly any float  left.

Been monitoring it closely for months, bid/ask spreads have been huge of late, seeing consistent spreads up to and over $.10. 

Spoke to a prop trader who has been making local highs on the price buying 10-15k share lots. 

There’s a reason Melvin Capital had to slam massive put buys to staunch the parabolic rise after MSFT & again Monday morning

There are nearly 70M shares short with only 65M shares outstanding, and a float in the 40Ms. This is a death sentence.

He sent multiple examples for proof. I tend to believe the proof that I can see rather than the retarded opinions of those who just believe it’s fake because they don’t want to accept that it’s real. Don’t think the contracts could be that cheap? Check the chart. Check the guys previous posts. Check the multiple times he posted transaction history and the others who he personally sent proof to. 

Whether it’s real or fake doesnt affect my life in the slightest but its disappointing to see SO MANY people on here hating on someone because they are salty. People need to grow the fuck up. OP doesn’t owe you proof but since he made the effort to provide it, maybe take 2 minutes to verify on your own

There is no special meaning. I just pointed out that they had no clue how much BB would rise up to earnings, so they were going in blind guessing how much it would fall after.
*IF* US approves vaccine in the next couple weeks. You think CVS can hit $100 by EOY? I’m considering gambol buncha $85c 12/31

buying could not all happen premarket on 21st
Nah im good lol, OP replied to my post saying he didnt have video equipment in a hotel. Literally textbook wsbgod

Im glad OP cleared things up with me in DMS. I dont owe you shit, I took all the facts and questioned it. You just blindly accept what you want and were right this time
Once the market opens a lot of people actually start trading and watching their positions/working for the day.

Then after there is real life stuff.

Those blissful morning hours of peace are where the degenerate side comes out though.

sorry if she seems tired and unusually lubed up bruh
Well... Actually I've found that if you find some stocks that have a <1m trading average that suddenly experience a spike about 1m, you can ride a volume wave up to multiple millions and the leaps are generally really cheap and sharply increase in value. It's not a guarantee each time but I've made a couple excellent trades using that method
[deleted]
So if i buy 500 @0.55, strike price @ $8.50, expiring next friday. And on friday the spot price is $9.50, i make 0.45  per share?  How would this trade cost?
[deleted]
So what you’re saying is that for the risk to rise to a sufficient level Tesla would have to become an undeniable bubble?
Bravo
Alexa, play Circles. You know the one...
Buy nio leaps
You should always max your roth ira man, its tax sheltered. You can do options in them too if you feel lile gambling with retirement money.
yeah fr I have a WS but im just holding VFV in it, not even worth buying securities since they charge a 3% FX fee meaning the second you make the trade youre down 3% so dumb
How do you figure? It says average cost .23? Where are you seeing $115?
pennies? its, $2-3 each for late month puts

BB
Half the float was traded on Monday last week
Social media in itself isn’t bad. It’s being borderline retarded and using it that causes issues without proper guidance (aka parenting)

Parenting is most definitely worse. Parents who didn’t grow up with internet have not adapted; this is just how it works. 

Instant gratification has most definitely not been around in the scope it is now. People will pay $10 on top of a $10 meal to get it delivered instead of picking it up (or getting delivery direct via phone) then complain that inflation is up. 

Entitlement is probably what will destroy this generation and newer, and entitlement is a trait that has been trending up for decades.
Could you run some DD on BB? Seems like a lot of upside.
You stfu. Why y’all want so much proof. Jelly jelly lol
That guy who turned 500 into a mill just motivated me turn my last 200 into 20k by eow
I bought the book and I’m reading it now. Had to come back and thank you.

Get half in Monday on a morning dip, half Wednesday
Thats great news actually.  I have long term exposure through Alphabet

P.s. worked at Zappos and knew Tony
Are you saying thats too much? I'm shooting for 25M for retirement
Let me ask you this: would you ever OWE money? For example, he bought for $500. Could he ever have OWED money if it went tits up? Or would it just have went to $0 and ended there?
Robinhood says it will take 4- 5 days for money to go through but mine went through right away and I was able to invest immediately.
Haha story of my life, let me know when you decide to bail so I know it’s time to buy calls
Next leg up starting. Did you see them expire the $600 weekly options with the price at $599 LOL

Damn, idk when will wealthsimple jump onto options trading. We need zero commisions to lose our money the honorable way.

Oh you are in the field. So you say. I am a moron. Isn’t it true that Charpentier and Doudna created CRSP and EDIT plus a third company im forgetting? Why is CRSP so much higher? From the little I know it seems the other companies have the right to the patents and same ownership. What am I missing. What are your favorite companies in the field. BEAM you say? I’m in! 🚀 I just put in a big order last night on edit glad you posted. Please clarify if you can
Flair checks out
So sad that all these jealous virgins spent their entire day zooming into to screenshots and screaming about it being fake. And they are all just poor and wrong. Luckily for me I’m just poor but at least I’m not an idiot and spent 2 minutes to just check the historical option price.

I cut the pain out just now by downloading grindr. Fuck these bitches man. Id rather chill with a homie, talk stocks together,  play COD together, moral support while i work on my car, lift together, play wrestle, then ending the night with some fire head cause guys know what guy like and want.
15.80 is strong support I doubt we will past it on a dip
Honestly, next time you’re bummed out that you could of made more or you sold too early, relish in the fact that your hypothesis was correct in the end and move on from there.

That's the way. Blitz it for a couple weeks in the summer, don't dress or eat like a tourist because all of that shit is marked up 300% just for your dumb ass and find a local to show you where the real party is at, you'll have less fun but you won't cringe when you remember it 5 years later.
I only post in the weekend thread because bullshitting is allowed and I don’t have positions. But I paid $8k in losses to this fucking sub and that’s a lot to me so I’m not leaving.
Elon Musk doesn't plan to take SpaceX public. According to the company, the short-term demands of shareholders conflict with his long-term ambitions. Although reports suggest SpaceX could spin-off its Starlink satellite business, Musk says he has given no thought to the possibility.

Musk says that he sees Starlink as an easy way to get hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars injected into SpaceX without having to go through the hassle and BS of an IPO.
 A retards hero.
Unbelievable. Congrats to you

Would it be smart to just buy at open Monday or wait for a slight drop?
Not hard, just gotta find the ones who 'admit' to being given information ahead of time!

...

😃
TACO is cheap af and vaccines should do it good. Just sell beforen earnings and switch to short puts, then back to calls when it bottoms out.

It always has a 20% drop due to insane volume on earnings day.

I don't think I saw an IPO, except for U, this year that didn't initially dip. PLTR, SNOW, ASAN, SUMO, FROG, RKT, etc. all dipped before mooning

Looks like he is on RH.  I mean, they are already structured - so he just needed someone on the other end to sell it to him.  I looked at selling Tesla covered calls with a 900 strike price expiring in Jan 2023.  The fee I would have collected was $10,000 per contract.  Felt strange at the time to think that wasn’t enough, lol.
Nice!   How did you get in here ☺️

I'd love to sell covered calls on GME, but then I'd be forced to hold these useless shares.
Definitely isn’t smart to inverse Cramer when everyone and their mom is interested in stock trading.
I will tell you what.
They are not a huge massive tech company, they just found what they are good at.
Again I’m not sure how old are you but back in their days they were the best in the field in my opinion.
If it’s such shit get some puts 🤷‍♂️
You win all the tendies and stonks
Idk who that boner is

I would consider less than 3 months to be soon
Lol Sure. I wouldn’t buy myself but you already did. I’d sell ASAP if you show any profit. 

If I’m reading the prices and conversion right with simple math at a glance right now, I think if nothing changes for the T.to price or the forex doesn’t move back in the other direction, and just look at the forex change since market closed on TU, I’m pretty sure you’re already at the up 9cents range you wanted in your post. 

Lots can change for forex between now and market open for TU though. Pre market if US stocks are up will likely drive USD down and CAD up for example which is good for you, but what you would want to watch out for is the opposite. If US stocks are down pre market then likely USD would go up and CAD down which will push TU down. 

Best advice I can give you is to read up on arbitrage and not do short term trades in foreign companies again until you know how to factor in forex impacts.
Why do you think that?
They should definitely censor MCOCK because its a god damned weapon

CVS might legitimately hit 100. They’re going to have unlimited government money this next year between the vaccines and the test
that would mean an increase of almost 25% since beginning of november without any pullbacks. That is literally retarded.

H C A C 🛶 gang, I call upon you!
MMs are going to cuck the fuck out of most call holders
I can do this
There are people on the TSLA investing forums and TSLA ownership clubs on Facebook that are lost up Elon’s ass and believe tesla is a miracle stock that will never come down. (I was same way with Bit-coin when I turned $12k —> $90k. I thought it was the future and held on for so long even while it was crashing down on fire. I left w/ just $18k gains.) 

They made a lot of money and decided to double down and put entire savings into it.

Not if, but WHEN TSLA bubble pops, these people will lose years of their work and savings and their children will be financially hurt i.e. will have to pick up loans and get into debt when they didn’t need to before, lose their inheritance, etc etc.

This is creating generationalt poverty since their kids will now be throw back into debt and the rat race. 

The goal is to live modestly and pass huge estates and fortunes to your children so your family continues to live comfortably and keeps gliding up the economic ladder instead of just pissing it away on a corvette and cheap cigars like most 60 year olds do near end of life.
Passed it in 2014 with an 89/100.  Just do the practice exams 20+ times and you should be fine.  Take your time though, they try to trick you a lot.

3 bedroom houses dont start at 1.2million here though. More like 700-800k. Unless you are talking about detached.

> The GTA and GVA are the only places worth living and where there are actual jobs

Depends, Have you seen blue collar work in Alberta pays a fucking lot too. Can go work with something related to oil and get paid 200k+ a year. There are jobs everywhere in Canada but GTA/GVA is probably the only places that youll find decent paying tech jobs.

>I would rather live in the states. I’d make probably 1.5x what I’m earning here, buy a bigger house for cheaper and Have the option of moving to many different metropolitan areas if I so choose. As opposed to Toronto and Vancouver

This is only the case for some professional degrees like tech,medicine. Quality of life in Canada is much much better though. United States is best for someone making 500k+ a year with a couple million in assets. Canada is way better here for anything below IMO.

So many SPY calls are not going to print this week
This is why I never buy the same call with same strike and expiration.
diamond hands or paper hands?
It'll be 400 next month
Yeah, it's obvious. My wife just had one package lost. And another arrived opened. I was like, "Yeah it's just the right size for a console. No wonder they opened it to check."

Don’t recommend shorting here unless you can live with another 3-4% upside that’s still possible.
for example I don't think ER is out by Jan 15 and therefore there isn't a chance of AAPL hitting $135 by that time. You can then sell 594 Jan 15 135c's against your Feb 130c's, each worth 160$ for a total of $95040

which if you're retarded enough you can use that to buy more calls... but seriously no.
?? You're an idiot. Shut up retard.
We dealing in 13k maple syrup left.
Hi I'm here from the front page can you dm me how to do this? Thanks
it depends on the stock. some stocks just always have a lot more volatility than others. IV alone doesn't tell the whole story.  look up IV percentiles (IVP).  there's also another measuring known as IV rank, but IVR has more serious flaws than IVP.  

as always, use your brain.  a stock that doesn't have a long history may say have IVP at only at 3% even though it has IV of 150%, but that's because it hasn't been around for a long time.  So even though IVP is low, IV is still probably way too high.  The short existence of the stock is biasing IVP. But overall, IVP is probably the best tool imo.

China doesn’t develop shit. They steal our intellectual property and produce it for cheaper, often using slave labor to do so. They don’t care at all about going green. They only care about dominating the global market. Sloppy and selectively implemented government mandates will only screw up the market. Get the govt. out of the way and let the innovation of the free market take over. If the feds can keep China from stealing our property and keep Wall Street from handing china our money then EV will take off in the US like crazy. They are the future and Americans are already realizing on their own that they’re badass vehicles, thanks to Tesla.

I can’t wait for EVs to go crazy in this country, and that we can agree on for sure, I feel.

I used to post a lot of ways to trade and my rules but I took them down. I got to inundated with questions. Now I just help people on the side. I’m not a big fan of the wheel strategy at all, however I do like the simplicity of selling puts on good companies only. But then using that premium that you receive to your advantage. In no way is option trading profitable all the time. As a matter fact you will endure many losses, and you need to learn from those. The whole trick to option trading is to have your gains outweigh your losses, always consider overall portfolio growth, capital preservation and and using your buying power correctly. That is the key.

I have hundreds of rules but you must enter options trading with the understanding you will have many losing trades.
I’m pretty sure she is forced to in order to maintain her set weight/percentage of funds in each company.

Fuck living in cold weather. I lived in Chicago for most of my life. It's fucking miserable. Never fucking again.
If you look at the calls available, none are available to purchase.  Convinced something big is about to happen
Same thing happened to me this week. Coworker saw me checking my rh so he showed me his. He has 100% of his portfolio in PLUG since May and is up 120%. I showed him my all time and he said "you're going the wrong way" 😭
I like your idea, just remember one of the reasons why retail stocks made a comeback is that they were all still generating some revenue through their e-commerce channels and some even turned a surprise profit (dillards, Nordstrom). It’s by catching wall street by surprise that you make the big bucks. Still theaters could make a comeback, just be sure to walk to that idea, not sprint to it. (Take your time)
With options, being too early to the party is as bad as being too late. Expiration dates are hard to time.
Now that’s a V-shaped recovery!
Oh it’s the rkt alright
\>\_>? how retarded are you
That's not such a bad idea. But I'm not sure if I should buy JAN 2022 or 2023 calls. The 21 JAN 22 $30 calls have a lot of open interest...
I have 9 for 12/24 and 20 for 1/15/21 leggo

Sell the calls 10-15% out of the money,  weeklies, there's good money in this.  The shares will get called away sometimes,  just buy em back. My current play with NIO, working well.

Same. My strategy is non existent. I am buying scratcher tickets basically.
So looking into BB and contemplating leaps... I wonder if it sells off regardless of the report (12/17). That is currently my biggest concern. Anyone have insight?
You can make a ton on GME without options, it's only $17 and should be $50+. That's without the insane short position and prospect for a squeeze over the course of 2021. Look at what happened last cycle in 2013, and those didn't include backwards compatibility (GME's core profit puppy is still preowned software sales)

Do half shares now, and half after earnings. I believe the big shorts will try to dump the price on Tuesday AH and Wednesday. Depending on how many paper hands we have it could drop big, the market is pricing in a ~20-25% move. 
Buy the other half when it looks like they've exhausted their load, and other big longs will be adding, too.

Yea, I've learned a good lesson this year. Weekly or even monthly calls are no good for me. The only calls I made money on where like 3-6 months out. And I got the rest of my remaining tendies in shares - feels so much safer.

I fucking love the dichotomy of this sub. There’s people in here dumb enough to lose every penny to their name betting on the idea that companies they’ve done 45 seconds of research on will gap up 20% in 5 days, effectively leaving them in financial ruin for years to come. There’s also people that do months of super thorough super nerdy borderline psychotic DD on companies they wanna bet on, winning some and losing some all while slowly building their portfolios through shares/leaps/IF’s, until they finally win those few big bets and end up multimillionaires. A beautiful contrast. Never seen anything like it

The GTA and GVA are the only places worth living and where there are actual jobs

I would rather live in the states. I’d make probably 1.5x what I’m earning here, buy a bigger house for cheaper and Have the option of moving to many different metropolitan areas if I so choose. As opposed to Toronto and Vancouver
Yes on 20 contracts not fucking 1.
Like this guy says.... Buy calls with at least 2 months of Theta. I've lost 1,000's on FDs, but made much more when I give myself at least 1.5 to 2 mo of Theta, sometimes more.
i’m crying laughing omfg
they're so sexy and dope. never driven one though. never driven a lexus or toyota but i hear great things, but my vw golf is my favorite car i've ever owned i love this thing. not fast or anything but just so well built and practical compared to my infiniti i used to have
You were calling this guy a retard 5 hours ago and now you're nuking your post lmao peak autism
I just banked $660 this week selling TSLA calls. And when I say banked, I mean the calls just expired. I'm out.  It's dangerous, sure, you've got to way for run-ups and then wait to fizzle out, but it can be done.

We'll, yeah. You said "Those calls never costed 23 cents." So you didn't say they cost 23 cents, you said they didn't cost 23 cents. But I don't get it. No one thought they cost 23 cents. They cost 23 dollars.

So why bother saying "Those calls never costed 23 cents."

I looked at tqqq earlier today and the five year chart shows over 700% returns... That seems to good to be true. What's the deal? I know it's a leveraged fund but is it actually risky at all long term?
This is going back to $2. You guys are crazy
What you’re doing wrong is thinking the odds are on your side, but not respecting the reality that 90% of the people here give their tendies to either the winners here or the hedge funds. Only the winners and cool losers talk in here and there’s like 58,000 people online on the weekdays. You’re way more likely to lose if you don’t have “it.” I don’t know what “it” is, but I don’t have it either. Try something else like working until you die.

You’re moving too slow.

All your hard work means jack shit if you don’t time it right.

The way to avoid this is to get long dated calls or play with shares.
Uh yeah obviously. But can you find a $2400 strike (300% OTM)? I can’t. The highest strike I can find is $1200
Thanks. When I look in the options table it seems to stop at a share price that's double the current stock price. Looks like this guy bought an option for triple the current share price in summer '19.  Did he just write his own call for a share price that was way out there and see if anyone would sell it to him?

This sale was part of a 10b-5, scheduled sale, which are set up in advance. Karp acquired, then immediately disposed of, 1.2 million shares. He’s still got 6 million.

Omg mate you are so wrong and you actually made a post to make fun of someone correcting you.

Let's do the maths once so you can shut the fuck up and move on.

He paid 23cts per share of premium for the right to buy tsla at 136usd on the 15th of jan 2021. As a contract is for 100 shares he paid 23 usd per contract, at 20 contracts that is 460usd.

The break even price was thus 136.23cts. But it went much above that. The price went to 599, his profit PER SHARE was 599-136=463 usd.

So the contracts are worth around 462x100=46200 usd each. He has 20 so his 460usd bet is now worth 926000 usd.

Now stop making shitposts and making fun of people who are right and go back to stocktrading boomer stock

I love your TLDR here. I'm in the very beginning stages of learning The Wheel. I'm not familiar with the Greeks yet. But I've had great success just selling puts on stocks (at about 70% chance of profit mark) I want to own anyway (Boeing, NVDA, Snow, etc). Do you have a TLDR for the wheel?

jaaaaaaa (r) t(ek) never had proof like this though. He showed me everything from the option purchase, to scrolling through each chart split on robinhood including his all time all on video.

One wierd thing is that his all time doesnt show % gain which is quite wierd. Any theories on that front?

lol who cares it’s just internet points
80 cents is the price per share of the contract which is 100 shares. So the price would be $80/contract. On a long option the risk is you can lose everything if they expire out of the money. Writing options has a lot more potential loss.
Holy crap! That's impressive. Which stocks / OTM options do you think present the same opportunity today?

OP....you are fucking amazing...jealous but happy you made such a good decision. Also, I'm just curious, I tried using optionsprofitcalculator and looked at the theoretical gains for a 1-15-23 $1200 TSLA call. If the stock were to go up another 1500% within a year and a half (which I'm assuming is a very similar scenario mathematically that OP had with his option), the theoretical gain would by about 6000%...am I missing something?

But I gurantee you when the mods request it, they will verify the post as well. 

Other users have also already verified the option pricing is legit by viewing the historical data. And I guess the decimal point is off because of robinhood maybe or the way its  compressed? No idea.

If you are making money through this sub, it is our money now. Distribute it between all of us equally (profits only, not losses smh)

I want to try just doing the opposite of what seems logical. Since hedge funds control the market and their jobs taking from the poor to give to the rich they want poor people to all think somethings logical then pull the market the other way getting their money. Ofc it’s more complex then that and honestly seems retarded and inherently wrong but I like it.

I mean, who has an EV that's equal to 5 year old Teslas?  Like in performance, or range, or anything that's unique to the EV space?  Aside from a quarter million dollar Porsche there's really nothing that's at all close.

Nobody has a charging network, at all, other than Tesla.  I know one of the big names was talking about putting chargers at their dealerships, mostly useless.

Tesla has their entire energy business as well under the same corporate envelope, while it's a bit smaller now, the growth potential is enormous.

They're also definitely getting some hype/tech lift from being arms-length from SpaceX as well I am sure.

I dunno, I get it, the fundamentals are just bonkers.  But saying Tesla isn't 5 years ahead is simply not true.

Probably more like it.
\> Don't hold til expiry, don't trade weekly's. Hold on to a contract until  it produces a profit, then sell to close. Consistent profits because  you'll be correct more often than you're not correct, if you manage your  bankroll and learn trading this way. 

Sorry I dont believe most of the stuff here, you can't make rules like that.

\>  It's almost guaranteed money  

Lol and buy my book!

&#x200B;

Stuff like this from the site is also wrong:

 • Vega increases with longer time to expiration and decreases with less time to expiration. 

Yes potentially if the whole vol surface moves, but long dated vol doesn't change as much as short dated, so realistically shorter time to expiration will give you more vega PL.
Sauce me up, I gotta see this
Ah yeah I already have several of them. Still not convinced it’ll ever reach ATH’s again though
I really thought downvote gang was just a different person each time who lost a ton of money that day. No excuse for being so salty on the weekend. Truly shameful behavior.
Theta only ramps up in the ~50 days or so before expiration. When you’re buying LEAPS years out it tends to be pretty insignificant

Lol AAL and all other airlines will be dust in 9 years. BB made a phone with a keyboard. If you weren’t in the second half of the 90s playing snake on your parents phone imagining a blackberry then you are probably retarded.

Yeah. He tweeted about it a few days ago. Surprisingly, it looks like he either deleted his Twitter or it got hacked. All the tweets on his account have been deleted and the user is listed as "Cassandra" with something in vietnamese as his bio. Whack.
There's some element of luck sure but look at the risk/ reward of those types of trades, you can make them 100 times and only need one winner. And you can get cheap yearlies, maybe not on high stocks like TSLA but a 200% OTM call on a lower price stock will generally cost you $20

You've been here too long. Shit rots your brain.
On think or swim you want to look at Jan 21 680c. This was bought before split so you have to adjust. You could buy that contract as far back as dec 18 and in June 2019 it was around the 1 dollar mark (adjusted to 136c at 0.23 post split)
Percentage-wise I do think so
Ouch!!!!!
You’re retarded.

And yes. I'm pretty good at photoshop. It's a good skill to have, thank you.
Personally looking for $1.1B-$1.15B rev (not that important, we know it's going to be shit)

Gross margin should surprise. CIQ consensus was \~29% IIRC, I view 31-31.5% as more likely.

SG&A is also a big wild card. That's what management promised. If this comes in strongly we will see a positive EBITDA print. That would be impressive. 

But the guidance/outlook/story for the future means a lot more than this.

It’s harder to change the culture of the company to realize why they became irrelevant.
Here you go sir
There was also a time when IBM made more money that MSFT and AAPL combined, and it was "the" tech stock.  But they became more concerned with financial engineering than execution and next gen tech, and after a decade of being left behind they basically had to do a reverse merger to "acquire" RedHat to become relevant again.  With INTC botching execution, there's real fear they're being left behind in real time.

You guys are chasing a dream buying new EV companies.  So many car companies have bankrupted over the years, it’s probably the most difficult and and competitive industry to break into.  Nothing has changed with car production, there’s so many costs, raw materials, labor, plant, transportation costs. At best you make 1-2% profit margins.  

On top of that you think the current majors are just gonna roll over and die?  Come on, Nissan, Ford, Toyota and GM are gonna come strong.

How do you make a call last so long?  I thought they expired every month.
Uberkikz what do you think about Q3 estimates? They should be roughly right, right? I think somebody else here had a thread where he was saying with the credit card data he saw on some websites, Q3 should be like 1 Billion revenue so a decline of 25% or so, roughly, in Q3.

I think that's also what the consensus analyst estimate is.

50% shares, 50% cash. Things might still go up for no reason, but I’m more emotionally ok missing out on a retarded pump than buying in just before a crash I should have seen coming.

PLTR calls, got it!
Except he's right ?

20 contracts, 136 strike price, paid 23cts a share at 100shares/contract is 460 usd. Now the share is worth 598 so each contract is up frop 23cts to 598-136 =462usd/share  =  46 200 usd per contract.
can someone help me out here, I'm thinking of buying a few options contracts for this stock but have never bought them before. If I understand correctly the total potential loss I could incur is just the cost of the premium (is this correct and if so whats the risk even it only costs 80cents a contract) but how much could I theoretically make

Look up ‘stock options‘ if you want a better explanation of what he made his gamble on. In general, they’re very popular in places like this as a higher risk higher reward way to try to make money on the stock market. Of course, this is an exceptional case (given the absurdly low chance of it working out for him). Most of the time you are lucky if you double or triple your money, and an extremely lucky play would make you 5-10x.

I’ve got 1500 shares and 20 contracts of March $9 calls..
I'm not fretting... I'm just new to this. Trying to get my feet wet making experiments, small risks, but I'm also not trying to just throw money down the drain. I'm trying to get the methodology down before I find myself down $300 or even $3000. Frankly, if you have no advice for me, you can take your unnecessary attitude/comment elsewhere and kindly fuck off. Thanks
Now you're speaking our language ya retard
Leaps are the worst for this strategy.

Options trading and Knack have given my life meaning
I think it is pretty self evident why. Physical height has always been an advantage, so warlords back in the day that held unto more resources were taller than their counterparts. Then, their descendants became kings and lords, and then some of the nobility became the bourgeoisie, still tall af. Also, better nutrition in these higher circles is what allows for more body growth, while poor folks missed out on some of the nutrients that are essential for a strong, tall and healthy body. It is only recently that things are starting to change because of increased social mobility and the fact that wealth today depends much more on your mental capabilities than on your physical strength.
It depends on how strong your conviction is. I bought OTM leaps. Bigger the risk the bigger the reward

Every time I hear “manipulation” I think of Alex Jones. Every time you buy a share you are manipulating the price. They had big news, and if you don’t think they will be over 300 by summer, then you are sadly mistaken.

Apple brought to the world something innovative just like BB before them.
The difference is that apple pretty much made a flawless device and even more flawless retention strategy. Look at the iPhone it looks pretty much the same since the first one should tell you something about how flawless it is.
Anyway BB does not compete with apple anymore and I don’t even think they have much competition at what they do with AWS that’s why a company like Amazon will partner with them and not make their own shit.
Besides their deal with AWS to provide vehicle manufacturers a platform to collect and analyze data from different car chips and systems they also provide cyber security to governments and multi billion dollar companies AAL is one of them if I’m not mistaken.

You don't need to be someone that cares about the environment to see that EVs are the future of transportation. He would be an idiot not to be one of those advocating for the future technology when China is clearly taking a major leap into EVs. US already has outdated train systems, it would be pretty bad if we held on to gas vehicles going into the future and become one of the worst global pollutants while other countries switched over to green transportation. Anyone that has any sight of the future knows gas vehicles will be replaced and it's looking more and more like EVs are what's going to take their place. Betting against EVs is like betting against Netflix and buying Blockbuster back then.
FUKKKKKKKKKKK
Think theyll make up for it. HBO Max needs it
What annoys me is that’s around the time I started investing (actively - I’ve had a 401k I put money into fit like 10yrs)  but I didn’t really know about options til this year. I totally would have bought calls on Tesla back then if I knew what they were 😔 #thiscouldbeme

My thoughts are that there’s so much buzz about the squeeze; everyone and their mothers are keeping an eye on this stock. If it dips, it either gets bought back immediately by those that have been waiting on a good price, or the shorts will start covering, raising the price back up anyway. Can’t be much to lose this quarter if you have long calls/shares...just gotta be patient.
Hbox is better

Run up last week was hallmark manipulation. No volume, two two sigma days in a row on some bullshit news. That’s exhausted.
Buying hella NIO leaps after what I saw today and we’re at a dip? Even better

infiniti kinda sucks tbh
Just saw the post of the guy who claims to have made 200,000% return on extremely far OTM TSLA leaps.

I'm just gonna go ahead and say he is full of shit. Don't have proof, but it's not hard to shop some numbers on a robinhood screen.
These were 300% OTM at the time. I’ve never seen an option available that far OTM at any expiry ever. Maybe I’m just not looking hard enough but I’m skeptical
What’s with all the downvotes?
There’s a bunch.. like mine (WA)

Start watching QELL
minimum 18% maximum 40% of the available outstanding shares will be taken out of circulation.  Say 30% as a rough guess of all shares disappear.

The million dollar question is will it skyrocket, or is the price increase already baked in with the 40%  rise in the past week.
Dude sell some at 60. Just 4 max U wont regret it. Thats how good Traders trade. U got a Lucky Hand now realise some Profits and keep the Rest running this way there is 0 Chance U regret anything. Cuz U can never be Sure in Trading.

I just have one question. What books/material do you study to educate yourself?
Yup.  Bought in Sept '19.  Couple of days before 3rd quarter earnings.  Bought $300 and $420 Jan 15, 2021 calls.  Paid $39.50 or $7.90 split adjusted for the $300 and $12 for the $420.  I sold the $420 back in March when everything started collapsing due to covid.  I kept the $300 because I knew it wouldn't fall below $300.
Ditto my guys lol
I’m Paul Allen
1st team all defense vs dpoy. Roco better shooter. Draymond better passer. roco better team defense. draymond better individual defense. Looks like a wash to me. Prime draymond maybe has the edge slightly

Most companies will purchase 3 days before and 3 days after, cost average the hell out of them and hope that the average acquisition cost equals EOD closing price on the 18th.

I don’t he will honestly he’s not as retarded as most wsb posters

One center ? This is retard status
Lmao have you never had any capital gains? If you sell a stock the gains you have are taxed in the 2020 Fiscal Year, payable sometime in 2021. If you wait just 2 weeks from December 18th, that tax bill is postponed for a year, cause it's now included in your 2021 Fiscal Year taxes, payable in 2022.
Buying 2 year NIO leaps after the TSLA run ends. Here’s hoping I can come back with some gain porn a couple years from now like homeboy today
People who actually want a nearly sure way to make fat stacks rather than lottos
You’re really going to bring up a bunch of sectors they are years and years behind in? Mainstream companies are known for their product. It’s all hype and a smoke show. Anybody at the top of their game isn’t working for a named institution.
I’m gonna read this after my edible
I'm talking about in actual testing, Waymo's system has vastly less driver interruptions per mile than FSD.
I'm so confused. How does 500 turn into 1000000?Anyone want to eli5 this for me?
Lol
They aim to be North America's leading miner.
is it crazy to think that this year's Portland team is comparable to the 2016 warriors?

Dame \~ Steph 

CJ \~ Klay

Hood \~ Barnes

Roco \~ Draymond

Nurk \~ Bogut

DJJ \~ Igodaula 

Portland's bench looks slightly better than that year's Warrior bench. Better wings, better bigs.

Klay > CJ but Nurk is way better than Bogut. Steph is slightly better than Dame. Roco and Draymond is a wash imo.

Lol how demeaning. That's like one weekend shift

CRISPR Therapeutics was founded by one of the co-discoverers of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, Emmanuelle Charpentier. They're one of the leaders and favourites in implementing the tech into clinical trials effectively and if they can actually create effective therapies they'll be a market leader in a massive biotech field
Ugh x2
in real estate.  Thanks for the stats on refis.  I would argue that foreclosures won't go up next year because everyone has equity in their home.  They'll just sell it instead of foreclose.  

Also, I'm staying away from this and RKT because of the stats you gave.  This is their best year and refi's are all going down from here.  Nobody will refi a loan that is 2-3%.  Refi's are not a replicable business.  People do them once and forget about them.
Just like when old meme formats hit the next generation of users

Some Chinese company owns the BB brand so no relevance there.
[removed]
Don’t think so.
Probably still TSLA.
Bullshit
Or you could use that money to continue trading, make $1m and donate $100k. Unless you think you will lose it all if you keep trying to trade it, in which case maybe you need to put that money in a savings account as a safety net for when you lose it all. Because let's face it, you are gonna keep trading if you win.
Look at the chart of that option then tell me what you see
Indeed, I could be his alt(i fucking wish).

Dip is done, it's going to open above it's closing price because of the dung-coin surge this weekend.

Buy shares
I mean there’s the summer of George!
I bought like 1000 shares when it was like 3.45 a share based solely on the fact that it used to be RIMM,  and the ticker was funny. Had no idea it would get involved with Amazon.
Just pretend it’s a dominance thing
Wow, thank you!
Queens gambit. 8 episodes
My 8x ARKK 1/15 115c and 8x ARKG 1/15 90c like the sound of this.
it means buy April calls instead of December/January calls

or just buy shares
That’s what trading is honestly
Tiny correction, QNX is used in pretty much anything that requires a high level OS (HLOS) which is safety qualified. You will find it across pretty much all OEMs, either for the infotainment systems (center console) or their ADAS systems (automated driving).

As far as safety centered HLOS with compatibility across multiple forms of silicon are concerned, QNX is close to the only option you have.

That said, QNX has been around since the 90s. It may have changed companies a couple of times but it has always been around, so why is QNX suddenly really important worth mentioning?

Now blackberry IV OTOH, now that may be something...
Is this one of those "I made a bot read 10,000 pages of 2020 script and this is what it spat back out" things?

I had a wet dream about Palantir the other day. This was in the future. They forced me and a bunch of other people into this bus/ train and drove us to this facility I was thinking cool I can go on wsb the next day and say how I was one of the people taken to the Palantir facility. Anyway they were saying something about entertainment being provided and I was taken to a room and a voice over the speaker said something about sex so I lay on the bed and some invisible AI woman fucked me and I bust a fat nut.  The fuck is wrong with me.
I’ll message you when it prints

It's related to the (eloquently named) fecaldollar?
Man I wanted to believe this is true but after reading through all the comments seems unlikely. Tesla was trading around $200 last summer, so even tho a $680 call was out fetched an 1.5 year out option wouldn't be trading for a dollar
Yes
Where was this advice before I bought 12/4 calls
I would still lean toward shares right now. The rocket is on the launchpad, I just don't know how far along we are in the countdown, and that theta fuse will deep dick you quick. 

Shares at ~$17 will still make you a shitload when the 🚀 launches, and then you can layer into calls.
Where’s the coffee button ?
My dad has held BB since about 2009 in the hopes it’ll come back. I think there’s lots of Canadian boomers doing the same thing.
This guy fucks.
If it drops hard after earnings we might see it dip to 12ish. But I think there’s strong support at that price. I’d double up on my shares if it gets there
If i see rockets my 2 brain cells tells me hes right.
That's sad
There's clowns that are suing to get their money back after donating to the legal fees lmfao

Not a conspiracy theorist (im lying) but there was never a successful version of a corona vaccine because they all failed during the animal testing phase , this time they were given the opportunity to bypass that phase and they somehow came up with it?

But can you sell it who would buy such a crazy call
Definitely! Good luck:)

I’m not saying it’s entirely fake maybe exaggerated. TSLA was around $240 in Sept. ‘19. Presuming that’s when you bought yours, what exp did you pick?

Im in monday bro lets go I only skimmed your post but sounds promising
Don’t have enough cash rn for 04/20 calls, how retarded would it be to buy earlier calls and keep rolling them? Will probably pay more in premium overall, but I could buy more contracts now.

Will have more cash in like two weeks, so should I just wait?

Because your dumbass fomos at the top and paper hand panic sells at the bottom

Yes. For these dividend stocks, if you are going to play options, call in this instance, buy at the bottom of the channel that they are trading in. With basic chart reading and simple indicators, you can spot those trends. But they never move enough for maximum short term returns.
where are you when pltr $300
Buy mostly shares. Half now, half after earnings.

Wait until the IV crush to stack calls, or do debit spreads and close the further out leg on the crush.

Really? Post pic

Oh man I feel this.  I got 15 pltr calls for Feb 2021 at 36....  IDK I feel this thing has the same energy as TSLA behind it.  Anyone else feel that way?

Those are the people who always seem to make the most money.
Thanks I know
because you're not buying INSANE OTM leap calls and holding them nearly a year
Actually of you look at it the move was on Monday or Tuesday when they released the news with AWS and retested the 7ish mark and held two days in a row.
I’m positive I will get to my strike price within the next two weeks. Wouldn’t advise to hold till it expires 🤷‍♂️
Yh I can realistically see low 20s but after ticker change I don’t know. Clueless.
You care. You just don't know it yet. ;)

Who here is still holding GME shares?

Imma sell depending on earnings.
But find me any company on the stock market that has options available for over %300 otm? Nio for example only has 80c for 2023, where are the 160c for $1 lol. Also why on earth would someone holding $18k worth of Tesla stock sell an option for $23.........

you do you and me do me, ok?
If you think a stock is going to stay above a certain amount you sell a put credit spread for that strike and collect money, if you think the stock is going to drop you can buy a put debit spread and limit your gains(and risk) instead of buying just a put. And just think of the opposite with call credit and debit spreads
First order of business:
whoever designed their new logo needs fired expeditiously
If I'm looking to get in at that very moment, I just buy at the ask, especially for something that cheap. If I go in between the spread, I would say about 30-40% success getting filled in my personal experience. Usually not worth the amount that I missed out on in the long run.

As a guy who bought a really cool looking car because he likes cars, not to get laid, NGL i was a little disappointed when i found that all i attract are kids (usually boys; and yes, i know how that sounds), men, and babies tend to just stare.

I was having lunch with a friend outside and a 599 goes by with the most amazing engine sound, i pause the conversation and tell her to check that out, pointing in the vicinity of the car driving by. She sees the car but doesn't even realize what she was supposed to be looking for.
Damn, how much money did you lose on PLTR to come here on a Saturday night downvoting everything?
What was your total investment to get to $5 million? And how in the world did you go from $500 to almost a million? Crazy
Depends on whether or not it becomes a meme. I could see mid $20s pretty easy.
What stock ?
You forgot VALE
he came out but we already knew he gay.
Still a waste of money. That's like 30 different hot ass escorts worth of money on 1 girl lmao.
I hate to give trading advice. Because when I buy a PLTR option and loose 100$ it's fine, it's my money. But I am not feeling like ruining someone else's financial situation with my trading inside. Fuck that
This is actually drives me crazy with jealousy fuuuuck

In all honest Blackberry was ahead of the curve on a lot of their products.  The swipe to open was on the playbook and the BB10 was cool and they did it years before apple abandoned the home button.  The OS was good and secure, but the big problem was nobody created software for it.  The Playbook was a very good internet browser.
;)
Lol my portfolio would be disappointed but that would be really funny ngl
i just need $124 tbh
so, never?
I still got the nudes from jenny lawrence if interested
If you guys think it’s going to dip post earnings on Tuesday, buy outs and when those print, use tendies to average down on more shares.
😂
If you choose neither you receive the common cold

So you're saying she's got daddy issues. Nice.
Who said it was his entire account
yes I agree

I'm still scared of my April 15c's getting IV crushed but majority of my position is in shares so whatever. It covers Q4 and your DD over the past few weeks have been helpful for boosting my conviction in GME

hopefully Sherman actually gives a guidance this coming Tuesday
Holy shit you guys are dumb.

He bought them LAST YEAR BEFORE THE SPLIT.

I couldn't be further from it. I know of her but honestly haven't dove too deep into her work. If we are getting into philosophy, i lean way more towards the Napoleon Hill and Charles F Haanel approach. I believe life, past  ,present and future have always been in our own control but that there is certainly other powers at hand that we can take control of to assist in achieving "great or grandeur" goals.

Hey OP, think I could borrow 20k for keepsies?
Gentlemen, I need you to leave
Ya, but what's the strategy to go one way or the other?
I have positions in VRTX because I knew that the trial for sickle cell was going well (good early reports and no notifications of trial halting for side effects). VRTX recently dumped hard because they discontinued trials on another, unrelated, drug. That seemed like an overreaction, because they have another drug for the same condition still in the pipeline and their CRISPR based therapies look like they’re actually going to work.

I was very skeptical for the same reasons as you (I work in biotech as well and have heard that CRISPR is somewhat overhyped), but seeing some articles about patients who had received their sickle cell treatment prompted me to take another look. Thanks for posting the paper, going to read this over the weekend. CRSP and VRTX are holding a joint investor presentation on the results on Wednesday, so that could be a catalyst as well. 

IMO, VRTX > CRSP for risk to reward right now, but, there’s a chance VRTX acquires CRSP, in which that would be reversed. Check out ARKG ETF to see some other companies in this and adjacent spaces. The ARK folks really know what they’re doing, so I’ve been very happy with my investment in their ETFs and using their research to guide some single name plays.
Seriously? How the fuck?

As long as you're not on Robinhood, you should be able to buy them. They trade like shares.
Fuck that! TENDYS mf.
 So since NKLA is like a fake company, does that mean the badger isn’t coming out? I really wanted to buy that
Leaps are so cheap. Pretty low risk to throw a few hundred in and forget about it. I’ll just sell one of my GME shares for $500 during the short squeeze and make that money back if BB doesn’t pop 😂
I'm still 75% in recovery stocks, just focusing more on companies with solid financials.
Wouldn't touch.

I've been training myself to take 20% profit, unless I've done enough DD to feel confident in a bigger gain. It has been working out very well for me and I've grown my portfolio by almost double in 3 months.
I saw the percentage in thought Wait that's impossible... Then I saw the negative... Tough shit bro... GL...
I own and have long term options on several, I bought 65 calls for 1/21/22 back in August and that’s taking off, Magnite is TradeDesk little sister with incredible potential, and CRWD I got in back in April, I follow a board on Motley Fool, Saul’s Discussion Board and there a lot of smarter people than I whom give out some incredible information on growth stocks

Then sell before earnings, since it will dip a few percent despite beating expectations. Buy calls on the dip and ride it up again a few percent past it's pre-earnings price.

Either you're trolling or you're too dense to search online to find basic information or lack elementary reading comprehension skills.

For 2020, the [maximum contribution to a Roth IRA is $6,000 per year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimwang/2020/02/20/supercharge-your-retirement-savings-with-a-backdoor-roth-ira/#657df0bf8f08). But if you’re 50 or older, that increases to $7,000 per year.

There is a bit of a catch with that contribution. It’s only available to those who have earned income. That includes income from salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, self-employment, freelance and contract work. For example, if you have $20,000 in earned income, you can make the full contribution allowed. But if you only earn $4,000, that will be your maximum contribution.
Who the hell spends 17k on on engagement ring
Weighing in as a Vancouverite... the company is more than well positioned as a boomer company can be but only boomers would set up phone plans with them. Shaw/Freedom is a way better deal. 

More importantly though, Telus is Canadian like you called out. That means that they trade hedged to USD. Take a look at the last 6 months for USD/CAD and compare that to Telus performance. Hint to make it really easy just look at T.TO compared to TU. What you’ll really be betting on here isn’t Telus as a company but the USD to CAD. Some folks have even used stocks like TU to do Norberts gambit since it doesn’t move much. Up to you if you want to essentially do options on Forex.

Damn awesome. But in all seriousness if you haven't done anything yet, get a qualified financial adviser to help you manage all the risk. If there's not a lot of stuff going on, you might be better putting half of your gain on something low risk(index funds or bonds or wtv), real estate(risk- it depends), just to make yourself a safety net in case anything goes wrong.

**[American Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American Jews)**

American Jews, or Jewish Americans, are Americans who are Jews, whether by religion, ethnicity, culture, or nationality. Today the Jewish community in the United States consists primarily of Ashkenazi Jews, who descend from diaspora Jewish populations of Central and Eastern Europe and comprise about 90–95% of the American Jewish population.During the colonial era, prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim, Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America's then-small Jewish population, and while their descendants are a minority today, they, along with an array of other Jewish communities, represent the remainder of American Jews, including other more recent Sephardi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, various other ethnically Jewish communities, as well as a smaller number of converts to Judaism. The American Jewish community manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions, encompassing the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance. Depending on religious definitions and varying population data, the United States has the largest or second largest Jewish community in the world, after Israel.

PSA: gamble/scalp with FDs, sell weeklies, monthlies for ER run ups, and leaps for real money making.  Spreads and butterfly’s for risk management.   Research 2-3 stocks that will have a big year next yr and see if they have some reasonable 1 yr low IV leaps.  👏🏻✊

Stocks can split. If you have 1 share worth 100, a company can decide to split the stock so now you have 2 shares worth 50.

No one knows what's going to happen. The 🌈 🐻 are on a timer that we just don't know when it runs out. But this data tells me that if they don't yield before March they'll get fucked by the 4Q results.

This is why GME is not a FD play, you need to 💎 🤚 and own shares or longer dated calls (April+, and with IV so high I advise ITMs)

Wrong again. They would be selling for 5x 0.23 as that’s what happens to contracts during a split. If you look VERY closely through your biased, doubting eyes, you will see they were trading for exactly this figure.

Instead of making dumb assumptions. Just look at the chart for 680c in June 2019 and tell me they weren’t trading for around 1.1. They even traded for as low as 0.39 at one point that summer.
Does this mean someone will get a early exercise to fulfill?

Don't jynx it and dont hype it. Let them buy stupid oberpriced airbnb bags in a pandemic instead.
You're right and I let my dumbass friend who knows nothing about the stock market talk me out of yoloing my savings into a freakin mutual fund. 

Mutual funds were all i knew then. 
He's literally the biggest asshole ever now. 

I waited Years for this opportunity, i missed out on cheap housing in 2008 (cuz i was 14) and now I missed probably the only other opportunity to get a little bit ahead. FML.

Also you buying airbnb or doordash next week?
You kids are going to ruin the market. You should only be buying and selling what Cramer tells you to buy like me.
Fuck so the squozening isnt gona happen after earnings? All my friends keep doubting me saying GME is going under and I wna prove those gay bears wrong so bad. 🚀🚀

Hi im still learning and have a few questions about option trading. Please answer them as brief or quick as you want and thanks!!!

1. Are buying contracts another way of saying buying options calls and puts?

2. I thought call/put options are way more risky bc of a high return/loss? Why am i reading or on youtube and they are telling me you only can lose a few $100 how is that high risk? Your only losing a few $100 bc thats all it takes to buy a call/put option??
remember: good enough for screenshot, good enough to sell.

Pennystocks have their own subs as well.. My entire point wasnt that anything that has it's own sub should be banned here, just that it doesn't really fit WSB (unless it's a big YOLO brag) because they don't have enough room for content. Spacs are notoriously pump 'n dumpy, doesn't have options and are generally limited in price range/potential. They are also always hyped, and thus doesn't fall under the radar, and DD is by nature limited and speculative.

Nowhere in my post did I say I think Tesla will go down? I'm simply stating facts about the valuation. I have no positions on Tesla and won't be taking any because there's no factual basis for it's price at the moment. Take the emotion out of your investments and you'll stop losing money. 👍

It’s not, they were available as low as 0.91 that I saw. Contracts released when stock price was like $340, then it fell to $180 and the price on these collapsed. A few folks on Tesla investor forum got them for the price above, I paid $2.81.

In simplest terms, the man spent 500 dollars a few years ago on the stock market equivalent of a lottery ticket for Tesla. Like I’m talking an astronomically low chance of not losing all 500 dollars he put in.

He got indescribably lucky in that Tesla stock skyrocketed beyond all plausible expectations, such that that 500 dollars he put ended up being worth nearly a million.

ETFs are funds that contain a basket of securities that are from the index that they track. For example, ETFs that track the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) will contain the 500 stocks in the S&P. Typically, if the S&P moves 1%, the ETF will also move by 1%.

A leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P might use financial products and debt that magnify each 1% gain in the S&P to a 2% or 3% gain. The extent of the gain is contingent on the amount of leverage used in the ETF. Leveraging is an investing strategy that uses borrowed funds to buy options and futures to increase the impact of price movements.

However, leverage can work in the opposite direction as well and lead to losses for investors. If the underlying index falls by 1%, the loss is magnified by the leverage. Leverage is a double-edged sword meaning it can lead to significant gains, but it can also lead to significant losses. Investors should be aware of the risks to leveraged ETFs since the risk of losses is far higher than those from traditional investments. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveraged-etf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveraged-etf.asp))
Yea same here.. When it went up to $51..and then a 10% pullback, I thought this is only going higher lol.. And then it was 10% one day, 15% next and didn't stop. The institutions did teach spac holders a good lesson though. Never again..

I would not buy leaps in any of them, BUT if I had to I would buy BABA. Compliance with audits could be a huge boon since the main source of them being undervalued is fear that they aren’t truthful in reporting since they do mostly Chinese business. Not to mention, unlike the other two they are profitable and comparably have a longer history as a stable company. 

I intend to sell puts on them Monday morning and rake in some premium, happy to own shares if they get executed. Hell, happy to own shares at current levels.

This is good for anyone curious

Yes you want to consider all of the greeks but Gamma isnt the most important for this strategy because of low IV trading 

All gamma would tell you is that the closer to being ATM the higher the gamma. 

It's not like you'll find better gamma by going farther OTM

And you shouldn't need gamma to tell you that you're going too far OTM

But even deep OTM contracts can turn huge profits. Like my April $70 INTC call which is deep OTM but because of increase in IV after purchase and increase in underlying it went up by 333%
Couldve bought her a civic smh
holy fuck you won the lottery
It’s literally impossible for this trend to continue. I just wish I was a few more leaps out. The SPY is running on empty.

Eh, it's only money. You can always get more.
You must not be pulling it hard enough. Did you try taking out a second bank loan?
Zoomers these days can't even use paint.exe, it's just screenshot with their phone and crop it out. Maybe if they aren't lazy, slap fucking emojis IN the picture

Remember a few months ago when people were mistakenly buying TLSA instead of TSLA?! 😂seems that people know the correct symbol now.

We've heard hospitals are close to capacity for c. 2 months now I think. At what point do they break? I say that not as a 'bait' question, but seriously. Assuming the vaccine does not properly relieve hospitalisations for 4-6 weeks at earliest.
A lot of the companies changed auditors to comply with the us regulation including one of my former employer.🐝 is gonna moon whether you like it or not
ITM vs OTM options? Why?

i quite enjoyed it but if you're looking for philosophy lessons it's pretty extreme imo. i enjoyed the story though and i think the philosophy is at least interesting and worth some thought, and the way people talk about Ayn Rand it's clear most haven't read her work or tried to understand her ideas, so reading at The Fountainhead definitely helped me grasp and respect the ideas because they're completely different from what many proponents and opponents of hers seem to think

edit: also if you plan on picking it up be warned that it is *long* and **long-winded**. so it can definitely be exhausting at times
Paloma! For sure
I bought $19 puts when it was around 27 with a good expiry.

why not wait for a nice dip before buying shit like that? could have parked that 10k somewhere meanwhile

I’m fully erect. Fuck all the pussies selling off. I’m holding my shares @17.1 and buying more at the dip. (If there is a dip)
Daddy whats your moves for the year? any advice on leaps etc
This could only go up from here!
Dude... fucking sell and retire.
One person swapped long to short, thats why the Weekend Dow is showing volatility since it's  7 people who use it
First off, thanks for the link. I knew that they had wash sale rules for options that "looked like" shares, assuming you had shares, sold them, and bought back ITM options to maintain the same exposure. But i didn't realize that they also considered a deep enough ITM covered call to halt the clock on your shares position if exercised.

That said, according to the article you linked, it seems that it just pauses the timer on the shares, but doesn't change the sale date, when it does sell. Granted, first time seeing this so i'm still in the dark. Thanks for sharing, though. And if you have any clarification, I'd love to hear.
Lol 😂😂😂
These are puts then?

Run into the $180s? Id guess the $200s. Its not "meme" status by any means, so you should be fine. WSB will be too concerned with GME earnings next week to really pump this. Maybe another post or two per day, but not the onslaught of 100s of posts the memes traditionally produce.

What you said makes perfect sense. Good luck to you. I hope you continue to learn and progress. 

These things were the beginnings of how I developed my trading strategies. 

Also, you should expect people to go crazy over your wording. Saying "guaranteed" anywhere will set people off. 

And unless you've done this for 25 years and are Warren buffet, expect haters. Remember, even cathie wood still has a long train of haters.
bought them thursday around $123
No doubt. I grew up going to Worlds of Fun, Cedar Fair’s main park, and I just can tell you from experience that the company doesn’t give a flying fuck about people or anything other than making ridiculous profits.

There’s been numerous deaths and decapitations at their parks and they keep on chugging.

Agreed, I made the same play later. Everyone in here talking like “no this was a lucky gamble, I know how options really work and you just guessed”.

Come on this is wsb, we’re all gamblers here and this was a great bet with amazing odds.
Puts?
Get a new one!
You're wrong. My point is you can only contribute $6000 max a year if you have a job that pays you more than that in taxable income. Capital Gains don't count because it isn't considered earned income. Just go and read about it online. You can't contribute money if you're currently unemployed.

"**You can contribute** to a **Roth IRA if you** have earned income and meet the income limits. Even **if you** don't have a conventional **job**, **you** may have income that qualifies as "earned." Spouses **with no** income **can** also **contribute to Roth**IRAs, using the other spouse's earned income."
Honestly go cash gang for like a week. You'll be happy about it

I'm still confused about options - how did you only spend $500?

Everytime I try to buy in I have to buy 100, which means I have to spend a ton of money.
Do you know where you are?  One of these retards would definitely buy that lemonade stand and then they would piss themselves and smear shit all over it
Why did you choose to buy these options?
That amount of time you’re fine
Rounders, Molly's Game isn't bad
I’d also take it a step further and say they failed partly because they were ahead of their time. The internet was not a household item during their era. E-commerce was in its infancy let alone the idea of ordering shit for your pets.
Tons of volatility in Weekend Dow.... Went from 80% of clients being Long to 68% being Long in just a couple hours.

Glad you made some money bro
Kind of a big deal, no?
Its a sign that you have a bad diet dumbass, lay off the checkers and taco bell
when are their shares freed?
my guess is coming from the earnings report. im hoping it’ll come back lower because of covid. then people will sell, and i’ll have a seat on the cone of a rocket to tendie town 

or i lose more money i probably shouldn’t spend. but either way, something will happen
Not fake. He's in r/teslainvestorclub every day posting.
Well, technically he can still lose everything since he's still holding it. Now would be a great time to sell. Same could've been said when he was up 10-20%, 200%, and so on.


He could've lost it all if the stock hadn't rebounded like it did. But...it's Tesla. This is just what it does, so he just held on to the options and waited. That was probably a pretty terrifying few days for him, though.


I'm sure the FAQ section can help.
Risky, let’s see if it pays off
Yes and they weren’t selling for a measly .23, 2.3 is possible but .23 no way.

Bought a bunch of XOM at $35 and some 40c and 45c in the summer/fall. I expect them to print.

Tesla's stock is up that much. Tesla's actual growth is not. Their EPS is abysmal.
It's big data analytics software. Basically, to scour large databases currently requires some basic coding knowledge and further manipulation and analysis to gain useful information. Their software streamlines that process and the eliminates the need for that skillset from information gathering. 

It basically just fucked 50% of the jobs in the data analytics profession.

What about TRNE?
The pic is a lie. It’d be more believable at $23 a share. $2300 a contract. Turns out the historical data puts it at around $14 a share which my approximation wasn’t too far from.

Sometimes it do be like that.
Same brother, loving the position honestly and will probably buy more
When a biotech company’s “most promising” compound is numbered as “SYN-010”, it generally means they don’t know what they are doing...

For reference, Pfizer vaccine is BNT-162b1 and b2, JnJ is JNJ-78436735, Moderna is mRNA-1273.

Nobody is so good that their first or 10th compound hits the jackpot. Also, the rounded number just reeks of fraud
Yeah so it’s worth noting real quick too that 

1) his math is a little funkier because in the time he’s owned this contract, TSLA stock did a split 

2) he can just sell this contract to someone else for around $900K instead of actually having to buy the shares and reselling them 

3) he doesn’t have to resell the shares if he would prefer to just spend $250k to buy them and continue to watch them grow - right now they are worth $1.2M but maybe he thinks they’ll continue going up
Premium was $0.23, so $23 per call

20 calls x $23 = $460

Unless im missing context, I dont see anything wrong except maybe piss poor wording?
[removed]
Treat your God with respect
Hope so.
Eh, I made the same play after getting 2013 TSLA vibes. I was there when it ran from 30 -> 180 and had a feeling it was going to happen again. Since that time revenue had 6x-Ed and delivered profitability and built a factory in 11 months, while the stock price stayed flat due to bad press and Elon hitting a joint on joe Rogan, it had no right to be trading at $300 this time last year.

I also had these same contracts because I though we had a 20% chance of hitting $1,000 pre-split and returning 100x.  20% chance at 100x is amazing odds.

I wasn’t saying it would happen, just that it could and the market wasn’t valuing TSLA or it’s options correctly, which was entirely true. You don’t predict a stock price will move, you predict that it has a reasonable chance to and you put a small portion of your portfolio in the unthinkable happening and returning >100x
ya everything points to it being possible
Puts or calls
How are you even going to know what the top is that far out?
FSLY calls might be the move. Chart starting to pick up steam and now the CISCO buyout rumour.
140
10k shares, the view from outer space will be awesome  🚀

Guess the MMs decided to increase the prices of options across the board since there are so many retail buyers this year. You pretty much can't find any 2 years LEAPs for under a few hundred regardless of how cheap or shitty the underlying is. Admittedly while I invested in stocks in the past, I didn't start using options until this year so I have no idea how cheap they were just a few years ago but it still seems mindblowing they could have been that cheap. I wonder if we'll ever return to a time like that once the majority of the retail investors lose their money when the bull run is over or if this is simply how it is now.
ya idk i've only seen his stream 3 or 4 times

>My indicators are really good as long as the central banks aren’t monkeying with the economy so dramatically [as they have been]. In late 2008, early 2009, they turned on the endless money spigot. But we can’t keep having artificial stimulus.

I love how his entire premise is based on the idea that the fed won't do what they've been doing for 12+ years, and have been doing in overdrive for the past 9 months. This is considered smart money?

That chat room can have some up to the minute news reports. But everyone else is straight up a child or a clown in there.

Unironically one of my most highly prized pieces of advice from WSB was to start small, be willing to lose at first, and consider those losses to be like paying for tuition. A few hundred or even a few thousand bucks lost can be worth it if you learn from your mistakes, and I totally agree that just doing it is more helpful than studying it, not just because you have to actually figure out the mechanics on your own, but because having skin in the game means you learn your lessons with real emotional responses.

I had a financial derivatives professor in college who repeatedly recommended against holding spreads through expiry. Must have heard this guy say that line dozens of times. What actually TAUGHT me to not hold through expiry was getting caught between two legs of an expiring vertical credit spread and eating a $1,400 loss on a spread with a “max loss” of $100.
Fuck that bitch man. Wall that off and don’t look back. You’re too high value to fuck with that floozy shit

Sell covered puts on stocks you want to own till you get assigned. Then sell covered calls on the stock till you get assigned. You’ll see “theta gang” posts fairly frequently around here, it’s selling options for the premium you get from the sale. It’s usually less risky and can pay pretty well but you won’t see the huge returns like the gain porn posts here. 

I use market chameleon to find high volatility stocks, which are usually meme stocks, and sell options on them. It’s been pretty successful so far
Nothing it’s fake
Valid points, and I admit I’ve been surprised by how resistant the market has been to bad news. However, I think the scenes of despair this winter have a decent chance of breaking through. 

My reasoning is this: virtually NONE of the big uptick in cases/hospitalizations/deaths we’ve seen the past couple of weeks have been from Thanksgiving. As bad as it is now, we are still operating with pre-holiday numbers—which have a decent chance of exploding sometime in the middle of this coming market week. 

Meanwhile, many hospitals are already approaching capacity. In some states like Alabama, 1/3 ICU patients have COVID—that number can only go up in the short term.  My mom is a doctor, and the medical community where I live is at a breaking point. There is a consensus opinion among physicians that a lot of people are going to die because there just isn’t enough medical staff. It’s less about the number of beds—more about having someone to flip you over when you can’t breathe. Vaccines aren’t going to be widely available for most hospitalists until well into January, which means nurses will be getting sick at the exact moment when they’re most needed. 

TLDR: Virus gonna get so bad, I think it might (temporarily) overshadow vaccine news.

People are calling this fake.  How about screenshot of your graph for the naysayers.
❤️
Why not?
Interesting perspective. IMO, it ends when the 10%-20% dip people have been conditioned to buy doesn't immediately turn around and head to all time highs. Instead, over a period of weeks and months, there's a sharp rally and then it drops 5% below the low, rallies again, then drops 5% below that low and so on...all of a sudden passive investing won't look so hot.

The question is whether dumb money inflows into the market are significantly large enough to move prices higher indefinitely. I suspect, no. In fact, I think large sized futures traders can completely tank the market at any point as their selling can pressure arbitrage funds to sell the underlying stocks and kick off a feedback loop. It's happened before on a smaller scale, to this guy:

In 1997, Niederhoffer Investments was not finding many opportunities for investments and, having returned much of its funds to customers such as George Soros, began investing the remaining 100 million dollars in areas where Niederhoffer later admitted that he did not have much expertise.[19] Niederhoffer decided to buy Thai bank stocks, which had fallen heavily in the Asian financial crisis, his bet being that the Thai government would not allow these companies to go out of business. On October 27, 1997, losses resulting from this investment, combined with a 554-point (7.2%) single-day decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the eighth[20] largest point decline to date in index history), forced Niederhoffer Investments to close its doors. ***In a lawsuit that Niederhoffer later filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where he traded options, he alleged that floor traders colluded to drive the market down that day to force him out of his positions. *** Traders at the time said Refco may have been responsible for as much as $35 million of Niederhoffer's losses.[21]

A call is an option contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified amount of an underlying security at a specified price within a specified time. The specified price is known as the strike price and the specified time during which a sale is made is its expiration or time to maturity.

He probably bought a cheap contract that expires months later where he decided to execute. I.e. price was like $40/share, someone sold him a contract for the price of $1-2/share that expires a year later
This guy fucks
this literally makes no sense to me. the amount of stock you have, the price you bought it at, the timeframe. literally none of it

Doesn't make sense to drive half an hour, do half an hour of shopping and drop off one order an hour. So you have 3-4 shoppers in-store, one person driving, that's one team.

Tesla is what got me into option trading. I first learned about it at low 300s. Finally learned everything I needed to know about option trading as it was ripping into the 400s. Decided to not buy in because it seemed like a meme stock that everyone was FOMOing into.
Why didn't he sell when it was $30? He belongs here.

y is every saying its fake tho. last year i bought 2 x 230c leaps presplit. wouldve been worth 554,000 had i not sold ...
The more reality sets in, the less stocks like this will pump. This is all based on speculation and grandeur. For example, anything related to EVs, business in space, quantum computing, or any highly disruptive technology will pump hard based on any news that makes it closer to reality. Once reality sets in and products are on the market (assuming there aren't more reasons to speculate, ie tsla's situation), that is when the real valuations take effect (ie crash of dot com). My guess is if any of their pre clinical work makes it to clinical trial they will run hard, just like CRSP did.
As far as I can tell, these are naked options, meaning that he has bought contracts which give him an option (literally) to buy the shares at a predetermined price.

Now, that predetermined price has been exceeded by a humongous margin, many multiples, so if he simply exercises those options to buy shares at that HEAVILY DISCOUNTED price, and then sells those shares at a CURRENT MARKET price, he would make almost a million dollars, as you can see from the screenshot.

In a parallel universe where TSLA isn't a meme-stock of 2020, and that predetermined price had not been met, the option to buy the shares at a higher price than the market price would simply expire worthless, meaning that he would lose that $500 he bought the option for.

I might be wrong on all this, I never bought a single option in my life, but that's how I understand this whole thing.

Look at IV on SNOW. Gonna sell some calls Monday or Tuesday. I know, I know, they just had blowout earnings where they, blew more money than expected.

The people who go out of their way to tip and argue from their high horse that we need to tip are usually shut up when i ask them how often they tip their local grocery cashier or fast food worker or department store worker. Started with the depression and the customer got stuck with footing their salaries ever since. It's bs. Pay them better.

If they had any type of draw to actually hire influential people, they would already be big.

Fuck blackberry suck on deez berries
I guess. I feel like there will be some market wide incident that leaves ETF holders positively fucked and passive investors will have to re-orient from the “stonk do good so we weight it more/less” idea that it’s built on now. That may bring back more of a focus on fundamentals.

Also I feel the increase in active trading from COVID may accelerate it. Everyone sees retards making money just throwing money around and it may swing some money out of index funds. 

The problem with that is that there are a lot of millennials who have bit the “put $5 a day into an index and you’ll be a millionaire by retirement” personal finance shit that will keep driving passive investing.


I guess I really have no clue but until weighting in passive investing changes we’re stuck with a market like this. Also I feel there will HAVE to be some collapse because “free” long term tendies from giving your money to vanguard or schwabb sounds like just the kind of thing to fuck everyone over

Really? You're going to say this after finding out how many times your ex faked an orgasm?
He didn’t, he bought *the right to purchase the shares for $135 each* and securing that right cost him $0.23 per share.  

So the $460 is what it cost him to buy that *right*.  That was the cost of the contract, not of the shares.  

He doesn’t have to actually buy the shares, he just purchased the right to do it if he wants to. Basically he paid that $460 to some people for *the right to buy their TSLA stock at $135 per share until JAN15 of next year.*

So if he doesn’t end up buying them (which would be incredibly stupid in this case), he just loses his $460.  

If he does end up buying them, he needs to pay $135 a share ($250k total), but he’s paying that amount for something currently worth $1200K.  

The price of the contract is why there’s a value there called “break even price”.  That’s the price of the share + the price of the contract.  The share price must exceed that sum in order for the contract to be worth it for OP.
Chill, all he meant is that it is missing a 0.
You do you. Lots of people saying "$100" on the short squeeze. Not saying it's not possible, I'm just being conservative.
It was a simple gamma squeeze, the price had nothing to do with the real value of the underlying lol.

OK guys i just reviewed the option history for that TSLA post and apparently on 7/25/2019 the day of the lowest sale, there was a filled order at $0.15 for his strike and date. Adjusting for the split that sale was actually $0.75 pre-split but this makes the post very possible. Many days those calls were going for around $1.00 pre-split. Fucking insane

**[Charging Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging Bull)**

Charging Bull, sometimes referred to as the Wall Street Bull or the Bowling Green Bull, is a bronze sculpture that stands on Broadway just north of Bowling Green in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. The 7,100-pound (3,200 kg) bronze sculpture, standing 11 feet (3.4 m) tall and measuring 16 feet (4.9 m) long, depicts a bull, the symbol of aggressive financial optimism and prosperity. Charging Bull is a popular tourist destination that draws thousands of people a day, symbolizing Wall Street and the Financial District. The sculpture was created by Sicilian artist Arturo Di Modica in the wake of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash.

Why are people so obsess with diversity? How about company hire people base on merit.
It wasn’t, the stock has since been split so it’s price dropped by 4x but number of shares went up by 4x

Also the math isn’t corroborating OPs story, and I’m pretty sure he made this up

Dont know if you are meming or not. But I highly recommend you look at the option post that was made here a week ago thats basically dummy proof. Then watch some videos on youtube there are some good ones. I’m not really the person to give advice. Also learn the greeks and dont buy Weeklies unless you seriously want to gamble. Monthlies are usually better. You have more time and the theta doesn’t murder you
They said in an earlier ER that they’re not giving guidance for this quarter, so guidance would just be a surprise at that point

You'll be richer than me but I def bought more than 1,000 shares so wanna be friends lol
The charts that you should be using to trade.
Don't have children, fine, I don't. No complaints here, but when you get all uppity about it and start using words like "breeders" and act like you've got some sort of moral superiority it takes a lot for me to not gut you on the spot.
How does this relate i read it and I’m still confused
You think there’s enough volume pre market 21st for them to buy the bulk ?

Or do you think they’d risk billions in litigation not being able to buy the full amount by 21st?
Fuck it. I'm in.
Yeah f that; $11k for the Jan/2023 $1200 -- must be out of their minds
Ummm yeah sure. 23 dollars a contract that is a year and a half out for Tesla. Fake and gay.
I mean, this isn't exactly breaking news.  You're told from the beginning all your money goes into the G-Fund unless you indicate otherwise.

This age of FOMO is tempting. So many SPACs and IPOs coming up. Nevermind all the meme stonks. I got burned on PLTR buying at the top but I'll probably still get a couple of shares of GME for earnings.

Thanks for the comment. How do you see how much stocks is held by institutions? Where can I find that information?
I don’t see how.
That's exactly me with BCLI right now. Now I only need it to pop the 13x and I'm all set. Let me tell you, it's all but a done deal.
I'm also an options retard here. What exactly did OP pay for those options?
Mavic air?
Just go check it out it fell under the 20 sma and 50 sma Friday and has increased bearish volume selling into close hard candles, we’ll see PM Monday if it holds and moves above 46 it will start going up quick again barring trump signing in that order to delist
ive been looking for 4-5x otm leaps and haven't seen one yet, I don't think its real but im a retard so

My average cost is 24.32. The financials don't lie, so I wonder if something else is up with the company.
Barring a major market/industry downtrend, I'd say CRM is safe entry point. Might run up to 230 quickly. If it breaks and holds stable above 230 then 260ish would be my next target.  


Long term its definitely a solid hold.
Which charts? Can you link ?
Options, it’s basically gambling, not the sane as buying stocks, a 1% drop in price can end you
Site admins already ban you if you use the word f@g, so you're probably correct.

Before the open the 21st. They’re not buying the 18th, they’re buying before open the 21st.
Nice post and I agree that INTC is definitely one of them.  I got burned on the second leg down because I thought the initial earnings reaction was a bit much and entered then, but the second one seemed absurd.  I've since more than doubled down and turned a hefty profit.  

It's a pretty simple approach.  Of course you still need to know what it is that you're buying, how they're going to make money, and why their share price should increase, but finding and buying LEAPs on strong companies with low IV has definitely been a winner for me for a while now.

Bro, you can't make a post like this without mentioning gamma and gamma risk. People like you don't realize, along with most of WSB, that they are long gamma traders essentially. It's how you get hundreds of percent gains, which is what we are after in this sub.

Why not sell 1 or 2 ATM or slightly OTM covered calls instead, 30-45 DTE?
This way you make some profit if price goes down, if price moons then you get all the premium so your effective selling price was higher than if you just sold the shares.
I’m also long the same calls... They aren’t dead yet

Did I miss something? Did Fed step in and take over how each state will handle distribution? I thought Ole Joe said he's leaving it to the states to decide.... today. (?)

EDIT: unless you are talking about distributions TO states which is different but still dont see how Walgreen's plays in that

“Speaking as an analyst, I would like nothing more than to see an S-1 from Stripe, but it sounds like it’s not coming anytime soon (and I can state with a high degree of confidence that Stripe will not be doing a SPAC with any of its rumored suitors); the company is reportedly raising more money, but is increasingly spending the money it raises on acquisitions and investments (one would certainly assume that the core payments business is not only profitable but also has a very attractive cash conversion cycle).”

I'm fucking retarded. I have a bunch of holds I want to liquidate to buy calls in my hold brokerage, and I was freaking out calculating the commission on top of the premium instead of per contract. Still sucks to pay a commission, but worth it to not have to wait to move all the money.

If vaccine news caused a sector rotation then lockdown 2.0 would cause a rotation back. 

I'd also double down on pharmaceutical plays because it will put more focus on getting a vaccine out.

That said I wouldn't bet on COVID being worse than expected. This market has proven a dozen times a month since March it doesn't care about infection rates, death rates, etc.

nope, sorry to disappoint you. it’s a reference to a song by ace hood. Mama need a house, baby need some shoes, times are getting hard, guess what I’m gonna do?
Gotcha thanks for clearing that up. If I can ask one more question. So when you write a covered call you want it to match your shares. So 500 shares would mean 5 covered calls. Is it the same with selling puts or is the short position I'm opening independent of those shares?

Ok, let me clarify one thing about this play. Hold this like your are the Michael Scott of the Big Short.
looks like my bipolar cycle
It is sickening how you people delude yourself.
Anyone who has to question something this thoroughly, same goes for if you have to make up or engineer this, is a deeply insecure person, and your doubt and  insecurity will stop you from being successful because you will always be questioning if it's real. You can't see or suspect somebody of something unless you are capable of doing that thing yourself. So if you suspect this guy of lying it is only because you are capable of and know how it would be done.

I actually really like this play starting off, but wouldn’t mind pulling profits at 50% and trimming down to 1/3 original holdings and match it to be evenly levered with puts when the strike prices are similar.

It's garbage. Has 0 consumer stimulus. 

Conservatives are just trying really hard to pass lawsuit immunity for employers making workers work through dangerous conditions.

We don't need more PPP when 500 billion was unused from previous stimulus and what was used was taken by big boys. 

My family's small business didn't receive a dime of that. What they did get was PUA, and state and county grants.

I personally look for anything below 30% to be considered low.

I think most traders would say 20% or lower, but we live in a high IV environment a lot... 

You have to weigh risk vs reward and do your research properly on the stock and what analysts say, if you find a low IV stock trading at low levels and premiums are cheap then consider buying their LEAP contracts if the delta and vega and other greeks look good with the big picture

No possible way. I was looking at TSLA LEAPs in 2019 for 2021 expiry. The furtherest out and furtherest OTM was not that cheap or I would have been all over it just for time value. Nobody would sell that far out for just $0.23 or even $1.15 pre-split.
Yeah that's what I meant. Something that brings down an entire sector not just semiconductors

for some reason, completely forgot to make use of stop losses...

the funny thing is OP is completely right. Its fucking insane to buy these EV stocks and literally in A DAY going up 50% but nice thing is that given these high gains, setting a stop loss of 15% is fine. You still win and avoid a potential crush. 

Maybe keep the companies that based on DD can actually turn a profit.
Yea I am aware of the tax incentive for holding over a year but I just can’t imagine be ever being able to hold off like that lol. I mean for 500 in vested, I would have thought 10 grand was a steal and move on, let alone all the way to a million. Congratulations

>  
>Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March - enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time.

>Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales - a tenth of Berkshire's revenue - and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

Not really. Their market cap is 40 bill. Compare that to TD at 100 bill.

Except TD averages 2-3 bill in net income each Q. Rkt does around 50 mill. And they don't offer a 5% dividend.

What calls would you buy if you knew COVID was going to get WAY worse than the market expects?

Shit they even got vaults
I mean.... I am a little jealous. That doesn’t make it an educated trade, it was still retarded. Again, someone wins the lottery, but that doesn’t mean the risk vs reward was worth it. 

Let’s say you get an invitation to play a game. There’s 100 players, and the pot is $100. Let’s say everyone has the same chance of winning. How much would you be willing to pay to play this game? At $1, if you could play the game a thousand times, you would in theory break even. At $2 if you could play the game a thousand times, you would pay $2,000 and you would win 1/100 times, so 10 and thus make $1,000. This produces a loss of $1,000. 

Now, let’s say that you for some reason decided to pay $10 to play this game 1,000 times, your expected loss is $9,000. Let’s say that you defied the odds, and you managed to win the game 150 times, when statistics say you only should have won 10 times. You would profit $5,000. 

Does that make it wise? No. Am I jealous? Yes. Is OP potentially retarded and more than likely to lose all of his money if he continues to play the losing game of paying $10 when break even is only $1? Yes. 

That’s why you see tons of people telling OP to cash out and never look back. Because although you can skate the odds sometimes (i enjoy blackjack every now and again even though I’m certain to lose in the long run), it will eventually catch up with you, and you will lose.

So... stick to poker. And if you can’t tell who the shmuck at the table is, it’s probably you. Looking at you, idiot whom I’m explaining this to.
You know you want it
anyone have an option they want me to look up the history of and i'll tell you its greatest gain/loss?

Telus is actually one of the smaller telco in canada. Bell and Roger's are the main players I would say and then you got telus and videotron. Also they mostly say BellUs as lots of people think they are in bed together . Also side note; telus put all their chips on Huawei while bell uses Nokia or Huawei so it huawei is restricted bell has a backup and telus doesn't...

just out of curiosity, couldn't you just look at the price of the option with 0.2x the strike price post split to find the actual current value?
Putting a high sell limit doesn't prevent anything. Unless you have the paper certificate saying you own the shares, your brokerage is the owner, the monetary value is shown in your account as a share amount for transparency. They aren't your shares and chances are none of us will ever truly "own" our shares. Its not a bad thing tho.  I just don't want this information spreading around when it's false, I've seen it several times.

That means there are 920 million abused children on PornHub!!!!" and other stupid shit like that.

Asking for a friend
You can trade on webull from your phone.
PTON SNAP MSFT CALLS 12/11 = free money
Very low. I’ve had relatives in their 60s get it and survive, my friends grandpa in a nursing home also was hospitalized but survived. The wild thing is that some people in these “high risk” categories pull through just fine, and others do not. Treatments are better now than before, if they started monitoring him early he has better chances
Lol. It was supposed to be 80$ then increased to 120$ and opened at 245$. So yeah, it is up almost 500% to expected IPO price. TAM is not even that much compared to their MC. This is becoming like grand daddy to Tesla and Zoom. FYI, Buffet bought at 80$ a pop, people who buy at 400$ is a real clown.
Yep which is why I broke it down earlier, numbers seem legit to me tbh
They're real, and listed price is closing price on the option on Friday. Either a very good photoshop is this guy won the lotto

You will never have to work again in your life if you don’t want to. Put all of that into long term investments like SPY or VTI and you have paid for your whole life if you can budget. You have such an amazing opportunity from this. Great job. And fuck you.

Oh fuck
Nio 12/11 switch to calls if the trendline holds
Looking at something similarly priced to TSLA back then, it's looking more plausible. GD($156 today) Jan 2022 280c or +80% can be had for an ask of $0.60. It's concievable, if improbable, that you could catch TSLA on a down day for what OP claimed. Premiums were decently lower before the 2020 madness. Maybe OP isn't a bundle of sticks. Still skeptical, though - re: wsbgod.
I bought some 12/18s on Friday though

The worse part about dying from ARDS is your immune system overacts to the virus and the immune response creates flammation inside the lung. Fluids from the immune response will slowly fill up the individual alveolis( basically small air sacks where oxygen exchange happens). Patient generally suffocates slowly and drowns under his own bodily fluids. Mechanical ventilation won’t be necessary at that point since the endotracheal tube is just pumping air down to a swimming pool. I told my professor during our ventilator conversion project this thing is basically useless. Once you are on a ventilator, chances are you not gonna make it.

Telus is a dividend stock and a relatively safe one cause of how incompetent the Canadian government is when it comes to regulating the telecommunications sector. Literally the big 3 companies are milking the shit out of the consumers every way possible. It’s disgusting how a hot deal for a plan would be 20gb for 60 bucks/month. That being said don’t expect it to grow much or even grow at all but it’s paying a good 5% dividend a year but I doubt people here would actually buy into this after all this place is a casino not some boomer subreddit like r/investing

Cash out 1/1/21.  Or hold out to 1/15/21, no risk of major loss porn with this.  It's basically like you own 2000 shares.  And then divers-a-fuck-afy.  Unless your rich and have lots of other positions and your just showing out.  Tesla has very little room to grow and lots of risk to drop as they have insane expectations to meet each and every quarter.  They have a market cap $560 billion in a sector EV's that by 2025 will have a total addressable market of between $200 billion and $500 billion depending on speed of adoption.  So even at the most optimistic end that means Tesla has to sell 100% of all EVs sold in 2025 to justify their market cap.

Meanwhile their secretary Jeannie is still half naked in the copier room doing her nails and checking tinder, waiting for the two pump chump to get back and finish the job.

Also you can take one look at a lot and know which businesses are owned by scumbags and which are decent people. You've only got yourself to blame if you buy from the former.

Any ideas as to what could be expected, price target wise, out of EDIT in the next year or so? Been eyeing them for a few months now. How would you guess that they might compare to a comparable investment in CRSP in that time frame? 

Given what Ive been led to believe is the potential of the cas9 tool in the years to come (and thats quite a lot of potential even if being extremely conservative in the considerations), I cant help but think that all stocks related to its use will (on the whole) see a rise, so in a way, any investment in the a company utilizing it will pay out to some degree. But, having spent some time watching how the market seems to treat these things, I am somewhat afraid that that the best gains might be missed by not investing in the stock that goes by the same name as the technology itself (at least in common parlance).
appreciate it

Bro ...I know a lot of nurses 

If u ask me if I wanted to be a nurse making 70-120k 

Or a home deport or Lowe’s floor worker making 15$ a hour 

I would pick home deport

The way of the retar I see
Fomo now before earninga
I would say ARKG, get some exposure to growth opportunities not found in the others. Not that it’s a bad thing but ARKQ is 10%+ tsla just like ARKK and ARKW.
This is the kind of dd I look for here
And then $40mm! Then $80mm!
So for .23c you bought 100 contracts that gives you the option to buy what? At expiration?
Who's going all in on AQB with me on monday? Let's pump some land salmon boys.
Every time I see those GoT shitposts, I just start watching the show instead of reading your shit as subs.

Thank you for the VO
Yes
Lets us know when they get done with the nursing homes (hint: March at earliest) and good luck cutting in front of those folks if not already rich.
Thanks man, I feel the same way. Just hoping I could provide some stats or something to cheer him up.
i think it’s called government shutdown actually lol it happened last year bro
IF the stock just keeps going way up then yeah but WHEN it doesn't then you are fucked cuz you're 1/15 call will be worthless
If he bought the contracts from a market maker or other professional, they hedged with a long position in the underlying. So they are delta neutral and don’t care which way the price goes. The ones who would lose in the end would be short sellers who sold those hedge shares to the market maker. Could be one guy or it could be distributed among 100 traders.
I’ve been on the BB train for a while now for these exact reasons. I always get the same bullshit responses about being outdated, shit phones, etc. It blows my mind how so many are blind to what the company currently is versus what it used to be. Might as well call it BerryX, because this stock is building rockets to the moon!
Check out my reply to the other guy. That’s my reasoning behind it.
yeah , nah , maybe , but wtvr the case expect the poor to get left out.
I'm in exactly the same position as you bro and the problem I've got is if it's such an obvious thing to happen and it 'literally cannot go tits up' then the opposite will happen and the mf will carry on going up.

Maybe sell half like a boomer.

Gotta step up to the glory hole
If he would have had more money invested.... would there be enough money on earth to pay out this account? How would that be handled if e.g. 20k would have been invested?
Yes please
Thanks man. I appreciate it. Couldn’t imagine losing my father so soon. It’s gotta be stressful knowing it could happen any day.
Your son will die to Achilles eh? Ouch.
But then he won’t be able to tell his wife’s boyfriend that he’s a day trader
Seems to be working *so far*
Dont exercise them man...you destroy your extrinsic value by doing so. If you want to take some profits, just sell however many you want to get rid of and take in the full value of the contracts
Why not just hold it...
Look at the option chart. It’s all there
I started on cash app and came over to rh.  People payed me for something in cash app I bought stocks.  No options and limited stocks pushed me away
That’s a good question; you’ll thank me for maybe brightening your day by imprinting a great ticker in your brain before the new week starts? Idk hahah
sure but it's a step closer

Literally like a week later. Nothing was even turning down or looking bad at all.  I just sat around reading coronavirus news and reading about the last time we had a pandemic and decided I didn’t believe my original thesis for buying anymore.

This is fucked. Ever since I started trading, I can’t enjoy my weekends anymore because I can’t wait for the market to open. But when the market is open I have work and can’t wait for the weekend. No part of my life is enjoyable now.
Agree. In most markets it is 100% a grift. Our last one recommended a mortgage guy then he tried to make me pay him for his own mistake. Fuck you guy.

Can you link those sources? I'm skeptical they were 0.23 at the time he bought them (4x price contracts for ~1.5 years away on Tesla seems too cheap to be true).

Never buy calls while it is going up or you’re overpaying. You make the most money by catching falling knives and watching it rebound to support or resistance levels. I learned this when I lost shit tons of money on Tiffany puts trying to play the wave.

So your education and your life?
Huge catalyst, while everyone is focused on vaccine development by Pfizer and Moderna, Walgreens is super low key and they just got a contract to vaccine every single elderly person nationwide. They are going to see tremendous volume in customers and are going to bank out on vaccine shots. Everyone is all hyped on the vaccine but they aren’t looking at the bigger picture. Distribution of shots and logistics. Walgreens will be a monster! And it’s super cheap right now.
Things always turn out alright when the market goes straight up and we're all irrationally exuberant, right?

Yes i see now. Your comment is correct and that post should get removed. I find it odd that mods haven’t come out and verified it being legit if it was. This feels like some shady stuff is going on again like last time with previous mods
So why do you think they will jump 15-20% by close on Monday?
very possible to keep running up until the merger but very unlikely. There's bound to be an entry point leading up to the 21st. No need to FOMO into things, let this cramer new/FOMOing pass.
You okay?

No. That would have been like 2 shares pre split so around $2400 if I just bought shares. Not bad but quite different

> Of course, the bottom line is that lots of things people considered eminently logical in 1999 – like low-risk triple-digit gains – are now being shown to have been far too good to be true. The headlines of 1999 look silly now, and the debunking in 2000 seems obvious (e.g., "What Are Tech Stocks Worth, Now That We Know It Isn't Infinity?" in the Wall Street Journal on April 17). But that's a juxtaposition that marks the end of every market boom.

In WSB the winner takes it all, assume 1,000 people start YOLO with 10k then after 1 year their asset will be geometrically distributed after 5M taken by MM and hedge funds.

Haha gains are gains. Because of all the gains we see here we have survivorship bias, but those 1000%+ gains over a long period of time are really rare. Don't go into options with money that you are not prepared to lose.

You noob, TSLA has a 5x higher market cap. Literally 107.5b vs 558b, member, prior to split Tesla would be at $3,000 rn($600 stonk price) and another offering coming... stop it.
That's what I'm on now. Just discovered they had all of them.
Me: retarded
but
My theory: ?
enjoy the virus
Big question to me is what TSLA will do when it’s finally included in the S&P. Less volatility I’m guessing, but potentially a lower share price as well? I’m not sure. I like the company and I like Elon Musk, so I’m diamond handing my shares, but it’s tempting to take some profit now.

Market watch has it estimated to be $44-50 a share.
Bummer. Presumably after the merger?
My good friend from back in 2016 was putting as much as he could into TSLA stocks. We worked at a fedex together so decent money an He had like 8k in them at the time i think, bet he’s doing really well now.
PLTR 12/11s. They’re all going to print.
It’s low
Rocket under 20 is such a fucking awesome value.

Naturally rocket 15 next week.

I bought Jan calls that were cheap as fuck Friday right before close.
This is the reason I will never stop losing money to options ......fuck
JKS should be interesting. If the results are at all positive I could easily see it breakout big. I'm an idiot though and didn't realize earnings was premarket so I sold at 63 Friday morning when I noticed the down trend and didn't buy back in since I was busy at work.

I'll give you a reason: it's state by state, not federal orders.
wtf is this? You just encourage retards to pretend to have more shares than they do so you can delude them into the sense that they own a significant portion of the company? This is borderline market manipulation

If i had awards to give, you would have just earned one.
why didnt you just take it to hector to see if he could fix it?
Being fit has little to do with income. Frozen veggies, protein powder, chicken, etc would cost you about the same amount of what you spend right now. A gym membership helps, but there’s a million forms of exercise outside of the gym. Take an hour of your day usually spent on Reddit, watching TV, etc. and put it toward exercise. It’s really that easy. Just learn discipline
They did buy it. Just bought it cheap
Why not just post a recording of your chart?
As an investor, that only makes me feel better. Fiscal prudence for the win!
Best: bought 6000 shares PLTR at $10
Worst: bought 20000 shares PLTR at $17

My worst might still work out. LFG
Haven’t had that happen yet
buying my own ski resort in the mountains. make lift tickets cheap and amenities few, but have my own mansion in the woods tucked away near the base lodge.
I owned 1000 shares of a $5 stock for 2 years and sold it at $18. Crazy solid gain, but 6 months later and it’s worth $43. I don’t get how people hold through such already solid returns.

remember that line “Joe Kennedy pulled out of the stock market in 1929 when his shoeshiner started giving him stock tips”? Yeah, I think that’s where we’re at rn.
Probably some battery day type shit
Okay but why are you still holding? You'd get higher returns from holding shares at this point
WYNN calls?
or 3 weekends ago
I’m not sure youtube would like that
I work in the field. Ive used CRISPR for many years in my day to day research. When CRSP formed as a company I scoffed at the idea because from a scientific perspective, we know the enzyme (cas9) that does the cutting to edit the genome will induce 1000s of cuts randomly throughout the genome, this happens even with high fidelity engineered cas9s too. I figured that without fixing this aspect of the system these random mutations would have serious effects in humans. We see this happen in cell culture and some times in mice too... I was a hater, and now I'm outside looking in. 

That said, I think BEAM and EDIT have a lot of room to grow. BEAM's tech results in less off target mutations, so I like them a lot more. Their market cap is around 3B at the moment, and they just ran pretty hard Wednesday-Friday, so if they cool off a bit next week I'll look to pick up some shares.
How do I do this?
Squeeze question: Short on cash rn, but want in on the 04/20 calls. Technically I could buy earlier calls (01/20) to get a cheaper premium and just keep rolling them forward to spread out my costs to buy in right? I realize my overall premium might be higher in the long run, but I could afford more contracts until I free up some cash. As long as stock keeps going up I’m good?

Still relatively new here, so feel free to f me in the face if I don’t sound retarded enough
They’re worse man. Car salesmen are known to be shitty and people look down on them. Plus most barely make enough live. Realtors are millionaires for no reason. Selling a car you have to let the fucker test drive it and risk your life everyday letting some fucking retard drive. 

Also ya there are some apps etc for House sales, but like here in Vancouver, they have a monopoly and have control over certain things. Can’t really go without one. The rules need to change.
But what about when they suck you off to make the sale like in the movies

I don’t think a moderate stay at home order will effect the market that much. But the trend is not looking good. The thanksgiving spike is already so obvious and the saddest part is, the trend was going down until last week.
Not sure that’s thats true
Do mods still require proof of big gain/loss porn screenshots ?

Why has there been no verification of that guy who claims to have bought $460 worth of TSLA calls a year ago that printed $1.2M gross ?

I did some research and it seems I misunderstood how to read times and sales. Times and sales are 1:1. It is the Level II data that's 1:100. So it was 900,000 and 200,000 shares.
I saw red when I opened my portfolio.

I don't think I'm going to YOLO anymore.
Anyone actually knows what the fuck is gonna happen to Tesla that is the clusterfuck called 18th of December? I have no clue as to what kind of volumes should be trading, whether funds have already been buying, and what options are gonna do to the stock price.

Maybe. Depends on the person I guess. Humans are also hardwired to dislike pain more than they like pleasure. It’s a survival instinct thing. I got to the point a long time ago that big up and down swings do almost nothing to excite or scare me. I just think logically for the most part about money now. 80k up or down some days is fine either way as long as my monthly net change is going up or flat.

That’s stupid honestly mate.
Yeah, commissions are ridiculous in Canada. IBKR is the only one remotely competitive with the US. 1 cent per share, with a $1 minimum capping at 0.5% of the trade value. $1.5 per contract

Still not amazing, but actually usable for trading compared to how other Canadian brokers rip

I think if someone can pull $136 strike premium chart going back to summer 2019 and verify if it was trading $1.15 is the only way we can confirm his post is real.

i've been buying stocks that i see Cathie's ark investing in later which is a confidence booter.  if i had more money i would buy arrival bc the company has a lot to offer.  when it was announced i was bummed bc i didnt have a lot of money to purchase knowing it was going to skyrocket. i was eyeing them way before the merger announced and was hoping it was psth.. 

anyway i wish i had started a lot sooner.  we are all very fortunate to be buying during the green industrial revolution.  so many good companies.  wish i had more money.

I haven’t seen the data to prove it but i am pretty positive those options didn’t exist. Also the decimal place is off next to the 0.23 compared to everything else in the picture.

Your right, but there won't be stimulus checks.
Two days on IPO?
Except if this squeezes it will shoot to at least $50 I’m guessing. I wouldn’t even be shocked if we blew past $100. I have a small portfolio too, but every share locked up counts.

/u/Jgq123 Please listen, you’ve been gambling with meme stocks bro. You did well, but at least pull out your initial investment. Maybe even take out twice that, and invest the extra portion into more memes.

Looks like you’re entering a bull run.  Godspeed retard
If 10 cent calls for 5$ and stock doesn't make it then the original investment is entirely lost yes?

That is not a play of just some random person getting lucky. This is somebody from upper echelon of tesla company itself, that already has had info. If you think otherwise, you are a fucking moron.

The gains on a ROTH IRA are tax free (max contribution 6k/yr; 7k/yr if 50+ yrs old) but you can’t withdraw from account without penalty except under certain circumstance/condition. (Ex: reach 59.5 yrs of age, spending due to COVID, and maybe school, house, medical bills, etc.)

Is this similar to the Canadian account or can you withdraw for any reason at any time with no penalty?

Edit to say ROTH IRA is a thing in the United States.
I would have asked for $3 to take the controller.

I know pltr is getting abit old round these parts, but ive been absolutely raped by covids economic destruction this year, and i ended up having to decimate my savings just to cover rent and new deposits etc, the one thing i have left is 80 pltr shares i bought at 9.90 the day after IPO. its the entirety of my remaining etoro portfolio, so ive uninstalled it, moving to Interactive Brokers to resume investing next year when im not absolutely unemployed as fuck, and im planning on just forgetting about it in the hope that 3-5 years i can be this lucky.

They totally changed their company, they make software and data analytics for car companies to use mostly focused on ev and self driving. They also make 1 billion in revenue and are valued at 4 billion? They are sitting on a lot of cash and have beat earnings frequently and will again. They are way undervalued. Their technology will be in most cars
Yeah i've seen some posts since then like https://imgur.com/uXO0nyf one. numbers can fit even if unlikely. However, other things are a bit sus tho, like his total gains are missing parts, some post on photoshop accusations. He could definitely post better proof on his purchases

Statements like this 'Since November 1, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has doubled; since October 1, it has tripled.' should be independent of the source. It's strange that people believe such rises when they are PLTR stock prices, but not when they are hospitalization numbers...

he said the word "tranche" so he might have money maybe
It ain't like that pal. I want to believe it's real, but the math seems so questionable, and it appears to be photoshopped.
So, a lot
1. Confirmation bias- People are haters and don’t want to believe it’s true. Check your bias at the door and just focus on the data. It may not make sense compared to Tesla options now, but this was an entirely different environment.
2. Tesla was not the trading vehicle that is is now. The options were not priced like this. And also the stock was beaten down at that stage, low IV and an option 200% out of the money make it very possible. This was still a $1 contact. Thats not that cheap when you think about it.
100%. Im no bear but what you "predicted" is still likely. Doesnt mean Im not leveraged with calls on margin.  I've just seen my death play out multiple different ways

Last year OP paid some poor suckers $460 for the right to buy 2000 shares of TSLA for about $135 a share, valid up until JAN 15, 2021

Those suckers thought that TSLA would either go down or not be worth $135 by that time, so they sold him that contract for really cheap

Well they are jumping off of their roofs en masse now, because TSLA did absolutely insanely well since then

TSLA share price is like $600 now.  

So now OP gets to buy 2000 shares of TSLA at $135 each from the suckers, and then sell them immediately for $600 each on the market 

He paid $460 for the right to buy $250,000 worth of stock from these guys last year, a stock which is now worth $1.2M
We need more than math, show us video or something. If it’s true, congrats and fuck you!
I think there is a $680 strike because Tesla hit $380 before it hit $180. I’m just not sure that a 680c 1.5 years out costs $1.15
Badass!  Congrats again.  NFO.
When ROKU was right around $100 in May I went all in on OTM ROKU leaps because I figured it’d never drop below 100.

I got March 2021 160C

I was super bullish because I felt ROKU was wildly undervalued compared to the rest of its market which was seeing huge growth.

It traded in a range for a while and when it finally broke out my LEAPS became ITM and I sold them when ROKU was at 170 for massive profit. 

Today my position would be worth over 1.3 million dollars.
Oh damn, you have been posting and... WSB doesn't deserve you.  Seriously, thanks for that DD.  The Nexsys and selling to their competitors is the tipping point for me. That's selling the point that they are in fact a tech company.  I'm going to pile on some more shares.

I maintain that if they could do something to better automate the title system in this country, they'd be unstoppable.  Waiting for titles is such a huge bottleneck.
I am new to investing, always considered it gambling since other than timing one doesn't have any control over what the market does BUT the older I get the more I realize since I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth the only way I'll get one is being involved. Like I said I'm up 70-x% percent but all I've done this whole time is beat myself up over every trade thinking I could have done better. I really don't know what to do. I need to learn how to give my balls a tug but everything is just so fucking intimidating, I feel like I'm going to lose even if I profit because "I COULD HAVE MADE MORE IF I WAS EARLIER/LATER/PUT MORE IN"

If $600 is a lot of money to you, you really need to take out at least half of your gains. You got lucky, and the longer you play the more likely it will be that you will lose most of it.

What does this mean? I'm a newbie.
If you've been trading for 25 years you should remember that Tesla had already gone up above $300 earlier that year, so strikes in the $600 range are not at all out of the question. From that point, it dipped below $200 for like two or three days and I remember thinking to myself I should buy some now and I didn't.

> CRM calls

Maybe, I believe that CRM is a good company, but I haven't researched them to have an informed opinion. Also the Theta is very high, I look for theta that is under -0.01 

Theta on all of the leaps for CRM are > -0.02 many are -0.04

But that doesn't mean I'm right. 

In the case of CRM you might want 3 month out expiry instead of leaps, some of those look ok, but again theta seems high on CRM options.

You're risking a large upfront premium with CRM 

If you truly believe CRM is going up and have done research on it then consider looking into these sorts of options

But I think there might be less risky options available. It's all up to how you want to play it

OC, California under 15% ICU threshold. Lockdown coming tomorrow for 3 weeks
That's interesting and I'm glad to have some data to back it up. Still doesn't make sense how the contract could be so cheap as you're still paying for extrinsic value which seems pretty standard across the board meaning more time = more money. I've closed 0DTE contracts that had 1 hour left that cost more than a $10 so maybe TSLA was priced extremely odd or I'm missing something.

How tf did u get Tesla at .23 per contract. I can’t find any deep otms for less than 5-600$
I see you are a BB bear. But I agree with you. No way Tesla themselves use BB IVY when they already roll their own.
Not this month. Feb/ Mar we may get there.
Dang. In US it’s $0 per trade and $0.65 USD per contract. Wonder if it’ll get better for y’all after Schwab takes over

I don't think you get a discount on long term capital gains for options do you? Isn't that only for actual stock not derivatives?
Better odds than a lottery ticket tho.  That is 100 pct random.  This trade has real knowledge to guide it. Now if he randomly picked any option for any stock... that would be a lottery ticket.

Presplit:
Filled for $1.15, 4 contracts = $460

Math, split adjusted (what you see in OP screenshot), the following:

$1.15 / 5 (split multiple) = .23 
4 (contracts) * 5 (split multiple) = 20 contracts, today
Well since to them Trump won in a landslide not sure how going with a pretty liberal source is going to change their mind.  Facts hardly matter anymore until its your ass on the respirator and even then the disbelief often continues.
No i am not retarded, I looked at the option prices and they are correct. I am not saying he isn’t lying, I’m just saying the evidence he has provided has no holes in it.
Most books you read on trading or 20 years old
As the stock price goes higher, so does the option price. My guess is for an OTM call of 300, for each $1 increase in stock price,  you’ll see a $20 increase in your options value (the $660). This is called the delta. As the price gets closer to 300, delta gets larger.

Longer dated options are more sensitive to IV likewise with closer to the money. Thinking IV won’t affect you because you’re long is wrong it will definitely affect you. But you have time on your side to let IV come back up again.
haha i’ll try to make it simple these were 2 year contracts with the bet that tesla would raise 300% at the time everyone was certain the company would go bankrupt so these contacts cost around $120 a piece lo and behold fast forward to today and tesla is trading 1200% higher and those contracts are deep in the money and with tesla having a 5 - 1 so did the contracts. This is the equation for why they are worth what they are https://imgur.com/a/fDL12ft

As soon as they IPO I'm in with my life savings lol. In all seriousness I would love to get a look at their financials...they take 20% of every creator's revenue but compared to something like YouTube, that is a minuscule portion

I think it will dip, no more than 10%, and then fully recover plus some by the end of the week. I only think that because it seems like almost every single stock sold off after reporting this earnings season.

I assume you’re from /r/all

First, please understand this guy basically bought lottery tickets pre-covid that just happened to print insanely.  This is not normal gains, this is absolutely insanely lucky and this guy clearly has disposable income to spend on these gambles.

He bought calls on TSLA stock last year for $0.23 per share.  Each call covers 100 shares, so each contract he bought cost him $23.  He bought 20 of those options contracts.  That’s $23 x 20.  So he paid $460 for 20 contracts (which covers 2000 shares). 

Each individual *share* value in those contracts is now *$460*.   He paid $0.23 for them, and now they are worth $460. 

**He paid $460** for call contracts that are now worth:

$460 per share x 100 shares per contract x 20 contracts  = **$930,000**

The downside to these trades is that they are basically all-or-nothing.  Either they print money or you lose your entire investment. 

So he gambled $460 that TSLA would do really really well.  And he was right, they did unpredictably well.
Are there even leaps 7 years out?

The only thing that matters is guidance.   If they announce new partnerships, share buybacks, refocusing ecommerce strategies, new board members, projected earnings for next quarter based on new gen consoles, literally anything positive for the future, THAT'S WHAT MATTERS. 

That being said, if by divine miracle they actually post a huge beat on earnings, then that's just icing on the cake.  Bit if positive earnings but future outlook is bleak, then prepare for another drawn out battle.

Thinking about returning my 5g shit cuts out
Nice. But that will already be itm at the open
here's what i don't understand - how did you have a cost basis of 0.23 when you bought options that was 2 years out in expiration? aren't those usually expensive?

Succ off a moddy mod
I know wsb avoids small miners, but look into  the uranium market.  iirc wsb has a bot that will auto-delete any ticker under $x so I won't even mention them.

Japan, the largest user of uranium, is still bringing most of their reactors online after upgrading them post-Fukushima.  Many more reactors are being built worldwide (primarily the East).  It is becoming increasingly clear that renewable technologies are not yet capable of taking the load we require of them, and we cannot continue using coal or oil like we have.  Uranium is the best 3rd option, perhaps the only 3rd option.

And it's price has been depressed for a while.  Nuclear power has been unfavored in culture for quite some time, which still has 50+ year old images of Chernobyl and 3-mile.  

During the last run-up in 2007 spot price for uranium rose sharply to 140/lb.  Today it is 30, with a low of 20 in 2017.  This is all reflected in uranium equities.  From what I've read the breakeven spot price for uranium miners is ~60, meaning right now miners are producing hardly anything.


Uranium might not pop off for a while but when it does it will go, spurred by government announcements and a sudden supply crunch.  I think it's worth buying and holding for some years.

It literally is the lottery though. You made a bet on a once in a generation like rise on Tesla and bought at exactly the right time. There’s a reason others aren’t walking around with 200,000+% gains
What advantage do you even have right now you wouldn't get as a level 4 individual on TD?

Long story short, I got kicked out out of the fucking house.  It's now been 6 hours outside in the cold, and I want to go back so my plan is to msg her the answer.  So my question...what fuk bears? jpow? purple eggplant? bulls?  Would be great to hear from actual bears because you guys get fuk regularly, even on weekends.  thanks.

That Tesla post isnt real so dont let it get to you
price was 230 at the time. He bought options with a strike at $680.
$1 premium for an 18-month option nearly 200% out of the money? that doesn't make sense. I haven't seen him post any proof that his purchases. His all time trading is photoshopped too cause it's missing parts
I used to be a casino addict. I’d go like 3-4 times a week and play a few grand each trip. It was bad. Playing stocks instead has saved me so much money. I’m still -EV, but waaaaay better than casino. And I win more frequently, so it’s more enjoyable.

If you sell 100 naked GME 25 calls (over 50% OTM right now) you could collect 5k next week. Or you can be paying for people's future homes.

I realized the macro change n trends towards EV bk in 2017. While doing my MPH I took an environmental of public health course that introduced me to green policies.  I believe from a policy point of view of the shift to EV is unstoppable.
I’m fairly new to this so maybe a stupid question but if someone owns that many shares, wouldn’t they want the price to go up? The only thing I can think is if they sold calls and don’t want them to hit strike price?

What op did is very rare. To buy long calls on generational stock like Tesla and to then hold as long as he has. It’s like going to a roulette table betting all on 0, hitting then putting it all on 0 again and again hitting. And finally put it all on 0 a third time
36 and feel like a teenager, and fuck better than one too.
26% in Germany but since I’m a student and get taxed lower than this 26% I might pay bit less.

Will update you once I know for sure. It’s retarded here.. usually the broker takes care and you don’t have to worry about it but because I’m on t212 and plus500 I have to do it on my own

Doesn't matter the boats are already guaranteed not to sail until March or April and it will only get worse as they try to get final certification when most people aren't even vaccinated yet. They could miss sailing for summer 2021 which would likely put them on the edge of bankruptcy as they'd have only \~6 months of cash after missing their best time of year again.
That's dumb as fuck how cheap they were.  If you wanted to try something like that right now, even 6 months out, the highest strike price calls you can buy are 5-10k

Yes, you can buy options up until 2023 on RH, check out the TSLA call option options for example. This dude bought last July, stock price would’ve been $250 ish, he bought a $500 strike for $1.10ish. Sounds about right. I could be wrong but hopefully u/Amino-mon can confirm?

Edit: OP if what I said was accurate, congrats dude, that’s absolutely life-changing.
RSI in a good spot, already shaved off 15-25% and positive upcoming catalysts, your charts don’t mean shit
I’m not saying XL Fleet is a bad company! I just don’t understand a 70% run up in a few weeks with 0 catalysts - everything about them has been public for a while, it makes no sense to go up that much in such a short period with nothing explicitly driving it.

Curious, don't you actually need $1M to actually exercise the option? Or would you just trade the options themselves?
Depends on company and valuation. Limited float might drive it up. Hard to say but I think after an announcement we could see 35-50 depending on the terms and the company. Worst case I think we hover around 25-30 on a sub par deal.
That's a very strange way of saying Tesla is up 600%
Your mom is dinosaur
Why would you want to go through somebody’s post history? You’re the loser.
Sorry if I sound dumb but how do you get "200,000% returns"? Tesla stock since ipoing has gone up like $1,192%, so how does that equate to 200,000%?
Yeah, well, I agree, fuck him sideways, upside down and from behind...
This would be so insane 😵

IV is 300%. Best of luck. Even if you're right, it's gonna need a pretty big move to profit.
Thanks bro. It’s really crazy how much exuberance there is right now in the market 😂
You don;t have to pay for historical prices, you can do it on TOS and I’ve checked it and it adds up. In June 2019 you could buy the Tesla 680c for around a buck. The split adjusts all the prices so that 1 x 680C at $1 turns into 5 x 136C @ 0.2

The split messes up the way the prices are displayed but it absolutely checks out. When he bought eh 680C, tesla was trading around $250 and the contract costed approx $1. The split then divided everything by 5 and gave him 5x the number of contracts.

Yup pretty sure it’s fake. Fidelity has price option history and the lowest price with a 130ish strike price was around 20.

Lol. No.

bit late to the post
wait, if I closed my positions but haven't withdrawn the money, it's not a taxable event?
Can someone explain how? I’m a total newb to this.
IVR chart looks pretty
Okay so looking at the 140c historical data, it was at its lowest around the time you bought. Post split, it’s showing a price of $70.95 per share at its lowest the week of 6/3/19. Pre-split that’s $14.19 per share? Just for reference current price on that strike is $453.85 so it’s very similar to yours. Unless TDA historical data is BS or my math is wrong, this is exaggerated.

Can someone break this down for me. What was the bet he made was it a long shot like bought 100 contracts for the long haul? Options trading confuses me
You guys realize if you bought just 40 Tesla shares on Jan 1 this year (so it's 200 shares after the split), it would be up 100k this year. Shares.
476k

I’m patiently waiting for GME to issue some shares and screw everyone.
With retards like OP taking positions it has to tank now
I was playing like 2-3 weeks outs on $25P cause its ridic its that high and last time it got here it ate fucking shit for months and they still are delaying sailings for months. I was long it most the year but this is fucking stupid.

I expected they'd sail for sure at least a little bit in 2020. Now that they might miss all sailing for the \*summer\* of 2021, they are not in a place where a surging valuation makes sense even with vaccine news providing temporary optimism.
Were these contracts even trading at the time? I’m guessing he had to bid for the contracts and wait for a buyer?

Those w/ CRM calls. Congrats on your easy $$$.
Bro .23x100 shares =$23 x 20 contracts $460
If it's real then good job OP but a lot of things don't add up. 

Just the extrinsic time alone should make the cost of the contract cost way more than $23. Just take a look at pretty much any stock that is a couple hundred and you'll find contracts 2 years out are usually a few hundred if not a few thousand because time is extremely expensive for options. 


Not the best comparison but 1/20/2023 NKLA 60 is $590 @ a price of $18.80 so 3x the current value, also an EV that lost 78% from its ATH, and is also a stock that everyone thinks will fail. It is also a $19 stock and even though strike prices are based on the stock value, it's going for 31x the stock value. Doesn't make for a stock a few hundred like TSLA to have a premium of $23 while a $19 stock has 31x. The more expensive the stock, the higher the premium cost and this is pretty much a fact.


Most of the time CBOE doesn't release strikes that are way higher than the current value and if it does the only time any contracts are that cheap is usually when they're about to expire and super far OTM. For LEAPS you're paying a premium for time so even super OTM costs a ton. For market makers, the price of the option is based on intrinsic (how far from the current stock price) value and extrinsic (time) value so even if the intrinsic value is nothing, there's still extrinsic value.


I wish I had access to historical prices (you have to pay for it) and then that would put all this to rest as we could see the prices but for now, OP's story seems dubious at best.
Can you imagine a fucking trade that turns a random autists 10k-50k into like hundreds of millions of dollars?

That Tesla post is gonna be the death of me. I know it.
NVDA? anyone?
Yeah at $17, not at $23.45
Honestly Idk, I just read more of OP's reply talking about the cost. I could be wrong, either way fuck this guy.

oh, so then it's RobinHood being retarded in a way it reports post-split gains?! O.o'
If your lifestyle would require a 4% annual yield of $250k+, then you are far outside the bell curve.
pre-split it was four calls for $1.15 each and TSLA was trading under $50/share just last year in 2019 (after adjusting)
Wise man
So 500k purchased would have turned into 1 billion.

GME - Share Lending FAQ

1.	⁠GTC limit orders don’t do shit to inhibit lendability. Your $420.69 limit sell means nothing. GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS.
2.	⁠Shares held in cash accounts can only be lent with your explicit permission (e.g. enrollment into a lending program like @ IBKR, Schwab, etc.). When this starts going berserk (already up to 17% as of Friday’s close from 7% Monday morning) they will reach out and offer you low at first, eventually ridiculous annualized interest rates to opt in. Look at the historical interest rates on iborrow during the proxy recall this Spring as a proof point. DON’T.
3.	⁠Shares held in a margin account can and will be lent, unless you are NOT using any margin and the position is fully cash secured. If any portion of the position is no longer secured, the broker will assuredly be lending your GME. Those prime broker fuckers are frothing at the mouth to lend all shares (even synthetic ones) that exist (and then some, thanks to synthetic longs—see S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky’s excellent writeup here that specifically discusses GME: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/ ). They’ve been doing it for years (see my Twitter (RodAlzmann) for some charting on the shares short vs. price vs. short interest on max and other charts) and will gladly keep making $$$ off your shares.

That is all. Godspeed, GameStop.

GME - Share Lending FAQ

1.	⁠GTC limit orders don’t do shit to inhibit lendability. Your $420.69 limit sell means nothing. GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS.
2.	⁠Shares held in cash accounts can only be lent with your explicit permission (e.g. enrollment into a lending program like @ IBKR, Schwab, etc.). When this starts going berserk (already up to 17% as of Friday’s close from 7% Monday morning) they will reach out and offer you low at first, eventually ridiculous annualized interest rates to opt in. Look at the historical interest rates on iborrow during the proxy recall this Spring as a proof point.
3.	⁠Shares held in a margin account can and will be lent, unless you are NOT using any margin and the position is fully cash secured. If any portion of the position is no longer secured, the broker will assuredly be lending your GME. Those prime broker fuckers are frothing at the mouth to lend all shares (even synthetic ones) that exist (and then some, thanks to synthetic longs—see S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky’s excellent writeup here that specifically discusses GME: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/ ). They’ve been doing it for years (see my Twitter (RodAlzmann) for some charting on the shares short vs. price vs. short interest on max and other charts) and will gladly keep making $$$ off your shares.

That is all. Godspeed, GameStop.

It's up 60%. Not 160%. Just 60%.

>It would make sense to sell if they expect the price to temporarily fall. You sell now and buy it back after the dust is settled doesn't matter if they believe in the long-term of the company or not.

So, is this your thesis? Because that's betting on them performing a behavior that aligns with your views.

>What does matter is: do you think a company where 70%+ of shareholders weren't allowed to sell their 160% gains are now allowed to sell 25% of their stock will make it fall?

Well, it's only 60%, and honestly I doubt that anyone who has any high number of shares has a reason to do this. They are well compensated with cash. I don't see where the cashflow promise is supposed to kick in.
Clown gang 🤡
In for long. Sucks to have it at the top though. Suppose plenty of time to average down

I’m not sure, at least thinking about the comparison between PLTR and GME. We have reliable historical data and trends for GME, while PLTR is new and everyone is trying to figure out who the comparable are, what growth might look like, what their reasonable addressable market is...etc. There are many more unknown aspects of PLTR which, I think make it more volatile in normal trading.

GME on the other hand is a binary bet (more or less). The company goes bankrupt and shorts win, the company is not bankrupt, and shares double. 

There’s probably some subjectivity around the fair value if it is not a bankruptcy risk, which is fair, but it’s not the same type of volatility we see with PLTR.
??? That's how options are labeled. If I sell you a put and get $0.25 premium, it gives me $25.00 cash premium. Are you saying I'd get $0.25 cents?

From a post five months ago:

> "I took hiatus from posting just because it was taking too much time. This has been a crazy ride. I closed out my most profitable core position today. I loaded up on 30 $690 strike CALLs last year in August/September with cost basis of $0.26. I did not sell anything until the first run up in Feb because I was buying and selling shorter expirations on the run up from October very profitably. I sold 9 of the $690 contracts for average of $340 when stock went parabolic in early Feb so was very cash heavy going into March. In March I held all positions and bought many 03/2021 and 01/2022 $1000 strike CALLs on the way down with proceeds from previous sale. The largest "mistake" I made was in early may when I sold 5 contracts for $75 hoping that it was cresting and I could exchange for 2021 calls for similar price. The stock kept going up so that didn't work out. Fortunately I used those proceed on Elon's overvalued Tweet day so probably will be no net loss. As the remaining core calls expire next Friday I have sold on the run up with the last 9 selling from $325 today. When averaged across all sales I sold for average of $270 and currently hold about 70% of proceeds in cash/index funds, mostly for taxes, and carry 23 contracts that are in the money going forward. This is a staggering 100,000%+ gain on an intial investment of $760 just in proceeds from initial purchase and as I hold the 2021/2022 expiring contracts (currently up about 900% from March) that could triple or quadruple. People are commenting on options today. This type of trade will never happen with TSLA again but it is quite remarkable how options can be used profitably."

Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo.

That- that's about it.
RCL dilution on Friday so good timing for you. I had some NCLH puts late last week but closed them up with a small gain cause it was pushing hard into the $26s on the news of cancelling January and February cruises...

Can't hold up much longer though. We all know it'll see $19 or below again.
yeah have you been looking at reproduction numbers for millennials?
Got out. Water was evaporating.
This sounds pretty cool actually.
That's not how math works retard, 200,000% of $92 would be $184,000. 5:1 split doesn't just magically 5x your investment lol ffs.
I still need to do some small minded research. I will never buy something based off of just advice on WSB, I did that in February with ALLY and still think about my stupidity.
This isn’t DD. It doesn’t show you’ve done any research or put any work into your recommendation, which is probably why the post was removed. Better luck next time
Should be in the main feed; scroll down a few days - is a screenshot of his balance and he tells the story
First thanks for the data and helping me look into this. I get what you are trying to say as in you are saying the 136 strikes are worth 463.35 as of yesterday. But that matches up with his screenshot since 20 x 100 x 463.35 is roughly 926,700 which is his equity right now. I'm not understanding what you mean by this 92.44 number. 

If you want to readjust it back to 2019 levels, you need to take 463.35 and times 5 (not divide). Then you take that answer and multiple it by 4 times 100 (since he'll only have 4 options pre split)
[deleted]
You don't buy stocks, you buy contracts that allow you to buy stocks.  

1 contract gives you control over 100 shares.  

This guy bought contracts that expire in 2021 that allow him to buy 100 shares of tesla for the price of about $115 or so from what I can tell.  Tesla's stock has since mooned.  

He bought 20 contracts basically. 23 cents each. Those contracts are now worth $423 each.  

Total cost  = .23 x 20 x 100 = about $500

Contracts value atm = $423 x 20 x 100 = almost $1 million.   $500->~$1 million.  


Most people don't use options to buy actual shares of stock.  They cash in the contracts' values.
Tell me again what happened when people went apeshit and bought far OTM PLTR calls
Out of interest (roughly) how old are you?
Buy and sell a contract at two different prices. Buy a leap at $20 and sell at $25. Caps your gains tho.
Exercise some of those.
Are you serious

What is your position?
Move somewhere with low regulations where no one else wants to live. You can trade from anywhere.
This is what he actually bought, check the historical option price for this contract in summer 2019 and it’s absolutely possible.

4 x 15 Jan 21 680C @ 1.15

When the split happened he ended up with

20 x 15 Jan 21 136C @ 0.23

Check the option chart, those contracts went as low as 0.39 in June 2019. It’s absolutely possible.
Fuck off
Who's man is this? Lmaooo.
Even if it has a good week, PLTR ain't going above $30 this week. The meme strength is gone, just accept it
Monday around like 9-930  pltr will move outside of the current wedge. If it breaks above that resistance line , the levels of support for an up trend are prices: 28, 32, ATH. (Each one of those levels needs support to go to the next level)  However, if it breaks downward from the wedge, the level of support prices are : 22,  18, and the absolute worst case scenario (if the bears have a hay day with our heinies ) the bottom of the barrel support level for pltr is 14. It could go either way. It needs support to go on the uptrend. IlGl everyone who's playing this !

>I said cloth masks don’t work as I stated before. 

Again, an ignorant opinion that encourages people to be at risk during the middle of a goddamned pandemic. So, so stupid to say this shit. 
Listen bud, if you've got research that demonstrates it with covid pts, I welcome you to bring it and prove me wrong. Or, you can check the CDC, who have gotten their shit partially together since the Springtime and recommend them as a measure to prevent against covid. 

And its true that some masks are better than others, which is *very* different from "cloth masks don't work." Theres a reason I wear an N95 at work and cloth masks in public, and it has the most to do with scarcity of resources. 

Your third* sentence stands in opposition to your first sentence. 

Masks work. cover your face. Jesus. Its not rocket science to understand that a person in a cloth mask who sneezes in your face, will get less shit onto your face, compared to a non cloth masked person sneezing. Not hard to imagine.
He doesn’t want poors to buy and get rich. Riches won’t work in his sweat shops
Not only no, but FUCK NO. I was 40% cash going into this crap and have done very well when everyone else sold off out of fear. This was such an easy call. People were comparing it to legit recessions and depressions. This one was forced when abruptly idiot governors and the President shut everything down. The fundamentals were always strong. I bought every week from April 1-June. Anyone not a retard knew this was all coming back just as soon as businesses were allowed to open again

This isn't an original investment of $500, it's an original investment of  $92. the 5:1 split turned this into 20 contracts.

So it would be $92 into almost $1MM.

OP, thanks for posting and the comments
look at the charts for ipos. historically there's an insane rise then plummets for potentially years. If your exit plan is good and you can afford to lose 20k, then yeah, by all means.

Can someone help me understand this? Options are so confusing. he paid 463 for an option, idk if it's call or put. Can he file that as it is right now and cash out even though the expiration date isn't till the 15th?

Oh.. you throw out the crazy card to intimidate people to shut the fuck up.  guess what you punk ass bitch, i dont give a rats ass as to what you and your small dick have to say bc if you read the things you write you are full of insecurities about your ability to gamble in this market.  perhaps you should actually do your DD and read instead of following along.  you think cussing at someone is going to save your position?  if you buy based on what someone says without doing your DD you get played.  speculating means looking at companies from different angles and seeing how well they are positioned agsinst each other and you get to see all sorts of shit like your companies weakness.

Never bet against lord Elon 
Never 🏳️‍🌈🐻
You sure? I’m willing to work this out. 

If he paid 0.23 (regardless of split), it makes this a $136 strike. Break even is the underlying price plus the contract price. 

The current price for this is correct as of yesterday (or very close to) at $463.35 per contract.

When the split happens, say you have 1 x 2000C call, you get 5 x 400C calls, and the contract price also divides by 5. 

So the expiration is the same. The ACTUAL contract he bought was a (pre-split) Jan 21 680c, he got 4 of them (20/4) and the CONTRACT PRICE was also 0.23 x 5 = 1.15.

If you look at the historical option pricing for the Jan 21 680c, those contracts were actually around this price in July 2019 when he said he bought them.

So what happens when the stock split, is that you get 5 times as many contracts, with a strike price divided by 5 and the contract value divided by 5. To see the real value of the contract however, you need to use the PRE SPLIT contract price.

Mathematically this makes sense, however unlikely.

Nice play. Why did you decide on Nordstrom?
Haha oh...
It’s taxed as income so depends on your bracket. And don’t forget, it’s taxed at different rates depending on your total income.
Some time before or slightly after "who want to be a millionaire"
It will jump when DA is announced.
That's exactly how companies are valued. Take all the shares outstanding and multiple by price per share. 

And you buy or sell off of literally today's value ($600 billion) based on what you think it will be in the future. 

So complete morons buy today thinking the stock price (aka the total value of the company, aka the $600 billion) will be much higher, 100s of billions or trillions higher in the future. 

In the year 2020 google will profit $40 billion. They are VALUED at about 2x Tesla. And Tesla has never even had a profitable year. Maybe a year or 2 away from getting to $1 billion net profit in a year. 

Companies that lose money or barely make a few hundred million in a quarter are not worth 3/4s of a trillion dollars. Sorry to hurt your feelings.

Want to buy GME leaps but I’m worried about IV crush  and I don’t want to buy shares. How can I hedge my calls?
All in on GME
By “added risk of the larger premiums” i just mean that LEAPs cost more (because you’re paying for more time value/theta) and your max loss is defined by the up front cost of your options, so you’re taking on some more risk with the higher capital investment required for this type of play.
What i mean is the 136 strike closed yesterday at that price, meaning it is equal to what the 680 was in 2019
loonies?
I think it’ll go down more, but if you’re buying leaps to hold it’ll most likely be an inconsequential amount in the long run. You’re never going to time your entry perfectly. Just get in and try to forget about them for a while.
Love the gains though, I'm trying to understand all of it.

Im exaggerating but it is stupid to me how people act like holding stocks has zero risk simply because the market has always gone up over time.  If you’re counting on the market to always go up then you’re doing the same thing as the people who are buying calls.
Hey dumbass. Tesla was $380 pre split in august 2018. Which opened up contracts for $600. It dropped all the way to $180 and those contracts don’t just disappear. You’re still able to buy once they open to the market.
Don't worry, after the next mortgage, he won't own the house, the bank will.
No he didn't have the 136 strike. He must've had the 680. He has the 136 strike now because the stock split caused all options to do a 5:1 split earlier this year. So only the 680 is relevant when looking at historical data.

On June 3 2019, again the lowest day of the year for tsla, the ask on the 680 strike was 1.76 with a bid of 0. It is possible, I suppose, that he picked them up for 1.15. But the 136 strike closed with a price of 463.35. So did he gain 92.44 (463.35÷5 = 92.67 - .23 = 92.44)? 20 contracts is $1.8 mil
Nio+Snap moons=big monies for me

What’s amazing is I was there on RH looking at this summer of 2019 calls and shares of TSLA. I bought a couple and sold. Later after selling it goes on its historic run. And I end up playing the puts game during the crash only for it to rise as fast as it crashed.... in the end I’m down 40k looking like a goober and OP is a patient genius. Congrats OP— amazing.
Found the AAPL Bull
I've held shares since Nov 2019 because I was wanting to take a long position on crispr being approved for wider use. Genome editing has been getting a lot more press and the pipeline for CRISPR Therapeutics looked solid. The success of the sickle cell tests also didn't have nearly enough impact on price, so it seemed very undervalued. I got quite lucky on the timing of the jump, but now that it's getting more notice, I'm expecting it to keep jumping.
Oh yeah by going up 30 cents!
RH has earnings this week. Yes that one company that will cause Robinhood to call themselves HOOD rather than RH when they go public.

it'd be cool if i could look up if that option existed or not cause that would put the whole thing to bed, but without being able to do that i can't say definitively that it didn't exist. seems like it wouldn't cause the strike would have been insanely OTM but who knows.

The only thing I've got heavy rn, besides JKS, is OSTK.  I think OSTK is mispriced. I currently have 300 shares @$56.59, it's currently at $62.72. Should be $100 stock from what I've read from analyst's. Earnings should be pretty good due to covid, on 1/28 premarket. Once I'm out of JKS, putting that into OSTK. Not sure what else is mispriced rn tho.
what platform are you using for options?
Hey guys
What was your reasoning for buying those specific calls at that time? Was it a down week for the stock so you just went long?

Thanks my g 🙏⛳
Smart play man! Congrats on the gains. Let us know your next play
maybe im just retarded with my greek but were 25c's (at $4/share) really a good idea when the 20cs were only a bit more expensive ($5/share) and so on for anything a bit less OTM?

this is jeopardy!
I closed all my CCL calls yesterday (bought when stock was at $8 and then more at $14).  The problem is they are desperate for money so if price go up too much, there is a good chance they will just keep on issuing more shares.  Making money owning calls with stock going from $25-30 is going to be a lot harder than say $15-20.

Their competition is being wiped out and the company itself is no longer under scrutiny from legislators.
Google has tsla at 30-50 durning summer of 19.  Or $150 ish pre split. So wouldn’t this be a contract for 680 strike ? How is that possible, the most liquid stocks don’t have 500% OTM strikes ?
We are!
You can look back on costs - there *were* enough of these sold at low enough prices to make this real last summer, hard to believe.

What a simplistic, ignorant opinion.

You're pro small business. Great. Wanna know what would have kept small businesses open? If everyone wore a goddamned mask, socially distanced, and used hand sanitizer. 

Instead we have people like you, saying shit that keeps small businesses closed, because people keep getting covid, because they hear that masks dont prevent covid. 

Wanna know what I've been wearing at work since February, while I've been face to face with covid+ people in the ICU? 

Spoiler: Its what you can start wearing to keep small businesses open.

No you can’t find a cheap leap (oxymoron) 3-4x OTM on RH (don’t exist). On a $200 highly volatile stock. It’s almost like they don’t exist. Wouldn’t be buying a LEAP at a time of extreme greed like this either. Get in, make your money, get out.

It’s unlikely that RobinHood even controls the kerning at per-character granularity. 

This is most likely just a standard text field rendered by the iOS or Android UI libraries. And either those libraries produce slight kerning variations between characters for some reason, or they don’t.

One of the best trades in human history, to be honest.
Investing and trading and degenerate gambling is not the same. In this sub we do the latter. Run.
Even if the losses are spread out, at the end of the day, options are zero sum games. One investor's profit is always built on another one or more investors' losses.

He bought 4 options. TSLA stock split 5 for 1. When that happens the strike is divided by 5 and you get 5 options for each 1 you hold to keep the ratios intact
Nice job!  Meme stocks are a great way to grow your funds as long as you recognize that they are meme stocks and that you should dump them once they look like they're topping out to take profit and move it into the next one.  Don't be a bag holder and don't join <insert-meme-stock-here>-gang!
Exactly, I really did try to turn the sub, but nobody was listening
pull it all out and reinvest it into more TSLA calls pussy.

Ah gotcha. Google News is actually a good source of info if you can sift through the Cirton reports. If you’re a long Amazon you should look into the news of Amazon Pharmacy that they just announced.
Bigger they are the harder they fall
Not gone up much since IPO? It is up 60% since September.

It would make sense to sell if they expect the price to temporarily fall. You sell now and buy it back after the dust is settled doesn't matter if they believe in the long-term of the company or not. What does matter is: do you think a company where 70%+ of shareholders weren't allowed to sell their 60% gains are now allowed to sell 25% of their stock will make it fall?
Sorry, I’m at the gym. Can’t think clearly..meant vaccine news
okay on monday ill write a call on intc 3x spot price

I'll buy some of their shares up if they paper hand us to under 15. Like a fool I only dropped 1% of my portfolio into GME at 13.75. I'd like to atleast double down.

Poor earnings are priced in.
Im new to this. Was he not investing?
It would actually be smarter (wait no, not smarter ... more effective? More effective.) if we all bought calls. 

If we all put the same amount of money into long-dated calls, it would prompt the large money managers to hedge by purchasing shares. The net result would be a purchase of far, far more shares than even what WSB has managed collectively.
I think stop losses are going to get hit big time on Monday - big money wants this at an even cheaper price as they accumulate

You are also forgetting theta, each day that goes by, your premium pulls towards zero. And with the way we retards are trading, we are buying when they are most volatile.

Well honestly one always has to go in the markets with the idea that there isn’t many good ideas out there to begin with. This allows you to be very selective with what ideas you entertain. With that being said, the risk reward ratio isn’t that high anymore since the markets are stabilizing. This really was a black swan event, which made it even more subject to mispricing that any other crash in history. Always have to ask yourself, what is currently being mis priced? In my opinion PCG and all utilities are, since people are looking for bigger returns. I wouldn’t play options with utilities you might die of boredom, but im buying a ton of PCG shares right now. Part of my success was that I tried to stay away from options unless I really saw the idea and wanted to go for the jugular. Capital preservation is key.

That's why I just did a few very small very cheap options at first so even if they didn't go anywhere I could figure out how things work and not need to worry about losing everything I plan to actually use for investment.

I felt like I was still confused after watching videos and reading about it, so hands on learning helps fill in a lot of the gaps.
I still think they are by far in the worst shape among airlines. If you are truly bearish you should be buying like 6 month out downside puts.

New thread for DEC 5?🆘🤔
The fact that you haven’t sold... how do you sleep? How heavy are your balls? Do they get in the way when you walk ?
3300 is too far otm. probably grab a 3150 and sell at 3200/3230. Youre looking for 4-5% over this month. Judging by last year, it is possible, but that would only get you to break even.

Additionally, it seems that AMZN is lagging NQ hard, where TSLA and semiconductors are the leaders right now.

More vaccine negative news helps, but stimmy isnt looking too good either.
I want a large SELL ALL button just for kicks.

- deal with Roku
- opening up HboMax worldwide next year
2. Spin off of DirecTV - should clear 20 bn to use other ways, inc paying down debt.

I love 3/18 too. Buyback should hit by then, big financial partner will be announced (which the market hasn’t priced it) and it covers their next earnings. Don’t buy calls until it dips below $19. Maybe even low $18s. Call holders have been getting fucked for 3 months in a row.

Which still may happen
I don't have the data to check right away but basically if you want the pre-split prices, his post is implying a 1/15/21 680 strike that was sold for 1.15 (again all before the 5:1 split). If that does exist, then it can definitely be real. I asked this other guy who has the data. u/heavy_scrotum.

Thats the current price of the contract you retard. Tesla stock price is underneath
Bc you bought them like 1 month out you ape
Any of the Fusion startups, actually.
I hope the next 4 years aren't always going to be a theta bleed. Feels like that's been the case lately where shares, theta > OTM options.
Is this what they call an emerging market? Balls deep calls🚀🚀🚀
Great job and fuck you. Keep it up!
On gods earth do you fuck away 300k

My brain almost exploded by reading this. I’m too retarded. So yes or no? Fake ?
Are you my dad?
Guy in here last week made 9.5m on TSLA calls and moved to Puerto Rico - straight savage
How many got to the bottom by owning stonks?
Covered calls all day. You shouldn't be sweating at all.
EUA approval for Pfizer and Moderna will come shortly after FDA meeting on 12/10.  So big news can come Friday at the earliest.
Theres is 1 million retards here at there is literally only 1 guy who won the call lottery like that recently, I wouldnt read too much into it. Its probably real though, but who cares?
It’s up over 300% YTD though
Rolling contracts is selling your current contracts and buying further dated contracts all in one order. Doesn’t necessarily have to be for a loss or the same price.
Futures have been hella fake for months
How do you only have 15m after this much insider trading?  More money has been made on this sub with memes and zero insider knowledge.
People are making end of the year tax moves
This may be inverse WSB territory. Especially when everyone turns on a meme atock because they get bored that's your chance.

I'm not betting the house but I put a decent sized play in.
There's a post here explaining it might be tax related with "hearbeat" trades.
It says current price is $463. Are you still long as the current current price is $598.98?
Wow sometimes I think about tesla and wonder how much money I could’ve made if I just bought tesla cals back in March lmao
I don’t understand how this works :(
I’m either too retarded or not retarded enough
I'm 30% sure this is Michael Reeves just based on the smarts needed to do something this retarded
you can, but whatever helps you sleep at night.
Would be pretty easy for him to show the trade confirmation when he bought the original contracts for 0.23. I dont believe you can buy leaps on anything that far out for 0.23. Nor would tesla EVER have leaps that far OTM at that stage. The numbers are more damning but i really don’t care to try and disprove it. Your argument was fair but for me it doesnt prove anything than the fact that Robinhood need better designers. This is also evidenced by their use of digital confetti and smiley faces when you make a trade.
What sucks is the nature of wsb is that only the high iv "stonks" that have already gone through a massive run up are the ones that get high visibility.
NKLA?
So youre saying NKE calls and BA calls (airforce) or DFEN calls.
Fuck it im buying all 3.

Im in VBIV 7.5c 1/15/2021

Covid is bullish, stimmy is bullish, ATHs is how it should be with fed policy layout and money printing. You sound pretty gay mate
Best WSB trade of all time.
Great awesome fucking work. Tell me all that u ate and drank on the day of purchase, I plan to replicate this.
Why has $HYLN gone to shit the past two months they seem like a legit EV maker
Holy fuck. Just turned on “the 2nd” on Netflix it’s fucking unwatchable. What is this garbage? But Samaire Armstrong looks fucking hot.

I’m once again asking for your financial support.
AQB is on the move
imagine having a 4922% return. now imagine youre this guy's rounding error
It already rallied in the past week
I bought 69 shares @ 15$, so someone is gonna get fucked
P.s I stopped wearing condoms about 7 years ago. 

Thanks for the reply btw.
I’m thinking.
ER was pretty solid, it dipped 20? Percent after it and have established a stable base. Getting ready to jump? COVID isn’t going anywhere and from my perspective that’s good for wix. I’m having 15 260C 12/18.
i have a somewhat similar assessment but bought a 1/2022 leap instead of shares
lol, I wouldn't, you'll likely get burned. They are overvalued af, but they have a very strong balance sheet with no debt.
They could give the vaccine to Africa instead.
Shares are much different. Options are lucrative because they represent 100 shares. So he essentially borrowed 20x 100 shares saying that it will hit $680 by January for a price of $500. This was entirely unlikely so it was cheap. These shares increased in value so much since then and that’s where these gains come from.
He is still hungry I am sure
this isn't true, but if it helps you sleep at night cool
prpl
Did you shit yourself in March?
Congrats OP. I think with 5mil I’d have enough to take care of my family & disappear.
If they want to remain neutral sure, but we know that institutions want to be mega short on this. So why would they bother hedging? By hedging they would be undoing the position they've taken.

To be fair I wouldn't doubt some are hedging but probably not to the extent they would normally
Since you have the data, check to see if the 680 strike was ever 1.15. That's what the conversion is. See my post history for my last post if you want to see why you can make that conversion from his current screenshot.
Damn Son!! RIOT got ROCKED AH.... DOWNGRADE.
Please tell me you’ve been having a hot hand when it comes to picking winners lately
Heartbeat trade?

People have done more for Internet karma.

Don't forget we're talking about WSB autists - you gotta know your audience.

But your point remains valid - I honestly don't know if it's real or fake.
They're not going to run until after January 5th.
I never said I don’t wear one I said cloth ones don’t stop it.  Also imagine closing down the whole country so all small business close down and they go broke while all these big ass company’s stay open and gain billions. Biggest wealth transfer in history. All for something that you have a higher than 99 percent chance of living from in most cases. Shit isn’t going away closing everything down does more harm than good
yea not anticipating one of those every year but spotting the next one is going to be easier now that tsla has set the path
He called us retards,  the bloody autist called us retards.
Do it just be safe
Can't win the game if you don't take the risk.
Dude seriously. The amount of steel nerve to hold through all the wild swings is insane. I would have caved like a bitch ages ago.

Is RKT the most disappointing meme stock of 2020?
I'm happy for you, but mad at myself. I'm a throw up right now.

I'll get over this feeling in an hour.
It’s highly likely
#GOLDMANSACHS
Not DD you fucking retard
I'll post this here from the weekend thread. 

I actually looked at the details for the Tesla guy and it's actually easy to check. He said the options are 0.23 now and the breakeven is 136.23 (all split adjusted) in the screenshot. 

This means prior to the split, it must've been the Jan 2021 680 strike calls (136x5). Just check if those ever traded for 0.23x5 = 1.15 near the Tesla 2019 summer lows. Hope you guys understood how I got these numbers I calculated above. 

I think it's possible. I know that like 200 (split adjusted) shares of Tesla from Jan this year is roughly 100k, so if he's holding 20 ITM calls from summer 2019 (which is similar to a bit less than 2000 shares in delta), that can be approximately 1 milion.
They are but they are also way more fishy
Tell me about it. I bought TSLA and SHOP calls for Jan 2022 right around the bottom. Then sold them for +50% bc I was so sure we would get a second covid wave and an even deeper drop
username doesn't check out

that's like $200,000 for the lazy
What does 4 pre split options mean? I'm new to this.
Why? Senate will most likely vote against the bill.
Fake and gay

All that time premium for $1???
Wow
I've worked 40 days during the pandemic because the government forced things to close up, so no, i don't feel bad for doubling my portfolio.

if you aint shilling PLTR, you aint black
Wait for me. I'm joining you in 12 days. 50K moving into RKT.
Still the e commerce leader!
so basically you've only been trading for the last few months?

you can literally see the historic prices

You can also just buy FB OTM leaps right now and if the stock goes up 100-200% you make 4000-20000%
What's your basis?
Cost basis?
Buying calls
This sounds like a PSA
I made my money on the way down. Fuck brick and mortar stores.
I hope nobody take this seriously so my vxx calls can print instead of slowly dying as my insurance for long positions.
Sure, murder a bunch of people because you don't like their politics.  Sounds reasonable.
Theres a guy on my local craigslist paying $100 to someone who has covid to come infect him. He must really hate his job or something.
I'm just passing through from all, so I have no idea what any of this means. Sounds like OP did good based on the comments and awards though.
All I’ll say is I wanted to get in ASAP and bought at 18.3 if I waited a few hours it would have been 16.3.
can i be one for you? 

in honesty though that sounds like a waste of money. you should just buy prostitutes instead.
I am staying out I guess and wait 1-2 weeks. Unless it trades close to IPO price but I doubt that. I have no crystal ball, maybe it does well on its first day after you do buy in, maybe it doesnt. It will probably trade at some way too retarded price above IPO anyway.

Last over hyped IPO was SNOW and although you wouldnt be in the red if you bought at first day now, you would have been big time 1-3 weeks after IPO.
Doesn't matter if it has long-term gains, you are better off selling short term and buying back later. I believe this company has strong potential long-term.

Consider the following, their gross revenue was 1.2% of fucking Tesla's in Q3 and their stock is 64% of its value. I don't care how much you think it is the future, it is possibly the most overvalued stock on the entire market. Tesla's P/E ratio of 1186 means nothing compared to this.
Touché - but by the same logic I can't really believe one vague screenshot is proof he actually made 200,000% in a few months. People have done far more for less karma
Will calls on Thor take you to Valhalla? Idk wtf they even do, but I think we've got a new meme stock boys 🚀🚀🚀. Go all in n hold thru earnings. Literally can't go tits up.

The commercial/merchant banks can beat Stripe's pricing. Stripe's big advantage is tech. Stripe is easier to deploy and highly integrated with popular platforms. Stripe is fast and sticky. They can capture a premium at scale.



With a typical merchant bank you are vetted and approved for an initial processing volume, they check your credit, and they might want to meet you. With Stripe, you can start accepting payments virtually instantly and they don't even pull your credit. Then take that further, a platform like Shopify can add new merchants to Stripe instantly with the API.

I actually had it during a trip to Thailand before it was even a thing in the US and my respiratory was problematic for a bit, but it's back to normal now.

I think i know which is more LIKELY. The numbers don’t add for sure, perhaps someone could check that, but the photoshop proof doesnt cut it for me.

10 GME 12/11 19c
8 NVDA 12/11 347.5c

The GME's are gonna make me more than the NVDAs and at like 10% of the margin requirement. Gotta love that 230% IV

Takes massive balls of steel to hold that long, brother. Well done
Honestly, we might be looking at the most profitable trade of all time.
my god read the replies to this post. yes it was faked. someone analyzed it in photoshop and it was determined it was fake. .25 calls didn’t exist back then anyways apparently
This post is questionable. Sad to see so many people assuming its legit without checking into it
Ya. Thanks for the advice. I’m willing to spend more money to at least get back the money I lost.

Probably sounds naive but I don’t want to wait that long haha

Omg can you imagine the lulz
It's so obvious it's fake when they sit there and say "Yeah still holding haha up 200,000% btw broke to millionaire in 2 months btw but yeah still holding"
Kids, watch this guy. In the Ancient time, they use to refer to people like him as a god. We call them retards, something beyond divinity
Truthfully, I only intend to make a case it *could* be fake, it's hard to really say one kerning error is proof this never happened. But the guy didn't give us much evidence either, I want to see the info on his actual calls. 

I'll be happy to applaud his achievement if he provides sufficient proof or more detailed screenshots, but this alone ain't gonna do it for me. I'm a skeptic
I see what you did there.
You just have to answer a few questions.
short term, profit taking can bring it down.  Long term when there are 10-30 other approved vaccines on the market, competition will lower their profit margin.  Their only advantage right now is being first/second mover but it will be a different story in 6-12 months.
Congratulations and fuck you
No shouldve went SPY 500c 2023 gang!
The last gain is all from CRSP. 12/18 140c. Since those are expiring soon, I'm going to buy longer calls. My other positions are NYMT and MITT 2022 calls because I'm a REITs sucker.
Hopefully, I have a 12/11 call
This is awesome hahahahaha
he claims 1.5 years (bought summer 2019, expy jan 15 2021), but yeah, im skeptical
What really kills me is that it wasn't even a risky bet.

When I see someone profiting bigly on their $50k yolo, I'm thinking "good for that guy, but I would never have yoloed this much anyway."

But 500 bucks to a million???  Fuck.

Sheeesh, 40k. It could easily drop by $20 due to some catalyst and 2020 is the year of catalysts. This is why I'm hesitant to go theta gang.

If everyone wore fucking masks our economy would be more open. It's that simple. But instead we have to issue hundreds of billions of more dollars in stimulus money because fucking idiots like you refuse to wear masks thanks to their pseudoscience they're getting from OAN and Fox News.

Option trading?
The borrowing fees to short are expensive. If your broker offers it and you don’t think the cost will eat into profits too much, then go for it. The challenge is trying to “guess” when the S-1 becomes valid following a merger because you cannot exercise the warrants until then. You don’t want to be stuck paying a 20% (annualized) borrowing fee for months waiting to be able to exercise the warrants.
How; can you share your wisdom
That’s the plan. I probably won’t truly make a position until I actually can at least secure a mid 2023 strike, since 2023 looks to be their ‘big’ year for entering the market. Then I’ll wait for an inevitable dip, load up, and go full boomer selling PMCC’s off of them for the foreseeable future.

Someone would do that? Just go and lie on the internet?
It’s so fascinating, you can tell from trend, most of those safe states were the hot spot in mid Nov which explains why there are no thanksgiving spike in those states because people probably stayed at home. Most importantly most the states that have surging case right now has surpassed previous ATH including March war zone states like NY, NJ. Next week will probably show a downward trend in death toll because middle west state has passed death peak and new surges hasn’t inflicted increase in death yet.

Lets see.. if its true he says dont buy to keep price down so it cost Elon less to purchase.

During that interview Elon stressed that the most important thing for Tesla is pumping product.  Arrival put out an article in october saying that tesla is doing it all wrong.  to get product out you need lots of microfactories which arrival is the best at.  and go fuck yourself you piece of shit.  you dont learn anything by not examining the whales positioning themselves and why some analyst are bought to say the opposite.
While the effort you have put in is admirable, consider this counterpoint. Robinhood is a brokerage that has no customer service, screws its users by front running their trades to Citadel and regularly has data breaches that cost users thousands of dollars. It fires digital confetti when you make a trade. Now, am I supposed to believe that this corrupt, ineffective VIDEO GAME brokerage, is really going to make sure that their UI graphics are lined up perfectly to the damn pixel?

Absolutely not. An easier way to disprove this would be to do the calculation of % and profit. But I’m not going to do it.
Yeah, I thought GME was the play. I almost dumped a lot into it, but I stopped myself after thinking the same way you are. Just spend a little bit. Worst case scenario you don’t lose much. Best case scenario, a wins a win.
How do you know? Or are you just salty
You can't just say it.  You have to declare it.
You gonna see less zero next week. That’s for sure

Nice. Funny thing is they could have been bought as late as early November.
You are not alone, brother 👊
anyone buying SE calls?
I thought it was a pure short squeeze play too but looked up it's cash position, product profit share and market incentive for companies to work with them, as well as their maneuvering to pivot online. 

It's not as stupid as it looks.
you know wsb is full of retards when the bandwagon comes in on that tsla post and says "options cant be priced that low look at OTM tsla calls right now"
Could be AMD/NIO
i fell for it too. some hyper autist counted the pixels on the numbers and found out it was faked lol
I have like 100k LT gains, should I move to TX for a couple months next year to sell?
>  If TSLA falls they will lose value, and a buyer would lose money even if TSLA stays where it is.

No idea what this means... Yes if tsla falls it was fall but its so far in the money it would fall about the same as stock.
Nah, the SPACs always moving. I don’t see the IV getting lower than 90ish
[deleted]
I agree with this assessment. I knew this had to be fake because TSLA doesn’t have this cheap of a contract on LEAPs. If this was bought in summer 19 as claimed, the price don’t seem right.

They could also not double.  You really think some so called journalist knows anything more than you or me?

I just tell them I'm an autist and they never ask me again
Chances of NIO getting back up to $46 next week ?
Yeah my only two real stock regrets (started investing in Dec 2018) are GME and TSLA. 

I hold some contempt for not buying WEED.TO at 12$ but i can handle it due to my other cannabis positions being all green currently.

I wear a mask because I assume that:

1) everyone has covid

2) if I were to get covid, it would really fuck me up

Downside of wearing a mask:

\- looks dumb

\- a bit more difficult to communicate

\- you have to remember to wear it whenever you go out in public

&#x200B;

Upsides of wearing a mask:

\- less likely to get fucked up by covid

\- if I'm asymptomatic, I'm less likely to give others covid

&#x200B;

It's not rocket science people

Makes sense. But from that logic it would affect each s&p500 stock. 
Even though amazon has the huge stake, all stakes are related to market cap, so it should affect each stock price the same.

Am I wrong?
Sell u coward

just do both

Yes.

*taps head*
Should go back into baba and predict the week it’s going to power rally back to 300’s
But the strike prices also split
Lmao poor hyln bag holders
idk, if you look at how TSLA was trading back when he bought there was relatively little price movement, almost non existent in the context of the moon mission it's been on since just after the time he claimed he bought. IV would have been extremely low, so if that strike was available, it was an absolute lotto for cheapies and he got lucky. others say it's a bad photoshop. doesn't matter, either way we all end up givin bj's behind wendy's in the end

Just fucking cash out, you don't need to hit that $1mm. You can easily get there with safe shit like SPY. You're literally one meth hit tweet from musk to losing half your gainz.

Only if they weren't appropriately hedged/covered on the calls.  Odds are it was a market maker that bought shares to cover their calls and they're already making millions on all the other options they sell.
Give it to him. More people the better
That will never happen again.  Options prices are forever changed because of him
$COST calls for earnings is a no brainer
World wide white collar crime...huge untapped market. Money laundering etc...
How
Kinda thinkin people will realize this and sell at $400 back to $300 ish to protect gains going into the lockup. If it stays at $400 a couple weeks ill add more jan puts then

ANAL is a good play but do your DD, and don’t do it for too long.
Lol yeeeup. I got into it in late April and quadrupled my money by early June then slowly bled out. Grab a hundred shares apiece of some stable shit, play theta with that and then gamble with your spare change
Not really. You need it to continue to trend toward the breakeven at your purchase in order for it to maintain value without dying to theta. Between now and then there will be plenty of volatility, but if the ask is "Will this be a reasonable gamble on the upward movement of this security going into a literal once in a lifetime forced buy?" I would say yes, 3% plus all potential upside is where i'd want to be.

I appreciate your reply. Sadly, I am going to have to Google most of it. Clearly, you used words, yet here I am, confused. I bought some shares in tesla, while mine has grown, nothing like OP.
States that we are clearly seeing a dip in covid cases right now: Tennessee, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Louisiana, Iowa, Washington, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Hawaii.    I checked all graphs myself and you can almost tell which states fuked up during thanksgiving because the trend is so obvious. Southern states will probably be the next hot spot as middle west states showing downward trends. 

I was going to post the ones that have big spikes after thanksgiving, but they are so many of them and I’m too lazy. So I decided to post the safe states cuz there are less of them.

So happy to see this.
The best meme stock of 2020 was TSLA. WHAT WILL IT BE FOR 2021? honestly could be snow.  Wouldn’t be surprised to see snow over 1k eoy 2021

Not gonna lie, if there was 2024 or 2025 LEAPS available I’d load up on GM so hard right now. These meme EV companies are going to face a harsh awakening when the boomer vehicle companies start seriously entering the electric vehicle market. Brand loyalty is a serious thing

This is like whack-a-mole strategy. Waiting for these frozen assets to make a move up and hoping you can smack them all when they pop.
How are my $25 lazr dec 18 calls gonna do
Sure, but a spread will lose value slower then a straight options purchase as well. IV is larger the farther OTM you are. So if he was betting the entire account, and he realized it was a mistake after a couple days, he could exit with a lot less loss.

Also, that isn't what naked means when dealing with options.  Naked has to do with if you're selling a call and you don't have the shares to back up the call you've written. if you have the shares then when they exercise the call the shares are automatically transferred to their account, otherwise you have to buy them at market rate to cover the exercise. You can also cover them with a spread, but he didn't write calls, he just bought em, so he wasn't naked on anything
This is fake. Don’t get your hopes up based on a loe
Care to show me your FB gains? Or any other IPO?
Yikes. Why pay for these scams, when you can join WSB for free. The only thing you lose is your sanity, but that's okay! Serious here btw. I am retarded.

Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell.
If you look at this profile, he has other pics posted of daily account change to the tune of 100k, etc. I doubt it’s fake, unless all that is fake too. But seems like a lot of work to lie for months for fake points
it could if a stock has a huge drop after those options are already out, but TSLA didn't during those times
This is the way.
Amazon will continue going down until a couple days after the s and p inclusion of Tesla. Why wouldn’t they trim a large holding of Amazon to include Tesla if Amazon holds a large position? Not buying puts, but not buying calls until December 29thish.
I'm not buying abnb ipo until a triple bottom pattern. Feel free to average in and see how it goes.

Why are there no otm options?
Interesting position. Looking at thinkback, the strikes available for 1/15/21 were in $5 increments. The lowest tsla got in 2019 was 178.97 on June 3, and at that time the nearest strike to yours, 135, was already well in the money and selling for 76.35. Even the furthest out of the money call, 690 at the time, was .95. These are all pre-split prices. Curious to know how that happened...
It really tickles my G ($1000) spot.
It stinks
Ha gotcha. You did do a lot of DD on the post so gotta give you credit. I'll actually read all the details now since everyone is talking about the post.

It's boomer tier advice but at least you could watch things go up for once.
Meanwhile I’m still bagholding VLDR 😔
Yeah best move is have the willpower to only use 5-10% of your account in risky plays and majority in stonks, gay as it is. It only took blowing my account up about a dozen times to realize this lol
Yes with puts.
It did, and I thought it’s gonna go higher higher, but it ended worthless in the next 4 mins
How?!
This is my first option so I have nothing to compare it to but I was up 80% when the price was at the $29.70 range.

I don't know if that's good compared to other options but it absolutely beats anything I've made from day trading.
Haha are you joking
This is the best advice I’ve ever seen here.

You’ve honestly changed my approach.
NIO rises next week?
Would you recommend playing further dated calls to play the earnings more?

I think the stock will have an earnings runup, starting"now" (in the next 2 weeks)
100% there are algos watching for posts just like this over the weekend and you just bought yourself a “ABNB announcing increased pricing on it’s ipo” headline

Broke is temporary. Poor is a mentality. Get the fuck out of it.
... what exactly? Revenue is down year over year, they cut extra spending, they let go of people and needed a 2 billion emergency injection. Of course they want to IPO now, they need the cash more than ever. Early investors might get out at a nice price too if enough hype is involved on day one.

I’m gonna just get a shit load of shares.I know I’m a pussy
GME thoughts:

No idea what’s gonna happen on Monday, but ER is gonna be Tuesday aftermarket. Console sales mostly won’t show up until Q4 so I expect earnings will be shit. At the same time, we have Ryan Cohen and GME response to his letter demanding changes. As we saw w the leaked rebranding, we will hear good news and hype.

This is a battle of shit earnings vs hype.

I expect a dip by paper hands bitches in response to earnings. Shares price should dip and we should buy in then in anticipation of the future. Changes will be coming and we can ride the hype later, but early on expect a tangible response to shit earnings instead of GME future plans hype.

I might not buy Monday, but I expect to buy shares after an earnings sell off.

Have you tried buying high and waiting till it goes higher?
Why
I’m going balls deep in BB shares. Already up 14% since I bought in but debating on buying more

This dude with his tesla gain on $23 option is making me irrationally mad...

I’m sad now
Just buy and hold xD its the only viable option. 
Honestly saw GME coming from a mile away. All you gotta do is check the charts everytime a new console cycle is released. Then the market was heavily shorting GME when it had a cash position of over a billion dollars. It was madness.
So you are buying calls on AMZN stock to hit 3300 before january ? And on robinhood ? That’s pretty sick where the fck was I last decade

Listen bro. There is a difference between passive income (stocks etc.) and active income (salary for services rendered etc.) and both are taxed differently. To be honest if you are making 90k and 40k from options you should definitely invest in an accountant. Also, fyi google is a very powerful tool. Use it...

You can just import you broker stuff with the account number and a number they give you at tax time and it'll handle it.    If you do a lot of real estate, have to handle the estate of a dead person or own a business/self employed a good accountant is worth their weight in gold

What would you say is the best option to take as of right now regarding Tesla?
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
12/31 35C’s? What y’all think?
No. It has not even merged yet. I am trimming at 20 and selling everything at 25-30
Why am I  buying high and selling low 😞
Man I need to stop looking at this sub I just get sad knowing that in my entire life I’ll probably never make as much as this guy did in a year fuck sakes
Imagine staying poor because you think a stock won't hit 500 dollars.

I'm very comfortable it will hit 500 dollars. Just wait for the Amazon buy out. Even the Cohen buy out will make it moon and that's before the real moon.
This
I've been trading it since it dropped to 26.80. It's made me a lot of money
lol interesting. i’ll have to look into that. thanks boss
Favelas are separate from the wealthy areas. You can kinda forget they exist unless it's nighttime and the entire side of a hill is completely lit up. Anybody who is healthy has nothing to worry about with COVID. My 70 year old mom had it last week and said it wasn't bad at all.
I mean, you are proving my point here by saying Google has additional growth opportunities as well. Why shouldn't Google be priced at 25x sales like Tesla? 

I think you are also missing my earlier points. The entire automotive sales industry in the US is worth $545B annually. Indeed Tesla could sell software into every single unit sold annually, but if that yields only 10% of the total aggregate industry, you are talking about ~$50B of annual revenue from that line of business. Even if that is a reasonable target (literally 100% market penetration of this vehicle operating system and each system comprising 10% of the total sales price of the vehicle itself), does 7 or 8x revenue sound like a reasonable valuation? If so, then Tesla is going to be flat from here on out because the company is currently worth $567B.
Because I own options that went through a 200-1 reverse split and what do you think happened to my 10 options contracts? They're still 10 options contracts not 0.05 contracts.

Same with forward splits. Only people believing you can't Google how a split affects options or never held options through a split.
Seems to be in a falling wedge pattern at the moment. Don’t know if it’ll have enough momentum to break out. 3200 stock bounces down. 3000 bounces up.
It spent one day taking off so far. One half day really, mostly AH. If you believe it will stop there rather than act like the many comparable SPACs in that industry lately, then yes, it's too late. I'm guessing not though.
I can send you a text from me, in September 2019, telling everyone I know Tesla was going to be a winner. They could have just as easily filed for bankruptcy

Stock was at $190-ish pre split. .

No one could have predicted this run.
Lmao, you're delusional if you think the likes of Toyota or Volkswagen are gonna license a Tesla operating system. Tesla isn't even the leading electric car manufacturer, that's only in the US and not even by a wide margin. And for the total car market it's not even close to the Top 10 by revenue. Only thing Tesla is selling is a dream

Its like hitting the strategically lucky lotto. Congrats.
I’m saying average in cause it could go either way and if you bought and held pretty much any major tech IPO with a moat for a couple years you’d be up huge instead of gambling everything on weeklies. I mean the ones **you** picked as examples went up huge even if you bought the highest price on IPO day...

Gratz on pumping a few acquisition companies. I know how to day trade Arrival on a pump when I see DD too. Doesn’t mean I can’t leave some in an IPO to 15x
If that’s the only evidence of photoshop, it’s a pretty good job overall
Everything about GME makes me think it’s overvalued. Brick and mortar video game store. Even the DD post said earnings would be disappointing
Holy fuck
nothing wrong with having preferences man. it's good that you know what you like
If rates go back up, home prices will drop and everyone will be underwater, which means they can't sell unless they pay the bank $$$
Very fucked you are.
The premium right now prices in like a 10% move in that time. You'd need a 3% move very very soon for that to print (next few days)
Might be a good idea to sell soon Tesla is getting shorted a lot right now...

Was it worth it? Funny? Useful?
I think I’m doing this right..but when he bought that option it was a 680c (136x5), and pulling up the chart for it the lowest point was 5/21 at 0.39 per contract.  So either I’m missing something, he got an amazing fill that isn’t showing up in the chart, or it’s bogus.  Either way it would be impressive to buy calls that day and still be holding them.

Naw I got balls swinging my big dick 100k account Im just trying to make money my account swung to 130k to 50k back to 100k now and the only reason it swung back to 100 was become I put a big position on GameStop calls when it was hovering 11 my point is to find companies to flip that are hurting and going to turn around or something new like the purple guy who made 3 mil all these are the real money makers
Wow incredible lol. I sold all my tesla at $1k pre split for a huge profit and bought back in at $440 post split ($2200), huge tp hands regret and im never selling it again 😂

Strategy was always Inverse this sub, look where no one is looking. Bought Leaps during March and September. Also 3T in stimulus had to go somewhere other than the stock market.

Just buy calls close to the money (like, $30, maybe $30.50) and be ready to cash out when it hits. Don't diamond hand that shit.

Why do you think retirees move to states like TX or FL?  You work for years in a high tax state where the jobs are. You contribute to a 401k to avoid taxes. Then you move to a no income tax state in retirement. When you start withdrawing in retirment you now dont have to pay state income tax on the withdrawals.  It's like avoiding 30-40 years of state income taxes on a shitload of money.

Stock currently trading at $600. So a 620c begins printing on a 3.33% up move. That seems super achievable to me. What is your thought process?
That's exactly how I feel. I'm up 76% since August and I hate myself for being such a pussy and not putting in more. I haven't realized any of the profit yet but still.
Try making just a few moves per week for a while it might go well. Or you can open a cash account and there is no 25k minimum, but you will have to wait for the trades to settle before you can enter a new trade

If my MRNA position rockets Monday/Tuesday next week, selling it for profit might be able to buy me exact same number of GME shares I had this Thursday.

If not and GME keeps growing like it grew on Friday, I will have less shares total.

You really abandoned this whole angle pretty quick though. I'm sure you were just asking questions and having a nice experience at the time:

How does a leap 1.5 years out on a high IV even cost 1$
IIRC it started with the bankruptcy of SunEdison. He took a huge position in the company at $22 a share, then it went bankrupt.
Here’s how I’d view it. Everyone expects a decline in sales year-over-year and probably negative net income, while still maintaining positive cash flow.

That’s the base case.

If something in their release indicates they have regressed, the shorts are going to stomp on the longs.

If the earnings are more positive, say increased cash flows or a positive surprise to revenue, or significantly higher guidance, the longs are going to squeeze the shit out of shorts.

So, in my opinion, if we accept the base case. The price change is contingent on forward guidance as well as balance sheet composition. 

For the balance sheet, if they can continue to retire debt and/or repurchase shares, they force short sellers hands. 

If Burry and Cohen increased positions, that forces shorts too since they are probably unwilling to sell at anything close to current prices. 

If console sales are strong and online growth starts ramping up...short sellers are in trouble.

There is a path for the shorts to win...which is banking on prior management failures to continue.
I'd rather pump butterfly than TDOC or NNOX, just from the fact that POCUS can bill as a limited ultrasound. You're right though, there are lots of details and obstacles to widespread implementation. Not sure how accepted their business model will be. I have <1% of my portfolio in shares. What do I know, I'm just a RadTard.
Just get shares
Good on you. Take it and run—give nothing back
I'm 99% sure he is a time traveler, noone is that patient without knowing what will happen.
So how do I execute this special action? Would I have to call my broker to tell him?

are you here to judge or help
I just have a hard time believing there are 63K people who actually think GME is going to have a VW type of short squeeze.  VW was 95% owned by 2 holders who wouldn't sell under any condition so it was extremely difficult for shorts to cover.

If a stock is held by tons of smaller owners, many will sell on the way up so even if there is a squeeze, it will just be up like 10-20% then back down because nobody is doing this because they believe in the company long term.  People are wasting time/money on this "maybe" 10-20% when recovery stocks are going up like crazy (opportunity cost of letting your money sit idle in GME) right now.

If you want to bet on epic GME short squeeze, just wait till it happens (which I seriously doubt it will but assuming by some miracle it happens) then buy puts at the high.  You make money riding it down instead of up and you won't risk leaving your money somewhere indefinitely with a high chance of nothing happening.
At what price you reckon?
That does sound better. Thanks

I net 12k a month (because you are fucking retarded, net = after taxes). I bet that is about half of yearly income. BTW... are you just going to copy what I say? Do you not have anything original to add? Of course you don't!

You should leave these forums and go back to your NSFW ones and drool over women who would throw up before they even touched you. Or you can visit r/politics and herr derr about Trump.
Amazing! We have a similar breakdown but I’m a little more in the commons. Exciting stuff! Wild to think that 95k will likely be worth 350-400k in 8-10 months!
Yeah that’s why I want to be able to day trade more so I can actually use stop losses. Thanks for your perspective
You are clearly messed up in the head. Even so I hope you get millionaire status and have a good life. Fuck you.

Make sure you take a very small risk if your not experienced selling covered calls.

It certainly makes sense if you are just straight up gambling. As I have said multiple times in this thread, people also hit the Powerball. Hell, for $5, you can potentially win $100M. That does not make it a more sound investment strategy than these OTM lottos.

Ouch i was looking at GME when it was 3$ but im canadian and buying USD stocks wasn't part of my appetite. Also, i nearly bought TSLA at 196$ in 2019, but fot the same reason i didn't touch GME, i didn't buy into TSLA. 

I'm a long term hold kind of guy.. id still be holding onto over 800% gains. Fuck. Lmao. 

Instead I've bought WELL at 1.67CAD and sitting on a 300% gain. I guess you can't win 'em all!

Didn’t talk and GME, what kind of week recap is it without GME. Basically the first week in the last year I’ve seen people on here actually saying to buy shares rather than options.
That’s an interesting idea, do you sell OTM calls against it to lower your cost basis?
“Large” a term meaning...large. As in worth $50K each. I asked a question about how that would work on expiration. As in I said “I do not know how that work”. I received great info. It was a good experience. You shit for brains losers who are looking for an ax to grind have run off all the helpful folks because you are sad sack insecure morons who no one wants to interact with in real life or the internet. I do not care what you do in your moms basement. I do not care about your shitty life. But stop trying to be an asshole online. I asked a question. I got an answer. You wanted to be an asshole and are not getting what you want out of this so you are doubling down. I gave you a chance to walk. Now we’re done and it got shittier for you for no good reason.
Won’t be selling calls right away but will be will be once the dust settles
Bigly low. Love to see it go below 90 and stimulus to pass... spy 400
Are you going to buy ?
I’m begging for you not to lose all of this on options. I don’t wanna see this loss porn, it’ll hurt me too much

Perhaps find an accountant that is more creative. I wonder how much you paid him/her. I mean, I could have told you that. You could have "invested" in a group of 24-hour drive-through taco shops that lost money buying outdoor furniture and heaters. Make sure you form a real estate company that happens to own the land those taco shops are sitting on so you can report a loss of revenue when your taco shops fail to pay rent.
Didn’t realize GME earnings are on Tuesday. Thought they were Thursday. Was thinking of buying more shares on Monday... but now debating if I should wait until after earnings.
I’d have to pretend I’m tryna make money
We are the reason they are efficient

Tax question here

How exactly does short term capital gains tax work? Does it just get added to your job income and then that total is then taxed based on your income tax bracket or is there a special tax bracket for short term gains.

Made 90k this year at work and 40k on etrade all options/short. does that just mean i am taxed at 130? or 90 is normal income and then the 40 is seperate and different rate
Tesla is easily a 1T stock. 2T within 10 years. Maybe even 5

Remind me 5 years
For both of our sakes I hope you're a grower

Yep most people can’t get visas to enter as most countries are locked down. Or if you get there you have to quarantine and things are closed anyway. Where are you going?

He’s just the exterior designer but ok
I think the expectation is a shit quarter. So... if it is indeed a shit quarter... stock will probably be relatively flat. If it surprises, it might pump a little. Might even surprise enough to be the catalyst for the squeeze. Who knows

Also might be real. Who cares? Buying leaps on a growth company is a good strat

I bought the same thing Friday. There's huge interest so I wouldn't be surprised to see a run up to 50/share. I caught the last run up back in Jan/Feb and made 400 percent so hoping to do the same again.
Steep as my boner !
Was thinking the same thing. I feel a WSBgod fuckery going on
Can you please say break out and not bust out?

Making it sound like Moderna is whipping its dick out
Not trying to be a dick but if you have a 400k net worth at the age of 28, you’re probably gonna be ok
I’m calling bullshit but in the very slight chance that this is legit I would suggest that you know very well who did this  and that it wasn’t just a random act. Perhaps a disgruntled former lover or coworker? Whoever it was, they would have to have some trading knowledge because somebody who didn’t know anything about trading would have a hard time wiping you out without using options you would just log back in to find yourself long on some shit stocks.

I love CHWY, but I've got the feeling it's going to be a disappointment. Not the earnings themselves, but the market reaction will be underwhelming at best imo.
i rarely talk about gains because i feel like i'm just a bragging asshole if i do that and nobody cares, but i do tend to bitch and vent about my losses and regrets
Don’t worry man just give it to me I’ll help you get a mil
take a coin. flip it. that's what you are doing.
So you bought $675 strike pre-split options at the lows in Summer 2019 and held through COVID dump and V recovery? Wow man, congrats

For any other sub, yes. For this sub, looks right at home.
28k?  


Bitch, my europoor ass will be happy if I make $3,000 total when GME squeeze itself.
With the amt of capital that company puts on bottom line, they gonna be shootin up the charts one day, assuming the ceo isn't as retarded as i am.
So if someone had dropped 50k on those options they would be worth $100mil?
make sure you get a nice jewish CPA, or asian, or an asian jewish cpa that also used to work for the mob.

Travel is open right now. I'm going on a month trip to another country next week.

I looked at the app, and my flight still has 127 empty seats. Some people are scared, most probably just can't afford it. Business travel is nonexistent and will remain that way for another year.

I will take full advantage of the cheap travel until then. But I don't expect it to be crowded anywhere.

MRNA had an interesting week. It got pumped monday to astronomical levels on fda emergency approval application, dumped back down to $138, then found equilibrium in the $150 range where it sat for half the week except on that bogus pfe news where it spiked and then relinquished those gains and went back to $150. Seems to me it's just waiting to bust out again...pfe bad news -> bust out, pfe vaccine good news -> bust out? MRNA good news -> bust out, The only thing going bring it down would be a rejection of fda emergency approval or am I missing something?

What else do you see like this right now?  I’ve got 100k what is the best option you see today like this?
McDonald's is better but Wendy's has good breakfast
Read it, agree with about 40% of it. My lengthy trading experience and % gains, clue me to the fact that this is bad advice. Let me just leave you with this, if you are a good net positive trader at all, then you are leaving way to much alpha on the table.
Did you judge the FB IPO after two months? Lol. You really don’t buy and hold anything? Must be broke as hell
I mean, OP could have had his reasons. I buy way OTM options sometimes when I'm super bullish, not because I think they'll hit, but the risk/reward makes sense logically. Of course this would only be a small amount, I would buy ITM leaps for the main position.

What's illogical is that he was up like 70,000% in Feb, and sat on it just to see it lose almost all profits in March, then ride the once-in-a-century jackpot until now. I doubt anyone on Earth saw this coming.
>Quick, better deflect to that pseudo-psychology again. :)

In hindsight, congrats OP for having the diamond hands to hold through all of that (and to still be holding...) but no, he didn’t do anything right as far as evaluating risk vs reward. That’s like saying someone who won the lottery did something right by buying the ticket, no they didn’t, they’re idiots, but sure, someone wins... that doesn’t mean the risk was properly evaluated, at all.

Can you explain the price action on the warrants and share price. Aren’t they supposed to track each other pretty similarly in terms of $$ movement but %% movement for the warrants is supposed to be amplified? For example. It’s strike price 11.50, so every warrant should have gone up by 1.28 as well

$125 LEAPs on TSLA sounds ridiculous

but remember TSLA was under $300/share pre-split back in 2019 and he could have had the LEAPs since like 2017

$300/share  pre-split is like TSLA being under $60 each right now

Turning water into wine. Jesus has returned.
Yeah, good to be thinking about that play. To be totally honest, I am not sure if this SPAC structure impacts calls. I just know that for previous SPACs the call just converted. I had NKLA calls back in June that I got 100% return on investment, no issue when the ticker changed to NKLA, sold them that day actually. So I guess I am assuming the calls are the same and the warrants on them means nothing when it comes to buying and selling the options themselves. 

As for specific positions. I have a few options but the vast majority of my position is in commons. I'm talking 90-95%. The calls I do have are for March, which might be down a little bit and then I have a minority of Dec 20 calls. Those are getting nailed but they are more OTM like $40 and just a small little position in cases something really is announced this week.

Long and short of it is that I really like the commons. I have justified in my head now that even if I have to wait 12 mo to see a gain I am pleased with, the outcome justifies that wait and any opportunity cost I am paying in the meantime with that capital. If I just took that money and day traded or whatever on GME, I may make some good returns in the short term, but the relative risk there is more and so I will also get burned a lot in 12 mo period. Whereas here, parking half the portfolio there to just sit is a great "play". The chance I don't have a 150%-200% ROI in 12 mo is very low imo.

sounds like the thesis is that stripe is able to give more competitive rates for merchants. What's the reason commercial banks can't match?

This logic chain is such a strawman. Obviously a company can have a negative impact on the well being of people around them. Yea, BP is an energy company but building rigs in risky drilling sites is objectively not the right move but they still did it anyway, which demonstrates negligence. Facebook is a social media platform who lets disinfo get spread everywhere, which is also a sign of negligence. All the examples you listed are people using the companies products for their unintended use too.

Being an engineer in the UK in this space (EV commercial vehicles) and knowing guys that work with Arrivals product at a proving ground, I know they are the real deal and have some incredible talent and top down strategy. I’ve also been trying to raise awareness of the disruption they can bring in a very Niche bus market in the UK, to no avail for the last 3 years. LT fully believe in them and I went hard into C**C for that reason... but the very fact that ticker is banned (I think), is why I took gains at 29.70. When and if the dust settles I’ll go back in, but not in this climate. The hype and pump will shit all over organic growth and unfortunately innovative product and real value will get lost in this shit storm

Go read his post. 

And easy: $500 goes to well over a mil, March happens, he’s a fucking g and hangs tight, watches it reverse, makes his paper loss back, and here we are at current ATHs
oops i cant do basic math in my head anymore
So, options are priced based on varying factors (if you really care about how they're priced, you can search up Black Scholes), but it comes down to the simple question of "how likely is it to happen?".

If the company isn't making a profit, they got a shaky history and their future is uncertain, how likely is it that the stock will triple in value over the next 2 years? Especially in a market where you have tons of alternatives (automotive in general, not specifically electric cars). The answer is, not very likely to happen at all, which is why it's so low.

Yes, people talk about theta but Volatility is actually a bigger factor (it's somewhat a multiplier of volatility but only a (somewhat) multiplier of the square root of theta). Since TSLA wasn't very volatile (small movements = not likely to jump to 3x current value), option prices remain low.

If you want to see a perfect example of this, look at SPY, the 6/17/2022 550C, it's only $1.09. This has a 16 month to expiration and $550 is only up not even 50% from current price. This is because SPY has very low volatility (16.93%), and moves a predictable 8-13% a year (historically). Now, look at COST, same spot (current) price, but COST 6/17/2022 550C averages $5. COST's volatility is only 22.69%, not even a 6% difference yet almost 5 times the cost.

TSLA is too volatile now, so options are through the roof.

TL;DR, depends on both volatility and theta, but volatility has more weight

Betting against Elon Musk’s Tesla
is the widow-maker trade of 2020.

If that’s what you are attempting to do, its a lousy hobby. Find a better one.
x?
That being said $BB 10C 1/21/22 is for future millionaires
Yeah I did - someone talked about Sundial is the only one not from wsb
Has anyone actually shopped on alibaba before? Back when I had calls I went on the website just to see what I was investing in and I would never order anything off there some of that shit looks so sketch. Sold my calls the next day
How far out were the expirations?

up the editing, retard, and bring a little more energy to the table
Shares are the only option for IPOs
Im holding 120 calls in GameStop I may just liquidate everything else and go with a leap on BB because they’re turning their company around
Flawless
Gonna cost you a arm and a leg but I think it’ll be money
Lol...you call me pathetic? I read through some of your comments in your profile. L-O-S-E—R is all I could think of. Go finish making your deliveries for grub hub or whatever gig economy pos position you have, tug one out in your parents basement wondering why you can’t find a woman and get your daily dose of ignorance and selfishness listening to Don the Con. You are destined for homelessness and free cheese at the local food pantry, dumb ass....lol.
You gotta trick the MMs so you gotta sell Monday at close and re-buy Wednesday at close.

21, I bartend at a cash only bar. When I say "quarter jar" what I mean is a big ass bucket where I dump all my quarters every night 😂
Wow mods hate that kayaking company or whatever
Ok
There’s no options for a few weeks. Get your shares early and enjoy the ride. If you get them in lots of 100 you can sell covered calls in a couple weeks for huge premiums

Well fuck.
60% of my portfolio agrees. Stripe or not, I'm following large investors.
CRM is a future $1 trillion company without a doubt. Just waiting for a correction to buy more.
Who’s gonna tell them?

The question is will all other meme stocks sell off as everyone rushes into AirBNB? 🧐
I checked google trends recently and crocs are becoming trendy again. Specially since they are collaborating with famous artist and releasing crocs charms that people likes

Can you give us the fastest growing for 2021?
Lol? I call out idiots when I see 'em. Nothing personal, dummy.

Also, what even is a "large option"?  I've been trading for a good while now and I've never heard that retarded term.  Maybe I'm not as much of an expert as you. Lmao.

[I enjoyed this comment a lot too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7anqp/200000_return_4_presplit_tsla_options_purchased/gepn5kf/) I've never heard or someone referring to deep ITM options as "expiring worthless" but you are really pushing the boundaries for being an overconfident incompetent on this sub.  

Quick, better deflect to that pseudo-psychology again. :)
The rumor that he was in talks with Stripe at some point is completely believable. The idea that the deal is going to happen at this point is not. But I am still banking on him finding a great company for long term hold.
Read this, then you'll see why this is a solid strategy that will produce more wins than losses if your research is accurate https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-find-options-opportunities-low-volatility-2013-08-20
Do you have a recommended place to start learning about options?

Is it better to be long the underlying security?
The Goat
He would have made 500 billion dollars
No it’s true I have a solid cash flowing business now so Whatever i decide Im sticking with my big investment, my biggest gain came from GameStop but I was a little late because of GameStop my 100k account basically broke even all my other 100 trades buying selling short selling covered calls all this bullshit I lost in the end
Pretty damn good odds given the insane brand loyalty, cult following of musk, musk and cohorts history of using options trades to pump .coms, the insane technological potential of tesla on battery, ai, and electirc car fronts...

Was pretty inevitable this would happen if tesla maintained its trajectory. Given the return, it seems liek a evry sensible risk to reward ratio. Theres a million ways to waste $500, this was actually one of the more sensible ways to do it.
Is it???
Did not watch the video but to me - **What's the single best business in the world -** 

It is the credit card industry - spending money you do not have on things you do not need.
Nice my grandma goes to biglots!!! Time to put my life savings in deep OTM calls expiring after Christmas and fat gift card for my grandmother!!!
Better check the list of tools I just put up for OP. I own all of them and that's less than 5% of the net worth of my tools.
620 seems pretty ambitious to me
i know nothing about the stock market. would someone mind explaining what exactly i’m looking at and what he managed to pull off?
And that point in time is in the daily discussion thread. Weekends and night this place is always big 🐻
Cant because europoor broker doesnt allow me to sell options

Great mindset
I'm no doctor but unless they're using microwaves or some alien tech, wireless charging at 3 ft would be horrifically inefficient. Like single digit efficiency.
You can’t get options on ipo
Doesn’t robinhood have a $50k daily withdrawal limit? If you wanted to take out $5M like the OP has it would take you 100 business days.
You don't deal directly with any counter-party, it isnt your (or RH's) problem.     Whatever broker allowed the counter-party to sell the contract is on the hook for it.

Google "how option clearing works"
Already 50% of my portfolio
I’m fascinated by what’s happening in the film industry and so I’ll try to translate it into retard. WB basically changed its status to it’s complicated and wife AMC is having a fucking public meltdown saying WB is going to sacrifice its long standing relationship for the younger hotter side piece HBO Max. Then AMC even vowed to aggressively pursue terms to preserve their business which is basically AMC saying it is going to fuck all of AMC’s friends hoping it will come crawling back. Unfortunately AMC didn’t get no prenup contract and currently nobody wants to get up inside her so she as no bargaining power at all but it don’t stop her from screaming WB a bitch. WB didn’t respond to her hysterics but done already moved on and changed his Netflix password.
Bruh wtf
I'm willing to try this but I need to make money first
Exactly he will be cursing an sending pissed off emojis by next week.
I agree with you in believing the S&P inclusion is the top. Buying put options, you lock in all your gains but the cost is the “insurance.” I highly recommend you to do extensive research quickly because you could set your family/future family up really nicely.
Vaccinated bois for life
You might get to 400,000% if you hold I guess for 10 years.
Just kind of So he is a genius here
Putting 10k in next week.

Undervalued just need patience
Work 5 days just to have 2 days off. What a horrible system
The vaccine which will lead to countries opening their borders for travelers... assuming you know that?

Everyone already staying in Airbnbs to work from home anyway. They are doing just fine with international borders closed but they’re going to rake it in Q1-Q2 as tons of travel comes back

Look at the huge surges on cruise stocks as they cancel sailings for the entire Q1. Airbnb is actually gaining market share permanently instead of making $0 revenue for over a full year...

Ignore the reopening trade at your own risk

Travel + Tech + Housing

All doing super well
Fuckin ouch
Yes please 🤤🤤
He's about to make a lot of $$ lol
[removed]
No I think you’ll be good you should catch a solid run up the start of this week
Expiry is closer than you think. What are you waiting for? I wouldn't take the risk of A drop around the 18th.
Man fk you 🖤
Lol right, I bought 1K of it once it dipped after they hype. Wouldn’t be surprised if it gets pumped again
If you buy this month and don’t sell until next month that’s technically holding for a year and avoids long term capital gains right? 😎
Probably because it was insanely OTM.  No one could have predicted Tesla's unbelievable bubble run.  This guy bought a cheap lottery ticket and it happened to hit.
Doesn’t sound like it. But ok, fair enough. To each their own.
This is the question
Swinging tsla after seeing it pinned Friday seems like free money. 

620c 12/18 inclusion play
Alright.... after like 4 years on reddit I finally put up a profile pic..... WOOOOOO!!!!!
define better lol
Selling covered calls I hope?
You can make that back by 2022 lol
Until the major CSPs come out with their own compression and cheaper EDW (AWS is sort of on the way with Deep Archive and Redshift improvements) SNOW aint going anywhere.

On top of that they are entering into large security data lake plays with Splunk, Exabeam, and AWS which will prompt more enterprise customers locking in. Right now it is cheaper to store your PB datamart/lake/cesspool in SNOW than it is for even the cheapest readily available CSP object storage with strong consistency.

Tl;dr U big retard
Why would it take you so long?
Jesus. Average down?
Damn Crocs and Yeti?! People actually buy those overpriced coolers and ugly slippers?! Idk if it’s because I live in NYC, but I have yet to see anyone repping any of those products
How would he go about closing his positions? Would he just let it assign??
We are going to need burner phones. Lol.
>For now, you either surf on the wave or avoid it. Don't try to block the wave or else you'll get crushed.

this is the way
Upvote if you are retarded
Lol I've always seen selling calls as actual gambling
Just take the screenshot of the 900k post of you're really going that route
Is GME having a shity earnings already priced in? All the articles I’ve read point to “dont get your hopes up”
Imagine the poor SOB on the other side of this trade.
Yup. Gains are always to be had by short term scalping, day trading, and flipping but longer term is where all the big racks are accumulated. 

Think about if you’d bought deep OTM leaps or an overlevered share position in TSLA last year and held. You’d be set for life now. 

Trading is such a multi faceted game and there’s just as many ways to make money as there are to lose it. 

And dammit I fucking love it so much.

How do you have a million dollar paper loss with $500?
I'm not claiming I predicted anything, just that I went long TSLA (for many reasons) intending to hold many years (didn't have a price target).

And yeah I got lucky (not as much as OP though lol)
Ill give you one rn PLTR
eh my tsla leaps are up 10000% in a year and a half.
How do we even invest in Airbnb IPO?
Latin ladies 🤭
Alternative title: "PENNY STOCKS IM PUMPING THIS MONEY.. HURRY AND BUY NOW SO I CAN SELL!!!"
Imagine thinking Google's entire business is there search engine and imagine thinking Tesla is just a car company. It's not like they make software or anything that no other company is even close to having. They could license that software out to every car manufacturer in the world. Think of Windows 10 or OSX. Cars are like computers now so who makes the operating system for the cars? Tesla that's who.

I have no idea im just along for the ride
This post just caused me to lean forward mid cooking dinner and just stand there with my head pressed against the cabinet for a few seconds

Sounds like one of those companies Hindenburg will tank with some bullshit report about how he phoned the company and they didn't know what he was talking about so he went on Facebook and saw the CEO had his phone plugged in a wall in the background of a photo.

Girls care way less about cars than you would think. As long as you don't drive an absolute shitbox or something obviously uncomfortable (giant truck/1st or 2nd gen Miata), cars are basically invisible to most women.
You have inspired me!
Oh he's getting into the Carbon Credits eco-~~scam~~\-system.  They rich pay him money so they can pretend to care about the environment?

You SOB, I'm in.
hope shes not one of your friend's mom.
You realized that from a fake gains post? I don’t believe at all that someone with a $500 yolo ran their account up to $5m and is thinking to just keep going with max leverage. Smells like bullshit to me.
PLTR $50c exp 1/20/23 

see ya in couple years

Yeah, of course everybody can't wait to travel. That isn't going to actually make them travel or start having businesses begin travel again. 

Your friends could hop on a plane now, as there are plenty of other countries open now. What's stopping them?
💎✊
Also, look at the image he linked for his All timeline. You can see the edits if you look closely enough with low brightness. Also, does not display percent change and does not display start date. Fake.
Ya ya ya waaa waaa waaa

Solid third recommendation 😂
What date did you purchase? Awesome job
I'm considering put options as hedge along with selling call options but I think the simplest and maybe the best move is just to sell since I'm thinking S&P inclusion is short term top.  Even if I sell it all, I'm still thinking of picking up some put options.
[deleted]
fuck WSB im just gonna buy whatever Burry buys
To be fair, anyone claiming they could predict that TSLA would be one of the biggest hype stock bubbles in history is probably lying and just got lucky.  Nothing wrong with being lucky, but everyone lucky thinks they are a genius in retrospect.
Upvote me if you downvoted him
I lost 90%+ of my money in 2017, pulled out and didnt trade for a while, heard about covid ramping up, threw the last bit of money not reserved for taxes in my checking account into airlines puts, doubled it, then rolled it all into TLT calls, 5x’d it, waited a day, threw some more into TLT calls again and 5x’d that too. Lost a little bit on some trades in the middle but ended the whole thing +1500% ish and was finally up all time.
Lol I know I’m busting balls as someone who has never even come remotely close.
Lucky is slipping on the pee pee at your local Costco and getting a 50K payday. This is SkillZ

There are also people who make $10k off of a $100 bet during the course of a weekend and don’t have to wait two years to start withdrawing their profits; the point is, learn it all.
The thing that's 19k now was under 5 bucks less than 10 years ago. Almost 4000x. F.
I just creamed my pants
How did he gain so much exactly? Eli5
Congratulations 👏👏👏.

If we've learned anything in 2020 its don't bet against Elon.

The 18 billion dollar loss for the short sellers still haven't earned it.
To each their own

Everyone picks stocks differently, my advice works for me, maybe other people won't pick correctly. I rely on fundamental research and timing entry and exit based around volatility and premium discounts

I thought it is Monday the 21st?
if were talking pershing capital mgmt it's market cap is 7-8B publically, which I assume is the bulk of it. Unless they have more of their funds stored elsewhere?
Sure but with 100k in that position he probably would have sold.
10 debit debit spread leaps are going to be a better use of capital that 4 call leaps 99% of the time.
Thanks man. I was somewhat waiting for that lol
I don't know what happened I turned 🌈[🐻](https://emojipedia.org/bear/) 2 seconds before market close.
I simplify the whole process for myself, I look at monthly and yearly historical charts and look for increases in IV and spikes over time. Large trade volume plus a lot of large swings are ideal. Spikey historical charts like bart simpsons hair, but with a bullish trend, not trading bearish over the years and not trading sideways too much.

If the stock is bullish and has spikes high and low, that means both bears and bulls are active in the stock and IV fluctuates a lot.

So if it is at a low IV point then it can be reasonably deduced that the IV will spike again in the future so now is an ideal time to buy a bargain cost contract
Good luck with that. You'll probably panic sell the next day
Put that shit into Amazon and sell weekly calls. Boom. Set for life.
Thought Trask was Heisman worthy watching his first game this year. Be disappointed if he don't get it
Well SNOW IPO was like three months ago and already doubled

FB was a few years but up 15x

15x before even selling covered calls for holding an obvious meme tech stock is free fucking money dude. Make fun of it like you make 15x per month but realistically you ain’t doing that with options without some major losses too
Didn’t hear the word retard in the first 60 seconds. Not watching the rest
Meanwhile she’s telling some nice dude she’s looking for something serious and doesn’t feel that spark between them. 🤣
Consider selling weekly puts, the embedded borrow fee makes them slightly more profitable than a same strike ATM buy/write.

If that’s a foreign language, just buy half now and half after ER.
Sir this is a casino
If you guys are looking for a good one check out NWL. I bought like $55 worth because of a post on here and on Friday it went from .06 avg cost to 13 cents. Over 100% profit. Should have out more money but I had no idea. This post makes a lot of sense. Also the calls for 30c have gone up in price as well but still like 10cents so potential growth. Ppl need Mason jars and Elmer's glue
Worked out well 👌
UCTT or NNDM
Crocs gang rise up!
This guy is nice, I definitely hope to see it gone with some epic loss porn
Easy to say now. Also depends on account size.
If my vote matters, which it doesn't, his flair needs to be "My other tranche is your wife"
Nice try, retard. Dont try to play it off like you’re the WSB helper when you made this post to talk shit. You just exposed your excessive confidence (and chromosomes) to the internet.

Who cares? So long as he's sensible enoguh to not yolo everything, he's set for life. He can put 3 million into property, provide himself with a solid income forever, and yolo the other 2 million 1k at a time, and he just has to get this "lucky" 1 in 200 times to double his money.

My interpretation "I wouldn't play any weeklies on the week of S&P inclusion" (which is next week so I don't understand what is really being said here.
Other way around. Having studied this the US Govt only got involved after Academia and Statistics kicked it around that people were actually employed full-time and going insolvent. Old problem. Probably older than you.

Do you think the average person that does patient option strategies can get this or do you have to trade day after day and use complex straddles or whatnoy

[deleted]
For me, personally, I would say anything below 40%, if all other factors are ideal, then I would consider it. 

25% or lower would be a no brainer to me, bargain options premiums at that

But other factors need to be considered. IV and vega alone aren't enough to make a decision. You have to know the stock well and trust your understanding of their financials and fundamentals, picking a winner with this strategy involves ruling out a lot of high IV or high P/E or otherwise crazy overbought stocks that have ridiculously high premiums and lower payout using this volatility strategy
350k
Just an added note, not sure if he mentioned as I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but:

Stop losses are not magic. If the CEO gets caught in a corpse fucking money laundering ring after market close the stock is going to OPEN 50% down and your 3% stop loss will be as fucked as those corpses.
Diversity training and hiring practices do not extinguish prejudice – they actually promote it.

now we are on wsb and nobody cares about that here, period.

Realized over the weekend that trying to trade short term you’ll never make big money all these guys that hit big on Wall Street bets actually invested in one company they believed in and used high leverage with call leaps all of us who are making short term calls are losing making losing making and mainly losing in the end. I’m going to put my time to find the next couple companies  on the cheap and just yolo leaps and wait maybe sell otm calls on big spikes to collect on the way
Usually around 11 AM EST. Also it’s Thursday

I have the same conviction. It's also in DOW which helps it a lot in terms of stability. I won't buy an OTM call though. Just call spreads, short puts, shares, etc.
I'm hoping we don't push it too far.

Is anyone familiar with the stock WATT (Energous)? Like 5 years ago they were rumored to have a truly wireless charging solution from like 3 feet away but since been cast aside. Stock currently trades at $1.84. Just seems like one of those stocks that could be up 500% overnight based on buyout news or something.
No.  I'm.....happy......for him 🤬

Also, I see you post a lot in the NSFW reddit forums. I'm 100% convinced you are a complete pathetic fat fuck 30 year old plus virgin loser who probably lives with their parents. Shame. 

BTW, just to rub salt in the wound... My wife is a personal trainer who looks better than the girls that you are drooling over in the NSFW reddit forums. Damn.
Those programs exist to appease a loud and obnoxious minority. They don’t cost too much money and make life for the PR-Team so much easier.
Probably his phone bill, but his wife’s boyfriend is the one paying it so it’s irrelevant.
hey it's me, the relative you like
I bought $200 in tesla calls at the same time, and sold at a  28k gain when coronavirus appeared. I never bought back in after the crash.

Worst way to make 28k ever. At least I can buy some really nice rope.
Sir, this is a Wendy's
AMD's move after the XLNX deal imo will be somewhat similar to CRM's future move after this WORK deal. Crush earnings but go down due to an acquisition. Then slowly climb its way back up. I think CRM hits 240 by end of the year if SPY doesn't crash.
Plus almost all the IPOs he mentioned are up 100-1500% 😂
Margin?
It's going to take a while before travel goes back to how it was last year. AirBnb is still kinda looking for last year's valuation with numbers that won't arrive there for at least a couple years.

You're right, that's a 120% fee on all profits made, math checks out.

Ackman is wearing stripes in twitter profile pic.  Stripe merger confirmed.
Looks at FB: up over 1500% since IPO

Looks at SNOW: up 100% from recent IPO

Yep I agree. All in on Airbnb for buy and hold or you’re retarded
Fake. Clearly fake. You can see where the background color doesn't match from where he edited it if you closely enough with the right brightness. Also, the timeline is missing percentages and start date. Prove me wrong, I'm begging you.

I and many rational people would have taken profits about 1000 times before hitting 200000%. And it would have been a smart move. That post is going to lose people more money than he made.

What does a ni🅱️🅱️a gotta do to get $10,000?
GUH!
Found myself swing trading on Coinbase Pro, what the fuck else is there to do while the market isn't open?
🤡🤡🤡
I'm still holding the $300 call which are now $60 calls after the 5 for 1 split.  It's currently worth around $269,000.  Not bad for $3,950 gamble.  Not the crazy gain OP has with his $680 calls but mine were much more conservative than his.  The $420 calls, I sold in March this year when everything was crumbling.  I think I made around $40-50k on those.  Wish I had kept it like the $300 but it's ok.  I had bunch of other strikes like $350 and $600 I converted into shares and am up millions from all the TSLA calls and shares.
Hey lazr is really promising they have fat patent portfolio and deals with volvo and possibly toyota they should be 20 rn imo but I don’t wanna sell and watch it moon as more catalysts come into play. And people will see they are the best in the business
Hope so :)
No hahaha

I had to take a shit after seeing that retard make $1m on the $500 TSLA trade, the greatest gains porn I've ever seen
😂😂😂
Nah that’s for the rari savings
enjoy your trash
Only way TSLA every goes down is with another split
Didn't know the US Govt was a "loud minority".
They do temperature check on your DXY? Seems a bit high, puts on your grandma.
It's a potential candidate, but you'd have to be bullish on the stock moving up.

The premiums are high because the value of the underlying is high, too. 

BBY $105c 01/21/22 are $16.68 per share x100 = $1668 upfront investment per contract

If that is within your options budget (if you have a $30,000 portfolio for example, this would be a lower risk play)

the greeks are solid... 36% IV currently, delta .58, vega .43 (very high), theta is -0.019 which is not too bad but it is a little high so if the underlying doesn't move then theta will eat more profits away from you over time 

it's down 13% past month and testing resistance at $105-107 currently... 

It could keep dropping, you have to decide when you think the best entry is.

If it keeps dropping then these premiums will go down in price and you should've waited. But if it bounces from here and you timed your entry then the premiums will increase and you will realize profits if you sell them at that point.

The good thing is that LEAPS give you a lot of time to be right.

But if you're on the wrong side and the price keeps dropping, then you have to weigh the risk to reward of letting the option expire worthless vs trying to sell it before expiry at a loss but recoup some profits from it.... vs holding and waiting and hoping it turns a profit to sell at
Ride together die together
now do it again

no, retarded.
You know what at least I’ll get a tax break this year ffs.
I don't think I've ever had a stronger conviction that I'm going to make money than I do now with CRM, and for that reason, I feel I'm absolutely going to lose my ass on it.
Nav is 20$ meaning if he doesn’t close a deal he will buy back the shares at 20$+interest, and before the deal goes through you have the option to sell your shares back for 20$. So even if the price dips under 20$ (which it won’t imo). You still have the option to redeem them at 20$

haha, wellll im down 5k now but thats pretty good from going 53k down to 18k. the hyln run a couple weeks ago was best thing that could have happened-- my covered calls were exercised when it hit $25 and was able to day trade again without PDT limit. now at 48k and holding 10 calls of AAPL for March 2021 @ 120 strike. what got me in trouble in the first place was going big in XLE. awful move.

Tesla tards how we feel about next week
8 friends are in a spac I recommended.   This better not go tits up.
You can sell as a regular stock for market price or redeem it for its NAV as a special action when the merger happens. Thats the only time you can redeem it. But because you can redeem it for NAV, there is a floor in the price that is reflected in the market trading price. The NAV is slightly over $20.

Some shares. They split I made a couple hunny then bought booze.
Sorry. While I appreciate you spending the time to write this post, you are giving suspect to bad advice! Anyone who says almost Guaranteed, I have to laugh at and file away as someone who has no clue how to trade. You also say LEAPs will almost certainly go up at some point, is also a horrendous statement. If your strategy somehow is working for you in some way, good for you, but this advice is just not good in so many ways.
First one is free so you are good.

John Cena
Yes
Yes but you’re ignoring that they took on massive debts, gave out all kinds of convertible notes which will convert into shares later causing dilution, and they’ve given rights to their ships and islands away already in order to get their extremely high interest loans

So yeah they’re worth $40 just on current share dilution, probably $30-35 after future share dilution, and probably about $20 after you factor in they’ll be paying debts for a decade before they pay another dividend

Check the IV. Still some room left, but you´re kind of late, so please be cautious.
I don’t disagree with a lot of what you said, however something to consider with the big guys is that they have so much money invested into combustion engine manufacturing and can’t just pivot to EV. There’s no guarantee Fisker makes it, but I think they have the makings of a brand people can get behind. I don’t want to look back in 5 years and see Fisker at 10x current price and hate myself for never giving it a shot. I got in early on 5/21 and 12/21 options as a placeholder. If things look good near May, I’ll consider executing and holding the shares, if it continues to improve, I’ll execute my 12/21’s and continue as a long hold.

That is not any definition of a lotto ticket that I'm familiar with. Where do you buy lottery tickets that have a "decent chance of being worth something"?
You're totally right.

except, this one time, I had options that were dying, for some reason I figured, if it's losing money this fast, I bet I could lose WAY more if I bought a handfull more.  The next day it actually rebounded, got above my average price, but never hit my initial price. I managed to sell the whole lot for a small gain instead of a loss.  Then I realized, I'm a fucking god... HERE I GO!!!

I'll use my own contract for example that I bought a month ago.

On November 11, 2020 when INTC was trading at ~$46, I bought INTC $70c 04/16/2021 for $0.09 (x100) $9 per contract

since that time the contracts have gone up by 333% to $0.39 (x100) $39 per contract

INTC was worth $46 underlying on November 11, but today on Dec 5 INTC is worth just $52

So a $6 increase in the underlying stock in 1 month has caused these contracts to be worth 333% more than they were 1 month ago.

That's how I trade, these are the contracts I look for. If at any point between 1 month and 1 year the stock moves, you have opportunity for these LEAPS to print profits. Sometimes huge profits, way more than the 10% underlying movement would produce by owning shares (INTC underlying has "only" increased approx 12% in the past month, imagine if you owned a LEAP like this on a stock that moved 100% up in underlying price in a month during your ownership of the contract)
Why are you still talking to me. I do not know why you are having a shitty day and were looking for someone to pick on and randomly found my conversation about large options, but I promise you picked someone who frankly could not give a shit less about anything you have to say and it’s just bad luck for you in target choice. However, since you’ve clearly got some stuff going on, you get to walk on out. No worries, no issues. Hope everything works out and maybe next time things are sucky maybe talk to someone about what up and not try to hurt strangers feelings in the internet. Won’t make you feel better if it succeeds, promise.

Pick any stock that's ~50% below it's all time high. Buy OTM calls at 3-4x the current stock price and date them as far back as they can go. Wake up 2 years later hoping the stock is trading at 13x the price it was when you bought the options... and then sell.

If it sounds retarded, it's because it is. You can't make retarded gains without retarded trades.

Boring Saturday. Thanks for noticing. Lol. I like all of the doubt posts.
I am mostly focusing on macro economic climates at the moment, specifically the Dollar/Euro. Take a look at this chart:

 https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1335309797088964608?s=20 

What does this mean? One of two things is going to happen. Either the Dollar is going to fall to the Euro regarding Russian exports soon, or the Dollar is going to rise temporarily. This is important to keep an eye on, because if the Dollar rises, we could see a pullback in the markets of 5-10%. If this happens, and equities regain strength/support, I am going all in long on Gold and Cryptos. If the Dollar just keeps falling without a pullback or concern from the Fed, I am jumping in Gold/Cryptos. Either way, I predict commodities (especially precious metals) will outperform equities in 2021, but it's all about entry.
And, we say it here often.

If you exercise the 20 calls, won't you have effectively paid $463 bucks for 10,000 TSLA shares at $.0463 per share?  Wouldn't taxes only be applicable when you go to sell the shares? 

The total taxable amount would be 10,000 x share price - $463 in whatever year you sell the shares.  I'm just hypothesizing here, I don't know how the taxes actually work, but this makes the most sense to me.
You can make more at Wendy's. Should definitely consider a job change.
If its not +200 / -200 % within a week of buying is it really r/wallstreetbets

Nice.
Where did I contradict you.
I think I just got a boner from that.
This question actually changes so much
Wtf do the numbers flair mean?? Still haven’t figured it out lmao

wouldnt the stock usually dip right before earnings? so red monday?
I can’t remember if this is high or low. Sounds low?
Man, it really hurts seeing so much gain porn here. This last year had to be the easiest ever to make money and I somehow fucked it up. Down 5k all time at the moment. Can't believe it.
So did you quit your job?

Some retard yeets 500 bucks at ridiculous otm Tesla calls makes ~ a milli. Meanwhile I yeet 500 bucks straight into some computers hedge. Smh my head.
For Canadian MJ? Depends on your risk tolerance. Best fundamentals are CGC and APHA. ACB is near bankruptcy but you can make serious money on the quick swings. CRON, TLRY get good attention but they as well don’t make any money yet.
How are you going to pay your accountant now?

Yes, but Friday was less of a gamble.
Please explain in what field you see this, genuinely curious. I did civil engineering and I have never seen MM used for a million. Usually because we just write out 1,000,000 or 1.0 x 10^6. Also, I live in the US, maybe its different elsewhere. Kinda fascinating.
Just do long dated boomer stocks if you need a sure safe play
Every time you meet a lady in a bar she determines how she feels about you before she sees your car. And that’s how I look at things ever since my repo earlier this year.
What?
At least 5% of GME is playing earnings.
What were your other trades master?
your article is from July aka 5 months ago lol
Taleb is my hero for sure. If not for him this would not have happened!

Trades like these makes me want to sell all my TSLA and YOLO on PLTR.
F I saw the post about burgers below so I check SHAK's price. It's at an ATH? The fuck...they needed like a PPP loan like in April but ended up returning it since there was so much controversy. Man I love Shake Shack too but at an ATH?

I like to trade tranches on long delta, usually hedging with some theta LEAPs. Of course if the accrual gets too high I make sure to check the Bollingers and split collateral to consolidate with other commodities.

Hmmmm maybe that dude who yolo'd 20k on tesla leaps last year for like 8 milly
What is this "slow and steady growth" you speak of?
Because that's still like a $2800 per month payment with mortgage insurance, and you still have taxes and insurance on top of that. 

Renting is probably cheaper.

Anyone have a solid well researched play to save my account in the next week? I’ve blown up my account on meme calls and Mr. Margin wants his cut.
I have 100 shares of Nio at avg. cost of 36.05. Do you recommend selling and buying back in at a lower price or holding?
Lol, "I know options very well" and you need to be schooled on simple concepts.  And you still don't understand them, or how algos work.

Why don't you try it and report back? I've already done it so I know exactly how it works you dumbfuck.  I'm not the one on WSB simultaneously asking for an explanation while claiming to be an expert on the same subject. Rofl.
Stratechery flat out said “according to a high level source Stripe won’t merge with a well known SPAC”. Thoughts?
The Fisker SUV kinds looks like a Kia to me. If it was this easy to slap on a cool shell on an EV drivetrain and make massive profit then Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche would already be killing it. But they’re not. Tesla’s revenue so far this year is around 20billion and Fisker projects 13 billion in 4 years? Tesla has the charging network, software, brand name, and self driving to squeeze the life out of most premium brands. Not to say Fisker stock cant go up from here bec all things EV go boom, but this is clearly an EV bubble with 20-30 names and there will be 3-4 good companies 10yrs from now.
You're bringing down the vibe, man.
Holy fuck.

Yo, OP, what is it like to be you?
Using google slides!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I was told that about TRNE when it was at 16, bought in anyway and closed at 19 friday

What is the largest amount of money someone has made on WSB?
We got currency traders here?
7 figs. Worked 2 job through HS and college, was a smart kid and got scholarships to pay for school and lived at home to save money so the folks gave me the diff to max 401k from 18-24, then I got a good job and did it myself while gambling here since 2015. I'll be done working working in the next 10yrs
bro we don’t deserve
I fugured a year ago or so. Interesting
Is Best Buy a good example of this as it’s been over sold after just hitting an ATH and Christmas around the cordoned, suggesting IV might go in your favor?
TLDR: SPAC MONEY GO BRRR
Tell me you made some good money off those calls!
PMI. Correct
One of my dad's boomer friends called and said he's thinking about getting back in the market cause he thought a Biden win would crash the market. FOMO hasn't even begun to start boys.
I feel so so so sick. I just threw up my buffalo chicken pizza slice
I know TA is just crayons but SUMO had the golden cross and then more or less went parabolic
This is correct
We could.  With them test running their rebrand it makes it even more likely there is a huge call.  Getting super excited
If you want to buy, maybe do so for the earnings bump this week and dump before they report, and then buy the dip after it is done dumping post-earnings.  Personally I think the real short squeeze is gonna be for Q1 and Q2 earnings next year, after PS5 sales have had a chance to really bump their earnings. At least that is my guess and my play with GME; check out their market data from the PS 2/3/4  releases 😘
You beat the game
Get the fuck out now!!
Good announcement

Omfg.
Thanks. I set found out this week your user doesn’t check out. You don’t learn until you lose the proper amount. I lost the proper amount. Literally at break even since July when I started. Kinda a miracle... gonna size the duck down and study. Thanks man.

It was possible in 2019 and was way OTM. 

Options have exploded and fucked up pricing  now.

Before I do that I want to ask you a question because I'm getting the vibe that you're young.

**Where do you think the diversity and inclusion programs for all these major companies came from?**

I ask because I don't think you create an entire department and commit a billion or more to it (Bank of America did) because it's good business. I can go get the Apple Hit Pieces but answer me that first; why would anyone care if no one cared? How could we be having this conversation?
Another post a month later:

"This sub has ruined my life" (shows -100% screenshot)
For real why
Stripe may be playing hard to get, but they claimed they didn’t want to go public because they’re still “young” even after 10 years and they don’t have a problem sourcing more capital.

Do you have to have the $926000 in your account though in order to purchase those stocks?
Warm and toasty inside
Yeah not at all. I'm not usually a day trader but to try it out I threw in 1000 dollars into a ToS acct with this methodology:

1. Join a discord that day trades on small caps to see what people are doing

2. Find a trade that is under 70 RSI, trending above the SMA line for 3 candles or is clearly starting to quickly jump.

3. Set a trailing stop loss for 5%, that way if the stock continues to rise throughout that day and then suddenly drops I've only lost 5% off the high

I've only been doing it a week and I'm up 30%. It could honestly have been more if I followed my rules and not just blindly jumping in once or twice and pulling out early. The PDT rule is also pesky but I don't have 25k to throw in lol
Feel like you are forgetting that literally there’s a huge cohort of people currently retiring and finally taping into their retirement accounts. I think this won’t last past 2020 but who knows.
Well lithium is the future
I think the Chewy CEO will get his way either by buyout or persuasion on the board, both of which is good for us
Lol, this is fucking hilarious. I worked in Detroit from 2013-2015, and at that time I was saying Detroit is running a solid 15-20 years behind anything outside of Detroit in the US. Like 50% of people still smoking a pack of cigs per day. It was actually kind of refreshing, but the grind was real.
I wouldn't play and weeklies on S&P week.
What are we expecting lazr to climb to this week? 41?
There is, but each new generation is looking for more and more complexity.  Average IQ has been going up massively for over 100 years now (average is actually always 100, but the cognitive ability to hit 100 has been increasing).

Esports still has a long ways to go, I won't argue that - but the inroads made in the last decade are insane.  I had the opportunity to do the esports thing when I was in college (10 years ago), but you couldn't make a comfortable living off of it at that point and 2.5k viewers on a live stream was considered massive.

It is definitely going to happen in our lifetime

What are your thoughts here on shares versus calls? Seems like some March calls would make sense but the warrant thing here really makes me wonder if shares is the better bet. Maybe split the baby and go halfsies? I’m less certain what happens when you have calls with a unique SPAC like this where you get warrants for each share. Trying to decide if the calls are worth the premiums.
Cash out high before the bubble pops

As someone holding 500+ shares of SUMO since mid-Oct, I like you
no
In that case I would just hold, I don't see a point in gambling on this short term if you're certain that it will go up long-term.
but what kind of gain to the underlying would you need for 200-10000% returns?

use INTC as an example
It was like just posted here today, I don’t have the link tho.
Ya. Can just use margin too.
70-80$ for a 5c and like 30-40$ for a 7c imo its positioned to compete with Samsung if they play their cards right.

If you want to look at historical option prices (even expired ones), use Thinkback. It's a function on ToS. It's under the Analyze tab, which was where I got the data. 

Did a bit of googling before I found something that showed actual old data. I guess this is one of those things that most of us commoners don't care enough to make any of the websites or brokers fix, and if you're large financial institutions, you have your own Actuaries and data to work with.
Think you might be waiting a while for a response to this.

No i don’t think you’re over thinking. If the stock rises only a little bit though towards the strike it’s more valuable and he can sell for a gain. Doesn’t need to hit the strike. But because of theta he needs to exit fast if the stock doesn’t moon.
Yup, you’re fucked. Lifetime of gambling addiction or poverty.

I think part of it was due to being pissed at HFTs. Seems like what he did is still being done all the time, maybe not with as large orders. I know in the cr-y-toe world, it happens all the time. I've always assume spoofing goes on regularly which is why I generally ignore the level 2 orders.

Noted. 

And what about the cost?

Even the further otm leap for 18months away is nowhere near as cheap.
There was little doubt Tesla would break out. It just wasn’t clear when. Their revenues had 5xed from 2014-2019 but stock was sideway. I knew I would make money, didn’t expect this kind of money though.  The same contract was worth 5X just a few months earlier. Not a lottery ticket.
Find an 18 month leap somewhere for 0.23 on a 300$ stock and I will suck you dry.

Bull shit.

You do that. Believe me when I say that I will genuinely enjoy the schadenfreude when ABNB is down 20%+ a month after it debuts. In fact, I will enjoy it so much, I will probably take my wife out to dinner at a Michelin star restaurant in Manhattan and toast to your loss  🥂
No.
You're degree teach you anything about how central banks actually work or just theory? The fed is full of PhDs in economics and they are pretty inept at creating anything besides PR.
try buying one that goes up in price after you buy it
That’s what we get for getting the market pumped up lol.
you also could have bought before earnings
Hey. Really good shoutouts on JWN M KSS for earnings comparisons. Thanks for pointing them out to me. Best of luck.

Read this to understand what I mean by low IV being profitable, it's only in reference to trading options using this strategy, it isn't about the underlying, it's about the IV and vega

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-find-options-opportunities-low-volatility-2013-08-20

if that makes sense, but yes I get what you're saying as well, that's just a different strategy. With trading, there's no one size fits all ofc.

TLDR low IV = low cost premium = bargain contracts
Call no make money. How make call make money???????????????????
yes, but it wasn't a $40 stock with a $680 strike, it was a $200 stock with a $680 strike, and now it's 5 $600 stocks with a $136 strike

Cash is depreciating at a faster rate and it will continue to do so in 2021. For that reason only, I believe this market will continue to soar high. People will be technically forced to take their cash and savings and invest in the only appreciating assets like the stock market and the real estate. This is not even a bubble, the mother of all bubble is just forming.

I've got a nice quality fishing net that might have a resale value of $35 if I'm lucky. The market's tough these days though.
I've read so many different takes on the GME squeeze and they all seem to come to the same conclusion that even if the squeeze doesn't pop off they're will still be gains to be made within the next 3-4 months. Going in on more GME on Monday

I feel sorry for the poor soul who wrote those options
Can someone tell me what this company even is, I e invested in something I know nothing about tbh
Yeah, I need to be 75-85% in leaps, covered calls, cash, and DITM calls. Less than 15% in weeklies and OTM calls/puts.

You definitely know the word Im talking about. Derogatory term for a gay man.
gotcha. I'm interested to see if there are any forms of lending designed for exercising options. So long as the premiums/interest you pay on that loan don't outweigh the difference in gains, its a win-win for everyone

No, he was making 300k a day or something and on that day he threw up some big sell orders as a spoof since the market was already dropping. He made like 900k that day and stopped. The market dropped more after that.

They very conspicuously neglected to explain the mechanics of how what he was doing caused it. But even if he didn't he was kind of a cheat. Manipulation is pretty fucked up whether it's a big bank or pj trader doing it.

Will PLTR hit 60 by EOW?
NEE has average volume of 7M

that's decent but I personally look for larger traded stocks like >25 million average volume. That's not to say this is a bad pick.

NEE has strong buy signals https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nee/analysis?ltr=1 from analysts

The Delta is .5 and vega .3  and Theta is below -0.01  which is good

It has 25% IV right now... That could spike to 100% IV at any point, for example.

In this case, every 1% increase in IV (so from 25% to 26% IV) would produce $30 profit on each contract, if I'm not mistaken (based on 0.3 vega)

TLDR if delta is > .5 and vega >.2, and theta < -0.01, and IV < 25%

Then generally these can be profitable LEAPS to trade off of IV

But another factor besides all of this.. your premium you're willing to pay for example... the $90 LEAPS are farther OTM and cost only $2.43 up front as opposed to $6.8

So it's easy to manage risk in this way and their delta and vega are decent enough to justify the lower price. They also have even lower theta which is better for recovering losses potentially

Then consider the stock's 1 year and 5 year charts, for some sort of predictability about Volatility of the stock.

I look for a lot of spikes up and down, but also being bullish you would want an up trend of course. And your entry would be timed at a low point for the stock of course.

If all of that matches then I think you will be more successful at picking winning options than if you were to gamble with weekly's.

Just my opinion though, and what works for me
I never said I’m going to buy it now, but I could’ve clearly made a lot of money if I bought at open.
Must be the doordash tips

Ohh shit you really are a noob. Ok so OTM refers to out the money options. Weeklies means expiring within a week or two. Maybe take an hour or two to google those and then go all in on Monday. Retarded risk, retarded reward. This is the way.

Idk, you’re posts seem like you’re pretty retarded and have no clue what you’re doing. Your first post is literally asking wsb what the next meme stonk is.... lmao
My first ever play. Bought 6 at $1.43 after thanksgiving. Would have bought 7 but RH only fronted me the $1k and was $15 short. Had no clue what I was doing and 100% deserved to lose. Monday came, I realized I was hosed, and I started reading. I’ve been reading for a week, and I still don’t feel comfortable making another play. I’d like to get in on CRM but everything still feels like playing video poker black out drunk. Just chiming in. 

TLDR: lost about $900, deserved it, started reading.
Why would I listen to them about business news of they can't even make money trading.
Really have been liking these post, keep it up!
I'll restate my thought on the matter:

A lot of people would have no reason to sell the stock because the stock has not gone up that much from IPO and still has room to run. It's basically extreme paperhands.
This guy FAWKS
Nope, the play here was $500 in OTM options he bought in 2019 and held.
Isn’t the point of virtual concerts to stay away from other people?.....
He didn't stand to lose anything. $500 dollars was the loss if the option expired. That is nothing.

The entire market cratered like 35% in three weeks. Since options are levered products, and the underlying stock moved down to like $80 (implying he would have needed at least a 50% move to get out of delta hell), it is likely that the value of his holdings dropped 60 or 70% from their recent peak of February. They may not have been red, but they certainly could have been pretty close.

That’s why I suggest to buy put options to protect your current level. If the stock price decreases, you are “insured.”  That way you don’t have to pay Capital Gaines on your initial purchase at all.

This may be a very stupid question, but if I did the math right, your options contract would net you ~2.74 mil if you exercised it on expiry (assuming TSLA stock price stayed around 600, which it likely wouldn't, it'll have gone even higher). You said you've made 5 mil off your plays, what's stopping you from exercising your option and selling immediately?

Would you pay $600 billion (the entire GDP of Sweden plus another $50 billion cash) for a company that supposedly made a few hundred million in the last quarter?

That’s the problem. When you win big, you become overconfident. It’s very difficult to keep a level head. Sometimes it works out and you win even bigger, making you even more overconfident. And sometimes you end up losing it all.

That’s good strategy, most people here would just keep betting it all until they’re back to zero lol. I feel you though I’m the same way
Yeah, I'm on a mission to recover my losses
Sold all my SPACS for this 🥴
I’m not stalking anybody you just always happen to be spamming in MY subreddit ffs
TSLA was about 180 at the time, pre split. Still 180 to 680 is mind boggling, let alone what it has done since.
That’s a lot of halves

Google has competition? What other search engine have you used in the past five years?

Why does Tesla get some kind of unlimited revenue multiple whereas Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and the others who are in much larger industries are bound by actual performance? For context, the entire auto industry in the US is worth $545B annually. That is basically one year of Walmart revenue. Even if you assume Tesla eats up the entire solar industry as well, that is only another $18.7B. 

Tesla market cap at close is $567B, so if you add up $545B and $18.7B, that comes to $563.7B. The company is worth the entire annual size of the automotive and solar industries in the US currently. If that is only a bit overvalued, this is a way bigger bubble than 2000. At least 2000 had proper irrational exuberance over a truly nascent industry in its infancy.
it was at 200
This is the way

Your not lol I do have some GME BUT need some more so will buy some when I can #paper money poor
I think you’re right and what he’s saying is because he doesn’t typically hold long or through the weekend he would be looking to exit his position soon. And because it’s got much higher volume it will be much easier for him to exit fast.
I just sold my INTC 2022 50 calls on Friday and bought 2022 55 calls.
Ok what’s the next $500—>$5M play? Anyone got a guess?
The share price was like $230 at the time.  He bought options with a strike at $680.

$1 premium for an 18 month option nearly 200% out of the money is plausible.
I know. And for those kind of massive dick swings. He needs to live in my basement. Shit, I might even give up the master bedroom to him.
Lol. Dude’s acting like they sell beepers and Furbies.

He made a robinhood account for his 13yr old bro, deposited some money in it, and told lil bro that his job was to make the number on the screen smaller (i.e., buy puts)

Weekend Dow green. Lol. Stimulus hopes.
Okay, so NCLH had 213 millions shares before COVID. They now have 315 million. That should make their $60 ATH actually $40.5 since they diluted 67.6%. The current price is $26.44, making it get close to that peak. Does my math make sense at all?
Yes, do not enter trades on some low market cap stock that has nobody trading on it. It needs to have an active market. 

Look for "Average Volume > 25M" minimum in my view for this to work consistently.

I’m really hoping we gap up on spy Monday so I can take all my profit and throw it into SPCE weeklies and become rich

Realized gains are offset by realized losses. So if these were all realized he wouldn't have to pay any taxes and could offset any other income with the additional loss.
Total insanity
when you say redeem, do you mean just sell like a normal stock? Is there anything special I'd have to do to redeem for that specific price?
tldr; so dumb it’s hilarious. It’s like an editor read bloomberg’s coverage of WSB and felt they needed to hop on the train so they gave $100 to a reporter to blow out their account. They should have interviewed a user from random instead 😂

Dude you went from 4k to 80k how tf is this a mess up! Lmfao what, what is ur income like? If it is under 40k u pay 12% on short term gains if it is over 60 I think 22% but that is with stock gains combined. Just pay 30% in taxes wtf u still beat us all lmao it just came fast

This is because it's most likely because a laziness error. Their code probably just searches for 1/15/21$140C numbers through all data and put it on a chart, so it used both the $140 pre and post split numbers. It's why the $136 doesn't exist.

Like I said, this contract definitely existed at the price he says he bought it at. Whether he actually did or not is up to people to believe or not.

In the U.K. we have what’s called a Stocks and Shares ISA. You can put £20k into it per year, and everything inside the account, including any gains you make, are completely tax free. It’s basically a ring fenced tax free trading account.
I’m hoping for a pullback so I can buy more. I’m in at $127 and stupidly sold half at $152 because “this thing isn’t going anywhere in the next few months”.

I'm saying you don't know if they are hiring a less qualified person or not, you don't know who they are hiring. In any case, their hiring practices do not seem to be impeding the companies growth so what's the issue? Just because the are diversifying doesn't necessarily mean they are hiring less qualified individuals just because, for all you know they are now hiring even more qualified people

How did you turn $500 to $1 million?
Depends on your outlook for the stock.  I love Tesla and think they will be trillion+ market cap company in the future.  But I was also expecting current price/market cap around 2024-2025.  So the stock is about 3-4 years ahead of my price target.  I think S&P inclusion will be short term top for TSLA shares so I plan to sell all my shares and options on Dec 18th right before the market close.  I will pay the short term and long term capital gains taxes and look to buyback TSLA shares in the future at cheaper prices.  I could be wrong and TSLA could continue its climb into 2021 leaving me behind.  But I'm ok with that because TSLA made me multimillionaire, and I don't need to get rich twice.  I can play the wheel and theta gang and generate plenty of monthly income by selling options and never have to work again.

lol, there are hundreds of banned tickets.
Because that's when the option split, so that option didn't exist (specifically $136 pre split) before sept 2020. 

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/option-chain/call-put-options/tsla--210115c00070000](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/option-chain/call-put-options/tsla--210115c00070000)

If you look at the $70C for the same expiration date, it was valued at $1400+ before sept because TSLA was $1500+ before the split and a $70C had data prior to this because it's in multiples of 5 so this strike (pre split) was possible. A $136 strike wasn't possible pre split.

After the split, you see it plummet down to around $350 because TSLA was about $350 post split.
That flair tho

If you have cash in your account, it makes sense if you time it right. Say you bought 100 XYZ at 20 and sold $30c 10dte for $125. Its now 4dte, XYZ is at 28 and rising, you're pretty sure it's going to blow by 30.

You could either buy your call back for like $400 (wild ass guess), or buy another 100 shares of XYZ for 2800 and let those first hundred shares get called away at 30 for a $1000 profit and sell a 40c against the next 100 shares (if you think the top is 40).

It depends where you think the stock is going, but if you are confident it's going to moon, either buy calls or leaps, it doesn't make sense to wheel a stock that's mooning.
Great post on CRM, but you cannot write this without mentioning its' retard little brother #SNOW. The VC bros, Buffet, and CRM are all laughing their asses getting in on this infinite bagger pre-ipo at $120 or less. This company is going to $200 bil in 3 years.

Currently sitting on 400 shares of SNOW and have made $32k. Hedged this week with some puts expiring this coming Friday.

Also Long CRM 100 shares but am down $2.5K after the drop you mentioned.

 its going to be a spectacular let down, all the good companies rejected his ass

The other thing people don’t realize is that forex is 100% guesses, there is no magic formula that can help you track within any amount of comfort for me.

I keep seeing people on my Facebook joining these groups claiming to have algos... sure
to a point.. but at least with stocks you have tangible info you can research before making your bets.

Forex is all smoke and mirrors.
I found a drug better that normal options you kids ever heard of **60 second binary options**? Heard you make 100% or nothing within 60 seconds.
Yea that's the date (it's like year/month/date so for you 09/30/20). Then the days you were banned. And the number of violations.

Every stock has a fixed upside in a given time, it only raises so far, the whole point of a spread is if you know exactly how high the stock is going to rise, you don't have to waste money on the part of the stock price the stock will never reach.

You just have to be autist enough to know exactly when and how high the stocks going to go, it's the only way to maximize the tendons.

Eh, if they use that shit in the gvt to build a tracking system that can retrace on a personal level your actions, that'd be arguably evil. If used wrongly. Which it will be, of course. There's an interesting post on wsb somewhere where a security specialist (or sth like that) explains it. 

On the other hand, as if every other big tech giant (Zuck, Google, Apple, Nvidia, and so on) isn't looking to exploit (personal) data of their users to maximize profits.

Last night the cops arrested 20ish high schoolers who met up to drink in my apartment parking lot. 

At first I was disappointed that not even a single person tried to outrun two fat ass cops when there were woods 10 feet away. They just knelt down and put their hands up.

Then I remembered MIPs are only a civil fine now so not worth getting a felony evasion for. Duh.

Kinda sad tho, the stupid shit that used be part of our youth is no more. 

Still, I did see one guy who must have been taking a piss in the bushes or something when the cops rolled up sneak out past them and run down Main Street when they weren’t looking.

It's considered polite to reciprocate.
I definitely agree with you. But what I’m explaining is to not sell the stock at all so you aren’t taxed. Only sell  the amount of options to purchase the shares from the options you exercise. You then get a financial advisor at one of the major shops where they give you favorable interest rates terms to borrow against your stock. 

You can then use what you pay in interest to offset income for that particular year. 

Essentially, you are delaying as long as possible to pay Uncle Sam and that’s what the ultra wealthy do.

You may have answered this already, but thinking about this from the other side: wouldn’t the institutions know of the squeeze already and figure out ways to mitigate any further losses by either covering sooner or any other action, outside of doubling down on their position and hoping it doesn’t go full blown squeeze? Or is there something I’m missing? Thanks again sir

As he zips up his pants, you reach for the car door. “Wait.” You turn back to him. He hesitates. “...Why do you do this?”

You laugh. “For the money.” You pull the two twenty dollar bills he handed you earlier out of the breast pocket of your flannel shirt. You always wear flannel. You’ve found these sad, overweight husbands like a rugged look. They don’t know you’re a soft city kid. Well, they know your hands are soft.

“No. Why do you need the money?” You didn’t anticipate this question. He presses. “Are you homeless? Hungry?”

You laugh him off. “No, I have a gambling problem.” He sighs, “Oh. Cards? Poker?”

You open the car door. “Yeah, something like that.” But you don’t do this for card hands. You trade handies for weeklies.

The year is 2030, spx is at 20,000. Long calls have proven the most successful trade for the last decade, wsb becomes the largest investment group in the world as their gains have outpaced hedge funds and others who manage risk by 100-1. In the year 2025 wsb pulled their power together and nominated those with the most gains to become the defacto faces of the sub, our combined ownership of the stock market made us majority shareholders of most companies with our delegates now holding board positions. 

Earnings calls are now held through AMA's on wsb, companies figured they'd atleast try to get their majority investors to learn about what they do as a company this way. "xXTendyMaster69420Xx" poses the question on AAPLs Q4 2030 results AMA  "if Tim cook gay? That mean he bear? Bear go down, buy put??". As the largest shareholder of apple with over 100million% gains in calls since 2020, whatever xXTendyMaster69420Xx decides to do, controls the future of the company. Goldman and jpm try to control the situation, trying to convince him bulls are the gay ones, but it doesn't work, he just keeps replying "bear r gay! bear r fuk!". Finally he edits his initial comment "dog shitted on right side of lawn, apple go down" and just like that apple falls 80% as wsb sells all their apple holdings.

 Luckily, apple was only the tenth largest company in the market behind the likes of SPCE, TSLA, DKNG, GME, and other stonks (official renaming of stocks to stonks happened in 2028 after "ThetaGAYng" was elected president, shortly after he declared Citron a terrorist organization). The market fell, but the dip was bought like usual. for the next six years ThetaGAYng created the greatest bull run in American history through policies leading economic experts have called "truly fucking retarded" and "the worst ideas I've ever heard". As SPX reaches 400,000 by the end of his two terms. 

This is how I see the market playing out.
Right? I come here for the free drinks not the advice. I’ll hit on 17 if I damn well feel like it.

I don't remember how high the strikes went up to.  I bought $300 and $420 1/15/21 call options back in Sept 2019 when TSLA was trading around $240 presplit.  I paid $39.50 for the $300 call and $12 for the $420 call.  I think there were $600+ strikes, but I don't remember exactly as I dismissed it because I didn't think those were realistic targets.  Even the $420 I bought as a joke.


But he claim he bought in summer time.  I don't know if $600+ strikes existed back then.  I only know from Sept 2019 when I bought my calls.
I’m selling 3 covered calls for $22 Dec 11. Someone is paying me $300 in premiums for this.

I hope you are right... it just seems like this last earnings season that 99% of the stocks immediately tanked and then recovered within the next day or two. This happened even with blowout earnings, which everyone knows GME will not post. 

Either way, GME will go back up and recover if it does dip.

GME easily gonna print. They have an entrepreneurial genius whose about to take over a completely depressed balance sheet. Kid has done this before in an industry with an open slot for this exact business. I only ask a little patience from you.
only way that would happen is if he said he was conceding lol
Exactly what I was thinking.  To much potential good news hiding the deep cracks in the economy.  Stemi pump, vaccine, green new deal type pump.  I think it dumps once these come and recovery still does not pick up its pace.  To much letting us pretend that the economy can come up to meet current market prices.  Once that does not happen at speed, collecting profit on a price that will no be justified for many year will look to good not to dump into.

RKT to $30 by when?
But you call a 1 month dip a crash?
What is?
I would avoid BABA personally. It's too unstable and uncertain how people will react en mass. You have better options.

GME is also another I would avoid. The IVR is so bad that if you're using options it just doesn't look like it'll pay. This was a play that you had to make in August. It just was.

Lol honestly, you are probably right.... but I Just yolod into vxx calls expiring next week so that's why I'm hoping we tank, at least monday
So you pay $1 for the 349P/348P debit spreads (in order to get filled), then hope for a 5-7% correction so those become worth maybe $20 apiece? Interesting... I'm not sure what could cause such a crash though after everything that's been thrown at the market this year.

They should be releasing earnings sometime this month.  The ceo says they should be profitable by 2022 and their revenues have been increasing substantially.  

I'm invested in the company but it's hard to tell how it will pan out in the next five years.  The proprietary software they obtained from ppsi, who also supplies parts etc. for them, entitles them to a five year non complete cause with ppsi.  During that time, ppsi will supply them with nick nacks at no more than a small mark up for clsk.  

PPSI also just settled al lawsuit with myers power inc. which I think involved this software possibly or some info that cleanspark was entitled to that ppsi was being sued over.  

Cleanspark was indemnified from any judgement in this case but it still seems relevant, ppsi being there main supplier of parts.

I think their last acquisition was Grid fabric.. Whatever it was, I sort of thought the sofware, switchgear they had already did that.  

If you read this far, you've realized idk what i'm talking about.  Long story short, i like the story but the details kind of leave me wanting more.

If any one has a clearer understanding of clsk ppsi tsla relationship pony up.

Lastly, it seems most of the contracts they have in the US are under some sort of non disclose agreement.  This seems odd to me.  Perhaps it was related to the lawsuit or some agreement with ppsi.  I don't see Tesla for instance ever disclosing that clsk's switchgear and software plays any role in their megapacks.  CLSK was probably paid to give up their right of disclosure.

price 2023 ?
I'm thinking at $100.  My cost basis was $6.2 and the $100 are around there, so I guess worse case would be around break even if the underlying tanks?  I've never actually opened a spread, but assume if I have 6 contracts of calls I can sell 6 above?
It’s fake

They treat both sides as valid, when in fact, one side is total fucking bullshit, has zero proof, and relies on youtube conspiracy videos for their evidence.

Is this the start of a new bull run? With oil on the rise, corporate debt recovering and rise in cash reserves via printing of money - it feels shaky sure, but I think this is the time to be in the market

What planet are you on? They rolled out the full self driving beta like a month ago. Tesla is changing an entire industry. Using your examples amazon did completely change an industry and there stock sky rocketed. Now they have competition from Walmart among others. Google also has completion. Tesla's competors are 5 or 6 years behind at the very least. That means they have that much time to build a customer base, brand loyalty ect. A good example is apple with the iphone. Yeah Google has pretty much caught up but being as late as they were cost them tons of market share. I do think Tesla is over valued but not nearly to the degree you are claiming.
Not a simp. But actually see #4 on the list gotta get shit done
Look up what brokers in your country offer stupid leverage. I used AAFX.

not really though. Price trends in most currencies pairs are actually pretty steady and have manageable volatility over a long period. Also volume is really high so one actor can't really influence the price unless it's someone like the Fed. You can make good money with FOREX if you start with a good chunk of money and are patient. You just need to manage your risk and don't be tempted to use ridiculous amounts of leverage. So don't expect to turn $1000 into $100k or yearly returns of 100%. Aim for a realistic 10 year average yearly return of something like 20%. Anything higher than that is just gambling.

It is simple. Your main fault is going to be choosing and sticking to a strategy. That is by far the hardest part; the math is ugly, a.k.a. Continuous Time Finance with Merton, but you don't really need it if you're small and aren't building an algorithm. You need a very, very basic understanding of the Greeks and fundamentally the two that are most important are Gamm and Vega in my opinion; others use Delta and Theta as their trade bases. But you just ... pick a strategy.

I think conditions are rising for a 1.04 10yr bond yield which would set into place the perfect conditions for a huge collapse and vix would be below 15 before the start of it. 12/23 start, 12/24 black Christmas, and a restart when 10 yr bond yields are at .65(probably a 20% crash, but gold might go up/gold dropped last crash so buyer beware). Cyclicals are a short term buy but should be trimmed a few days before Tesla inclusion into the s and p
CCL has diluted the shares not too long ago so be aware of that.  No cruise for a while so I think leaps or shares would be a better play than short term plays.

I only swing trade anal. In, out, in, out
I didn't receive any cash from the government here in Canada, no. And I got caught by the March covid crash holding tons of air-travel related stock (with plenty of margin) and call options. Forced liquidation of most of my holdings on a margin call at the bottom, and had to sell off a lot of now hopelessly out of the money, near-worthless calls I had (which had been nicely in the money a month or two earlier). Was a worst-case scenario event for my portfolio.

In my experience, brokers that offer that much leverage have **massive** spreads. So they make money there. 

Also, having so much leverage encourages over trading. It’s the “Well if my $1000 is controlling $2mil in a position, there’s no way I can lose!” This is followed by an immediate loss from the spread, which wipes out most of the account, and then they think, “Well surely Ill make it back with my next trade!” 

Then there’s also the fact that if an account goes negative, the account owner needs to pay back the amount they’re negative (with most brokers). So now they’re in debt to the broker and need to pay them.

If that makes sense.
They cut the stock to give dividends for some reason, a lot of commentary that people are just gonna reinvest that money and drive the share price back to where it was beforehand. Check the chart over the last week
Naa one in Austin Texas.
Pretty cool stuff
7/26/19 buy date, so a 15 month to expiration at 3x current price (TSLA was $228 on that day). I thought the same thing, that a 15 month to expiration means a fuck ton of theta, but because strike is at 3X spot, it don't matter. Here's the price on that day.

Coiling can break downwards too, no?
Agreed. And good description.

You do have to consider the opportunity cost of the capital required though. That and the added risk of the larger premiums of your naked call options (LEAPs). That said, these also often are stable large cap maybe dividend bearing stocks with relatively little risk of rapidly decreasing substantially in value. And like you say, it’s just a waiting game. Of course, at a certain point you might as well just buy shares.

I look for bart simpson historical charts. That, to me, means that IV is going up and down constantly because the stock is strong and actively traded between bears and bulls. Buy low sell high but with IV so you leverage way more profits

What's great about this, is it works with OTM options too, so you can pay very little and practice with $10 investments, work your way up slowly as you build confidence and understand what you're doing and what you're looking for, when to enter and when to exit these trades.

If you tards buy shares in a margin account you are not reducing the available float and you are making more shares available to the shorts sellers.  You have to buy shares in a cash account or else contact your broker and tell them not to lend your shares.

Agree regarding US auditors but what happens if China client falsifies docs & US auditor says "well the we can't be expected to find every fraud" & "we were victims of the fraud also". For context see Citi 2008 & CDOs. US gov't didn't hold those US bank CEOs accountable for financial "missteps", I doubt US gov't will hold China orgs responsible/ accountable for any issues .  Thus regulating/auditing China orgs listed in US is not reassuring enough for me to invest in CN stocks - I will trade them but not long term invest

If he exercises, he won't pay tax but the shares become short-term again.  So he would have to hold those shares for another 12 months before he sells if he wants LTCG.  If he's planning to sell in the next 12 months, it's way better for him to sell the option and pay the 20% LTCG tax now.

Tell them you are not a financial advisor but a autistic degenerate scum that has accomplished to make money and anything you say should be considered gambling. Then you cant be blamed. Good job on the gains though.
If I have the chance to spin the rumor harder, here it is: SPY is buying them out for $200 pps.

In all seriousness, some bullshit investment firm put something out saying that CSCO was speculated to buy them for $130 pps. Mixed with technicals looking up, this was just a bs catalyst to initiate a huge gap fill. I’ll be sweating around the 120 price point. Last 2 times it sold off hard as fuck

If NIO dips to 33, what call price would you put in and what timeframe for it?
Yes any increase in the underlying is potential IV profit, even 10% increase can be worth 300% or more premium increase, which if you sell at that price would give you 300% return on investment.

If you pay $0.09 per contract and buy 100 contracts, that costs you $900 up front

Stock moves up $4 within the year at some point... IV has spiked... premium is selling at $0.27 per contract, that is 300% increase in premium value, you sell your contract and take $2700.... so you turned $900 into $2700 within 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, or some time frame between now and the expiry of the LEAPS contract. 

You're just waiting to be correct, if the stock pick eventually goes up at any point you have the potential to sell for profit at higher premium than you paid.

Nok. Big ass float. 2023 calls. They are at a pivotal point atm. Of they bring their line of everything to the US, and expand their line, they can be some serious competition with Samsung. Otherwise its just the cheapest 5g play there is. Nokia has alot going for it imo it is undervalued. Shares under 3.90 are a good buy 2023 calls under 70 are also a good buy.

Sure.

I undertand they can buy other contracts, or the underlying itself.

So I agree.

I will rephrase.  This contract does have a loss for someone.  It is also possible they bought other contracts or the underlying to offset the loss so that their total loss is not the total of this contract itself.
Probably weeklies to gain profit and then use those profits to option again doubling, quadrupling, and so forth. It works on stocks you know that literally only go up in a short span of time but it's also the riskiest if they drop.

I was questioning TD Ameritrade as to why they would think it is a good idea to make it a requirement to leverage a forex account. Especially if they know most traders don't succeed. They had no answer. 

Most forex brokers dont work with us citizens because us govt has made it extremely difficult and pricy to do business here. I've looked into other forex brokers with great reviews who dont use leverage and they dont do business with us citizens. This is supposed to be the land of opportunity and freedom to make choices. Except for the Gov has taken away opportunities and restricted our choices. Only really 2 forex brokers we can use here and both require leveraging. Who's making money. Not us

He supposedly invested his gains with some company and they took his money and ran. He's now banned from trading for life and eats at McDonalds.

Can you explain how people have that much leverage available to them?  Is it effectively as if their broker is giving them a massive loan with a minimum of collateral? And what's in it for the broker in allowing crazy amounts of leverage? (Surely it's risky for them too.)

I see, so if I understood correctly, your view is that there's probably more chance the share prices will go up (if discussions of future plans are positive), rather than down even if sales and financials are poor?  

If that's the case, and the poor sales are really priced in, I am inclined to hold my shares. Unfortunately if it drops, since I'ved YOLO'd, I can't buy the dip haha.

From a quick look at the charts, if this thing bounces off of 129 again... OP is going to take a hit like he's never felt before. The titanic will not peak 3 times.
you would have cashed out at 2%
I just googled ANAL and I like what I see.
Example: research a stock you are bullish on, you believe the market has oversold it in the past year (for me, this is Intel).

If any kind of bullish news releases in the next year that causes IV to increase, the underlying doesn't even have to move much, but IV (which is this theoretical value that is constantly fluctuating over time) moves in your favor, then you profit at that point by selling the contract to the bulls who are rallying the stock and driving the premiums up.

It's almost guaranteed money.

If you're wrong and picked a stock that actually is decreasing in value over the course of the LEAP (a contract with greater than 1 year to expiry), then so fucking what? At any point you can sell for a loss (but still recoup a lot of your original premium).

And you have more than one contract, so eventually you're going to be in the green on most of them.

If you can't profit from this then you're really bad at picking stocks and should stop or pay someone to help you.

TLDR look at every good stock, look at IV, find low IV (this usually means premiums will cost less), find indicator of being oversold, look at the greeks, look for high vega, high delta, low theta, contracts with at least 1 year to expiry, buy as close to ITM as you can, but OTM are cheaper and can reduce risk but also profit greatly from these types of IV spikes and spikes in premium as a result, I prefer OTM because cheaper.

I should just give this guy my money and he take a commission off the earnings lol.
Do you really think the whole country is going to all buy EVs in the middle of the biggest recession of our lifetime?
Even if it does rise above the underlying cost it doesn’t increase losses, it just caps gains. You also have to realize stocks don’t rocket as quickly as you think. If you don’t know how to mitigate risk then you shouldn’t be in the casino. If you’re given a 9 and 10 in black jack it would be smart to sit on that hand. You’re screaming, “hit me” at the dealer whenever you buy high IV without considering losses, and the IV could always drop off overnight for no reason. I would say see you at the food bank, but I mitigate my losses while maximizing my gains.
When we roll out the vaccine, are we going to see more autists in this sub? Fuck, I hope so. Get vaxxed, folks. You may get some stimmy tendies with it too!
It works till it doesnt!
>I know for me the hardest thing to overcome is when I'm down for a long time and I feel bad about it then the whole thing goes even, then a little green I sell to get rid of that piece of shit that hurt my feelings for so long. Then of course it goes on to get greener every day because thats how fucking risk works. The bigger the down the bigger the up, over time, if you're not exclusively in FDs.

This is true, however, you have to be trading alot for the CRA to flag you, and you need to be doing it with a hefty balance. If you do plan to do semi frequent trades in a TFSA, it's smart not to withdraw your realized gains. Then they can peg you with trading for income. If you leave it in your account, you can argue that it has been a true savings account.
Selling a put when IV is high means you will collect the premium and possibly pick up more shares at a lower price. The premium you get when you sell it is your protection. And if it doesn't drop, you keep it anyway.
Look at SPY put options for 12/18. OI is insane. Will repeat this post every few hours so that people hedge and don’t get their accounts blown up (could be whales just hedging but idk).

for one, the market is forward looking, how you’re going to do in the future is much more important than how you did in the past. if they offer any sort of guidance, that’s going to be exponentially more impactful than whatever their earnings are.

second, even for the earnings themselves they’re already expected to do bad, so it’s more likely that they either perform as expected or beat expectations, than it is they do worse than expected.

Similar boat to /u/itssallgoodman and /u/OgKingHerc in that I'm trying to get my feet wet as well. 

It sounds like you're anticipating the stock to rebound from ~106 all the way to >110 by Friday (and even if it doesn't get all the way there, you'd sell before expiry anyway) - in any case, do you anticipate the price of the underlying will increase enough to offset the time decay? Seems like the underlying will need to make a big move to create any value on the 110c 12/11, but curious if I'm misunderstanding.
I’ll take 6% in a day any day.
Your "poots" are most definitely gonna be worthless. Simple as that
The reason why options don't exist until Sept 2020 is because that's when the split happens. During a split, all old options are basically removed and replaced with the new option prices. The $140C has data prior to sept 2020 because TSLA was actually low enough (pre split) to have options that low ($140 pre split) and it's in increments of $5, so that might be old data? The $136 doesn't have data because it's not in increments of $5 (again, pre split).

I realized this because tried to do some theory crafting with TSLA options using Fidelity and usually, they show lowest and highest price for these options, but their "lowest" wasn't actually that low, and they all showed that they were generated in Sept 2020, which was the split.

Now, as for the $680C, this DOES exist before Sept 2020 because TSLA hit as high as $800 back in Feb 2020 from everyone on WSB buying into it. In fact, it existed back in 2019 as well. OP says he bought his 1/15/21 680C on 7/26/19 for $1.09 per contract, well, here's the proof that this contract actually existed:

[https://i.imgur.com/uXO0nyf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/uXO0nyf.jpg)

This is ThinkBack on Thinkorswim, you can check historical option prices and I have the date set to 7/26/19, and the 1/15/21 680C did go for $1.09 (x100) per contract.

I thought OP was full of shit too because how the fuck is a contract a year and a half out only cost $1 (x100)? Check it for yourselves if you want.
The fuck
Gme er is gonna break a lot of ppl or print tendies
Right- that strike isn’t feasible so far out.

Yeah, with the volatility now- didn’t have that in summer ‘19- check the charts. Find a stock trading like Tesla was in 2019, tell me the highest range.

Nio is the closest one I think of (still high volatility) and it only goes till 80 2 years out.

463 per share x2000=926,248 which is his gain. Average price is per share not contracts,  he bought them for 463$ which is .023 yes 23 centsx2000=463. Now delete Robinhood, and stop gambling.
👉🏻👌
Exercising for shares resets the clock.  The options are LTCG.  He would be a fool if he exercised if he was planning on selling the shares in the next 12 months.  Way better to sell the options and pay 20% LTCG tax.
honestly, this is really bullish for calls

> They have a floor price of $20 for commons since you can redeem your shares for $20 any time before a merger is complete. So after they announce the target, if the target / valuation is extremely unpopular, the floor price for the shares are still $20 since your shares are backed by actual cash (PSTH holds them in treasuries). However - after the merger is approved by shareholders, then there will no longer be a price floor.
> 
> 

how would you go about redeeming your shares before the merger? If the stock price falls to $18 and you sell, would they automatically sell for $20?
Sweet thanks.  I've thought about getting one of these for a long time as a cool toy.  This might put me over the edge.
Out of curiosity, do you have a reason it will bounce up from here? About 4% down on shares but I can’t buy down any more and at this point I’m just trying to rationalize if I’m losing money that could have gone into an ARK fund on the hopes that CRSR bounces back hard enough that it’s worth waiting.
Blowout earnings? I don't think any of them make money...

This attitude is why Tesla shorts kill themselves
It's been a few different stocks, I just look for the "🚀🌝" emojis and blindly trust WSB.
Yeah, with the volatility now- didn’t have that in summer ‘19- check the charts. Find a stock trading like Tesla was in 2019, tell me the highest range. 

Nio is the closest one I think of (still high volatility) and it only goes till 80 2 years out.

AND he got that many contracts for $500? That’s bullshit. You can’t get those 1300c for $500 now...

It was $50ish when he got it, had been $50ish for 6 years and he bought a 200 leap

Options. Highest risk and highest reward. People could have been millionaires off of palantir alone if they staked options from the beginning until $30. Instead of the 200% normies like myself get, you could collect 2-3k% instead.

can you share your portfolio?
I’m with you completely. I will not seek to replicate this. Many things went perfectly.
I don’t think one person has that contract at that price. I’m saying someone sold to open then someone sense bought that sell to open. 

Down the line, maybe 1000 people bought that initial contract, each person losing along the way.

Initial seller wrote it, lost $10,000, then bought to close. Someone else sold to open, lost $25,000, bought to close.
And he said he bought it at 500 bucks.  He replied to my original comment in his post saying that he liked his position 🤣
Theres some proverb called "we'll see". Its a very short read but worth keeping in mind
Imo nokia is undervalued, but a risky play. They are at the point where they need to bring their line of everything to America. In 2 years I can see them being serious competition with Samsung. Big ass float though.

You can go out two years on TSLA rn and buy 1300... and it is only 600.
Okay guys, 

I am going all in on ANAL. This is the next stonk to go to the moon, if you do not get FD's on ANAL you hate money.
Guess when tsla was trading at its lowest ~180 presplit
The most important thing I've learned is to make sure your fear and greed don't cause overconfidence that causes you to buy positions that can't afford to be patient.
Goodwill capital.
Why do you sound so aggressive? You can see the contracts on thinkorswim if you type .TSLA210115C680
They were trading at a low of $0.39 which is $0.08 split adjusted, well under OPs price

Your language is very harsh and you sound so certain of yourself when in fact you are the one who is wrong. You should maybe reflect on that a bit

Everyday i grow convinced this sub is full of people who press buy without a single flicker of understanding
So help me understand this.  You have 20 contracts that expire 1/15/21.  Each cost $.23 originally and each is now worth $463?   I guess I'm trying to figure out when you bought in and at what rate at the time
CLG is better than TSM

TSM overhyped, i miss Bjerg
Thanks, but realistically it might bounce back to 250 within a few weeks. Shits way way oversold
CVS and WBA three weeks out is absolutely free money
If the short squeeze happens in this time frame you gonna be rich!!
Dude it's 500 bucks. You let that shit ride. Who cares about break even? Not a dumb idea to have a play like this going alongside other smarter trades.
Not sure where you heard that, but they will be part of them. I have my calls set to April because if you look at the graphs of GME stock it has a large increase after console release and than a steady rate of increasing for next month's after

Forgive my ignorance but I'm not savvy on the market... Came here from r/popular. How does this work? I bought 20 shares of TSLA outright in 2011 and while I've certainly made a good amount of money, it's absolutely nowhere near this.

CRM
Because playing stocks that have low IV and typically don't move much as far as underlying (oh no $4 how can I make money from a $4 move?), but have strong support... will eventually move at some point during a LEAPS contract. The odds of the IV increasing are high. IV is always fluctuating in active stocks. 

You just wait, watch, and collect the profit from increased IV with your high Vega contracts.

Bought several leaps out to July with a strike of $250 on thursday
TSLA didn’t have any huge moves forever. Guy literally timed it perfectly. He’s the only person who would’ve held through March too. Truly a special kind of retard.
Anybody. In the US (not European markets) options contracts are exercisable at any time before expiry. They can exercise and hold or exercise and sell the shares for mad profit.
They do. That is why they get lampooned constantly. They have plenty of various ethnicities in their engineering teams... they just have relatively few women. It isn’t a TSLA problem, it is an industry problem. There are just very very few female engineers. SJWs are quick to try and attack them for this, even on their earnings calls, but it just doesn’t matter, because Elon would hire the craziest feminist he could find if she was a 16 hr a day genius engineer. Meritocracy doesn’t care about your dick to non-dick ratio, and it is one of the reasons TSLA rocks
Looking to put a few k into some leaps soon - which are you guys in?
Just find a good API and write a little bit of Python or something.
if you are not a white male then you must be retarded?

you learn something new everyday...
well they liquidate it and take the $900 loss and you either quit the game and hide, or you pony up because you know that with another $100 you'll be back out there winning. They would stop loss it and maybe try to stiff you for more. But how many people ever quit the casino the first time they lost big?
better to be a long holder then a caller in this case.
What a great fucking idea.  I’m gonna see what it takes to whip these up from scratch.

Not directly related to profit/revenue, but Nvidia's market cap is bigger than Intel's market cap
2035 shares checking in! More after earnings just in case a dip happens from some paper boiz delivering some shit tier profits to their accounts early.
Algos will buy the option, exercise, and sell the shares.  Bid/ask spread is wide on deep ITM options but there's always buyer at the bid since they can make money on the arbitrage.  I have deep ITM TSLA call option as well that I plan to sell right before the S&P inclusion.  I will sell the option at a discount and not exercise because the call option is longterm vs if I exercise into shares, the clock resets and the exercised shares become short-term.  So it's worth it for me to sell the option at a discount because 20% LTCG is much better than 37% ordinary income tax.
Idk what this company is but I am in

You can’t.  You need 100 shares at minimum to sell 1 contract.  Buy 70 more shares and then you can sell 1 contract.
On Thursday, I bought GME for 16.07 and on Friday I sold it for 16.6. It peaked at 17.25 and closed at 16.9.

To top it off, I bought back in at 16.8, even though I had a chance to buy it at 16.65. I was thinking I was still gonna be able to buy at the lower price point than I sold it.

Amazon grew by gobbling up market share and establishing massive moats and crazy high customer satisfaction, directly translating to revenue growth. 

But I agree plenty of companies have been revenue only and been pumped to stupidity and the minute they stop producing blowout earnings they drop to shit.
Regarding that Tesla post $500 -> $900k+:

There’s no way you could get such a high strike almost a year and a half out. Please show me a ticker now that has that kinda range so far out.

If it makes you squint and sniff- it’s probably bullshit

He still thinks he’s right which is fucking hilarious, go read our comments funny as shit
They send you a statement but not until after the year ends. If you're trying to harvest losses before the end of the year, you have to go through manually.
looking for some meme options for this week what are we getting rich off of??
Thank you for your service
You are so right. Most of the millionaires I know are such because they rebelled against the lazy or mediocre financial efforts of their parents. Just like many of the millionaire's kids will rebel against their parent's excessive work ethic and not put in the effort to acquire wealth. Blaming "generational wealth" for your low level of assets is a cop out.

How was the premium for TSLA leaps so cheap?
All good.  Enjoy your youth however you can.

How exactly is PLTR helping with vaccinations? Isn’t it just a magic orb or something?
Sooo I own 500 shares of NIO at 47 average. I thought that was a decent average considering the analyst prediction on NIO. If this downtrend continues do you expect NIO to hit the bottom and trade sideways? 

Or is the expectation that it will bounce back up fairly quickly. I am long on NIO, just want to temper my expectations to ensure I don’t impulsively panic sell. 

Also anything you suggest to hedge my losses in the meantime? But more at the bottom and average down? Or just wait it out?
3x my account value and got out with stop losses, I remember raving about how we all need to buy at 25 cause it’s going to moon to 30 and then waking up not even a half week later to a stop loss activating it around $47 shit was fucking insane every day was a 10% gain for about 10 days

What could be the next Amazon, or Facebook, or Netflix? Feel like anyone entering the market in 2014 or later hasn’t gotten a company like one of those to invest in at the ipo.
probably won’t be much of a drop at all, it’s more likely to just go up

Can't lose more than $520 but if you hold till expiry and the stock closes at $29.99 that day, you lose 100% of your initial investment as opposed to the 0.03% you would lose if you had bought shares. 

So, yep, high (though limited, as long as you only buy options and don't start selling to open them without fully understand how they work) risk, high reward.

JD is looking great in a long-term channel but could also be signaling a pattern within that channel. **Disclaimer**: this is a potential pattern, not a fully realized one — it still needs to prove out, but it’s worth watching.

Chart here [https://imgur.com/a/oyhacPC](https://imgur.com/a/oyhacPC)

You’ll see JD ran up Aug 17th through Sep 2nd, with a very clean run of about +20%. Prior to the run, it ran up nearly to the top of the channel and then chopped its way to the bottom of the channel. After sitting there for about a week, it started to run.

The same pattern is evolving right now which, if it mirrors the first move pretty closely, would mean JD starts its run-up this week. Yes, this is a little bit of crystal ball territory, but it jumped out at me on the chart, and wanted to share — do with it what you will!

Given the timing involved, this would be best played as a swing trade if it plays out. Other factors to note are:

\+ Is consolidating near the bottom of the channel currently

\+ Has been holding the same channel since January

\+ Has been in an upturned that entire time

\+ Recently hit a double bottom

\+ RSI at 49

\+ Analyst target of $99.11 ▲ (16.12% Upside)

\- Slight downtrend on the MACD

&#x200B;

edit: this is the daily chart
How does this work? You didn’t just buy stocks right? What are you doing to make those profits on stocks in general? It’s not just simple buying/selling right?

The screenshot is from a presentation they gave
I would look at GameStop's Dec 8 earnings first, and if they have further plans to expand into digital sales.  Depending on what happens after that, I might buy more if the price rises slightly, and will definitely buy more if it dips.  If the price goes up dramatically, then I'll just keep holding.
Musk has been hyping fully self driving for a couple of years now, but there is still no steak with the sizzle. 

If you think an 1,100 PE is reasonable, why isn't Google trading at $500,000/share? Or Amazon at $350,000/share? I mean, for as cool as Tesla is, Google's technology is massively better from a commercial standpoint. Their ecosystem is so good it can basically read your mind.

Me taking the SAT 5 years ago plugging in random values from a problem into the one formula I remember and hoping to get the right answer
I agree with the sentiment of OP that this could be a nice position. I chose 110c 12/11 personally because it has the most volume compared to the more ITM strikes on the weeklies. I meant when I said I didn’t like the volume that I didn’t like the the low volume and wide bid ask spread on the one OP suggested, even though it was safer as it has more time and is ITM. The 110c 12/11 has a volume of 945 and OI of 772 Compared to OP’s 105 12/22/21 volume of 58 and OI of 28. Albeit that 945 volume is a little low for me, I’m taking the risk as my position sizing won’t be that big. Just different strategies, I don’t like paying for more time usually as I don’t usually hold a position for longer than a few hours.
I mean, I am jealous of people who hit big lotteries as well. 

The difference is that these don't feel like lottery tickets because they have the veneer of "investment" on top of them.
MSO’s like Trulieve, Curaleaf, Green Thumb and Cresco keep making new highs. And it’s still inning number one. Also their support stocks like GRWG have really been staircasing upward for weeks now. This is the way ✅💰💰💰🎅🏻

That only applies versus the underlying stock at a similar makeup and IV to the SPY or other index you just hold, which you don't do either of when you sell premium. It's a common mistake and it's apples vs. chickens.

I sold Tesla STOCK at $560ish after buying it at $500 (before the split). If I didn't sell it then, I would have sold it at $600, $700, $800, and ESPECIALLY when it passed it's previous all-time high (which I think was $900ish before the pandemic). 

This is why I'm poor. "Scared money don't make no money."
i heard lock up ends dec 16 when 25% of shares or smth can then be sold, maybe it will stay up until then so the insiders can sell to retail investors?

I agree markets are capable of going either way.

I believe LEAPS provide some protection against that, because I believe we're not going to crash or at least we would recover before 2022, in my view, as far as the stock markets are concerned. 

If 2020 wasn't enough to slow down the stock markets, then 2021 can't either. If anything, catastrophe is good for profits.
Stonks definitely go up when dollar goes down, and vice versa.

For some reason, I don't believe those gains on Tesla in front page and several other gains posted over the year. Part of me thinks Robinhood for the past 5 years used this sub as a marketing tool. They could easily retro post gains on app based on purchase contracts bought at a certain date before Tesla split etc. Always be sceptic of what you read on internet. Who doesn't cash out after 100K or 200K profits?
Yeah that is shit you quit worrying about once you hit college age or so.

Jesus fucking Christ. A million autists will see this post, then proceed to lose every cent they have.
Yeah. Deeper OTM contracts provide much greater leverage when theres a big price swing. If I was making a naked call option bet like op, that would be the way to go. The only time I buy close to the money calls is for debit spreads or if I plan to sell PMCCs against it. It just doesn't make sense to buy close to the money. The whole point of buying naked options to me is to give unlimited upside risk with lower downside risk than just buying shares. I'd rather just go deep out and let it ride. If I'm right I get massive returns like op. If I'm wrong I lose a smaller amount of money than someone who bought atm.
Plus, we are here for.all that hot, white suburban anal action. Ooohhh, i luv it.

there's little evidence that selling covered calls is better than simply holding.

This is what I do with my downtime, drive around town forever looking for the next tallest building.
Counter: could go down though
Ty this is fantastic advice. Since I'm not looking at significant losses because I didn't spend a ton of my portfolio, my strategy is basically to go off the intuition that the prices of x underlying values will increase sufficiently for me to make a profit early in the week; if that doesn't happen before like Tuesday I am boned insofar as these contracts are concerned though. Also, having looked into covered calls further as a result of your comment, they seem far safer assuming the underlying value of the contract doesn't rise above the break-even point for exercising the option, and I am not convinced that writing covered call options after a week of a sideways market ending in a sudden upward movement on Friday is the best move. Could be wrong, we will see.

Failure to meet their goals for consecutive years after not raising them again is not the only reason to worry about their valuation. Losing their edge on their competition and losing market share is a big reason to worry about their 1000+ P/E. Poor leadership and the inability to deliver on any promises to their investors is a big reason as well.

Positions: TSLA shares bought pre-split at 700 (everyone called me retarded).  1000 shares of PLTR on opening day, by the time I hit buy it was $10.65 (was in a gay work meeting and missed the first hour), doesn't even ever show that high when I look back... weird as fuck.  Bought around 300 more on the way up Avg cost $12.95. Diamond hands till the day after Thanksgiving when I got drunk/scared and sold.  Other long term holds that contributed, MSFT (gay boomer shit), CRM, WM, QQQ, TQQQ.

I would sell the minimum options to purchase the exercised shares and pay the taxes on those options sold to avoid as much taxes as possible. You probably only need to sell one option to get enough money to pay taxes on that option and to pay to exercise the rest of the options.

That is true, but the percentage gain is so insane on this one precisely because it is super high delta and is so deep in the money now.
I'm not am investor. I would be bearish in the long-term as they will go broke. But the long-term is a long way away. In the shorter term their stock price will be affected more by sentiment than fundamentals. i.e. before they explode the price could go up more than people expect.

I was looking at them last week as they look like they have been oversold... but I think they look like they go down further in the next quarter. Probably another dose of bad news about 10nm yields and 7nm delays.

Don't know - I wouldn't short their stock today but I wouldn't invest it in either. Too many unknowns about their current position in the short term.

A lot of brokerages auto-buy 100 shares to cover any call position that is opened. Depends on which one but usually buying a cheap call is actually conducive to even more buying pressure. Robinhood fish can easily afford deep OTM calls for under $100 but not 100 shares, thus their buying pressure is magnified.

@INSPECTOR ANAL
wholesome.

but ANAL GoDs are HOLE-SOME
The more OTM the option, the more challenging it is to break even. I purchased the 250 call and immediately got rid of it after the first initial movement Wednesday morning. 

Yes the 240 calls are worth it, because despite being more expensive, we don’t need as much movement in the stock for them to gain value. It’s why despite moving upwards fairly well the 12/18 calls are still losing money, they’re too far out of the money to gain value yet. Sure they could gain value, but it’s a much bigger bet. 

Either way you should never be looking for real value in these options, take the gain and get out after your first decent day.
Yes. Doing some of that too. I have 85 deep itm options expiring next year so will exercise those.

Also, I tried uBlock but had a negative experience with it so I just stick to what’s worked for me for years. I want to be clear though, if it works good for you and others then keep running it. I don’t want to seem like I’m pushing any brands. 

(I tried uBlock after multiple people recommended it to me like you did😂)
read his posts, he spent $460 for those returns, so he spent $23 per contract not shares
*Spoiler alert: new Mandalorian epi
Could also convert to spreads by selling calls at the $95 or $100 strike for same date.
had me at $CRM lost me with your call stupids
AND MY ANAL! 🪓
Shares popped 69%
Can you sum that up into one sentence...
He literally said he spent 500$, please stop buying options lmao
Wondering why they weren't already denied if not true
The other dude made me think of this but on BBC the other day (first mistake watching euro poor television, second mistake anything involving the acronym BBC) they had some African Chief on who was pounding the desk saying Africa deserved the vaccine just as much as the US and Britain


Uhhhhh yeah in a perfect world but did your taxes subsidize vaccine development? No bro sit tf down until I get this injection.
at my nearest walmart they closed one of the entrances so people had to funnel in and out of the same door (genius), i'm assuming so they could count and keep track of the number of people in and out, but i don't think they ever limited the number of people inside so it was just pointless

publix though did a good job of one in one out plus had both entrances open and all that shit shout out to publix
If she’s hesitant, this is what you do. Give her head a few times while fingering her and then add a finger that plays around her other hole. She’ll more than likely enjoy it over time and start adding more until you can go balls deep

Haha you are self professed cash gang so yeah that’s your main portfolio, congrats

I’m amazed it’s too hard for you to do share price * number of shares * stock split ratio = $$$

I can send a new screenshot when I get home. Until then you can focus on putting 20,000 * $50 * 2 in your calculator. It’s much larger than your entire portfolio lulz

What are options? I do forex trading and after reading so many comments in this post i want to know what options are
Or maybe a bussy buddy
Here kind sir
Is there really such thing as an “entry level Porsche” if the minimum price is like 60k+
Another great round-up for the week ahead. Thanks!
Dont worry youll get iv crushed and get the losses you so desperately  want on monday. Jk, itll balance out,  hope your option has time on it cuz if so you'll prolly make a lil money in a couple weeks

ya I still don’t get the loss side if the strike price is not exercised
holy fuck you're a stupid fuck. he bought 20 contracts for $23 so he spent $460 on those contracts. these are not for shares u fuck. don't try to sound smart you stupid fuck.
Trying to determine what I should do with my 1/15/2021 90s that are up 50%.  Maybe just sell 5 of the 6 and gambol

No not at all, it just doesn't make sense in the context of the conversation. It just came out of left field and is pretty odd. Like why bring it up at all? Nothing was even close to referencing masks before in the conversation and that comparison adds nothing. It's just odd. No need to get defensive over the topic

This is the most retarded argument against them though. Legit or not, recording a course and then selling it to 1000 people for $500 each, takes barely any work after the filming is done. Why the fuck would you not create an extra super easy income stream, just because you have one already? 

Thats like saying "why would anyone try to make money on the stock market if they already are successfull at working at McDonalds"
@ANALKAREN
This is amazing. Congrats.

Also, RIP to the weekend for all of WSB. There's gonna be a million retards searching for deep OTM lottos to pick (before dropping $500 into 1000C GME for Jan 23)
This is an incredible post. Can’t believe I’m just hearing about this. Thanks a ton for pulling this all together. Got a lot in $GME right now but think some OTM ‘21 calls to start here. Definitely think it makes sense to move a lot of my IRAs into this. Many thanks for the excellent DD.

The beauty is that we will hit the next earnings report in 2021 before these expire.  That will be when the full affect of the new consoles will show up.  So even if the squeeze doesn't happe  this month by all accounts it should happe  by next earnings report.   APRIL CALLS are as safe a bet as you can make at this point.
How many pump threads can you guys put out in one day?

It's a big red FLAG that's screaming, bear trap.

Buy 50 10 dollar or less spy calls or puts and pray for bug movement. I made 1000 on this weeks spike buying 9 dollar 370 calls for Wednesday.. also, I bought a 700 dollar snowflake call on fri and sold it for 1500 about 10 mins later.. tsla, amzn, and other volatile expensive options move quickly.. just guess the right direction.. or pay half your rent for one month, booooorrriiiiiinnngggg

Depends on buyout rumors. Downsies if rumors are denied. Up or flat if silence. Uppies if rumors are confirmed.
Airbnb is an obvious short imo don't they make zero moneys
God help us all for risking money
I keep saying this; I don't know why people suddenly think because they are planning to transition to an online store, they're going to go up from earnings. I am not even sure GME is the largest sale of this console generation either. All my local EB games got 4-5 consoles. Walmart, bestbuy and other places here were SELLING the console online release day still lol. EB games online wasn't selling any consoles 6 hours after it was on the website for preorders.

Plus, people seem to forget earnings almost always causes a dip. Even when they post slightly above expectations.
Lmao that’s shit freakin stupid. Hired someone base on their talent, not their race. Shit getting ridiculous
This doesnt sound retarded enough to be in this sub.
Walmart limiting no of people in store. Never saw this even when covid was at peak. I am in PA

My gosh that is a funky jam. Thank you friend
If you excercise some of the calls, wouldn't you keep the profits as unrealized? All you did is pay like $100 to buy at price x and then you do exactly that without selling anything.
🐻💕
I’ll try.  Not a professional or lawyer, FYI.

I’ve read some filings.  I’ve seen at least one or more spac warrant setups where cashless exercise will limit stock received to a specific ratio, ( example of like .38 shares per warrant) .  The top end comes into play once the stock is over a certain price.   Once trading is over that price, the rate of change of value of net capital invested in shares vs invested in warrants is theoretically identical.

Then the following few days will be fluctuations downward until after about a week we see a consistent uptrend and eventually a month later back past ath.

I met a guy at a party a couple weeks ago (not in the USA, no rona) and he said he traded FOREX. I mentioned about options trading and he stated he did not know what that was, or what options were. smh. Poor bastard.
I have a feeling this will be like reality and it is the thought of doing ANAL is better than the actual thing. Like, yeah it's cool, but it's not as great as you think it is going to be and you end up with sh*t on your dick.

I'll take a flair though please.

Yo what’s her @ let the boys see
Exactly. Even if you bought at $19.42, the 52-week high, it’s looking like you’re gonna make some profit from now till April. If it gets to $20 that’s 3% in less than 6 months, better than half of r/investing lmao
If he excericses, can he continue to sit on the unrealized profits and not pay taxes because technically he didn't realize any gain?
If I were you I would probably Take.  Some.  Profits.

Sorry to say my guy but even though your (supposed) shares are still worth less than my cash account, but the real tragedy here will be when ABNB will price the IPO at the bottom of the range, signaling weakness to the market, and it will trade down at open. Investors and market are ruthless and smell blood. I know it hurts to hear since your entire networth is tied up here, and sorry bruh, but RIP to whatever shares you actually do own.

Short question. I am looking into LEAPS for BABA exp. 01 / 23  @ 220 c. I am quite new to options and expect IV to drop over the next months. Therefore the ITM call reduces Vega quite considerably. Is this sensible overall?
Mostly got out in time, left with 9 shares hanging at $48 lol ...such great products though I'm def keeping an eye on CRSR
If you think market gonna crash, look at M1 money supply since the last dip. Fed won’t let anything happen right now during this wave. As long as people’s 401K is going up, they won’t panic over the virus.
The average cost is price per share, not contract, options are a bundle of 100 shares, the  average cost  is showing you per share. It’s 23 cents per sharex100. Pretty simple math actually
Thats what I'm thinking. Growing market share. Growing market and no competition for intel until 2022 or 2023
You don’t “match” on that app, you can message anyone you want

Awesome response! Thank you. Makes complete sense. So with that being said why did you mention you wanted to go for the 110c 12/11 expiration play but in the same breath mention you didn’t like the volume? Based on the above wouldn’t you prefer to shy away if there’s less volume(for the reasons above)?
How curious it actually does!

If you aren’t already, you need to be taking to a CPA like yesterday. And not some H&R Block asshole - a real CPA. If you aren’t already, you might accidentally ring up a healthy penalty for not paying estimated taxes and you’re already well into AMT-land as it stands. Your filing for 2020 is gonna be messy.

You aren't gonna be able to interpret the function unless you know distributions and calculus well. 

https://www.macroption.com/black-scholes-formula/#theta

Has the theta function. 

Now the thing is if you take the integral of that function, you get the graph I was describing above which is more intuitive (which is a graph of T vs extrinsic value), as the derivative (slope) of that graph (see below for general shape) is the instantaneous theta described in the formula above. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp

We are assuming that nothing else changes of course. Basically your theta decays much faster as it gets closer to expiration, but you also get more gamma as you get closer to expiration to offset it. Also depends on if it's ITM, ATM, or OTM. Theta/gamma most impacted ATM and the formula above describes that with the distribution within the formula. If you notice there's an N() in that formula.

Oh man, gif idea
Worked there when I was in high school. I will say this: their profit margin is fucking retard high. It costs like net 100 bucks to make the biggest one. They sell for 1500 and more for the cover. 
However, their website fucking sucks, their stores are mainly there for teenagers to hang out in at the mall and try to get to second base, and they don’t pay their store sales people commission. 
Also, I don’t believe they partner with many (if any,) furniture chains. 
They used to sell company shirts for bears 🐻 though . Had “LOVESAC” printed in big letters all over it.
What are the chances the weed bull makes it though the senate? The government needs money bad right now, and this would be the perfect opportunity for them to make a killing on taxing it. It really should be a bipartisan objective

You can pretend otherwise while you work your day job and think back to this conversation when the IPO pops like I said.

Ok. Didn’t realize you were so dense. Yes $100 per contract pre split. Which is $1 per share. And thus $20 per contract post split also known as $0.20 per share. I see  why you are doubting. Can you delete your posts saying In lying. As you can see the contracts are now $463.35 per share which is $46335 per contract. Can you do the math now?

Not neccerarily just one person. The counter party can trade out and on to the next one, who at some point trades out again etc. MMs will also delta hedge, i.e. buy the underlying shares proportional to the delta of the option.

How did you get that price so far out with all the volatility?  There was still a lot of vol in the stock in 2019. The premiums seem way too low to be real.

I was thinking about CRWD puts too because that jump was amazing. Good luck.

With splk and estc growing their cloud businesses rapidly in q3, I think SUMO will double by the end of January coming off of earnings and analyst upgrades. It’s gonna pull a spring/summer fsly
Hit me legend
It’ll definitely fall after earnings imo.
Buy the dip.
I don’t think I understand. Corn prices should follow movie theater demand.

ANAL as we speak!
It only shows up in this sub I take it?
So many ANAL GoD’s in here. I’m so proud.

Also, what’s up Jim

ah that sounds great i'll definitely add it to my list
WSB alone holds a shit ton of shares. I don't think it's boomers.
Why that day in particular?
> If a fixed ratio caps leverage in gains then the appreciation of warrant value tracks stock at 1-1.

Could you elaborate on this? 
Fixed ratio v. non-fixed ratio capping leverage?
Yes I trade options for profits from premiums. I don't hold for long.

OTM options with >3 month expiry on low IV stocks are really producing consistent profits for me. 

They're safe and the slightest market moves make them increase by triple digit percents consistently. Finding companies with these in volume is the tricky part. But once you find a low priced one, it is worth testing.

Spend a small amount on cheap ones and see for yourself. Ofc some will lose. We cant time it always. But bullish sentiment on heavy companies like these at lower underlying prices can really be profitable. I'm watching PLTR also for a drop in IV
It’s based on how much money those under you *invest* (I.e., lose). If someone  IMs you out of concern for your mental health during the pandemic and says offhand that someone on your friends list made a billion trading forex, they’re gonna try to rope you into an imasteryacademy pyramid scheme. Tyvm, but I prefer yoloing meme stonks pushed by autistic cheerleaders during a massive credit expansion

Fine. If mods won't give me ANAL GOD then highest upvoted flair suggestion will have to do.
you sent me a screenshot from 2014, how much sadder does it get? My dude, I sent you dollars and cents. I even gave you **knowledge** on how these things work lmao. You could have cropped your 2014 clip from the internet  🤣 very sad specimen. Send dollars and cents today  🤡 , your net worth is nothing but a fake 2014 screenshot from the internet which still is less than what I have in just cash in my fidelity
Litteraly can't go tits up! 🚀
I truly wish everyone achieves their goals. Whether, it’s hookers, scraping up lunch money for a McRib, getting that down payment, getting enough to put in dividend stocks and chill, and of course lambos. Don’t know why you wouldn’t want GME to squeeze or anything really. we’d be sticking to the big guy once again and getting rich off of it. Beats getting rich of suffering imo. Rant over
You aint from michigan if u nevah done dis befoe

Been in and out of MAC since January (got diddled on the crash and flipped it later to break even). I do agree it has good upside as the worst damage to the market is behind us buuuut there’s so much better stocks around that price with better upside. As a diversifying your portfolio play I do like it tho

How do you get options that cheap tho
I put it and I m a x on my drop list yesterday and saw the bounce back. I'm sure they'll go up unless that one day up was a pump fake but that's not overly common it seems, lately, especially with a name brand.

I would've put some money on the max if I weren't already maxed out in vestments.

Gotta go through my holdings and find some runts to kick out.
In the page I read in the store, he was talking about the PayPal Mafia which is why I bought it. If they all went o to create LinkedIn, YouTube, Tesla and Palantir which at the time of writing were valued at $1bn each shows they know something.
This is the way

Damn the IV so fucking low. This is amazing! But the returns won’t be as good I believe. I’m bag holding PLTR 12/18 & 12/24 calls & at a loss of 80% rn. Do u think I should cut my losses & sell or wait longer ?

Let’s be real, I’m pretty lazy but I never once in my life said “I’m gonna pay someone to pickup take out for me” until COVID. Once COVID is gone, they aren’t gonna make anywhere near as much money. Right now, I’ll pay a couple extra bucks so I don’t get COVID, or Atleast reduce the chances, but after COVID, I won’t use Uber eats ever again.
Do you know what the actual function would be for that? Theoretically assuming theres no other variables at play. Im a little out of practice at my calculus skills lol
Not you
I don't understand any of this at all.

I see this sub so often, and posts like this

I think my paycheque would disappear.

Not a meme. It’s a lifestyle.
Hey u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR 

I’d say your ANAL GoD idea is pretty popular
Yeah it’s very possible they pull another extension. That’s why I’m selling this coming week. Don’t want to hold and get IV crushed more than I have already either. I think we will be ITM possibly Monday
This is why you don’t listen to r/Wall Street bets
But first I need to ask you a question does this rag smell like chloroform?
if you wantin poor peoples to stay poor, this sub seems the perfect place for that to happen
Guys, I was talking to the gf about stocks and I realized I dont know some basic info. When an owner of a company, ex. Elon, has shares in his company that goes public, does he then have to have a brokerage account for them? Where are his shares or other initial owners stored?

Speaking of ANAL, a 🙏 goes out to u/analfarmer2, the greatest YOLOer in wsb history.
10k worth of gamestop. 6 PLTR 32 calls for 1/15 that are down 70 percent. I couldn't forget to diversify so 3.74 percent of my portfolio is ES TEE PEE KAY. 


Overall I'm sitting on half a mil, just gotta wait.
4 for 4 from wendys and store the change in your ass, right where they hollowed it out from fucking you dry.
who you callin’ a SPAC?

Dude. Buy shares man. Us with the shares do all the heavy lifting. Calls alone won't start the squeeze.

I am a proud one of the proud ANAL GoDS
This is BS! Not a single person with experience doing a concrete driveway? /s
Yes exactly! I knew nothing at all and went all out with half my savings. Safe to say i have learned alot from it! 
Ouff... man that hard loss depression is a whole thing on it's own
Don’t think costed is used appropriately here...
Such an evil way to think though, knowing some poor shmuck is losing his life savings cause he’s not bright enough to know this is a pump and dump. While your profit off it.
For the squeeze potential - if and when it happens. I’m holding for Q4 earnings.
Lol nah, you're the only big 🧠
Yeah but this had to be way more exciting though right?
I pledge my allegiance 🙌🏻
7 years is a quick recovery time
MX performance on order.
I prefer to eat ass, is this still anal?
the way i see it is if your money is in the market then it's the market, doesn't matter if its in acb or something as long is its better than acb, you can always move it back to acb if you think its going to improve, but otherwise it's an emotional attachment for no reason.
I FINALLY got rid of that bag last week. Even though it cost me, I've been grinding back the losses this week.

Dead in the water, even temporarily, is dead in the water.

These screenshots are always options. They expire worthless so you don’t actually lose 300k, just whatever you put down upfront to purchase the option. Granted that was still quite a few thousands.
Ccl looking like its gonna breakout to the upside tho

Do the math. It is real my doubtful friend.
After seeing the post about some guy making $900k+ on $500 worth of TSLA calls, I’m crying even harder that I sold my 485c 12/18 two weeks ago.

I guess I am a retard
So I recall another recent thread here where the people shorting Tesla lost more money than the entire airline industry, and there was questions about “where did that money *go*?”

This guy. 

The money went to this guy. Right here. 

And to others like him.
Its crazy how often "white" is thrown in when talking down about somebody.  Such a weird phenomenon.  I guess it's trendy to be anti-white.
You all are sleeping on "ITB" (in the bum) ticker. Flies on Monday.
I want the spy 360 guy to win 🤷
Kinda want to be the one fucking their ass instead
If you love ANAL raise your hand
Save 30k for taxes... or lose it all. Your call.
Exactly why it’s targeted towards the ultra wealthy. We just ride their wave
More like now you know why I’m aware of the market conditions and the analysts that initiated coverage before the IPO. You are just a retard banker working for the man while you tell me misinformation like “no analysts can initiate coverage this soon” “it’ll pop to $50 billion but there’s no demand” and my favorite “I have more money than your entire family” when I didn’t even show you my 401ks or main investment accounts and I’m already at double your worth from one job in 2014

Real rich people don’t have all their money in one account you newb

I love how reading this some is will think “God, I’m glad I only trade options or futures” but others think “1% movement in an asset can mean I make 10x my initial input?  Sign my ass up!”

Thanks for putting this out btw.
Fucking truth
Go a little deeper inside the ANAL and you’ll find options
You just described the entirety of this subreddits operating model.
Bud lost a lot on this, CEO could give two fucks about this company.
Cuz someone said it might go as high as $500/share once the imminent short squeeze happens. 400 shares = over 200K.
Do you drive a Tesla now?
I love the idea of going to space but fail to see how this company will make much money...You literally get a short flight to the edge of the stratosphere in a glorified PilatusPC12 for a mere couple of minutes before returning to earth.
If you’re going to rape my bank account, then at least take me to another planet

You clearly knew nothing and got caught in a pump and dump, or something....anyways this same thing happened to me. Invested a thousand into CSGH about 17 years ago thinking lithium was the future and just sold it all for about $5.
Good lord, two minutes? Clearly these 5mil weren’t just luck!

GO ANAL OR GO HOMO
HPQ sorry i meant HPQ
Anal god me right in the tranche
What did he say?
I use td for my non retarded plays and Ira but I still don't see the ticker. Everyone was talking about cspan last night I literally can't find it anywhere
I remember my 1st cycle, I loved the psychological benefits more than my physical one lol. Never got used to the needles though.
Are April 2021s considered LEAPS?
I got 70
Canadian parliaments avoid like the plague any legislative language that clearly restricts the bureaucracy which ultimately manages and enforces said legislation. This is particularly true when the bureaucracy in question is the CRA or RCMP.

In this case the very useful language is "an adventure in the nature of trade". That's not vague at all, right?

The anecdotal trigger seems to be $250K CAD in your TFSA, though said bureaucrats refuse to admit it, and the legislation has no language at all to that effect. This is based on a few tax court cases; the most interesting of which was set to go to trial this year.

TL:DR; there is no clear definition of how much money you can have, profit you can make, or trade volume you can execute inside a TFSA, before the CRA determines that your tax free gains are no longer tax free, and in fact will be taxed as 'business income' rather than even as capital gains. The bureaucrats get to decide how much you can have before half of it belongs to them.
So I just went to a game stop to see how business was going, and potentially calm my nerves a bit going into this next week with the er coming up. Of course, this is totally anecdotal and only based off what I saw in one store location, but I'm not sure if what I saw was good or bad. 

I walked in, and there was a decent amount of customers in the store. Probably about 10 people. But nobody was buying anything. Someone asked an employee if they had ps5s in stock and they said they were sold out and only had xbox's. Women said "oh I'll just buy it online then." And left. You'd expect that gamestop would have some sort of pre order system in place so she could place an order and pick it up next week or something. Maybe they are just super backed up on orders. These employees should be trained to at the very least direct customers to the Gamestop website. 

After that, another customer tried to buy a game, and the employee told him that they were sold out. 

So I think the fact this stuff is selling quick is bullish, but the fact they are losing potential sales due to lack of inventory is not a good sign. I still think this earnings report is going to be a big beat, and I do think this company is undervalued, but there are a lot of flaws with this business model that need to be addressed. They could be killing it right now if they got their shit together.
These kind of gains on one position are unachievable for 99.9% of retail investors. You’re looking at a true unicorn here in this post. 

Very few people will have the resolve to not sell in the face of 100% or 1000% gains, let alone 200,000+%.

Imagine if ANAL was a ticker and we got to watch Jim Cramer melt down talking about it.
My dad would ask what a return is
Lol that other guy isn't on any fucking level either. He bought a $500 power ball ticket and it happen to hit.

It's actually scary seeing so many people think that guy is some master trader or something...like wtf lol

I like how everyone is making a remark about your returns, your use of the term tranche, and everything else that is cool, but the most respectable thing in my opinion is your diamond hands. Even after your options dropped you didn’t sell out for a profit like everyone else would have, rather you held and watched it rebound. Much respect good sir, I can see why your returns are better than mine 😞
can't wait to watch your entire (fake) net worth bleed out with Airbnb haha oh man talk about counting your chickens before they hatch, no wonder you're so emotionally invested in this IPO LMFAO! Airbnb is going down the drain along with your fake 17k shares haha

Dude I got one, it's amazing,  watch some videos,  works very well! It's for sure a cool saw to own!
Probably because he only invested $460 and considered $460 an acceptable loss if it went to 0
How much you paid for those calls. Are they not down 50% already?
Why should I hold GME through earnings?

How often did you go to the cinema in 2019?
I'm thinking April or July. I'm a pussy though and dont want to go too far OTM. Probably not higher than 30?

What about you?
It’s possible. APHA is a bit less jumpy than, say, ACB. I think $10 is a stretch, but the honest answer is I’m just not sure. If I had to guess I would say the only way it reaches $10 is if the Georgia runoff goes exactly cannabis’s way and the sector bubbles up, but I don’t think you’ll see $10 before 1/5. I hope I’m wrong though, and I very well may be. 

The run up to the runoff will be very interesting.
This boy has the shine.

Video first.
I don’t really think trading will go back to normal after this year. For those who think they missed out this year on bad trades or just trying to learn and got their ass blasted, next year will be even crazier imo. So be ready and stay humble.
Imagine having nothing to so you refresh the weekend discussion thread on 2 minutes intervals and grin at half of the comments. Autismo intensifies.

Forget about cars.   They're a depreciating luxury moneypits unless you buy something rare with appeal and don't drive it.

Plus you're not including the cost of ownership if you do drive it regularly.  Tires, Brakes, potentially Oil changes, parts that fail, and the biggest of all insurance.

I'd rather have a house that's mine.  No more landlord that can snoop around or evict at any point in time.  No more neighbors sharing a wall, floor, or ceiling with me.  Can decorate however I want.  Have a garden and landscaping how I want it.  Private garage.  And mostly no more throwing money away on rent.

People think being a landlord is easy, but it's fucking hard and financially pretty scary. But of course that's how buildings get maintained and people who can't afford to buy houses find places to live!

What's easy is being a large shareholder of a multi billion dollar real estate company. Very different from being a landlord.
HEY MY BLACKBERRY SHARES MADE ME $5. IM RICH BOYSSSS
he always struck me as kind of a robot autist idk if i could get through a book written by him
Start selling the shit their buying if you really think they’re that dumb. Free money
The weird part is that they sound the same
1 MILLION and 1 DOLLARS
Yeah agree. One of the most significant event for spy in the decade and we are saying it is consolidating. 

Only Michael burry will short the stock before it.
I'm not hating, I don't pay attention to the faang since I don't think it should swing much in either direction. Hell, I have no clue what it does since I don't pay attention to it.
Help a fellow retard understand better plz!

Td ameritrade has never let me down in that regard.
I tried this two months ago and blew my account up when they traded sideways for months. Still trying to recover. I was so convinced it was going to moon leading up to earnings and CPU and GPU announcement. Then the Xilinx deal was announced and I was fucked on my calls.
You are just clueless dude.
TSLA 585/595 debit spreads 12/31

That can come back pretty fast.

Sounds like the broker just sells the position whenever it goes down equal to the amount you put in, in essence losing your money and just taking theirs back
Next meme stock
i would say no you were right about 23-25 range though.... do me a favor an check out the 24c 12/18 on hpq an tell me what you think.... but i wouldnt bet on pltr doing that specially because people wont be buying loads of stock getting closer to christmas/holidays

Lolol as usual you see you are drastically poorer and you try to change the subject to “more screenshots” as if I lost all my pre IPO stock for no money

The IPO is next week you clown

I’m on a mobile phone. You’re lucky I humored a poor banker like you with a screenshot
Ok
So you did a quick internet search for confirmation bias of your ridiculous stance on a topic you know nothing about, you probably only read the headline of this article, and make the claim that "Computers can do a better job than you" directed at OP. You're a moron. When you're done with your fleshlight maybe you can share some thoughts on the link you provided? Or any reasonable evidence to support your position?
I bought Peter Thiels book today, let's see
Cramer likes to talk shit about young people trading on the markets today as if things were any different back in the 70's (1670s), as if all those guys were reading books and doing 300 hours of DD. The is no difference people trading on the markets then, they were just as autistic, the only difference was that they'd send a buy order by carrier pigeon instead of opening an app. They were worse if anything - they always bought the news 9/10 of their trades were literally buying the news. The average DD was also no different "Hey Purdue I went to that tulip stand and there were more people there than in the other tulip stand" "Oh cool I'll buy 1000 bulbs let me call my broker" They also had meme stocks like Semper Augustus
Yes
Short term pain, long term prosperity > short term prosperity, long term chaos

Thank you! It’s all a bit overwhelming, but I’m going to call on Monday

Well that's all chump change now. Enjoy it, I hope not to see a post explaining how you lost it all in the future!

I got $30k+ of 2023 & 2022 leaps ranging from $110-$130. There is a solid chance the stock doubles since the market is still growing alongside with AMD’s market share within the market

Be a proud upvote bull instead of a gay downvote bear and the world will be full of more joy and orgies at no extra cost or effort! You are only allowed to be a gay bear when it comes to gay 'companies' such as NKLA, where the double negative cancels out. You're actually being a bull if you bet against them as you're a part of the equity relocation project, bringing their investor's capital to companies that deserve to moon.
Dang so CHWY and GME are doing their ER on the same day? Shieeetttt. I was really hoping Cohen would bust in on GME.

Market “pretend” it doesn’t care. And also everyone knows a wave is coming but no one knows how big of a wave it will be. I bet is quarter million infected starting next Tuesday. Over 3K death daily by end of next week. For the following week, it will be exponential growth unless shutdown is implemented. And I feel there is a role for palantir to play in this Greek tragedy.
Might wait for a dip tho

I bought a few books on AMZN the other day. Figured I’d read at least one, but nah.
If being real this is not a DIY situation.  Get yourself a good lawyer who will pay for his services many times over.
But think about "tHe TeChNolOgY". This feels like the big B-word bubble of 2017, hearing the similar arguments for valuation of Tesla.
you assumed i bought high that’s why.

Oh no please no oh fuck
You guys are pretty cool. I like it here. It's so comfy!
I hope ANAL is the top ticker for data scrapers on monday
With all these posts about WSB GME ownership and the upcoming earnings, it'll be funny if there was a way WSB could buy up like 50%+ of the available float in GME and no one sells it/lends it out to shorts, which could cause a similar squeeze that Porsche (WSB in this case) did to VW back in the day.
if palantir reaches half of TSLA's market cap the stock price would be $163.

dont let your memes be dreams
$2-3K on short term stupid trades.
Are you that dumb you haven’t considered it’s what I had available on my phone?

That IPO pop is gonna feel mighty good isn’t it. An extra house in Cabo
I think with Forex, the losses are more immediate and abrupt. There's immediate feedback/reinforcement to stop.

With options, the losses are both gradual as well as immediate and abrupt. They're also more accessible, prone to hype, and can therefore easily delude millions (1.7M to be precise--wow this subs gotten so big) into thinking they can make a profit in the end.
You’re one of us
nah the underlying stock was around 200 and this contract was prob around 600 pre split
my dude, this shouldn't be this hard, especially for little tech boys like yourself. send proof of your assets **today** or stfu.

You are correct. Setting a limit sell order does not affect shorts. The only way to be safe is to call your brokerage(impossible on robinhood) and request they don’t loan your shares out.

Doesn’t that assume that the stock stays at the same price and volatility remains high?

Elon owns a shit load of stripe. Elon has said very publicly he regrets taking Tesla public bc of the control shareholders got over him. Collision brothers feel the same way, I’m sure collision bros and Elon have talked or at least collision bros know of musks regrets.  Going semi public (only 10% via spac) allows collision brothers to get on stock exchange, it limits sell side pressure and maximizes buy side pressure and they retain full control of the board. SPAC makes the most sense for stripe in my opinion.

 Why don't you send an updated screenshot? Why are you sending shit from 2014? For all I know you sold your shares in the secondary market lmao.

yes.  I transferred TSLA leap options from TD to IB earlier this year.  Works same as stock transfer.
The problem with your TA is that your boxes completely ignored the actually TA, which is that Friday’s close was an ATH close which means the uptrend is still intact.  So what evidence do you have that we’ve reached the consolidation region?

They're both probably true tbh. Options activity for both calls and puts has exploded this year

My guess is you sold a covered call that got called away and Robinhood's charting hasn't caught up yet. I'm a big Robinhood fan because of their UI and convience but they do have some issues. Wacky charting errors are one. Give it a couple days and it should fix itself as settlement goes through.

Thank you
You guys think RKT can pass AMZN this week?
I own 10 PSTH non-standard delivery calls at 22.5 Dec18. There's no good reason to sell these right? The warrants I'll get on top will pay off the premium I spent to acquire them. The spread and volume on the non-standard is just atrocious now (like bid is 2 and ask is 7(fair value is like 4)). I should just wait till the 18th and execute right? 22.5 is nearly the redeemable value and I don't think we'll ever see it again tbh. How confident are we in the Q1 2021 time frame and should I even consider selling calls afterwards with Jan expiration? If so what strike seems safe? I'm pretty inclined to let it all ride after execution. Uncle Ackman's taking us to the promise land right? Stripe, Coinbase, Bloomberg, Robinhood, Fidelity all feels the same to me. Anyone else riding uncle ackmans mature unicorn ?

They do have zero revenue, that’s known. The idea here is getting in early. If/when the catalysts roll in, price upgrades, production validation, endorsements, etc, it will take off and you miss the run up. They were too early to the EV game when they were around early 2000’s and ultimately collapsed largely in part due to the bankruptcy of the battery maker that they partnered with. This time around, they have a beautiful SUV to bring to market, an established production partner, intriguing lease model, 0 debt, billions in capital due to going public this time and a much more proven EV demand landscape. They’re design is nicer than any Tesla ever made ( I’m still a huge fan of Tesla ). It’s a gamble, but it will run up to either a take off in share price when they prove concept or a major pull back if they don’t. My money is on them making it.

Snowflake utilizes the public data cloud, so AWS, Google, etc. Redshift already does a lot Snowflake does, but my understanding is that Snowflake is much more easier to use and integrate existing data warehouses. Snowflake allows any data on its platform to be shared/analyzed with any other data on the Snowflake platform (barring permissions of course).

As far as I know, the advantages of Snowflake have to do with cost (paying is directed more at computing instead of storage, where AWS charges up the ass for storage). Snowflake is also faster with scaling than Redshift, but Amazon is already improving this. Redshift is also more utilized for the AWS ecosystem, where Snowflake is more broader public cloud based.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good business, but they're going up against the largest companies in the world at something they excel in. The price is currently too high and not taking into account any competition in the future imo.

it's true. i've just lost like more than 2% trying to do Norbert's gambit on Scotia iTrade because they are so fucking slow to journal over DLR. if I was in Interactive Brokers, this shit would have been instant and only cost $2. Right now I paid $9.99 and I'm losing like $100 because the US dollar decided to shit itself the week I needed to convert some USD back to CAD. Probably **like $200 in commisions** over the year since I was DCAing my paycheck over the year

Same to you dude. Things would need to go very seriously wrong for me not to come out ahead at this point.
You need 100 shares to sell 1 covered call contract.  

And you have no idea how retarded you are.
It means you can’t sell a single call because you need 100 shares at least
15/hr in ny is like .20c/hr in kansas
Why RKT, because they are buying back shares? They already have too many private shares imo, I think dilution risk is a reason they suck so bad. I was bagholding that shit for far too long.
Guess you don’t know how decimals work. .023 is 23 cents you idiot. It’s $23 per contract, I’m talking about price per share. 23 cents never existed. For that contract
Jeez get off of high IV stocks or you will be lining up at food banks for your canned soup. If you’re going into high IV always buy the stock and sell otm covered calls. PLTR has almost 25% weekly upside from selling covered calls with significantly less risk. Look for low IV, high delta options if you’re trying to make money.

The only reason nio would ever get delisted is if China goes Hardline anti-us and says no for the sake of not giving any Americans anything out of spite. Honestly I think the US is biting off more than they can chew here. The current Chinese administration has been way more hardcore on taking down corruption and here we are calling them out and demanding that they let us do whatever we want or they'll delist Chinese companies from American exchange.

What if China turns around and goes "Fuck you America, no Tesla's can be sold in China. We're taking over that manufacturing plant as retaliation for demanding that we let you coerce us into your conditions"?

Now I don't think that would happen but if China doesn't want to deal with this delisting bill while still having Chinese companies listed on the New York stock exchange, they could pull a move like that to get what they want. This could end up getting really ugly if the two countries won't just come to amicable terms

It's a bad argument for Amazon because everyone but you uses it. I don't know a single person that shops at gamestop, I buy all my games through the PS store or Steam, the only reason you would buy a game at gamestop is so that you could return it if you like but they don't even accept returns after like 48 hours or something where as amazon accepts returns after months. Anyone smart would just turn around and sell the game on ebay instead engage in their ripoff buyback program.
Correct.  Tesla hit $680 pre-split late January/early February 2020.  It hit $340 (half that strike) pre-split in summer 2017 and at various other times before it’s crazy runs...  so it doesn’t surprise me.

We have completely dominated Wall Street this year and CNBC still wants to run their mouth. Fuck em boys, we just have to be prepared to buy puts when this whole thing comes crashing down while dumbass institutions buy a dip that never recovers.
Aight I love anal anyway so hit me with that flair fam
im pretty retarded so bare with me. I bought like 30 shares. what does selling calls against those mean?
Nobody cares but I'm taking a shit right now and it smells like cat litter
Wtf 😳 I did not know people were still getting paid 10-12$ a hour wtf bro ?

A friend who is a shift assistant super visor at Starbucks makes 13$ a hour ???

In Kansas bro 

Wtf 

Why ?



NYC has a min wage of 15$ a hour ...

I have been away from options for a couple months, still been following market though. Someone give me some plays here. Where can i throw 1k

Guy from work gets in trouble about once a week for slacking while trading cause he can't put his phone down long enough to work. He's put in a chunk of money and is convinced he's gonna quit one day for it.. But all he's told us about is losses. He also paid almost 5 THOUSAND dollars to fly to some dude in California with a YouTube channel to learn Forex and be mentored.. Just to still be working and living here.

Thinking percentages are gains, truly retarded
Always great to see these posts
I’m upvoting like crazy rn
So what’s your plan expiry coming up? Exercise or sell. Given that’s there’s almost 0 volume on options that deep ITM and on a weird strike price, who buys those?
You see that 200,000% gain on TSLA?  That’s the highest % ever
This is the correct answer
So what you're telling me you're always right 50% of the time and wrong 50% of the time?
The big dog behind this play is T. They are hurting for cash and in the streaming wars. They are doing this play to beat other players in the biz.

Welcome to the team
Can i have 100 upvotes
Can I be ASS MAN?
Yes, but tolerance is very low (0.1%) and tesla too heavy. It will likely push them out of tolerance should they try to buy earlier or later.

Besides, it doesn't matter as investment banks are probably siphoning shares to sell to the funds at the closing price of the 18th as well to keep volatility in check.

Also, the 18th was chosen because of quadruple witching that brings heavy volume to the market, which again eases volatility.

We will see. I'm thinking of exiting my positions at close of the 18th.hope I'm right.

Best of luck and hope you make money.
Ahh yeah I've seen it before, I remember now. Deja vu cum
Any chance I can get Agent Dill Doe added?
Baloney. That doesn't make it undervalued. Note, I am NOT saying that in hindsight it was obviously a stock any time before now you absolutely should have bought a ton of. Just that it's valuation has NEVER made sense. It has always required execution, and more importantly, irrational hype. To be fairly valued at its current price it would need orders of magnitude more revenue and profit. Will it get there? Possibly. Soon enough to justify TODAY's stock price, taking into account inflation and opportunity cost? Almost certainly not.
Haha, it was a two second google search.  I'm reminded of it every time I hear hot yoga.

Next leg down next week. TSLA $100
No, the brokers take 0 risk.

You put in 100$ and they loan you say 9900 dollars.

You make a 10k position somewhere, so now you own 10k of shares.

The price of.your position decreases 100$ and goes to 9900.   You get 'margin called', unless you put extra money in before now, the shares are sold for 9900 and the broker gets there.money back, you lost your 100$

FYI Walmart used to carry a whole array of computer parts about 25 years ago.  Graphics cards, Sound cards, and I think RAM as well as hard drives and some CPUs.  Plus a huge aisle of software (mostly games but also productivity).

But since they got out of that business, no one has filled the space (outside of BestBuys but those aren't generally in small to medium sized towns).  And since PC gaming as only grown since then, it makes it opportune for someone to service that community.

If it really takes off, I'd like to see them double their floorspace as Gamestop Ultimate stores and offer a larger assortment of hardware and gaming loot.  As well as a section of the floor dedicated to game competitions and meetups.  

Humans are social creatures.  They'll be back in stores after coronas is effectively over.  And having compos and matches in house draws more people to your store.  Foot traffic is generally a good thing, I think.  (as long as they're not walking out with unpurchased merchandise haha)
You may be on to something
Anybody else buying GUSH leaps?

Hell, a good way to practice is just using game economies. Like idk runescape, eve online or something, it's more or less the same principle without actually losing real money. Then again, nobody wants to be known the guy who learned his market skills from the grand exchange, unless of course you win big.
Yeah it’s all up in the air imo. I’m in CO and they’re letting the big ski resorts open up, I’m a local to one of them and it’s just a shit show. But at the same time they’re closing restaurants to takeout only
I've never understood this "don't want to pay taxes" BS. If you make a net profit, you have to pay taxes at some point.

Biggest mistakes this year: buying SNOW shares at $250 and PLTR shares at $11 on IPO dates and daytrading instead of holding. Also getting bored of CRSR leaps at $20 and NET shares at $36 because “they weren’t moving.” PAPER HANDS. Guh.

Best moves: jumping in TSLA and SQ in June.

Common theme: need to get diamond hands early on. Maybe Airbnb and Roblox?

Yes I get that but he bought these when they were 600% OTM. I have never ever seen a contract for basically any stock that has an option 600% OTM listed in the chain... Maybe there are some and I've just never seen them.

I’ve got a good feeling about this company. A lot of skepticism holding it back from taking off. I think there are a lot of people sitting on the sidelines waiting for a reason to jump in.

Positions: 10 x 5/21 10C’s and 10 x 12/21 20C’s. Both of which I intend to exercise depending on price action around expiry. I consider these place holders to inevitably buy shares, without tying up too much of my capital that could be invested elsewhere in the meantime.

Doesn't make a difference, just assume they are SPY and I bought shit positions.

That's how I roll.
The presplit 680c would be the 130ish call now.

No?

How can we verify whether the option existed.

Also, most companies option strike prices are up to 2x market price at most (e.g tesla leaps go up to $1300 or so..) so how would he have bought some multiple of the then market price leap?

Just interested in understanding.

Soros is among the wokeratti; platitudes over profits. With Microsoft and Google out of the security cloud, PLTR is a longterm grow.
So that’s intel’s 70 call being up 333% since November 12th.

That isn’t your trade.
Billy Madison!
Did the exact same. When’d you sell?
The deal with AWS does not mean much - as the quote in your link says they are at 0% competing  against the 100% market share of nvidia. If you have studied the history of intel you would know that they have dominated every market where they could leverage their x86 monopoly advantage and flopped in every market they could not.

Having access to the chips via AWS does not mean much. They need to provide an ecosystem that can rival CUDA and a decade of developer experience.

They are on the wrong side of that deal for any of their experience to help them.
I love my autie plays, but when I need to destress a bit it’s hard to not go with a full ARK hand. They are killing it right now.

I'm up 90% this year so far, and based on the close Friday that may end up being closer to 200-300% by the end of the year, thanks for your concern.
Gone for an hour and suddenly everyone is an ANAL GOD.
Of course! Think of volume as the number of contracts traded that particular day. If an option has a volume of 100 and you buy 50 contracts, you just traded half that option’s volume, if you want to get out of that trade quick there will be less people around to buy it from you, as not many other people are trading that particular option (Keep in mind this is always changing). The higher the volume means more people and means you have a better chance to get in and out of a trade and the better the chance you will pay less to get in and get out of that trade. 


Why does this matter? The lower the volume means there are not as many people trading that option that you are interested in- which means it is a more dangerous position to enter and you may get stuck in that position, and if there is a buyer when you want to sell that position and realize profit, the more likely you will be giving more of that potential profit trying to meet that buyer (bidder) in the middle to get out. 



When there is large volume on an option it means that many people are trading that option and they are constantly changing hands and that tightens (lowers) the difference between what people are asking for that option (seller) and what people are bidding for that option (buyer). Usually the rule of thumb is to get in/out of trade faster, you will need to buy at the ask and sell at the bid. So if the bid ask spread is wide and you buy 100 contracts you’ll be paying potentially a bunch to get in and out of a trade. 



I refuse to touch any low volume options unless I’m super confident or it moved so much that I know I can most likely still profit even with a wide bid ask spread. I prefer high volume (The higher the better), and high OI (Open interest, or number of contracts that currently exist on that day) and a max bid ask spread of one cent (One dollar per contract).


I always set the limit order a few cents below the bid after an already big defined movement and wait to see if it’ll move more and trigger it/ get filled first before setting limit order at the bid. No need to pay more when most times you don’t need to. Of course there are times you’ll try going at the bid and then it reverses completely and you wish you bought at the ask and didn’t try to save pennies. 


I mostly scalp weekly options though and have a set few stocks in which I watch the contracts movement all day for good opportunities where the contract jumps a bunch a certain way, and then try and catch it when it reverses. So for me low bid ask spread is crucial because if I’m buying 100 contracts I want to pay the least amount to get in and get out. Find what is right for you though! Hope this helped, feel free to DM with any further questions.
I only order doordash when high, so if we apply this to stock fundamentals. Stock price isn’t too high imo

Trust me when I tell you your good. Don’t sell until it’s over 130 most likely will see it EO January if I had to bet I wish you didn’t buy the top
I will sell December calls after earnings and move that into April calls a few days later.

Nope. Forex brokers that allow leverage also have stop losses which never allow you to go over the amount of money in your account. You can quite literally lose everything in seconds

>This was a series of lottery tickets and nothing more. I hope that OP takes the slot machine winnings and leaves options behind forever. There is absolutely no way this can be replicated.

Tbh, I think posts like this legit warp perceptions...when you said "series of lottery tickets.." it clicked more in my head just how absolutely insane this is.

There is no way this could be anything other than luck, right? Lol 

I mean, OP was mentioning "good price" or some shit on a comment above but there is just no fucking way this can be replicated.

I would love to know the initial investment cuz to pull out over 5MM from a couple hundred dollar bets...is incomprehensible to me lol
Uhhhh..... done bro.. done.... im upvoting everything i see.
im holdings puts on GME for right after the earnings report. it’s retarded but i’m hoping people who sunk their life savings into it for the squeeze will paper hands
I grabbed March calls yesterday. I got 24, 25 and 26 strike. I want to get 2023 leaps in a week or two though. I will probably get some contracts at 40 and 50.

Not so sure about 60 in three week though. Maybe a few months!
For long term yeah. it never really goes below $34. If anyone can snag it below $35 I think it’s a great price for long term gains. It’s not going to run up fast to $50 like the first time around.
Anyone holding CHWY calls? And are you going to hold through earnings or sell before EOD 12/8? I feel like it’s ready to 🚀ATHs

Plently of promising IPOs dip off the bat, so it's very possible. Just buy the shares you want over a few days.

Everyone says that the price of the stock has already been priced in, but then again the earnings are supposed to be horrible, so does this mean the stock will just stay at the current level since the earnings are already priced in?

They make a monthly commission based upon how many people they recruit and how many people YOU would recruit.
I’m thinking of pulling out while still green. They got extension and no news about the merger.
Yes they will report lower earnings but no one cares bc market is forward thinking. It’s all about the guidance they issue and future developments. 

If we knew for sure what that guidance would be it would be much easier. 

I’ll say this, if you do not in the very core of your being understanding what’s happening with the company and believe in the trade don’t buy calls. I would buy shares before earnings with no hesitation at all though. No idea if they pay off next week or in 6 weeks but price will be up.

Could do that. IV for 1/15/21 is around 170% with 4/21/2021 around 150%. IV will still drop for both assuming a dip, but you're going to feel it just a little more on the Jan calls.

I'm trying to figure out if I want to sell my January calls Monday and immediately turn them into shares. If there's a dip after earnings my percent drop will be less painful in shares than in calls, and I'll exchange these shares back to April calls once IV cools down. If it moons during this process then at least I'm still onboard for the ride holding shares.
Well, know we have a fairly solid idea of how many physical shares we (as one giant group of autists) are holding, would it be worthwhile to do a similar spreadsheet for options, just to get a rough ballpark of how many shares the MM are likely buying (or selling I suppose, for the bears buying puts) to hedge their option contracts? Just to get a better idea of what the real, available float number is. The options I am holding represent a lot more shares than the actual shares I am holding, and I doubt I'm alone, knowing how everyone on here behaves...
I like 360.

What's Snowflake unique advantage? I understand Amazon has Redshift which is a comparable data warehousing solution to Snowflake, unless things have changed since I read about this stuff, which might very well be the case. What does the adoption landscape looks like right now? And how difficult it is for clients to switch over from one service to the other? I am not well versed in this, but I understand Snowflake is built on the AWS platform, akin to a plugin built to service a software. Is my understanding correct? And doesn't this mean Snowflake can easily be swapped out with another Product that benefits from better integration?

I had 30 $690 (presplit) June 2020 calls with cost basis of $0.20. I sold some in Feb and some in June for total gain of around $780,000. 

Best part was that I had $400K in cash going into March. That is how I got to $5M total return.
Nice diversification.
Dude when you gonna do it, I just want get 250 more shares below 26. Let the peasants get some soup before the pump

When does airbnb go public and should I buy?
That all makes perfect sense!  Kinda stuck with short term gains though when it comes to options.  Even with the higher tax rates it makes sense to sell leaps during market rights rather than sitting on them
Would you mind sharing your config? I’ve got one of these.
IV is largely based on the bid/ask spread. On calls, as long as the sell/ask spread of the underlying stock is tight enough it will cause the IV to go down on calls. Buying cheap calls is like a cheat code. I try to find that 5-10 minute drop off in share price and I confidently buy calls. The fed is backstopping the market which is why it hasn’t dropped. Look at insider buys vs sells. A few weeks after Golden parachutes are given out the stock will drop. 07-09 all over again. Charts almost line up exactly.

It’s - complicated- not something I feel like typing out to your degens . Just keep $12-$15 dollars in your head.  Trade as you wish.  PLTR is an absolute winner in my book, just not right now.  Their technology is sound but their corporate execution is not quite there to hold this valuation and within a short period of time, they will see an extreme amount of competition.   

Long story short - they are utilizing AI to find enhanced decision making opportunities for companies.  It’s special because it’s one of the first, but it’s not special because this is where the entire world is going - so expect extreme competition going forward.  

I won’t invest in this company until end of next year.
I'm genuinely curious not being argumentative. I just started messing with covered calls and I dont think I grasp covered puts as clearly yet.. Reading up on it.
Apple or Microsoft. They also haven't moved in months either which is actually good if you want to buy now. This is the Jan 22 leaps btw so long time horizon.
Shares and April calls yolo! I'm all in, but I do expect up to a 30% drop back to the 12's if things don't go well this ER. 

In my opinion, the main juicy juice is the March ER with the console sales / christmas sales earnings.
With CA going into lockdown idk. Plus the Pfizer vaccine is like sitting on a cactus pain in the ass to deal with, fda probably gonna wait for one with higher effectiveness and easier to deal with

I think you're supposed to be offering yours in this context
Any options trading resource. It’s considered level 1 options trading because it’s low risk. You would be the one selling the original options contract, calls in this case, to others. You collect the premium and then hope they expire worthless for them so you don’t have to sell your shares. Or it does hit the strike, and as long as you set the strike higher than you bought them, which is very likely with inherited shares, you still win.  It’s what’s considered “theta gang” here, because you are taking advantage of the time decay

They have a pretty shoddy track record so far reporting on the inclusion, so I can’t say I’m surprised. They reported that there was a possibility the inclusion would take place across quarters, and that is literally impossible. I am going to be exiting my positions beginning the week of 12/14 and should be completely out by 12/18. I plan on buying shares and potentially puts to hedge them.

Wont they be reporting lower earnings? Just didn’t know if anyone has reason to believe a report of loss would cause a big enough sell off to wait for a dip? I’m extra autizz and don’t know what I’m doing. If there was reason to believe there’s be a 10-20% dip I’d want to wait for that but no way to really know I guess.
This makes it so much sweeter.

This.  One of these REIT companies should come forward with a concrete plan on converting existing/dying malls into housing complexes.  Typical suburban malls already have mass transit connections, large parking lots to convert to SBUX, MCD, DRI locations if they don't already exist, and large open areas inside for community resources.  Throw in a bank, a retail pharmacy, an urgent care facility, and even a charter school and you can now promote the self-contained community of the future.  The sprawling retail footprint to support the local tax base is an era that has come to an end and has left too many communities with wasted unoccupied/poor use properties.

TSLA options are very liquid even deep itm calls. There is still a small time premium.

Bid ask spread on this is $0.15.
And you do understand that options are priced by a calculus formula correct?

That price doesn't just reflect current day returns, but the anticipated price based upon previous performance over the history of the option.

The price is projecting approximately a 12-14% increase in value day over day between now and 1/15 because that's what the average has been over the last 18 months, plus the increase in implied volatility.

Everyone saying “buy shares” is retarded, don’t listen to them. yes, buying shares is more helpful than buying calls. But longer dated calls do two things. One: the have delta, which one a call becomes itm mimics shares. Two: the delta also forces mm to hedge by BUYING SHARES. it’s a win-win. The real reason to buy shares is gme may drop after earnings and you don’t want to be caught bag holding.
That’s only if you wanna be conservative. I already said fuck it and went all in

I think that these SPACs sometime take a few days to wind up and this one is just starting to do that. Volume has been increasing from a few thousand a day to 1.5mill and if you look at others like PIC, GMHI, these volume numbers continue to rise and those are the days with the big gains. The IV isnt nearly as bad as it is in some of these other SPAC’s but it is increasing.

Yo. There are no bears anymore, this only goes up.
I can sell at current market value which for deep itm calls is roughly stock price minus strike with small time premium. Disadvantage of exercising is that that resets clock for long term capital gains. If so sell now I pay just 20% tax.

InNOut would get retail hype and the stock would instantly be more valued than McDonald’s a la Tesla vs Toyota.

“I expect it and hope it drops for 30 minutes into open causing the IV to plummet”

Large price movements cause IV to rise. Therefore the part of the option, both calls & puts, that is tied to volatility (Vega) will becomes more valuable and youll have to pay more for it

** Although that effect is masked since the price is moving down - calls will be “cheaper”. Not from volatility though **
well old people are fucked anyways
Brother hold your fking positions (or shares). We’re gonna be a apart of history with this squeeze
Name checks out
Earnings won't predict short squeeze so the IV might not get cut in half immediately after earnings. Typically earnings + guidance kills uncertainty/IV but does not make up for other black swans like a unpredictable short squeeze. Even if RC doesn't try a takeover or GME doesn't offer a buyback the squeeze might still happen. 

RKT had the same level of IV but immediately dropped 80-100% after earnings, you could have sold 2021 $40 calls for $10/contract and bought them back for $1-2/contract two weeks later (even at a sh price of 25-28), I sold shorter dated puts and calls and made decent return, enough to still sell my RKT shs at $21 for a profit. I'm a bit more cautious selling cc's for my GME shs this time but if they get called away I'll take my 30% gains and move on.
Indeed.
Can PLTR hit 60 by EOY?
I’m *in*!
Wsj article stated that funds will buy on the 18th,not before and not after. The reason is that otherwise they wouldn't be tracking S&p and tesla is big enough to move them outside their 0.1% tracking tolerance should they buy earlier/later.

As for etfs, you will be able to see if they do happen to buy earlier as it will show on their daily makeup.

I can't imagine tesla keep going up after the 21st..no idea why anyone would buy after, but who knows.. It's tricky to figure out what to do if you own shares.

Sell all on the 18th?
Sell some and buy puts for the 25th to hedge in case it tanks?

Can confirm that was lottery ticket. I also bought it at that low (technically a wee bit higher at $182), but at the time my absolute best, most positive, most bull guess was it’ll hit $400 in like a year. The peak at the time was $380 from the going private tweet Elon made.

Calling a $680 at that time would’ve been absolutely insane. Literally a “eh I can lose $500 for a lottery ticket” kind of situation.
It was a $680C 15Jan21 ... pre-split means it got fifthed.  1/5 of $680 = take a guess.

When are they expected to IPO? What platform do you use for trading?
I don't disagree with your post except if I would never sell shares even after the inclusion. Calls maybe, depends on the IV. I expect it to be less volatile after inclusion but it still has an asymmetric upside call skew.
I've always wanted to be an anal god tbh
OK let me use an example.

Eh, I mean the stock went from around 10-11 to 32 in the past two weeks. They’re already valued higher than their competitor Velodyne and they don’t even have close to the same number of sales. Luminar isn’t even the leading lidar company but they’re leading in market cap. The only thing that’s stupid about these options is the IV imo. I think it’s a solid company but I don’t think the market is properly valuing them.

If you follow the posters over half the time will see their loss porn later.  Get addicted to that rush and don't walk away and put it in SPY like they should when they do get lucky.
If you sell a covered call and it gets ITM, someone who bought the call might at any time (and on expiration certainly will) exercise their call option. When that happens you get ‘assigned’ and are forced to sell you shares at the strike price of the call. So if your strike price was $5 and the underlying rises to $6, you have to sell your shares at the $5 strike and your shares are gone. You do however always keep the premium you made from selling the option in the first place.

Hope that helped! New to this but explaining the concepts helps me lock them in too
Half and half
It won’t go up in a straight line, there are always opportunities. 

So it really just depends on what you think guidance will be for Q4 (which is really what matters). There has been amazing due diligence by uberkikz and others that suggests somewhere in the $2-5 range. You can figure out a price estimate from there. 

If you believe that to be the range I would imagine a significant spike right after earnings, some consolidation, and then a steady rise to April. 

If your plan is to buy shares you won’t go wrong. If you’re buying December calls just remember how crazy the premium is right now, how volatile things will be around earnings and that IV will come crashing down fast. That’s a fast in and out. Like all of my sexual adventures.
prob not a bad idea. I sold my shares in a junior oil producer on friday for some gainz. Rolled it into something else. Kind of wishing I had just held that position since I think oil still has a lot of upside. What can I say? Paper hands.
If you can’t recognize that a meme stock with Housing (during best housing market ever) & Travel (during huge travel stock surge due to vaccines) & Technology (with Nasdaq at all time highs) is going to moon then I’m sorry
But isn't the point to protect my position if it doesn't spike. How does selling puts do that?
Yeah being 5-6 years ahead (conservatively) of established car companies in terms of technology means absolutely fuck all. Your an idiot if you think Tesla is extremely over valued. A little over valued? Sure. But no where near what you are saying.
Lmao once again for the reading challenged here, they didn't increase the range, there is one range and one range only. The WSJ article from 11/29 was from before they came out with an official range. It was speculating that the range they would eventually come out on 12/1 would be higher than what was discussed internally from before. No one knows if that is true or not, it's WSJ speculation. ABNB has only ever officially guided to $44 - $50  🤡🤡🤡

I’m timing it. I expect and hope it drops for 30 minutes into open causing the IV to plummet and the option calls to be cheap as hell. If I can buy enough options to force a delta hedge then I can sell half at 150% profit and not have any personal risk. I’d be gambling with house money which is always my goal when buying a lot of options. For example: I bought spy 270p in September for $100(1.00) exp 11/20. They went up to $1000 around early november, so I sold 1/3 of them to gain some realized profits and go to break even+200%. It ended up turning on me and I’m extremely happy I pulled profit to break even+ more.

I will just say that in 2012, I wanted to put my entire savings into TSLA but everyone said how stupid that was, it was hugely overvalued and it can't stay that high forever. See how that turned out.

Still waiting on those prices to come back down to earth all this time, and I imagine people waiting for TSLA to fall will just keep on waiting.

I agree! The risk reward isn’t great. I do the same but on a much smaller scale. SPX/SPY CREDIT spreads are a terrible way to go in my opinion. I just find high IV stocks like QS and there are some spreads you can put on with a negative risk reward. Ie. Risk 80 to make 400 with an equal delta. 

What kind of method do you use then?

I actually got super unlucky on my timing since they diluted shortly afterwards but even with that and all the short term shit talk from the Tesla bears, it's up 20%+ from my post and will continue to go up. Shares are almost the best trade you can make long term, unless you can time the call buying jumps, which is hard.
Wait why?? I’ve got fb puts. Did I win??

For example an AMD $140c 1/20/23 would "only" return you 49,000% if it went up 8000 fucking percent by 1/20/23 so how the fuck did he manage 200,000%?
Agreed. No clue how this company has not gone up. They make money, have a great growth outlook, and announced a plan to buy back a large amount of shares. Definitely in this one for the long haul.

Bro. You enlightened me today. Thank you.
Yes please keep going, this is good. Tell me more about where they will "price the range" and other entertaining tidbits, and link to more articles completely out of sequence with deal events. FYI companies prefer to price the IPO as highly as possible to minimize share dilution and keep the upside for themselves vs. letting retail run up an underpriced stock, but please tell me more about how it's been "priced" to pop lmao 🤡🤡🤡   I really shouldn't be giving you all these free lessons but this is too entertaining

Im currently holding 1/15/21 Calls, should I sell that before earnings and roll them to March calls? I don’t want the IV to drop on me and then I lose my current profits? does that make sense?

Up about 30% YTD, theta gang. Most people here lose money but not 400K at a time. But sure, if they are losing some, it’s worth thinking if the money could have been better in someone else’s hands.
Like 12/15 and only if they are reasonable IV imo. Too many people expect the tank, including active fund managers that BM to SP and need those shares. Imo they will be waiting in the wings for that dip and may even be sellers on the put contracts on 12/15 knowing they can buy enough to create a floor post inclusion.

It's my best position.

I did screenshot the post at the time and I'll probably repost it soon but it's a shame I didn't save the comments as well

Most American Poor people tend to be short sighted and live their paycheck to paycheck and not invest anything. Or they can’t afford to.
r/wallstreetastrology
Yes cause even long term trades still have selling points. Stock jumps up 500% after a year and you are up 20,000% on your options 99% of long term traders would sell at least most of their contracts. Non retards know that chasing all the money left on the table is how you end up broke and sucking dick for a big Mac. There is a reason 204,000% returns are not the norm and if I have to explain that to you then shit I have some NKLA to sell you.
What the fuck is that thing
How’s AQB looking for Monday
Not sure I fully understand the question. You only lose your shares if the price is above the strike you sold at expiry. If you sell $6 strikes and the price is below $6 at expiry, you never lose your shares and you keep the premium. You also make the profit on the shares for the value gained in share price. If the stock is at $4, you sell covered calls with $6 strike and the stock closes at expiry at $5, you keep your shares, you keep the premium from selling the call and you have the gain of $1 per share as well.

There is going to have to be a huge investment in nickel mining. They don't have enough even for Tesla right now. There is nowhere near enough for every automaker with EV dreams.

I just did my own retarded dd on it by looking at a few charts, read a Yahoo article and then pinched my left nipple twice and I’ve decided I’m yoloing half my portfolio on this. Are you going to wait a bit at open to see which way its trading and if its trading downwards let it find some support and then buy the calls or how you playing that
So if you were to pick a NIO call into the future what would it be? Asking for a friend.
Yeah, but I wear my mask the right way too

It's not that at all, it's that their servers are fragile as fuck and shit goes down on every trading day that's "higher than usual". People lose millions cause their orders don't go through.

There's also "non official but well established" facts that RH orders go through last behind all the real brokerages.

Reading this will make a person more retarted
LMFAO that article is from 11/29 you peasant, before they even came out with a range. They established their range last week on 12/1. They didn't have a range at the time of the article, so WSJ was speculating on their initial range. This is so entertaining that you are linking articles without even know what you're talking about, and misusing words thinking you understand things. The IPO gets priced once, and once only. Please do continue tho, this is entertaining lmao.
Love this hate.
I wish I knew nothing about valuations so I could’ve made this trade too.

You're right. I'm retarded.  And I think it was something else, but gores did Nikola as well, correct?

Either way alot of these spac mergers have been money and follow a predictable trend

Life is a roll of the dice.
Yeah but options don’t allow you to post on social media about how you’re an entrepreneur and tell your loser friends they need to hustle and grind.
Give it to that Nigerian Prince
Don’t be a fucking fool. It’s going to keep climbing until 21st. Price was upgraded to 780
Right, but in order for one side of the contract to be open, the other side does too, so this is being realized for someone.

I agree. Something like Slack is not even hard to create. I wonder what's the overlap % between their users.
If 100 17yo trolls said they had 5000 shares thats 500k shares, meaning we collectively have over 4m shares or roughly 6.1%. Thats still huge.

I'd rather bike for 2 hours than run for 30 minutes. Running sucks.
The high was 60k. Was that your initial deposit + the gains. How much did you actually lose?

I bought TSLA 3/20/20 690 calls in October of last year for $2k and sold for $11k, thought I was a god damn genius 

The position was worth $250k in feb
Two questions,

1) what happens if you hold this until it expires? Do you just end up with like 2,000 shares of tesla? Would it lose you money to do this?

2) would it be hard to sell these as they are right now? What benefit does someone have buying these in their current form?
Any amount would work dumbass.
I'm in with a 1000 shares, but I think I'm going to spend 2 grand to buy puts to hedge my position cause I don't want to lose my shirt. What do you think?

Nothing says "buy and hold" like a company on a 5 year slide whose business model is entirely replaced by the PlayStation store
Tesla had already broken out big time by Q1 2020. The thing was trading at $35 in June 2019 and ripped to $180 in February 2020. At that price, OP was barely in the money and even the overwhelmingly vast majority of degenerate gamblers would have bailed out because there was no discernible reason why it would hold that price. Then, the entire world literally stopped economic output. 

If you think that 500% returns in less than one year is not a breakout, we are definitely in a bubble worse than 2000 and it is really only a matter of time before a complete breakdown of tech valuations.
Thats extra
Or older.

When I was first starting my tool collection, pawn shops and estate sales were extremely handy.  Pawn shops especially this time of year and right after Christmas.  I bought my entire Dewalt 18v (back when 18v first became popular) for under 300$.  None of it looked like it was used more than a few times on home projects.  All of them still work great.
I'm forever grateful that we don't have any of that retarded shit over here
I had other positions that were making similar gains that expired sooner. No reason to trade these as I knew there was catalysts ahead. Also with such a bid gain holding for a year is automatic 20% tax tailwind.

Canoo will have a market cap of ~2.5b. They have 15,000 pre-orders for their bangbus and a deal as EV platform (skateboard) for Hyundai. They will introduce further vehicles throughout 2021 and start delivering in 2022. In the meantime currently they make enough revenue on the side as engineering contractor to stay afloat. That 40% jump was only a matter of time, especially after that presentation at Credit Suisse on Thursday. Most of these EV start ups are garbage, Canoo has so many catalysts coming up, I'm saying it will (rightfully) multiply several times over the next year.
You’re right. I’m an asshole. Please forgive me. I’m sick about losing 400k, but it’s not the end of the world either. It seems like I’m not a good fit for this sub. I won’t post here anymore. Again, I’m sorry. I misread the room obviously.

Uber, the stock at all time highs? Man you’re dumb

Still trying to pick a semantic argument and beat your chest like a big, bad investment banker after making basic errors like saying analysts can’t initiate coverage before an IPO...

But sure if you think it’s so dumb to use the word “pricing” and to say that they’re going to increase their range until the final pricing then you can argue with all the major investor publications that you presumably read:

“Airbnb Inc and DoorDash Inc are revising their enterprise valuation targets for their upcoming initial public offerings next month, according to the Wall Street Journal. **Both the unicorn startups have reportedly upscaled the valuation range by $3 billion each.”** https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-doordash-aim-for-higher-than-expected-valuations-ahead-of-debuts-11606689243?mod=hp_lead_pos4

Oh you forgot they already raised the range once? I guess there’s no demand 🤡 

“Updated Airbnb IPO Filing Sets **Pricing** Range With $35 Billion Valuation” - investors.com

“Airbnb IPO **pricing**, EU squeezes UK in Brexit talks, Brazil's economy during the pandemic” - Financial Times

“Airbnb sets IPO **pricing** terms” - pehub.com

Yup no one calls it pricing 🙄

Were these ITM options at the time of the trade?  And how did you get these so cheap with such a long options contract??

I think they are just saying insiders will choose to keep most of their shares rather than dumping. Probably no source available on either side of the argument.

Fuck you
Once it hits 60, all the people working the fields in NE New Mexico and N Texas (Lubbock) Will go back to making nearly 100k or more year. (Assuming they go back to post Covid production and wages) There is nothing to really do in those areas other than Casinos, Buy big trucks, luxury off road toys, furniture (Beds specifically, but you guys already hyped the mattress stock at the wrong times)

Before I was here, I was in that area selling them Temperpedics at 12k each. Or at least trying to ( I was mediocre at best) but the local economies helped much with that.

But point is, 60 dollar a barrel sets those local economies up for that.

PS, they like their Fs up in that area. Because Texas.

You can’t time the market. All we know is that it goes up over time and even that’s not correct sometimes. There is no get rich quick scheme without luck but if you’re patient you can get rich eventually. But I’m poor so take it for what it’s worth.
They love to see it
That’s cool that they didn’t make enough cars to meet demand. The fact still remains that market share of EVs is still less than 5%. It will absolutely grow. But it’s still something only for early adopters and other manufacturers have years to make the transition.

Few states are locking down, lots of deaths and “cancelled Christmas” but orange man puts his manhood on stock performance so Monday will be super green. You made the right choice.
Hypothetically if this happened to someone else they would need 240,000 already available to them to actually exercise the option and make max gains am I correct? Selling the contracts and not exercising the option would only give you the difference in premiums as profit. Somewhat new want to make sure I’m understanding everything correctly before I actually start with options
I hate you so much...

Dude, we've talked in TIC. That's awesome. 

Me personally if I had that kinda money that's fuck you money. Id seriously consider cashing out a lot of it putting it somewhere more stable. And keep some in Tesla for fun. 2M @4% would net me 80k a year which is nearly double my highest salary. Id never need to work again and could walk away from my job any day I wanted and you still have 3M and that's using your 5M
I Dont need to know your business. 

I put most of my account in Tesla shares in August after the split was announced made big returns in 2 weeks, enough to eliminate my losses. Cashed out to realize gains/offset realized losses and then put the money back. Added a few options and most of my Roth. Made 50% since reinvesting. Mid Nov I bought some June 2021 420c and a Jan 2023 $600C things are looking pretty good right now.
why do people think it can't go below 20?

 Not entirely. This has protected the big drillers from themselves. Their normal mindset is drill baby drill, but if they are not allowed to, it will tighten up the oil demand. This should push the price of a barrel to $50-60.

Okay story time. So I’ve started learning golf recently and I was just practicing my swing at the range today. There was some old man right next to me, and two smoking hot chicks next to him. After my session, I go up to one of the chicks (they’re sisters) and chat her up. As soon as I ask for her number, she looks up to the old man, blushes, and says he’s her father. The mf looks at me and goes, “I would have allowed her to go on a date with you if you could stop flailing the club around and hit the ball correctly.” They both started laughing and I’m standing there with my dick in my hand.

I worked with a guy about 15 years ago who had a knack for falling for get rich quick schemes. When I left that place him and his wife had just dumped a bunch of money (I think it was like $4k) into this forex training program or mentorship of whatever the hell you want to call it. Pretty sure he was just supposed to make the trades they suggested using their website. My guess is in the end he was out a lot more than 4k.
How did it feel when you went from 2.5mil to like 300k in a week?
For ATHs, I always use either the daily or weekly.

Didn't know there were studies that automatically did this. I assume they aren't always accurate.

Thoughts on Bloomberg?
Dude. You’re insufferable.

For every hot area you’ve mentioned there’s a better company positioned to eat Intel’s lunch.

Intel was THE cpu company. That’s no longer true so now they’re saying “well, we’re going to do something else!”

They have all of these plans and they’re presenting lots of promise but if you look at what they’ve actually accomplished I would be incredibly worried.

From your posts it’s clear you don’t work in this industry, you read press releases and make smart financial trades.

I don’t think your options play is a bad idea. You’ll likely make money. 

When you start talking technicals when it’s clear you have no idea what you’re talking about.

I’m a Master’s student at a top 5 university. 1/3 of intel’s fab PhDs come from my school, their starting salary is $250,000. I was offered a job at Intel my junior year. I turned them down.

Intel has a horrific work culture, it’s bureaucratic and inefficient and they want to compete against do-or-die startups? 

People are bringing up AMD NOT because they think AMD will kill Intel. They do it because AMD was a joke for 20 years and now Intel lost their core competency to them in the course of a few years.

The Roman Empire didn’t fall because of some disorganized Germanic barbarians, but the fact that the Romans couldn’t handle disorganized Germanic barbarians was clear indication the empire was in a weak position.
I hope you listened, made up all I lost in one day! Canoo $HC-AC is the next move

I think even WSB agrees that everybody should stay away from Forex.
Based on what I read, in the short term nickel will help them increase the energy density, but the long term addressable reserves aren't enough to make enough nickel if every car in the world became electric. Is there any solution to this? Maybe SpaceX will mine asteroids for metals lol, that would be 3D chess on Elon's part.
I do the same shit lmao. Years later though😔 pathetic
How did you not sell this a long time ago? I start getting anxiety when I'm at like 1000% and here you are still holding at 200000% lol

Why wouldn’t they have more than before the pandemic? The pandemic created a great opportunity to make money that most of us took advantage of. I’m poor, and I did great because of the pandemic.

They didn't price anything clown, you don't even know the nomenclature that you are using.

If you're talking about Arrival, I agree with you and it's one of the few EVs that I have a lot of LT confidence in... Again, if we are discussing the same company, the talent on their LinkedIn is downright impressive. Their engineers (including software) are the real deal and they've attracted the best and the brightest. On a conceptual level, I really dig the micro-factories as well. Keeping CapX low and remaining agile from a production standpoint will be a key market advantage moving forward.

Unbelievable
Yes, this isn't gamblers anonymous. As much as we joke around about losses we do actually try not to lose money, so it's kind of sad that you're super sunny about losing a massive amount and don't seem to have taken it as a sign that you should learn more about options before trading them again.

I mean fuck, I'll take your money, but when you're sitting there flippantly telling people *"I make too much f-ing money to lose it all. It’s too hard to keep up."*, *"I’m not risking anything that I need or that Would change my lifestyle if I lost it."* then it just sounds like you're aimlessly gambling.

And saying things like *"I’m not here to help you start a business.* ***I’m here to help you invest."*** is really stupid when you're just about the worst investor around here and don't seem to have any desire to get better.

I've lost bigger amounts than most people from time to time but I learn from my mistakes and I would hope most other people would try to as well.

Congratulations. But I must ask what your logic was for holding for so long? Since 2019 I’m sure you read endless reports of Tesla being overvalued, not selling nearly enough cars compared to its competitors, all the dips etc. Not asking in a condescending way, genuinely curious to your thought process. This single trade alone could be studied for behavioral finance lol..... I mean at ANY point among the way you could have taken a lot of profits, so did you just have a much higher price target than anyone else?....Tia!

I’ve never been given a cookie after selling a covered call.
Someone did the math and said WSB owns 5% of GME. I didn’t check the math.
That would be the worst move ever. Basically turning Tesla into a bank lol.
Now is the time to enter ... it’s not going lower
If you want to keep skin in the game but de-risk, sell your options before earnings and replace them with shares. If there’s a drop after earnings you lose less total % value compared to your calls, but if it decides to moon you’re still onboard instead of missing out entirely.

If it stagnates after earnings replace those exchanged shares for later dated calls for Q4 after IV settles.
If you're asking here you know the answer.
That's the health play right
Nah you are good. It’ll hit 30 once the volatility from people selling off ends.
Ahh yes him and his 7+ quadrillion dollars worth of shares.
Purchase a high end automobile company with manufacturing and supply chain expertise. I also think that people have not considered the nickel problem enough. For instance while VALE mines nickel, it makes most of its profit from iron ore (which btw is selling at a premium. Also China is buying it as fast as it's mined), and therefore it doesn't make sense for VALE to invest the money to transition away from that right now. Getting VALE to mine more nickel in the near future will require a HUGE sum of money. Tesla has that.
I bought 9 bro, but I’m mostly too much of a degenerate for shares.

GME guidance is going to be through the roof
I like anything from 75-80, but 80 will be the most profitable from a % basis if it gets past $82. I might pick up some 77.50 and 75 calls just for the delta and sell out a bit earlier to lower risk tolerance, but I’m pretty confident that these should print within 8 days of trading(sell after Moderna news).
Yea it's totally an average iq play

It doesn't get much more lottery tickety than the play you made.  The same play on almost any other stock would be worthless.

Step one to getting rich - use someone else’s money
Right, at the per stock price based on the warrant, or cashless if that is what happens, at whatever ratio it ends up being.  If a fixed ratio caps leverage in gains then the appreciation of warrant value tracks stock at 1-1.
Whatever you have left put it on That BEV company that for some Reason I have no IDEA what its called ... they have loads of catalysts lined up for 2021.
Should be able to get a good return on leaps

This is not financial advice this is a shit post.
Yeah man. I'll stick with GME, seems like a blue chip stock.
Lol they did price something, the initial range, just like I said clearly. You’re trying to create a semantic argument over nothing to distract from the mistakes you made upthread.

Of course I understand how building an IPO order book works. I’ve also watched Airbnb for many years and I know both the hype to buy from investors and that the IPO is intentionally priced for a pop. Chesky is a perfectionist and waited a long time to get it right.

You probably thought DoorDash wasn’t going to raise their range too. That’s a much shittier company but even that was predictable if you were paying attention.

Can’t wait for you to pretend you weren’t wrong when they price above the range this week. You’re the sort of pro investment banker that will wait for Goldman to tell you to buy at $100 after their lockup is over. But you can trust them because they’re “affiliated”
In the brokerage. Fidelity says specifically 401k doesn’t count. I was wondering about IRA.

This is my town exactly, the only big box stores that carry very mild pc parts are Walmart and best buy. There is a very small pc specialty shop but they're only open four hours a day four days a week. But if the local gamestop carried pc parts I would have much rather gone there and had my pc upgrade done in an afternoon rather than waiting a week for all the parts I ordered online to get to me.

No way, the original DD that he copied seemed to be from a competent person, you just really should be looking at post histories of people - this kid is a pump n dumper, he was posting about SeeeEars (why is this ticker banned?). This spac is still under 11 and the company they are merging with is not the same as rocket and even have earnings unlike lazr. Seems like a good bet

Yeah to me it sounds like you’re doing the right thing.  I don’t think there is anything wrong with hiding that from her.. just tell her when you’re ready and comfortable with her knowing. If I were her the only reason why I would be upset is because I would feel like you didn’t trust me. But I would also understand the concerns
This is the way

Yep, as awesome as Tesla's run is, it is ridiculously overvalued by every fucking financial metric to evaluate a company possible. They JUST turned their first profitable quarter this year. And as of yesterday, it's trading 1191x price-to-earnings. The price is completely driven by hype and it's absolutely ignorant to say anything otherwise. Tesla winnings are all luck that the hype doesn't fizzle out.
Oh la la .. thanks 🙏 a million . Ready for Cobra Kalls - your user name checks out and do some magic - my user name .. winning combo bro

Imagine being on the other side of this trade.
I mean, it's trading for $10.62 per share. Considering that SPACs have a NAV floor of about $10, how far can it really drop? This seems like a low-risk (albeit opportunity cost) play to me.
Can't find it. CAn you link?

I have several ITM calls that expire 2022 , I will just stick to what you did, and let the patience do the trading.

I’m not holding them for long-term or anything. Already up about 20% on them when I bought on Thursday. I’ll likely sell them on monday

LGVW, the ticker will switch to BFLY when the merger completes early 2021! As long as you buy lgvw, when the ticker changes to bfly you will still have the shares. Hope that helps
I bought a lightweight Makita drill recently. Sold as a combo with impact driver. So light and small and the drill bits are easy to access and use
sure maybe if all the other issues were resolved.

if everything goes back to the way it was and cost of goods dont go up due to devaluing of the dollar.

the way I look at it is,

07-08 stimulus possible lead to the new highs we had for that run.

19-20 stimulus possibly the cause for the run up from the crash to where its at now.

The next run up, will come once everything has resolved.

However, theres still a lot of moving parts that may or may not have been factored in yet.
So many options.

I’ll just take this as some sort of compliment, hah.

Tesla is sitting on a humongous moat of cash relative to earnings. The entire world is watching to see what it does with this cash. What specific things do you think they can do with it? (Not vague generalities like hurr durr batteries)
Good luck. Women love spending money and especially YOUR money
Sell 75% after tesla run up on 12/21. 12/22. Used that cash and sell cash secure puts and make a healthy monthly income. You can use those income to make some yolo.

GRAPEVINE, Texas , Nov. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) , today announced that it will report third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings results after the market closes on Tuesday, December 8, 2020 . The company will host an investor conference call at 5:00 pm ET on the same day to...
Technically the money I already lost I borrowed past-me's time and spent present-me's money.

That's kind of gambling with a loan anyways already, right?
You literally have no idea how the capital markets work or the process of building an IPO order book, and thus you have a false sense of comfort / security with this deal. They didn't "price the range for a pop" (for your edification, they haven't priced anything yet, they went out with a preliminary range). It's basically a flat round to their last valuation of \~$31 billion, which even a flat round is an aggressive upward stretch for them, and it doesn't exactly invite a lot of confidence in the potential aftermarket performance of the stock (that means when it becomes available to retarded retail traders like yourself). They went out with this range knowing investors will push back, and they'll land somewhere in between. You even talking to me about this is like if I were to try to convince a PhD in chemistry about how his lab formulas are wrong. I can't wait for the markets to bend you over and you get stuck with a massive bag. Happy YOLOing retard!
Fuck it I’m putting 500 in some way OTM PLTR leaps. See you on the edge of the universe, retard.

Congrats! :)
Actually they aren’t making any interest off of you, the broker takes that. You don’t sell and then buy back the same exact stock, but just a general one at 2 different prices. The difference in that is partially realized through the person you sold it to and the person you buy it from.
Sounds like you have the wrong women

Lmao touche, its shitpost Saturday tho
Guaranteed the drop happens. But none of us have Michael Burry money or balls of steel to hold the line long enough to pay off. 

-Interest rates go up
-Elon keeps missing/breaking promises
-Mounting QC issues turn off more US buyers
-People figure out the energy division is going backwards
-Tesla can't figure how to maintain profitability without gov't credits 
-Competitors deliver more affordable EV cars with better construction in late 2021
-Elon fucks up his autism meds again and goes off on twitter
-It becomes public that robo taxi was just a lie to get Tesla a massive injection of capital to survive the 2 quarters where tesla nearly went insolvent.

Any of the above either happen or become common knowledge (for those that are already happened) to the ~70% of retail investors that keep Tesla's valuation pumped.... The streets will run red with blood
I don't know if you noticed, but there was a pandemic that started back in February/March and the idea that a luxury electric vehicle company was going to just bounce up 729% for no real particular reason was and remains pretty far-fetched.

During that drop, it is almost a guarantee that OP watched his gains drop from a few hundred percent down to negative. This is not even a sustainable gambling strategy. If it is, OP can turn his $5M into $10B on his next trade.

If that happens, I will take everything I have said back and subscribe immediately to his Discord.

Tesla will be studied as an example of the 2020/21 stock mania. Just like other companies in 1999/2000. Economy students will dissect tweets such as "stock price too high". Michael Burry will lose millions on his short. Its in a fucking mega bubble of its own but id still never dare to short it.

GME shareholders - Are you guys/girls selling on Monday/Tuesday pre-earnings and re-buying the potential dip, or are you holding through earnings and hope it shoots up? 

Not too sure what the play should be.
The price is still too high to justify the amount of risk we're taking on. A 50c 1/22/22 is 4.6. It could go anywhere, trade sideways for a year without a catalyst.
There’s a pretty good chance both of these things happen

No. Account is 279 days old. It is a shill account. Why do you guys constantly fall for this shit?
The right way is to have a large account and sell puts on margin
Buying OTM leaps on a stock like Tesla that has breakout potential, when it’s been beaten down temporarily..isn’t that wild to imagine. Majority of people would have sold after a few 100% gain that’s why patience is the major factor here, not necessarily luck. Everyone experiences luck when they win on the option, not everyone has bulletproof patience and discipline.
Get used to saying “would you like fries with that”
It’s a mature business. Throwing cash at it wouldn’t make it grow any faster.

As long as it is above cost basis, that person or firm is about to book like a 300% gain on shares.

Even if the gains are capped, 300% is not exactly a bad return on capital.

I hope my stocks go up and yours as well so long as your positions do not conflict w mine
I have a client who called them two months ago and he showed me a 25k gain in options. He says it has room to grow to 20 so I'm inclined to believe him now

All I know about forex is a documentary I watched, and everyone looked unbelievably stressed out. Just buy more PLTR
"We will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense. We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business."

Sure sounds like AMC is going to demand that Warner compensate them for not showing movies in their theaters. So that would be AMC's only other form of leverage. Not that it would play out well at all. Should be interesting, though.
Right, time to back the truck up. Only 37c a share...

True. I haven't looked at the numbers lately but I have to assume the debt and pension obligations are manageable? Additionally picking up the workforce almost guarantees that your company is TBTF and will receive government handouts into perpetutiy....just as we enter a 10 year period where its expected that the government's around the world are prepared to break open the bank and spend to infinity.
You have $700 left, what do you mean you can't get it back.
Bought cheap OTM calls (2-4 months exps) on SRTY for this exact reason. If the position goes to zero, who cares because it's a cheap insurance policy for my portfolio. If shit hits the fan, the Russell will tank hard and the 3x leveraged timebomb that is SRTY will explode upwards.

LAZR CRUISING TO ANTARCTICA   📷 📷
Each currency has a pair. For example, the US Dollar can pair with the Euro to make a EURUSD. This is called a currency pair. Basically, it’s how much one currency costs using another currency. So if the EURUSD is trading at say $1.2505, then you can buy 1 Euro for the cost of $1.2505 Us Dollars. The goal is to either buy the Euro with hopes that the price will increase so you can sell at a profit, or sell the Euro with hopes that the price will decrease so you can buy it back at a lower price for a profit. Much like Calls and Puts. 

Forex is risky because of the leverage and volatility. People often blow their accounts because they use too much leverage, improper lot sizes (how many units of currency), underestimate the volatility, and don’t use proper risk/reward ratios. a 50pip SL should have a 150pip TP. 

It takes a long time to understand the markets fully and each currency pair trades different, much like how TSLA trades differently than GME or SPY. 

Hope this helps.

u/oben_yalfan Sorry I commented on the wrong post. Hope this helps

Im a retarded option trader, but can someone help me out? 

But it was either late 2018 or 2019 but I was thinking about putting 1k or 2k buying the latest possible calls at the highest possible strike price. Would i be a millionaire if I would of done it and held through now. 

If so that’s sad. I remember my finger was on the review screen and decided not too.
Holyshit dude, that's insane... I really need to start playing with options, stock trading is shitty when you don't have a sufficient capital.
OP can prove the two of us dead wrong by turning his $5M into $10B on his next trade.

Something tells me that isn't going to be the outcome next time around.
Rumor says ZM added to S&P500 will be announced soon
If you want to go balls deep aggressive go TQQQ / ARKG
If you don’t simp for tasty trades, you are not going to have fun there
Whats the difference between theta gang and selling plasma
Two ARKK $125 March 21 calls.
This isn’t what we do here
I believe that deep ITM options are mostly intrinsic value and little extrinsic value, so time decay would be negligible. It's all delta at this point.

Now what he could have done to make (a lot) more money would have been to continually roll out his options to higher strikes as TSLA went up. Of course this also adds risk too, but you'll make more this way if the stock goes in your favor.
So TRNE for the next meme? They have call vote on 8th, and ticker change on 10th. Does WSB have the meme power for a second load, or this just a one pump chump

I know they did some bad things lately but i like if for the free commission and never had any problem. I don't use automatic stop/loss cause It fucks you up everytime. I sell manually... IBKR man its a headache to create and fund your account. I Will Stick with trading 212 and my bank too

For the love of God people. If you feel like shit is over bought use trailing stops. You can still capitalize on the gains. Just be cautious. 

Take me for example. I did not use trailing stops in 2018 and I saw 120,000 in profits disappear. And quickly. Trailing stops would have saved my ass. I use them all the time now.

there’s a right way and a wrong way to do thetagang

Wrong way: have 20k-40k and chase shit meme stocks and premium and probably get assigned within a month and now you’re bag holding something awful. Yay!

Right way: actually have some fucking money and write csps on good companies when they dip to collect premium and worst case you’re “bagholding” something legit that will come back soon enough.

The high pre-covid is irrelevant to the potential highs now

The monetary base has expanded 40% due to excessive money printing by the fed, which has contributed to substantial asset inflation. When we get back to the economy firing on all cylinders the highs will be much higher than pre-covid
damn whats that 100k investment worth rn tho
10/10 would smash all three people you named
I think I know what I'm doing, but I have no idea why it's working so well.
Don’t be like that
It was a gamble of $460. The odds of this outcome are pretty difficult to calculate, but it is practically 0. 

Think about it. If this were as easy as just buying idiotically out of the money call options on meme stocks, there would be a shitload more Lamborghinis on the road.
Obviously you have no idea how the capital markets work if you think ABNB going out at above the range is a foregone conclusion. They did a very defensive roadshow which was focused on their "resilience" in light of all their recent challenges -- not a good look. I wouldn't be surprised to see them price at the low end of the range, similar to Uber last summer which faced similar regulatory risk and a very toppy valuation range before the roadshow. Investors can smell blood from a mile away, clown. Also you are a clown if you think anyone on the sellside or buyside even **acknowledges** non affiliated equity research. It literally doesn't exist to any serious buyside investor. It doesn't show up in research portals on the sellside... The only analysts that matter are the ones covering the company, that's who the buyside looks to when making investment decisions, and they can't publish yet. 

Please stand down retail clown. Thx!
And now you're back to saying he did sell...Fucking A man your about as straight as a gay pride parade.

Could work. Did you enter already? I also like the idea of the (reverse) vol dispersion trade too, but only in theory. Many clever people tend to overthink volatility trades. Take it from an overthinker in a previous life...

I much more liked the idea of being long vol/gamma to the upside a few weeks ago and that paid off much, much more than betting on an IV change. I sold out of near-dated calls right after the SP500 news and just turned June 440s into spreads locking in \~$20000 a piece. I also locked the value of some March/June short 430Ps.

(With all the beginner questions I am seeing, I would not be surprised if I win the OCC lotto and am assigned on my short calls months in advance...)

At this point \*if\* I do anything with TSLA in the next two weeks, it will be spamming 650c or 700c weeklies or 650/700 verticals. not trade advice, just giving my mindset. I may gamble on a downside move after inclusion, but I think that may turn into a crowded trade.
Save you the work. The poll would be 99% buy options 1% being a bitch
If there's one thing I know about Americans, it's that they all fall in line and do exactly what everyone else is doing /s
If I could go back to two moments in history, it would be 1) to see Natasha Bedingfield in-person writing Pocketful of Sunshine and 2) to see Buffet's face when Elon Musk raised millions (possibly billions) from the issuance of $69.420 red short shorts.
Thanks for the heads up.

This is true they can consider you a day trader if your trading volume is that high. It’s a grey area but any position that was held “under 3 months” can be considered to be sus to them. From what I’ve researched they look at; trade frequency, profession, how much time you spend on research to determine if you’re a “professional” trader and therefore earn business income rather than tax free (TFSA) gains. They purposely are vague about the hard limits on any of this I would assume to reserve the right to fuck you if you banked hard. However if your tfsa is under 1mill it’s unlikely that they try to squeeze more tax out of you, they got bigger paydays to chase. This is why all my options are in non reg accounts but all longs are in TFSA/RRSP.

If the second $1200 stimmy check hit your account Monday morning what options are you buying?
Buy a 1/15/21 call debit spread with 590/600 strikes. 

Sell a 1/15/21 put credit spread with 500/490 strikes. 

Max loss is 1177 if TSLA drops to 490. Max profit is 833 (1000-177) if TSLA goes to 600.

Sell out when the credit spread drops 50% in value, so when you can buy it back for $88-89.
i took my loss and moved on. simply unfathomable price action
Christ I didn't even mention their speakers, you're absolutely right. They get the most famous (non actor though sometimes actors) people in the world as you said.

Maybe you should have bought more you only have 79 shares of a stock that Was under 10 bucks.....if you were so convinced you should have bought a thousand shares on margin when it was 7 bucks and you would have made 3 grand. Also I have 1 share I bought when it was 2.50 and I wish I had done the same thing:(

Risk absolutely does not mean it will go big green after big red. Risk means a few of your stocks will stay forever red, and a few might go big green, but you don't know which, and just because one is red now doesn't mean it will always be red, and just because one is green now doesn't mean it will always be green.

Very true but the 400/500 feels pretty safe
Isn’t that what I said in my post? If you read it as something else.. my apologies.
Wow this makes me sick to my stomach :/
That’s some serious hedging. It’ll certainly hit one of these days.
Probably nowhere. It’s meant to be a slow growth stock. Playing weeklies on this is just not smart
Amazing. My sincerely congrats
i’m successful enough to whip out my portfolio and 80% of ppl have to shut up lmao this is great for the ego
I feel pity for the guy who sold these options. He better has 2000 TSLA shares to cover his ass. And all the trouble he only made $460 in premiums lmao
Do yourself a favor and search Trading 212 in this Autist ballpark - you will find plenty of examples where they are fucking up peoples assets - don’t use it. You can also trade CFD on Interactive Brokers if you’re a Eurotard - these guys are legit and won’t fish your stops. Thank me later.
nah, just learn the lesson: patience.

Keep getting terrible information bud. I love having people that have no fucking clue what they are talking about being available to sell me calls.
Were you already rich?
Got greedy. Tried to scalp on GME Monday morning but held too long. Saw the market was in a nose-dive and checked DXY to see that it had risen ~0.5% in the span of an hour. Figured I could turn it around on SPY puts, completely forgetting that 360 was a massive support. Took the rest of my money and put it back into TSLA where I had made most of my gains. That night Burry announced he’s shorting TSLA and the Elon email was leaked. TSLA crashes the next day. I had also put some of my money on SOL where I had made a lot of gains, but forgot their ER was that day and I didn’t have any day-trades left to sell my new positions. 

Pretty much got greedy, fucked up, tried to recover with a risky play, fucked up harder, tried to go back to my safe haven stocks, got obliterated. Ironically I sold my TSLA calls at the perfect time on Monday morning, and if I had stayed cash until Thursday I could’ve bought back in then and tripled my money.
Where the fuck is PLTR heading next week?
I know but I don't know why there is even a hint of a possibility of delisting being spread.
Oh lovely <3 My personal favorite is "Game of Trades", dudes balls have not dropped yet and he is selling courses. That rabbit hole is bottomless and boomers still like gold bugs  like Peter Schiff or some old gen WSB players like Martin Armstrong who gets hedge manager of the year award and makes legendary losses next year and gets go to jail card.  


There is couple good ones like Patric Boyle. He doesn't give any trade tips but opens door to real trading world and yes, he has license(always check that :D). I kinda like Trading Rush channel too where this robot test different trading strategies. At least you can drop worst ones off.

Same as any other market. Buy low, sell high. Sell high, buy low. Use leverage to amplify gains and losses. Currencies are valued and traded against each other. You pick a pair, say the dollar and euro, and trade them, trying to predict price movements against each other. Dollar weakens? Now your euros are worth more. Sell them and buy dollars, hoping the dollar will rally.

Obviously irregularities occur when you are organizing and executing an election to 300 million people with a gutted USPS system Under Trump, with a Trump appointment at the top no less. But a vast conspiracy? 

Hundreds or maybe thousands idiots vote twice across party lines across the country. There are videos of Trump supporters saying they do.

It seems like of this was true at a large scale, wouldn't you have hundreds and hundreds of witnesses coming out saying they saw this. It would require some vast conspiracy. 

The best witnesses they can come up with seem more mentally ill then credible. 

Do you think Bush planned 9/11 or shit like that too?
So I'm still trying to figure out how calls work...copying some math from another comment: "Well he paid $0.23 per option contract last year. He has 20 contracts. 1 contract covers 100 shares. So the math is: **20 x ( 100 x $0.23) = $460"**

Was this really just a gamble of $460 if the calls expired worthless, or would he still be on the hook in some way for the full share price?
Yea, when the CRA gives a shit they'll make a stink about it, they did a bit when there was a new guy making a million a year in their TFSAs every week getting to the press, but I haven't heard anything about it recently so they may have cooled off a bit.
It really is a rush like I’ve never experienced before. 

Went from 500 -> 3k playing long options

Then went all in on 11/20 Tesla FD calls when they were around 410 only to sell for -75%. This was 2 trading days before 500 announcement. Went from complete euphoria to utter shambles.
Do you have the downloaded software? It shows ytd PL up top. But I haven’t figured out positional gains. You can always log into tastyworks.com for a portfolio check. I barely know how to use their software but I’m up 50k ytd so whatever.

Ummm maybe BPs established infrastructure might be a good way to mass rollout charging stations? Orrrrr perhaps their big investments in green energy might complement Tesla's. Orrr... maybe the adoption rate of EV wont be nearly as smooth as currently projected and diversifying into other spaces will buoy the company valuation? Or...theres 500 billion reasons something like this needs to happen.

Ross is actually dank recently he’s been doing a load of live trading sessions. He’s also up $4 mil on the year day trading and streams premarket and then a recap for free every day.
Holding through earnings but if I see a flash crash, I will probably sell to buy back in when it settles. It’ll probably end up being a fake flash crash and come right back out and I’ll get shaken out like a weak handed idiot, though.
I miss all the ptlr posts....
Yea Canada is pretty shit if you want to trade
Tesla gonna run this week or what?
If I’m reading the graph right, you’d open positions that would generate returns for a brief amount of time (weeklies probably) but for some reason you’d hold on to them past the pop until expiry? And you’ve repeated this 3 times before going bust the first time, then reloaded 5 more times trying the same strategy, before this last time. You’re buying power says that you’re still holding on to the same options, aka letting your $700 go to zero. Am I missing something?

Chances he pays out is similar to the chances Donnie gets 4 more years. But other dude would keep his word
Yeah but if it gets to like $750 before then. Will it just drop to 650? Lol any call bought now will still be up.
You sound like a fucking bitch
That time of the year where everyone is about to ask for tax advice
200,000% is better. It's more rare but should do 1mil with it. You hit a sweet jackpot there. Congrats. I like how you played the game on that one. Reward through the roof.

Only one of us said something that is demonstrably 
false in this conversation and it was you. You claimed no analysts could initiate coverage until after the IPO and then after I linked coverage on Airbnb you started backtracking and acting rude and condescending

Learn to be wrong gracefully instead of bragging about being an investment banker who doesn’t know IPO rules. No one comes here to see you pound your chest after you’re wrong.

We get it pre-IPO coverage is rare so you didn’t know. No worries. Airbnb to $75. Enjoy the tendies

I bought 100 shares at about 16.3 and 5 call contracts that you can check on the second slide of the post. Should I buy more stocks?
You mean the corporation that longs and shorts the same stock at the same time? Count me in!
[This is the only screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/mPErxlM) I could find from back when I had that account. I was using lot sizes around 5-10 lots with an account less than $10k. That’s not recommended with proper risk management. Using 2% risk and 50pip SL, an account that’s about $150k should be using 6 lots per trade. Not an account with $1000. It’s all good fun though

I mean, a breakout is 60% in a year.

You needed 200% annual returns to even hit break even, let alone go in the money. 

I am happy for you, man. I think it is awesome that you turned a few hundred bucks into $5M, but if you are thinking this is anything more than absolute dumb luck, you are going to lose this money as fast as you made it.
Yeah, fuk em, cause if you win they want some and if you lose then fuk u right! Truetough can suck it
Lol thats part of why they wanted to make loan recipients secret when the bill passed
Corona allows u to take out $100k from retirement penalty free one time before December 31. I am planing on selling and cashing out that much around Tesla s&p inclusion. Big boys won’t let average Joe etf owner profit like us idiots.

Did you ask her bf for permission?
I know you drank a fuck ton tonight but be safe driving home!!
No. Fuck you, too.
If you are planning to use your TFSA, I would say go in on Canadian stocks, I like oil stocks like VET and air Canada is always a good bet
I would believe anonymous 4chan trolls over CNN any day but luckily I have background in statistics which is why this obvious fraud is so damned obvious. A media that was genuinely independent would investigate and a judiciary that genuinely wanted to uphold the law would want to see the evidence before deciding

I know ATT isn't a growth stock by its a reasonable goal and they're dirt cheap contracts.

Yolo'ing it would be dumb but the risk is so low I'm not worried one way or another.

Rwt is probably a good bet tho.

Oh wait that expires on the 18? Wtf. Well no not a good bet. If it was like a year from now. Stop buying short dated call options.
you sir, are incorrect. Not the first gain post seen here from tsla OTM options purchased last spring.
Look at my post history on PLTR. I'm not a bear here. But to claim he didn't sell is retarded. Go read the form 4. It's literally says it.

Coolest thing I have seen today! How much did it cost?
But the point was it never reaches 600 (for all those sell limits to trigger) so what is being selled before that?

So how does a split work an option contract? Does the strike price also get divided?
Legal or not, I plan on doing this
You should try to get in on that action if the bet wasn’t with you.

Look at an option chain for any stock and tell me where the option to trade any contract with strikes 3x the price of the stock 1.5 years out exist. Especially Tesla for 23 cents a share in 2019.
Lol, I'd take that and sell hella ITM spreads
Nice 👍🏾
Moderna is for the rural cities since it doesnt need the crazy refrigeration
Feel retarded? I know someone who bet 50k yesterday that trump will be president January 21st
Yeah if somebody is so good at trading why would they need to be charging for courses. What kind of pro trader needs to teach on the side
It was on the 2nd so the damage was done then. Given PLTR volume it's not a huge deal.   


The old saying goes: " insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise."

In the span of three weeks I went from up 3,000% to down 99%. Now the last of my money is in FCEL hoping it’ll go retarded again, then I’m going all in on SPY calls
👏
are there stories of people actually doing that here? that's fucking desperate
Well amazing you claimed it was illegal for analysts to give a price target before IPO then. Now you’ve backtracked and it’s only affiliated analysts that can’t as if anyone cares what Goldman says about their own IPO client. You’ve been brainwashed to think independent analysts are worse. Meanwhile in accounting everyone knows you want an independent auditor.

Lots of people work at investment banks. Doesn’t mean they make money on IPOs. And apparently doesn’t mean they know it’s legal for an analyst to initiate coverage before an IPO.

But at least you learned something even if you won’t admit it
I’m sure zero 17yo trolls said “5000 shares”.

Zero.
You need to pi hole your pi hole to do that
I'll link it here later today. Swarmed by kids right now. It's not a hard fast rule, more like there are 6 considerations, and that is one of them. I.e. they e structured it to be loose so they can apply it where they see fit.   
  
I.e. They will only come after frequent traders who actually made money
572,399.42
That makes sense. I’m in with you. It’s at .60 now but I have $600 to spare. That would be 1/3 of the profits from your projections right?
😎
People with an ounce of sense dont let options run up 200k %.

Whatever this dude ends up doing let him do it, he's obviously better than us

Palantir did a DPO. They didn't issue new stocks like in an IPO. So if the public want shares to buy and sell (prices movement), the founders have to release some shares to the public  early.
The "hype market" trend is just a series of PnD's that were rebranded, right?
A bunch of more rewarding tickers in that field.
Thank you for the translation into WSBese.

Low price and low PE=/= a great investment. Companies fail. I shouldn’t buy a $5 shitty tops football card bc it’s cheap. Jesus

Selling my $370 calls at open and dumping it all into SPCE $30 weeklies
You don’t even have to disappear if the market is good. As long as nobody is withdrawing, just keep sending them statements saying they’re getting richer. If one guy wants to withdraw, you give him some other guy’s money. Only problem happens when the market tanks and everyone wants their money at once. Bernie Madoff might still be running his scam today if the financial crisis didn’t happen
He wont
You’re the reason for my shit post lol

I am the religious right. At least, personally. Religion’s only real problem is forgetting that everyone else gets to live however the fuck they think is best too. And all religious people are really called to do is love those people where they are, as they are. It should really be that simple. 

And to yolo 0dte spy calls of course.
They were pre-split so divide by whatever it was.
lol actually almost certainly too early 

bears will eat soon. The higher we go, the bigger the bear feast
This. I'm happy for OP but obviously this trade simply made no sense. He likely purchased these just because they were cheap and not because there was any backing of logical analysis. This is nothing but pure luck. 

Congrats op! You won the lottery!

I’d bet 12/18 is a really bad day for all options. Quadruple witching expiration day

They do become magically undervalued because most investors are bad at math. This is how you make profits. You find deals and take advantage of the deals. If there was nothing undervalued, there would be no reason to invest.
I try to buy mostly Canadian stocks now my TFSA, except for GME, all my other stocks are traded in TSX

“Tom Brady’s company TB12 received more than $960,000 PPP loan”

Problem is why would Amazon or Netflix want to own all these theatres that they can't do shit with or make money on for months? Maybe ever? Better to let vaccines make progress and AMC get destroyed for awhile and buy later at a cheaper price (if they want them at all).

Fun fact: movie theatres became a thing because they were the first air conditioned public spaces. Hence summer blockbusters; people would go just to cool-off, especially in big cities.
Weeklies deep ITM are cheaper than far OTM calls these days. 
The premiums these days are confusing.
Haha as if retail doesn’t pay attention to price targets on a brand new IPO

You really think people trust the affiliated banks more? What a joke. They have a huge conflict of interest unlike Atlantic Equities

Pre-IPO coverage is rare which is why it’s so bullish. Wake up

You only read American business news and you don’t realize Atlantic Equities is a major London based analyst that isn’t an affiliated party underwriting the US IPO because they’re not even in the US and they’re not an underwriter!

The three best strategies for a leveraged portfolio are 1) selling put credit spreads on NASDAQ 100 companies that dip 5%, sell 5-10% OTM dated a few weeks out, buy back the contracts when you have collected about 50% of the premium. 2) Leaps on high growth stocks or companies that are expected to increase revenue over a few quarters - your memes and companies like aapl. 3) TQQQ.

I do. I just estimate how much I lose/make. No need to know exactly how much I make/lose. For example I used $650 to purchase a new phone with my tendies and have another $700 that i didnt account for just chill in in my WSB checking. Life is easier when you estimate.

Well he paid $0.23 per option contract last year. He has 20 contracts. 1 contract covers 100 shares. So the math is:     **20 x ( 100 x $0.23)   =   $460**

Imagine thinking anyone gives a shit or even knows about Atlantic Equities, whoever the fuck they are. The only price targets that will move a stock are from analysts covering the IPO. They will be in a quiet period for \~30 days after the IPO. You can see yourself out this way -->
Lotta people were waiting to load up on RKT under 20, I wouldn’t be surprised if it gets pushed down for another day or so, but you should hold those fuckers.  We’re likely to see some big buying come in at these levels.

My issue with 1/15 is that we have no idea what Trump is going to do when Biden takes office. I also don't know how fast Biden's policies will move the market. I definitely consider February safer.

Thanks for the longer-term perspective. BCRX wasn't on my radar until early November, and I haven't known quite what to make of the price action over the past while. I guess the one thing that's been clear since I opened my position is that the price has been suppressed, and as you say, market cap is way below fair value compared to other biotechs. I'm imagining that we'll get updated price targets next week and (hopefully) good results from the conference this week.

Yes the banks who work on the IPO can’t cover it because it’s a conflict of interest. But what you said is 100% wrong. And you were rude, you retard.

You said analysts can’t release price targets before IPO. We weren’t talking about the banks working to underwrite the IPO.

I wasn’t expecting this but they were cheap and I knew Tesla would break out eventually. You dont understand options if you think this was a lottery ticket. If I can buy something for practically free that has a decent chance of being worth something.  Also there were not my only deep otm tsla options I bought last summer. I’m up over $5M.
You can have all you want. Just gotta close ur eyes and suck it out of a hose.

Nope, just the rush here ha. I have problems.
Shock collars, invisible fences, cages etc etc
I think you make some great points and I agree that Tesla's 'secret sauce' to it's future is in the storage space. 

That said, I do not think Tesla's growing quality issues and other red flags are as immaterial as you present them. By Elon's own admission, everything Tesla does is a literally a bridge business to support scaling it's battery technology. If any of those bridges fail, then Tesla will never achieve the moat they're trying to build around their dominance in the storage space.

The false promises, the missed deadlines, the growing QC issues, the labor lawsuits, the inability to launch solar roof, the fact the energy business has a whole decreased deployments by OVER 10x since Elon bought it from himself(cousins) are starting to pile up and it's well documented. 

US vehicle sales are not growing at the rate Elon needs to remain a growth stock. Sales in Europe and China are being used to cover up for US sales that are signaling Elon cannot increase his market share in America. Also, sales in China are happening at much lower margins due to heavy discounting to secure large fleet orders used to hit aggressive quarterly targets.

There's reports that Tesla isn't paying vendors from now till the end of the year to secure profitability targets and avoid the embarrassment from the S&P500.  It's all..... very bad. Yes, there's a lot of shorting from the competition and I agree anyone who didn't expect them to fight back is lving under a rock. However, there's also extremely competent fund managers (including Michael Burry, who predicted the housing crash) who have been and remain convinced that Tesla is financially snake oil based on solid fundamental analysis that cuts through Elon's fake hype. There's a reason no competent CFO or CAO would take the job and Dave morton quit Tesla in under a month of trying to manage the chaos that is Tesla's balance sheet.


In short, I don't disagree with your vision of Tesla's future... but I wouldn't be so dismissive of how critical Elon's bullshit and mismanagement is to Tesla's survival.
Appreciate you calling it a good call. Although I'd also very much welcome an opposing view to see if I'm making any bad decisions or not

Some background:

MAXR is a company who specializes in delivering commercial overhead satellite imagery. They are considered to be an industry leader in this field. Multiple government agencies within the US Intelligence Community and the DOD have contracts with MAXR to deliver imagery. They had a change in leadership in 2019 after a rather nasty short report exposed some serious issues within the company, and the loss of their Worldview-4 satellite didn't help matters either. 

A few reasons to be bullish:

The CEO Daniel Jablonski - Since the new CEO took over in Jan 2019, the stock has gained more than 400%. The company was in massive debt, an issue which became his number one priority to fix. The leverage ratio is much improved since when he took over. Seeing as most of MAXR's clientele are government agencies, it's fitting that he has experience as a former naval officer. He knows his customer base, as does his board of directors.

The Board of Directors - Multiple members each with decades of experience within the US Government, DOD, IC etc. In particular, Gilman Louie was the founder of IN-Q-Tel, the first venture capital firm for the CIA. We recently added him to the BOD after the acquisition of Vricon, which will allow us to augment our imagery with 3D mapping capabilities.

The Upcoming Launch of Worldview Legion, a new satellite constellation - A better, more cost effective upgrade to the Worldview-3 satellite is going to allow for higher quality imagery to be captured much more often. Our current backlog is worth around $2.2 billion according to the most recent earnings report, and you can bet this number will significantly increase once Legion is in orbit - expected around Sep 2021. More details at [https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion](https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion) .

I advise you to do some digging and see for yourself! I seriously believe this is still a significantly undervalued company. Hope this helps! Now go get those tendies!
Beautiful! I stupidly sold my 350 shares that I bought at $295 last Feb. Good for you for holding these
Yes, you absolutely need the cash to buy it. He could buy it on margin. I am sure his broker would be fine with weekend risk in this case, and I am sure they would love to scrape off a few points of interest.

Are you serious? You bought an option that was 300% out of the money expiring in like 18 months. That is not an investor. This is obvious by the fact that you only put $500 or so into the trade. If you actually had any idea this was going to happen, you would have put $100k in and walked away with $200M. 

Saying you are not a trader while sharing this screenshot is like saying I invest in Mega Millions tickets.
Alright I'm awake, is it Monday yet?
230k cases yesterday, can’t wait for the market to go up Monday :)
"In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5."

It is extremely common for a news of a merger from an equities standpoint to have minimal or negative impact on one side and a strong positive on the other.

**“It’s the Apple of travel,”** says James Cordwell, an Atlantic Equities analyst. “Like Apple, Airbnb’s brand-building approach and design of its app have helped foster a sense of community and connection among users.”

Cordwell has already begun coverage, with an Overweight rating and a **price target of $75 a share**. He projects about $1 billion of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, for 2023, when he sees earnings of 40 cents a share. The IPO should benefit from what Cordwell calls a “scarcity of secular growth stories in online travel.”

No way
OH MY GOD
I’m conflicted, do I buy TSLA $690c or TSLA $420p for next year
lol imagine how the guy who sold the options feels
Make sure you have good money management and risk management. If you wanna trade of indicators then have like two or three so you can try to eliminate some false signals. If you want to trade news and macro then focus on things like what central banks are doing and saying, is a weak currency good or bad for that economy, what commodities are they dependant on, you can even use currency futures to help give you an idea of where things might be headed. Remeber that everything you could need to know is out there either for free or from a book. Stay away from ones that are clearly bs, like most of them on audible that have 6,000 5 star reviews and were written by someone with no pedigree in the financial world, do you're DD and you'll get there

For context, let's say he bought this at the absolute bottom tick on June 3, 2019. That would be a $177 price pre-split. He bought an option with a $680 strike expiring 18 months later. It was probably nearly the highest strike in the chain at the time. 

This was a series of lottery tickets and nothing more. I hope that OP takes the slot machine winnings and leaves options behind forever. There is absolutely no way this can be replicated. Hell, in March, these things were probably red and against all odds the meme power bailed the gamble out.

I’m honestly the kind of person, even with a good sized portfolio(100k+), like to do my own taxes, and I believe that would remain the same even if I am trading millions. I like to ingest all the info I can and then take recommendations, but at the end do the deed myself. 
I’ll be reading on a lot of laws and rules come April hahaha... thanks for all the help bud and good luck to you in your future endeavors
That’s the IPO, when it hits secondary markets/starts trading. 500K for a pre-ipo position sounds like guaranteed tendies

You need the money to buy the stocks at that price dumbass. Its a contract to buy the stocks at that price. If you choose not to exercise at that price because you cant afford it then you can just let it expire worthless. Thats why all you retards sell the "rights" to the contract before it expires to someone else before it expires because you cant afford to buy the actual stocks at the price.

good comment, just piggybacking for an important message...

>[u/jejakqmqm](https://www.reddit.com/user/jejakqmqm/) Ask about the potential dilution from warrants or PIPE shares set to go out.

Important info. Always read the SPAC filings. [Track important dates](https://stocktwits.com/DreamingOwl/message/248034848). Also, I suggest reading through posts on r/Hyliion if you want to see all the stages of euphoria and grief play out in full.

Yeah, I know what the reader may be thinking, all the way his choice is different. Look, this is not the first SPAC mania I've traded through in my lifetime. Have a plan. These SPACs present some incredible short-term opportunities. I'm actually using a rainy day to plan some large trades, and more than half are SPAC related.

Don't be the dumb liquidity that the big money is dumping into. Smart traders will trade into your fear and suffering if you are. Fuck the PIPE money in the ass before they fuck you.

Yes, the ETFs and mutual funds that track the S&P have to. This is going to continue push the price up within the next couple weeks. Sometime after that profits will be taken by many firms that do not track the S&P. I've been long shares since 2012 or 2013. The sell-off always comes.

This is the greatest without a doubt
In an ITM exercise transaction your broker will finance the cost of buying the shares and then immediately sell them to market to give you the difference,  they will usually take a small fee for doing so.  
  This is also one way in which you can lose money as well because the process doesn't complete until the next Market open and if the stock drops below your call price you can eat a huge dick come Monday morning.

Exactly, and EVs are gonna take over for ICE cars any second now, and when that happens, Nio will likely be one of the top manufacturers on the international market. Once they go international, that is. Where I live, almost half of all new cars sold are EVs, and the rest of the world is slowly starting to follow our lead.

Almost all the recent fluctuation seems to be from retail investors. Hoping this is a sign we’re nearing the bottom and that institutional investors will start buying up in bulk and while NIO is undervalued compared to recent analyst ratings.
Honestly some of the best calls I've seen are from random comments in the sub. Why I asked. 3 months from now I might look through those and think, damn that one dude is rich af lol
Well technically you should consider the application of wash rules between your accounts, but if they are with separate brokerages you could sell a loss in one and buy back that same stock in another brokerage without it getting reported as a wash to the IRS. It is a loophole in regards to the wash sales being reported. Just don't do it intentionally, but anyone can be forgetful at times. As far as sources I'll have to think about it I try to log any trade with a gain/loss over 1000 during the year to get a ballpark on my bottom line but I'm not sure of a specific source that would help without listing out your transactions for the year. To get a general idea of where you are you could add up your cost basis and cash of your portfolios as of your November 2020 statements and back off your basis and cash on your December 2019 statements, but this won't factor in wash sales.  For any securities you think you may have wash sales in that haven't been sold yet I would view their specific transaction history  with each brokerage. I wish their was a good source out their but Finance guys only care about their clients with million+ portfolios

Ya like for example it’s FIFO tax reporting so I first bought fastly at 97 so I’ll cut those first shares I bought if fastly is under 97 end of the month.  I also bought a bunch of ZYXI at 15 and kept buying the dip so I’ll cut the first ones I bought at 15.  I bought LAKE at 23.  I’ll cut those probably.  And I’ll put that $$ somewhere better and take the take loss up to 3k.

Weed stocks in a time frame of a year. With positive news on Friday of them getting the approval in the house, weed just needs senate approval. It'll moon after but probably not hugely.

AirBnB will likely be “pricey” due to interest in primary markets/MMs, do not be afraid to buy in. SNOW IPO released at a stupid valuation bc of this, though just look at what happened to SNOW after the first couple months of trading. Not to say you shouldn’t wait and find an attractive price point, just don’t ignore this opportunity.
O F U K it's happening!
Damn bro congrats
If they can survive the year until vaccines roll out they will survive, but I mean they were gouging the public even before corona so fuck em. The terrible fate of Helios and matheson should have been an indicator.
If he cant run a company and find funding with 0% interest rates then he should just hang himself and give his family the life insurance cause he has nothing to offer them.
Do you mean selling credit spreads instead of buying?
Once things are back to normal or close to with the vaccine rolling out, these food delivery stocks are doomed!!!! Over valued and if you get stuck holding your fault.
There’s always big money that will pay for these so they can exercise and flip them for a small but guaranteed quick profit. That’s why there will always be a buyer for ITM options.
Current portfolio down 8.33%, I consider this a win!
Are you fucking kidding me
They did do it in the actual election but they underestimated the turnout for the Republicans and after it looked like Trump was going to win in a landslide despite their best efforts they had to pull out all the stops and commit the most brazen electoral fraud since Stalin
$44-50 is initial range but probably like $60 final price based on other IPOs. Analyst already said $75+ price target though
I have G so far but want K too so I’d say both

The foreign exchange market isn’t an MLM. It’s literally the exchange of different currencies.

You’re basing it off one person? There’s substantial fraud moron. There’s proof that the dominion voting systems used an algorithm to count votes, there’s proof of people pulling suitcases from under tables to count after people left, there’s proof of double voters, there’s so much proof yet you decide not to look into. Explain how Trump was such a terrible president if he gained 10 million more votes in his second term. Explain how all the fraudulent activities over turned elections in states that Trump was winning only in democrat controlled counties that GOP observers were kicked out and mail in ballots were back dated by the USPS.
Holy fucking shit, you fucking retard, cash out before you lose hundreds of thousands!!!  


AND DO NOT EVER BUY A SINGLE OPTION EVER AGAIN! This is it dude, the one and only trade you need in your life.  


Put that money below your mattress and figure out how to invest it safely so it can work for you until the rest of your life.
How old are you? You married?? BTW, how long have you been trading. What’s your trading history in the beginning? When did you stop gambling weeklies?
Hey dad there you are I was looking all over for you let’s get out of this dildo store and go get some nuggies

Good luck. They're literally begging the retail momentum traders to buy their secondary offering. Its unprecedented, and sad. But it does speak to the massive distortions the Federal Reserve asset purchases and rate suppression create.
Thought you were doing just a straight up far otm naked call. Just wanted you to be aware that SNOW has been going up from what I think is a squeeze.

Yeah im on year 3 or so of daily use of my Solo, built like a tank and no sign of slowing down anytime soon
They do not expire worthless since they are ITM. They get exercised and turn into shares. If he does not have the capital to purchase the number of shares equivalent or the price he paid then the converted shares are sold after exercise and he takes the profit.

I still don't have a check. So... The same?
lol "free money" sure pal, I'm fairly certain your % tax payments will be much higher than mine on lesser earnings unless my options print :), that's how I see it.  Also being invested long in such an underpriced company like this would be the real "free money" since it has a very reasonable tax rate of only 15% using LT capital gains vs short term up to 39%.
Yeah but I can't cosplay dirty hairy when I'm tripping balls riding through the forest with that.

 I also considered a 10mm if I had the money I would definitely pick up an eaa witness hunter. At the end of the day the .357 just seemed like the right choice and I fucking love wheelguns.

I joined some group, and it made me lose interest in trading forex. In THAT moment at least, not like it can't be profitable. Although, I literally only made 2 trades, one made $50 and $110, then I stopped. This was like a month ago, I'll get back to it but on my own. I learned everything without the group or their videos, they were cringe as hell. 

Oh, and they were recommending overseas scam brokers to unsuspecting newbs. They'd be like, "OMG I just tried to withdraw 20k and my account got shut down!!!".😭 I always check things thoroughly, so I wasn't shocked.

Have to agree with Sorkin here. Went to a restaurant a few weeks back and things seemed fine until someone had a coughing fit at the next table. There's just too many variables outside of your control in a restaurant and you will be sitting there for at least an hour with your mask off for most of the time. In contrast, I can sneak in and out of Best Buy in under 10 minutes with minimal interaction with others. I feel for restaurants and small business, but  definitely safer in a big store where everyone is wearing masks.

I love forex so im being triggered by all you retards calling it an MLM. You have to be a complete idiot to pay for any kind of trading course, signals, anything like that
Once an option goes ITM like this if you ever offer to sell it to the point it makes money to auto execute and sell an algo will pick it up and do that. Liquidity is only an issue with OTM
You’re better off investing in forex bro
The kids upstairs were having a party last night and connected to my bluetooth soundbar hooked up to my TV and they piped in some raunchy porn on it. I woke up to the extremely loud sound of wet rhythmic slapping and them laughing. Fucking classic. I went up and had a beer with them after so I could tell them how good they got me. The kids are all right.
A spread in general is safer.

In a debit spread, your loss is limited to the net amount you paid and your gain is limited to the spread between the strike prices.

In a credit spread, your loss is limited to the spread between the strike prices and your gain is limited to the net amount you received.
Read my comment above. If u want to make some gain before Christmas. Then jump in the next two week from 7 to 19 before too late

I think the world will eventually look something like the movie Elysium or Altered Carbon (nflx show) where there is extreme social stratification exacerbated by technology & a small minority of ppl at the top will control the top technology. So i think the only reasonable thing to do is to try to acquire as much $$$ as possible and build up as much equity as possible in the top tech companies. Everything else will get left in the dust.

I don't have enough savings to put into this thing and retire if it goes parabolic, but a year worth of income will open up a lot of possibilities for me.  


Yeah, if that kind of squeeze happens, I will be tracking the price live. Revolut (the app I'm trading with), only allows 1 day worth of limit/stop orders, so I will cash out my principal when/if it hits $80 and try to time the highs if it goes nuclear above $100.

Everybody think it will be massive sell off on the same day TSLA add to SP500. And if everybody think so, then definitely will be a sell off. It will be between 21 to 24

If he hangs it out as a market order, it will absolutely be purchased by some large institution. It's deep in the money, delta is probably .99.
60 C, erm, no. Especially after a hard dip and that legislative shit? Yuh, you need to sell that shit on Monday, and buy a debit call spread, ITM or close to it. Maybe sell some put spreads to offset your losses. Don't think it's gonna dip more.
It's not depressing. If I fucked myself with forex I'd have to go get a real job (eww). She has the option to sell her dignity on the internet for real money... I'd say she landed on her feet.

That's some big money right there
The big guys take a day or two to resolve risks/liabilities/paper holdings if they had a big short before they will move the price up.  In essence they need to cover/close their short position for bookkeeping really.  I firmly believe we won't drop sub 6 ever again once their cleanup of shorts is done, this company was @ 8-9 2 years ago while this drug was in development.  They got raided back in 2019 by big shorts with (ethically grey area) financial media attack dogs on their side and this became the investment opportunity of a lifetime for many of us little guys (like me) if we had faith in the company to keep moving forward and not give up.  The long term big holders used the opportunity to add to their positions rather than selling off while some little guys got worked.  I hope we see a great revival of the price & valuation of this company since it's been nearly 2 years at this pitiful and unreal price tag & valuation especially since they have had nothing but success after success (if you look @ the data on their drugs/pipeline.)  I think the big $ should be past suppressing/building positions now and it's time to get back to a realistic valuation!

My valuation of the pipeline, approved products, and it's current finances right shows it should be around 12-14's (higher if we get decent news on some pipeline developments.)  And we're sitting @ 6, I'm not selling!

I'd give it a 1yr target of 25-35 on reasonable sales #'s, up in the 50-60's with good #'s and up in the 100-200's if the competition fails or the pipeline has good successes (reviewing the competitions work, 1 is maybe \~3 yrs away at best (for a rescue med), while the rest are 5-7 yrs (if they have great success) from market for prophylaxis and do not have statistical data published on HAE patients yet, just phase 1 on healthy people.)

HAE patient data from the competition will really show a better picture of where they stand but for some reason I suspect they will not have good data in HAE patients like they did in the P1 healthy individuals, and if bad enough may lead to dropping out competitively against BCRX.

 Hold this sucker til the week leading up to the merger, sell half your position.

But trailing stops depend on actual transactions. With a stock it works fine. With options the volume is so low and the spread is so wide the middle of the bid/ask can drop massively with no volume and you're fucked. 

Better if you can monitor it constantly to set a limit order at your absolute minimum acceptable profit, go to review order, monitor the bid/ask.  If it goes up you set a mental trailing stop loss, say $0.1 on the contract. When that hits your limit order is still below the bid so it executes.

I’m thinking it will almost mirror the other ipos we’ve seen this year: people pump and dump, bears short around 3 months after. I’m really hoping to time this one right. I thought about DASH or Air BnB, but AI could yield way more especially if it’s bought.

60% of the money supply is generational because the living population has only been around for, let’s say 20%, of the country’s history. Are you so dense that you think every new generation must start at 0? Also, only 20% of millionaires have inherited any of that generational wealth you speak about, confirming that the large majority of wealthy people started out far far poorer. They took advantage of the plentiful opportunities we all have (public stock market, for instance) and have risen.

Forex trading it self is perfectly fine. I love it, it's all about macro, it's a massive market with a daily volume of 5 trillion, you can trade 24/5. But what hes talking about is that there are thousands of pyramid schemes, signals tards, worthless courses, scams, and a pervasive idea that banks are trying to stop small traders out to create liquidity...in 5 trillion a day market.  Its sounds like he joined some sort of trading group, which is something only a lazy retard would do.

Almost.  Common shares for a lot of these SPACs have a floor value of $10 given back if they fail to merge, so there's limited downside the closer you bought to $10. Warrants can be worthless if there's no merger either, but they're a lot cheaper than common shares.

That side, it probably starts consolidating above 21 and below 25, forming a narrowing range before making its next move.

Can’t go too thick on the tomato. Adding something too juicy doesn’t mesh well with the cream cheese. A nice heirloom as you’ve suggested with a lower gel and higher flesh ratio makes for an ideal bagel sandwich, still not sliced too thick.

For almost all the stocks mentioned on this sub. "Non-equity" options are exempt but I rarely see them mentioned here. Look into section 1256 options and you should be able to figure out if specific ones you trade with apply.
To a reverse merger by buying acquiring a pinksheets listed company. The other day I was looking at the lowest market cap companies and there’s more than a few that I could actually buy. The thing is, probably only 20% of their shares are trading, but it was a fun thought exersize. I wonder though what would happen if somehow my all or none order got filled for one of those puppies.

Yeah, exactly what I want to know.. A lot of scam groups out there, but the forex market is real, and hard to trade also. Do you trade it?

You did say they were illegal. They’re not. And now, in the post Covid economy, more people than ever pay their rent by hosting on Airbnb and prefer to travel in an Airbnb where they don’t share common spaces with other people. Airbnb gained a lot of market share during Covid. There is no political will to fight Airbnb when they’re the way the locals are paying rent during a crisis.

In the pre Covid economy it was safer to stay at a hotel than a strangers house. In the post Covid economy it’s safer to stay in a private house with your own kitchen then a shared hotel with a lobby, breakfast buffets, and staff who may be contagious.

Airbnb doesn’t rely on gig workers. You’re thinking of Uber and Lyft and DoorDash. Airbnb relies on people renting out properties. The only gig workers are the cleaning people they sometimes hire. Having a maid is pretty common so it’s not an issue...
No, my view on China is current. I am talking about 2021, Biden taking over and overdo Chinese posture and geopolitical power.

Absolutely.

Then also start a SPAC called LULZ to merge with GME and use the WSB LLC investor meeting to vote for it. Set a strike for LULZ/W warrants of $11.11

Then you'll have double interest in GME, an even better short squeeze, and another moonshot along the way.

Tip: I don't actually know how SPACs work. Everything I just said is garbage

Ok, so I tried the bagel with cream cheese, tomato, and bacon as recommended earlier.  Can confirm the combination of the tomato with cream cheese is off putting, even after adding lettuce and avocado the tomato was still overpowering.  The catch here is that it was just a grocery store beefsteak, they don’t have much flavor; so if I was gonna try it again it would be with a dark heirloom tomato.

For fucks sake don't hold for more than another week. I'm bullish on Tesla but it's already overbought. Goldman Sachs just came out with a huge price target increase when it is already overbought. They get to be correct in the long term, while boosting sentiment and further increasing the stock price thereby creating themselves a huge short opportunity. Just because it's illegal doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Chinese Wall my ass.

I would take profits and use the buying power on selling front put ratio spreads to pick up some highly discounted shares. Or just sell some and execute the rest. Just don't hold much longer.
This is the only reason I feel confident in not fucking myself over. I always stick to my position and bets so long as the research I did was solid even when I feel like a moron for being down big in the short term. Almost always it turns around.

Down from 100% when they only made one model. What a stupid ratio you invented there. "93% of Teslas have never had a single recall" I guess doesn't sound as good?

Here's the funny thing -- Waymo is a joke, but Intel's subsidiary actually has some good self-driving technology. But you're still selling Waymo -- the Arizona tea and golf cart company. Why? Tesla is far, far ahead of it.

Totally off topic here and unrelated to this ticker, but related to Rads and medical specialties in general.

As you probably know, CMS just cut reimbursement for many specialties, including Rads, in order to increase reimbursement for E/M visits. Do you think there's any way to reverse this? What's the likelihood? Further cuts going forward in the future? How do you think this'll affect quality of care?

I suspect this'll not only be a pay cut but also slow down the adoption of expensive tech used in all the specialties. Ultimately, specialists will take a pay cut but medical equipment won't be updated as frequently for many specialty services. I foresee this trend of funding cuts into the future.

What are your thoughts?

I do monthly calls and I don't do 1k each. I never said that. I take 5 calls usually. I almost always hit 1 of the 5 basically covering all loses. Hitting 3 of the 5 means a good profit. I rinse and repeat until I have a little change and take some out for savings. Then rinse and repeat. If you are making educated guesses and not just yoloing on meme stocks its a solid strategy. Sorry you are a gay bear and can't make it work. I'm not putting in 1k weekly and losing it. The portfolio goes up and down off my original 1k. And I'm playing off that.

I’ve never exercised an option for a stock outside my price range that I only wanted to flip, and $60K per option is definitely outside my range once, must leas 20 times.

Definitely, and its always more enjoyable asking you retards than actually waste time reading on google!
Because this is how the majority of people trade. They don’t have an exit amount ahead of time that they are happy with so greed takes over and they convince themselves they’ve found the best stock in the world and it’s going to continue to rise because it’s the next Tesla. Institutions rely on these shmucks because they’ll hold until gone to $0.

The regulatory stuff is largely dealt with outside of a few major European cities. Even New York finally decided to play nice. And now with the pandemic, more people than ever rely on Airbnb rentals to pay their mortgage so the political will to crack down is gone.

In 2017 and 2018 they spent about 3.5% on sales and marketing. In 2019 they ramped up Google Ads to drive growth (copying Booking.coms marketing style) and sponsored the next nine years of Olympics which required billions. This took sales and marketing spend to 33% and it has now gone way back down in 2020 as they stopped Google Advertising while *gaining* market share. It turns out when people Google “Airbnb” they don’t need an ad to find the right site which saves $500 million per year.

Cheeky already said copying Booking.com marketing spend was an experiment and didn’t work out. Their brand is *much* stronger than Booking and they keep most of the growth without the marketing spend and they get to show profit and better financials as well

Would make sense to give out some extra bonuses to their staff after doubling their expected sales figures, but I'd have no idea. I'm just casually browsing r/all and clicked this because I've followed Nio for a few weeks wondering if I should yolo my way into investing. Never bought a stock in my life, I just have a gut feeling that Nio is gonna soar in a few years.
I’m saying taxes are to low. We had economic prosperity in America, then we had the gas crisis and somehow the rich convinced everyone if you give less money to the government then the country will be better.

Those protections are actually shackles. There’s a poverty cliff, once you make above what gov programs allow they take it away. Their is a margin where you make less by making more, and if your situation changes for the worst it can take literal years to get to back onto our social welfare systems. Years where you are absolutely fucked. 

The middle class gets fucked simply because we don’t tax the rich enough to fund the government. 75% of all taxes are paid by people who make between 50,000 and 2,000,000, 50% of all taxes are paid by people who make between 50,000 and 500,000. 



40 years later we have a government shut down almost every year and the young have it harder than ever to find upward mobility. On top of all the other social issues.

Butterfly’s acquisition by Longview and the massive support it’s seeing by Billy Gates and other large investors seems more like a humanitarian effort rather than a sound economic decision.

I’m not sure if they think they can strong arm Warner into compensating them despite AMC not playing any part in this, so it’ll be interesting to see what the fallout is. AMC could try to threaten to never have a Warner movie shown in their theaters again, but that would just leave the door open to Cinemark. And if they both agreed to never show Warner movies, that could open the door to charges of duopoly and abuse of their market power. Which would be ironic given the state of their actual market.

If a trader does 100 trades a day and the vast majority is profitable, is that over trading? What about a trader who usually does 1 trade a day profitably but then starts doing 2 trades and day and loses money? Over trading or just making bad trades?

So in short: Intel has promises, vague promises of future technology (they've promised future technology before and had to sell off the entire group, as one example), lots of "assets" but cash burn and delayed supercomputers.

Not sure if that's as compelling as you think.
I use Salesforce and I don't use Slack. But, if Salesforce figures out how to push out Slack as part of the existing relationships it could increase adoption by a lot. Not just IT teams but all teams.

I see the appeal. But it's a long term play. I doubt it will be accretive any time soon. i don't see existing customers saying "hey let me pay you a bunch more for Slack". It's more like Salesforce adds that on almost for free and it increases vendor lock in. Good long term strategy, very expensive short term.

I think the market got it right because the money they just plunked down will take a very long time to get payback on...particularly since slack isn't even profitable yet.

I doubled down on my calls Thursday.  Half Jan 30s and half Dec 2021 20s.. both had literally less than 0.05 premium at the time
First thought I had too - how on earth are you going to move these beasts?
You optimism is truly inspiring.
Facts like i have been better at being more emotionless but i still feel the urge to like risk it for the huge gains but thats how you can lose it all. But thank you for the advice i like weekend autists the most
I dunno but calls on lovesac. Good ring to it
They're in the process of rebranding, there's a new logo.

It sounds like Alopecia,. It can be environmental or from stress.   Mine started after being stuck in a boarder town between Honduras and Nicaragua for a few days thinking I would never get out.  Small patch on my beard.   15 years later I have no facial hair left, and patches all over my head. So I just shave it all every day looking like Dr. Evil   It can effect your eyebrows and eye lashes also.   Dermatologist can treat it with steroid injections or you can YOLO on Regeneron Monday morning.   Neither feel good, both will take your money.
why can't he just sell it at market price?

On the initial news that vaccines were effective both tech and rona hype stocks deflated and volume was drawn out as people moved into smaller cap and recovery stocks...that was just a few weeks ago my goldfish friend.

Long term amazon will be good but, vaccine news is not good thing for these short term calls is the idea.
GME. But not in 5 years. More like 5 weeks.

Yes this year honestly has been a blessing and a curse in different aspects of my life. Being new to adult life its like i get a chance to breathe and focus on school and myself.

Lost $700 on PLTR options in my first play. Looking back(when I was up $400) I should have pulled out. But only my couch does that. Glad my dumb ass learned with $700 and not $7k

Okay I’ll be nice a fill you all in - next stimmy has already been priced in for the past week or so. That’s why we are hitting all time highs right now.  The rug will be pulled after the lackluster stimulus comes out.  That’s the game plan.

You have a good point. So many reasons this could fall. I think it takes a hard dump in Jan. (Possibly even next week) If retard strength didnt break the short it's not going to squeeze like everyone is expecting. Earnings on this means shit in the long run holidays will be over and the next gen wont be new anymore. Revenues dropping faster than a hookers panties for YEARS. It took 2 of the biggest releases in almost a decade just for them to utter the word profitability. I'll take the downvotes with you buddy

🌈🐻s? Did you tell them stocks only go up?
True, unless I sold my 2nd trade after the first losing trade, before the end of the year, for a loss or gain. That wouldn’t be counted as a wash sale, right? Since I sold both before tax year. 

Unless I lose money on the 2nd trade, and open a third one that I do not close before the end of the year, then the 2nd trade loss would be a wash and not counted, but the first one will be. So on and so forth. Let me know if I am mistaken
I’ll listen to this at market open as I watch my options open at -50%
Also canadian, positions?

Yeah how the fuck are you betting against the market next week???

Grabbed some 30k worth of stock last week. I get that analysts are skeptical about the price of Slack, but Salesforce has an autistic level of success with previous acquisitions - every single acquisition multiplied revenue since acquisition.

As far as Slack goes - companies were dropping them in favor of MS Teams right and left, I doubt they would keep growing at the pace they did without CRM acquiring them. This gives both sides a better fighting chance against Microsoft.

Uh why are you applying to min wage jobs with those degrees?  Better to send out eight well crafted applications for high paying jobs than 60 min wage ones.  

They don't want you flipping burgers if they think you're going to leave.  Gotta sell out and be some analyst/researcher for a faceless tech corporation, or IT guy for a smaller company.  

If there is anything you can learn here is that the white collar tech economy is doing great, the service industry and min wage work is what is struggling.

You don't even stay on topic you keep throwing out anecdotes from wherever the hell you live, I assume Flint. Government is not the solution, communities are. Enough of this Dem v. Rep shit the world is not a dichotomy where one is good and one is bad and we were not discussing anything except the fact solicitation laws are unconstitutional. Government won't fix these issues people and organizations can though. 

Your proposals that sparked this were horrendous and fucked in the head. I'm not convinced you are even paying attention to what we are talking about rather you are trying to attack Democrats who I hate probably more than you do.

Sure. Only problem I see, somewhat similar to Lyft, that so many people look forward to the IPO that hype could propel it to 100% over IPO price or some other ridicoulus figure. Which is good for early investors and bad for retails that holds the bag atleast in the short term. Long term Airbnb might be fine. Personally I don't really like all the regulatory problems they are getting themselves into, many countries in Europe are lobbying hard against Airbnb. Numbers also don't really suggest hyper growth anymore, but its difficult to discern whats the effect of the pandemic and whats not. Also cutting all marketing isn't bullish, thats gonna slow growth for sure.

Newton’s 4th rule
If you can’t be profitable with 3 day trades, you won’t with unlimited.
Averaging in and bouncing out with an Irish goodbye does, though.
**What the hell are you talking about with that second part? You're not paying capital gains on a profit WHILE losing it all, that's adding losses to losses, and the IRS isn't that evil. Don't give OP a heart attack.** 

The downside risk of a wash sale is that the losses from a losing trade are added instead to your current cost-basis for your new trade, which offsets your ability to use them as tax writeoffs.

**"Assume you buy 100 shares of Legree Recreation for $10,000, which you later sell for $7,500. Within 30 days of the sale, you acquire another 100 shares for $8,000. In effect, your $2,500 loss is postponed, rather than disallowed permanently. This is because the basis of the new stock for purposes of figuring gain or loss becomes $10,500 – the sum of the $8,000 cost and the $2,500 disallowed loss."**

Also, irrelevant, but for anyone who was considering the opposite scenario, don't worry:

**"An often-misunderstood point: The wash sale restrictions don’t apply to profits on sales of shares of stock. You’re free to take your profits and immediately reinvest.
The wash sale rules come into play only when you suffer a loss on the sale of shares of stock (including shares of mutual funds or exchanged-traded funds) or securities and purchase, or buy an option to purchase, “substantially identical” stock or securities."**

Patience is a virtue. Whenever I'm about to out $ down on options I tell myself that this money was never mine in the first place, and that I took it from someone else by taking these types of risks. If it goes sideways, the Gods will it.
It's obviously 20 dollar.  Nice months profit.
The 30 days applies to the 2nd acquisition you do not have to sell it in order for it to be considered a wash.

 I.e. if you sold PLTR for a loss then bought it back within 30 days it will be considered a wash sale whether you sell the second position or not during the year.

Buying calls on this review
It’s insane. I’ve been trying to encourage my friends to invest during this pandemic, and they don’t even try to listen. They simply just brush it off or straight up ignore what I have to say about it. I’m not even trying to get them to do options, but to just hold on to ETFs or safer stocks. Craziest part is that they’re always talking about how they never have money, and this has been one of the easiest time to profit from the market.

How much farther do you think it will sink? I’m not fully convinced it has much more room to run down, although I agree that it will live in the low 90’s for at least the next few months.

The short interest and possibly of a short squeeze is appealing as well. 

But I will not  buy it until the squeeze starts happening. If it gets over 20 I will start buying and use buy at market orders to help the squeeze. 

After earnings if it gets over 20 I'm in. But I dont think the numbers are going to be good with pandemic etc.... 

It's a wait and see game...
Coming from inside another big box retailer, our Black Friday day sales were below average, but that's because we weren't having anything exclusive to that day. Our sales started a few weeks ago and ran through this week, some to the end of the month. But overall out QTD sales are through the roof.
A retard buys a stonk at $30 and sells at $40, he again buys it at $50 and sells at $60, what is his overall gain or loss? a) $10 loss b) $10 profit c) $20 profit d) breakeven

You can get that back easily
Too *
I pretty much just asked her how much she typically made in a month and then gave it to her. It wasn’t too much and definitely didn’t change my situation so I pretty much just told her to not worry about getting me back until she found something. Had it back to me within the first five weeks of her new job. The people who are telling you “never loan money to loved ones” aren’t accounting for the fact that this scenario is completely different. As long as the trust is there you’ll be set. She’ll be able to take a massive sigh of relief knowing she doesn’t have to panic about whether or not she can eat for the week

The math is proven
Intel 52 calls did me goodly
Considering that, like some of the other people mentioned above, I wouldn’t just hand her cash. Let her stay at your place, like you’ve been doing, until she can get back on her feet. Support her by encouraging her and also potentially helping her to become a better saver or to become better with her own cash.
Last time I got on there I got harassed by gay dudes that live nearby
Tbh I’m rather new to this and I don’t like talking out of my ass. But the fact that the company is quite hyped, it would make sense to ride the train for a bit. That’s a good point. I guess we’ll have to see. It’s IPO date is the 10th so I’ll be watching closely.
I guess it all depends on a) did their growth slow just because of the pandemic or were there other reasons and b) can they compete with cloud providers who might offer similar services

You're viewing this through a looking glass, dismissing all other points of view.

Please, instead of dismissing what I find to be a fact, go and find the facts out for yourself. It's not hard to research party affiliations at the city and county level.

At least in my immediate community, attempting to get an upgrade to LED street lights like the rest of the county, greenscape medians or even unlevel manholes fixed were all met with a lot of excuses and/or timelines that are many years out. I couldn't begin to count the amount of hours contacting these bastards. Even with 1b in free money to play with due to a temporary sales tax increase, they refuse to even plan a project to improve upon hood living conditions. Considering the rest of the county is already upgraded, they decided a good way to blow through a couple hundred mil is to build a huge facility for this temporary tax board to meet every so often.

I'll never forget Warren Buffett suggesting he's some kind of mutant when it comes to how his emotions play into stock choices.

For most of us our emotions are almost always the enemy. We almost always feel losses more keenly than gains. This is an evolutionary trait that comes from loss meaning you get eaten by a lion so we are inherently risk averse. A big red satan dildo triggers that primal fear that something is about to kill us.

That's why most people are better off just putting their money in an index fund and never looking at it. If you don't look at it then you won't have your emotions triggered and you won't make moves that ultimately fuck you over.

I know for me the hardest thing to overcome is when I'm down for a long time and I feel bad about it then the whole thing goes even, then a little green I sell to get rid of that piece of shit that hurt my feelings for so long. Then of course it goes on to get greener every day because thats how fucking risk works. The bigger the down the bigger the up, over time, if you're not exclusively in FDs.

Why do I still do it? I decided a while ago it's a very expensive hobby. I don't even expect to make money over time. I don't expect to lose a lot of money but I do know I'd be way better off if I stopped all my speculations and just put it all in SPY or whatever.

Cibc investors edge is solid. Lowest commission out of the big 5 banks at 6$ per equity trade. I’ve found most of the other platforms in Canada that offer free trading (ie wealth simple) more than get their commissions back on various account charges and currency conversion fees. Basically, Canada doesn’t have a great robinhood equivalent
That makes sense.   I'm just skipping Tesla and buying PLTR.
Lyft is a shifty business tbh even though I prefer them to Uber. They aren’t internationally at all basically so they lose the network effects that are the whole reason Airbnb is worth so much. That’s the difference

I travel abroad and have to use Uber, Bla Bla Car, ZimRide, PopaRide, Motar, sRide, Grab, Cabify, MyTaxi, etc. It is a totally regional industry outside of a couple like Uber that are trying to take bigger losses to own the network effects. But they largely lost as they exited China and India and other major markets.

Uber is solidly at all time highs. You just bought the regional player that couldn’t compete. Airbnb too will dominate but they have far fewer issues than Uber anyway. Travis was a trainwreck for one and they’ve had to abandon the self driving unit they bought for billions...

There’s a DD post on it. TLDR it just acquired another company and their earnings were way over what was expected but the stock dipped because people weren’t happy with the company they bought.
Yea I know what it stands for but from what I’ve read about MLM, and my experience is basically exclusively Herbalife. It’s all about recruiting people below you to sell products wholesale to them. Not selling products to individual customers. I guess Herbalife was both MLM and ponzi.

I feel this so deep.  I bought into 2 shitty cannabis penny stocks 4 years ago. Averaged down on both at least a half dozen times as they collapsed to nothing.  Held until maybe 2 months ago.

Now at .20 and .35/share and house voted to decriminalize so no signs of slowing...

too true.... I said the same thing when I first started back in February/March... I knew the market was going to crash from the virus... played some UVXY calls and made bank... but my inexperience really came to light once I realized what PDT was and that I couldn't even sell those options that were up 2-3000x % going into the weekend... Monday rolls around, they all dropped to the negative... Beginners luck, maybe... I think it was one smart play I made in a game I played very, very poorly lol.. took me until this week to finally get back to even from that fiasco... needless to say, I've learned quite a bit... took me until this week to finally get back to even for the year... just glad I actually learned from my mistakes and turned that shit around.

Disagree. You should play the market and learn the hard way and not be such a pussy. You’ll make stupid decisions that turn out to work in your favor if you paper trade because you know instinctively that you aren’t losing anything.

You too brother
She literally can’t work cuz her industry is shutdown due to Covid. I’m not worried she will leave me, it’s genuine need not a sugar daddy scenario. Even if it was tho, she’s 6 years younger than me and smoking hot so kinda worth it 😂
I was following a girl who went from forex to onlyfans.  It's funny to think about but it was depressing as hell.  She was doing all the MLM aspects of recruiting people to it as well.
Not sure so am thinking of waiting it out

Going by pure TA the resistance is at $88 not $100. Actually $100 is a pretty soft support and there is a good chance it won't hold. These could print but certainly a big gamble
LOL idk anymore i just dont. You have a good weekend too sorry i just got tilted. 💀
pretty sure there should be also be a link for web conference, I don't remember calling (who calls nowadays) for the last earnings call
Where do you see it going?
The guy had a disadvantage in literally every way. Weight, height, reach..for why my guy, for why 😂
Of course it does. It just also has a much lower potential pay out.

CNBC should hire you for market analysis
Bet yea just started investing and trading made some gain but want to triple my money but definitely know better then to jump on a hype train at the last stop having trouble figuring out what’s being pumped for mooning so I can get in early
nope. it is as such because you still have an open position. 

the straight forward explanation is that taxes aren't determined until you have a closing order. IOW, when you are creating covered calls, you are "selling to open", and until you do a "buy to close" your position is still open.

Looking at it from the other view, it is like asking the question "when you buy option contracts, you spend $x for it, why can't you write off the tax on premium you paid immediately".

Here is a simple example you may understand. If you write a call, without owning shares of the underlying, and get $100 in premium for it. Stock shoots like crazy, and you have to buy it back for $1k. You've made a loss regardless of the premium you collected.

You gotta ask yourself how much you care about her and the long term prospects. Also, is she crazy? Bad with money? Looking for the sugar daddy? or just fallen on hard times?

I made the mistake of buying everything under the sun for my ex and she took me for all I was worth and left me with a broken heart and zero tendies...
I just realized that the radio ads I've been hearing for some random tech company that I couldn't remember the name of on NPR stations across the united states for the last decade were ads for [c3.ai](https://c3.ai).

Yeah she’s been living with me past month since her lease was up. I’ve been buying all the dinners and groc etc. I’m just gonna keep providing food and shelter for her until everything clears up. I agree giving her money can make things tricky. Thanks for the reply.
But if advice - only day trade them at first. Theta decay will kick your ass and take your money.
Yeah I agree with you. I don’t know much about the company so would need to look into it more. My general worry is that it’s priced very expensive and it’s a covid stock, which is why it has 5x this year, and the question now is if the party is over
Fuck palantir
AMD 120 by mid next year at latest IMO. Yes. Momentum chasing. That's why I only trade using Heikin-Ashi on 15, 30, 1d timeframes friend. Wrote this on AMD back in early October, shortly after first event. Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug friend!

It’s cool but the survey should really also say “how soft are your hands and how quickly will you jump ship?” Its nice when an actually good play gains some traction, but a lot these meme boys have ADHD and soft peen hands and will bail at the first sign of temporary losses or dwindling attention spans...

Good luck with that. The problem is that the farther you get from reality the more reality hits you guys in the face -- see Covid.

Cramer pumped it
I do spread because I have never been able to time the bottom on TSLA options that well. My spread this week gained money when TSLA went down even though I bought Monday at 595
He didn’t have a single 🚀in his post.  And he wants us to believe he did research🧐
Feel asleep through close yesterday. Sure do hope tesla moons monday and I dont lose all my gains.
Haha I do tho! I just have never been in this situation before and have no idea how it works.
Holy fuck I'm dying 💀💀💀

Some dude on the robinhood facebook page asked if he sold his options, is he gonna only get back only the +$100 or his whole $300 back 🤣🤣🤣

These noobs are gonna get wiped out in a couple months
Guess who sold their H-COCK calls 🤡🤡🤡🤡 atleast I have shares
No point in eating good if you're broke tbh, rather at least try to get gains
Actually it’s not even an MLM. It’s just a pyramid scheme. They aren’t actually selling anything. You are literally just paying for the right to collect money from the people below you. Tron is just the method of payment.

Why do people still think there is *another* market crash coming?  Something that happens once every ten years and yet retards keep placing bets as if it should be occurring every month.

Meanwhile, even the simplest of bets on SPXL would have you up 200% this year.  FFS you could have taken that money and lived a nice life on deep OTM covered calls.  Even my embarrassing portfolio brings in $500-$1000 each month.

Three words: trailing stop loss.
What platform is this?
Pltr was trading around 9-10$ for a MONth. If you just got into investing (like me) it’s just unlucky that we weren’t in the game a month ago. Just keep an eye out on upcoming ipos and do your research. If Palantir really does lock down this monopoly and starts making serious revenue it’s going to be massive in a few years due to no competition and ridiculous barrier to entry, despite it being a meme stock.
Lmao you are right, but I do have most of the the authority for hiring people. We are out of the midwest US. But there are campuses all over.

Your expert is not an expert at all.

If you use LIDAR for occlusion penetration, ie. for snow, then you risk blinding people and damaging cameras at the wrong frequency. If you turn down the beam then you don't get good occlusion penetration. Ie. you get optical sensors which is what Tesla has (along with radar).

Maybe your expert should go back to school.
I do FD’s like that every now and then. Tell me why I made 500% on PLTR the week before it even hit $30 doing that 😂

Best Buy is shutting all 50 stores in Mexico before end of year. Yes it may be separate entity whatever but I still smell red for Best Buy US
It sure is boilerplate. But it also an admission that they weren't proftable yet. Somewhere down someone claimed they were profitable by extraploating from Q3 numbers.
Yeah its sad, some people just get an idea and you cant change it

you are correct in that he has not served a full term but it's not bc you have shorter terms there (all senate terms are for 6 years) it's bc he was granted the office after Johnny Isakson resigned on December 31, 2019. that headline, as many are is a bit misleading if one wasn't already aware of that.
Are you trying to turn this into a Dem vs Repub discussion? Do your own "research" like Google I'm sure is what you mean. You used SNL skit as a means to compel me - you need to read a book and get a real education about the human condition not just Google things that confirm your biases and watching sketch comedies and memes.

Dollar is definitely going to bounce and it's definitely going to mean red days but it'll be just that... A bounce before tanking harder
I want to agree with you but we dont know that $105 will act as support. Sure it gets a couple touches but this could easily pull back towards the $92-$98 levels before ripping.
Can’t really call them baby boomers until they’ve boomed babies
Alright why the fuck did I sell my (H)CAC position on wednesday. Is there any news for what happened AH yesterday?
The question should really be, will you(r friend) be able to better invest the currently tied up capital to make better gains in less amount of time for PLTR to hit break even?
I love Papa Musk, really do and TSLA has been kind to me but you need a full 5yr PhD in Epic Bullshit to justify even 10% of their current valuation
I had a client who retired with a 1.6m pension lump that he let me pick out mutual funds with, and he would manage his 500k after tax account. This was around 2015/16. 

He bought stocks of companies he "knew were good" like SWN.

A couple years go by and his after tax account is down to like 150k from 500k. Filled with tickers down 50%-80%.

He would still look me in the eye and say that he made money...like how bro, howwww

What’s better a spread on a stock like TSLA or just buy the option straight out? 

A stock like TSLA can swing $20-40 I. A single day making a single leg option very valuable while gains on a spread crawl in comparison. But with spread can buy several for the same cost basis. But which would gain more value? (Short term)

I’m not patient enough to hold til expiration mainly because it can turn negative $20-40 just as quick as it went up..
Based on fibs, I see 400 but I think at least a slight pull back is due. Likely not enough for OP to win his bet though.
I haven’t done that much research on it but I believe their valuation took a bit of a hit with less spending due to covid. If it dips a little after the IPO I’d be interested.
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man. 🚀🚀🚀

I woke up from a dead sleep at 10:30 on Monday morning and unconsciously bought options with absolutely no forethought, fell back asleep and awoke to find that I've bought an uncomfortable number of $25 dollar SIX puts that expire on the fucking 18th. No buyers. Little volume.

I've done this a few times and I've experienced a surprising amount of luck, but I don't see that happening here. What would need to happen for SIX to crash 30% in the next two weeks?

I don't know enough about markets to speculate about how over-valued the bubble is. But part of the rush is climate change; even the most pessimistic estimates for temperature increases are proving to be too generous. We'll likely be at a 1.5 increase by 2024. This isn't counting 4 years of mango pumping methane with no consequences.

The automotive sector is one of the most emission-intensive sectors in every economy. So part of the momentum behind EV's is governments realizing we're all fucked unless we grab the wheel and yank it toward emission mitigation and soon. Wouldn't be surprised to see this type of growth in grid-based energies in the next few years as that is generally the next big emitting sector. 

So idk if the EV bubble will pop or not but it is a different situation than the .com bubble, for example, because success of the over-valued industry isn't a necessary condition for human habitability on the planet.
Agreed it is a shit business, but isn't the 'might never be profitable' warning pretty much boilerplate language at this point? 

A different discussion whether companies that have never made money and probably never will should even be going public, but this is 2020 and stonks only go up.

Its the same with Airbnb. They actually warn in their IPO prospectus they could never be profitable.

In May they laid off 25% of its workforce and cut marketing spend for the rest of the year. (Otherwise even Q3 would have been a loss). It was also given an emergency $2bn cash injection from private equity.

Yearly losses are actually accelarating, started even before the pandemic, revenue is going down as well. IPO is as over hyped as Lyft was. Its gonna be a turd.

"We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business and tightening our cash conversion cycle. We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last 1.5 years. We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year. While this goal remains a genuine challenge, **we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.**"

You said Airbnb was unprofitable but C3 is IPOing this week. Then you called out a boilerplate line from the Airbnb prospectus about never being profitable that’s in every single IPO document indicating you don’t read them

I agree selling CCs is wiser than selling shares. However, if you're selling CCs when the squeeze could happen at any time, aren't you essentially trying to time the market that the squeeze won't happen during your CC selling? You'll miss out on gains if the squeeze happens and you have to sell your shares for way cheaper

Who’s hopping on the DASH and ABNB IPOs on the 9th and 10th?
Its a false choice; locking in small gains and diamond hands. You dont have to do either— use a trailing stop that is wide enough to not trigger on small retracements, but will allow a winner to keep running. You will never catch the top tick, but will not take profits too early and leave money on the table. You will give back some profits letting it run and waiting for the big pullback, but its better than locking in small gains that went on to become big winners.

Well yeah turns out they didn’t need the marketing spend as they gained market share. Bullish

Operating with less staff after cutting non core initiatives. Bullish

They were profitable 2017 and 2018 EBITDA before they pumped tons of money into the Olympics in 2019 which will pay off next year.

You seem like you’re new to tech IPOs since you’re citing boilerplate language that’s in every prospectus as if it’s something to be concerned about. Airbnb is a hyper growth company which uses capital to create network effects that prevent smaller competitors from being able to keep up. They *intentionally* weren’t profitable as they were investing to get their brand and host network established.

Now they IPO into the fourth quarter which has more bookings than the third quarter every year but they chose to invest it to drive revenue growth / market share over the holidays each year as opposed to focusing on margins and income like a small business with no VC capital.

I’ve been following their financials waiting for an IPO for a decade and I actually read the S-1 so I’m actually quite well aware of their financials by now.

Meanwhile you have no response for that fact that C3 is unprofitable even though you implied they were. Doesn’t convince me you read the S-1.

Holy fuck, no lie man
I see.. well done
Consolidation in the $107-105 area? Buying support? Da fuq u talking about? Its dropped every day for like 8 days in a row with almost no slowing down. Look at the candle on the daily for Friday... Where are you seeing buying support? Its literally a solid red candle... no wick to speak of. There was 0 buying pressure on Friday.   


Could this be the bottom? Possibly, YOLO. The bottom has to be somewhere.... it aint dropping to 0.  


Is there any real indication that this is the bottom from a technical analysis stand point? No. Friday was a solid selling off day with 0 indication that the bleed is going to stop.   


There is stronger indication that this will gap fade into the $80s rather than jump to $120.  


Id at least wait for some sort of confirmation of a turn around before I YOLO my money. But, then again, retards gunna retard.

I suggest you do the same and read my initial argument as well.  My actual initial statement was and always has been related to Rick Santelli which is what the actual post was about.  

If it helps you feel good to jerk off to minor misstatements that were later backtracked but STILL BELIES the entire original point then hey man go right ahead and enjoy

My statement has been clarified multiple times now that I was speaking in the utility of users of this sub and average American investors.  I’m don’t feel the need to continue this discussion further as I have clarified this position multiple times and you would like to beat your chest over and over about a misused turn of phrase.  

So enjoy dude. The entire fucking original post and OP is about Rick Santelli.  This isn’t a post about the utility of bonds in forming a fully diversified portfolio.  Ultimately you realize that you had no real point to make just wanted to dunk on an out of context statement that has been further clarified like 10 times now. 

Also an English lesson for your

PHYSICALLY- adverb- 

-in a way that relates to the real world and things perceived through the senses as opposed to the mind.

-in terms of what is possible in the real world.

Sooooo  physically was the appropriate adverb used to describe the way that the bond market trading revenues relate to the equity trading revenues of GS.   

But lawyer rule 101: when you no longer feel the conviction of your arguments instead attack the language of your opponents arguments instead.  
——— so yea the second you start with that I’m pretty sure you don’t have any much more to contribute but thanks for the discussion.

Says the virgin.
Ark has been accumulating for a long time. They haven’t sold a single share. With that occurring it’s going to take off, no matter what the company does. They’ve had news, etc, but it doesn’t matter. If you see a stock with long periods of accumulation like that then jump in. 

They will be releasing their first generation of salmon into stores soon so that could be the reason why all of the sudden it shot up. 

This company isn’t going anywhere. If you’re interested in a longterm hold I think it could be a fun one to get into. Short term 🤷🏼‍♂️. All I know is ark isn’t selling.

I’ve had a google alert on aquabounty for a few months and they used to get me a story every week. Recently it has been multiple stories a day.
well its just in the works man, by next march or april we are all gonna be good. its just like PS5’s. You cant find any right now but in a few months itll be available. Although stocks being at the highs they are now is concerning, imo idk how things could get any worse. Terrible leadership, no stimulus, no economic relief, virus concerns. I mean all of these things are going to change for the better, guaranteed. Unemployment will drop and more regular people will invest in the markets. However, the 1% may hurt the market under Biden if they arent getting as many freebies
I know how percentages work ya loon

Just from your username shows that you flex and have no money. You’re poor 🥲

I grinded my way up to 240k over three years and lost 125k in September some how.  Never give up OP.  I prayed to God that if he helped me recover my account then I would never doubt him again. In November I went from 115k to 180k.

>What is stopping gamestop from producing vaccine materials, and transistors.

Sanity from their leadership, that's what. haha

But if they do start selling more PC accessories, eventually a limited selection of hardware, and promote in house (console and PC) gaming and events then they will likely not only survive but thrive in the market.

I like their chances.  Most smaller cities and towns don't have a brick and mortar store that carries PC hardware or hosts events.  But they do have a gamestop.  Which makes them the only.. game.. in town for this niche.  

And while a lot of people don't mind logging into the Amazon site/app and making a few clicks then waiting a day or two for parts, there are a lot of people also who would rather run into a physical store, get the item, and get out 30 min roundtrip.  Or don't know what they or their kids want and go to a physical store to ask sales for advice.  Theres no advice giver on amazon direct.

Especially around holidays.  Go stand in a gamestop and watch the customers that come in the door.  A lot of non geek people who either have kids who game or they game themselves but aren't into the culture. 

By transitioning to the things I mentioned above, gamestop retains BOTH groups.

I don't buy in too heavily to the infinite squeeze meme.  But I think the company has a decent opportunity to really turn it around for the long term, if they play it correctly.  They also have an opportunity to really screw it up too, if they try to hold onto legacy gaming too strongly.  I'm cautiously optimistic they have the right leadership though to transition correctly.

Trend following in general— trade price action only. Keep it simple ...buy derivatives on stocks  when they are going up, sell when they are going down. 

I swing trade using monthlies when stocks are breaking out and making new highs after consolidation (see Darvas box system as an example), and trade intra day movers using weeklies. By system— I just meant defining a set of rules that you follow that have an edge, and following those rules to realize the systems positive expectancy; rules for entry, knowing when you are wrong (exits), knowing position sizing, maximum risk, and when to take profits.

Great question to ask yourself.
Yes, normal for this type of company. He presumably has special “founder” shares, the Class B, that have special rights. Those shares probably automatically convert to standard “Class A” shares when sold to the public, because you wouldn’t want an outside shareholder to have shares with special voting rights or whatever. So this is just him converting his option to purchase fancy shares into regular shares so that he can sell them to plebs. Sound right?

> Airbnb was profitable last quarter

Lol. Have you checked why this was the case? Have you even read anything else than Q3 numbers? They are always profitable Q3, but the other quarters pull them down and they so far they have lost money every year. 

They actually warn in their IPO prospectus they could never be profitable.

In May they laid off 25% of its workforce and cut marketing spend for the rest of the year. (Otherwise even Q3 would have been a loss). It was also given an emergency $2bn cash injection from private equity. 

Yearly losses are actually accelarating, started even before the pandemic, revenue is going down as well. You might wanna read wall street journal first before you invest: https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-ipo-filing-shows-profitable-quarter-after-deep-cuts-11605564419

Genuine advice though... its 6 months into a 2 year bull run. It's sitting at around its all time high but the next ones behind it are all at 1/3 - 1/5th their ATH. Go get dem tendies. It'll drop to 17.8 one more time at least before it does another spike. 580 for the #2. And .56 for the number 3.

Put 30k in an account for taxes. Withdrawal 40k and use it as an emergency fund or a down payment on a home if you don't own one. Use the remaining 30k to keep on fucking raking in those tendies. If you lose that you can withdrawal some of that tax money because now you owe less. But it's important and smart to compartmentalize your money so can't yolo it like a dumbass.

I'm at the edge of boomer and millennial. 39 YO. I have a 65 inch TV, PS5, switch, Netflix and some Chinese box that streams movies my wife got. I also got full premium cable and will likely get IPTV for XMAS. As you can guess I am a huge movie buff.

I went to 2 movies during the pandemic when out numbers were low and it was allowed, one with my kids and one with my woman at Ciniplex. The theater was basically completely empty both times (one other family or couple) despite there being only 100 diagnosed cases of covid in a province of 14 million. 

What does that tell me? That people were too afraid to go to the movies possibly? There was not really anything good playing? That people didn't want to be inside during a pandemic?

I think it was a combo of movie theater seemed risky to some and there really wasn't anything good playing. The two movies I went to were spongebob and tenet, both would have been big draws a year before. Nothing else interesting was really released.

At the same time this was happening, beaches and patios were packed so people I think just wanted to be outdoors. Drive through theaters were doing great.

Anyway, I think your post is good. I believe people will go to the movies in a post covid world for a night out as long as something decent is playing. Its an easy date night or even just a night out.

For me, one of the biggest draws of the theater  is 3D movies, IMAX and 4DX. More of an experience than I can get at home and still feels like you did something funner than sit on your couch at home. 

I also had an Xbox party for my kid at the theaters and would do that again despite the first time the girl arranging the party had no idea how to set up the Xbox or even turn on the controllers, kind of to be expected when you give teenagers control of a multi million dollar theater.

Being the best won't bring satisfaction
I'm more worried that Biden will put some sort of National lockdown rules in effect.  I think that the 6 weeks after the inauguration is more worrisome.
If I profit off those, send me your cashapp and I'll send some tendies when I do.

He's right.
Supreme DD post. I’ve been in (shares) since $11.75, staying for the long haul. Use caution playing options on this one; it’s pretty unpredictable.
Bull market now so just get in now and have an exit plan depending on your risk. Pick companies that you think won't die. Even if they go -90% they'll recover type of company.
Worry about it in 3 years?
Yep. Anybody who buys something extremely overvalued like AirBnb at IPO deserves to lose their money. Uber just came back to IPO price after like 18 months.
So what are we talking about? AT&T calls? dumbest idea ever. Comparing  SPACs to mutual funds? Even dumber. God damn. Bottom of the barrel shit today round here. I feel dumber for having showed up. Can I start this thread on fire and run?

This is the way.
Anecdotal evidence - but was in a BBY buying a tv the week of thanksgiving. Was much busier that I expected given 1) there is a pandemic going and 2) BBY seems to be ghost towns in past few years. 

If stimulus gets passed (another $1200 for everyone), expect more TVs and electronics to be bought which is bullish for BBY
Politely----Interested to hear your reasoning for this. 

Buying 5 calls back is much less cheaper than purchasing another 500 shares to cover...especially if its mooning.

I might just buy back the calls at a loss and sell some puts to break even on and still get to keep my original shares. 

Your thoughts?
Every attempt has been declined? Guess you don’t actually watch the hearing. Trumps campaign only filed 3 lawsuits which haven’t been declined. They’re doing forensic audits of ballots and the machines now you dolt.
thanks for the advice, sorry for the boomer question
Ok
So my understanding is that holding a stock for a year or longer decreases tax liability on profits. That true with option contracts as well? Have some 12/18/21 leaps. If I didn't cash them in until after a year had gone by owning them, are there fewer taxes?
Well fuck.

You equated the acquisition companies targeting one company with a $10 price floor for redemption with a mutual fund that usually owns dozens or hundreds of securities and has nothing to do with mergers and acquisitions.

BRK is fine but it doesn’t mean those investment vehicles are equivalent
Also save around 40k for the tax man unless you plan on losing it all.

Selling calls next week. Noob Robin Hood traders piling in before EOY, great time to collect premium on over inflated names. Selling Jan TSLA calls in droves $550 -$700, however high these Dorks will pay the premium for them. Also offering $20-30 PLTR calls for January, stock should slide sub $20 within a few weeks. EZ money 💰😝
Oh nice. Are you working more? For about half the year we got less money to avoid layoffs.

I had that many trades last week and made like $18.  Now what?  Gonna investigate me?  You'd only learn i'm lying and actually lost 5k
An even more precise  definition:

Lenders underwrite the mortgages to conform to Fannie/Freddie Guidelines so they can be sold in the Secondary Market. Fannie/Freddie do not buy the loans themselves, they merely guarantee the performance of these Loans to investors. Fannie/Freddie operate as Insurers of Investment quality to a robust market can exist without banks having to keep everything on their own books.
Isn’t that a game of thrones thing?
It’ll moon for a bit. But then reality will hit that there’s no way to maintain consistent growth and it has no scalable revenue stream and it will crash back down to earth.
Nah mate, I sold like 150 CC’s yesterday for 12/11 expiry and then IV crush. Then I’ll buy more shares and calls with the funds.

RKT actually started trading close to IPO price. What are you talking about. More like dont jinxing it, don't pull a lyft.
It's an MLM. Fuck that
Nice initiative, but honestly i don't think a bit of a selloff would ruin anything - just look what happened after the Q2 earnings. A bit of a correction and then all the way up again, no matter what.

We'll only need a catalyst and hopefully Cohen will do his part well.

You could buy into EDIT NTLA CRSP (original 3) and BEAM. This is just the start, though keep a healthy time horizon. We recently had a lot of traction, especially with the Nobel being awarded, people are starting to get aware it exists. Though we are still at the early innings of the S Curve. It's far from to late mid/long term, short term I think they will stabilize somewhat and reach parity sp wise, with the risk of a small retest.
Hope y’all loaded up on PFE calls. They are going to make millionaires next week
You pay a manager handsomely to buy shit for you, and hope that they don’t tell their bro in law about the acquisition target(s) beforehand.  If it’s diversified like BRK that seems better than having them yolo it for you on one stonk
I'm trying to learn how calls work.  When he places this call for sale, someone has to buy it right? And they pay the $1485 for it?

Cramer acknowledged that retards and autistic investors are the new market movers
🚀 = 1000% gainer, I am in
Always been so easy to make money on the market or 2020 is different? Im New to this but ive seen bull run for over couple months with little pullback.. meme stocks, ev, tech. Even if you just buy shares and hold you would make profit. Is this normal?
Airbnb has only consolidated gains over hotels due to COVID. People used to think renting a house from a stranger was dangerous. Now it’s safer than a hotel. Let that sink in.

How is it silly to say that in one of Hilton’s earliest international countries they have two properties, neither in a major city, for a country of over 95.54 million people? Sure people may have heard of it once but there are tens of thousands of Airbnb hosts in Vietnam and the number of rentals per year must be easily 100x to 1000x of Hilton

Of course local people will be more familiar with the Airbnb brand than Hilton. That’s why Hilton is regional. They only have density in North America. 

So to the original poster’s point, yes if you have 100 to 1000x the rentals of Hilton on most continents with a much faster growth rate than your business is going to be worth a lot more than theirs. There are numerous articles discussing this. Not to mention way less downside risk since you don’t own the properties.
I have that.

Very reasonable. However, opening up the market to US investors provides a much bigger market.

Not one US media outlet has talked about the stock. Volume is around 70,000 daily. I would say that’s pretty under the radar.
Interesting. Whatever. I can't agree with all you retards on everything. Autist gonna be autistic I guess.

NIO gonna run this week.
well that gets into a discussion which is polarizing, I'm with you in saying that you can't go solo camera and RADAR withou LiDAR, but at the same time, i'm not going to discount tesla if they think they can do it without one.

Basically, with the data they are getting, if a camera only solution is possible, tesla will be the one to figure it out

As far as collecting data, yes, waymo might have higher fidelity data, but tesla has data from production sensors. And a lot more of it. 

The second thing is that you are comparing an engineering project to a mass produced vehicle. I was with a supplier that actually outfitted some of their Pacifica's in 2017, and i can tell you what we did for them was extremely custom, and that was part of the guts of the vehicle.

Then the third question becomes how are you valuing understanding human driving habits, because i'm sure you'll admit that that too is important to understand. 

The question becomes can tesla figure out the no lidar approach before waymo figures out  how to productionize their system? which may all be a moot point because IIRC, someone/somewhere mentioned that waymo was trying to be a software/hardware supplier as opposed to actually competing themselves.

Yeah I didn't mention the sex to avoid people thinking my comment was just a hang-up on nudity or something, but the writers seemed pretty obsessed with unconventional sexual dynamics and wasted **a lot** of time on those relationships.

You've got:

* the gay relationship with one of the guys being in the closet and wanting to stay with his girlfriend

* a feminine girl cheating on her live in boyfriend and being a submissive coffee girl at work while being sexually dominant with coworkers

* the main character who's hung up on her ex boyfriend, pays for favors with sex, and uses sex to entice clients when convenient but is super offended by them wanting sex when she doesn't need something from them.

And I'm downplaying the alt-weirdness a little bit with those descriptions - for instance the "dominant girl" wanks off the dude who likes her in the bathroom and then makes him eat his cum off the mirror.

Ken Leung and Freya Mavor's characters (Eric and Daria) were great because they didn't have the high school level interpersonal drama plotlines like the younger intern characters, but they didn't have enough scenes to pull the show out of the gutter.

City folk want to move out of their cities since indoor bars and venues are all fucked and/or shutting down, this will drive up suburban housing prices. Suburban folk seeing this increase in price as well as city trash and a growing rage/disdain towards their schooling systems that fucked them by shutting down will turn to a quieter life in a nice rural area. Rural farmers pissed off by the new suburban trash that is infesting their lands, will look for new opportunities in the vacant cities.

How many shares are we talking about?  If you have hundreds, set them at intervals  starting at 50, 75, 100, 125, ans so forth.  

If you have dozens.  Just set at what price you are willing to be happy at selling.   I don't see this happening in the matters of minutes or seconds.  You'll have a couple of hours to figure out when you want to cash out and still be safely +500% to +1000% up.  If you want to time the +10000% holy grail, that'll require balls of steel, hands of diamonds, and plain luck.  Personally, I'm happy with +500%.  So half my shares are at $100.  The others randomly set ($69, $420, etc).
I trade for a living lol. How do you think I can afford a $10,000 gamble lmao. This is nothing. I’m about to buy a Mclaren this spring

You could have bought shares with this and settled
Yeah I’m buying a house in a few months so I figured losing 8k would probably slow that down a bit. I turned $400 into 10k so I’m sure I can start small again with 2k and try to make some profit

Hotels operated at very high margins prior to COVID, and they can cut rates back quite a bit to be more competitive with AirBnb. You already see it with adding free Breakfast and a bunch of things they were charging for prior to distinguish themselves.

I'm not arguing against the idea of "Vacation Rentals" in general, which you seem to think I am. I am saying AirBnb isn't a unicorn like it was two years ago, and is more of a pedestrian IPO in 2020.
As an E6 guy I thought the same thing 😂
Wish I could make money off of Roblox shitting the bed now.
Good job. I too also cash out after making back all my losses. I want my end game to have a profit and not because I lost all my money.

$35 billion lost on Tesla shorts this year. Thanks for your service
Average in and average out dont get you laid bro
Except when I bought calls on battery day
Holy shit. I was just kidding. Who knew. Thanks
Yes I have and my career in financial education and empowerment is a choice I made because if I can help anyone avoid some things I experienced then I can feel good about that.

You are asserting that people are addicts and alcoholics and this is the essence of who they are. If that's the case then I wouldn't be where I am today with some education and support. Put them in a room and give them their vices as if they are rats to be hidden away from society? That's one of the most fucked up things I have ever heard.

I hope you actually are trying to do good and I hope you continue to meet people where they are to find out the roots of these issues. Looking at people as a sum of their current state is gross and hope this is a bad idea you look at someday and go "wtf was I thinking ".
Just went all in in $XPEV, do you have a corner for me? I don't take much place
More XOM calls. I’m up a fuck ton, but it’s about to get real. 

Any autist not in oil right now may actually be retarded.

Without getting into the technicals of output declines in the Permian, we are literally about to reopen the entire fucking world. People just bought a ton of trucks and RVs. Bank accounts for the upper middle class and above (those who travel) are fatter than ever. People will be traveling like crazy. 

Don’t give me the electric car shit, anyone who isn’t fully retarded knows that even if Tesla and company quadrupled next year, which won’t happen, they still wouldn’t make a dent in global oil demand. 

By next summer, oil will be $65+ and XOM will be $70.

I loaded up on 2023 XOM $55 calls.
RemindMe! 5 years
Are you long on your shares?

I’m down on 700 shares. Planning to continue selling calls weekly and hold these for a while.
Don't you mean your kid?..
your contribution limit is the sum of available contributions each year since you turned 18. Thats the max you can put in your TFSA. Whatever gains you make inside are tax free as long as its not day trading. If you withdraw a portion - that portion is refreshed as available contribution next year. If you lose money - that contribution room is gone. 
ex. You had 50k available contribution for TFSA, you deposited, yolod in options, lost it, contribution is gone. You have to wait next year to get your next 5-6k contribution available.
Selling anytime before May 2021 makes absolutely zero sense. Average down your cost per share and buy more if its like 1 dollar or less than your average, but selling is ignorant if you're in it for the squeeze.
Congrats you were rewarded with the great gift of gambling addiction! Make sure you manage your bankroll enough so whatever happens you still have a cell phone and some play money.  Doesnt matter if you buy calls from a cardboard box in the future.

This is the way!
It's like an inside joke. Happy to be part of one
But you can bet everyone else is going to be on it right out the gates. Meaning it's going to be priced ridiculously high then inevitably dip in the future. I'd wait until then.
I’m bullish. Holding calls. For obvious reasons.
This would not make it in technical analysis of financial markets book by Murphy. This your 3 year version of support and resistance?

I’m too lazy to answer this question.
Im waiting to buy tsla 700/750 or 750/800 spreads. Might be time this week. Ahead of sp inclusion you can spend about 800-1k and payoff is 4k per spread. 

Not amazing but if the action hits iv should grow, will want to have purchased already
First week of January $100-110
Tesla getting added to s&p500 was a good move right on time before a big correction. I guess  Q1 will be the big bang, also shorting a cult is hard but possible.

I think 2 things will happen

1. Other car companies will exceed or atleast be on the same level as Tesla next year and they will announce it. (Volkswagen)
2. Q reports show sales dropping.

So TSLA has been in a semi-short squeeze all year 😂
Either 55 or 35

That’s the spirit.. already betting again!
It's so obvious you have never been in a Tesla and certainly don't own one. I don't waste my time on Reddit arguing for arguing's sake. I'll take the long, you take the short and I'll set a reminder in 5yrs so we can compare gains.

Read my initial comment for clarity regarding my “argument.”

Also, answer the above question without vomiting words in a comment.

Also (part 2),  I didn’t say anything about the size of the bond market. And for gods sake don’t call it “physically twice,” that absolutely makes no sense. If it were twice the size it most certainly is not “physically” twice the size. Bombers stored in a computer do not take much physical space. 

I’m calling your initial statement about how GS doesn’t talk about their bond desk, which they do, and that their equities desk is more relevant, which it isn’t. My issue isn’t with how valuable you find Rick, I frankly don’t care. But you making broad statement about institutions you have only topical knowledge on is the first sign of ignorance. Notice how I didn’t call you stupid, but just ignorant. With the latter being evident from your string of comments.

I'm no expert, but this is the same mindset I have about the situation. More competition generally results in less revenue for the prior existing companies.

NIO predictions this week??
Look at the YTD change. The vast majority of the 6-figure losses were just prior gains.
Nah man you should still feel shitty
Have a bad feeling about LAZR, will not be playing 🤷‍♂️
SC
The play on pltr imo was buying some stock, selling calls. Also selling puts ( iv is high )  then using the premium for far otm calls.

The iv has come off some now, so look for vol to signal call buying.

Problem is if we get a massive insider dump. 

This company despite being newish to the market has been around and has a product and customers. Definitely worse plays imo.

Oh dude, Monday at open. Don’t even bother dating them for a couple weeks after the inclusion. And go really really far OTM. Like $420p. Date it before the inclusion, probably that Friday right before, the 18th I think. Any run up beforehand is just a dead cat bounce. You and Burry are going to make bank on these “poots.”
What do you think the dot com bubble was?
Teach me your ways my son
This was me recently.

I was up like 70% on the year (only a few grand in my case) but I had a friend who was really struggling. Pulled out some profits to help him get back on his feet. Good thing I did, because Monday and Tuesday happened right after and I lost like 50% of my gains in two days.

So the way I see it, if I can loss a couple grand in a day or two, I can afford a 1/4 of that to help a friend out, right?

Moved the rest of my gains into GME stock, like a good retard. Waiting for the Moon.

Haha all the indicators point to it happening in the near future. Could be early or could be late. I'm just gonna ride the bull market for now and start to scale back my positions and/or start hedging more
There is: SPAK
Basically there is an optimal delta/gamma combination for the most gains in a a particular day based on movement.  As a general rule of thumb ATM options will end up generating the most gain, but in special scenarios such as yuuuuge moves that spike the IV into the stratosphere, OTM options benefit more.  So just buy ATM or very slightly OTM if you expect a bigger move, and add some lottos in the mix if you have reason to believe some crazy shit could happen.  Long term OTM doesn’t make a ton of sense as you could just have been rolling up your ATM strikes as you go for more gains.

Why are you comparing a 10 year old company with tens of millions of rentals at every price bracket in every country to upscale hotel brands like the Ritz with 100 total locations after 37 years? Valuation is based on growth rate you know?

My point is the Hilton which is one of America’s largest brand has literally 2 hotels of any caliber in all of Vietnam and similar for many other countries. These brands cannot compete because they are too slow, new hotels are too expensive, the risks of overbuilding are too high, and local competitors can do it cheaper and with better connections.

And I literally on the street that's named after a great man which happens to run most similar areas.

I'm currently in the mist of finishing remodeling and going to sell my houses at a discount to non-investors, encouraging  black ownership.

Have you ever been on welfare? Do you live in a similar place, day in and day out? You don't know the half of it.
I’ve got shares. What’s the play?
First don’t. Second try paper trading first for options. Just get a feel for what you’re doing. You can buy a stock first like an IPO or another stock that’s mooning. If you do anything with options just buy In The Money calls to start with and only do 1 contract and watch the stock and option price move. Keep news alerts on everywhere you can for the stock and the market. And then when you feel more comfortable try trading a little more. There’s better places to read options strategies online than Investopia. Just Google it good luck bro

Dude, when you get a mortgage originated from the bank, they specifically tailor it so it can be resold on the Secondary Mortgage Market. The bank you originate with is almost never the Bank that holds your mortgage. 

They sell it to Fannie or Freddie so it can be repackaged and sold to investors

The BEST way to avoid taxes (legally) is to lose money.  I bought Lucent (long) the day they split from AT&T, at a split adjusted cost of 7 bucks.  Watched it go to 80, then the tech bubble burst.  I didn't sell because of taxes I'd have to pay.  When it started dropping, I rationalized that it was "only the taxes I was down anyway, so.........hang on".  It eventually went to zero, and I avoided ALL taxes on it.

I've learned that taxes are a cost of doing business.

Tesla has sold 0 batteries or drive trains to other companies. All these other businesses generate 0 revenue.

Most innovative company in our lifetime? Sweet Jesus dude how can you even see the keyboard with Elon's balls in your mouth. Google is by far the most innovative company in our lifetime. Google completely changed how the internet is hosted overall. Google changed how we even browse and search the web with Chrome and search. They also created the basics of online advertising and keyword advertising. They created the best e-mail in the world with Gmail. They developed Borg which became Kubernetes and is now how almost all companies run their software or aspire to run their software. They created level 4 driverless cars unlike Tesla. They created Android then opensourced the shit so they can beat the iPhone and they ended up with a larger market share despite having to play catch up. I could go on and on and on but it's not even close. Tesla created cars with bigger batteries and then tried to make it FSD despite it not being possible. LMAO. BTW here are a BMW and a fucking Kia doing the same shit as Tesla:

This week we go to $650 or $700
It wasn't too bad; I was up $2000 in a week but I just got greedy and didn't sell when I knew I should have. I should have realized that was the end of the run ups. But I'm back at starting thanks to $LAZR. Decided to sell out for quick $400 in 2 hours while at work yesterday.
Good DD. So what are your predictions for next week? will go sideways or should I hold onto my bleeding 12/18 & 12/24 calls and expect a bull run?
We were seeing insane housing construction growth before the pandemic and its now gone back to crazy levels I think it’s just a decent play long term with rates and that combined. Hate to say it but shares wouldn’t be the worst here

There isn’t really a good answer, but I don’t agree with the idea that some businesses are essential while others are not. Sure the grocery store and doctors office is essential, but there are a fuck ton of “essential” businesses that aren’t essential at all.
So first one tesla trade and then apple. Those two are swing trades or entered on a day it’s about to blast off..? Did you hold over night?? Just those trades only or any other trades as well to put this at 20X return in one month.

Only the ones you’ve never heard of. Maybe Huawei, but that’s it.
Yeah but those countries are starting to realize they have been fucked by Chinese lenders. Loans are becoming due. Chinese companies are becoming resented by locals as they muscle their way into the economy with no government oversight (because so much money is owed). East and central Africa is not nearly as China friendly as it used to be even 5 years ago. The more China extracts from these countries the more it will face the same resentment Britain and France faced in the early-mid 1900s.

I think it will be good long term, but most people don’t have access to it at the IPO price, so a lot of these take off immediately and then come back to earth a bit before going back up.  Also a bit silly to think that everyone isn’t already talking about this IPO, and that not referring to it by name on Reddit makes a difference in what’s going to happen to the IPO price.
Exaxtly. They are all solid companies stock wise. Now option wise he's probably fucked unless it's longer than 3 months out.

Donate it to a food bank and it lowers your tax liability.
You have a very very narrow world view as I said and you confirmed with this ridiculous shit.

"Their cities" - you already have it wrong my friend. 

Poverty as a choice is not the norm but I'm sure you can cherry pick stories to confirm your bias. I work directly with communities around development issues that prevent economic participation and empowerment. Your idea that this is some simple issue and people just choose their lot in life is lie your corporate overlords have sold you.

I disagree. As someone who's studied both computer vision and robotics mapping techniques, the particle filter approach of lidar isn't better than a convolutional neural network. Particle filters are easier to implement, but they also require a lot of subtle fine tuning when dealing with noise.
Sounds like a fairly mediocre options trader

Buying while dipping way to go. Never gonna be below 20$
It won't happen in our lifetime. Maybe in 200-300 years, who knows.
why not create a call debit spread and lower your entry cost into the options? Buy the 20c and sell the 25c, just buy more contracts. Lowers your break even point and realistically caps your profits.
Yeah saw that timeline. Had hope I’d get a early exit gift on my shares
Curis is also reporting on December 8. Any thoughts?
Btw have you heard of our lord and savior PLTR?
I can hear Kenny from the miller’s
As technology becomes more and more advanced, and tens of millions of lower level jobs are lost to automation and AI, the implementation of a UBI is not just a good idea but is 100% required. There literally won’t be nearly enough jobs on the market. Also, Ackman’s suggestion is far from a UBI, 6 grand over the course of 65 years is practically nothing and would serve as an effective stimulus to help the lower and middle class.

I don’t necessarily support one now, but the conversation needs to get started due to the decades it takes anything to get done in this country.
This is the easiest play of December. Those who miss it will FOMO in at 2.5x the price just like Palantir
example?
Looks like it’s too late IV is 220 now
I made a reddit acct for the sole purpose of saying this but never did
This is wholly not true; options provide you the ability to manage and mitigate losses on a timed investment. 100 shares can take a larger loss than a single options call expiring OTM.

That is why premiums exist; you pay for the ability to exercise the option, but not the obligation. Shares can have losses that are unlimited (til 0.00 value). Options will only ever lose you the premium if you're buying.

Just saw a post on Twitter with year end price targets on the S&P from the big banks from back in April. Most of them are around 3000. Lololololol
I don't think people were pissed about senators selling in March. It was the fact that they were publicly downplaying the risks of the virus while privately profiting. That's shady as fuck when you hold public office and are supposed to help your constituents. By downplaying the virus in the early stages these greedy fucks were putting their personal profits above the actual health and safety of Americans.
Analysts already saying $75+ and they actually read the S-1 so why do we trust your valuation more?

No I’m going to do take out for some of my favorite restaurants to help them, even if it’s a little help, cause our government won’t
I’m certain that they’ve throttled shipments. It’s a very good strategy to get more people paying full price for a longer period of time. Seeing consoles go for $1000 on eBay makes people far more amiable to buying one for $500 at retail.
I think it’s unlikely that they are participating in the price gouging though
Someone will get rich off it, might as well be you...

That’s a good dividend play. Unfortunately, it is too expensive for most of us to get into now. I wish I would’ve bought some back in March.

it’s over bulls! 😎☝️
Crack it is. Never can tell anymore.

This was actually on my radar for a while, as I first used the company last month.
Actually the continued shut downs and draconian efforts to control people all under the guise of controlling the spread of a virus that been in the wild for almost a year will crash the economy.  Shutdowns aren’t working but it’s helping line the pockets of big corporations so they want more.   At some point we have to admit that lock downs aren’t working.  Mainly because you’ll never get 100% compliance.   If they really worked then big box stores would also be forced to close too.  Many small businesses are on the brink of failure.
Asking a lot.  Short version:
I use free shipping.com.  they charge you $12 a month for a service that gets you 10% cash back at most retailers (not Amazon).  If your order goes through and is then cancelled, sometimes you still get the cash back. I don't try to abuse this as it is unpredictable or at least I haven't tried to discern a pattern.  Also, you are limited to $1000 cash back per year.  They also refund shipping costs if you order from somewhere that charges shipping.

In this case, best buy cancelled my order repeatedly due to some issues on their end (they were out of stock of the open box one, then when I tried again they said I had ordered more than the limit).  So, I had my wife place the order. Each time, I went through the click through cash back site.   I even talked to a rep at the cash back site to say those orders got cancelled and she was very nice and told me from their end, it looks like they went through and left them in the system.
I actually wouldn’t be surprised if he bought a ton of puts and told all his buddies to... ngl I might buy some just in case FDs
I am gonna make accounts predicting the crash every month then and when it hits imma jerk off to my wsb upvotes from my bunker

Here are the TWO Hilton’s in all of Vietnam and they’re both in Da Nang with two more under construction: https://www.hilton.com/en/locations/vietnam/

And that’s a country they have been in a LONG time (you may remember the famous Hanoi Hilton)

They have two locations in one town that most Americans have barely even heard of. People who are really into where they stay are either staying at unique non-American hotels like the Metropole Hanoi or Airbnb.

So yes Airbnb clearly has a higher brand cache in Vietnam than Hilton with 2 hotels in one city lol. I’ve looked at many other international countries and the story is usually similar unless it’s a place like Tokyo where they want to show off and build a few expensive properties.
Yeah I agree with you. Don’t put yourself in a spot where your options expiring worthless means you have to start going to the soup kitchen. But you have to take SOME risk to even go 5x with any amount as you’ve described. The people who advocate “boomer investing” like parking your money in mutual funds or shares of blue chip stock was what I was getting at “never reaching Pluto in their 20s”. Because you’ll never go 5x that way in anything less than 50 years. And ironically I know plenty of boomers who lost money because they parked large sums of money with Bernie Madoff or held many shares of “blue chip” companies like Enron back in the day.
...-0.01%?
Who do you listen to tho?
Please for the love of god sell some before earnings to lock in gains before it tanks if they don’t announce any stellar guidance.  Long calls and shares are literally free money.
This is the way

And only your first.
Nah brah the man that proposed to eat shit had you beat big time

Ohhh... well make sure to not buy any more calls from these companies or else you're gonna deal with wash sales rules. AKA not able to deduct these loses from your capital gains this year's taxes. I sold all my positions and will stay out of the market for at least 60 days.
That's why you need 💎👐
This is far different from the PLTR situation. PLTR was pure momentum and hype, GME has a fundamental aspect to it as well as an array of upcoming catalysts.
6 years? Bro they have made so much progress in that time lol why would t you just be a fan and have made 10x by now.. enjoy your salt while Elon eats filet

I'd personally advise rolling those into spreads dated out til at least end of December but probably January (taxes and shit). Personal bias is that a bad market headwind will hit IWM the hardest but I'm not a financial advisor!!

The vacation town i live in is slowly starting to push out these rentals by taxing them more and says they'll eventually ban airbb. The major vacation rental companies have got into local politics mainly because of this. It has also effected our longterm rentals and the blue collar workers have had to move farther out making the workforce smaller and making things more expensive. Fuck airbb
Boomer?
If you have tolerance for gayness I think RKT leaps isn’t a bad call. 3/19 20c looks pretty tasty for 2.91 a contract and 3/19 25c is 1.65

Shit I take it back 9/17/21 20c for 4.68 looks like a complete winner lol
Remember idiots: Always do your own research before taking advice from a retard on the internet.
Thanks for this. I have been bettering myself the past few months. Meditating every day, exercising (in the best shape of my life), eating right, spending time with family. It's all been rewarding; I've just been lonely. My lifestyle before covid was dating lots of women but now it's been months since I've been with one since I've been working on myself.

I know this won't last I guess I was just fretting. Thanks for listening man.
If you start hitting a million+ net, you should really start considering going boring mode again with much of the gains. Earning the equivalent of a light US salary in dividends that is basically impossible to permanently lose is life changing. Have basic needs paid for by boomer funds, yolo with money after that.

While we stopped to refuel, I noticed Andrew left and his citron goons gyrating near our ship. General Cramer was in the distance with his pinky resting on his mouth. I suspected foul play and tried to warn the others we should get moving soon. I was willing to inject 200k space dollars toward fuel so we could get a move on but was brutally attacked by my own, so I decided to take my space dollars and hop onto another. As I was flying away in the millennium blackberry, I couldn’t help to think of all the rebels I ditched back at pltr enterprise.  It had to be done though because the force was not in them figuratively, but only literally up their ass.

Need SPY to move from ~369.25 to $382 by 12/11, or only +3.45% in a week for a 10x gain...

during Vaccine Week^TM ?
SPAC go big uppies.
r/Stocks would definitely be mondo burger...
I’ll be trimming some of my calls right before earnings to lock in gains but selling shares is not the move at all
You price pork futures to low, ban. You price chicken futures to high? Also ban. Under over see? We have the best traders in the world. Because of ban.
Could be a double top as well
RKT $30 end of week 🚀🚀🚀
I think the idea is that over 3yrs with $400k+ lost in tuition you should have learned more than *"oh well I'm rich so I can afford to throw another $100k on the craps table"*.

And it isn't extraordinary risk, it's just proportionally higher amounts due to a higher net worth. Occasionally we get million+ dollar accounts posting $100k-500k stock gains like it's impressive, same thing.

There was definitely some bullish action towards the end. But this stock seems too bizzare for any predictions.
Next dividend is coming up in ~1 month, your timing might be okay, just expect it to act real weird

Set a price target and sell when it hits it, keep in mind T hasn't seen 30 since July

No. I'm up 70% for the year. This is security money for my family in case we lose our jobs. I need to profit more.
Sell? I'm buying more. We should shoot to 10% ownership

I think the FSLY buyout rumor is bullshit and probably started from a Twitter account. That said though, it is odd that neither CSCO nor FSLY have come out to deny these rumors.

It was one of the top stories yesterday.
ABNB is definitely not undervalued, so it probably still goes up, but it's not an obvious play either way.

I sold out my few small EV positions because I FOMOd. I used GME and TRIL.TO to leverage my losses and restarted my positions so my overall loses weren't to bad.

I have some puts on GME, and will buy the dip if it happens to look appealing after earnings. I hope I lose my few hundred in calls so all the autists here make it big, because ima feel bad when a market correction happens. We saw the PLTR loss porn, with people losing hundreds of thousands in a day. Hoping it isnt the same for GME autists

These are my first calls so I only bought ten contracts but I'm excited.
Yeah, you basically get someone else to pay for part of your calls and you'll feel safe knowing that if the ship goes down, you're not alone.
Lets hope you are right, bro! Bought back in because of you ;)
Deflationary scam?  I guess buying billions in corporate bonds is just a joke to you?
What I mean by that is that theres no local Amazon, many countries in EU actually dont have it. Ofc I can order something from Spain, UK or German amazon but theres nothing local here. People just use Alibaba here instead becuz Russians rly like it for some reason. Even tho they actually sell so much worthless shit.

You can go to Pluto without risking your life savings. I GUARANTEE you most the pluto type stories you see here didn't actually risk their entire life savings. You make calculated guesses with 1k or below. If you hit once it allows you to do it like 5x again. If you go on a streak you can hit pretty big. So you take out some to save it and play with the last 10k. If you lose that 10k it's back to 1k educated guesses. You rinse and repeat this cycle and you get to pluto. Thats how you get true success doing this type of stuff. I feel like this needs to really be said in this sub.

So are you saying it's a better trade to short calls in SNOW than other stocks? If so that's even a better reason to say sell some OTM calls since I don't even mind the assignment. I mean I'm gonna choose a 20%+ OTM call, not an ATM one but even the 20% OTM ones have some good premium. I rarely try this but on ZM and MRNA after the rip, it's been decent. Just trying to expand strategies. It's not a constant thing I'll always do since I know in general stocks go up.

4) New policy on taxes (also affecting corporations bottom line)

5) Commercial space default/loss of revenue

These have yet to be factored into the market.

Apple will probably make you use a butt plug as a safety measure or something.
For those of you saying NIO and CRSR ships have sailed must actually be retarded. They both had great run ups, and now 30% of the top has been taken and they’re consolidating. This is when you BUY because in two fucking weeks when everyone is pissed that they didn’t get in they’re gonna ask why and it’s because they never fucking buy when they’re sideways or dropping a little they always buy on the end side of the hype. So shut the fuck up and go long about a month out on these two 💎. Thank me later
dang I feel the pain brother.

GME @ 17.9 so $18 

APHA @ 8.50 


but I’m confident both of these will print money if we stay strong, APHA not so much as GME but I think Morningstar has a fair price around $11 and the cannabis tides are changing for sure.

Their ipo price is pretty high. 90-95 dollars right?
You still have to find others who think the stock is a good idea. Stocks don’t magically become undervalued. There’s a reason it’s stayed there

I mainly look for 2 things. Not on a steady decline prior to covid and in recent quarters a rev climb. 

Of course as we all know, profits don't mean shi when it comes to valuations.
Apple has had minimal revenue growth to accompany their meteoric rise in share price. 

Honestly, big tech has just replaced bonds as the risk free rate. As soon as the Fed unwinds the balance sheet and yields go up, that's what will cause the deleveraging. Just look at December 2018.

APPL will be the largest auto manufacture in US they will start their EV car production before 2025 and by 2035 apple's car will make TSLA cars looks like old ford car. TSM will provide chips for their car. So every month buy APPL shares and 5% for YOLO this is the way.

And even worse they usually have upvotes. The aren’t kidding when they say this sub is full of degenerate gamblers who don’t understand the most basic shit about how companies are valued.
I feel so welcomed😌
I definitely do.  The pandemic has been incredible for me financially and I know a lot of people are hurting because it had the opposite effect.  It's somewhat ridiculous that I've been able to make more than many do in a year having not done a single bit of actual productive work for it.

It's helped a bit to give back to my community in various ways, but it still hasn't eliminated it entirely.  It has made it pretty obvious that this structure isn't the optimal one for the advancement of humanity, but game theory would suggest that not participating, given the chance, is a bad strategy.
This is what I was thinking , I would add more if we had another significant dip like in September

With much of the country locking down again. Sounds like a particularly tasty brand of retarded. Count me in!
Airbnb has tens of millions of properties versus 100 Ritz Carltons. You’re thinking way too small. Sure some rich Americans love to go to Bangkok and get almost the same experience they’d get in London and will pay out the ass for that. But 99% of people aren’t even going somewhere that has a Ritz and 99% of those people aren’t choosing a Ritz even if they do pick one of the places that has one.

And most people might to to a Ritz for what a few nights or at most a week or two a year (unless they constantly travel for work)? People literally live in Airbnbs now. Want to live in a different city every month for much cheaper than the Ritz even if there is no Ritz even in that country? Easy. Don’t want to sign a long term lease for whatever reason, Airbnb again. Want to have a full kitchen and a driveway? Airbnb

You’re comparing a business that relies on building huge hotel buildings over years in new locations to one that literally just adds a new computer server (using autoscaling so no humans needed) when they need to handle more bookings.

Marriott and the others tried to expand faster and then the pandemic hit and destroyed them. That’s the risk of a capital heavy business model and it blew up in their face.
Without reading that thread I'm gonna take a wild guess their advice was don't YOLO $20k on meme stocks.

What the fuck is this shit.
But it doesn't exist. Tesla FSD is not full self-driving or even close. It is assisted driving not full self-driving. This is a very important distinction. 

From their site:
"The future use of these features without supervision is dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving capabilities are introduced, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates."

So clearly it is not FSD or even close. How can you achieve FSD without testing FSD? They don't have live level 4 FSD testing ongoing anywhere on open roads. Other companies do already have that. Betting on Tesla being worth more in the future means full FSD is working in 5 years and robotaxis are a thing because that's what it is priced for now. If those don't exist it won't be worth more. 

Mass retardation and delusion can win out short term, but in the longterm, as deliveries are missed, recalls of vehicles continue to happen(by the way did you know Tesla has had to recall over 60000 vehicles this year due to safety concerns? Doesn't sound like much until you realize they only sold 300k cars this year and 1000000 total as of March 20th 2020 so counting only the recalls from 2020 it means 4.6% of their total vehicles have had to be recalled), the tech seems less and less realistic, and others actually do deliver meaningfully on the FSD promise people will wake up and sell offs will begin. Also part of why a big sell-off hasn't happened is taxes. If Tesla corrected to 200$ tomorrow most people still wouldn't lose more money than they'd lose if they sold it without holding for 2 years to hit capital gains 15% tax status.

So again copy pasting what the CEO of a publicly traded company said about his stock price increasing doesn't mean shit.

"On ROBINHOOD?"
Very true, the price range sucks if you trade equity. I only trade with price action and using option as trading vehicle. The trading volume has been high mainly due to people speculating on vaccine distribution IMO.  Tech did decent last week and  we all saw what happened to EV stocks. We will see which sector can bring the heat next week. We should see more money coming in on all the pot stocks.

I had 6.5’s pre announcement that mooned to 3000%. Decided to start the call chain and then it dumped. Avg down and bought a fuck ton of 7.5’a next day expiry. It happens man, never sell always avg down- we get a seat at the table or we dine in hell

Sell TSLA 500p weeklies. Even if it does go below 500 (I think it definitely wont) u will get assigned 100 Tsla shares, and you can sell covered calls with that assignment. It literally cannot go tits up

Yeah, AirBnb is a tough one for me to buy as well. Clearly the service itself is here to stay, but as more and more cities regulate them it's probably not even as valuable as it was 2 years ago. Not to mention they have a lot of competition now, and it's not hard to find nightly rental condos and apartments using other methods. As an experienced traveler is outside his home city for like 2 months per year , I haven't used AirBnb in like 3 years.

IMO, AirBnb really fucked up by not having an IPO during mid 2018, as they were hot at that time and were clearly the best of the group. Now they aren't really providing as much value, and frankly the experience is way more expensive and more underwhelming than it used to be.
I made money because I got in at 16 and got out at 27. It’s all the people who FOMO’d in way too late that are bag holding.

Walk street bets is a lot like a venture capital firm.

We can raise or drop the share of a price through repeated memes, and because of that, we can get a large amount of money in a limited amount of time.

However, because we are not a unified company, we have literally no idea when everyone will sell, so the retarded bears amongst us can also fuck the price up too.

You lay off Nonna. She's a treasure.
it lets you buy for 11.50. But there restricted for a while. So you cant profit untill the stock is trading at its normal levels. But i think you can short it when its super high to lock in your gains. I would youtube how to take profit in this situation i guess.

I don't think it's realistic to compare it with Yahoo. Yahoo was already a failing company whose CEO was busy being pregnant or posing for fashion magazines instead of doing due diligence on what company to purchase. Salesforce is a thriving company and has made good acquisition decisions before (Tableau, Mulesoft, etc).

You have to search his previous posts in 25 days ago he gave up pumping that idea it's only on Apple and it cost $5 for a premium subscription to him because the data he is buying to get this everyday cost $3,500 a month and he took a long time and stuff to be able to get that price point even.

On the phone with RBC, sold 500 shares of CRSR and it didn’t go through so I sold another 500. Effectively I had -500 shares. For some reason my account was going up and I was confused because this account doesn’t allow shorting. Guy told me I shit you not “sir, the basic rules of stocks are to buy low and sell high” I’ve never been so god damn mad, told him to go fuck himself after he fixed my account. In short I ended up shorting Corsair by accident with shares and then bought them back at a lower price to stabilize my account. Made like 8k by accident lol. True retard here

Georgia is bad with covid now but it’s getting worse. The Dem cities: people wear masks, practice social distancing, we’re working from home and isolating. In the rural towns that are deep red, they’re not at all. They’re holding Christmas parties and events. They’re killing themselves and also not voting. Seems like Dems could scratch out two wins in a best case if they vote. And the early voting / vote by mail is sticking. We like that. It’ll be tight but it’s not certain the GOP holds the Senate at all.

Interactive Brokers has the best fee if you're going to be trading often enough that the $10/month inactivity fee won't be an issue (waived if you pay $10+ in commisions anyways or if you have US$100K)

**and even then**, inactivity fee is literal peanuts compared to paying $9.99/trade. Not to mention a regular broker charges like $9.99 + $1/contract on options trading PLUS a fee of like $50 if you get assigned. IB you end up paying like $2-$3 per trade including options.

I had a dream last night with a PLTR reference. I was at a friends house and there was a box of cookies with the PLTR logo all over it, and I said “big brother cookies!” in the dream. Wow I am such an autist.

So I heard that mortgage lenders are having people apply multiple times after a month because banks are approving loans in incrementally larger amounts based on the same income and reserves. e.g. Apply and get approved for $500k and a month later apply again and get $550k instead and going on.   
This would lead to new owners quickly going under and failing to make payments right?  
Anyone know if this is right?  
Wouldn't this lead to banks / realtors, and etc. going tits up in like 6 months from now?
Well you’d think the CEO of the largest equity based exchange in the world comprised of 30 trillion dollars would be worth at least a billion lol.

I understand that it's legit, it just seems like arbitrary method to give lower level employees (like me) a cash bonus. I think it might have been a 3 or 5 year vestment, so they could have been using at a retention tool.
Did the same thing with SWN
The problem is they look at -80% stocks and think they're cheap and look at stocks that are at all time highs and think they're expensive. There's a deep psychological barrier for many investors when it comes to buying at the highs. 


They're convinced it's going to crash and never go back up the moment they buy it... The problem is great stocks are usually always at all time highs, and for good reason.


Apple has had something like 1000+ new all time highs in the last 20 years.

Up around 5.5% this week, but god damn it seemed so boring as fuck. Wish I could finally get on something that really pops.

Enjoy your youth.  Don’t just live for your retirement years
A lot of them get caught up in "value" investing... IE buying stocks that are still lower than their 2008 prices thinking they're getting a bargain. 

"Oh look guys, I found a stock that's still lower than it was in 2008! Such a bargain it's been overlooked... I'm gunna scoop this stonk up before it goes back to all time highs".

Thinking of getting in on some XYL leaps on Monday. Company strong like bull.
It’s not free money as shares bc how finance works is: the moment the stock trades ex-dividend, it reduces the share price by the same amount as the dividend  (because cash from the balance sheet - which factors into equity value and market cap - is reduced by the dividend). But bases on behavioral economics, stocks tend to recover that dividend drop in a short time. 

You are right though - by holding calls, this is now both an opportunity cost and an actual cost against your calls
I personally think it’s not too late. Once it merged with Canoo I can see it go to $30 just because of meme potential. And ppl will say “how did miss the CNOO ipo?” lol. No guarantees though of course.

The ONLY chance of weed getting even decriminalized is *IF* the Dems take the Senate, and even if that happens it may give weed stocks a little bit of a bump for a month or two, but it would be bad for both the stock market and the weed market on a whole. Two words, regulation, and taxation. The rules to be able to sell would be way worse, and dont get me started on the tax. So to give some context, I drove through Illinois this summer, and they wanted $190 for 150mg (about two or three doses for me) of edibles. To contrast that, Oregon charges about $18 for the same amount. Now imagine if the federal government starts sticking their fingers in that pie. I could be completely wrong but I dont see it as a good thing.

No, this encourages begging at intersections. If nobody gave them money, they wouldn't be at the said intersections.

To make matters worse, they allow the homeless to do this more so in the poor part of town vs the nice parts. I don't think this is because the poor are more likely to give money to the poor.

As a long term stockholder, I'll take Elon over Burry on this one. I'll also add the FSD is a software that is quickly evolving to meet it's end goal and NOT vaporware, which insinuates it doesn't exist.

The worst thing to do is to try to get a job that uses your degree.
I'm prepared to be downvoted to Oblivion for saying this but, maybe the lesson here is be happy with a little and pay your damn taxes.
I take a 1 hour lunch break and I watch netflix while doing my work. I also take 15-20 minute breaks throughout the day to play video games. I still get all my work done but now I'm much happier and stress-free.
My man you getting me pumped up!!!
The beginning of September, Tesla had a 5 Billion Stock offering and got news they were not getting into the S&P. The stock dropped from $500 to $308 (AH for like 1 second) over a couple weeks, however if you didn't sell that day it rebounded to $370ish, the next week $400 became support.

Morale of the story, Shorting Tesla you have at max a few days to sell your puts before retard strength takes over. In this current market Tesla can go down, but it can't be kept down.

Basically, don't short it unless you believe 100% in your timing.
No options for a couple weeks so buy shares as soon as possible (usually trading starts around 11 AM approximately) before they pop too far

These companies want to have a good first day for the news cycle so they’ll underprice it for a pop
"Tech" can be both the future and overvalued. I'd say overall technology is the future, but the Internet might not be where the most growth comes from during the next 20 years.

With tech being already established as an industry and within a few months of being seriously regulated for the first time ever, it probably doesn't have have as much upcoming growth as other areas.

Dude, Oregon is the most oversaturated place when it comes to doing the pots. You can buy a gram of 78% THC shatter here for $14. Edibles for $6. I'm bearish on weed stonks too, it's all a bunch of hype and hopium. Especially a dogshit Canadian company like ACB. Oregon (aka the land of the sticky icky) has nothing to do with Aurora Cannabis
This ain’t it homie
Exactly. Gamble and lose that same $7000 14 times.
Buy a call, sell it at 100%. Then do it again. Just double yuh money and make it stack dawg.
If you don’t have a spac play next week you are doing this wrong

Ill cheer up i gotta get this Christmas spirit popping but i just hope people do what we have been advised to do because i cant even see gram dawg i love my gram
With tech, you're paying a future premium, but once we reach that future date, the future will look even better for the stock, so the valuations aren't really unsustainable until the R&D prospects start looking poor.
It's really really hard to offshore money now.  Many banks stopped accepting money from US citizens due to reporting requirements and fines due to noncompliance.

Like shell corporations, attorneys in ever-rarer tax havens, and still facing risk of massive civil fines and possible criminal charges.

December is the biggest month for auto deliveries.  In 2019 NIO increased 25% from Nov to Dec.  They would need to do that in 2020 to be at or exceed the high end of the guide. 

Of course the unknown is how much impact double shifts will have on production.  I am confident in management's ability to forecast and meet or exceed guidance.

Think I got banned by Reddit itself for calling someone something that rhymes with nag
It won't. Float is huge, and until that changes, shorts can keep the price pinned. Those hedge funds are much smarter and much more well funded that us retards. However, if enough smart money moves against the shorts, WSB can eke out a small win here and jerk themselves off for all eternity. Either way in my movie version of the events deepfuckingvalue will be played by fat Zac Efron
Ahh I forgot to include that, but yes that’s another reason why I’m playing
The trick is to only gamble the same amount you gambled before

Amazon has same day delivery and delivers Saturday in my city.
If you're comparing Airbnb to hotels then you don't get their business model.

Hotels are hemorrhaging cash right now. Selling off prime properties in Time Square, firing tons of people they spent years to train, and they have hundreds of hotels with giant lobbies, buffets, and room service that are COVID superspreading locations that no one wants to visit.

Meanwhile Airbnb is focused on privacy, your own kitchen, no shared spaces with other guests generally, etc. The number of people I know who have moved permanently into Airbnbs to work from home is insane.

Hence why Airbnb occupancy is at 80% of last year while hotels are 35-40%

Meanwhile there is huge pent up travel demand. No one I know wants to go to a hotel next year due to continued COVID risk so the debts are going to pile up further. You're braveif you want to go to a Hilton in March but most people definitely aren't rushing to do that. If you pay enough to get a really private experience for your anniversary then it might be different but a normal hotel room? No thanks.

Also you didn't mention that Airbnb is a global travel brand operating in every country while the major hotel chains are regional due to their high cost of doing business.

So yeah if you ignore the fact that Airbnb doesn't have to pay for hotels, doesn't have to hire tons of hotel workers, doesn't have to risk capital on locations that might be unprofitable, etc. then you miss the fact that their margins are way better and they have drastically reduced capital needs. Hence the return on equity is way higher. They have also have a MUCH higher growth rate which is what companies are largely valued on...

So yeah never compare Airbnb to a hotel again. Your best comparison would have been Expedia or Booking but they have many of their own issues.
Why is this green, is it a new update or something?
I know everyone hates Kroger, but isn’t it like super undervalued? Revenue and earnings add up to way more than market cap. Maybe there is an underlying thing I’m missing?

Watching CHWY it’s a good one short term but not past March
It’s just everyone doesn’t need to lose their shit when you don’t have a perfectly formed comment.  Clearly I was referring to people that are members of this sub are not here because they are trying to invest in the bond market.  And yea I clearly do understand that the bond market has plenty of utility in an overall market strategy.  

But overall Santellis expertise is so incredibly specific that it doesn’t apply to a lot of things and in my opinion he should just stay in his lane.  Like yea it’s great to have a guy who just works on transmissions, it’s really really important.  But I’m looking more for the advice of someone who can work on the whole car.  

I felt I cleared it up in like the first reply to my comment but no people gotta dig it and score their points and at the end of the day I don’t even understand what they are upset about.  Because I attacked their precious bond market by stating that stocks have more utility for members of this sub?
Shit, I wasted my money then
I know was just saying that both sides have approved it ... which they should.
I dunno prolly Cresco Labs and Trulieve
I love my countries tax laws. 20% is max rate regardless of what you make and you dont have to pay a cent before you actually use the money on anything other then securities.

If there's one thing I've learned in all my years trading, all the hundreds of thousands of dollars both up and down, all the lambos bought and then repossessed, it's this: Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever.

(Legitmately asking) is the reason the short interest is over 100% because there are a lot of puts?

Pls halp
Yah man, seems like a logical gamble.  Which tickers are you considering?
IMO. It def will. My charting just tells me that it has more short terms downside. I can def tell you, if it nears 33-30 that will be the time to buy IMO. The big test will be the 38-40 pivot area next week. I think it will bounce and the head to strong downtrend resistance where will have a final test before 33-30 IMO. If it fails to breakout and bears win then IMO it will head to 35-33-30 area.  Next week is going to be interesting for sure.
At least you were bold enough to take a risk, maybe it wasn't the right level of risk but you did something. I am more timid than I should be which keeps my losses down but more often it keeps me from pulling tendies.

You're not out.

Khan Academy is a great resource to learn just about anything academia related, finance included. There's also several YouTube accounts that are free of click bait, and are also actually free. projectoption, InTheMoney, and Invest42morrow are some accounts that I'm subscribed to. The most important thing is to not spend money for information that is readily available. Don't pay for someone's plays or discord chat, dont pay for some Joe Schmoe "portfolio guru" you found on a Google search. Educate yourself for free.

Yes, you definitely want to be paying taxes on it now unless you plan on making less when you turn 60. You’ll probably be in a higher tax bracket
ive been wondering this myself actually
🙏🏻🤞🏻
Sounds complicated
Nah man it's a stock chart
I think so. I think my 1/15 55c I had rolled over is  fucked. I’m glad I rolled it over when I did though woulda lost ALLL my gains. Now I only lost 79%


*Edit: wooo only 79% loss not 85%

I am making a joke that Accenture resources at my firm is supposed to actually do work and implement the solution their own team strategised, but they never do. They continue to extend their time needed to complete their original scope of work. 

I am saying Accenture is a shitty scam company that lies and cheats. The only reason they’re selected is because they have a cushy relationship with leadership.

Bingo. It is valued like they already delivered all three and are the marketleaders in all three. They haven't delivered and are the market leaders in 0 of the 3. Sure they sell more EVs than anyone but that is because all they sell are EVs. Also creating EV batteries and "recycling" them(notice air quotes because you can't effectively) are really bad for the environment. EVs with batteries are going to look like we look at Atari 2600s compared to consoles today. New tech is closer than people think, so even leading in the battery space won't be the future.
well yea if you do get to the target and your calls are itm, you'll have gained far more than your friend since they will increase in value a lot more till then. but yea,, if

That's exactly it. I've read many people being concerned about this happening or speculating on it, but have not seen a single post of someone saying it happened to them (there was an old post from 2016 about someone making 500K on MJ stocks, but that's about it).
Rich people do.
No, many people plan on maxing out the 0% long term cap gains tax bracket in retirement, so roth doesn't mean much

Ancedotal story: my college girlfriend was the woman I was going to marry, no doubt in my heart. We had to do the long distance thing for six months and she dumped me the day she moved back to town.

I was devastated to put it mildly.

I took that angst and anger, listened to a lot of "Forget You" by Cee Lo and "Someone I Used to Know" and started a small business (two years later but I made the decision when she dumped me). I didn't really pay myself a real wage until last year, then COVID hit and I'm here.

I guess my point is you'll fucking show her but don't expect it today. Not having it today isn't the WSB way but patience is how you get there.

Edit: Forget You is the only song with a better radio edit than the original.
Did you move all the funds over. I’m thinking of just moving 25 percent to it and leaving the rest in a fund that’s done really well for me that’s closed to outside investors and focuses on mid cap growth
The only thing I understood was buy Tesla calls.
Need a TL;DR: otherwise I’m just buying PLTR

you fucked up with the tom. but yes, a nice plain bagel with some cream cheese and bacon is wonderful.
Great minds think alike. Was thinking a very similar thing. I may just let the cash sit there for a month or so until the inauguration and see if I get a little dip.

But I’m also keeping a ton in one of the funds I’m in that’s been closer for like a decade and gives good returns
I had a buddy drive 10 hours round trip for one. I just gave a GameStop manager I know a few hundred bucks cash to call me when one came in.
Haha yeah, was 2 depressing years for my finances.
Had to tap out, so maybe I'll get to make a gains post in the future!

I recently switched my401k to a PCRA.  My company does not allow any options (and margin is disallowed) but I'm happy to have it none the less.  Will let me play the market tax free.
Thankyou!
What's the plan now?
So should I really switch my 401k to a ROTH 401k right? I’m 23. 

Tax now better than tax later?
Long puts would do the trick without margin risk.

Ahh I see man, so OTM is inherently more risky than near ITM calls/puts to begin with and to top it off you won't see gains until that unlikely target is pretty close. O lawd lessons learned. Thinking I was big brain buying 100+ contracts, lmao

My general assumption is that there's just a 0.3% 401k fee since the 0.32 fund is a Fidelity 500 index, and the Vanguard Target Date fund is also ~0.3% higher than what I can buy directly through them. Kinda sucks but still worth getting my 4% match.

After posting I realized you can't time the top and you might become part of the short. But the Volkswagen short pushed the stock up from 200€ to 1000€.

Problem with Airbnb is that it's valuation is already at Marriott levels, with the risk of further regulation cutting into margins, as well as post CoVid travel booking patterns flowing back to traditional hotels.  

We were going to rent for our Anniversary trip in March, but would much rather stay at a high end hotel (Hilton Diamond, Marriott Gold).  Since most likely we will be vaccinated (healthcare , wife is frontline) we aren't as worried about common area contamination
Not if you're rich then it's just death.
Yes, some people did make a lot of money in Feb-March. Not that many but yes. People who pay for them are those who think the stock will recover and sell them.

I’m in the 1/2021 calls and have shares since the stock was at $12 pre battery day. I am believe that more global stimulus and inflation will lead to higher iron and nickel ore prices (along with upside for EV) - all big upside for Vale

The ONLY downside of your options is Vale pays a large amount of dividends every year (5-6% yield), which you don’t receive as an option holder. So if you assume in 2021 that Vale pays a total div of $1 per share, that $1 gets knocked off stock price when they go ex-dividend

A fund for wide spread investor fraud.
you should follow follow your friend...58c is a, um, pretty optimistic target you got there
I rolled over one of my 401ks into a Fidelity IRA and my the same thing for my wife. I've been actively managing them and having better success then any of the funds that were available before in the 401ks.

We do have other tax deferred accounts that follow more conservative strategies. I don't YOLO our entire retirements. 

But you need to gauge your personal risk tolerance; this year I am of the mindset that there are signficant opportunity costs in passively investing.
Nice, yeah ours is with Schwab and they are not charging any to self-direct. Options are not allowed on ours but we can buy any ETF/STOCK.

Not gonna mess around too much with the 401k but it would be nice to put some cash with cathie or the VOO. The target funds just don’t really give any comparable turns to what everything else has done. I’m fine with the volatility though.
My thoughts is this is not r/investing. I don't see a Yolo play loss or gains. Therefore I say Ban
Yeah you are

Going through here and reading about the GME short squeeze is fucking hilarious and I don’t get tired of it. I’m not discrediting it at all, it is good DD for the most part, but the idea of hedge funds and massive shorters just getting fucked by a bunch of WSB kids cracks me the fuck up. I don’t have a position but I hope it happens for you all lmao

In my eyes I guess I see a range of Tesla not developing self driving first but creates the best fully electric car on the market (est price 3200-3600 a share pre split) to Tesla developing both first (est price the fucking moon who knows). It would be a revolution akin the industrial or Information Age. This is all under the notion ofc that in the next decade electric driving will be heavily subsidized and supported by gov’s to the point that buying any gas or even hybrid car would be the viewed with the same extravagance and wastefulness as buying a hummer. 

And if that notions false well nothing would really matter anyway. We would be far to concerned about habitable areas becoming inhabitable and the resulting mass exodus’s that occur to care for stocks or money or life as we know it now.
I hope so. I’m so ready to sell
for your example: Pic was trading at 13-14 before the whole spac got drag down by cramer and traded at 10-11 for a month or two. Then nio hype happen and the annoucement of XL grid + people anticipating the merger date is coming soon, which lead to rally.
Did you spam something?

You must be doing big ticket jobs to be clearing $100/hour. I guarantee you are in the top echelon of time setters at that rate. All of the time work I have contracted is usually installed at $4ish per foot plus materials, and that is split between two or three guys plus the boss man.

Also, the kick she did was dumb.. Start the half with a squib?

Anyways, Im sure I'd be called a sexist and other things by most of Reddit for having this opinion
Yeah check my post below, it’s a really interesting company I could see it stabilizing in the high 20s before merger then who knows from there. You gotta understand it mooned 70% with not a soul talking about it. Not just here but anywhere , I put some people into it after I got banned

Do you not throw homeless people money occasionally? 

Now as far as being on WSB, if you can't throw $40 for a play just to see then you may be in the wrong place. Win some lose some but keep playing the game. Now I'm not a retard level of Yoloing the value of my house on a meme stock so I won't end up in the poor house.

On top of that I have never bet an option that wasn't with stock gains anyway.

I'll make sure to throw a few twenties to someone in need today on your behalf and won't feel bad about that either.
Shhh
You should look into running theta strategies in Indian markets. Basically automatic portfolio margin with their equity futures
We just got something similar with our new one and I was considering the same thing. They charge 0.3% to self-direct, but the lowest cost fund they have is 0.32% so I don't see much downside.

What I was really wondering is if I could write covered calls, but I somehow doubt that's allowed.

Implied NIO December deliveries are 6,154 to 6,654.  NIO is always conservative with guide, could be higher.  Triple digit Dec YoY growth is almost guaranteed.

There will be a fuck you one two punch in the first week of January (deliveries then NIO day).  Maybe not yet with all the volatility, but this will get priced in in the run up.
Correct. Some even have products! Oh jeez oh man how awful.
I should've gotten the 17, but oddly there were no others available at the time. Could pick up more, but SPAC train making me fomo a bit.
I'm pretty retarded. My friend bought near ITM calls for SNAP and he is up 70%. My line of thought was, of course its going to reach that and go past it so I bought far OTM. I'm only up a little bit while he's up 70%. I thought I would be the big winner cause I bought a shitload of contracts for cheap... I'm thinking if I just followed him, I could have sold and bought additional contracts with the gains thus making more money. I guess OTM doesn't pay off until its really close to target? Got 58C 12/24 for when it was at 43.xx.

We are not the only once, hence the stock is up to >16, after the low point in summer, despite heavy resitance from shortsellers.
A lot of big players haven't entered yet since GME bonds still have a junk rating, and they aren't allowed to enter such companies. Rating will stay junk until GME turns profitable again, which is why people looking for Q4 2020.

% of people willing to take the vaccine has been rising. Experts are also saying if and when it starts to roll out under the Trump administration at all the number of republicans willing to take it will shoot up as a way to show support.
Everything that goes up eventually comes down. Has nothing to do with being mentioned on WSB.
You might know that sentiment on Nio generally is still mega bullish. What do you think about that? Is it one of the cases where you should be fearful when other’s are greedy? I just ask because I see so many ppl thinking this will go back to 50+

Yo even with the vaccines coming out i still think we are going to have a lot of trouble  getting past covid. There are people that won’t even mask up cause they are privileged fucks who think their rights are being infringed upon. How will you get anti maskers and anti vaxxers to take any vaccine? This thought just made me sad.

**[Turbo warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo warrant)**

A turbo warrant (or callable bull/bear contract) is a kind of stock option. Specifically, it is a barrier option of the down and out type. It is similar to a vanilla contract, but with two additional features: It has a low vega, meaning that the option price is much less affected by the implied volatility of the stock market, and it is highly geared due to the possibility of knockout. This type of products is actively traded among investors in Europe and Hong Kong, which is partially due to the fact that it can cater to individual investors' behavioral biases (like lottery preferences).

Reminds me of a that episode of Rocket Power where purple hair girl was obsessed with the handicapped snowboarder with a prosthetic leg. She said "whoa, I bet she wants to be the best handicapped snowboarder ever" and squid was like "I think she wants to be the best snowboarder ever.. regardless of handicap."

I have to imagine that the female kicker wouldn't want a participation award, but rather would want an award for an actual achievement. Anything else seems inadvertently sexist..

Shorts have borrowed more shares than there are available. Us retail investors need to buy up shares and/or LONG dated calls, shorts will eventually  need to close out their positions.
Option liquidity is fine on popular tickers, definitely not like shares but good enough. On unpopular tickers and especially way OTM strikes, the bid ask spread is going to be large.

Glad to hear you take it seriously
people preparing for a "short squeeze" which is basically like a trap for people shorting the stock which means borrowing the stock to resell and make money. However, if stock price like goes up they're badicslly screwed and have to borrow more shares to cover their short positions driving up the stock price even higher

"Finally, it turns out that the Prometheus has sustained too much hull damage to make the trip to Atlantis. The crew plans to return to Earth to make repairs. As this discussion concludes, another alarm sounds: Vala has escaped. She rings to the Al'kesh and escapes into hyperspace." 

So its stock price is either going to hyperspace or its going to return to earth for repairs in order to fly again. That's my analysis. 

Way to go on your DD tho. I scored 2 tesla calls after someone's DD that tesla tequilas are $250 each and the limit is two bottles. Strike 460 and sold for like 10k total then put that money into PLTR $40 12/04 calls. Lmfao.

Those people are wage cuck smooth brains
Couple of thoughts:
1: Agree that it has room/will likely go up. $5 may be a stretch, IMO
2: There are ~13 billion shares outstanding AND Ave 10-day volume is 1.5 mil shares > 0.01% of all shares.L - this stock is thinly traded and not likely to have large swings any time soon.
4: The options market is highly illiquid and undertraded - the biggest open interest is 1500 $5c contracts expiring in May, and the Bid/Ask gap is 50% of the ask. You are almost guaranteed to lose money when you cross that gap twice (once to buy, once to sell).

Interesting proposition, maybe worth throwing some dollars at, but definitely not a YOLO candidate.

BORIng is GOOD LOLZ 

Fckinhr boomers
I may hold off for a bit longer, but it's always good to get into the meme stocks after the pump and return to reality. Usually there's some merit to the pump but it's too much too fast.

Probably go shares for NIO if it can dip below $40, Xpeng $45. The price action is too 'flavor of the week' to justify the premiums on options and trying to guess when all the EV/peripherals run up. I believe in the potential of the companies. Don't trust the buying patterns enough to pay up for options right now. Would rather be on the selling side of the contract.
Actively managed portfolio bad lmao
Be careful!
We ride together, we die together, bad boys for life 🤜🤛

Become an analyst.  My buddy is kinda well known in the biotech investing world. All he does is go around the country and stay at 5 star hotels while execs at biotech companies like pfizer all the way down to smaller biotechs wine and dine him with $1500 dinners while sucking his D so that he writes good reports for the stock.  I'm pretty sure he must make like $500k+ to 1 million per year for this fake job.  Working hard is for suckers.  The elite make money going to fancy diners.
Most people don’t understand economics, trading, or politics. On top of that they’re just extremely jealous that they aren’t the ones able to do this.

For example: While over 50% of Americans are invested into the stock market, the vast majority of those are just people with 401ks/retirement accounts that don’t touch them. I believe the number of people who actually have individual stocks/options/calls/puts is more around 15% or lower.

Next time you’re at work or school as people just even basic questions on how stocks work and be amazed at the answers.
Why JKS vs say.. SPWR or any other solar? Aren't they the most overvalued? (also chinese.. with whats been going on..)
what’s the play? Weekly puts print or further out
You're going to spam the same topic, every hour on the hour?

I'm staying away from this shit purely because of endless pumping.
K dude
Having faith in your country is good but realizing the potential of others in a realistic outlook is important too. China is doing very well and there’s money to be made by all

No dude. Thats actually pretty good. They will blow up. Tag it. Then give me 1k when u become uber rich and retarded
low volume slow holiday drift, lets keep it that way
Only if the underlying doesn't run away from you. I tried this strategy with oil and gas over the summer, but they dropped about 15% and the yields were extremely minimal. 

I did have success wheeling TQQQ in September.
If you are not taking profits after these questionable SPACs have their initial run then you deserve to get burn. My strategy has been to take out my initial investment and let the rest run
A tiny loss. The fact that they barely made a loss when everything is closed is incredible. WD will never be this cheap again

Nvax news is a long ways away. At least another month or two. I think they just started phase 3?

Nothing you wrote here addresses my question of your original statement.
I'll short it after earnings if I see a downtrend. I like predictability and don't mind joining in after the party is underway.

AQB got some legs still. I hope
Congrats!  Take out $85k, put it in savings...and continue to play at the casino with $10k.   Do it again
Not old news, carefully worded forward guidance. Karp already had the Q3 earnings report numbers and guidance figured out. Q4 will be very pleasing now that they work from Denver and DL costs and other various moving expenses are settled.

I bet a lot of their older contracts are hitting phase 2 and 3 monetizing model stages.
No, I just think fuck China

Banking on covered calls until shares recover.
But not really. They would have made that money regardless of their trade with you. It’s from the appreciation of their stock.

The only money they are making off you is the short interest.
So wtf, calls on what based on this? All I see is poor people arguing about masks and no positions. Fact: there is no covid on 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ships
Or maybe they can, and have more faith in the country.
There are too many conservative Democrats to actually have an appetite for anti-trust action. This is wild speculation.
Idk if u should be off their product, off their hype maybe

So you’re just a WSB nihilist/troll that enjoys seeing stocks crash and people lose money? Kind of fucked up I don’t wish bad things on people I want us all to succeed
Money supply (M1) is up around 60% from 1 year ago. And yes it is crazy. 

Real inflation is much lower currently, but it will catch up eventually as we move out of the recession. It may take a few years or a few months, I am not sure. But the market seems to be pricing it in now.
You shouldnt feel bad for being one of the smart retards that buy stocks when everyone else is stacking up fking toilettepaper or guns ffs , ppl are fking dumb
Why I hate euopoors always waiting for Americans to pump the market. Get some real gdp noobs China is beating yAll

They are all being cocky about about not gambling in Nio. Those fucks told me I was going to lose it all by buying shares at 9$. Fuck those guys, this dude got plenty of time.
I believe 6 months or more
I can't read all the shit you typed. However I looked at their chart, revenue and profits which were all declining year after year, pre-covid.

This is a pass unless they came out with a revolutionary product or got into the EV space?
just 1?

> For some mysterious reason, the writers (who are failed bankers themselves) thought that a shitload of sex, drugs, gay sex, and some more sex, could make up for their sorry excuse of a plot. Spoiler alert, it didn't.

Lena Dunham directed the first episode, so that should tell you all you need to know about it. 

The whole thing felt like the kind of agenda-driven garbage she'd write, so I would imagine the writers are her friends or in her clique, she'd be the last person you'd choose to direct a good show about a trading desk. 

Her episode was basically bashing financial institutions, claiming they literally work their interns to death. From there the show branched out into sexual power dynamics and a lot of other mundane "intern life drama" stuff that filled in 75% of the show because they couldn't make trading interesting.

I think they probably split, which sounds stupid, but there simply isn't a unified Republican strategy now with all the Biden tensions, so Perdue is having to sit in his own shit without any help, while Loeffler is sort of scoring own goals on her offensive.

Chances are one of them is doing it wrong.
Good question. I’ll admit, I’m not sure the criteria     for eligibility.  I focused on ones that were more clearly hardship cases, though they are fewer and further between.

Every day we get closer to Dec 26th without a crash means there wont be one until Jan 5th.

Oddly enough a lot of funds are down on the year still so they are gonna buy up the winners and there will be a santa rally.

I did think the reopening trade was due for one more steep correction before Christmas but I dont think we have enough time.
Biden’s president now time for China to go up to their actual values. Amazon at 3.5k and Tesla at 600 but people wanna talk shit about JD at 90 baba at 270 and NIO at 42...This is why I hate Americans sometimes they are completely out of touch and can’t see outside of nationalistic viewpoints
Yeah, but if you look at the government shutdown history, SPY has only went down 2 times during government shutdowns. 8/10 times it’s went up.

Nope. That was all you.

APHA's Sweetwater acquisition is precisely why I bought them over other cannabis stocks. Some breweries in California are doing collaborative weed beers, but it's a fledgling market segment. Wait until they start distributing across all of Canada, as well as pushing Sweetwater's existing product line into the other 23 states it's not in yet.

That, and the fact that the Canadian companies have less restrictions and a headstart since their 2019 legalization.

I don’t do margin trading but I’m pretty sure you don’t accrue interest on margin. And I believe when people do margin trading they usually have the cash in their bank account to back it up.

Same. I’m a meteorologist. 2020 hurricane season most active on record. Fun year especially with the wild backloading hurricane season with the Greek storms. Jesus. Wonder how they are gonna go about retiring those names.

Still think 2005 was more crazier though.
Imo, and this has sorta happened with every SPAC, we're going to see a mild dip after it reaches a short ATH. A merger date is comparable to a stock split in the sense that....nothing's different. Fundamentally nothing has changed except for a confirmation of a date and ticker name.

Most big money will use this opportunity to pull out their customers cash and let the winnings ride.

I'm hoping it stays around 20$ til the 18th...but with it having so many catalysts so close B2B reveal and the December 21st vote....it may shoot higher than expected.

Expect a major correction this thing went beast mode. It’ll come back to 30 after the month though I’m sure maybe 2. Puts on this thing right now are likely free money however

Took me a while and soul searching to accept this but it is ultimately because as we get older we have less and less milestones in life. (graduation, relationship, first job, first car, promotion, marriage, kids etc etc). Lot of people think that they're "plateauing" because they're not experiencing anything new so they don't feel growth. This is a false narrative that we give to ourselves and is what I found out made me unhappy at times. In the end, you just gotta find what you like to do, be it gaming, gambling/trading, teaching, etc and just.. enjoy life

Bro imo it’s all hype, look into what they have written about their product. They mention ml/ai 50 times in filing but their main product is to provide a platform which they basically mention once. Their ai/ml isn’t all that either, they say they have the ability to scale but near term this can be done my a lot of other companies too. Looking at their ai/ml capabilities it’s not anything too special, most companies of similar stature can easily replicate what they have and as a tech company they are bleeding money. Most people who use seibel’s product including the c3.ai platform won’t have tm good to say abt it. They are great at marketing tho, product not sm.
TLDR: boomer management, great at marketing, product not sm, gonna go up only bc hype.
he doesn't.....look retarded but I'll take your word for it.
You will get it back. 

Smart to recognize you can afford to lose that money because your actual real job is what brings in $$$. Just got to make sure you don't neglect your job and company versus trading. 

Also, my suggestion is to stay away from options etc. You can easily bring it back with shares and commons. 

My suggestion is to park a bunch of money into SPACs. Put like 150k into 4 various ones you like and just wait for announcement. Should be good for 30%+ pops and then move onto the next one.
Someone mad their puts didn’t print? Hope you sell for -50 to -70% before next week when it goes to -100%

This guy is a literal fucking retard 🌈🐻

He has opened at least two funds which had to close cause they did so poorly.

He predicted DOW 40,000 in 2000 just before the dot com bubble burst.

He called Dow 3,000 in 2014 during the historic bull market.

And he said the Dow would fall 17,000 points after Trump got elected.

This asshole is literally too stupid to post on a retard sub like wsb so why the fuck is anyone writing articles about what he thinks?
This is the way.

There's 100 IPO's from this year in spac, cloud and ev that're currently hoovering around 50b cap, who have never made a cent of profit. Not 50b spac but you get my point.
Not gonna invest in cannabis any time soon. Bubble already burst on the 2018 farm bill and CBD crap. It's not going to be like TSLA which was a first of its kind to be publicly traded. It's a market full of dime-a-dozen companies ran by pot heads; I had an inside look at a couple cannabis companies ins 2019 and let's just say I would have gone all in on put LEAPs if it weren't illegal and would have made bank. From the limited contact I still have with those companies, nothing has changed. I look at the balance sheets every quarter and chuckle to myself. 

Once corporate consolidation starts taking place and the winners start becoming more evident I might add cannabis to my retirement portfolio in small amounts.
rofl this is a lie. Most plumbers won't even bother coming to your house for $95. Time and gas money isn't worth it.
Shhhhh don't question the narrative
Also $ARRY. Was a meme at $2.40 a share and Pfizer bought it for $48 a share. Beat ROI I’ve ever had. Wish I had more shares
BABA - Pretty solid, you got it at a discount and it has great fundamentals, deregulation and Chinese government are headwinds, but I'd say pretty minor, overall a good pick.

BA - Too many headwinds. Shitty economy, airlines not buying new planes. A single crash, even one that isn't there fault, will result in a huge nosedive. For me that's a lot of risk for stock that's only going to give you 50% upside over the next few years.

TSLA - I'm of the opinion that this is pretty much TSLA's top. I think its a great company but it's value has increased 1000% in a year. Elon called it overvalued only a few months ago when it was $400 a share (now $600). Personally, I see little upside and an easy 30% downside over the next 12 months. Then again, smarter people then me have called TSLA a bubble and it still hasn't popped.
Bro there will be inflation but not 60% maybe like 3% at a max or I guess you’re exaggerating as a joke in which case my bad for being all serious

Yes, and how many hours per day and how many days do you work per week?

Share price has 0 to do with company value. Company a has a share price of $2000, company b has a share price of $20.

But company a only issued 100 shares, total value $2,000,000. Meanwhile company b issued 10,000,000 shares, total value $200,000,000. Look up market cap and you'll see what I mean.

Hello fellow PLTR bagholder.
This is the best
That’s a strange response to good advice. If you own the shares, even if your broker is RH or whoever, you’re perfectly within your rights to use any other broker and exchange a swap. And in actual fact, that might be tax free.
What’s the word on modern day stock brokers? Worth it trying to get into the field/working for a firm? Anyone currently in the field of finance? Serious answers only and if so what do you do for a living? Just a young Bull trying to make something of myself
What do you trade with in Canada? Currently studying there
Oh btw guys new guidances for NIO and Xpeng show them doubling their car sales from the already expected double. They could both be doing half a million cars next year each if they maintain their current moving average increase. 150,000 cars for NIO is a minimum in 2021
Still down. And even with the greatest bull run on record you aren’t recovered from it.

Not necessarily. Many of his recommendations recently led to price explosions. For example, with Luminar (LAZR). He made them known to older traders.

There’s a whole bunch of EV sector stocks that keep climbing but have no viable products on the market (aka revenue) and metric fucktons of debt. And the hype = price part is 100% spot on. It’s just like the weed stock pump from a couple years ago. S0LO is the ACB of EV’s.

As opposed to losing?

No, that's not how any of this works. 

We've all lost too many and too much to feel guilt over not losing more.
People who missed the boat on tesla are jumping ship to other EV stocks. Can't blame them when I could of been a millionaire earlier this year is I went all in on OTM leap calls. 

However when tesla is going to crash/correct itself all of those stocks are going to crash even harder. 

For now, you either surf on the wave or avoid it. Don't try to block the wave or else you'll get crushed. 

Buying LEAP puts or spaced short term puts for a big correction might be your best move if you're bearish. Avoid shorting the stock without covering it with calls.
Send me all your money and I will let you know
Despite the common sentiment, I don’t think c3.ai is what it is being hyped up to be. Seibel is not the best when it comes to management and unlike palantir this company seems more advertising based more so than product based. People who have used c3.ai don’t have too much positive to say about it and looking at what they have written about their machine learning/ai so far it basic rudimentary stuff that a lot of other companies can replicate. You can argue that they have the ability to scale, but so do other companies. In fact its main focus is to provide a platform rather than provide great ai/ml capabilities. As a tech company it should not be bleeding as much as it does.

TLDR: company is great at marketing, product no so much
Possibly, but I'm pretty sure that those people are the vast minority in the markets. And nobody is telling them that gambling their benefits with an instrument that they know absolutely nothing about is in any way a reasonable choice.

Understatement of the year. It's the worst show I've ever seen in the history of tv shows, maybe ever.

It's a Suits knockoff set on the Sales desk of a bank, where Mike Ross isn't interesting enough so they choose to throw into the mix a handful of dysfunctional two-dimensional characters with boring storylines.

For some mysterious reason, the writers (who are failed bankers themselves) thought that a shitload of sex, drugs, gay sex, and some more sex, could make up for their sorry excuse of a plot. Spoiler alert, it didn't.

If you haven't seen the show, don't bother. Read the "plot" online and open PornHub, you'll get a far superior experience in a fraction of the time.

A licensed plumber can cost that much, but overhead isn't cheap and yes taxes are paid.  I know this from experience.  For a plumber to make six figures requires a tremendous amount of work and usually involves a lot of industrial plumbing on top of residential.

It may be a while or it may never actually happen. Joe biden plans to push his clean energy bill which is estimated to create ~10-12 million new high gross paying jobs. This is the prospect that the market is look forward too, as the market is always looking 5-10 years ahead. 

More jobs = more money = market stays pumped. 

Also Joe biden will probably try to compromise to sign a massive relief bill for the economy and american people. More checks = market may stay pumped. 

All in all, this would actually level out the playing field, allowing the ev stocks to catch up to their pumped valuation.
I think it’s more of the gains poor boy.

They say most important about trading is leaving your emotions behind and just seeing it as numbers but god damn am I bad at following rules
Warrant wide spread often are because the warrant can be exercised only after a certain amount of time and so if prices spike up months or weeks before warrants are exercisable they trade much lower cause price will probably go back to normal values and so the warrants could become worthless
Ugh. Please don’t do this. If you really need to just find a broker for your IRAs that will

This is how Monday is gonna work. 

Futures are gonna open Sunday night red as fuck without stimulus, they are gonna see if the dip gets bought up, if the dips gets bought up, they will use “stimulus momentum going well. 

If futures are around -0.5% to -0.70% they will use optimistic about a deal. 

If we are -0.8% to -1%, “ a deal is very likely soon”.

If we are -1.5 to -3%. Deal is imminent and Kudlow will be on CNBC. 

If we are -3 to -5%, the stimulus package they will say is ready to be signed and just waiting for confirmation. Kudlow, Mnunchin, and Pelosi will be on CNBC.

These all will bring futures to a green open.

If you’re really into it, take it seriously and treat it like a job. It is hard to be disciplined but if you are you’ll do really well.

First I heard.
The only reasonable move is selling your SPY.
if u got assigned then your leap will act as collateral which able to cover the monthly call or u can manually sell your leap and buy the monthly call to close the position.

this strategy is much more complicated than normal CC, u need to do some brain work and calculation.

if u wish to use this strategy , there are many tutorial video on youtube, try to understand before using it

I assume the IRS has the long-term cap gains taxes as a way to reduce volatility and encourage true investing into the growth of something as opposed to just trading it around. 

Example if the wash sale didn't exist. Let's assume you pay 10% in long term taxes and 20% in short term taxes:

I have already made $100 in 2020 only from other positions. I love company ABC and bought 1 share for  $100 on Oct 1. ABC fell to $50 by dec 29, and i sold it.  total yearly earnings are now $50. I pay my 20% tax which is $10. I buy ABC back on Jan 2  2021 for $52. I make no other trades on anything in 2021, so my taxbill is 0.

Now this time i hold until Jan 3 2022. and sell it at $102. i now get charged the long term rate on it, which is 10%. and pay $5 in taxes.

So over those 3 years, while the stock increased by $2, i saved $10 in taxes in 2020, and paid $5 in taxes in 2022. Essentially taking $5 from the IRS.

What's the exit strategy for **PLTR calls** exp 12/18 & 12/24 ? Don't want to wait too long for the price to increase cuz of time decay. Exit by Mon/Tue ( ideally if it touches 27 or higher ) ?

You aren't seeing the big picture.  You can get a job at Target, Amazon, the local school district, dentists office, whatever.  But there are jobs out there that will keep a roof over your head and keep you fed if you get laid off.  Yes, all of them are not great jobs, but you should definitely not kill yourself over panic about having enough money.
I saw it at 1.95 and decided that 2.30 was the right time to pull the trigger. 🤦‍♂️

Ah ok I knew it was something similar. Problem is, what happens if the short OTM exp ends up getting called away?

I.E., you buy AMZN leap for current price.
You sell a OTM call for next month.

OTM call ends up ITM. What happens to your leap?

Most of the big holders are also institutions. Only like 22MM shares are available in the float and 67MM shares have been shorted. They MUST cover at one point if the company is still healthy and no signs of bankruptcy. Huge upside potential with very limited downside risks.
Oh damn
Yep
That's a really bad idea, especially if you have as little income as you say. If your gamble fails not only did you lose all the loan money, you now have to dip into your savings/investments to pay it off and interest on personal loans tend to be pretty high.
Too low

It very well may continue to make investors money in the short term, especially until everyone that wants a new gen console has one. 

All I’m saying is they need to be finding new revenue sources outside of disc trade ins if they want to still be relevant when the next gen consoles after this cycle are released. 

The Microsoft deal is very interesting. I’m curious to see how much of a percentage they’re actually going to get there.
Not if you zero your accounts. Only withdrawals contribution room reset after the new year. If there’s no money to withdrawal, then you don’t get the contribution room back since you’ve already used up that room.

Can't even buy puts on this garbage.
There are gambling addicts who buy calls. In order for you to buy them, someone else has to sell them. So if you own the underlying stock, you can sell someone the option to buy the stock at some price. The buyer pays the seller a premium for this service. The premium is a pretty low risk way to grow your investments. That’s what they do at r/thetagang if you’re more interested. (It turns you 🏳️‍🌈 FYI)
Absolutely
This is pretty conservative you might be right, it’ll prolly be higher before NIO day then some people will take profits dropping it to around 60.
So should I just buy puts on these sons of bitches can’t sell covered calls brokerage doesn’t allow cash secured
He's probably a libtard
Yeah that back fired on them and they are fucked worse that PLTR this past week
🙋🏽‍♂️ Hear, hear sir
i think u got it wrong, should be

sell shorter exp OTM call
God. The amount of idiots pulling their money. I was telling people I work with that the crash was the best opportunity we'd ever get to invest.

I tried to get people to buy Tesla when it was around 400 bucks and said they'd double their money in about a year..

You don't think Waymo and Google collected useful data since 2008 when they started the project? Go look up how many cars they have already. They own them all and operate them all so they get full end to end data not just some dude showing off on the highway to his friend on the way to an Arby's. They also have much better hardware and sensors in them instead of just cameras, so they can collect data Tesla isn't even capable of collecting.

Buy Monday at open straight ITM for minimal IV or far OTM for maximum leverage. Tune in at 2:30 EST and depending on the size of the jump either sell/reduce before close (large jump) or Wednesday morning (mediocre jump).

Too high risk to bet the farm on it, but maybe like... the outhouse?

For ADT for instance, showing up on PL may have produced an 8% surge, or about 6% above the markets. NIO had its last big surge the day after getting attention on this program too. RedFin on the other hand didn't do shit.

yo, do you guys have any advice on getting a loan? I have cash invested in basic stuff like SPY, but I don't want to sell those investments to do my yolo's. I own my house but I want more money to trade with, only a small income right now cause I'm seasonal.

Worst case scenario if I fuck up I can pay back the loan in full anyways by selling my spy. Just want a $5000 loan, I read a post about a guy who got one and it changed his life etc and I missed a ton of trades not having enough cash this week.
That is where you buy a monthly call and then sell a leap right?
Most of the shorts are institutions so it's impossible to be SQUEEZED by retails, especially on a 1b company. You'll simply don't have the retard strength to do it.

It is VERY possible to sell during the dip and buy back at what you think is the bottom of the dip. They aren't going to kill the price only 50 cents then walk it back up. Use your fking brain.

If you truly believe in this company than you can call this free shares advice.
Lol this won’t affect true price though who cares about this
Yea. I do when I make a bet over 2k.. if its less than that, I just assume the money is gone and try to set a goal of 25% loss before Im out..

Im not a big baller and the small bets have really been where I've lucked out and made most of my money this year

Yeah my biggest loser last week
4000% on lottos 400% overall
outside of europe, which btw, companies like PSA, VW and citroen are rising up quick on the low cost EV front, tesla hasn't experienced much competition on the EV front.

Rivian, Ford Mach E are coming after the model Y and the cyber truck. Wouldn't be long until you get something coming after the S (technically the E-tron is here) and 3.

So maybe Tesla puts all those electric cars in their place and reminds everyone that they are unbeatable. Maybe their manufacturing can't keep up with the EV growth, and those guys with better manufacturing capabilities catch up. But i assume this is the most likely next major catalyst on Tesla
Can confirm they're not
Congrats and fuck you.... 🚀 🚀 🚀
Feels like it’s time doesn’t it?  
We have a President that may refuse to leave
He may try to do a hostile takeover of the government, I doubt it, but he’s crazy enough to try. 
We also have:
3000 deaths a day
225k new cases a day
Only 245k jobs added last month and everything is shutting down again
9M less jobs since the start of the pandemic

If there’s a single hint of bad news about the vaccine, a delay, a side effect, anything, I think the bottom falls out. 

We need a stimulus badly and the market seems to have one priced in so they better get it done.

You think Waymo put all that hardware in there for laughs? It is necessary. What Tesla is trying to do is not possible with the current hardware on the vehicles. There is a ceiling they will hit and it is well before FSD level 4. So if the bet is FSD level 4 then it is a fool's errand. Go find any researcher specialising in autonomous vehicles that doesn't have vested interest in any one company and they will say the same thing.

Karp valued the company before listing at around $20.  It could be argued with coronavirus contracts and exposure from going public, they are worth more now.
granted wouldn't the fact that his housing prediction was based on the fact that it was mathetmatically/economically unsustainable? 

Whereas with tesla valuations may be off (doesn't take a PhD to see that), but there is nothing unsustainable about these levels if people want to leave their money in it or keep pumping money into it.

I have kids, and while I wouldn’t call “not having kids” a gift, the limitations on male freedom is real. It’s also something a man doesn’t think much about when he is overcome with lust/love for his partner who likely wants kids one day. I love my kids and having them is wonderful, they are and always will be MY family, and family is all you really have in this world. That said, before deciding to have kids, I wish that I had considered the restrictions they place on my freedom as a man. I can’t say I would’ve decided against having them, but more thought on the choice to have them would’ve been good.
I think it's smart. Parents on Disney Plus are paying like 20 bucks for their stupid kids to watch a movie, people will 100% sign up for HBO Max to watch new releases and people that love going to the movies will still go to the movies. I'm gonna keep Max because of this when normally I'd hold onto it for a month and then cancel. I think it should be the new norm so I hope it works out

in addition to shorting shares, you can also write call options.

I mean yeah but don’t pretend it’s because of fundamentals when it’s really because of our retard strength as a group making a concerted effort.

Ach ya, wunderbar analysis.
>Also, the pandemic revealed that our bureaucracy generally has become sclerotic. You can blame the poor response to Covid on President Trump if you like, but it wasn’t all his fault. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention completely screwed up testing; HHS [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] was clueless about the nature of the challenge it faced. And state governments, not least New York, did abysmally, too. So, the question I would put to Biden’s team is, if that’s how we fail at the pandemic, what other disasters could we fail at on your watch? It isn’t likely that the next disaster will be another pandemic. History never works that way. So, there is a general problem at both the federal and state level. We have dysfunctional bureaucracies, and they don’t handle crises well. This isn’t peculiar to a pandemic. Look back over the past 20 years to [Hurricane] Katrina or even 9/11.

I don’t imagen a phara doctorate holder is on the phone with clients, as A coworker pisses all over the carpet because he would rather be working from home in a pandemic. I also don’t imagen your job is spent with 2/3 of the people you talk to telling you to kill yourself. 

Glad to hear your doing well, but call centres are not good employment if your already in a mentally shaky state

I'm a history graduate and making 28k is a dream job for me. Granted it's the UK, but still.
Yeah, I took a blood test recently and came back everything fine but low vit D. Yeah dude depression is crazy it’s not just being sad but like I actually feel it physically.
But like 99.9% of people don't retire by 32 let alone 52. A doctor is pretty much guaranteed a decent retirement by 45-50. I do agree that as a career choice it's pretty shit. Basically sleep deprived for 10+ years and in a shit ton of debt before you make money. Has got to be crazy stressful.
How do you know I’m a guy? 

Let’s close our eyes and hope the market increases. I’m fact, I’m going to take our a personal loan and buy call options. 

This market is insane.
Hey man, love that you do this. Can you please include PLTR and BABA in this next time? Thanks bruh.
Right. Look I don't care honestly. I made good money off NIO calls. But to assume just because it's the U.S. office that they aren't tied back to the CCP, that's wishful and almost certainly wrong.

Just keep heads up. Muddy will likely target over next few days more aggressively.

Edit: well I actually do care that my taxes are going to companies that don't need it or don't deserve it. But I don't care when it comes to trading. I'm not a "Chinese EV = bad" type
I'd imagine many pumped P L T R because of Thiel, well before it's inception.

And buy WELL BEFORE IT BECOMES A MEME. At the time of MEME, it's been already bastardized.
Look at the front page this entire week and see how many people lost on PLTR
Why is there generally higher volume an open interest for monthly calls vs weeklies?
Or, crazy talk here. Pay your taxes and contribute to the country you live in. I will see myself out.
Becoming a doctor is the biggest gamble of all time. $300k in loans in hopes you become one.

Being a doctor is literally the worst possible career choice. You don't make money until you are 32. I could have accumulated millions and retired by then.

Someone here said earlier that due to Covid deaths there would be more job openings, but my counter is: Under a normal market yes, but what about all the people that are unemployed and lost their jobs due to Covid.... now you gotta compete with them.
This is the stock that has almost singlehandedly gotten me out of Robinhood—i wanted to buy that post-earnings dip so bad, but it had rocketed up in the premarket exponentially the day after and I was like nahh.

You wake to the taste of stale vomit in your mouth. "I'm leaving. The kids are at your mother's. Until I can get us flights back to Florida."

You roll over to see your wife's silhouette in the bedroom doorway. The bright light behind her makes her seem invisible, like a void. It also makes your head start pounding like a drum. You open your mouth to speak, and she holds up her hand. "Don't say a thing." Then again, trembling. "Don't say a thing."

So you don't. And she leaves. And then you leave, via drink. Once again, you start the journey to the bottom of the bottle. As you open your Robinhood app, the jagged red line is fuzzy in your vision, but you can still see how long it is. And deep.

There's no coming back from this. The bright life behind you makes you feel invisible, like a void.

If you are buying Tesla. Which you can with 100 euro since the dollar is so shitty. You can buy the whole Tesla CFD. If it loses 25 dollar you lose 20 euro's.  


You also have margin call which automatically closes your positions if 50% of your portfolio has lost interest. Because it's required by EU law.  


Ameripoors just don't know better with pyramid schemes like options and getting fucked over with no laws.

>We are seeing the rollout of Chinese fintech solutions across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa through WePay and Alipay. Then, tack on the digital renminbi and look forward to a future where an Indonesian businessman goes to Singapore and pays for his taxi with Alipay and the transaction isn’t settled through Swift or the dollar but through digital renminbi. The pushback I get is that no one is going to trust the digital RMB—or, who wants the Chinese government to know how and where you spend your money? That’s a big roadblock, but if you told me 10 years ago people would put Alexa in their homes voluntarily….

All other studios with streaming services will have to do this or risk leaving money on the table. Mickey Rat will be the next to fall. No one was gonna go see Artemis Fowl anyway, the fact that the commercials for it keep playing as an advertisement for Disney Plus is embarrassing. No one is getting D+ for Artemis Fowl.

And even best case scenario, he’d be able to deduct $3k ($1.5k of single) of losses per calendar year (and carry over the rest). OP will likely be on the hook for a very hefty tax bill and _possibly_ an IRS fine for not paying taxes through the year in the 6 figure gains.

There’s also a general trend with SPACs over a 1-2 month cycle where people pile in and then one week they all crash together. 

Its weird I think big hedge funds like to buy units but then prob sell when it gets to like a 20% gain pre deal (going from like 10-12) which could cause the crashes. Who knows

Yeah that's pretty classic depression to sleep to avoid reality. I know it's hard but you can get through this man. Taking action, any action at all, is the best step. Anything you did more than the day before is a win even if it's just brushing your teeth. Small steps lead to big wins. Even just getting out of bed for 10 seconds and doing one single stretch then going back into bed is better than nothing. When you're depressed no task is too small. Also I'd highly recommend taking vitamin d supplements I was severely deficient cause I spend most of my time inside and fixing that helped as well. If you have anybody you can call to help you get through this please do and don't be embarrassed. I wish I could help you more man I will be thinking about you

No, the world and each of us are getting screwed by it.
Me losing money or gaining money in the stock market as a result of volatility is not in any way adding to the suffering going on. I can clearly demonstrate that me making money in the stock market at this point in time is beneficial to myself and my community.

That said if you truly feel bad about profiting from the pandemic. I can provide you a venmo account name that you can send all the money you want, and You can pretend that you took all of that money as losses in the market which somehow washes away your sins of making money.

Guessing which stock to go up has been super easy lately, no lie. If you picked ANY EV or related, charging battery or material company you'd have gotten some sick returns. And if you didn't see that trend happening you were blind. Most those stocks sat at a resting price for months before instantly being rocketed up, it's all about timing. Retail organizes so quickly now - you can read social trend data as a catalyst for sector (borderline FOMO) hype in overlooked companies.
I have hundreds of positions. Some of them are going to lose money. Facts
Reits. Ivr two
I'm not timing it down to a date. Just seems it's not really feasible for the price to go up so fast without a correction. Back in 1/2018 it did take about 20 days for it to correct at this high of divergence from the 200 MA. I'm looking at the chart and I just don't see any examples. Back in 1/2011 it went that high but slightly over a month later it corrected. The only example I can see that contradicts it is actually to the downside in the 9/2008 crash, but that only went 6 months before correcting to the upside but there were some big rallies in there too so it wasn't straight down.
Please link your source for that

Who the hell conducts 100 trades in a single day?
The mere fact that we are above 200 day MA doesn’t make it any more likely that we will crash. We could just as well continue to climb.

Stock prices aren’t truly random, they are serially correlated. So in fact, it is even worse than gambler’s fallacy to bet against the trend. Just ask any TSLA short from last year how it worked out for them. 

MA is just one piece of evidence. You would need to look at several other indicators as well as fundamentals to have any realistic chance of success. Even so, you’ll likely be more successful betting the trend.
If they don’t joke about it, what can they do?

Just because LAZR was a success (so far), doesn't mean Gores' next SPAC will also be a homerun. The Gores group has had 4 SPAC mergers so far, this one with UWM being the 5th; the timeline is as follows:

* Nov 2016 GRSH --> TWNK (yes, that Hostess) **$13.82**
* Oct 2018 GSHT --> VRRM (Verra Mobility) **$12.99**
* Feb 2020 GRSH --> PAE (Pacific Architects and Engineers) **$9.82**
* Dec 2020 GMHI --> LAZR (Luminar) **$31.40**

Out of these four acquisitions, only LAZR has really stood out. I've seen GHIV being shilled as \`the company that brought you LAZR' and wanted to give some counter-arguments. I've seen others commenting on RKT not doing so hot since their IPO (I haven't personally researched much into real estate tbh) just to add to the bear case.

That being said, GHIV is trading right now at **$10.32**, so the potential upside could be huge with relatively low risk. Tread carefully tards.
If you’re buying calls your max loss is your max investment. Only with buying them

GME $0 valuation by 2025.
We just were discussing this.. up your game with an ebike!
Well, about that...anecdotally it sounds like there are people who lost their jobs during the pandemic who are trying to use RH to strike it rich using their last few hundred dollars in savings buying options.  

The likelihood of you selling inflated priced contracts to an experienced fund manager vs. to some poor schlubs who think that Black Scholes is a boating term is pretty low.  

So, it is very possible that you are in fact robbing desperate poor people who have very little idea of what they are doing.  It just makes it easier since you can't see the person on the other side of the trade.

What spx positions?. I'm thinking of allocating 20% of my portfolio into spx calls. Then rebalance by buying more spx calls if my allocation drops.
I'm 2/2 with my daily 10 baggers this month (FUV & CLF), one even ran to 300x next day without me

Is this heavily bullish or bearish for my next retard move? I need help guys. Do I take profits or take out loans?

Thanks for the help. I was wondering how much could I end up losing more than the investment when betting on calls.
The asteroid is called apophis. it's going to fly by really close in 2029, lower than some of our satellites. When it does that we'll know it's trajectory on its return trip in 2068. And if it's going to hit us. It's not a planet killer but if it did hit us it would fuck a lot of shit up and kill millions of people. And based on the markets responding to the pandemic. This would be one of the most bullish mother fucking things ever. Buy calls on everything in 2068
Working in a call center is solution for someone wanting to off themselves ?? Fuckoff u sheltered  kid, you probably still got mommy making you lunch and aint got a clue.

Yes, I just bought 500 shares of GME. I’ll profit this coming Tuesday I swear, if not. PLTR will make me win.

No
Yeah, that doesn’t justify ATH when their parks aren’t even at full capacity and shit. No one is going to the movies. They reported a fucking loss last quarter.
First - you’re on the wrong sub to ask these questions. 

But this is your freebe - answers are below:

1) Depends, you could own as much as you bought. 
2) I’ve used TD, E-trade, and robinhood. I personally like ETrade.  

3) You can close options if there is someone to buy it. Liquidity in options is important. 

You’re asking how much you can make in options? I’ve made $5k in one day, others have made $100k. Just depends on your position size and move in the underlying stock.
These meme stocks are starting to get loose around the edges from so many people sticking their cock in them expecting some miracle.

History has shown stocks that people in WSB charge into usually will not move after earnings, HOWEVER, $GME is the most shorted stock on the market.  Market makers would want this to blow upwards to screw over the shorts.

Will it

* Go really really high just so the shorts will give up only for it to collapse down or
* Not move much to screw over all of us option buyers here on WSB
Peace and blessings bro
TRNE been having a nice little run. Anyone else been loading up?
Generally Pretty risky. You can lose at most the premium that you paid. 
I use Robinhood, so that’s all I know. 
You can sell whenever, even same day. Pattern day trading also applies. Good luck.
Was thinking the same actually. It never wanted to leave those floors yesterday.
Want to get a hot take. Correctly made a 1/15/21 Intel 50C a week or two ago, what do you say, cash out or let it ride? Currently mid 52 dollar range.

They lessen the risk, but there is still risk. Typically,  if your maximum profit is $100, your maximum loss will be about $200.

I don’t think it is 40% man. It is around 25%, which admittedly is still a big drop. They have an event in January so I think there will be a run up to that. In the short term it could pull back to 35.  I am looking to open a new position in NIO next week.
Haha, okay! Another beautiful difference between Belgians and Dutchies. We love ya guys <3
Where do you learn the function of TA? What evidence is it based on? What is the foundation of the theory? Because some schmuck once said "oh yea when the chart looks like this it will do this". It doesn't really seem to have a lot of basis to me. 

I really don't understand what people base the theory of TA on. I feel it's for people who can't understand how shit works, or can't accept that you don't get to understand the market. 

Maybe you can help me wrap my head around it.
I dont think Boris Yeltsin is a very handsome man tho :(

Depends. If the girl was amazing and awesome in bed, you may never get over it. Happened to me, beautiful blonde girl that loved to fuck and was intelligent and horny as hell. Lost her when I went to Europe and stayed too long. Still think of her often cause the gf I have now doesn’t compare in bed :(
I'm not saying to buy puts or when it will correct, just that it will in the near future by all empirical evidence. the laws of effect of price on demand haven't been repealed.

Dude every day I read the same posts from people trying puts because market is to high and every time they lose their money. Eventually one of them might be right but 95% will never time it and gain.

His not-cunt vs cunt version is basically the same as alpha/beta. Also, I agree with the fact that wsb is by far my fav subreddit. I barely check any other sub anymore. Wsb is life
True there are some differences, but I think the general idea fits. Wasn’t trying to be a dick, I just see a lot of people fall into the trap of looking solely at MA or RSI and trying to time a reversal. Great way to lose money. Need to look at other indicators to confirm.

No you don't belong here because you should pull out now while you're ahead
I saw someone on here one year ago (February)  ask “what about the weekend Dow?” And for some reason it’s always stuck with me
I mean you can hope on this trade but the squeeze will only happen IF the shorts get really spooked. You need one of these things to happen for that:
1. Clear buyout on horizon (not happening or really really unlikely)
2. Very good news for GME fundamentals (very unlikely) 
If this happens you will be good. Very good if you manage to really hit the top. 

However, if only good /neutral news comes along most likely shorts will slowly wind down, probably side ways trading around 15-20. If bad news comes along my guess is that longs will unwind and leave WSB with the bags.

So if you got lots of shares around 5 keep it and hope for big pay or good pay... Very risky to buy in at current price
Bro your prediction was right! I bought in and came up! Just wanted to say thank you very much!
too brainy

It's not a gambler's fallacy. We aren't talking about chance here. Large markets can only grow in value at a certain speed. We aren't talking about one stonk. And I'm not saying the market crashes 50% and never recovers for 20 years. I'm just talking about a -6% correction like it's done every 2 months now since August. Geesh.
The best way to learn is to fail a few times first

This thread gets really depressing on the weekends
Nice, great meme 😎
I'm very sorry to hear that man, I know what you're going through it really is incredibly tough. Remember that you're not weak but incredibly strong for living with such a difficult situation. Your mind will try to tell you that you're nothing and useless but you're conquering a battle every single day. I agree you should try other meds, if SSRI and SNRI don't help you need to find a doctor that's willing to try anti convulsants and anti psychotics. If none of those work and you can find a clinic that takes insurance Ketamine infusions can work wonders for long term depression, although the effects wear off after a few weeks it can help you kickstart your life. Also if you smoke weed or drink regularly quitting help a bunch as well. I noticed my meds worked not as well when I was a daily smoker. You really need to act now get on it fast and be ready for a long journey but at the end you will be so glad you did it. Like seriously set up an appointment Monday if possible,  the longer you wait the more you struggle. If I can find peace (I have multiple chronic illnesses on top of my anxiety/depression) then I know you can too.
This guy's got a good point

My dear friend alphabet song, I know spelling is difficult for me. Where I clearly meant to type "shutting the door" and wrote something else.

I in no way said I condone anything of the sort. So I don't understand how you read my previous statement and arrived at that conclusion. 

What I failed to convey because you clearly did not understand the meaning I was trying to get across.
I would not interpret or extrapolate out from his actions that in any way he is broken, changing his position, or otherwise deterred. .

I believe he saw that he was being harassed by idiots on the internet, then metaphorically "flipped them a double bird" and went about removing any of his observations or insights into the company. 

In my mind I see this is very much a Matthew chapter 7 type incident. Someone is casting pearls before swine, and they realize what they are doing. So naturally he picked up all of his pearls of wisdom and went home.

The point is that I think the people who are inferring that somehow the Tesla gang or cult demoralized him are wrong. I see it as a smart guy basically deciding to leave fools to their own destruction, and making some very good literary references while he does it.

Yeah right. When TSLA was trading like rest of the auto companies in market cap around this time last year, people were claiming this company could never make a profit selling cars and it came pretty close going belly up due to the Model 3 ramp. Then they started churning out profits ever since Q3 2019 and the market thought this could be the next biggest thing ever.

The industry experts* were clearly wrong about Tesla, for YEARS.
Yep. 99% will be pump and dumps.

I can't tell if you're trolling my man. You're gonna risk 80k for $2016 credit? Even the $4356 is ridiculous. If you're banking on the stock not going lower than $22 by 12/11 why not own a fuckton of shares and buy a few calls? There's an absolute, very real chance pltr goes below $22 on opex week.

Sage advice. Buy things when everyone else is buying, with a high IV and a week till expiration. 

And then wait for rumors.

It's a little cheesey but good info for the most part. It's kind of a 20-25 type of book but it still is good for getting out of a rut -The Subtle Art of Not Giving a  Fuck by Mark Manson.  


A really good one that is just insanely valuable is The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson.

I'm a huge fantasy reader so I stay away from self help and non fiction usually but went through a long self help phase where I read like 100 self help books and most of them are ass and can be boiled down to a paragraph but those two are pretty useful. I think just reading in general is good for self help because it slows down your mind, you use your imagination, and it's fun and you get to 'live' lives you otherwise couldn't live.

I made some good bank on my Occidental stock. It is up 76% from when I purchases. I sold when it was 47% up now I feel stupid. I did buy in again though. I sold because needed cash to yolo on stupid pltr trade. Now I have a bunch of my portfolio stuck in a pltr baghold. I also made some tendies on qualcomm. Still thinking about buying in on TSMC, they are fueling the AMD vs Nvidia race, the 5G race and basically all other production increases for 5nm and 7nm production.
Am I the only one who notices how far the market is above the 200 day MA? We are significantly higher above it now than in 1/2018, 3/2020, and 9/2020 corrections. Any time this has ever happens it corrects

When you get to the point that it makes sense to either form an LLC for your trading activities or you are applying for active trader status. That is when you are now hunting for deductions. 

Before you actually have to hunt for deductions everything you need to know about taxes is easily available on the internet. If you aren't in a community with people who understand taxes and how it relates to trading, and you also don't have the ability to really study things on your own, you probably want to talk to a specialist before year's end and get advice.

There are a few gotchas people fall into, one very easy one is the wash sale rule, and that could absolutely screw you over.
It didn't feel right until about 2 months in. I kept a log of my anxiety and depression from 1 to 10 and a short passage every day to track my progress and I just noticed over time the depression was getting lower and lower. Anxiety stayed the same so I ended up getting an add on med and that's been 2 weeks and my anxiety has gone from a nearly constant 9 to like a 4 on average with spikes to 7 and sometimes even as low as a 2 which is unheard of for me in the last 10 years. I think antidepressants aren't for everybody, my doctor was pretty smart and realized right away that antidepressants didn't work for me and we tried two of those then an anticonvulsant and then another anticonvulsant (the one I'm on now, called lamotrigine brand name Lamictal) which has nearly 0 side effects for me, getting off of it is supposed to be not the most fun because it's a very long taper but I literally have zero side effects it's amazing. I'm also on a small dose of lithium (they're often paired together) for my anxiety and they work together really well. They're both used to treat much more serious diseases than anxiety depression but they work for both of those as well. I think a lot of doctors are scared to use anything that's not an  SSRI or SNRI. Just cause my meds are used for BPD and Bipolar and sometimes epilepsy doesn't mean they can't help with depression and anxiety. I'd recommend finding a better doctor and trying as many as you can til one feels better. Give it the proper time though. The first time I tried Lamictal I only gave it 3 weeks and stopped taking it but if I just held on another month it would have worked. It's a long arduous process but your mental health is so very valuable it's worth every ounce of time and money to improve it. I hope you can find a suitable solution for you man mental health is a fucking bitch. Message me if you ever are feeling down or just wanna vent.

It's going up because the share price didn't / doesn't maybe reflect the value of the company.
Serious question: how do you guys find that random stock that has been trading between 0 and 1$ for 3 fucking months on the same low volume then one day it fucking moons to like $8 on like 300 million volume. Premarket volume scanner? Reading the premarket news?

Edit: I want a 10 bagger to turn $100 to $1000

Only way anything gets done is if the market actually crashes. lol
Yeah also what his future gains are and if he's break even currently.  Warning is to not buy back in after the sale because the gains after a loss won't be offset by the losses.

I’m going to miss this sub. Did a 3k yolo on SpY Puts expiring Monday. Looks like they’d expire worthless. Too much anxiety and pain. Another 48 hours in this fun party and then it’s adios amigos
It’s the principle. Why tf would I pay that shit
Kinda. I don't think you ever go back to feeling 100% normal but you're in a place where depression can't overtake your entire being and you don't feel hopeless anymore. It's not like hitting a reset button but it does allow you to grow into a person that can be like that I think. I've only been on the ones that worked for me for 4 months so I have a long ways to go but I haven't had a suicidal thought in like 2-3 months and I also don't feel like a waste of space anymore. It's pretty nice

Don't do that, ever.  It is just money.  Worst case scenario is that you move somewhere cheap with roommates and get a job at a call center making 28k.  You can still enjoy life, living like that.
Here’s how this market works.

SPY sees these possible headlines. 

“Covid-19 killing Americans every 1-2 mins and record hospitalizations each day”

“Economic recovery in Jeopardy as significant shutdowns are in progress”

“JOB numbers for December will be negative”

“An asteroid may wipe out half the earth”

“The darkest winter in history may be happening”

“A vaccine may arrive in 6 months, but we have no way of transporting it.”

“Stimulus momentum is picking up.”

SPY moons 1-2% off last headline. Even though we’ve been going through the last 6 months with stimulus talks that still haven’t happened.

I bought a 165c 12/11 $MRNA should I sell?
I'm right there with you. I think there should be small pullback sometime next week to 365-6 before moon back to 377 shortly. I just hope it doesn't go to 377 then pull back to 370. Put in this market are very risky. It was a wrong play I think.
That has to be a troll. No fucking way people are THIS fucking dumb/naive
That AI IPO and Hydrofarm IPO are my plays next week. Finally let go FSLY so redirecting it to them.
Pay your fucking taxes
I take it the only way is the options way? 😎
Elon himself said margins aren't good as recently as 3 days ago. Tesla loses money on some models actually. Average PPV(profit per vehicle in case you're too retarded to understand) is roughly $3k. That is miniscule when you look at their sales. 300k sold in 2020 means around $1 million profit on the car sales without factoring in the tech side cost of employees and R and D etc.

SpaceX isnt even the same company you fucking retard. People like you are why it is overvalued because you think you're investing in rockets too with your Tesla stock. And Elon said Robotaxis 2020. I dont see them anywhere do you? They won't even be here 2021 or even 2022 or even 2023 yet is is priced like they are already here and generating revenue.

I didnt realize that SpaceX was part of Tesla or the same company. Oh wait they're not, so how is that relevant? Also it is vaporware this is why Germany said they can't advertise autopilot anymore because it isnt autopilot it is assisted driving aka the same shit tons of other companies have. Sure it aspires to FSD but it isnt there yet nor are they approved to do level 4 testing. It is priced like Tesla is doing this https://youtu.be/__EoOvVkEMo which they aren't.

You mean that the world doesn't revolve, being that it is flan and all.
Even if the indexes continue to climb, I think there will be a pullback in tech short term since as the economy reopens money will have to rotate into the sectors that are down for the year. Money can't be in two places at once.
Congrats on the gains man, don't feel bad for being successful, just be kind to those who aren't.
lol. far from it. Assume your yearly marginal tax rate is 20%.

if you invest and lose 3k in year 1. your tax bill on your investments is $0. Then in year 2, you invest and gain 10k. You can now carry over the losses from year 1 into year 2, and instead of paying taxes on 10k (2k in taxes), you only have to pay taxes on 7k (1400 in taxes) since you can reduce your lo gains by 3k due to the carryover loss.

Ok, low key, look up delta heading. If an MM sells an option with .2 delta, they buy 20 shares  of the stock to hedge. 

Stocks like Tesla have very few sellers since a lot of people hold the stock bc they want to stop global warming. This means MMs are buying in a very illiquid market and it forces the price up.

If you buy tons of OTM options, it is very cheap to force MMs to buy a ton Of shares. 

I made a post about this, but I bought 30 otm options on gme and estimate that forced MMs to buy ~$5000 of shares and it only cost me -$1600. If we all do this, stocks go up!
You’re fine man it’ll be up hugely by then
SPY 370c here - currently praying to the stock market gods
At least it's still green.
Honestly, I think he’ll be alright if he doesn’t sell. I’d advise selling if it’s money he can’t afford to lose, but NIO is being held down by a piece of floss right now. It dropped because the market dropped, then some other EV companies had underwhelming news, then the auditing bill was passed. None of those thing necessarily have anything to do with NIO’s outlook. In that time, NIO reported more than 100% delivery growth yoy, and had a price target increase from morgan stanley. I’m really surprised it’s still being held down. 40 also seems to be a strong support.

I'm not sure how long you've been trading, but almost everyone suffers a loss early on. Some are lucky that they still had a small account by then. It will probably take you a little bit before it hits you, but at some point, you may be on the bus, at work, shilling at home, and suddenly the magnitude of your loss is going to weigh on you. Mine hit me at work and i had to step out of a meeting to recompose myself.

That said, you are in a great position since most of the principal (200k in carryover losses would suck) still stayed intact. The first thing you have to work on with trading is the mentality. Another pitfall most people fall through is the "revenge trading", where you are making trades to "recover money". Lesson number 1, you can **NEVER** recover money. Any loss you make is gone, and you move on. Take it from someone who fell into this trap early on and doubled 1 bad loss trying to get it back instead of looking at why i failed and changing strategies.

And yea, early on in my trading, when my account would move 4 figures in a direction, i was filled with absolute euphoria or dread. But as time went on i started getting more and more dissociated from the money, which had the opposite effect for me. I was essentially able to make less emotional trades when it was up or down big, stick to a plan, know when to cut losers and when to take profits.

If i may ask, a glance at your submitted shows you were doing ICs. Where did your losses come from? ICs or otherwise?

Good luck bro, and please take a break and re-examine before getting back in.
Hasn't SPY been tanking on the week of opex leading up to the day of or following Monday? Seems like week of the 18th we'll see a correction. Not to say it's anywhere near predictable just saying

Prob not a terrible move but if a correction does come in the next couple months reits might extra correct cuz they’re so at risk in people’s mind

Depends what sparks the correction. If it’s a no stimmy deal news then reits will plummet imo

In practice, I'm not sure it ever worked like that. I mean sure it creates more trading volume in a stock, but it's also a common tool to manipulate stock prices. And whenever somebody who is making a lot of money of a system argues the system needs to be exactly like that, we should be careful.

&#x200B;

>What this means for the stock and options trader is that if you take a loss on a stock or an option and then buy back that same stock, or an option on that same stock, whether the option is the same month and strike price or not, you have a wash sale. The same holds true if you close an option position for a loss and then buy the same underlying stock within the 30 day window.  
>  
>There is no clarification in the tax law as to how far "in or out of the money" the option is, or what month and year the option expires. So TradeLog simply applies this rule as follows: If the underlying stock is the same, then the option is "substantially" the same. For details see our [**Chart of Wash Sale Triggers**](http://www.tradelogsoftware.com/resources/wash-sales/#wash-sale-combinations) section below.

There is usually a set time. Probably a couple of days. 

In any case, look at the 5 year chart for RH. They were a failing company with 80% short to float. They went 10X, but it too 3 years. So, investors had 3 years of above market returns!

A short squeeze can last hours or years, it just depends on how stubborn the shorts are.
A Latina. 

Notice you said nothing about being freaks in bed, imo being a whore in the sheets is super important
going to work or giving a hand job to that smelly homeless man you often see
And after that? TSLA. And after that? I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s TSLA.

I stopped for six months and came back with a new perspective. Getting back to even after being down 80% with almost only stock. After realizing how balanced options is with it’s risk and reward, became much more selective about entering any positions. 

Just buy stock in an established company, or keep your money out. Before you learn how to trade, you need to learn when it’s wise to risk money in the first place. Gambling money to get out of debt is a horrible idea. Take the first steps to getting out of debt, little by little. Any progress is good.
Imagine working in a shitty job if you have 1 mil... Ay lmao

JD is super oversold. Next year they are getting deep into financial services.
I think you’ll see a move this week where either MMs short it to make a better entry point or another rally - my guess is the former
Obviously each spac is a little different, but typically founders don't just get a block of shares 2.5x the size of the full class A stock. It's usually a smaller percentage of warrants or different class of stock that can be converted at some point.

It sounds like you're trying to roll the PIPE, warrants, and all the other classes of stock into your calculation, otherwise I can't imagine how you'd get near your 8x number.  Those typically don't get added all at once and they definitely wouldn't be included in a pre-merge market cap - which makes this conversation moot since we're talking about their market cap a month ago before merger.

A spac doesn't magically have a higher market cap because there are more shares vesting later, market cap is the shares that are available times the price. Which is why spacs have low liquidity - low number of shares trading, indicated by low market cap, thus the ban.

Fucking Barron’s articles.

“All three major U.S. stock indexes soared to record closes in the face of disappointing jobs data. Investors are hungry for stimulus, and are more convinced it’s coming.”
The usual argument is, it provides liquidity to the market. If everyone expect a stock to drop in price nobody will trade it. 
A market were nothing is traded is by definition not a market.

Also as the other person who answered you said, short selling is a thing merchants did, before the raise of a stock market. Back in times when practices like "just in time delivery" weren't even thinkable.

I like it. I’d rather buy a vertical put spread though. I doubt UUP will go below $22 in that timeframe. Maybe a 24/22 P spread. The cost basis is roughly $0.30 per contract with a ~6:1 payout to loss ratio. Or, if you’re really bearish you can do the 23/22 P spread. The cost basis is only $0.06 per contract, so the payout to loss ratio is 12:1.

I have 50k in 25/30 debit spreads expiring dec 2021. If it hits i make 200k so I'm praying for a good company. I'm young and single so decided to yolo a bit. If it doesn't hit I'll be sick and really upset for a few weeks but it won't ruin my life so I thought fuck it why not. Also if it hits I can quit my job look for a new one and buy a condo.
This also allows you to load up on the YOLO. If a spread is $200, you can buy 100 of them with your 20k. Instead of maybe 20 without the spread. So you can make 100 times the spread, and it only has to go up the spread amount to make full tendies
Easy mode. Hedge funds are buying ass tons of JD and BABA stock and laughing at all the dumb retail that dumped it.

Well if you borrowed a stock and sold it short, and than the stock price rises, your short position is red. 
So you want to cover your position, and rebuy the stock.
So you go to the market place an order for the stock.
Sadly, so do all the other shortsellers. All of that demand all of a sudden raises the stock price.
But because the price is raising no one wants to sell now, and people wait till it's up a little more, so the shortpositions are in the red a little more, and more shortsellers try to cover, etc.
There are a couple of cases were the price rocketed up more than 1000% in a very short time.

I think it’s ~70% of options contracts expire worthless. Use basic technical analysis to sell before resistances, and be comfortable with modest returns. 

I just sold a call for a 50% return that jumped after hours and will probably be closer to 250%, and I’m alright with it. Theta is no joke.
i'm about 9 months new so i'm enjoying the discussion as well.

You're right, I messed up scenario b. It should read stock goes above 188: I make \~20% premium and 100 \* (170-131). 

I think it just comes down to risk vs. reward? and also work. I kinda do this for fun and to me it doesn't sound fun to be making weekly decisions like that selling calls. What if PLTR is really booming? Maybe I'm a little hesitant to sell calls. If you're selling weekly calls on NIO you would have lost on huge gains the lat month when NIO just exploded. 

&#x200B;

With the apple scenario it's safe and it's a little fun where i can check in every now and then and buy back calls and sell again or something else. I honestly hate making decision so I feel like with Apple i can mostly sit back and let it do it's thing. I see verry little risk in actually losing money in my scenario.

But yea idk i'm 9 months new to this so i'm honestly just using this as a learning experience.

Or a market wide crash. TSLA is included in sp500 now. If people sell spy, people sell tsla, price drops, everyone realizes they always knew tsla wasn't worth this much, they sell, ad infinitum. It just takes one strong downward push and this bubble is over.

What’s your guess price would be before merger? Been sitting on 63,000 warrants at $2.43 for 3 months. Great to see 6 figures gains finally. Would you be trimming down your position before merger?
How so?
I have so many calls on it, I hope so. When I'm sober, like I was this morning, it shocks me how much faith I have on it not falling. From what I read, I sense it's like an early-mid stage Amazon, with lots of bold expansion ideas, some involving cutting-edge tech
Ok im noob so bought shares yesterday, but when do I sell? When ticker changes? Everywhere I look says it will take a couple business days? When will it peak thanks

Have you seen the cars that are out from NIO, BYD, and XPENG?  They are on par with what Tesla is offering, some are better.  I don't think they need battery tech from the US as the two largest battery makers, CATL and BYD are in China innovating on their own.

Tesla signed a deal with CATL to supply batteries.  I think your view of China's battery industry is dated.  Batteries isn't some mythical tech that only Tesla can do, lol.  Panasonic and LGchem make auto batteries and Tesla buys from both.
Ah okay, good luck saving till then

What are the chances of PLTR shooting up anytime soon?
In a strange turn of events I moved 1/10th of my calls to ACB from FCEL right before ACB dropped Friday. I could have sworn ACB was in a bull market for the first time, ever... I wasn’t even high. More super pissed at the institutional investors in FCEL manipulating the cost and seemingly waiting till I closed position until it started rising. “Ok so it’s like 5 mins behind SPY? Sell” Not this time fucker... rise to 8 fuck your gains... 

None of this makes sense to me anymore... hoping cannabis will save the day again 🤣

Good job and fuck you
I’ve done this three times now... for a final move of madness I moved 5k of plays from FCEL to ACB right before ACB dropped on Friday. Perfect timing! And companies announcing offerings right left and centre fucking my account... trading is fun isn’t it?! Woke up in a panic attack this morning and searched for news articles on ACB. First one read: “ACB valued as 0 dollars” excellent. Most of my original account was a loan anyway. Wouldn’t have been fair if I had made bank from it 😅
LOL. If the squeeze starts before it hits $25, you will likely not get to sell at $25. Even your retarded $25 limit order will probably get filled at $40 or something.
Bro it’s already targeted at 60 the run to NIO day should go past 70
Hydrogen is being implemented slowly in small projects.  Think industrials, plastics, petroleum industries, forklifts, construction vehicles.  Once it gets cheaper to produce and it will; hydrogen will be in large parts of the economy.  

The best mobility use cases are airplanes and ships.  You only need hydrogen storage at airports and ports, the source and destination.  Airplanes and ships go one route; the same route all the time.  I don't believe hydrogen will work for autos as you will need a full scale infrastructure.

You have an accountant, and you just now broke 100k for the first time?
You can sell some of them, sell against them to make spreads, or just hold if you're confident. I have a similar basis and can give you hints on mechanics for getting a lower-delta position, but I can't make the choice for you. I'm psychologically comfortable with losing 20k, which is why I have 20k in options.

Haha. It is Friday, so traders want to close their position and panic people into selling. Many cannot do with thoughts of price going down for 2 days because there is no activity. Also I'm holding shares, I can wait. It will eventually go back up in 1,2,3,4 etc. weeks. This is not sports. Plus the price has been consolidated, that's what I meant by worst is over.

Nah man.  According to Elon in 2017; it's already here and we are also taking robotaxis right now in 2020.  Now the cultists are saying FSD, as in level 5 in 2024 lol.  I agree with you; it won't be readily available to the public by at least 2030.  No government will be approved in the next 5 years.

The idiots who purchased the FSD package back in 2018 would have done exponentially better buying the stock than the package.  Tesls's best product is it's stock.
To know what days is great for fishing I pull the covers down on my hubby if leaning to the right I fish the right side and if leaning to the left I fish on the left and on the days I am pulling them whoppers in left and right
But, when it's standing straight up... Honey, that ain't no fishing day!
No expert either, but think of it this way, why does a stock price go up?  Because no one is willing to sell it to you below the current price.  The Sell order wall is basically a shitload of people all willing to sell their tesla stock at $600, all of that volume has to be eaten up before the stock will rise above it, not to mention all the people that might panic a bit when the price stalls out and refuses to break the $600 threshold and put up their sell orders.

Gonna take some serious Muskiness to push, but honestly, it's TSLA, so it'll probably be 1k by New Years cause fuck logic.

Dude stfu you little pussy bitch. I have 17.6k tied up in collateral for selling PLTR puts. We are mooning and I don’t wanna hear anymore sad boy bullshit
Yeah I realized that aswell. My bet is it will drop like a rock. But I think there will be a lot of movement for PLTR, so I hope the IV will go up again.

i think taking advantage of the dip is smart. i bought my 45c friday and I’m just trying to make a decent amount on it. but yeah i'd say go for it, not much more room to drop imo. i think pltr has been corrected enough for a bit
>No, not at all. The person who owns or shorts the shares sold you that, and they collected the premium. Your broker is the middle man who takes the commission which with Etrade is 50 cents.

interesting, so in the above case the 600 Million in volume represents how many call contracts there are in place, so that would be that there is 600 million sell contracts also in place.
I keep a fixed balance then siphon off in 5/10k increments. Keeps one grounded & focused (I have a problem with getting reckless when the balance swells). To each their own.
It's safer which means less risk which means less reward but if you do it right, your account will gradual increase rather than have insane swings like most people on this sub.

How has it proven to stop the spread rate when we don’t fully understand the spread rate? I tested positive for corona on two separate tests, I had slept breathing on my wife every night up to testing positive. She works in various nursing homes so she quarantined with me and took 7 tests in 14 days and not one came back positive. 

The risk factor of the world population is definitely unknown. There’s a general guideline as to who it does what to yes, but if there’s an answer to why do some lose taste and smell, others have no symptoms, some deathly sick before recovery and others it kills I have not seen it explained other than speculation. 

I believe I said testing and isolating those infected have proven to stop the spread, but wearing a mask is also vital to that process. This has provable results by the numbers of infections over time in countries that did this (check South Korea if you need more examples I’ll provide) 

You sound like a real patriot with that explanation of how the vaccine was whipped up so quickly. Covid-19 has been a known virus for all of maybe a year and you believe we nailed the vaccine already? Maybe we have but knowing the history of vaccine development, specifically the vaccines involving coronaviruses I’m going to say fat fucking chance. 
First time using AI and machine learning to cut time on development for a vaccine we’ve known about for one year is less than a comforting explanation as to how we got it done.
Isnt the fall in share price due to share dilution from the acquisition?

Hey bud, it sounds like you can spot a good trade. 

I'd suggest that you start to make exit points before you get into a trade.

Two easy ones:
- I'll exit after I'm up x%. Start small if you have to at 20%. You'll realise at least 20% each time and you'll learn from experience if that number goes higher.
- I'll exit after it peaks and drops x%. I'm not sure what a good number is here -10% to -20% would be my recommendation.

In both cases, you'll leave some gains on the table - but you'll never lose it all. From what you've said, you're secure in being able to spot good trade potential. Stop trading like every trade is the last chance you'll ever have and you'll do a lot better.
Heck yeah

I'm really enjoying the discussion ... Hopefully you check back.

I love the long game.  Nothing wrong with LEAPS and I'm admittedly still somewhat new (2ish years) but to counter ... wouldn't your 100* gains be capped at 170, not 188.  In my experience, your shares get called away even in that 170->187 range and it's 3 years.

13k for your 100 AAPL buys you 500+ of a $25 stock (PLTR?)

5 contracts worth $40 per week nets you $800 per month and you can gain that $1800 in two and a half months instead of three years.

Again, easier said than done and more work, but even Apples not guaranteed to go up (which would be good for your sold call).

Big agree here. I could never quite price my credit spreads correctly so I reverted to short puts against box shorts. It's worked better for me but the risk/reward is super off and gets off-er when you get to the big numbers.

Not to mention a phone costs $1000 and gets upgraded every 1-3 years and has gross margins of something like 40% whereas a Tesla costs around $50k (don’t come at me with that $35k bullshit after tax credits and no autopilot price, the model 3 is over $60k with autopilot and bigger battery) and likely doesn’t make money. If you doubt this ask yourself if this company would still be around if not for regulatory credits, debt and secondary offerings? And it’s been around for almost 20 years!

It’s a curiosity for people with lots of disposable income, nothing more. I know someone who has a model 3 with autopilot but never uses the autopilot feature because he doesn’t trust it. He loves the car basically because he can check the status of it from his phone and show people all the cool shit it can do.
Sounds cool as fuck to me.

All the DD I need, $2 million margin on 350 spy puts 12/11
That makes complete sense to me. I didn’t realize this was going to be such a controversial opinion. I thought it was pretty neutral grounds but apparently I’m murdering the entire rest of the country by not taking this vaccine. I hope it works and protects those who are risk, and I’m not some antivax activist, but as far as vaccines go this certainly does not meet the standards that go into qualifying a vaccine much less one that is to be injected into the entire global population. Didn’t think I was being radical with that rationale but here I am getting crucified 🤷🏼‍♂️
Take 100k out, invest in actual stonks or more reasonable things like a house or degree. Full retard yolo the other 20k after about two weeks of DD. 

That way when you lose your ass that final time you learn to stay out of the casino. Or if it goes to the moon you make the really retarded plays since it's all fun money at that point.   

But seriously. Put six figures in your pocket and be smart with it. Don't let autists and children make you lose it all getting greedy trying to make a million off of SPY puts. Plus you'll feel like a big dick baller getting to make two max limit Robinhood withdrawals back to back.

Whiplash is never fun but take it from me, best if you plate your nutsack in titanium and sit through the ball taggings. I had two 7 figure down days in the last quarter but you can't get aggravated or panic. Then again I don't know what drove so much volatility for you - I imagine it's harder if you're carrying a disproportionate amount of long calls/puts.
Lookup the IV rank for PLTR. It was a high last week and contracting ever since. You (probably unintentionally) bought a strangle in a high IV environment, which means you’re betting that PLTR moves significantly in either direction and IV increases. Realistically PLTR will stay in the 20-30 range and IV will continue to contract, so a short strangle is a better move. I.e you want to be on the other side of your trade

There's always a way to access the market.  Without obtaining the knowledge and only dreaming of gambling, than you are already richer than if you actually have easy access to the US market, because you'll probably be in mountain of debt right now.
This diversified call option plan works great while the overall market is surging, lol. But hopefully you realize if the market chills for an extended amount of time you're gonna end up with significant losses?
the difference being that 18 year olds are exponentially growing their portfolios for free while brokers can only grow your stocks when they have insider info. The more I think about it, the more I realize that a lot of people hate WSB because it dispels the myth that the guys on Wall Street know more about the markets than the next guy when they don’t have an insider tip. It’s the same reason that people want to believe conspiracy theories about JFK, because it’s hard to believe that the head of state of the most powerful nation in the history of the world could get his head blown to bits by a 2 bit loser with a mail in rifle who got lucky.

The reason the vaccine was made so quickly is because 1) america can do anything with enough money and talent and existential threat, like the space race and 2) some of the development was copypasted from other coronavirus data we have and also this was the first time that AI and machine learning helped crunch a lot of the numbers early on which cuts time

Dude I wear a mask anytime I go out, which is only when necessary. I have social distanced the entire time. I still somehow caught it, immediately notified the few people I’ve been in contact with and stayed in my house for 14 days. Went and got tested negative before I even went to the grocery store again. The fact that everyone feels the need to attack and take shots at me for asking feedback on what I was thinking says a lot about the “accommodating” fucking community we got going on.
Where do you think we got it?
1. Don't use fear and greed to make a decision.
2. Don't go all in.
3. Don't play with options when you don't know how to protect the other side.
4. Don't get in at the top of a big run
5. FOMO is nobodies friend.
6. Cut your losses when it's a clear fail.
7. RIP his account.

Being jealous of options winners is like following a casino subreddit where the jackpot winners post their winnings all the time. you don’t see the dozens of losers that lost it all for every winner.

THE. GAME. STOPS. NOW.
The thing I wonder is what metrics do funds use to buy and sell a stock? Price level, and that’s it? I guess If it’s a long term investment they can slowly accumulate a big position over several weeks or months without bidding up the price. Or sometimes they don’t care about price and want that stock so they just slam the ask

How Maradona and Jennifer Lawrence be killed
New discovery: Tianjin Zhongshanmen’s Zhang Ying killed Jennifer Lawrence, and a large number of American girls, eating their bodies every day.  Jennifer has become very much like the ugly low essence Zhang Ying, and the girls behave like the demented, despicable, hypocritical, vulgar, and cruel Zhang Ying, Zhang Hong, Zhang Jian, Mei Lin, Huang Tao, Chen Zhu, Zhang Tao,  Liu Dianhua, Wang Jinwang, Li Zhong, Zhang Tianying, Zhang Mei and the most mean Chinese!
They killed Maradona in my body recently too!Obama and Andrew Young connected them by brain control.


Even if you tell each other privately, it’s well
Although Trump's lawsuit will come to the highest federal court, But Trump is likely to fail in the next link, just like every time human beings are destroyed by China in the global Chinese clamor. This time, China would rather abandon Xi Jinping in order to protect Chinese Americans! Chinese Americans are doing not enough, which is equivalent to doing the opposite, They haven’t said how Chinese all over the world killed all Americans. 
So truly rely on open system and Western people that is our principles, we need to do armed struggles. The premise of armed struggle is "the people know the true crime of China."  We can only rely on Western people, not Asians and people of color.
Even if the white people only tell each other privately!


Trump's lawsuit failed in Pennsylvania
This shows that there is no judge this profession in the US, the entire United States has been fully controlled by brain control! Even the rats were scurrying around the street with people wearing rat's heads, this is the Brain-control technology. In fact, the kitchen of the citizens were destroyed by Chinese, not the rats. In order to harm the US, China has new way every day, fire, shooting, "floyd", 737max, coronary virus, gay, climate, feminist ...
Only by eliminating brain control can Americans stop being slaves. 


Iran nuclear scientist was killed
In fact, this murder was done by China, In order to bring the goal of the war to Iran, not China. This was done by Brain Control, Mossad can't go to Iran to attack Iranian scientists, which can not prevent Iran's nuclear research. Trump's reaction to this, because it is beneficial to Trump's re-election, so small Trump's military power. Like ”Soleimani”, it only increase hatred.
This indicates that Biden is a anti-revolution completely, the people can't have any fantasy for him.


After killed Maradona, China took another step toward its goal
Once again, there was a public murder, and only Trumps were still disobedient. HumanHuman only had a few decades when they had image materials and no brain control. Now only relying on brain-controlled cannibalism to become a star, no arts, no civilization in the world. In contemporary technology, human will never have freedom, and be put in “matrix” by China and connected to a computer to live a lifetime in a dream.


Why is Biden wrong?
Not say:he helped China kill all American people; Surrendered to China; changing the world to brain control; exterminating human civilization……
Only say he contact with China: You married a wife. She is wanting to kill you every day, wants to put poison in your bowl, you still eat his food every day yet, She wants to kill you with a knife every night, You are still sleeping on the same bed with her.


Why did the Chinese suddenly become good?
Suddenly U.S. Chinese support Trump, opposes election fraud. Even the Chinese do not know why the Chinese democracy activists have become good people? Because they intend to abandon exaggerating Biden, his crazy fraud is easily exposed! China wants to turn criminals into aristocrats and rulers. All U.S. Chinese killed all western people! China wants to create another victory like the independence of Taiwan, the democratic movement, and East Turkistan.



About me
（Therefore, for 20 years, all world'politics have been led by Tianjin”zhi bu sheng huo”magazine where I worked. Now Zhang Tianying,police Cui,police Zhang Yi and Tianjin police officers are killing Amy Coney Barrett Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by brand -control! Please inform her.）
  China has ruined me, so ruling the world. For more than 20 years, China has destroyed me and destroyed the bodies of stars, elites and politicians all over the world. China has also controlled brain control personnel around the world, stealing technology, controlling political parties, and ruling the world!
  I have been maimed by China for the rest of my life. I didn't know anything before and didn't know China's brain control technology.
  Among them, all my relatives did a lot of bad things, they destroyed all humanity!
  People of justice all over the world have been helping me, but China’s aggression has made them extremely dangerous. I still want to fight for this world！
  China has cut off my genitals, muscles, organs, bones, and brain. China does not allow me to have work, money, wife, relatives, or friends. Almost all people in China are involved in killing my mother.
  If I return to China, I think I will die soon, in a prison or mental hospital.
  My father and all my relatives are the most direct killers who killed my mother, me, my sister and the people of the world!
  China ruined all my money and health. OnlyOnly after this， China told me some truths. I didn't know about brain control before.
  I knew things lately, Maybe Americans have gone bad！So I should go to the United States earlier, But I am blocked by China.


Only rely on the guns
Election fraud and unfair medias alone indicate that U.S. is undergoing a coup. The coup is not only against the president, but also against the people. Only people and guns can re-put justice into the system!


The upper people can never rely on elections
China has done a lot of bad things in the US by rogues and democratic party, The US has been perished. Now Illiterate housewives lead the country, Traitors are killing the people and became presidential candidates.
For example immigrant population, because of the democratic system, the US has become a Low-level country. In theory, the upper people can never win.
America is no longer America. 


will be only massacre in U.S.
Will be from Pearl Harbor to Auschwitz, Will not just Brain-control wave guns.
Trump will be put into prisons; Artistic theory will be publicly modified; thus, the real athletes will be put into mental hospitals, and the real artists will be killed. All strong people will be negatived, and be killed. All things immediately.
Because China and the US Democratic Party want a Brain-control world, they only need to do one thing----to kill all good people!


The election is completely controlled by the Brain-control
Although some good people are Brain-control player.
Brain-control player:” In order to find and kill the good people, China deliberately made Trump win in 2016.” In a sentence, I understood all things! The names of the states and the results of the votes show that the brain control completely controls the election results. So we got all the correct explanations: Why did Trump announce victory, stoping counting, to sue? Why did U.S. Chinese support Trump? In recent years, all the world things were inorder to lure good people, find and kill them. So Trump has tried to do the biggest effort in limited power, he can't say brain control, can't launch the war, can't tell people the truth ...... Trump is the only good person.
So China made shootings and wanted to prevent people from uprising by banning guns. China doesn’t want the Systems, economy, politics, only needs to dominate brain-controls. All brain controllers are low essence. Just kill all good people, China can rule the world! The people don't know this knowledge.
Only Chinese and Obama do not let me eat, Bidden is not that. So the American people should go to civil war, only need to kill all U.S. Chinese.


What’s all of this world
It's brain control. All political, economic, cultural, scientific, social life is directed by brain control, no open systems, only brain-control system.
Every thing in dark is sinful. Changing body properties by particle beam irradiation, then use different waves to activate various pre-made body, then Get the needed flesh, parts or whole. You are easily “possessed" by others with Ubiquitous waves this world. Others can know your thoughts, control your thoughts and behaviors.
Humans only divide into good and bad, the controlled people are good, the controller are bad. No border, no systems, so some questions had answer, China rules the world because it controlled brain controllers all of world.
It is interesting that the West surrendered China, because politicians are just for a little benefit. The western people are extremely miserable, China's hereditary "anthropophagy" system was transplanted to the West, Western flesh, skills, knowledge, ideas, temperament, social status, willpower…… are all “eaten”, brain control technology can get everything of human by waves.


Because this world is a slaughter of the weak people to the strong people
Because of being led by China, the world’s contradiction is between brain control and non-brain control, that’s a contradiction between the weak people and the strong people too. The Russians are strong and will not be very willing to be ruled by China in the future. All Western people have been killed by China, western countries are so willing, because they are the capitalist system.
But Russia is not the capitalist system.

Interesting take. Seems like injecting myself with a vaccine for a virus we’ve only known about ~8 months and changing lanes in a car is a bit of a stretch but I get it. I wear a mask. I’ve social distanced. I stayed in quarantine in my house 14 days when I caught covid. Why is vaccination what everyone believes is the answer to stopping the spread when that’s unproven. But it’s very probable in several countries that mass testing and isolation of those infected stops the spread highly effectively?

That’s a lot of self entitlement to ask people to die because you want to infect them with a virus that you don’t even fully understand instead of getting a vaccine researched by scientists who study new viruses.

Like sure we will do more studies and prove exactly how much it protects you and for how long. But just like all the similar vaccines, early data shows it does and it’s just a matter of measuring how much.

I bet you think the Tuberculosis vaccine is a killer too

Someone fat fingered
Vaccine has zero provable evidence that it stops the spread rate. We actually don’t fully understand all the ways it spreads, all the effects that come with it, why it has no symptoms with person A, and kills person B you could argue we don’t have a vaccine for Covid-19 based off the fact that we don’t fully understand Covid-19. 
I hope it works and has no unforeseen side effects. But I would strongly argue against vaccine being the answer to stop spreading. Mass testing and isolation of those infected has proven to be highly effective against stopping the spread. Vaccine whipped up in ~8 months has little proof of anything.

Sdnah dnomaid
thats not how any of this works

we need to reduce the spread rate as much as possible so that means as many people need to be vaccinated as possible

otherwise it’s still largely active and moving around and can mutate into something we dont have a vaccine for, at which point you’ll truly see society begin to fail
I've seen many people say this, but none have been able to provide evidence of it actually happening
Is that really how it works he owes them that money?
Well I'm not sure what way it will go, it is probably a coinflip. - I'm just throwing a very little amount of money on it is going down due to the "inverse WSB" tactic.
The issue is some people can’t safely get a vaccine because they have compromised immune systems so they rely on other people getting it

But yeah if most people get it then it will mostly work out

If you’re worried about covid and want to get the vaccine, I’m happy for you. If you’re not worried about covid and don’t want the vaccine, I’m happy for you. Should be no issues because those not vaccinated understand their risk and are choosing to take it. Those vaccinated are now “safe” from covid and can be around those unvaccinated that may have it.

Ex div was thursday, stock doesn’t ever lack volatility in a good or bad economy, cyclicals have made a fierce comeback while D has dropped giving D the potential for a huge bounce back. The only way I see D not going over the $80 range is if the economy completely tanks, which I don’t see a huge slip until mid December. I mean, .20 isnt shit for risk on an otm call, and the 75 call is damn near 80 delta. Oil and energy have been enjoying nice 10% gains on decent days. Time to buy in and sit. Go ahead and feel free to sit this one out. I’m going so heavy 30 minutes into open that I am hoping to force someone into a delta hedge. 10 days of trading to rebound 10% on cyclicals in this market is a freebie I will happily take.

I neither canceled the reservation at Turtles nor told Courtney not to meet me there, so she’ll probably show up around eight-fifteen, completely confused, and if she hasn’t taken any Elavil today she’ll probably be furious and it’s this fact—not the bottle of Cristal that Evelyn insists on ordering and then adds cassis to—that I laugh out loud about.

How does shorting a stock impact the operations of a company?

Yeah if you read about the management they’re very smart. Already did a stock split to keep it cheap etc

They’ll do whatever it takes to show a profit the next few quarters and take the stock higher 👌

Yes, I agree 100% on that, everything is relative. And I’ve lived in some rough places but the only starving-esque persons were clearly addicted to crack or meth. Overall, if there’s a chance I end up on the streets broke and starving, I’m glad it’s in America is my point. I have much more respect for a Chinese complainer than an American one, and the way America exploits their and India’s labor alike is the closest thing we have to modern day slavery imo

Why
If it goes that high, I’d earn several years of salary. Enough to retire. I don’t expect that to happen, but I’ll let it happen if it’s in the cards. Good luck to all of us. Remember to have a plan no matter what happens and stick to it. And don’t forget about taxes.

I'm not sure someone getting excited about $100 has much tax burden to be worried about

Show us your $D DD.
Yup shares mean you’re successful and actually own part of one of America’s greatest companies
I'm in PLTR for $24 as of today.  I sold a put expiring next week for the same strike.  Either way, I'll have 100-200 long in that company for quite some time.
Try making another one, but have “Boomers” over the guy pumping, “APPL” over the pump, and a voiceover of a guy saying “what kind of idiot doesn’t buy otm calls?”
If u have a 4 mil div account u can safely retire by making 10K a month. That’s goals right there
They 100% are the future, but that doesn't mean GME is dead just yet. 

New gen consoles still have disks. 

They are closing stores to reduce overhead and pushing more into e-commerce with a 10% holder on the board that took Amazon on with pet food and won. 

They signed a deal with MSFT that gives them a share of all digital sales on consoles they sell. 

They're paying off their debt early. 

They have a huge amount of customer data. 

They are over 100% shorted. This shit gonna squeeze.

Yes dude, I have. Go check some underpasses in any major US city, and you'll find it.

But, this is sorta getting off-topic. The point is that I disagree with your premise that people can't be upset about being poor as shit, just because poor people have it worse in China, or whatever.

Then people in China can't really be upset because it's worse being poor in India.

And they of course can't be upset because it's worse being poor in North Korea.

etc etc.

You don't have to be the most miserable person on earth to be miserable.
Ofcourse this gets the wholesome award
Super original
Not really even $100 when you take into consideration taxes
What strike are the calls?
No, it’s a feature
Nah they gave their employees ten year option grants that expire soon or they would’ve stayed happily private for longer
Sold a few already and tried to buy back more but might have timed it a little badly.  Currently holding 10 $22c 12/18 (that I'm actually a little down) and 5 $19c 2/21.
We dont pull out brother.

I sold 75 4 Dec puts @ 17 for $1.24. GME closing above 15.76 meant profit. I really wanted the shares, so having it execute so close to 17 felt good even if it makes no difference profit-wise. I’m way overweight GME, but I see both value and momentum. I’ve been selling weekly CCs on GME while riding it up. I don’t want to risk a big move this week, so I’m holding all my shares and no CCs. I think Monday and Tuesday will be fun.
Sitting here in disbelief at the fact that a guy who I use to play on the same team as, just signed a professional sports contract for over 80 million. Shit is sooo crazy man.

Struggle with hunger = starve? Dude do you ever EVER see someone walking around genuinely skin and bones like you see in impoverished African countries? Have you seen one? And yes historically it is true, the fact that just about everyone is air conditioned with a roof over their head beats the living shit out of any other culture in any other century. But if you do find someone who is hungry I’d be glad to direct them to one of the thousands of food kitchens available to us or help them apply for the readily available food stamps.

Similar to covered calls, if the cash supporting the sold puts were simply in shares, it would face that same risk. If you sell more puts than your cash position, then you are taking on leverage.
If I were a smarter man, I’d hedge because the honest underlying variables strongly suggest another healthy downturn before things get back to more honest markets. But just as the old saying goes, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

when it's interest free, the merchant pays for it (some pre-agreed upon rate). So Peloton pays like 15-20% on interest-free loan (for the user). In fact I think interest-free loans are ~40-45% of Affirm's revenue

It's all relative right? I don't actually see it as that much money given that I'm 31 and unmarried. There's a lot of life ahead and a lot of things I'd like to do. Plus, I was there in 2018 and again at the beginning of Covid. As fast as it comes, it can go. More is never enough for some of us.

2010. I saved $800 after working at REI and a pizza joint and bought shares of $TSLA immediately post IPO. After college, I was fortunate enough to join a relatively well-known tech firm quite early on that eventually IPO-d. My equity grant gave me a base upon which I could collateralize some leverage.

I went deep into what I knew. I was working in tech so I bought tech stocks. I happened to be in the right place at the right time (even though at the time it seemed like I was late to the party) as the shift to growth was really gaining steam (2017). I got assfucked hard at the end of 2018 when the Fed started raising rates but learned some lessons from ineffectual panic sales/shorts and brushes with margin calls.

Bottom line. Buy with conviction and set price targets. Don't try to get too creative too quickly. If you buy 200 shares of $NVDA at $250 and now it sits at $500, maybe open a box short against 50% of your position to return your capital/lock in your gains. But because it's a box short, you may be able to defer your taxes. If the price subsequently drops, start shorting puts against the box to monetize. If it rises, close the box, take your dollars, and roll it into something else.
I own $30,000 lmao

Depends on the strategy. Simple covered calls have less risk and less upside than just holding the shares in their own. And iron condors have hard limits on the potential loss. 

Selling an assload of naked calls is very dangerous though.
Next time just invest in nikola it’s a safe bet literally can’t go tits up

Most people are terrified of being wrong.  And they hate doing research / thinking.
Ok but... what does that matter?

If you are in a bed bug-infested apartment in the ghetto and can't afford food, what solace is it that someone in rural china is worse off?

Also, it's not so simple to compare struggle. People in rural China are dealing with completely different issues than people in, say, a project housing development in detroit. Someone in rural China might have fewer modern conveniences and have to do far more manual labor, but someone in the projects might be forced into gang life or some shit and be worrying every day about getting murdered.

There are so many different types of spreads it’s hard to say. Debit and credit. Calendar spreads. Vertical spreads. So it really depends.

If you are not nutsack deep in CRM calls right now why do you hate money so much?
I can imagine it being pretty profitable in the short term specially with California going into another stay at home order
Yeah that's why it was only twice. Was just curious and very horny. Tren is a bastard
unfortunately its worse than that. giving money is paying them to remain begging. its literally the worst thing you can do. people never seem to get this. it happens on a global scale too. if you are truly interested to make a change, read Dambisa Moyo - Dead Aid and understand how charity is a failed concept. 
We ruined Africa the same way and places like San Fran are becoming shit holes because of their failure to grasp a singular concept that throwing money at it makes it worse.

hope you come to see that you are creating the problem, not fixing it. good luck.

Man, what you are saying about fighting the markets current is spot on. Since the powers at be have committed to buoying the economy, maybe we dont see another downturn until next year if / when covid becomes more under control. But who knows. 

 Also thats very true about tech, and it will be interesting to see if that can continue

Airbnb is expected to hit market anywhere from $40-$50 might just be worth buying 100 shares and setting a stop loss incase it goes tits up

Nah, it really aint that simple. You can definitely own an iPhone and also be so poor that you can't eat.

Could be that you bought the iPhone before you went broke. Or, could be that you just made a legitimately bad financial decision and bought an iPhone you can't afford.

Regardless, though, the resale value on most iPhones is gonna be like a few hundred at best, so it's not really gonna save you from poverty if you sell it and buy some shitty huawei or some shit.

Modern society is weird af in that you can like own a nice car and nice phone and shit and be functionally poor, bedcause you are upside down on your car loan and shit

It’s a long term play. They’re not paying dividends, so I don’t think their covid performance matters so much.
Alright so someone mentioned losing money on a short-term CRM option and then I looked at the graph and it looked like an epic price but now I see everyone else talking about it too when no one was at all before - is there some kind of pump propaganda going on?

The thing I don’t like is that AirBnB doesn’t have control over the actual end result that customers experience.  When I find a sweat stained blanket at the house, it makes AirBnB look bad even though they don’t have anything to do with it.

Plus it would have been way better if they had gone public way earlier and let us ride the growth they’ve already been through.

Airbnb seems like a big deal. It’s a global platform, millennials use it to have a place to stay in almost every city and town you would want to visit in the world.

The single largest bet I ever made was in your moms pussy and here you are. If I knew you were gonna grow up and be like this I would have bought calls on TEVA and flushed you down the toilet with your SPY puts.
Not sure how I feel about them wasting money on litty concerts tho.
I sold the fuck out of everything today.

Its like 1928 right now and everyone’s drinking champagne and being merry.
>so right now you hold shares in those 5 companies. you sell covered calls for premium. and you do cash secured puts (NVDA) to pay for your margin interest?

sort of. I don't often sell covered calls because I have a tough time pricing them correctly. In fact I actually use them as a counterfactual. When the premium for the call seems too low to justify the sale/risk of disposal, I actually tend to buy them. I happen to have a large tranche of covered $TSLA calls ($182 9/21) because of some fuckery that occurred earlier in the plague - but rather than eat a big cash loss to keep my shares, I basically turned it into a rolling tax loss that allows me to kick the can down the road. 

cash secured puts are a relatively high risk/low reward trade. If you look at my sheet, 11K in a week sounds good, but consider that if it was purely cash secured, i'd be effectively risking a half million for that. \*however\* if you have a box short, you can turn it into a win/win. that trade only really unlocks after you have some capital appreciation though. Happy to elaborate further if this is something you're interested in.

2M guarantees you $57k for 35 years. Not terrible but you’re not exactly living large even in a cheaper part of the US, and it’s even worse if you have to pay for your own health insurance.

5M guarantees you 142k for 35 years, which is not bad even in a higher-cost part of the country and paying your own medical.
No clue. But its not like they bought a $16 billion company for $425 million

If it’s worth $500 million now then you’re basically paying $500 million for $425 million worth of stock since that’s the price the deal was negotiated at. Might be worth more though but probably not more than a billion

Your strike price is 560? So that means that the higher the stock goes above 560 the more your contract will be worth. And don’t worry about break even price, that’s defined as the amount the stock would have to hit if you were to exercise your option without incurring a loss. So it only matters if you’re gonna exercise the option and buy the 100 shares. It’s basically saying that the (cost of the contract you paid for) + (the cost of your strike price of 560 for 100 shares) = (the price of 100 shares at 615 each). Sorry if how I explained it is confusing

Don't rebuy positions you lose money on after you sell it for 30 days. If you do it will be a wash sale and you won't be able to deduct it. If you don't pay attention to this you could potentially pay capital gains on a 100k of profit even through you lost it all. With so many beginners and the freedom of trade technology has brought this decade alot of uninformed traders are really screwing themselves when the IRS comes knocking.
The fact that 10k 'changes your life' is whats wrong with this country. Its not that much money, but people are kept desperate

You could have done way better than 8% a year with easy picks in the last 10 years

Investors? Sir this is a casino.
Man, that’s some fair plays. I’ve just found it way easier not to fight the market’s current. Especially when the Fed has insisted on doing nothing but propping it up by any means necessary. Also, tech seems to have gnarly bullishness no matter what.

They put in $425 million into a $16 billion plus deal

So they get like 2.6% of the company or something (you’d need to find the exact numbers but the selling company kept at least 94% and there might be PIPE shareholders too)

wow thanks so much.  been wanting to understand that since last few weeks haha. hope i can make some profit by next week. also what happens when my call option of 560 goes higher than the break even price of 615? also i am assuming i cant sell if theres no volume of call option. before it was 800ish dropped to 6 now back to 80ish

That’s pretty aggressive. An uncovered 56 C would need a 10% move to the upside just to break even. It’s not impossible, but I think a 53/55 spread would be cheaper and a bit more likely to end up positive for you. The cost basis for that spread is between $0.16 and $0.19 per contract and because of how cheap it is you can buy 100 contracts for $1600-$1900 and yield potentially $18,400 if EEM hits 55. It’s also only 7.8% move to the upside for max profit, and a break even move of 4.2%. But, if you’re thinking of putting more than $10,000 into this trade I’d be safer and buy the 52/53 spread or the 52/54 spread at most. The return for those should still be 7X or 8X and a lot safer.

Great points. I'm in with 1/08 $225 calls. Already 37% up.  I got assigned 100 shares today, have a few more in various accounts, and will probably get the CRM shares from my WORK shares if I don't sell them before the deal is closed. 

I firmly believed in Slack's fate and they couldn't have gotten a better acquirer. Now I wonder what Oracle and SAP would do about it.
I mean I'm 26 and got it right away. My brother watches it, he's 29. So I wouldn't say its uncommon for kids to get it today. Shit even when I watched it, it was already old
Just buy crm. Slack will fall before the merge. It’ll get messy
It’s pretty easy to imagine a scenario where interests rates going to 10-20% causes tones of people to default on homes (which they can barely afford now)
i had etsy spreads that were nearly worthless so i bought them back for $4 each, and soon after they would have been fully in the money and printed $250 each but i took my $4 instead

Why CRM heading up
You made less than an elementary school teacher does in a year let’s fucking goooooooo!!! 🤪🤪💯💯👍🏾👍🏾
Yeah so long as you sell it before it expires you’ll get your profit. You’re selling the contract to someone else for them to use the option to buy 100 shares. On RH the box where it says exercise option means you’d be buying 100 shares at your strike price. The person who first wrote the call (first person who sold the call contract) had to put up their 100 shares as collateral. The contract you want to sell has that persons shares that could potentially be bought.
Not that I've seen.

Not to be a party pooper but here's is best two way of playing this.   Compile all the answers into a list and find the biggest gap between the two answers that is closest to the average.  Place your bet exactly between those two answers. 

Or find the average price of all the answers given and use that as your answer.  You can take out (5%) outliers on either end to get a more accurate average if the sample size is big enough.

People here don’t understand the cannabis business as it currently operates. So many of the big companies have set up their business model around acquiring licenses. Many states strictly limit the number of licenses. This means the established companies can create a mote. If the market just opens up, there will be tons more competition and they might have to write down the value of all the licenses they are holding. Sometimes they are just hoarding licenses and not really even utilizing them. 

Margins can only go down from here. They were (still are in some states) completely absurd. Like grow a pound for $500 and sell it for $6,000 (divided into edibles, joints, grams, etc.). That’s nuts and only exists due to licensing supply restrictions. 

The starbucks of weed has yet to really emerge. MedMen’s goal was to become just that. Problem is they forgot that a retail company can’t act like a tech company and just ignore trying to actually make money as they go. 

That’s the only place I see any real gains left in cannabis. Pick the right horse that becomes a household name. Ignite also went hard in the branding but also forget you actually have to make money.

Queue the Gorilla's song, "Too many days to get lost.  Many many people I've known... got lost."  Really hits home as you grow older and you see friends and family ruin their lives with drugs etc.
Honestly, it’s because of a couple reasons why they do this. 1) because it weirdly works. It makes people think there’s an actual amount they’re working toward for something and

B) because a lot of addicts are actually only looking toward the next fix which cost them whatever they have plus x (to the cent.) it’s a fucking sad reality they’re in

Yes loss porn and gain porn is amazing I love it. Making a I hope you didn’t kill yourself because of how badly you fucked up your life post to dog the guy isn’t him caring if this dude is dead or not. If you’re in a dark place like that the last thing he needs is justification that the mistake was enough to end your life over.

SNOW's stock price has been appreciating +15% per week going at least 4 weeks back. The $450 calls are probably accurately priced considering 15% up from close today is around $445.

this starting to sound like PLTR hype. either we fly or gonna be a shitload of porn loss next Friday.
I understand your sentiment but can’t agree with your rationale. I tried PMing him to see if he was OK, but Reddit for some reason would not let my message go through. So, I thought to create a thread reaching out to him and to show him that even though we are a bunch of autists on the internet, that doesn’t mean we can’t worry and care about each other’s wellbeing. I’ve looked at his account periodically since he last posted hoping to see some activity from him because he was pretty active prior to this incident, and I know if that happened to me it would fuck me up for a while as well. I’ve taken two extended breaks from WSB and trading as a whole since I started two years ago for the sake of mental health. Seeing those losses can be really crushing. But I’m lucky enough to still be profitable since I’ve started, it just comes down to picking yourself back up and trying again.

I didn’t post any confidential info or anything, this is all info that was already out there, posted by the man himself, for us all to see. You could argue that I’m bringing attention back to it, but...that’s the whole point of my post. To both highlight an example of why we all need to be careful, and to also let someone who likely thinks they’re just a random name in a thread, know that they have left an impression on others and that we care enough to wish him well even though he’s been gone for a bit.
i'm sure there are more.

Same exact boat my friend. I don’t think there’s much we can do. I think the only move I have is to pray there’s an up trend (mine expire this up coming week.

No, not at all. The person who owns or shorts the shares sold you that, and they collected the premium. Your broker is the middle man who takes the commission which with Etrade is 50 cents.

Yeah the op talks about it like it's the right thing to do to  hold until the end. For all we know the guy did the right thing to pull out. The end result is irrelevant. And there is no such thing as true conviction. It's only blind faith and lack of knowledge in statistics.

Yes.   They’re 20 patients from their target enrollment in phase 3 trial lead by Mayo Clinic.  Selected to be in phase 2 trial lead by NIH to compare efficacy with remdesivir.

My guess Emergency use authorization is coming by mid January and Gilead or some big pharma buys them out.

“Dorsia is... fine,” I say casually, picking up the phone, and with a trembling finger very quickly dial the seven dreaded numbers, trying to remain cool. Instead of the busy signal I’m expecting, the phone actually rings at Dorsia and after two rings the same harassed voice I’ve grown accustomed to for the past three months answers, shouting out, “Dorsia, yes?” the room behind the voice a deafening hum.

“Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let’s say, in around twenty minutes?” I ask, checking my Rolex, offering Jean a wink. She seems impressed.

“We are totally booked,” the maître d’ shouts out smugly.

“Oh, really?” I say, trying to look pleased, on the verge of vomiting. “That’s great.”

“I said we are totally booked,” he shouts.

“Two at nine?” I say. “Perfect.”

“There are no tables available tonight,” the maître d’, unflappable, drones. “The waiting list is also totally booked.” He hangs up.

“See you then.” I hang up too, and with a smile that tries its best to express pleasure at her choice, I find myself fighting for breath, every muscle tensed sharply.

I bought a bit more warrants at like 7:15 eastern today when I saw the news at $4.06. Their will be a  delta between where they should be priced based off the stock price and where it trades until the merger actually happens. Warrants should have been priced at $5.5 since the stock was sitting at $17. Seemed worth the risk that the merger goes through and the stock doesn’t tank before. Luckily my other warrants where bough under $2. 

I’m not sure I believe in this company. I don’t see the subscription model working but I liked the fact that they can make money by just being an engineering company to the established OEMs.

Maybe the culture of this sub has changed because it’s gotten so many new people, but loss porn and gain porn are meant to be discussed as cautionary tales and beacons of hope respectively, especially if they showcased by the person for the amusement of others

What will end up happening is your limit will trigger.  You sit out thinking you'll time the dip and instead chase the price as it rebounds/skyrocket away leaving your paper hands in the dust.

It's bone and the font is something called Celerian Rail.  Let's see Paul Allen's card
I clear my throat. “Um, yes, I know it’s a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight-thirty or nine perhaps?” I’m asking this with both eyes shut tight.

There is a pause—the crowd in the background a surging, deafening mass—and with real hope coursing through me I open my eyes, realizing that the maître d’, god love him, is probably looking through the reservation book for a cancellation—but then he starts giggling, low at first but it builds to a high-pitched crescendo of laughter which is abruptly cut off when he slams down the receiver.

I don't think so. I mean I walk around with body builder posture. There are plenty of gays they could be asking instead.
230k
All good, gotta start somewhere. And the 105c 1/22/21 is safe I would say. They’ll be doing a stock buy back to inflate the price and if any good news comes out about sales or Xmas it’ll shoot up. I’ll be playing 110c 12/11 because I don’t like the volume and the 105c 1/22/21 for one contract is $535 on the bid and $660 on the ask. I’d rather leverage more with the 110c 12/11.
Hopefully that $2877 doesn't go with the rest.
Gimme that rumor bb
We have dozens of vaccines. It’s not quite the same as curing cancer
as you should. i love wsb bc it has legitimate philosophical strength when we decide we’re going to game the system that makes millions for millionaires by extracting from wage workers (like us). if we can see that system for what it is we better damn sure see that it’s the same game that’s responsible for people being without a home or food. it’s better to seem nice enough that someone’s comfortable asking you for more than to be such a cold fuck that someone who’s really struggling doesn’t even want to ask for help. end of the day lay down boundaries, if you wanna help someone out give what you’re comfortable and that’s it

Weeklies are just gambling (nothing wrong with that). You can make very good money with much lower risk doing LEAPS on quality companies. You don't get the crazy 90% swings that make you sick to your stomach and you can lever 100 shares for the price of a few. It's probably good to lose some money on FDs so you understand the power and danger of leverage.
Are you saying that good advice is not welcome in WSB?

No because the point of a DD isn’t to be your mom and tell you what to buy so you can hold them responsible for your Ls you dumb fuck.

The point is to alert you to a potential opportunity and little known information or a specific insight. From there you do your own DD and make your own decision.

Same here retard.  Spent the last month building up positions, long GME and HC🅰️C, decided, against the rules I’d set for myself,  to Yolo half my account on GME 12/8 calls, thinking the squeeze was imminent.  Up bigly for about 15 minutes Monday, then dropped like a rock.  Watched my positions bleed out all Monday, started panic selling Tuesday through Thursday to try to avoid margin call.  Finally got back into a decent position today, although without much free capital to start building back up, only to find out after hours that the positions I’d panic sold (HC🅰️C calls) had mooned in the merger announcement and would have erased all the weeks losses.  Expensive lesson on why not to trade on emotion.

Gonna take the weekend off and punch some trees to try to strengthen these paper hands.
I’m just starting to get into options and am buying cheap ones and only one contract. I was up 98% today and made $25, lost 50% on a different call for a loss of $15. I don’t know how anyone can handle these swings with yolo money. You’re down 50% then up 80% and it’s fucking nuts. You are all lunatics in here.

I'm extremely bullish on this IPO as well. However, I've never bought an IPO before. Do we get to buy the same day as everyone else and can we use Robinhood for it? Or do you have to use a different brokerage service? I just wanna make sure I get in on this as soon as it hits the market.
Shouldn’t be playing options unless you know the risks involved.

Thermo are making a killing off their PCR COVID test right now (and probably will continue to do so for quite some time). I work in the mass spec department and we're actually making losses (as are many other departments) due to customer's labs being shut or at reduced capacity. I think that we're doing a decent job of maintaining sales, given the situation, and they'll increase again post-COVID. The PCR test is going to continue to make way more money than other departments are losing.

Your strategy of buying call options is definitely a good one. Thermo's going to continue to rake in profits way into next year and I can see the share prices jumping to way above $504 before March.
Uh... yes!
Can anyone answer this question? So a lot of homeless people in Chicago approach me out of everyone and I usually give them more than what they ask but they always ask for more when I do this. Dude was asking for a $1 so I gave him $5 and he asked for more... 

So why do they approach me out of everyone? And why do they always ask for more?

You can still but 1/3 of a FD and make it to Tendie Town
Nope, thats the one I was referring to? Did I miss something? Did AMD beat that?
I simplified it for the explanation, but yeah it could be two different people on the open market. You could sell to some one going long and buy from some one else cashing out, but it's all the same to the call holder. The broker and owner of the stock are usually different people as well. The broker being a company and the owner/loan taker being a private individual, and they split the profit/interest, but if the call goes bad its on the owner/loan taker to come up with the difference.

I’m in on a lot of metals, but lost money buying high and letting options expire lol.
I've been adding to some bearish positions (not the best use of capital but it hasn't been that bad). I mostly sell naked calls now if I'm bearish these days so it can still go up (just not up a ton) and I can win.
This is an awful idea.

I would wait for the correction to be over anyway. I think it'll settle in the low to mid 30s. It was time for it to come back anyway with all the investor exuberance. $70BB(?) valuation for a company that makes 5,000 cars a month is ridiculous. Most of the 3,000 shares I own I bought around $3.50 each so Im fine with a temporary correction. I expected $45 a share to not happen anyway for another couple years.

As long as there are thousands of dogs in shelters being euthanized every day because no one adopts them breeding will always be immoral. The other issue is, and this comes from my girlfriend who is a Vet, pure bred dogs have many health issues due to the interbreeding and genetic manipulation for purities. So basically there's another moral question for you aside from the shelter dogs issue.

Yes. I really feel that AMD has the potential to fuck up both Intel (first in my opinion) and then Nvidia. In gaming PCs they have already basically won the intel race. If you want to buy a mid to upper mid range CPU u are most definately going to go AMD. And lower ranges also. As for gaming GPUs. If you want the newest Nvidia GPU you can go fuck yourself because there is none. You can however get AMDs newest one, which is relatively speaking the same. Actually, taking into account Nvidia 3080s fucking bomb out when overclocked (only some of them but still) AMD might be better bet.

One thing you can add to this... Melvin Capital actually made a ton of money off Chewy in 2017, so maybe a betrayal story of some sort is suitable lol
No especially NIO which is why they will do whatever to stay here. Its a gravy train for them, they won't give that up. They'll submit to US auditors and accounting principles in order to stay. Only way that would get derailed is if the Chinese govt bans it. This is just normal dick measuring between China and the US, They'll work it out.

I’m not greedy on BABA. I just sell covered calls and make a killing because IV is plenty high. I might not make as much as calls sometimes, but  it’s churned out good returns.
I don't understand options at all,  I thought you can only lose,  your initial investment.
I had PLTR 12/4 40C x5, I sold to close before it went too nutty, I lost about a grand,  I was told that the contracts expire worthless, and I didn't have to sell to close them.   Disabled options trading right after that debacle.
I mean anyone who says they have  system then says its all luck well it cant really be both. You can have hunches but there are too many moving pieces to really be sure of anything.

I’m sorry if I missed your point, I guess I’m still missing it. When you say you need to know one approximately it seems to me you still have a belief that somehow you can predict how the trade will go. In the context of this post, where the guy put 100% in one trade, it implies it would be allowable to put 100% in one trade that you know how will go. 

If you mean you need one trade on 1% of your capital that will pay 10,000% and double it then I apologize, I missed your point then. However even for options that’s an insane ROE.

Still waiting for BABA tendies. Let's hope selling goes on hold this week. Friday was weird AF, almost half usual volume and price pinned.

Planning to diversify my Chinese e commerce holdings with some JD eventually but for now I think BABA is the better move.

Bought some more NIO at $42, Will keep DCA on it until I get about $100k NIO in shares I think, at $50k atm.

Looking to do same with XPEV, currently $30k shares, looking to get $20k more.

Not sure how I feel about LI, their numbers are good but company seems less inspiring. I don't own any yet but I it's probably wise to also buy some of them too incase it moons.

My basic strategy for now is buy Chinese stocks while they are cheap with the hope shit settles down soon and that Chinese economy mostly undamaged by Covid will put out some really good numbers next year.
Can anyone recommend me a good book. Any book. I always start one chapter of a book then dump it. No matter what it is.

Nio is practically owned by the CCP and they won't sell it under any circumstances, therefore the share price should'nt be at the level it currently is. Imo it should be zero. No kidding.

If you own shares in this thing. I think the risk of potentially missing a news headline or an earnings surprise is too great. I got burned trying to do what you recommend. I had north of 3k shares and sold 400, 2 hours later Microsoft signed a revenue sharing agreement and GameStop was halted for trading. Then it shot up 50%. I’m holding through at least the March earnings report. Keep in mind also, they are buying 63% of their short term debt early, 3 days after earnings...things can’t be that bad if their cash flow is being used this way.

You really think the president of the United States is getting high on Sudafed of all things? You can buy pure ephedrine over the counter by the brand new BronkAid. If he really wanted legal stimulants he’d probably just do that. 

Or you know something better since he’s the fucking president

The ER and following investor call is exactly why IV has spiked. It would take a big announcement to make the IV go even higher afterwards. We're already at 225%+
That's pretty dope, good luck on your next trip!
Lol look at this salty hoe
They dont, but you can buy warrants. Its what ive been using to trade "options" in american companies. Still the selection is limited
I’m in at open, thanks
You can buy like 144 penny stocks and make it all back.

Yes. Its fucking immoral, don't do it.
this TA is about as reliable as the lotto no in my fortune cookie.
Please don’t ever try options. And if you do send us yr loss porn
There’s a difference between making money and being a total dip by downvoting anything negative about PLTR.

Yeah it's part of my wheeling stocks now. Sold some 9 bucks cc Dec 18 for 75 cents. Just trying to feel the movement so I'm going the pussy route.

Man just posted all my saved trades. Should have made them eod. Calendar spreads?
You’re a  damn fool. I stated that you should only take positions you have conviction in. You shouldn’t throw you’re life savings into a trade; that’s why I said you should be prepared to lose everything you put in. You don’t know what can happen, only put up what you can afford to lose. Set up smart exits for your positions and be prepared to take them, don’t hold to 100% loss of course, that’s a given.

The reason I highlighted the paper hands bit is because selling only to see the stock can have HUGE psychological ramifications. It can lead to depression, fomo, and revenge trading. Hence why I said don’t let it consume you. Even if you sell for a loss and your position would’ve been fine the next day, you have to take it on the chin because guaranteed money is better than potentially no money. The equity is what it is. Your mindset and mental health is far more important.
Very possible but airbnb getting my main sum
I’d rather be prepared for the worst
YOU LIED TO ME!

You missed my point. And why on earth would you go all in on one that you didn't know? That'd be pretty stupid. My point is that you don't need to know what 20 are going to do next week. (Which I agree is impossible.) You just need to know APPROXIMATELY what one is going to do 2-6 months from now.

I don't know much past calls and puts, but I do know that Robinhood does not process options well overnight. A lot of times there's an alarming number on your options, then it fixes when the market opens.

Yeah I knew this but I see occasional comments from people asking if they should buy leaps like 2022, but I get the impression it’s not for leverage. They’re just looking for something safe. But I was always under the impression 2022 leaps are basically the same as buying shares.

Right, unless you blow all your money in one before you make the trade you’d like. Plus honestly you also only need to win the lottery once, right? It’s a 1 in 53 million chance for example but it’s unlikely that it will be next time.
I think you will see an updated market cap with your broker once rollover is reflected. 40M shares of SPAC do not represent existing shareholders. The founder alone has 104M shares in LAZR.

You need to multiply market cap that you see from your broker by about 8 to get to the real value. You can read the details in SEC filing here:

This is very true Ive been paying like 5 bucks a month for that peacock streaming thing for a while now idk why too lazy to cancel it. The only show I watched was like 6 months ago but it was pretty good, a 10 episode miniseries adaptation of Brave New World. As far as stonks go I like the few companies that sell their own shit to the streamers. Well just Sony mostly. Maybe I would fuck around with like Lionsate too as a reopening play but they are pretty small cap. Also I just saw today that CbsViacom as been running up recently too.

False, that tax law that is newer. The progressive tax rates used to be as high as 73% then in the 80s trickle down economics became the trending lie and the butchered the higher tax rates and created capital gains tax treatments.

Does anyone remember how you got banned from WSB? I was sitting here and and bunch of bros were talking about sports and I was getting pissed cause I hate sports and think they are retarded (I was all county r/b f/b - hold track records - wrestled - varsity soccer 2 years - ski - bike - hike whatever fuck you). And anyway I started talking shit and got all pissy and said the f word. This was pretty soon after it was banned so I got caught up in the moment. Remember it like yesterday.

You should take a look at the report on TAN at [www.etf.com](https://www.etf.com). It looks pretty good, and solar is looking like the future. If this account represents your entire savings then the responsible answer to your question is to diversify your holdings.   Personally, I'd feel comfortable buying one or two leap contracts. It depends on your risk tolerance too. Compared to the plays that seem to be common here, your idea isn't nearly as risky.
Clang gang will jangle again
Do you have any that expire today plz?
With PLTR, I think 75% of shares were locked until mid February ish. Meaning only 25% of the company could be bought or sold from when it was listed. It will a massive shit when those other shares are unlocked in Feb. So... puts?
Confit (, French pronunciation: ​[kɔ̃fi]) (from the French word confire, literally "to preserve") is any type of food that is cooked slowly over a long period of time as a method of preservation.Confit as a cooking term describes when food is cooked in grease, oil or sugar water (syrup), at a lower temperature, as opposed to deep frying. While deep frying typically takes place at temperatures of 160–230 °C (325–450 °F), confit preparations are done at a much lower temperature, such as an oil temperature of around 90 °C (200 °F), or sometimes even cooler.

Haha bitch i aint no paper hands. 
Jkjk love u bro u aint no bitch u my nigga thanks for the support. I digged a little deeper in the fundamentals of BB and I believe its a sleeping giant and it is being awaken by all the EV hypes. It doesn't make sense for such a huge company in the automotive software space that have literally no competitors (maybe tesla??) to be valued so low. The only reason I could think of is that old boomers are scarred by the smartphone incident but since BB have totally changed their business model and with a somewhat new CEO I believe gen z are realising that and maybe (hopefully) they jump into BB
Yep I guess the answer is to look for value, because at least if it goes tits up you made a play you can justify?

I just checked the call option prices and didn’t see anything plausible in the 200 range. For example, the June 300C is about $5. Anything else is more expensive. Cheaper ones are too risky.

The big lesson is:

DONT GAMBLE YOUR LIFE SAVINGS!

But people will read:

DONT EVER SELL BEFORE EXPIRATION! (Paper hands)

Which is the the the second big mistake. First one is not having any portfolio risk management and putting 100% on a single, extremely high risk investment. The second being not having a defined exit point before you enter a trade.

People will say it’s not gambling lol. It is because you’re operating under the assumption that you can predict future prices. Test it and forecast the prices of 20 tickers next week and tell me how accurate you are.
Again, so basically Haiti?

Something's rotten in Denmark and it's not the ball cheese stuck to my leg
Yes very much so but I think it's a feature not a bug. Fed is trying to stimulate demand via the wealth effect. Higher demand is good for business. Better business conditions is good for employment. Better employment is good for demand. Higher demand creates inflation. Inflation reduces the debt burden. Reduced debt burden opens more room for more demand. And so on. It's a virtuous cycle...until it all blows up and then we get to hear about "whocouldanode??  nobody could see it coming. We're all in this together."

Lol buddy of mine got a 900 dollar knife on csgo sold it and bought more cases and keys if that’s not wsb I don’t know what is
Nice! And fuck you.
Don't know really because the option price moves with the stock price. Currently it's $8.13 for Feb. The delta is 0.33, so currently for every $1 increase in the stock price, the option will go up by $0.33. 
It all depends on your belief in whether the stock price will reach the breakeven point before the expiration date. I just say be conservative and don't get too optimistic about how much it can go up.
22k is still pretty nice gains. I’ll check it out thanks.

Don’t start day trading just over 25k, you want at least like a 5k buffer at 30k so that you’re not panic selling otherwise good positions on a weird bad day to stay above the arbitrary 25k

After 22 years in the game you’re being outperformed by noobs who jumped into the stock market out of boredom. With age comes wisdom, unless you’re you.
Are my 15 Jan APHA calls worth holding?
Bravo 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Doordash perspective its clearly profitable. For a restaurant its more like an advertising expense. The sales wont really be profitable or even in significant volume due to jacked up prices, but serves to let ppl know "hey do you remeber us? We are still open come check us out". Its kinda like a loss leader in a way, like when a business sells something at below cost to drive more customers into their store that will hopefully purchase other, higher margin items.
Hahaha

After 900% gains this month I'm so fucking salty about getting massacred by JKS. Obliterated my account and had to build from scratch. If I'd had my initial capital I'd be rolling in it. Lesson learned I guess. Do not put all your eggs in one basket.

Thank you brother
Paper handed 420 calls before the sp inclusion. Refused to chase so naturally it mooned. Won’t be chasing at this price.
Look at this STON stock it’s a Gme situation one dude owns 70 percent of the stock just regained compliance or something supposed to blast off next week
hold up. how is 400% a 40 bagger ?
Damn that end of day run felt amazing

I just don’t have the heart to trade Tesla like that. I like mixed media companies and mid-cap tech companies. Mixed media because it is pretty much an oligopoly market that after decades finally non-commoditized once again due to streaming revolution. I really like that long term story. Just two or three years ago I used to illegally stream everything, now I subscribe to Prime, Netflix, Hulu and YouTube.

Of course nobody knows. And I’m not betting against the market, I’ve learned much better than that over the last decade. But it’s still important to understand if there are real discrepancies from reality in how valuations are being constructed, trading off of just vibe would be equally reckless

I'm just going to slowly add to my position and sell covered calls or covered puts once I learn about that. Short term I see it getting hammered long term I can see 30+ by 2023.

Doing large plays with less risk is more profitable than small plays with more risk. 

Don’t buy $300 FDs when you could buy 200 shares of ARKK and sell covered calls.
It'll pass if the Republicans already loaded up on cheap weed stocks. Then they can approve it and pump and dump some stocks. Politicians shouldn't be allowed to buy stocks. Otherwise it's the same as insider trading.

its not normal to hit a 40 baggers. to hit a 40 bagger, you need to have 0 risk management and quite literally yolo a play that has near 0% chance of working. If you kept trading the same way after, it is almost 100% certain you would have lost everything.

I was in a similar position and ended up doing it when Webull offered 25 free stonks if you deposit 25k or more.

The first month I lost 8k, but I have recovered those losses in the second month and am up 6k now. You just have to be way more disciplined to avoid over leveraging. Take advantage of unlimited day trades by setting stop losses. Decide before you enter a trade how much you're willing to lose, and set your stop loss accordingly.
I also bought 101 shares for $16.81 each today. I can double the number of shares if the price drops a bit after earnings, but it's a guess at this point.
It's easy, you put money in and it gives you more money back.

It is better to earn those 25k from smaller trades than to start from there.
I wish I could ask my account questions
Dang wow calls are dangerous

Play by fire and gotta commit
I always wonder if I should try some cocaine then I see shit like this and realise it's just not worth it.
Basically we all buy short calls on the hopes for another +1000 point day. Which honestly might happen because we are all too stupid to wear a mask for 3 weeks so what the fuck else are we going to do but buy stocks and options, can't let my wife go to the restaurant with her boyfriend. We are literally trapped on a retard rocked that is powered by retard energy.
You could buy Tesla shares with that and sell puts leading up to inclusion lol

Do you not see the .AI. Back up the truck
Bullish, we're cleansing the gene pool
so right now you hold shares in those 5 companies. you sell covered calls for premium. and you do cash secured puts (NVDA) to pay for your margin interest?

You can't really compare them like that. VK was much more expensive when it happened and it had the sharpest trigger possible.

Gme will probably be a higher % increase but with a lot of diff factors depending on trigger and how fast it runs. The thing that cheers me up most though, is that last two console cycles have both squeezed to a market cap equivalent of 90 a share today
This is the wsb way

Doordash is such a shitty company. Their charge to the restaurant is around 30 percent of the gross sale. So most restaurants will have to eat a large portion of the cost themselves which cuts into their profit margin. They usually have to jack up the price as well to make up the difference. Restaurants run on razor thin margins so doordash sales are often unprofitable.

If you have the option just phone in orders to your local restaurant and pick it up yourself.

I guess what’s confusing is that if they’re going to go down, why are they up. The whole point is to secure the future cash flows, and if they’re predictably not worth this much, they shouldn’t cost this much either.

Newton was fucking autistic. Lose in stocks then try to turn lead into gold

Don't buy options if losing every single cent you put in would ruin your month or year. Day is fine, but you have to be over it by the time you go to bed.
eat more fiber
im on the same page with mid 2021 itm longs, stop-loss on shares, weekly hedges and itm index puts for spring. kinda want to see how bad a correction could hurt lol
It's why tech stock were relatively weaker today, they're higher duration vehicles and interest rates are moving higher. 

That said, stocks with PEs in the 80s are usually growing profits 15%- 30% or more quarter over quarter so that PE ratio declines all else remaining the same.

As to DCF, Jpow has committed to keeping rates suppressed until 2023. This coming week we find out if he's planning to monetize the incoming massive Treasury debt issuance  throughout 2021 and we all know that Fed balance sheet expansion = stonks only go up.
Cibc trades are cheaper. Pro tip is ask for a student account lol. It’s 6$ a trade
Will be 1000x whatever ours will be in 40 years though
What an absolute retard
I did a ton of DD on various banks and Settled on JPM because of tech yada yada ect ect. I saw that BCS was 5 a share and bought a ton because "its been around since the 1600 can't go tits up" and BCS has outperformed my JPM profits.  I think next is Cleveland Cliffs because i'm from Cleveland and basically retarded me is most profitable me.
Maybe crsr, aal, and pfe?
Oof. Hopefully you *never* give anyone tax advice, because you overlooked a very significant part of the equation.  The accountant isn’t stupid, but you seem to be. 

If you gain $270K in a year and then lose that $270K in the same year, you tax obligation is $0.   That’s the path OP is on. 

If you gain $270K and then lose $273K or more, then your comment becomes relevant. Assuming he’s not married and filing individually, then the magic number would be $271.5K.
I might do this with a grand regardless of anyones opinion.... but can someone explain why air bnb isnt a good investment as they can potentially overtake the hotel industry?
If you're putting your net worth into a single investment, you better damn well know every little thing about it (what the risks for the sector are, etc etc). The smooth brains on here aren't going to give you more than one word/emoji answers, but if it does go tits up, remember that no one here is answerable to you.
I’m guessing weekly?

Stupid option calls
I'm sure demand will be sky high for awhile yet. But if we have millions of foreclosures itll get ugly fast. Im just avoiding that sector for now
Doesnt look like it here champ.
CHWY is a good play for quarantine. Covid isn’t getting better this winter. No one wants to go to a store or a vet. You can do that all online? Great. Avoid other people and their pets as much as possible. Short term buy long term short
Taco Bell? You got any tendies in there? I always thought tendies would be a good addition to the menu.
I have over $25,000 but I haven’t put in the $25,000 required so I can day trade. I’m afraid I’ll get too greedy and lose it all. Has anyone else been in my place? Did you put in $25,000 and only do small plays?
I'm manifesting this for you.


Jk for me.
Then what the fuck are you arguing with me about? I agree with you that the bond market is physically twice the size of the us stock market.  I agree with you that the Goldman bond desk makes double the profit than their retail trading desk.  But also that has fuck all to do with normal personal investing.  The information that Santelli provides and what you are saying primarily is beneficial to institutional investors only and the average investor will see greater returns in the stock market than bonds Bc they have higher returns with albeit more risk.  

So what the fuck are you even arguing about my dude? Calling me uniformed.  For what exactly? You haven’t really told me what the problem is here
if you are worried why not just buy shares. instead your in options lol.
Weekend positions with DD:

ACB 10P 12/11 - Shit company and smart money will price-in the MORE act getting shot down in the Senate.

MRNA 170C 1/15 - Dec 17 FDA approval and imo another catalyst is Fauci being chosen by Biden as his chief medical advisor since MRNA is Fauci's favorite Rona vaccine.

BNTX 120C  1/15 - Within 2 weeks first line healthcare workers will be getting the first dose of the PFE/BNTX vaccine. This will be all over the news.

CCL 25C 1/15 - Retard strength will keep this rally going until it reaches pre-Covid levels.

AAL 20C 1/15 - Same DD as CCL, but I'm more bullish on this since there will be billions for airlines on the next Stimulus bill.

JKS 75C 1/15 - Autistic earnings play. Can't win them all. Probably will go tits up on this but I'm gambling on a big earnings beat.

I would be so tempted to put a nice down payment on a house.... but I know I couldn’t just pull out the market like that. I would definitely look to de-risk at 60k though. Thetagang, some high yielding dividend stocks for a little spending money, and some niche targeted ETFs would probs be my game plan with a few grand in monthly calls if I’m particularly bullish on a stock.

Why not just buy some puts on Monday to protect downside and if it doesn't tank sell the puts on Wednesday?
I’ll allow it, this time.

Ah gotcha. Yeah I was already holding calls and closed them when it hit 200. Grabbed some 12/18 210s with some of the earnings and a 12/18 190p in case it cools back down Monday/Tuesday. If it touches 195 I plan to sell the put and go in for 1/15 215c.

Paper trade while following wsb advice and see where that takes you. If make a lot of money following advice on this sub then I’ll start following you friend.
Whenever someone places emphasis on the strike price of their contract and the current price of the underlying and whether that gap can close by their strike date, I know they shouldn’t be trading options. This usually means they definitely don’t understand the Greeks and even more likely, don’t even know that they exist.
I’m following as well I have 100 shares of apple at $395 

Best of luck

Good eye, retard
So play this out for me... stocks are trading at prices like interest rates will be zero forever. Like the DCF makes no sense if interest rates go back up. But they have to go up eventually, even if it’s 10 years from now. But if you have a P/E of 85, it’s not like that’s going to pay off for a while. 

So how the fuck do stocks not go back down eventually? I know I’m not the only autist thinking about this.
My uhh umm old uhmm friend cornpop used say “if you ain’t cheatin you ain’t tryin”?
The fact that less than 0.01% of the comments here mention anything about Tesla's new battery tech that is already in the works tells you all you need to know..

Nobody gives a fuck that GM sells more cars than Tesla. Nobody gives a fuck that the P/E is 1200

People have realized that everything Musk says, he does. It may be late, but he always gets it done. Musk publicly outlined Tesla's plans for battery world domination on Battery Day, Tesla's FSD beta that is currently available is leaps and bounds ahead of any other widely available self driving tech (don't bother mentioning LIDAR - there is no comparison. Nobody is purchasing a Chrysler minivan with a gr.8 science project hanging off the roof for 100k and only driving it in downtown Phoenix because it's the only area it has pre-mapped)

Don't have a picture of my TSLA yolo but posted the PLTR gains that I rolled into GME
Really, like I over trading shiet and at end of week if I stayed in 1 position I would make same amount money like I made like 20 trades this week! I ended this week with 4k loss and 5.6 gain and if just left the shiet in one spac and did something else i would have more money at end!

Yooooo! Currently working.
I think what’s happening is companies are being brought to market through SPACs, and then they rocket up all of a sudden because, relatively speaking, they are “cheap” compare to their industry peers. The new company becomes the laggard, and an instant rocket ship of sorts.
Well you got the guy who borrowed 50k from a Robinhood glitch and lost it. He was really bad and didn’t make any money off of it but it probably wasn’t supposed to be legal.
haven't got it yet. I started reading some concerning reports on it. so might look at Wolf instead. though I'd prefer this one for the BTU's. probably 7-12k range.

I'm the opposite.  I went 90% cash late Jan/early Feb when I saw China locking down cities and knew this was going to be serious.  Except buying some BA/FCX/SILJ/SPG in April, I was maybe 75% cash most of the year.  This past month, I have been buying back in  and is only about 10% cash now.
I don’t know about instances of court-ruled fraud, but I have seen blatant market manipulation by single users with options on Verizon, Lumber Liquidators, and some others

I talking about decent position that you had and sold it too early and now is like 500%! I bought CZR for 10k in March, and sold it for 45k my 1500 shares! Now that shares would be like 100k and current ballance is 36k$ and it went down to 6.8k 1 month ago! I have stupid thing going through my head if I didn’t do anything I wouldn have 3x more money! Idk, but its literally killing me every day!

Numerous judges Mango/Repubs appointed during this term (and state ones) are rejecting or invalidating the "overturn the election" lawsuits. This shows a tremendous "rule of law" effort by the republican party/judges, and solidifies that their position is about their views and not their party.

To help would be you waisting your time. I’m just bored and I have nothing to do so I fantasize about ways I can kill my self without leaving a mess or fucking it up and ending up retarded. To get help would mean adopting a bullshit lie and I’d rather just talk about it on the internet so I can enjoy the one thing in life that I enjoy getting fucked up on drugs. To me life is worthless, people are worthless and I’m going to be this way till I’m dead. So regardless it’s a win win scenario for me. So I’d advise you to probably help someone else because I’m just an attention seeking loser who doesn’t care about anything. I’m just sooooooo bored

Hey guys, noob question. Just learned what a SPAC was yesterday. So is this like a new trend? Or not really. They just have high natural gain potential if you get in early enough? Or it just depends on the company they end up buying? #getrichquick?

Well it depends on the stock.
I'm not an expert on thetagang. I like Tuesday before market close because it gives me a sense of a safe OTM target.

I'm not looking to wheel the stock (letting it get called away, then selling puts on it). I'm just looking to get some small cash while I hold it.

If it were a stock with less volitility, I would sell calls on Friday for one week out. But I don't want to miss a giant dildo swing. I lost some money on NIO trying to buy my calls back.

I also try to find a target that I'd be more than happy and comfortable at letting them go if they got called away.

For me, right now that's anything past $30 at it's current price. But if it's sitting under $25 next week Tuesday, I'll probably sell them $28 strike.
Depends on the 1 stock? Tesla yea, something like RKT and you're bag holding 20k in shares and 6k in OTM calls bleeding out.
You’re not getting it. If I make 1mil at my job, but lose 200k on trades, the 200k does not offset the 1mil.
Eh hopefully GME sells a lot of game controllers and t-shirts, for your sake.

I like your insight. What are your thoughts on 
Bto 16c March expiry or  20c
Stc 18c                               22c
Bto 18p                               22p
Stc 16p all same expiry   20p

Upon finding s/r zones and backed by volume, ma, signals, etc, you sell a put at support and buy a discount call, sell a call at resistance and buy a discount put. sell the wings or sell the meat, I'm still figuring it out. Thoughts?
I love how half the comments here got it at $4... What are the odds
I bet you're right lol
I don't think OP's intent is for it to hit 30. Perhaps that's a good buy@ a good premium. 

OP mentioned to pull out near 40, with a 30p 12/16 purchase.

I think................
before you lose it all by rushing into your next play, definitely look into the wheeling or r/thetagang while you find the next hit
How about the 60k remaining to gamble. You got it.

I’m worried about you. DM me if you’re being serious so I can do something to help... idk what that is but I will try 💔
Yeah... you'll have to hope we don't gap up on Monday if you're wanting a call to protect your upside, or hope that we don't moon in general until you're out from under the $20c. Don't fomo, that's how people lose money. Theta gang is always a good play, though on a stock with moon potential like this you may want to modify your plays. 

Something I did on RIOT was own ITM calls and sell call credit spreads, essentially making them covered call credit spreads. You're losing some premium compared to just the covered call, but you miss a minimal amount if we moon.

You ask a question, “do we think this is a trillion dollar company in the next three years?” I answer, “yes, and here’s why with resource.” You don’t view the resource and call me a pussy if I didn’t bet on it. I did bet on it, and continue to. You say I’m triggered, now I don’t understand. I know in 2020 people think it’s a waste of time to try and sit across a table with people who you may find disagreeable for one reason or another, but in memory of my father who was incredible at it, I’ll give an effort here. I just want to help you, and anyone else with questions, really understand the Tesla phenomenon, and how and why this company deserves our support and the world behind it, and why it continues to receive that backing. And yes the work they and Elon are doing, in fact almost all of the work he does in various fields, is indeed inspiring. It pushes the boundaries of technology, and it’s all possible from his input. He crunches the numbers, tackles the designs with his team, he actually is a genius. Even moreso than Jobs, Gates, or many others, but that alone is my opinion, the rest is fact. Now you might not care about any of this, you may only care about the money you stand to make or lose, but they’re inherently tied together. So I just want to help you man. I want to see you financially free and also to feel good about your investments. Tesla has made a lot of people, myself included a lot of money, and will continue to do so. If you’d like to talk about it if it’s something you don’t understand or disagree with (you did post a question on a forum and here’s your opportunity), I’m here.

Well, the only way you get to “play money” status is through hard work and risk. Elon went all-in on Tesla. 250mil - risked all of his own money.
you made  7 trades and lost 30k. you're playing double or nothing. guess what. nothing hits 50% of the time.

A 10 point move lower for no particular reason other than unwinding the delta hedging is pretty egregious. Also, they're up against seasonal money flowing into the market as well as the consensus being a end of year rally, which creates a marginal bid higher. They're going with the flow.

800 rating so people stop abandoning lol https://play.chess.com/4auB
not how that works your taxed on the year end total not every transaction. so if you make 20k then lose 30k by the end of the year you get to deduct 3k in your tax return and the other 7k the following years and not get taxed on the 20k you made. If you make 20k the first quarter, lose 7k the second, and gain back 10k by the end of the year you wouldn't be taxed for 27k even though you are only 23k richer that would be stupid as fuck.

Yeah but I think it'll crash with everything else. In my heart I am a very much 🌈 🐻 and I expect us to go into an economic downturn somewhere after January 23rd and before April. Especially if we do another lockdown, but the fundamentals just prove Tesla isn't doing well.
That said we treat it like a tech company and there's always somebody willing to come by and buy it for a higher price.

James Clavell is writer with several books that take place in Hong Kong.  Absolutely not vouching for whether his books are accurate but he paints an incredible portrait of a culture (in all his books).  

He portrays the Chinese as big gamblers and hagglers, one of my favorite scenes is when an older woman is being mugged and she and the mugger are haggling over the fee.  There’s a lot more to the situation than that but that’s the gist of it.  Fantastic books, that was from Noble House I believe.

I disagree. I think Tesla has trillions in upside.

People need to stop comparing the future to the past. Ex: Tesla mkt cap vs Ford mkt cap.

Ford is dying. Sure they make profit but they are a commodity. They have zero edge. Zero revolutionary tech.

Personally I think Musk will be the first trillionaire. That guy only knows how to revolutionize industries.

IV doesn't always fall after events. It's less an explanation and more of an observation; IV movement can actually increase or decrease at any time, most stocks aren't interesting plays of course which is why the IV falls so hard but for those that are IV can sustain or even grow. GME earnings is *not* the event sought so IV may not react at all.
Remember, green is good!
This entire argument is a strawman. We all agree that crowded grocery stores and Lowes are unnecessary as well, so they've had capped capacity as well.

Meanwhile you completely ignore that these stores are not all crowded (while some bars are) and failed to even use the word "mask" in your entire comment when in reality *that is the entire argument here*. Restaurants are the one place you are allowed to take your mask off, nobody is going to Lowe's maskless, then getting there and sitting stationary breathing the same air as strangers that are sitting *exactly* 5'11" away.

I’m not quite understanding your reasoning. The fibonacci level isn’t until 385-388. You need to understand the Algorithm doesn’t care about valuation and as much as you want it to tank, your far better to take shorts on individual stocks that are heavily overvalued. Take SNOW for example: heavily overvalued with a low float of publicly traded shares. On December 14th insiders can reduce their positions by 25%. And to top It off, it just had a massive short squeeze. Bears must be patient in order to win and your position is more or less a gamble. Enjoy theta burn or the tattoo. I’m the Bane of bulls and your no bear.

Such a terrible comparison. No the Tesla is not the iPhone to the Motorola razor. You were flashbanged by the giant center console display and lane keeping assist, both of which any major car manufacturer could replicate. There is no technological revolution in a Tesla that is disrupting driving like smartphones disrupted communication. You still have to drive them, you still use a steering wheel and a gas pedal, it’s a dolled up car that doesn’t use gas.

I sold 1 contract at 32, one at 21, and 1 at 20. The expiration for the one at 20 was 12/4. So, that one expired. The one for 21 expires next week.

Typically after the earnings release. Same day.
A portfolio manager of a passive index fund will buy on Dec 21st regardless of their personal opinion about the fair value of the share. They’re not buying before or after because both outperformance or underperformance results in tracking error, the difference between the fund’s performance and that of the S&P.

It’s all about the percentage. The rich people I know always talk about keeping a set amount “dry powder” to go heavy on big plays at any time. It always seems like a crazy amount but then you realize it’s like 5% of their somewhat liquid assets. That’s always a humbling feeling.

I have a 1000cc sport bike that will burn your tesla TO THE GROUND that costs 1/10 the amount of a base model. Thats actually dope. Tesla’s are boner fide dildos on wheels. Who in their right mind wants a toy car that can only pull from 0-60 but then lags from their on out. And don’t go saying oooooh its the “tech”. You have a damn flat screen tv as your dash. Who tf cares. Also I don’t care how many modes or apps you have or updates. Your car is still simply a car that runs on batteries, still weighs more than an f-150, still doesn’t corner well, still wears down roads quicker, still takes forever to charge, still runs poorly in colder or hotter climates, still has simple problems like your door handle sticking, still costs more than 3 honda civics, still has dealership support issues, still can only run one racing lap at full capacity,

They'll never get it man. They just see dollars and businesses lost, not the fact that a restaurant is literally the one place that you can go right now, walk right in completely unvetted off the street, take your mask off, and a stranger is forced to interact with you.

Meanwhile if you take your mask off on a flight you are literally banned for life from that airline. Take your mask off in an Uber? Banned for life. Take your mask off in one of the "big box stores" and you'll be asked to leave. Walk into a bar and get a drink in your hand though and you can toss that mask right in the trash, won't be needing that the rest of the night.

I’m not really sure what to expect. They’re not entering it in tranches, which is interesting. I’m bullish on TSLA short term, but I think over the next two years it’s price will come back down to earth as more EV options become available in the US.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they do another offering to raise capital. That would presumably bring the price down a bit as well. Also have to consider that it’s at an ATH currently. That gets people excited but last time this happened, it was followed by their split, which initially pushed things higher but then they got all the way down to $380 (I think). TSLA is volatile and unpredictable. I’d milk that weekly covered call formula as long as possible.

We can't let Melvin take the **power** from the **players**
keep a journal. sounds lame but you learn a lot through analyzing and reflecting your mistakes. you'll start building your own system that works for you. 

Never risk more than 5 - 10% (really the professional traders keep it 1-2 but that's b/c their principals at least 6 figures). Since you're not at that point, you'll prob want to yolo and if that's the case, never risk money that you can't lose or borrowed from someone. trading from a hole clouds judgement and it can be a bad spiral
